"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors slipped on shiny new rings, unfurled a championship banner, then got their title defense started with a hard-fought victory. Fred VanVleet scored a career-high 34 points, Pascal Siakam fouled out with 34 points and 18 rebounds, and the defending champion Raptors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 130-122 in overtime on Tuesday night in the NBA's season-opening game. ""Pascal and Freddy, they are the young core, they are the guys who will carry this thing on,"" Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. ""I'm so happy for those guys to go out and perform like tonight. We'll see them grow all year."" Lowry scored 22 points, including a pair of free throws that put Toronto in the lead for good, and Serge Ibaka had 13 as the Raptors won their seventh straight season opener and posted their eighth win in nine meetings with the Pelicans. ""It's very fun to be in the position that we're in where we just won it but we're kind of on the climb again,"" VanVleet said. Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday tied it at 122 by making a pair of free throws with 2:23 left in overtime. Lowry answered with his foul shots, VanVleet hit a corner 3, and Lowry also connected from long range to cap a decisive 8-0 run. ""They made a couple of big plays at the end that gave them separation,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""That was the difference in the game."" Brandon Ingram scored 22 points and Josh Hart had 15 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, which began the season without No. 1 pick Zion Williamson. JJ Redick scored 16 points, Nicolo Melli had 14 and Holiday added 13. The Pelicans made 19 turnovers, leading to 22 Toronto points. Twelve of New Orleans' turnovers came in the second half and overtime. ""We played hard, but we've also got to play smart,"" Gentry said. ""We didn't play smart down the stretch there."" Lowry made a pair of free throws to tie it 117-all with 29 seconds left in regulation, and Toronto's Norman Powell grabbed the rebound on a missed shot by Holiday, giving the Raptors one last shot with 8.9 seconds to go. Powell got the ball, but his long 3-pointer hit the back of the rim and bounced out, sending it to overtime. Before the game, the Raptors received the biggest championship rings in NBA history and unfurled a banner celebrating their six-game triumph over Golden State last June. ""I have to start lifting more weights so I can carry it around,"" VanVleet joked. The Raptors lost NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard to the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency, and also saw guard Danny Green leave for the Lakers. Before the game, Gentry said losing a star player doesn't always hurt a team's fortunes. ""Bryce Harper is gone, too, but where are the Nationals?"" Gentry asked rhetorically about Washington's World Series baseball team. ""I wouldn't count these guys out just yet."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson is expected to miss at least six weeks after right knee surgery Monday. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound former Duke star averaged 23.2 points in four preseason games. He missed New Orleans' final exhibition game in New York last Friday night. Raptors: Toronto was without forwards Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (left groin) and Patrick McCaw (left knee). NO CHARGES FOR UJIRI California prosecutors said Tuesday they won't charge Raptors President Masai Ujiri for an altercation with a sheriff's deputy after the NBA championship clincher in Oakland last June. The DA's office said it met with Ujiri and his attorneys Monday and decided the matter was better handled ""outside of the courtroom."" BACK OFF! VanVleet was frustrated after rolling his ankle late in the third quarter when he landed on a courtside cameraman. ""How many times does it have to happen before you think about doing something else?"" VanVleet said. ""It's happened to me at least four or five times in the last two years. This is the worst."" VanVleet was able to return, playing eight minutes in the fourth and all of overtime.","401160623"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard hit seven straight shots in one stretch, creating a run for the Clippers that his new teammates quickly joined. ""It's a great sign of leadership,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""He talks with his game."" Leonard began a new career chapter Tuesday night, scoring 30 points to go with a strong bench effort in a 112-102 victory over LeBron James and the Lakers in the teams' season opener. Leonard chose the Clippers because he wanted to come home and his family was on hand. ""All those emotions went through me again,"" he said. Lou Williams added 21 points and Montrezl Harrell had 17 off the bench when the Clippers began their 50th season overall and 36th in Los Angeles as the once unlikely but now favorites to win the franchise's first NBA championship. ""It's one of 82 (games),"" Rivers said. ""Next question."" Leonard won his second NBA title last season in Toronto. The Lakers showed off their new 1-2 punch of James and Anthony Davis. Davis scored 25 points, making 9 of 14 free throws, and James had 18. ""For us, we're both aggressive,"" Davis said. ""Sometimes we kind of miss each other. I missed him a couple times and he missed me, so just trying to figure it out."" Danny Green outscored them both with 28 points, including seven 3-pointers, in the highest-scoring debut by a Laker in franchise history. Leonard got it done without his personal recruit Paul George, sidelined indefinitely while rehabbing from a pair of offseason shoulder surgeries. ""It's just the first game of the season, so it's going to take the season and mistakes and success to get us on the same page,"" Leonard said. Wearing a black tuxedo jacket and bow tie, George received a mixed reaction when introduced in the playoff-like atmosphere at Staples Center, where the Clippers were the home team for the first of four meetings in the arena the teams share. ""Their fans were very loud early and I thought our fans took over from that point on,"" Rivers said. ""It's great for the city."" The Clippers' reserves outscored the Lakers' bench, 60-19. Last season, Williams and Harrell were the NBA's highest-scoring reserve duo, and they picked up where they left off. ""This bench is going to be better this year than even last year,"" Rivers said. It came down to the fourth quarter, and the Clippers dominated. Tied 85-all, they opened with a 19-7 run to go up 104-92. Five different players scored and Leonard assisted on Maurice Harkless' 3-pointer. James had three of the Lakers' six turnovers in the fourth, when Harkless and Leonard each blocked shots by Dwight Howard. ""That was just very careless and they capitalized off of it,"" James said. With 4  1/2 minutes left, Lakers fans chanted ""Let's go, Lakers! Let's go, Lakers!"" while others hit the exits. ""The NBA's back and everyone's trying to have the narrative of it's a rivalry game and it's a huge test,"" James said, ""but I think both teams are not where they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve."" The Lakers erased a 14-point deficit in the third, led by Danny Green's 18 points. He capped a 15-0 run with his fifth 3-pointer before JaMychal Green's 3-pointer pulled the Clippers into an 85-all tie heading into the fourth. The Clippers outscored the Lakers 40-29 in the second quarter, buoyed by 16 points from Leonard. He made seven straight shots on a variety of moves -- pullups, fadeaways, a cutting dunk. The Lakers raced to a 13-2 lead, their largest of the game. James scored over Leonard and he later heard ""MVP! MVP!"" chants while sinking his first free throws of the season. The Lakers shot 53% from the floor in the first quarter, while the Clippers missed shots and had a basket by Williams taken away when the Lakers challenged a foul call on Howard. The rivalry was on early with a male fan shouting ""Go Lakers!"" during the national anthem, drawing big cheers while Clipper fans booed. ""It was everything I expected,"" Davis said. ""Very anticipated game and it was fun."" TIP-INS Lakers: They fell to 43-29 all-time in season openers. ... G Rajon Rondo (sore right calf) sat out. Clippers: They improved to 25-25 in openers all-time, but still trail the Lakers 3-2 when the teams meet in a season opener. ... G Rodney McGruder (right ankle sprain) missed the game. WARNING FANS As part of the NBA's crackdown on fan behavior this season, cards carrying a message from league security were on seats located courtside and the first couple rows back. They reminded that every fan is required to comply with the league's fan code of conduct and anyone who acts inappropriately may be subject to ejection and-or revocation of their tickets. The public address announcer reminded fans before both halves about minding their manners. LEONARD'S GREETING Leonard took to the mic to welcome Clippers fans to the game. He had to raise his usually low voice to be heard over the din, a mix of cheers from Clippers fans and boos from Lakers fans. ""It's going to be a great season,"" Leonard said. ""We're going to play hard every night. Let's get it going."" STARRY NIGHT Famous faces came out, including Kate Hudson, Angela Bassett, Jeff Garlin, and athletes Lisa Leslie and Diana Taurasi of the WNBA, Joc Pederson of the Dodgers and soccer player Alex Morgan. Halsey performed outdoors at LA Live before the game and Ty Dolla $ign rapped at halftime.","401160624"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  When Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak took PJ Washington with the 12th pick in the draft, he suggested the Kentucky forward might spend this season bouncing back and forth between Charlotte and its G League affiliate to gain experience. Washington had other ideas. The 21-year-old was stellar in his NBA debut, scoring 27 points on 7-of-11 shooting from 3-point range as the Hornets opened the post-Kemba Walker era with a thrilling come-from-behind 126-125 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. Washington's seven 3s set an NBA record for a player making his debut, and his 27 points were the most since Gordan Giricek in 2002. Washington, who wasn't named a starter until 90 minutes before tipoff, laughed when asked about the idea of playing in Greensboro. ""Definitely I used that as motivation,"" Washington said. ""It's not a bad thing to go down to the G League and produce and get some playing time. But I didn't want to. I wanted to be up here on the biggest stage and improve my game every day."" Washington won't be going anywhere if he plays anywhere near like he did against the Bulls. He led the charge for the Hornets, who made 23 3-pointers, setting an NBA record for the most 3s in a season opener. It was also the Hornets' most 3-pointers in a regulation game. The franchise record is 24, set in a game that had two overtimes. Backup point guard Devonte Graham was a difference-maker off the bench with 23 points on 6-of-7 3-point shooting to go along with eight assists, while Marvin Williams had 17 points on five 3s. Washington, Graham and Williams were a combined 18 of 25 from 3-point range, offsetting the Bulls' 78 points in the paint. ""They got open looks and they got comfortable,"" said Chicago's Lauri Markkanen, who finished with 35 points and 17 rebounds. ""Even if our hand was up, they were making shots. So, 23 3s is way too many."" Cody Zeller added 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte. TIP-INS Bulls: Outrebounded the Hornets 49-41. ... Allowed the Hornets to shoot 52.3% from 3-point range. Hornets: Coach James Borrego went with Rozier, Dwayne Bacon, Miles Bridges, Zeller and Washington as his starting five, a combination that has just 13 years of combined NBA experience. ... The previous record for points by a Hornets rookie in a season opener was Emeka Okafor with 19. ... Nic Batum left the game in the second half with a broken finger. GRAHAM STEPS UP Graham played so well that he replaced high-profile acquisition Terry Rozier at point guard in the game's final minutes. He led the Hornets back from a 10-point deficit with less than 6 minutes remaining, knocking down a pair of 3-pointers to ignite a rally. Graham also had two key free throws with 11.3 seconds to put the Hornets up by three late in the game. ""Just keep shooting,"" Graham said. ""My coaches keep telling me to let it fly and they have a lot of confidence in me, so I just have to come out here with that same confidence that they believe I have."" FORGETTABLE DEBUT Rozier, who was brought in as Walker's replacement, struggled in his Charlotte debut with seven points on 2-of-10 shooting. He had six assists but turned the ball over four times. COSTLY DECISION Instead of going for a 3-pointer to tie the game with 4 seconds left, Zach LaVine drove for a layup. The Hornets ran out the clock from there with the Bulls unable to foul. ""I think he was hoping it was like six seconds, but it was four and a half,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. WHITE'S HOMECOMING Chicago got a strong game from its top draft pick Coby White, who had 17 points, seven assists and only one turnover in his NBA debut in his home state. ""I feel like I played with a lot of effort and a lot of energy,"" said White, who was 6 of 13 from the field. ""I felt like I could have hit more shots, but shots aren't always going to fall so I'm not going to be too hard on myself. For me, it's all about winning so I'm kind of discouraged we didn't come up with a win."" IN THE PAINT Borrego said if the Hornets give up 78 points in the paint on a regular basis, ""that's going to cost us a lot of points. Our defense has to be better.""","401160625"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Andre Drummond softened up the perimeter by hammering away in the middle. Luke Kennard finally took advantage late. It was quite an opening-night combination for the Detroit Pistons. Drummond scored 32 points, grabbed 23 rebounds and blocked four shots while Kennard made half of his career-high six 3-pointers in the final six minutes to help the Pistons pull away for a 119-110 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. ""I'm glad he (Drummond) is on my team,"" Derrick Rose said after his Pistons debut. ""It just feels good to win, especially the first game."" The Pacers had billed their opener as the debut of a new era complete with four new starters and a retro lineup with 6-foot-11 Myles Turner and 6-11 Domantas Sabonis playing alongside one another. But Drummond and Kennard ruined the big unveil. The league's three-time rebounding champ was a wrecking ball right from the start, knocking down 12 of 18 shots and even making his last eight free throws after missing the first two. Kennard warmed up late, scoring 16 of his career-high 30 points in the final 11 minutes. Indiana never recovered. Sabonis had 27 points and 13 rebounds and Malcolm Brogdon added 22 points in his first game with the Pacers. ""We got outworked tonight, I think,"" Turner said after scoring 25 points. ""That's one thing we hang our hat on here, outworking people. I think we got outworked and they were a little grittier than we were."" It was far from pretty, though. The teams combined for 33 turnovers and 29 fouls resulting in a back-and-forth game in which neither team seized control for long. Indiana extended a 55-54 halftime lead to 73-64 midway through the third quarter then nearly gave it all away as the Pistons closed to 86-83 after three. Drummond helped the Pistons trade punches early in the fourth, just long enough for Kennard to heat up. When he knocked down the second of back-to-back 3s to end an 8-0 run with 4:40 to play, Detroit led 105-101. His third 3 of the quarter, with 1:24 left made it 113-103 and sealed the Pacers fate. ""I love the way we fought,"" Kennard said. ""That was great to come into an atmosphere like this, opening night, for a team on the road it's not always easy to come away with a win. TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond, the NBA leader in double-doubles last season, moved within one game of tying Shaquille O'Neal (34) for the second-most 20-20 game since 1988-89. ... Rose had 18 points and went 5 for 5 from the field in the first half. ... Tony Snell scored 10 points on a night the Pistons committed 18 turnovers. ... Detroit's bench outscored Indiana 57-16. Pacers: T.J. Warren was taken straight to the locker room with 3:46 left after taking a hard spill following an offensive foul. He finished with 10 points. .... Brogdon was 10 of 11 from the free- throw line, and Jeremy Lamb scored 10 points in his first game with Indiana. ... The Pacers were outrebounded 45-36 and lost on opening night for the first time in four years. OLADIPO UPDATE Two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo has participated in two five-on-five practices since he was cleared by team doctors late last week. So far, coach Nate McMillan said Oladipo has had looked fine. But he's also likely weeks away from taking another big step. ""He looks OK out there,"" McMillan said, noting Oladipo is only practicing every other day. ""He wants to play a little more but he's limited for what he can do for the next month or so before he gets re-evaluated."" REPLACING THE PISTON Six-time All-Star Blake Griffin missed the game with an injured left hamstring and a sore knee. And until he returns, the Pistons may find themselves cobbling together spare parts till he can return. But coach Dwane Casey had to like what he saw Wednesday. When times get tough, that's when everyone looks to Blake,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""You know when you go a couple possessions without a basket, we usually look to Blake. So in those situations, who do we go to? I think that's what we have to find out.""","401160626"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Markelle Fultz's first show in Orlando was a big hit. Fultz had 12 points and six assists, helping the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 94-85 on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. ""He was the difference in the game in the second half,"" coach Steve Clifford said. Fultz was selected by Philadelphia with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft. The 21-year-old guard played 33 games in two seasons with the 76ers before he was traded to Orlando in February. He was the first Magic player off the bench with 7:10 left in the first quarter. He made his first four shots. ""Anytime you have a chance to see the ball go in the hoop, the basket just keeps getting bigger and bigger,"" he said. ""It just gave me more confidence. It made me say: `Hey, it's back. I'm good. Let's just keep moving."" Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and nine rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 16 points. Kevin Love had 11 points and 18 rebounds for Cleveland, which trailed by as many as 20 points. Collin Sexton and Tristan Thompson each scored 16 points in John Beilein's first game as Cavs coach. Darius Garland finished with eight points on 3-for-9 shooting in his NBA debut. Garland was drafted by Cleveland with the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft. Fournier scored to give Orlando a 53-33 lead with 2:37 left in the first half, but Cleveland battled back in the third quarter. Sexton made a 3-pointer and Thompson had two straight buckets to trim the Magic's lead to 59-54 with 7:31 left. The Cavaliers were down 73-67 early in the fourth when Terrence Ross and Mo Bamba each made a 3 to help the Magic pull away. ""There were a few key moments when we had wide-open shots and missed them, and they had wide-open shots and made them,"" Beilein said. ""We get it to five and then all of a sudden it's 12. Then we get it back to five or six and all of a sudden it's 12 or 14."" HOW TO GET BETTER Beilein figures the Cavaliers will get better just by playing. ""There's nothing like being in game shape,"" Beilein said before the game. ""How do you get in game shape? You play games. You'll improve exponentially once you start playing games, and that's where the improvement should really spike now."" REBOUNDING DEFICIENCY ""We did a lot of good things, but the rebounding game was a problem,"" Clifford said. ""We haven't rebounded in preseason and we didn't rebound tonight. And turnovers. We were just really sloppy with the ball and that was really impacting how we play."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love (18), Larry Nance Jr. (14) and Thompson (11) led Cleveland to a 54-46 rebounding edge. ... Garland also had five assists. Magic: Fultz shot 6 for 12. He missed all three of his 3-point attempts. ... The Magic have won five of eight against the Cavaliers since losing 17 straight.","401160627"
"Kyrie Irving discusses his first game as a Net and what he could have done differently at the end of overtime. (1:48) NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving fell down and frantically rose up, still with a shot to save his Nets debut. Moments later he was back on the court, laying on his back in disbelief after falling just short in the highest-scoring first game for a team in NBA history. Irving scored 50 points but lost his balance and missed a potential winning shot that allowed the Minnesota Timberwolves to pull out a 127-126 victory over Brooklyn in overtime Wednesday night. Despite the loss, Irving said the first game in his new uniform felt incredible. ""It's a great starting point,"" he said. ""Obviously, you wanted to come out and get a win in front of our home crowd, but we got another chance on Friday."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 36 points and 14 rebounds for Minnesota, and Andrew Wiggins finished with 21 points, including the go-ahead basket with 1:19 remaining. Following a Nets timeout, Irving had the ball in his hands with a chance to cap his dazzling debut with a victory. He ran the clock down and then began his drive, but went down after spinning near the foul line. He retained his dribble, got up and shot, but his jumper missed. He then fell back onto the court, hands on his head. After signing with the Nets during the summer, Irving broke Kiki Vandeweghe's record for most points by a player in his first game with a team. Vandeweghe scored 47 for Portland at Kansas City on Oct. 27, 1984. Irving finished with eight rebounds and seven assists. Caris LeVert added 20 points. Irving signed along with Kevin Durant in July, wanting to come back home after growing up in New Jersey. He had to pause during his remarks to the crowd before the game but had no trouble keeping his composure -- but ultimately not his footing -- once it started, making seven 3-pointers as the Nets tried desperately to win a season opener for the first time in seven years. But Brooklyn didn't have many answers for Towns, who also made seven 3s. Then in OT it was Wiggins, who shot only 10 for 27 but made two straight baskets after the Nets took a 124-123 lead. Irving sandwiched two 3-pointers around three free throws in just over a minute late in regulation, and with the game tied found a cutting Jarrett Allen in the lane. Allen was fouled but missed both free throws with 5.7 seconds remaining, and the game went to overtime when Wiggins missed a long jumper at the buzzer. ""This is a special group where very rarely this happens in the NBA,"" Towns said. ""Everyone in this locker room is here for one goal. That's to win."" Early on it was all Minnesota as it started its first full season under coach Ryan Saunders. The Wolves led 20-19 in the first quarter before breaking it open with an 18-3 run that lasted into the second and expanded their lead to 38-22. It would increase to 46-28 and Minnesota took a 68-56 advantage into halftime. But the Nets outscored the Wolves 37-20 in the third and it was close from there. ""It was eventful,"" Saunders said. ""You're kind of lost for words."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jarrett Culver, the No. 6 overall pick from NCAA runner-up Texas Tech, had four points. His parents and grandmother were at the game. ... Minnesota has won the last four meetings. Nets: Durant, recovering from Achilles tendon surgery, was the first player announced when the Nets introduced the entire roster before the game. He walked onto the court and eventually joined his teammates to watch from the bench. ... Brooklyn has lost seven straight season openers. ... The Nets signed Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, a former first-round pick, to a two-way contract. OPENING NIGHT EMOTIONS Irving spoke to the crowd from the court before the game and briefly had to stop his speech when it appeared he was getting choked up. ""It just hit me before the game,"" Irving said. ""I wasn't trying to get too emotional or anything like that, but I'm just a Jersey kid playing for his home team. There's nothing like it. This has been brewing since I was in fourth grade."" SLEEPING IN The Wolves opted against holding a morning shootaround. Saunders said the team will at times look to get players extra rest while on the road. ""I'll use the word fluid and say that it'll be a game-by-game decision and see how these guys feel,"" he said. ""Obviously we're a team that looks at analytics and looks at data and looks at numbers. We want to make sure we take care of our players and these players especially, the pace we were able to play at in preseason, we want to make sure these guys are rested.""","401160628"
"MIAMI --  An opening-night sellout crowd in Miami came to see Jimmy Butler. They wound up being enthralled by rookies Kendrick Nunn and Chris Silva instead. Justise Winslow finished with 27 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, Nunn scored 24 points in his NBA debut and the Heat -- playing without Butler, who missed the game for personal reasons -- put together a huge fourth quarter to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 120-101 on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. ""Just the beginning,"" Nunn said. His beginning had a heck of a finish. A 24-1 run in the fourth turned everything around for Miami, which trailed 86-83 after Grayson Allen scored the opening basket of the final quarter for Memphis. After that, it was all Miami. Nunn and Silva -- also making his NBA debut -- combined for 19 points on 8-for-10 shooting in the fourth, with eight rebounds and three blocks. The Grizzlies, total, managed 17 points, seven rebounds and no blocks in the fourth. ""Obviously a tough one,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said after his career debut. ""The fourth quarter is not indicative of who we are and what we can be."" Ja Morant, the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, scored 14 points and had four assists for Memphis. Jaren Jackson Jr. led the Grizzlies with 17 points, and Tyus Jones added 15. Morant got off to a fast start, making his first four shots and going 5 for 7 in the first half. He picked up his fourth foul 17 seconds into the second half, and finished 6 for 12 from the floor. ""I'm not focused on the positives,"" Morant said. ""For me it's just the negative. I felt I could have been better in a lot of places, help my team out with turning up the pace to keep us going. They capitalized on a lot of our mistakes tonight."" Goran Dragic scored 19 points for Miami, while Bam Adebayo had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Butler was with the Heat for their morning shootaround practice, then told the team around mid-afternoon that he would not be able to play. ""Everything is fine,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Heat were also without guard Dion Waiters, suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team, and forward James Johnson -- still out because of a conditioning issue that kept him from training camp and sidelined for all five of Miami's preseason games. Memphis hasn't won a season-opening game on the road since the franchise's inaugural game at Portland in 1995. The Grizzlies are 0-7 in openers away from home since. TIP-INS Grizzlies: None of the five players who started Memphis' opener last year are still with the Grizzlies. ... Jonas Valanciunas picked up four fouls by halftime, a first in his career. He'd had three fouls by the break on 73 previous occasions, including playoffs. ... Memphis had 60 points by halftime, a team record for a season opener. The previous high was 56 -- by Vancouver against Seattle in 2000. A year ago, Memphis had 39 at halftime of Game 1. Heat: Having Herro and Nunn in the starting lineup marked the fourth time in franchise history that Miami had two rookies in the first five on opening night. They joined Kevin Edwards and Rony Seikaly (1988), Udonis Haslem and Dwyane Wade (2003) and Mario Chalmers and Michael Beasley (2008). ... Spoelstra is beginning his 25th season with the organization. ALLEN RETURNS Ray Allen was back, and back in his spot. The former Heat guard attended the opener, and when he was introduced to the crowd after the first quarter, he went to the far corner opposite the Heat bench -- where he hit the overtime-forcing 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals against San Antonio, a series Miami would win in seven games. ""It's like I never left,"" Allen said. YOUNG DEBUTS Herro, at 19 years and 276 days, became the youngest player to ever start for the Heat. Morant -- 20 years and 74 days -- became the second-youngest player to start a season opener for the Grizzlies. Shareef Abdur-Rahim was 19 years, 326 days old when he opened for Vancouver against Portland on Nov. 1, 1996.","401160629"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid was popped in the mouth by an elbow that drew blood, rattled teeth, and stunned the Sixers' big man. Embiid shook off the knock after a short stint on the bench, then Philadelphia took off and won the first round in a bruising matchup between two teams expected to fight for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Embiid had 15 points and 13 rebounds, Ben Simmons scored 24 points and the 76ers beat the Boston Celtics 107-93 on Wednesday night. The season opener had a May feel from the opening tip. Boston and Philly roughed up each other, combining for more than 60 fouls. They each showed off their prized free agent acquisitions. But it was the Sixers who turned in a dominant fourth quarter. ""It felt like a playoff atmosphere, already,"" Philadelphia guard Josh Richardson said. ""It was ready to pop from the jump."" Philly's superstars can only do so much, and the other Sixers were clutch in the fourth when they needed them. Furkan Korkmaz and Tobias Harris buried consecutive 3-pointers -- after the Sixers had missed 21 of 24 through three quarters -- to stretch the lead to 10. Even without that scrutinized jumper in play, Simmons was smooth and sensational as he attacked the hoop for easy baskets. He used a nifty spin move in the paint to hit Kyle O'Quinn for a basket that made it 90-74. The packed house went wild as the backups, a weak spot in the postseason, put the Sixers on the decisive run. Simmons also had nine assists and eight rebounds, though he played his 161st career game without a 3. ""I'm skilled, I'm gifted, I'm pretty good at what I do,"" Simmons said. Gordon Hayward led the Celtics with 25 points. Jayson Tatum had 21. Kemba Walker scored 12 points on 4-of-18 shooting in his Boston debut, and Al Horford had 16 points in his first game with the 76ers. Horford spent the last three seasons with the Celtics and was one of the few defenders that gave Embiid fits. Horford signed a four-year deal to come to Philly and quickly became a popular teammate. Walker was signed to a four-year, $141 million deal, the most Boston could offer, but $80 million less than the Charlotte Hornets could have paid him over five seasons. ""Tough night for many of us,"" Walker said. ""I wish I could have played a lot better for these guys."" About the only sign of a rough patch for Philly came when Embiid was drilled by Jaylen Brown's elbow early in the third. Embiid pressed a towel to this face after the hit and did not talk to the media because of swelling. Brown was whistled for his fifth foul, and Embiid sat out for a couple of minutes. He hardly seemed bothered by his mouth the rest of the game -- he slid across the court as he tried to save the ball from going out of bounds, drawing a loud ""Let's go Sixers!"" chant. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston twice missed consecutive free throws in the second half, giving delirious 76ers fans a free dessert and fries at a food fast chain. 76ers: Allen Iverson was in the house wearing a No. 23 Trey Burke jersey. ... Rapper Biz Markie was at the game. ... The bell trolls for thee? Horford rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell. SLOW START Walker had a rough night from the floor, Tatum scuffled through 8-of-22 shooting and the Celtics shot only 37 percent overall. ""All that means with Kemba and Tatum, there are a lot of good nights coming,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. GAME SHAPE Embiid said at the start of training camp that he lost 20 pounds over the offseason and aimed for at least five more before opening night. Coach Brett Brown said he didn't know if the two-time All-Star center had reached his weight goal. Brown said Embiid's health is the ""best he's ever been,"" but there's work ahead. ""Is he an A-plus right now,"" Brown asked. ""No, he is not. But he is trending in the way that we want. And nobody asked him to be that on opening night."" The 25-year-old Embiid has never played in more than 64 games a season and has vowed to top that total in 2019-2020. The Sixers care more about having their franchise player healthy for the postseason than reaching some arbitrary number. ""I feel when I look at him, I think he looks healthy,"" Brown said. ""He looks like he's ready to have a great season.""","401160630"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic won a showdown with Bradley Beal because the star Dallas guard stayed in the game while his Washington counterpart was ejected after the last of several fourth-quarter exchanges between the two. Not long after, Kristaps Porzingis had a one-handed dunk on an alley-oop to help the Mavericks turn away a late rally by the Wizards. Perhaps not exactly how the Mavericks saw the European pair tag-teaming on the way to a win in their long-awaited first game together, but effective nonetheless. Doncic had 34 points and nine rebounds, Porzingis finished off his 23 points with the game-sealing dunk in the final minute and the Mavericks beat the Wizards 108-100 in the season opener Wednesday night. ""It's just hoops,"" Beal said. ""You see it when I got kicked out, he came over and he was the first one to dap me. We weren't fighting. That was just basketball, trying to frustrate him. He was kicking our butt. Had to do something."" Washington rookie Rui Hachimura, the first Japanese-born player drafted in the first round, had 14 points and 10 rebounds. The ninth overall pick out of Gonzaga scored his first points before Porzingis hit his first bucket as a Maverick. The Wizards had cut a 23-point deficit going into the fourth quarter to seven when Doncic and Beal were called for double technicals with 1:09 remaining. Beal was ejected when he was almost immediately whistled for a second technical. Doncic missed the free throw and a 3-pointer, but the Mavericks kept the ball alive and Jalen Brunson found a cutting Porzingis for the slam. Porzingis missed his first four shots before taking a break and coming back to score nine points in the final 2:45 of the first quarter. The 7-foot-3 Latvian acquired in a blockbuster deal with the New York Knicks before the trading deadline last season was 7 of 16 from the field. Doncic and Porzingis traded long 3-pointers throughout the game, finishing 7 of 16 between them (4 of 9 for Doncic, 3 of 7 for Porzingis). Doncic was 12 of 19 overall to help the Mavericks win their opener for the first time in four years. The Slovenian guard and reigning NBA rookie of the year could have played with Porzingis last season, but the Mavericks decided to let the 2018 All-Star continue recovering from a knee injury in what ended up being his final game for the Knicks 20 months ago. ""It's finally here,"" Porzingis said. ""I just want to enjoy the moment. I don't want to put too much pressure on myself when I'm out there. Most importantly I'm here to win. I'm not here to chase something individually."" Beal scored 19 points less than a week after the All-Star guard signed a $72 million, two-year extension that will go through the 2022-23 season, with a player option after that. The Wizards are without his backcourt mate, John Wall, who tore an Achilles tendon last December. ""Give our guys credit, they battled back and then they cut the lead to a respectable number,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""Brad came in and almost made it more interesting than the final score."" TIP-INS Wizards: Moritz Wagner was 3 of 4 on 3-pointers and scored 13 points before the second-year player fouled out with three minutes left in his Washington debut. ... Thomas Bryant had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Mavericks: Dallas still isn't sure how much longer Dwight Powell will be out with a left hamstring strain sustained early in training camp. The sixth-year player is expected to start at center when he's ready. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. left the game in the second quarter after injuring his right ankle but returned before halftime. RUI'S DEBUT Hachimura scored six points in the first quarter and finished 7 of 15 from the field. The 6-8 forward missed all three of his 3-point attempts, including one with the Wizards down nine points just inside two minutes. ""This is just the beginning,"" Hachimura said. LIFE AFTER DIRK The first look for Dallas fans at the Doncic-Porzingis pairing came in the Mavericks' first game at American Airlines Center without German star Dirk Nowitzki. Their last home game without the only NBA player to spend all 21 seasons with the same franchise was April 14, 1998, a 111-95 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at Reunion Arena. Nowitzki retired at 40 after last season as the league's highest-scoring foreign-born player.","401160631"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The lessons are coming early for New York Knicks rookie RJ Barrett. From his first NBA game? ""You've got to keep going, especially if you get up,"" he said. It's a concept Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray knows well. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points, Bryn Forbes added 20 and San Antonio rallied for a 120-111 victory over the Knicks on Wednesday night, spoiling Barrett's debut. The Spurs outscored the Knicks 37-27 in the final quarter after Barrett rallied New York from a 16-point deficit in the first half. Barrett scored 21 points on 9-for-13 shooting with five rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. ""You've got to keep putting it on them,"" Barrett said. ""Just like we're not going to quit, they're not going to quit either."" The Knicks have pinned a great deal of hope on Barrett, the No. 3 overall draft pick out of Duke, after failing to sign any marquee free agents in the offseason. ""I told you,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. ""When the popcorn's popping, that kid is ready."" Marcus Morris led New York with 26 points, and Julius Randle added 25 points and 11 rebounds. The Spurs are similarly counting on Murray, who played in his first game since tearing his right ACL in a preseason game last October. ""I'm blessed, I'm thankful,"" Murray said. ""I put in the work, but I've got a lot of work to do. A year ago today I was at home, I couldn't walk, and a year later I'm playing. So, I'm thankful."" Murray had 18 points, including a 3-pointer with five minutes remaining that put San Antonio up 105-97. The 6-foot-5 point guard had six assists and eight rebounds. ""I thought he was aggressive, tried to do what we wanted to do and played pretty good defense,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Probably needs to take care of the ball a little bit better, but overall after being out so long, he's come a long way pretty quickly."" Murray had four turnovers and San Antonio committed 21 as a team, which led to 32 points for New York. The Spurs did not have any turnovers in the fourth quarter, however. NOTHING SETTLED New York started Barrett, Randle, Morris, Bobby Portis and Alonzo Trier, but Fizdale said the lineup could change as soon as Saturday against Washington, especially at point guard. Barrett started at point guard, but veteran Elfrid Payton had nine points and four assists in the second half while running the point with Barrett at off guard. TIP-INS Knicks: Morris, who signed with the Knicks after backing out of a verbal agreement with the Spurs on a two-year deal, was heavily booed throughout the game. Morris responded to the initial boos by backing down and then hitting a turnaround jumper on DeMar DeRozan for the game's opening points. ... The Knicks signed F Ivan Rabb to a two-way contract. The 6-foot-10, 220-pounder averaged 5.7 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 14.6 minutes over two seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies. He will primarily play for New York's G League affiliate, the Westchester Knicks. Spurs: Trey Lyles, who the Spurs signed after Morris reneged, started at center and had eight points and 11 rebounds. ... Popovich opened his 24th season as San Antonio's coach, setting the record for most seasons coaching one franchise. Popovich was previously tied with Utah's Jerry Sloan. ... Popovich acknowledged the Spurs fully guaranteed the final year of Aldridge's contract. Aldridge was guaranteed $7 million for 2021 before the Spurs picked up their option Wednesday to fully guarantee his $24 million contract. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Soon as Donovan Mitchell started imposing his will on both ends of the court in the fourth quarter, there was nothing anybody could do to stop him. Mitchell's all-around performance Wednesday night led the Utah Jazz to a 100-95 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the season opener for both teams. On one end, the Jazz guard was crashing the boards and securing the ball. At the other end, he repeatedly slashed to the rim for one big basket after another. Mitchell finished with 32 points and 12 rebounds, becoming the first Utah player with at least 30 points and 10 boards in a season opener since Carlos Boozer did it to open the 2007-08 season. ""I just wanted to attack,"" Mitchell said. ""When you have teammates that trust you, coaches that trust you with the ball, it really makes it easy to keep going and make the right plays."" His biggest impact came in the fourth period, when Mitchell had 14 points and seven rebounds. He made several key buckets down the stretch to help the Jazz rally and snap a seven-game regular-season losing streak to the Thunder. Oklahoma City built an eight-point lead early in the fourth before Utah surged ahead 85-80 on a 9-0 run capped by Bojan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer. Chris Paul capped a 6-0 spurt with a long jumper of his own to put the Thunder ahead 86-85. Mitchell answered by slashing into the lane for back-to-back layups to put the Jazz ahead for good. A mid-range jumper from Mitchell gave Utah a 96-91 lead with 21 seconds remaining. Jazz coach Quin Snyder pointed to Mitchell's effort on help-side defense and his rotations as being an equally important difference-maker during that stretch run. ""He's much improved right now defensively because he's demanding it of himself and he's competing,"" Snyder said. Bogdanovic added 16 points and Royce O'Neale chipped in with 14 for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert grabbed 14 rebounds. The Jazz outscored the Thunder 58-34 in the paint to offset 6-of-24 shooting from 3-point range. ""We missed a lot of stuff at the rim tonight and generally we've been fairly good there and getting stuff downhill at the basket,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shined in his Thunder debut, scoring a career-high 26 points on 10-of-23 shooting. Paul added 22 points and eight rebounds. Danilo Gallinari had 21 points and seven boards. Oklahoma City missed nine of its first 11 shots and hit just 23.8% (5 of 21) overall from the floor in the first quarter. Those shooting struggles opened the door for Utah to sprint out to a 23-10 lead. Starting with a jumper from Joe Ingles, the Jazz scored baskets on four straight possessions to carve out a double-digit advantage. The Thunder made a pair of 8-0 runs to tie the game at 28 in the second period. They finally took their first lead after Gilgeous-Alexander made three straight baskets to fuel a 9-2 spurt. Paul capped it with a pair of free throws, giving Oklahoma City a 46-42 lead. Utah answered with a 7-0 run -- punctuated by a thunderous dunk from Mitchell -- to go ahead 49-46 at halftime. ""We learned we've got a lot of grit and fight with us, but there is no moral victories,"" Paul said. ""We felt like we let one slip away, but I do feel good about how we played."" SHOTS NOT FALLING Mike Conley went 1 of 16 from the field in his Utah debut after spending his first 12 seasons with Memphis. He missed his first 12 shots before finally scoring on a floater in the lane with 5.9 seconds left in the third quarter. Conley finished with five points after adding a pair of free throws with 2.1 seconds left. He made a big impact on the defensive end late, helping limit Paul and Gilgeous-Alexander to eight combined fourth-quarter points. ""I didn't want to just be out there missing shots,"" Conley said. ""I wanted to be out there helping the team as best as I can and I just tried to be that for the team tonight."" MEMORABLE MUDIAY Emmanuel Mudiay shrugged off a tough preseason that included a hamstring injury by scoring 12 points and dishing out five assists in his Jazz debut. Mudiay hit a pair of critical layups midway through the fourth quarter to help Utah rally. ""He's been doing the work,"" Snyder said.  ""Our whole staff is dug in on him."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City went 6 of 12 from 3-point range in the second quarter. ... Darius Bazley finished with zero points and three rebounds in his NBA debut. ... Steven Adams pulled down 11 rebounds but finished with just three points after shooting 1 of 8 from the field and 1 for 6 from the line. Jazz: Bogdanovic went to the locker room midway through the second quarter after injuring his ankle. He returned in the third. ... Utah finished with an 18-7 edge in fast-break points.","401160653"
"PHOENIX --  Coach Monty Williams wanted Jevon Carter to slow down. The backup point guard didn't pay attention. Two unexpected 3-pointers later, the Phoenix Suns had the spark they needed to blow past the Sacramento Kings for a 124-95 win in the season opener for both teams on Wednesday night. ""Jevon just doesn't listen to me, that's pretty much it,"" Williams said with a grin. ""He just goes nuts, hits shots and defensively he gets all over people. He has selective hearing. I was trying to scream to him to slow down, but he's a pitbull. That's what I love about him."" While the reserves stepped up, the starters played well, too. Devin Booker had 22 points and 10 assists, and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 21 points. Veteran guard Ricky Rubio had 11 points, 11 assists, six rebounds and four steals in his first game after signing a three-year deal worth $51 million. It was an encouraging night for a franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs since 2010 and finished with a dismal 19-63 record last season. ""We have a lot of potential, but it's just one game,"" Rubio said. ""We have to show it every night. Tomorrow we come back, go to practice and get better."" Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick one year ago, added 18 points and 11 rebounds while shooting 9 of 14 from the field. Sacramento was led by Buddy Hield, who scored 22 of his 28 points in the first half. Hield shot 10 of 19 from the field, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range. Marvin Bagley III added 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Kings shot just 28 percent from the field and had 18 turnovers in the second half. ""They had the momentum, they made shots, they made plays, they played harder than us,"" Hield said. ""They deserved to win."" Williams won in his Suns coaching debut. The 48-year-old Williams coached the New Orleans Hornets for five seasons from 2010-15 and got another opportunity with Phoenix during the offseason. The Suns trailed by five at halftime but rallied for an 86-76 advantage headed into the fourth. Carter hit back-to-back 3-pointers late in the third to give the Suns some unexpected offense, highlighting an impressive run by the Suns' second unit. Carter finished with 11 points, including three 3-pointers. Tyler Johnson added 10 points in 17 minutes. ""We just go out there, play hard and play together,"" Carter said. ""Sometimes it's going to work. Sometimes it's not. But I feel more times than not it's going to work."" EMOTIONAL NIGHT Williams also won as a head coach for the first time without his wife Ingrid, who died in a car accident in 2016 at 44 years old. ""First time I've done this without Ingrid and that was just different,"" Williams said. ""A lot of emotions, a lot of good stuff. So thankful my kids were there tonight for the whole game and got to see that. So glad I got to do that with this group."" TIP-INS Kings: F Harry Giles III (sore left knee) was held out. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Early foul trouble in the season opener wasn't going to get Nikola Jokic down. He had 20 points and 13 rebounds despite sitting much of the first half, and the Denver Nuggets spoiled the first game of Portland's 50th season with a 108-100 victory over the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Will Barton added 19 points for the Nuggets, who also snapped Portland's 18-game winning streak in home openers, the longest streak in league history. Denver made 18 3-pointers. ""I didn't want to force it. I just wanted to win the game,"" said Jokic, who had 16 points in the fourth quarter alone. ""I wanted to go out there to be the positive energy to win the game."" Damian Lillard led the Blazers with 32 points and eight assists, and Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 19 rebounds in his Portland debut. Whiteside, acquired in an offseason trade with Miami, tipped in Lillard's 3-point attempt to help the Blazers to an 88-87 lead with just under five minutes left. But the Nuggets answered with consecutive baskets from Jokic and Gary Harris. Jokic hit back-to-back 3-pointers to extend Denver's lead to 97-90. Lillard landed a 3-pointer with 1:58 left to narrow the gap but the Blazers couldn't catch up. ""Nikola in the fourth quarter was phenomenal,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""I think he had 16 and 8 in the quarter. He showed everybody why he's an MVP-caliber player."" It was the first meeting between the teams since the Western Conference semifinals, won by the Blazers in seven games. ""When the game was being decided, we just had too many lapses on both ends of the floor,"" Lillard said. ""We put ourselves in a position where it was going to be hard to come back from them."" The Nuggets didn't make a lot of changes over the summer, returning the nucleus of the team that won 54 games last season and earned the West's second seed, ending a six-year postseason drought. The team's biggest move was acquiring Jerami Grant from Oklahoma City. Portland, meanwhile, has six new faces on the roster, including Whiteside, who started at center. The Blazers also picked up veteran big man Pau Gasol as they await Jusuf Nurkic's return from a broken leg. The Blazers finished 53-29 last season and clinched the West's third seed, playing through to the conference finals for the first time in 19 years. Jokic collected three early fouls and went to the bench with 8:15 left in the first quarter, and the Nuggets struggled. ""In the beginning of the game it brought out a lot of memories from last year's series,"" Jamal Murray said. ""We just wanted to come out and have a good game and come out with a win."" Rodney Hood hit a 3-pointer and made a free throw to give Portland a 19-7 lead. Lillard's first points of the game came on a dunk that made it 21-16. The Blazers closed to 70-69 on Lillard's 3-pointer late in the third quarter and then tied it on Anfernee Simons' free throw. But they didn't regain the lead until Simons' driving layup made it 74-73 and capped a 16-6 run going in to the final period. CJ McCollum's 3-pointer pushed the lead to 79-73 and Portland held on until Murray's 3 made it 83-all. Jokic's jumper gave Denver back the lead before Whiteside's tip. ""They had won 18 straight openers here so to come in here and win on the road against a division rival to start the year off I couldn't ask for a better start,"" Malone said. TIP INS Nuggets: Former Oregon center Bol Bol, the son of Manute Bol, warmed up with the Nuggets but was not available to play. A second-round pick, he signed to a two-way contract with the team. ... The 18 3-pointers were the team's most for an opener. ... Michael Porter Jr., the No. 14 draft pick in 2018 who sat out last season as he recovered from back surgery, did not play for the Nuggets. Trail Blazers: Gasol, who is still rehabbing from foot surgery, did not play. ... Lillard addressed the crowd before the game: ""Rip City! Rip City! We would like to welcome you to our 50th season, and hopefully our best."" ... The previous record for longest winning streak in home openers was 14, held by Boston from 1979-92. WHITESIDE'S DEBUT: Whiteside gave his debut mixed reviews, lamenting Jokic's late 3-pointers. ""We need to get the 3-point defense down,"" he said. ""They made some tough shots, but we can definitely get better at defending the 3.""","401160655"
"DETROIT --  Trae Young feels like a veteran as he enters his second NBA season. That'sbad news for the rest of the league. Young had 38 points and nine assists and the Atlanta Hawks opened the season with a 117-100 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night. ""I'm a lot more comfortable than I was at this point last year,"" Young said. ""Obviously, I'm not a rookie anymore and I felt great out there tonight. Once I hit a couple shots, I knew it was rolling."" If anyone at Little Caesars Arena doubted how good Young was feeling, he made it clear midway through the second quarter, hitting a 3-pointer from the edge of the Pistons logo at half court. ""I knew it was deep, but I didn't realize I was on the logo until someone told me at halftime,"" he said. ""Ever since high school, I've known when I was in range and let it go."" John Collins added 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Jabari Parker had 18 points. Vince Carter checked in for Atlanta with 6:52 left in the first quarter, becoming the first player to see action in 22 NBA seasons. ""Vince stabilizes this team,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Our starting lineup has about half as many years as he does, and we've got a bunch of guys who weren't even born when he started. He didn't have a basket tonight, but the boxscore can't show you everything he did to help us win."" Derrick Rose led Detroit with 27 points, and Andre Drummond had 21 points and 12 rebounds. Drummond had 32 points and 23 rebounds in Detroit's season-opening victory on Wednesday in Indiana, but the Hawks scored 60 points in the paint. ""I thought we came out tonight with a laissez-faire attitude defensively, and they took the game to us,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We had a good game last night, but that didn't mean a hill of beans tonight."" Drummond, who played 78 minutes in just over 24 hours, didn't think that was the problem. ""I really didn't have time to ease myself into the game, but this was just a tough night for us overall,"" he said. ""We're NBA players. There's no excuse for the way we started the game."" Young's four-point play with 3:43 left in the first half gave him 26 points -- the highest-scoring half of his career -- and put the Hawks up 58-51. Rose, though, scored 15 points in the half and Langston Galloway's late 3-pointer gave Detroit a 63-60 halftime lead. The teams stayed close for most of the quarter, but back-to-back dunks by Parker -- one over Thon Maker -- put Atlanta up 88-79. Parker added two free throws, giving him 18 points, and the Hawks took a 91-81 lead into the break. De'Andre Hunter's 3-pointer extended Atlanta's lead to 97-83 with 8:47 to play. Detroit scored the next four points before the game was delayed for several minutes because of the clock failure. The Pistons narrowed the lead to 98-92, but a pair of Rose turnovers helped the Hawks scored the next seven points and take a 13-point lead with 4:47 to play. Detroit got the margin to single digits, but Young's three-point play with 1:33 wrapped it up. TIP INS HAWKS: Carter has played 62 games against Detroit, second only to the 64 he has played against the Boston Celtics. Only 11 players have faced the Pistons more often since the NBA-ABA merger, led by Robert Parish with 90. PISTONS: PF Blake Griffin (hamstring/knee) is expected to miss three more games before being evaluated for a possible return. OLD-SCHOOL BASKETBALL The teams played without game and shot clocks for three minutes in the fourth period. The time remaining was announced at each stoppage in play and the shot clock was announced at 10 seconds and counted down from five. The clocks returned to the scoreboard for the final six minutes, but the boards above the baskets remained blank. ""That was disappointing -- I don't know what happened -- but it disrupts the flow of the game when you are looking around to see the clock,"" Casey said. INJURY UPDATE Reggie Jackson left early in the third quarter due to back tightness. Casey said he will be examined on Friday to see if he can face the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday.","401160656"
"HOUSTON --  When Giannis Antetokounmpo fouled out with more than five minutes left after putting up a triple-double against the Houston Rockets, the rest of the Milwaukee Bucks didn't panic. ""These guys in this locker room, we're fighters, we're competitors,"" Wesley Matthews said. ""If Giannis fouls out we can't just come into the locker room."" Antetokounmpo scored 30 points and his supporting cast held on to lead the Bucks to a 117-111 victory over the Rockets on Thursday night in a star-studded opener featuring the last three MVPs. Antetokounmpo, the MVP last season, also had 13 rebounds and 11 assists. While certainly upset after fouling out, he was impressed with the way his team responded. ""They did an amazing job,"" he said. ""Moving the ball, knocking down shots."" Brook Lopez made two free throws with about a minute left before a layup by Russell Westbrook. But Lopez made a fadeaway shot to leave Milwaukee up 115-109 with 39 seconds remaining. James Harden added a pair of free throws before Ersan Ilyasova made a jump shot with about 15 seconds to go that sent many fans heading to the exits. Some had wondered what would happen with the pairing of the two ball-dominant guards in Harden and Westbrook after the 2017 MVP was traded from Oklahoma City for Chris Paul this summer. In their first game together with the Rockets both filled up the stat sheet, but they were unable to come away with a win after leading for much of the game. Westbrook had 24 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists. Harden, the 2018 MVP, added 19 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds. He was 2 of 13 from the field, 1 of 8 on 3s and made 14 free throws without a miss. ""They're going to be fine,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It's sad to say, but we're not going to win 82 games this year. Now we've got a chance to win 81."" The Bucks led by six when Antetokounmpo fouled out. He walked to coach Mike Budenholzer and implored him to challenge the call, but he'd already used his one challenge per game that coaches get this season and couldn't do anything to help his superstar. Harden echoed his D'Antoni's sentiment and raved about Westbrook. ""Everybody saw it tonight,"" Harden said. ""He's a different type of breed on that court. But it's Game 1, we're not going to get too down, and even if we won, we're not going to get too excited."" Houston scored the next five points, with the last four from Westbrook to cut the lead to 101-100. But Khris Middleton hit a 3-pointer with 3 1/2 minutes left to stretch Milwaukee's lead. The Bucks were up by six with about two minutes left before P.J. Tucker knocked a 3 from the corner. But Matthews added a 3-pointer for Milwaukee seconds after that to push the lead to 111-105. Milwaukee opened the fourth quarter with a 13-3 run to make it 91-90 and take its first lead of the night. Antetokounmpo led the way in stretch, scoring eight points. The Rockets missed several shots and had a turnover before they finally got back on track. There were about eight minutes left when Harden found Westbrook connected on two straight plays. On the first one Harden dished to Westbrook and he was fouled on a layup to get a 3-point play. The next time down the court Harden sent a bounce pass to Westbrook in the lane and he finished with a two-handed dunk that put Houston up 95-91 and brought a huge ovation from the crowd. But the Bucks made the next 10 points, led by five from Brook Lopez, who capped the run with a 3-pointer to make it 101-95 with about 5 1/2 minutes left. TIP-INS Bucks: Lopez had 14 points and four rebounds. ... Ilyasova had13 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. ... Milwaukee made 16 of 46 3-pointers. Rockets: Tucker had 17 points and made five 3-pointers. ... Houston also made 16 3-pointers. ... Clint Capela had 13 points and 12 rebounds. NBA/CHINA RELATIONSHIP A group of 30 fans held signs and wore shirts in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong at the game. Houston general manager Daryl Morey angered China with a since-deleted tweet in support of the protesters earlier this month. Wednesday's opening-night games were not televised in China in the wake of Morey's tweet that caused tension between the NBA and Chinese officials. One man held a sign the read: ""Thank you Morey,"" with a red heart after Morey's name. Another sign read: ""No censorship in America"" and a third declared: ""Freedom is not FREE."" Another man held a sign that said: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,"" which are the exact words included in Morey's tweet.","401160657"
"Draymond Green claims he's not into moral victories and blasts the Warriors' execution in their opening-night loss to the Clippers. (0:36) SAN FRANCISCO --  Kawhi Leonard sure knows how to spoil Golden State's fun. Leonard did it again in the Warriors' first game at Chase Center just like in their farewell at Oracle Arena four months ago, scoring 21 points in three quarters to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 141-122 victory Thursday on opening night at Golden State's snazzy new arena. Reigning NBA Finals MVP Leonard shot 9 for 17 and also dished out nine assists in his second game with L.A. after leading the Toronto Raptors to their first title last season in a six-game finals against the Warriors. ""I thought he started doing it in the second round last year,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""In the first round he was just dominating and then I thought as each round went on he started playmaking more and more, but what he's doing now is on another level."" Stephen Curry scored 23 points but committed eight turnovers and D'Angelo Russell added 20 points in his Golden State debut, but the Warriors got beat up the way they used to do it against the entire NBA -- even giving up a 46-point third quarter. ""They hit us with our typical third quarter type of vibe,"" Curry said. What a dud for the Dubs as they formally opened new Chase Center in San Francisco after 47 years at Oracle Arena in Oakland. Patrick Patterson scored 20 points and Ivica Zubac had 16 points, 10 rebounds and two blocked shots for Los Angeles. In a rematch of the hard-fought first-round playoff series last season won by the Warriors in six games on their way to a fifth straight finals, the Clippers jumped to a 14-0 lead making 5 of their first 6 shots. Golden State started 0 for 6 and missed four 3s. Russell's jumper at 8:23 gave Golden State its first points and he scored the Warriors' initial seven before Curry hit a 3 at 6:42. The Warriors got a scare when they briefly lost Draymond Green at the 9:03 mark of the opening quarter after he injured his right elbow on a screen, and it was sore all night because of a nerve issue. Green returned to the court at the start of the second and wound up with 11 points. Curry, who at 31 is the oldest Warriors player, was 2 of 11 on 3s as new-look Golden State went 15 for 42 from deep. Kevin Durant is long gone and so are several other key veterans part of the recent Warriors championship runs. ""I'm sure the film session tomorrow won't be pretty,"" Curry said. Golden State coach Steve Kerr is embracing the move and new arena -- he's still figuring his way around the building -- but noted ""I'll miss everything about Oracle. It's a great place to play."" Some fans left after the third quarter with the home team trailing 111-87. There will be plenty more lumps along the way for this young group, with Kerr noting, ""This is not a one off."" ""This is more the reality of the NBA. The last five years we've been living in a world that isn't supposed to exist,"" Kerr said. Leonard and Patrick Beverley were booed during pregame introductions for the Clippers, who beat the Lakers 112-102 in their opener Tuesday with Leonard scoring 30 points on 10-for-19 shooting. TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles shot 56.8% in the first half (21 of 37), making 6 of 11 3s. ... The Clippers were outrebounded 23-20 in the first half and 42-39 overall. ... G Rodney McGruder missed his second straight game with a high right ankle sprain. ... The Clippers scored 58 points in the paint. Warriors: Golden State called a late timeout when it had none remaining, resulting in a technical foul. ... Kevon Looney started at center for the Warriors after working back from a strained right hamstring then dealt with right hamstring tightness in the second half and didn't return as a precautionary move. The hope had been he would play about 20 minutes with four stretches of five minutes or so, Kerr said. ... Kerr challenged a foul call on Looney late in the first half and the call was upheld. ... The Warriors had won the last three at home against the Clippers. NICE TOUCHES Newly enshrined Hall of Famer Al Attles, who will be 83 next month, took part in a ceremonial tipoff just before the ball actually went up. Attles joined the organization in 1960 and played in the Philadelphia Warriors in Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game on March 2, 1962. Injured Splash Brother Klay Thompson, who could miss the entire season recovering from surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee, spoke to the fans at midcourt before the game. He also shared a hug and a few words with Leonard. Construction workers who built Chase Center held the flag for the national anthem. LOCKED OUT Kerr joked he might need to wear his key card around his neck even on game nights. ""I've been locked out of my office a couple times after games, true story,"" he said. ""... We're slowly but surely figuring those things out."" QUOTEABLE Rivers hardly considers Curry past his prime beginning his 11th NBA season. ""I want him to get older. I'm all for the 40 Steph, I can't wait for that one,"" Rivers quipped. ""He'll still be playing because he can shoot. He just won't be as agile I don't think. He's been around a long time. It's amazing when you think about it how quickly it goes.""","401160658"
"BOSTON --  Kemba Walker said he wants to earn the role of being a leader with the Celtics this season. He didn't mind following his teammates in Boston's win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night. Walker recovered from a second straight poor shooting start to score 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and help the Celtics rally to beat the defending NBA champions 112-106. Jaylen Brown had 25 points, including a key 3-pointer in the closing minutes. Jayson Tatum finished with 25 points and nine rebounds. Walker said support from his teammates helped him shake off a 0-for-5 start from the field just two days removed from his  4 for 18 performance in Boston's season-opening loss to Philadelphia. ""That's what I needed,"" Walker said. ""The things that they said to me are the things that I needed to hear. They seen my face, kind of down at times. They just kept encouraging me."" The Celtics shot only 38%, but it wasn't for a lack of trying. They had 109 attempts in the game. Pascal Siakam scored 33 points and had eight rebounds to lead the Raptors, who went 18 of 36 from the 3-point line.  Kyle Lowry finished with 29 points, including six 3-pointers.  But the pair also had nine turnovers between them. Siakam said teams are playing him differently through two games. ""There's more help, obviously,"" he said. ""Last year, I felt like I was always out there on the side just working. Now there's a little more intention."" There were 12 ties and 19 lead changes, with neither team holding more than a seven-point lead. Boston found its shot in the fourth quarter, outscoring Toronto 36-24. One of the plays that got the Celtics going came with 5:43 to play. Brown corralled a Marc Gasol miss, took two dribbles and threaded a half-court bounce pass between three Raptors defenders to a cutting Gordon Hayward for a layup to give the Celtics a 99-98 lead. ""I have definitely been working on that side of my game, being a playmaker and making plays for others,"" Brown said. ""Hopefully there will be a lot more passes like that coming soon."" Later, the Celtics were leading 107-106 when Brown hit a 3-pointer with 2:49 to play. O.G. Anunoby was called for a charge on Walker with 1:26 left, which was challenged by the Raptors. But after a review, the call was upheld. Boston got a shot-clock violation on its next trip down the floor, but Lowry turned it over on Toronto's ensuing possession when his one-handed pass along the baseline sailed out of bounds with 45 seconds remaining. The Celtics closed out the final 9:07 of regulation on a 30-17 run. Coming off a 34-point game in Toronto's season-opening win over New Orleans on Tuesday, Siakam also started slow. He missed his first four shots and was scoreless in the first period before he got a finger roll to fall just before halftime. TIP-INS Raptors: Hollis-Jefferson and McCaw (sore right knee) sat for the second straight game, but Nurse said one or both could be ready to go on Saturday. Celtics: Daniel Theis left the game in the second quarter with a sprained left ankle, but returned in the third period. . Enes Kanter (left knee contusion) Tacko Fall (concussion protocol) and Romeo Langford (sore right knee) were both inactive. CHALLENGE Celtics coach Brad Stevens is 1-0 in using the coach's challenge this season. He successfully challenged a foul called on Williams as he contested a 3-point attempt by Gasol from the corner with 0.3 seconds. Replay appeared to show Williams whiff on his contest of Gasol's attempt. The NBA Replay Center agreed, prompting a jump ball. ""Exhilarating,"" Stevens said of winning the challenge. ROTATING BIG MEN Stevens said they will likely have a rotating center spot early throughout this season. Even before Enes Kanter was injured in the opener, he said the expectation was for the center position to often vary by opponent. ""We'll see how we go, night to night, who is the best option to look at,"" Stevens said. Theis started Friday and played 14 minutes. Robert Williams III logged 14 minutes off the bench.","401160659"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Karl-Anthony Towns took advantage of an obvious mismatch Friday night when Charlotte center Cody Zeller wasn't there to defend him. Towns had 37 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, and the Minnesota Timberwolves remained unbeaten with a 121-99 win over the Hornets. Without Zeller, who missed the game due to undisclosed personal reasons, the Hornets were forced to turn to Bismack Biyombo and Willy Hernangomez to defend the two-time All-Star. Towns took full advantage, finishing 13 of 18 from the field while using his big frame create space inside. He also drained four 3-pointers. Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said he wants his team working on a balanced inside-outside attack, but admitted ""the fact that there was not a defender like Cody Zeller on the court tonight -- and obviously our prayers are with him -- we went inside a little more."" Andrew Wiggins added 16 points for Minnesota, which outscored Charlotte 45-25 in the third quarter to break open a two-point game. Towns said he felt like he needed to take control when the Timberwolves fell behind 12-2 after missing 7 of 8 shots to open the game. ""That's where I have to do my job and get people buckets and get us going by drawing a lot of attention and making the right pass,"" Towns said. Said Minnesota guard Josh Okogie: ""This was a regular night for KAT. I definitely know that he can definitely do more, so I'm definitely excited to see what he can do this season."" Saunders said his team's defense fueled the offense in the decisive third quarter. ""We feel confident that even when we're missing shots, we were generating good looks and we just needed some to fall, but really our defense fueled our offense,"" Saunders said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Outrebounded the Hornets 52-42. ... Shabazz Napier had nine assists. Hornets: Rookie PJ Washington, who had 27 points on seven 3s in Charlotte's season opener, had 10 points and 10 rebounds.. ... Nic Batum said he will miss at least three weeks with a broken finger. IMPRESSIVE START Hornets backup guard Devonte Graham continued his torrid start to the season, finishing with a team-high 24 points on 6-of-9 shooting from 3-point range. Graham is shooting 75% (12 of 16) from deep in two games. ""His confidence, he's impressive,"" Saunders said. ""I was telling a few our assistants on the bench that they way he is shooting the ball and the way he is rising up, with that rhythm -- he's definitely got a future."" Graham played nearly 28 minutes, while starting point guard Terry Rozier played just 17. TURNOVER CENTRAL Minnesota turned 20 Charlotte turnovers into 21 points. The Hornets, who played eight players with less than three years of NBA experience, have now turned the ball over 39 times in two games. ""We're gonna get smacked in the mouth a few times, it's how you respond,"" said Hornets coach James Borrego. HONORING THEIR COACH Members of the Timberwolves presented their head coach with a game ball and the assistant coaches gave him a large sheet cake to help honor the memory of his father, Flip Saunders, who died on this day four years ago. ""The motto is `us,' and when someone feels something and is having a moment, we want to be helpful in that moment,"" Towns said. ""We thought it was very important as a team. Me personally, I got our guys understanding how important this game is, four years from the day, we've got to win this for him. We've got to take care of our leader."" Cake was one of Flip Saunders' favorites. ""I know he's smiling,"" Towns said. ""His son's doing really well, a tremendous job.""","401160660"
"NEW YORK --  The Knicks had the momentum on the court and their fans cheering wildly in the stands. The Nets have Kyrie Irving. He's the main reason that for now, all roads -- and bridges and tunnels -- point Brooklyn's way in New York's basketball rivalry. Irving scored 26 points and made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 22 seconds left after the Knicks had taken a late lead, and the Nets held on for a 113-109 victory Friday night in the first meeting this season between New York's teams. ""Having a player like that, where you know that he can make plays down the stretch, it gives the team a lot of confidence,"" Nets forward Joe Harris said. ""I don't think any one of us, when the Knicks got up by three there with a like a minute and a half to go, I don't think any of us were worried."" The Nets controlled much of the game and then responded just in time after the Knicks had surged ahead with a big fourth quarter. Irving, who scored 50 points in an overtime loss in his Brooklyn debut, scored five straight points down the stretch after New York took a three-point lead. Spencer Dinwiddie added 20 points. Allonzo Trier scored 22 points for the Knicks, who fell to 0-2. Rookie RJ Barrett and Kevin Knox II each added 16. Nets fans hoping to see the first victory for their new-look team had to wait through an anxious fourth quarter, when the blue-shirted fans in the building started making plenty of noise after the Knicks came back from 19 points down. Wayne Ellington's 3-pointer capped a run of 10 straight points that tied it at 104. Irving made a layup, but then Ellington hit another 3 and Barrett stole Irving's pass and made a layup, making it a 15-2 run and giving New York a 109-106 lead with 3:41 to play. ""So I just had to bring the guys, tell them to calm down,"" Irving said. ""We just had to get three solid possessions offensively and defensively, and down the stretch I feel like we made some big-time plays."" Irving then hit a jumper and a step-back 3-pointer from the right wing that was reminiscent of his game-winning 3 in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals for Cleveland. ""He's a great player. A champion. Great players make great plays and that's what he did tonight,"" Barrett said. ""Same shot he hit to win the championship against Golden State."" The Knicks had a chance to tie but Julius Randle lost the ball on a spin move under the basket and Dinwiddie closed it out with two free throws. The Nets have been in New York since 2012, but this is the first time they clearly have the bigger share of the city's basketball buzz. Kevin Durant and Irving committed to come to Brooklyn in the opening hours of free agency, and the Knicks weren't able to get an All-Star, even though they had enough salary cap space to sign two of them. The Nets gave away Irving jerseys -- which some people took as an attempt to taunt the Knicks. There was certainly plenty of Brooklyn black inside Barclays Center, which often seems split more evenly and where Knicks fans have made plenty of noise in the past during better times. This time, when the Knicks came out to warm up they were greeted with chants of ""We got Kyrie! We got Kyrie!"" and ""Where is Zion?"" ""Where is Zion?"" -- a reminder that the Knicks didn't make the biggest score in free agency or the draft, where they ended up with the No. 3 pick and missed a chance to draft Zion Williamson. TIP-INS Knicks: Randle was just 5 for 15 and finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. ... Mitchell Robinson started at center after missing the opener with a sprained right ankle. He had six points and seven rebounds. Nets: DeAndre Jordan, who signed along with Durant and Irving, had seven points and 11 rebounds after finishing with just two points and three rebounds in his debut. ... Harris scored 13 points. SECOND-QUARTER SCUFFLE Bobby Portis and Taurean Prince were given second-quarter technical fouls after a brief scrum. Randle leaped to stop a drive by Irving, who landed on the court with the ball in his hands. He refused to let go as Portis tried to rip it out of his hands -- all but lifting Irving off the court in his attempts -- and Prince ran over to pull Portis away from Irving before other players rushed in. BRONX CHEER Aaron Judge and CC Sabathia were in the crowd and both received loud ovations when they were shown on the overhead board. Fans stood and cheered for Sabathia, who injured his shoulder in the American League Championship Series in his final outing before retiring.","401160661"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Zach LaVine may have led Chicago scorers, but it was rookie Coby White who sparked the Bulls' comeback. LaVine had 37 points, and White, the seventh pick in last summer's NBA Draft, scored 21 of his 25 points in the second half as the Bulls rallied to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 110-102 on Friday night. ""I told ya'll from the jump, I knew how good he was going to be,"" LaVine said when asked about White. ""He's going to continue to get better."" Memphis built a first-half lead to 14 points before holding a 60-47 advantage at the break. At that point, White had a mere four points. The North Carolina product's 21 second-half points included 8 of 11 from the field and 4 of 6 from outside the arc. ""It was a team win,"" the rookie said. ""I was just one little piece of it. We got it done as a team. ... I was just doing what I can to create some type of spark."" Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 23 points and 11 rebounds, while rookie Brandon Clarke had 14 points, missing only two of nine shots. Grizziles rookie Ja Morant, the No. 2 pick in the draft, and Jonas Valanciunas added 10 points apiece. Valanciunas grabbed 13 rebounds. The Bulls turned up the defense to start the second half, cutting into the Grizzlies' lead as Memphis missed its first six shots. White would end up playing the entire fourth quarter as the Grizzlies saw their lead slip away. ""I wasn't taking him out,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said of White. The Bulls caught Memphis with about four minutes left on a 3-pointer from White. After the teams exchanged leads, Chicago pulled ahead for good when LaVine scored on a drive with 1:31 left, part of a 12-1 Bulls closing run. The loss marked the second time in the first two games in which Memphis squandered a lead it held entering the fourth quarter -- perhaps a sign of a young team. ""We kind of got away from what we needed to be doing offensively in the third quarter,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""We have to learn from how the first half is more indicative of what we have to be offensively and defensively. Then we have to get better in the third and fourth quarter."" TIP-INS Bulls: Have won five straight in the series -- the longest victory stretch over the Grizzlies since Chicago won the first seven games after the franchise started in Vancouver. ... Lauri Markkanen made only one of eight shots in the first half, including missing six from outside the arc. He finished 4 of 15 from the field, scoring nine points. ... White scored 10 points in the third quarter to start the Bulls' comeback. Grizzlies: Play five of their next six games at home. The lone road game is at Los Angeles against the Lakers next Tuesday. ... The loss snapped a streak of three straight home-opening wins. ... An indication of the new faces on the Grizzlies, swingman Dillon Brooks is the longest-tenured Memphis player entering his third year. ... Valanciunas earned the Grizzlies first home technical of the year, debating a no-call in the second quarter. ... Morant, who had six turnovers in the season-opening loss to Miami, committed four against the Bulls. He has nine assists to 10 turnovers in his first two games. MANAGING OTTO Before the game, Chicago coach Jim Boylen indicated forward Otto Porter Jr. would play less than 24 minutes as the Bulls manage his time. Chicago plays their first back-to-back of the season on Saturday against Toronto. ""We'll manger him appropriately to play (Saturday), and then we will evaluate him after the game if he does play (against Toronto),"" Boylen said. Porter played just more than 21 minutes.

"NEW ORLEANS --  As he watched his late, rainbow 3-pointer drop in off the glass, Luka Doncic skipped backward toward the defensive end for the Dallas Mavericks with a snarl on his face and clenched fists lowered near each hip. ""He makes those shots. He's wild,"" teammate Kristaps Porzingis said. ""At the end of the game, he was really clutch."" Doncic highlighted his triple-double by scoring eight of his 25 points in the final five minutes, and the Mavericks topped New Orleans 123-116 in the Pelicans' home opener Friday night. Doncic also had 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while Porzingis added 24 points and five blocks to help Dallas start 2-0 for the first time since the 2004-05 season. ""Everybody's happy after this win, but it's just the start,"" Doncic said, adding he wants to see the Mavs in the playoff hunt come April. ""We've got to keep it going."" Delon Wright scored 18 points, effectively finding close-range shots with decisive cuts and drives to the hoop, and highlighted a strong defensive outing with a late steal. ""He played an amazing game,"" Doncic said. ""He was the key to our win."" Brandon Ingram led New Orleans with 25 points after scoring 22 in a loss at defending NBA champion Toronto in overtime to open the season Tuesday night. The game was tied at 109 after Ingram's jumper with about five minutes left, but Doncic responded with a jumper while being fouled by Jrue Holiday to start a six-point mini-run capped by Jalen Brunson's turnaround near the baseline that made it 115-109. New Orleans missed five straight 3-pointers before Ingram finally hit one to make it 115-112. Doncic's right-handed runner in the lane over a crowd of defenders, followed by his left wing 3 off the glass with 1:23 left, made it 120-113, and the Pelicans couldn't recover. ""That's him,"" Porzingis said of Doncic. ""He loves those moments. I love those moments. And we're going to try to be dangerous there at the end."" Derrick Favors and Josh Hart each had 16 points for the Pelicans. Lonzo Ball added 15. Holiday, however, labored through an uncharacteristically rough shooting night, going just 2 of 11 from the field. ""I feel like we go through this every year, especially with me, but it's just timing -- new lineups, new situations, new team,"" Holiday said. ""There's always a positive. Last two games, we were in it at the end, so we'll just go back to the film and see what we can do."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Brunson finished with 14 points and Maxi Kleber grabbed 10 rebounds. ... Dwight Powell, who plays center and forward, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. ... Coach Rick Carlisle lost a replay challenge of an officials' decision that Wright committed a blocking foul on Hart's fourth-quarter pull-up that cut the Mavs' lead to 103-101. ... Dallas went 14 of 40 from 3-point range but shot 48.4 percent (45 of 93) overall. Pelicans: Reserve guard Frank Jackson scored 10 points in just 14:47. ... New Orleans finished 15 of 41 from 3-point range, with Ball missing nine of 12 and Hart missing four of five. ... Coach Alvin Gentry rotated 11 players into the game and 10 of them played at least 14 minutes. In New Orleans' opener at Toronto, 12 players got in the game, each playing at least 13 minutes. SECOND-QUARTER SURGE New Orleans led by 16 early and double digits for much of the first half. The Pelicans went up 53-40 on Nickeil Alexander-Walker's 3 in the second quarter, but Dallas outscored New Orleans 32-11 during the final eight minutes of the half, and Porzingis said it started with Dallas' defense. ""I told everybody we're going to step it up. We're going to put it in a different gear defensively,"" Porzingis said. ""We got out there with more energy, with more intensity, more vocal. ... That got us going."" Wright and Doncic each scored eight during that surge, which was ignited by Doncic's step-back 3. Soon after, Porzingis, who had 17 first-half points, added a dunk, a 3 and free throws on successive possessions to make it 55-50. Tim Hardaway Jr.'s 3 put Dallas ahead 72-64 at halftime. DELAYED DEBUT Top draft pick Zion Williamson, coming off arthroscopic surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee, was on the court for introductions in street clothes, using a crutch. He is expected to be out six to eight weeks, meaning the Pelicans could be 20-plus games into the season before he plays.","401160663"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The crowd was fired up after Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's jumper capped a rally and tied it in the closing minutes against the Washington Wizards. The new-look Oklahoma City Thunder, in their first home game since trading away All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George in the offseason, seemed prepared to give their fans some hope. The Wizards, unfazed, responded with a 14-0 run and beat Oklahoma City 97-85 on Friday night. ""I told the guys that's why the fans are going to fall in love with our team -- because we give a lot of incredible effort,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""I mean, it's maximum effort every time on the court, and some of the time, you don't know what's going to happen."" Thomas Bryant had 21 points and 11 rebounds, rookie forward Rui Hachimura scored 19 points and Bradley Beal added 17 for Washington. Oklahoma City shot just under 40 percent, made just 14 of 22 free throws and had 19 turnovers. Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 28 points and Danilo Gallinari added 18 for the Thunder. Point guard Chris Paul, who scored six points in 30 minutes and had four assists and five turnovers, blamed himself for the loss. ""If I would have contributed at all we would have won the game, and that's something, and you can't sugar coat it,"" he said. The Wizards led 52-46 at halftime, then scored the first six points of the second half. The Wizards led 78-70 at the end of the third quarter. The Thunder held the Wizards scoreless for the first 4 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter to tighten the game. Gilgeous-Alexander's mid-range jumper tied it at 83 with 4:26 to play. Washington responded quickly. A 3-pointer by Davis Bertans put the Wizards up by five, and a layup by Beal forced a Thunder timeout. The Thunder made just one more basket the rest of the way, and that came with 20.9 seconds remaining. Brooks said Washington is improving because the team's young players have the right attitude. ""It's hard to teach when you have students who aren't interested in learning,"" Brooks said. ""I love the group that we have. We want to get better, and that's a coach's dream."" TIP-INS Wizards: G Jordan McRae sat out with a finger injury. He played 23 minutes in the opener against Dallas. ... Ish Smith, who had a short stint with the Thunder, started the game and finished with four points and five assists. ... Beal made 4 of 17 shots the first three quarters but 3 of 5 in the fourth.

He's averaging 12.5 rebounds, but his offensive struggles have hurt a team that has been in two close games to start the season. QUOTABLE Adams, talking about a Thunder team that has three new starters since last season: ""Just chemistry, mate. Just chemistry, get a bit more flow. It's just constantly building. This stuff ain't easy."" Paul took a different approach. ""It's the NBA, we are all pros,"" he said. ""You can't be taking time and losing games.""","401160664"
"DENVER --  This was Jamal Murray's overriding emotion after watching his teammate block a last-second shot to preserve the win, after seeing another teammate called for a foul on a half-court shot to send the game into overtime and after his clutch baskets in the closing moments: ""Tired,"" the point guard said. A fitting feeling following such a crazy contest. Murray scored seven of his 27 points in OT and the Denver Nuggets regrouped to beat the Phoenix Suns 108-107 in their home opener Friday night after Ricky Rubio tied the game late in regulation when he was fouled on a half-court shot. ""It was definitely a game of different emotions,"" Torrey Craig said. The final emotion? Relief. Murray hit two free throws with 19.4 seconds remaining in overtime to give the Nuggets the lead. Devin Booker took a last-second shot for Phoenix, but Craig glided over from the opposite side to get a hand on the jumper. ""Sometimes you need games like that,"" said Craig, who had four blocked shots. ""You can learn from it."" Nikola Jokic finished with 23 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists to help the Nuggets escape after leading by nine with 3:10 remaining in the fourth. Rubio extended the game in improbable fashion when he dribbled up the court and launched a 3-pointer as Malik Beasley grabbed his arm with 1.8 seconds remaining in regulation. He made all three free throws. ""Just an immature play by me. I've got to learn time and score,"" Beasley said. ""We still pulled it out and still made great plays."" In overtime, Murray took control. His game-winning free throws came soon after Gary Harris swatted the ball away from Frank Kaminsky down low. Rubio, Aron Baynes and Kelly Oubre Jr. all fouled out in OT. Oubre led the team with 23 points. ""We fought hard all night,"" Booker said. ""Couple of things we need to clean up on, but we faced adversity tonight and we responded well to it."" Especially at the line, where the Suns went a combined 31 of 32. Kaminsky was 11 of 11, Rubio 7 of 7 and Oubre 6 of 6. ""If we keep playing like that it's going to be a good season,"" Rubio said. Before Beasley's unnecessary foul, he was having quite a fourth quarter -- scoring eight straight points for Denver during a critical stretch. Jerami Grant also came up big in the fourth with a crowd-energizing, one-handed dunk off a missed 3-pointer. The Nuggets have improved in each season under coach Michael Malone, going from 33 wins his first season to 40, 46 and 54 last season when the team earned the No. 2 overall seed in the West. A big reason for their success was an NBA-best 34-7 mark at home in 2018-19. Malone has challenged them to improve that record. ""Let's hold ourselves to an even higher standard,"" he said. Suns big man Deandre Ayton missed the first of 25 games after being suspended Thursday for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program after testing positive for a diuretic. Baynes had 15 points in place of the second-year center. ""We know things are going to happen, so when your name's called up you've got to perform,"" Rubio said. TIP-INS Suns: F Cameron Johnson missed a second straight game with left calf soreness. ""He's close,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ... Kaminsky had 19 points and 11 boards. Nuggets: Denver had 12 blocked shots. ... Denver was misfiring from long range all game after making 18 3-pointers in a season-opening win at Portland. The team was 7 of 27 against Phoenix.  ... Trailing by as many as 14 points, the Nuggets took their first lead of the game, 57-55, on Jokic's three-point play at 4:16 of the third quarter. LOCAL AIRING Altitude TV purchased air time with a local station to broadcast the Nuggets home opener. Altitude Sports remains in negotiation with three former Altitude cable and satellite carriers -- Comcast, DIRECTV and DISH Network. The companies have dropped Altitude from its lineups. Altitude also broadcasts the Colorado Avalanche. TIGHT RELATIONSHIP Williams holds Malone in high esteem. The feeling is mutual. Malone was a member of Williams' staff in 2010-11 when Williams was the head coach in New Orleans. Malone remembers an important lesson Williams imparted -- family first. ""He was kicking me out of office, telling me to go home,"" Malone recalled. ""He understood the importance of family.""","401160665"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  As he watched Damian Lillard take over in the fourth quarter, Hassan Whiteside stood up from his spot on Portland's bench and began pointing to his wrist. Having seen Lillard repeatedly burn teams with late shots while playing against him, Whiteside knew his new teammate was ready to do it once again. Lillard scored 13 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter and the Trail Blazers pulled away to beat the Sacramento Kings 122-112 on Friday night. ""I knew what time it was,"" Whiteside said. ""I think everybody knew what time it was."" Lillard added five assists and five rebounds, Whiteside had 22 points and nine rebounds despite sitting out the entire fourth period, and C.J. McCollum scored 19. ""In the first half we didn't think we played well at all,"" Lillard said. ""We were able to come out and assert ourselves starting the third quarter and pretty much controlled the game through the finish."" Portland (1-1) overcame a sluggish first half but couldn't shake Sacramento until Lillard took over midway through the fourth. The All-Star point guard weaved through the Kings defense for an uncontested layup, then nailed back-to-back 3-pointers, including one from 31 feet, and a pair of free throws to make it 114-101. Hield hit a 3-pointer for the Kings but McCollum scored on consecutive trips down the floor and Lillard added his third 3 of the quarter. It was nothing new to Whiteside. He's seen it all before from both Lillard and McCollum. The only difference now is Whiteside's vantage point. ""That's part of the reason I was so excited coming here,"" Whiteside said. ""I knew what it was. I've guarded it. Being out there with those guys means a lot."" Blazers coach Terry Stotts credited his team's defense for making the difference. ""That was a really challenging game,"" Stotts said. ""Sacramento plays a style that's really tough to guard. We made most of our runs when we defended well."" De'Aaron Fox had 28 points, five assists and six rebounds for Sacramento. Buddy Hield added 21 points but the Kings remained winless in two games under new coach Luke Walton. ""We need to be able to get stops, and tonight we were not able to,"" Walton said. ""I actually thought we had some nice strides toward the end of the preseason with our defense but it has unfortunately not carried over into the regular season."" Anfernee Simons added 15 points off the bench for Portland. Sacramento controlled most of the first half and led by seven late in the second quarter before Portland closed on a 12-5 run. McCollum fueled the surge with a steal, dunk and short floater, and Lillard made a step-back 22-footer over Fox to tie it at 57. RESTING HASSAN Stotts rested Whiteside in the fourth quarter after the big man logged 26 minutes in the first three periods. Whiteside also played 26 minutes in the opener against Denver. It helped that Sacramento's two centers, Dewayne Dedmon and Richaun Holmes, were in foul trouble, forcing the Kings to go with a smaller lineup. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard picked up two fouls in a five-second span early in the first quarter. ... Simons scored 10 points in the second quarter after being held to five on 2-of-7 shooting in the season-opening loss to Denver. Kings: Marvin Bagley III, who broke his right thumb in the opening loss at Phoenix, did not play and is expected to miss four-to-six weeks. Harry Giles (left knee soreness) also was held out. WEBBER, WALTON ON HAND Chris Webber attended the game and sat courtside next to Kings owner Vivek Ranadive. Webber, a four-time All-Star with Sacramento and one of the most popular players in franchise history, was greeted with a loud ovation from the Golden 1 Center crowd. Former Blazers star Bill Walton, the father of Sacramento's coach, was also in attendance wearing a purple Kings shirt.","401160666"
"LOS ANGELES --  Less than 90 seconds into the game, Anthony Davis leaped and slammed home an alley-oop pass from LeBron James for the first points of his home debut with the Los Angeles Lakers. By the final 90 seconds, Davis and James were enjoying a blowout win from the bench. It's only a start, but it's exactly what the Lakers had in mind when these two superstars elected to team up in Hollywood. Davis had 21 points and seven rebounds in his first home game with the Lakers, and James delivered 32 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds Friday night during Los Angeles' 95-86 victory over the Utah Jazz. Troy Daniels hit four 3-pointers and scored 15 points for the Lakers, who were impressive in unveiling their revamped lineup. Along with the offensive fireworks expected from a team boasting Davis and James, Los Angeles forced 23 turnovers by a talented Utah squad and won comfortably behind that gritty defense. ""We are the real deal defensively,"" Davis said. ""We try to lay our hats on defense. We want to be a defensive-oriented team, and guys came in and were pesky today."" Davis had already played in a regular-season game at Staples Center in a Lakers uniform while getting wildly cheered -- but that happened three days earlier during the Lakers' loss in the Clippers' home opener. The star big man is still looking for his flow, but he blocked five shots and contributed steadily on offense. James was aggressive throughout the final three quarters, bulling his way to the hoop and sliding away from defenders in another impressive two-way game. ""He was just locked in and had a really good night in both halves, but particularly in the second half,"" Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points for the Jazz, who played without injured newcomer Bojan Bogdanovic. Utah has committed 34 turnovers in its first two games. Jeff Green had five points while starting in place of Bogdanovic, Utah's $73 million free agent acquisition. The Jazz beat Oklahoma City in their opener, but didn't have enough offense to compete with the new-look Lakers and their solid defensive schemes. ""We were talking about our offense all preseason and how it was good, and our defense was bad,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Now our offense hasn't been good. ... There's a part of it that you're getting connected and things like that, but there's also part of it where we just need to be stronger with the ball. We need to be more decisive. We need to be more precise."" The Lakers never trailed after the opening minutes, and they took firm control with a strong third quarter featuring 12 points from James and three 3-pointers from Daniels, the proficient outside shooter acquired specifically to knock down spot-up 3s. Los Angeles opened the third quarter with a small lineup using Davis as its center to minimize the defensive impact of Utah big man Rudy Gobert, and it worked splendidly. ""You've got to give credit to the Lakers, too,"" said Mike Conley, who had 13 points on 3-of-11 shooting. ""They defended us the way they wanted to, but a lot of it is us learning each other. Us learning guys. Who's handling the ball? Who's running? Who's in different lanes?"" DWIGHT RETURNS Dwight Howard heard a few boos when he checked in for his first home game back with the Lakers, whom he spurned in free agency in 2013 after one tumultuous season. He had been booed relentlessly for six years since -- but in his return as Los Angeles' backup center, Howard played a strong defensive game and earned cheers by the second half with his obvious effort. DANNY SPEAKS Danny Green had nine points after scoring 28 against the Clippers in his Lakers debut earlier this week. The veteran who won a ring with Toronto last season also took the microphone before the game and told cheering fans: ""I promise we'll do better than last year."" TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic sat out after rolling his left ankle in Utah's season opener Wednesday. He returned in the second half of that win over Oklahoma City, scoring nine of his 16 points on a bad ankle. ... Joe Ingles started and scored just two points after Royce O'Neale started the opener. Lakers: G Rajon Rondo missed his second straight game with a sore right calf. He will return soon, and F Kyle Kuzma will be right behind him. Kuzma didn't participate in training camp while recovering from a left ankle injury incurred during the summer, but he is participating in 4-on-4 drills and other activities.","401160667"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks had a 21-point lead in the third quarter at home and lost. That's not what good teams do, and Giannis Antetokounmpo knows it. Goran Dragic scored 25 points off the bench, Bam Adebayo added 19 points and 13 rebounds, and the Miami Heat rallied to beat Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in overtime 131-126 on Saturday night. Antetokounmpo finished with 29 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists, but last season's MVP also had eight turnovers and fouled out with 2:31 to play in overtime. Antetokounmpo also fouled out Thursday night in Houston. ""Obviously, we've got to learn from tonight's game,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We were up 21 and we allowed them to come back into the game. We cannot let that happen. Good teams don't let that happen. Definitely, we're going to learn from this."" After trailing 74-53 with less than 11:00 to play in the third quarter, the Heat outscored Milwaukee 78-52 the rest of the way, including 49-33 in the fourth quarter and overtime. ""A tremendous amount of perseverance and guts,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. ""Our guys made some really big-time plays in the second half. Our level of intensity, urgency went up. If you are going to try to beat one of these teams on their home floor, you are going to have to play a lot harder than we did in the first half. It was one inspiring play after another."" Duncan Robinson hit a 3-pointer for the Heat to tie the game at 105 with 7:00 to play in regulation. Dragic then added a pair of free throws to give Miami its first lead since 2-0. Kelly Olynyk, who had 14 points off the bench, hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put the Heat ahead 113-107 with 4:52 to play. With Miami up 121-119 with 3 seconds to go in regulation, Khris Middleton shot an air ball and Antetokounmpo tipped it in at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. Adebayo sank four free throws in the extra period and Dragic scored six points in overtime to lift Miami to its second win. ""We were down and we never quit,"" Dragic said. ""We fought back. We could make our job a little bit easier if we hit all those free throws. But in the end, a great comeback. When Giannis hit that layup (at the horn), a lot of teams in this league would just quit and we didn't. I'm proud of the guys."" Kendrick Nun scored 18 points before fouling out for the Heat, who had seven players score in double figures. Justise Winslow had 10 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, and Miami rookie Tyler Herro, a Milwaukee native, finished with 14. ""I didn't really know what to expect, but I was happy to hear the crowd cheer for me,"" Herro said. Middleton added 25 points for the Bucks. Heat guard Jimmy Butler missed his second straight game after he and his girlfriend welcomed a baby on Wednesday. The Bucks hit 14 3-pointers in the first half -- the most the Heat have ever allowed in a first half -- en route to building a 70-53 lead at halftime. Milwaukee finished 17-for-54 from beyond the arc. ""Sometimes you're going to go 2-for-24 but if you don't allow 39 points in the fourth quarter, you probably have a decent chance to be on the other side of the score,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""The offense definitely needs to be better, but 39 is the number that stands out to me. TIP-INS Heat: Derrick Jones left the game with a left groin strain. Bucks: Antetokounmpo came one assist shy of becoming the fourth player in NBA history to record a triple-double in consecutive games to start a season (Magic Johnson in 1981 and '82, Jerry Lucas in '72 and Oscar Robertson in '61).","401160668"
"DETROIT --  The Philadelphia 76ers are expected to be one of the NBA's top teams this season. Saturday night, they lived up to those expectations with their best player was in street clothes. With Joel Embiid sidelined with an ankle injury, the 76ers still had too much height and speed for the Detroit Pistons, beating them 117-111. Tobias Harris scored 29 points against his former team, Al Horford added 23 and Mike Scott had 17 as a reserve. Of their 69 points, 33 came on 11-of-19 3-point shooting. ""They are really tough to guard because they've got so many big guys who can pop out and knock down a 3-pointer,"" Pistons center Christian Wood said. Harris said the Sixers won by sticking to their game plan despite Embiid's absence. ""We were playing defense, moving the call and creating shots,"" he said. ""I had a lot of great looks because we would get a stop at one end and we would get down the floor and create something off the run."" Philadelphia had 30 assists to Detroit's 20 and held one of the league's best offensive-rebounding teams to five in 37 attempts. ""We've got a lot of new parts and we're still learning each other, but we kept battling tonight,"" said Ben Simmons, who had 13 points and 10 assists. ""That was huge."" The Pistons also weren't at full strength, either. Blake Griffin's season won't start for Detroit until November because of knee and hamstring soreness and Reggie Jackson missed the game with a back injury. Detroit led by 13 points in the third quarter, but Drummond came out of the game with his fourth foul, leaving Dwane Casey to improvise a lineup that also couldn't include leading scorer Derrick Rose. Philadelphia cut the lead to one in less than four minutes. ""A stretch without Blake, Reggie, Andre and Derrick is going to be tough,"" he said. ""We're asking guys to play together who have never been on the floor as a group with the game on the line."" Rose led Detroit with 31 points in 27 minutes, but his history of injuries doesn't allow Casey to use him as much as he'd like. ""Believe me, I would love to have him out there for 40 minutes a night, but he just can't do it,"" Casey said. The Pistons turned the ball over 23 times, leading to 31 Philadelphia points, and missed 15 free throws in a game that was close until the closing moments. Drummond had 13 points and 12 rebounds, but only three came on the offensive end, and he was 3-of-10 from the line. ""You can't make 21 free throws out of 36 and turn the ball over 23 times against a great team,"" Casey said. Drummond had a chance to tie it in the final five minutes, but Kyle O'Quinn blocked his layup and Simmons scored at the other end before Drummond got off the floor. That gave the 76ers a 101-97 lead with 4:37 to play and forced coach Dwane Casey into a timeout. After a Pistons miss, Horford hit a 3-pointer, then made it 107-97 with a three-point play after a Detroit turnover. Horford added two more baskets as the Sixers closed out the game. TIP INS 76ers: Horford scored 15 points in the first 10 minutes of the third quarter. ... Harris, a fan favorite during his time in Detroit, playfully waved to the crowd after one of his 3-pointers. Pistons: Casey challenged a second-quarter foul on Drummond. The call was upheld, costing Detroit a timeout. ... Markieff Morris had 14 points and Luke Kennard combined for 26 points in the first half, but only seven in the second half. WOOD LOOKING FOR PLAYING TIME Pistons center Christian Wood played four minutes in the season opener and didn't get on the floor Thursday against Atlanta, so he wanted to make the most of his 19 minutes on Saturday. With Griffin out and Drummond in foul trouble, Wood had 11 points and five rebounds. ""I'm trying to show that I deserve to be in the rotation,"" he said. ""I want the coaches to know I can guard someone like Ben Simmons or Mike Scott in a key situation.""","401160669"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young wants the ball when the game is on the line. He knows he's expected to be Atlanta's big-time player. Young scored 39 points, including Atlanta's last eight, to continue his hot start and the Hawks beat the Orlando Magic 103-99 on Saturday night. When asked how he flourished in the final minutes, Young said: ""That's what makes big-time players what they are. They step up in big moments."" Young, who had 38 points in Atlanta's season-opening win at Detroit, again carried the scoring burden for the Hawks. Atlanta had no other player with more than 10 points. The second-year point guard added nine assists and seven rebounds. Young took over the game after Orlando led 96-95. His baseline reverse layup gave the Hawk the lead. Following a tying free throw by Aaron Gordon, Young's layup again gave the lead back to the Hawks. Young added a long, fallaway 3-pointer, stretching the advantage to 102-97 with 25 seconds remaining. He celebrated with a shimmy strut toward the other end of the court. ""He's clutch, man,"" Hawks forward John Collins said. ""He just has that clutch gene. Guys like him take the shots down the stretch and just expect them to go in."" The Magic couldn't find a way to stop Young. ""I tried to stay in front and make him shoot over top of me,"" said Markelle Fultz. ""He shot it. Just got to slap him on the butt and say, `Good shot."" Young's 38 points against Detroit were the most in a season opener since Dominique Wilkins' 39 against the Nets in 1986. Young led NBA rookies with nine 30-point games last season, and now he already has two. ""Whatever it takes,"" Young said. ""I'm just glad we're winning."" In a matchup of 21-year-old point guards, Young had 17 first-half points. Fultz finished with 12 points. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 23 points. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 10 rebounds. D.J. Augustin had 14. While Young sank 5 of 10 3-pointers, Orlando made only 5 of 31. ""You can't win an NBA game shooting 17% from the 3,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. The actual figure was 16.1%. ""We're all pros,"" Gordon said. ""We got to make those shots."" The Hawks' 9-2 run to open the second half included Young's back-to-back trademark one-handed floaters. He added a steal of Gordon's pass and a 3-pointer for a 61-52 lead -- Atlanta's biggest of the game. Atlanta led 85-84 before Augustin's four free throws and Michael Carter-Williams' powerful jam gave Orlando a 90-85 advantage. Atlanta twice pulled even on shots by Young. His long 3-pointer tied the game at 90, and his jumper knotted the score at 94-all. Jabari Parker and Kevin Huerter each had 10 points for Atlanta. YOUTH IS SERVED The Hawks' youth doesn't end with Young. Atlanta's other starters were 20-year-old Cam Reddish, 21-year-old De'Andre Hunter, 22-year-old Collins and 26-year-old Alex Len. Reddish and Hunter, the team's first-round draft picks, each had six points. Collins had nine points and a game-high 12 rebounds. FREE FOR ALL The Hawks overcame a lopsided disadvantage at the free-throw line. The Magic made 24 of 26 free throws. The Hawks were only 8 of 15 from the line. TIP-INS Magic:  Orlando opened a string of five games in eight days. The stretch ends with home games against the Knicks, Milwaukee and Denver next week. Hawks: Rookie F Bruno Fernando left the game in the third period with a right ankle sprain. He was helped off the court. ... Huerter, who missed all five preseason games with right knee soreness, saw his playing time expand. He was limited to 15 minutes in the opener at Detroit and had 10 points and four assists in 20 minutes.","401160670"
"NEW YORK --  With so much new for Kemba Walker this season, it sure helped to have some familiar feelings. Once he finished with another big night at Madison Square Garden, it was Tacko time. Walker scored a season-high 32 points, snapping out of an early season shooting slump with seven 3-pointers, and the Boston Celtics beat the winless New York Knicks 118-95 on Saturday night. Walker began his Celtics career by going 4 for 18 in an opening loss to Philadelphia, and even with a strong finish against the Raptors was only 8 for 22. But the New York native and former UConn star thrived again at Madison Square Garden, going 11 for 17 overall and 7 for 12 behind the arc. ""It's great energy in here,"" Walker said. ""I'm from here, I've been playing here since I was in high school, so it's just always good to come back."" Jaylen Brown added 19 points for the Celtics, who won their second straight after beating NBA champion Toronto on Friday. Jayson Tatum had 15 points and nine rebounds, and Boston broke open a close game so thoroughly in the fourth quarter that 7-foot-5 rookie Tacko Fall was able to make his NBA debut, scoring four points on a pair of loudly cheered dunks that required barely any jumping. ""It was unbelievable,"" Fall said. ""All throughout the game I didn't know it was going to happen. Once the score kept going up, I was thinking in my mind this might be go time."" Rookie RJ Barrett scored 26 points for the Knicks, who were outscored 72-44 after halftime in their home opener and fell to 0-3. Mitchell Robinson added 17. ""That was an embarrassing second half,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. New York raced to an early lead and trailed only by six after three, but the Celtics scored the first eight points of the final period to make it 90-76. The Celtics then put it away with a 19-4 surge, featuring three straight baskets by Walker, to expand it to 109-85. ""It's a new team, new situation for me,"" said Walker, who had played his entire career in Charlotte. ""But tonight in the second half, yeah, I felt great."" The Celtics had a six-point lead with 5 minutes remaining in the half, but the Knicks outscored them 16-5 the rest of the way to bring a 51-46 advantage with them into the locker room. TIP-INS Celtics: The Celtics were short-handed at center, where Daniel Theis didn't travel because of a sprained left ankle, joining Enes Kanter (bruised left knee) on the inactive list. ""So we're slowly working our way towards 5-less, but we've got a few more left,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Boston did have Fall active for the first time after missing the first two games while in concussion protocol. Knicks: The Knicks have lost four straight at home to the Celtics. ... Julius Randle had 10 points and 10 rebounds but struggled again with his shot, going 4 for 11. NO HOMECOMING Walker moved quickly to join the Celtics in free agency even though the Knicks had a need at point guard and the money to pay him. He understands why some players wouldn't want to play at home, but that wasn't why he made his choice. ""I think it can be a distraction just because you obviously grew up there and you know so many people, but that wasn't the case for me,"" Walker said. ""It wasn't even about that. It was more about the fit, style of play, things of that nature. Like I said, I just thought that Boston was the best fit and opportunity for me."" STRUGGLING SMITH Dennis Smith Jr. continues to struggle after being sidelined with a back injury during preseason. A night after going 0 for 4 in 4  1/2 minutes in Brooklyn, the point guard was 0 for 3. Fans booed during his last stint and then began a chant of ""We want Frank! We want Frank!"" But fellow point guard Frank Ntilikina didn't come back in, playing only 1 minute. ""All we got is us in this locker room,"" Smith said. ""That's what we got to focus on.""","401160671"
"CLEVELAND --  John Beilein was soaked from his shirt to his socks after an unexpected shower. Cleveland's rookie coach had his pro basketball baptism. Beilein picked up his first NBA win and got doused with water in the locker room by Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and the rest of the Cavaliers, who played the kind of ball their rookie coach has been preaching for weeks in a 110-99 win over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. Thompson scored 25 points and made his first career 3-pointer and Love scored 21 and just missed a triple-double as the Cavs opened their 50th season at home with a solid win over a playoff team from last year. Following the game, Beilein presented with the game ball by general manager Koby Altman before he was ambushed by the Cavs, who jumped from their seats and dumped water bottles over his head. ""Excuse my appearance,"" the former Michigan coach said as he sat down for his news conference. ""I just took a little bath."" Beilein, who won at every level in college, said he'll savor the memento from his first pro victory. ""I'm very fortunate to have a lot of game balls, but this one is going to be pretty special,"" the 66-year-old said. ""It's an NBA ball No. 1, but anytime you change jobs like this it's a very difficult time on your family, on you and everyone -- it's such a transition. It will be special."" Cavs forward Larry Nance was thrilled for Beilein. ""It was awesome just to see him breathe a nice sigh of relief,"" he said. ""There was a lot of pressure on us, especially the home opener so for him to get this win. First win for a lot of the guys -- all the rookies. The Cavs began their golden anniversary by honoring the club's past. They brought back some of their legendary players and wore uniforms from the 1990s while taking a look back their history. The present looked more promising. Love was much more involved than during an opening-night loss at Orlando on Wednesday, adding 13 rebounds and nine assists. Thompson also had 13 rebounds, Collin Sexton scored 18 and rookie Darius Garland 12, making a key, step-back 3-pointer down the stretch to slow Indiana's comeback. Malcolm Brogdon scored 30 and had 10 assists to lead the Pacers. The Cavs blitzed the Pacers to open second quarter, going on a 26-4 run. They made seven 3-pointers and outscored Indiana 39-20 in the period to open a 65-48 halftime lead. ""They pretty much did whatever they wanted,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Giving up 39 points, you just can't have quarters like that. They were the more aggressive team, the scrappier team."" It was Thompson's stunning 3-pointer in the first quarter that got the Cavs going. Thompson, who has been working on his range in practice, hadn't attempted a 3 since the 2016-17 season, when he pulled up and dropped a 27-footer -- his first make from beyond the arc in 642 games. ""No way,"" Beilein said with a smile when asked if Thompson will have the green light going forward.

He's been scrimmaging, but hasn't been cleared to play in full-court workouts. ... G Jeremy Lamb sat out with a bruised right hip sustained in the season-opening loss to Detroit on Wednesday.

McLEOD HONORED Love wore a neck tie while warming up before the game to pay tribute to Fred McLeod, the club's popular broadcaster who died unexpectedly in September. McLeod's widow, Beth, sent ties from her husband's collection to select players, coaches and media members to wear for the opener. The Cavs showed a moving video during the first quarter with highlights from McLeod, who handled play-by-play duties for the Detroit Pistons before coming to the Cavs in 2006.

"CHICAGO --  Pascal Siakam is trying to adjust to the attention opponents are giving him now that Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green are no longer around in Toronto. The fourth-year power forward is certainly providing offense. He just needs to cut back on the turnovers. Siakam scored 19 points, OG Anunoby added 17 and the Raptors spoiled Chicago's home opener by beating the Bulls 108-84 on Saturday night. The defending NBA champions went on a run in the second quarter to take a 48-40 halftime lead and pulled away for their 10th straight win over the cold-shooting Bulls. Siakam is giving the Raptors the scoring they need, averaging 28.7 points through three games. But he got called for five fouls and committed four turnovers against Chicago, bringing his team-leading total to 13. ""I can always argue if it was a foul, wasn't a foul. But as a leader, I have to be able to not be in those situations -- and be in the game,"" said Siakam, the NBA's Most Improved Player last season. ""I've got to figure that out. Turnovers, obviously, it's something new for me seeing double teams. I've got to find a way to not turn the ball over."" Anunoby hit three 3-pointers, and Serge Ibaka added 18 points and seven rebounds. Fred VanVleet scored 16 as the Raptors shook off a loss Friday in Boston. The Bulls see themselves as playoff contenders coming off a 22-60 season that ranked among the worst in franchise history. But they hardly looked the part, shooting just 30.2% overall and 9 of 35 on 3s. ""They brought the physicality to us and they threw the first punch,"" Otto Porter Jr. said. ""We didn't really respond well."" Wendell Carter Jr. led Chicago with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Zach LaVine scored 11 after averaging 26.5 over the first two games. Lauri Markkanen struggled again, finishing with nine points for the second straight night. The 7-footer from Finland shot 3 of 10 after going 4 for 15 in a loss at Memphis. PORTER HURT It didn't help Chicago that Porter missed most of the second quarter after taking what appeared to be an inadvertent elbow to the face while drawing a charge against Stanley Johnson. Porter spent several minutes lying face down as blood poured out, leaving a puddle on the court. He went straight to the locker room with the team's medical staff to get six stitches in the left corner of his mouth and returned to start the second half. By then, the Raptors led by eight after outscoring Chicago 17-4 over the final 6 1/2 minutes of the second quarter. PULLING AWAY Marc Gasol and Kyle Lowry hit consecutive 3s in the third. Anunoby added another from beyond the arc to bump it to 62-46 with 7:47 left in the quarter, and the Raptors remained in control the rest of the way. ""That's what we need (Anunoby) to do,"" VanVleet said. ""The way he played tonight, if he plays like that we'll be a tough team to deal with."" QUOTABLE ""Most likely, yeah."" -- Porter, when asked after the game if he was sore. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto outrebounded Chicago 59-45. ... Raptors coach Nick Nurse might have to pay more attention to the Angels now that Joe Maddon is managing Los Angeles and not his beloved Cubs. ""It's a tough one for me,"" said Nurse, a big Cubs fan growing up in Iowa. ""Always loved the Cubs. Joe and I have become friends the last couple years. I certainly will become a much bigger Angels fan than I ever have been in my life now."" Nurse brought the Larry O'Brien Trophy to Wrigley Field last season and sang ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" while wearing Harry Caray-style glasses. Maddon and the Cubs parted after the season, ending a five-year run that produced a drought-busting championship in 2016. David Ross, a member of the title team, is the new manager. ... F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (sore left groin) played four minutes in his season debut after Nurse said he and F Patrick McCaw (sore left knee) would not be available. McCaw has missed all three games. Bulls: Coach Jim Boylen said F Chandler Hutchison (hamstring) is ""closer than ever"" to making his season debut. ... The Bulls are obviously looking to play better at the United Center after tying New York for the league's worst home record at 9-32 last season. ""It's a huge point of emphasis,"" Boylen said. ""But those are just words. You've got to go do it.""","401160673"
"HOUSTON --  Russell Westbrook said he'll take some time to reflect on the significance of his latest performance. After posting his second straight triple-double since joining the Houston Rockets and the 139th of his career, Westbrook passed Magic Johnson for second on the all-time list, behind only Oscar Robertson's 181. Westbrook had 28 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds and James Harden had 29 points to lead the Rockets to a 126-123 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. ""I know nowadays getting a triple-double seems normal, but I take a lot of pride and a lot of energy and sacrifice and a lot of things I do off the floor to get ready to compete and play at a high level,"" Westbrook said. ""For me, that's a great accomplishment, especially growing up and never thinking I would be able to play in the NBA. Now, I'm able to be in the history books. It's a blessing, and I don't take it for granted."" Westbrook hit two clutch free throws to give Houston the three-point lead with 6.1 seconds remaining. Josh Hart missed a 3 at the buzzer and Houston held on. Houston worked through occasional chemistry issues, frequently turning the ball over on errant passes. Westbrook and Harden combined for 12 turnovers, with Harden leading the game with eight. Harden was 2 of 18 from the 3-point line after going 1 for 8 in the season opener. He was 8-for-29 from the field, but was 11 of 12 from the free throw line. Harden shrugged off the shooting woes. ""I'm going to take as many shots as they give me,"" Harden said. ""Tonight, they didn't fall. But the most important thing is, we've got to win. I think we locked in defensively when we needed to get stops. It's slowly coming together."" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni also said he wasn't alarmed by Harden's rough shooting start to the season. ""I don't care who he's playing against, what kind of scheme -- either he gets 50 or he doesn't, and that's depending on him,"" D'Antoni said. ""I'm expecting next game he'll do it, and if not, the game after."" On Westbrook, D'Antoni complimented his poise and how nothing fazes him, calling the guard ""relentless."" Similarly, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry called Westbrook the Energizer Bunny for his unwavering energy. ""The people that say, `How are they going to fit or how are they going to do?' When you're great players, you find a way to make it work, and they're great players,"" Gentry said. The Rockets bounced back after a 117-111 season-opening loss to Milwaukee on Thursday night. Brandon Ingram gave Houston's defense fits, scoring 35 points while adding a game-high 15 rebounds. Lonzo Ball had 18 points on 4 of 9 shooting from 3. New Orleans is off to its first 0-3 start since the 2016-2017 season. ""We're a work in progress,"" Gentry said. ""I loved the effort that we played with and thought we did a really good job. We put ourselves in a position to win against a really good team."" The Pelicans were without point guard Jrue Holiday, who is day-to-day with a left knee sprain. Hart started in Holiday's place, scoring 23 points in 34 minutes. The Pelicans are already without top draft pick Zion Williamson, who is expected to miss the first six to eight weeks of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee. For the last play of the third quarter, Westbrook found Austin Rivers for a corner 3 to cut New Orleans' lead to 100-97 entering the fourth quarter. The Rockets opened up the final quarter on an 8-0 run, capped off by a thunderous two-handed dunk by Westbrook in transition to put Houston up 105-100. The Rockets led 29-24 at the end of the first quarter, but the Pelicans had a better second quarter and entered halftime tied at 61. In the final play of the first half, Harden was unable to cleanly get a 3 off at the buzzer in a heavily defended shot attempt. After the horn sounded, Harden slammed the ball off the court in frustration, only for it to come back hit him in the mouth. ""It got my beard so it just protected me,"" Harden said with a laugh. TIP-INS Pelicans: Hart received a technical foul shortly after hitting a 3-pointer midway through the third quarter, possibly for taunting but it was unclear. ... Jahlil Okafor fouled out of the game early in the fourth quarter after playing less than 12 minutes in the game. Rockets: All Houston starters scored in double-figures, and Eric Gordon added 13 points off the bench. ... Houston went 13 of 45 from 3 (28.9%). NBA/CHINA RELATIONSHIP There was a pre-game demonstration outside of the main entrance of the Toyota Center by several dozen people holding signs and wearing shirts in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Houston general manager Daryl Morey angered China with a since-deleted tweet in support of the protesters earlier this month. Several protesters attended Thursday night's season opener, but fewer were seen in attendance on Saturday night. ASTROS SCORE UPDATES Some of the loudest cheers from the relatively lightly attended Toyota Center crowd came when the Rockets posted score updates and video highlights on the videoboard from the Houston Astros' World Series Game 4, happening simultaneously in Washington. The Rockets PA announcer even accidentally called JJ Redick ""Josh Reddick"" on one 3-pointer to the crowd before correcting himself. Reddick is an Astros outfielder.","401160674"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs admitted it was tough trading Davis Bertans to Washington, and the subsequent circumstances surrounding his departure only made matters worse. The Spurs certainly had some seller's remorse after Bertans' play Saturday night, but San Antonio was happy to prevail over the Wizards. DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points, including the game-winning basket in heavy traffic in the final seconds, and San Antonio beat Washington 124-122. Bertans, traded from San Antonio to Washington in the offseason, made all five of his 3-point attempts and scored 23 points against his former team. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was grateful Bertans didn't take the Wizards' final shot. ""I almost jumped out on the court,"" Popovich said. ""He had a great game. He was wonderful. He's a super human being, a heck of a player. I'm actually happy for him. He was great. He was great."" Bertans was traded to clear cap space for Marcus Morris, who agreed to a two-year deal with San Antonio only to back out of the agreement and instead sign a one-year contract with New York. Having already dealt Bertans, the Spurs opted to sign Trey Lyles. ""It was emotional a little bit,"" Bertans said of his return. ""I spent a lot of time here. As I see it, even though I got traded, there's nothing but love for the Spurs and that's mutual."" That love was evident in Popovich's playful banter with Bertans on the court following the game and former Spurs general manager R.C. Buford's long embrace with Bertans in the Wizards locker room. Bertans got to see the Spurs grind out a victory as an opponent for the first time in his four-year career. San Antonio recorded its 20th straight home victory over Washington with some late heroics. Using a screen by LaMarcus Aldridge near midcourt, DeRozan drove to the basket and spun in a layup between Rui Hachiumra and Thomas Bryant, putting the Spurs up with 5.5 second remaining. ""I tell him all the time, I need you to take over at all times, not just when we really, really need it,"" San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray said. ""But he did his thing tonight. None of us were shocked or surprised. That's DeMar for you."" Bradley Beal attempted to force overtime with a driving layup, but Derrick White blocked his shot and grabbed the ball as the buzzer sounded. ""Bottom line is, he didn't get the call,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said, ""but that's basketball. You move on to the next game. We keep playing like this, we're going to get the respect."" Aldridge led the Spurs with 27 points. Murray had 10 points, 10 rebounds and four assists and Bryn Forbes added 16 points. Beal had 25 points and Hachimura added 16 points for the Wizards. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington's last victory in San Antonio was Dec. 11, 1999, when Mitch Richmond scored 31 points to beat Tim Duncan, who is now a Spurs assistant coach. ... The Spurs played a tribute video for Bertans prior to player introductions. Bertans averaged 6.2 points in 220 games over three seasons with San Antonio. ... Isaiah Thomas played in his first game since April 7, when he had 10 points and three assists in 24 minutes at Portland. Thomas was healthy, but did not appear in any postseason games for Denver last season. Thomas had 16 points and five assists against the Spurs. Spurs: Aldridge was 2 for 3 on 3-pointers, making multiple 3s in a game for the first time since Dec. 23, 2017. Aldridge has made 124 3-pointers in his 14-year career. ... Bryn Forbes played in his 200th career game, joining Avery Johnson, Bruce Bowen, Mark Olberding, Fabricio Oberto, Jaren Jackson and Gary Neal as the only undrafted players to reach that milestone with the Spurs. ... Lonnie Walker IV drew loud cheers as he made his season debut two minutes into the fourth quarter. Walker made his first attempt, a right-handed runner in the lane, for his only points in five minutes. ... The Spurs had just nine turnovers after committing 21 in their season opener. WATCHING THE CLOCK The Spurs are limiting Murray's minutes as he returns from surgery to repair his right ACL, which forced him to miss last season. Murray played 23 minutes against the Wizards after playing 24 minutes in the Spurs' season opener against the Knicks on Wednesday. The 6-foot-5 guard has looked good in both games, but neither he nor the Spurs are ready to do away with his minutes restriction. ""No, no, no, no, no, I trust them,"" Murray said when asked if he would request more time. ""They've been doing this a long time. So, I trust them and they know what they're doing.""","401160675"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Bojan Bogdanovic wasn't about to let a sore ankle keep him from making his presence felt on offense Bogdanovic hit five 3-pointers and scored 26 points, powering the Utah Jazz to a 113-81 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night. He shot 10 of 18 (.556) from the field overall while playing just 24 minutes after sitting out a game with a sprained left ankle. Bogdanovic was a game-time decision before making his second start. ""It's awesome to see him so happy and just be back,"" guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""He creates. He does a lot of things off the ball. He gets into the paint. It draws a lot of attention and makes it easier for us."" Mitchell added 15 points, while Mike Conley chipped in 12 points and eight assists. Georges Niang added 12 points off the bench. Utah shot 48.6% from 3-point range after shooting just 28.6% from long distance over the team's first two games. ""We all live long enough to have good days and bad days,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""The way that our team responded from (the loss to the Lakers) to me is the significant thing."" Dwayne Dedmon scored 11 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 10 for the Kings, who failed to overcome 37% shooting from the field. The teams combined for 39 turnovers. Sacramento coach Luke Walton pulled all of his starters at once with 8:39 remaining in the third quarter after the Kings fell behind by 32 points. Only Dwayne Dedmon returned in the fourth quarter. ""There really wasn't much to be discussed,"" forward Harrison Barnes said. ""We weren't getting it done with the energy and effort starting off the game in that third quarter, so he made the decision to pull us."" Once Bojan Bogdanovic hit the court, he wasted no time torching Sacramento's defense. He scored three straight baskets to ignite a 16-2 run in the first quarter. Then Bogdanovic punctuated the run with his first 3-point basket, giving the Jazz an 18-8 lead. ""He might need to take a couple of more games off if he's gonna come back like that every time,"" Conley said. ""He's a big piece and when he's hot, he's hot. We kept finding him. Guys were being unselfish and finding the hot hand."" Sacramento cut the deficit to five points on four occasions during the quarter -- the final time on Nemanja Bjelica's layup that made it 28-23. The Jazz offense smothered the Kings after that and steadily pulled away. Jeff Green hit back-to-back 3-pointers to extend Utah's lead to 46-33 early in the second quarter and the Jazz maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way. The Jazz used a 19-2 run, spanning the second and third quarters, to take a 75-43 lead. Bojan Bogdanovic, Mitchell, and Conley all hit 3-pointers to fuel the run, which prompted Walton to sub out his entire starting lineup. ""That's not who we are,"" Walton said. ""That was, honestly, an embarrassing performance we gave out there, coaches included."" ROAD WOES Sacramento has dropped its first two road games by an average margin of 30.5 points. During their 0-3 start, the Kings have allowed each opponent to shoot over 50% from the field. Sacramento, on the other hand, shot under 40% in two of the three contests. Transition baskets, normally a strength for the Kings a season ago, have tapered off. Sacramento has totaled 19 fast-break points in three games. ""Three games, we're barely getting over 100 points,"" Barnes said. ""The fast-break points are obviously low. Our turnovers, you know, aren't allowing us to get out and run."" HOT SHOTS The Jazz tied a franchise record with 13 made 3-pointers in the first half. Bogdanovic accounted for four of those outside baskets. Utah finished the game with 18 3-pointers, after combining for 14 baskets from the perimeter over its first two games against Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Lakers. ""It was much needed,"" Conley said. ""Our defense has really carried over the last few games. Tonight, our offense picked up on that end too."" TIP INS Kings: De'Aaron Fox finished with five assists in 20 minutes. . Bogdanovic's turnaround bank shot with 5.5 seconds left in the second quarter was waved off at halftime after being ruled a shot-clock violation. ... Sacramento forced 21 turnovers.

"PHOENIX --  It had been a downright depressing 24-hour stretch for the Phoenix Suns, who found out their starting center was suspended for 25 games and then immediately lost to the Denver Nuggets by one point in overtime. The next night, with every reason to pout, the Suns didn't do it. Instead, they came out and beat one of the NBA's preseason championship favorites. Devin Booker scored 30 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 20 and the Suns beat the Los Angeles Clippers 130-122 on Saturday for their first win in the series in more than three years. ""It feels amazing,"" Oubre said. ""Everybody chipped in. We fought through adversity once again, we're finding who we are and we're continuing to grow. That's the most beautiful thing about it."" Phoenix (2-1) snapped a 12-game losing streak to the Clippers and won for the first time since losing starting center Deandre Ayton to a 25-game suspension after he tested positive for a diuretic. The Suns had a 15-point lead midway through the fourth quarter before Los Angeles' Lou Williams made things interesting with back-to-back 3-pointers. The Clippers pulled within six on Kawhi Leonard's 3-pointer with less than two minutes left, but the Suns' Tyler Johnson responded with his own 3-pointer to stop the rally. The teams were tied at 55 at halftime and the Suns pushed to a 91-85 lead after three quarters largely thanks to the unlikely duo of Frank Kaminsky III and Jevon Carter, who combined for 17 points during the rally. ""When you have losses like (Denver) on the first night on a back-to-back you're just antsy to play because you have that bad taste in your mouth and it's fresh,"" Kaminsky said. ""That showed tonight. We came out with a lot of energy, physicality and set the tone on defense."" Carter started in the absence of Ricky Rubio, who missed the game because of a knee injury suffered on Friday against Denver. The second-year pro finished with eight points and six assists in 33 minutes. Kaminsky had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. The Suns have won two of the season's first three games for the first time since 2015. ""The fight was really evident tonight,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""Holding that team to 22 points in the first quarter, we got off to a great start. Then after that, they were the Clippers, but we were pretty good."" Los Angeles (2-1) was led by Montrezl Harrell's 28 points. Leonard added 27 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists. The Clippers fought foul trouble for much of the second half, but coach Doc Rivers said his team didn't have anyone to blame but itself after a poor defensive showing. ""You have a couple of these games where you're just late on everything,"" Rivers said. ""I thought we were late on everything. On the offensive end, we had no pace. We deserved to lose."" THE TALKING GAME Booker had an efficient night, shooting 10 of 20 from the field and 3 of 6 from 3-point range. He was also locked in when it came to conversation, going back-and-forth with Clippers guard Patrick Beverley with buckets and barbs. Oubre said Booker's performance was fun to watch. ""It's Devin Booker, man,"" Oubre said. ""I've seen it before. I'll see it again."" TIP-INS Clippers: The Clippers got 66 points from the bench, including Harrell's 28 and Williams' 23.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Finally, Thunder fans have something to cheer about. Dennis Schroder scored 22 points to help Oklahoma City rout the Golden State Warriors 120-92 on Sunday for their first victory of the season. It was a long-awaited ray of hope for fans who have been looking for something to cling to after the Thunder traded away longtime star Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul in the offseason. The blowout matched Oklahoma City's largest margin of victory over the Warriors since the franchise moved from Seattle before the 2008-09 season. The fact that the breakthrough came against the Warriors didn't mean much to Paul. ""I think it was more about us, not about them,"" he said. ""We've got to have an identity. How we are going to play defensively and offensively? Pushing the pace, moving the ball and playing with the right spirit."" Now, Paul and Westbrook will face off Monday night in Houston. Paul said it might be a bit awkward, but he won't make a big deal about it. ""It'll be my first time back there since I got traded so you know, it's another game,"" he said. ""Move on. See a couple familiar faces say what up to my man the equipment manager. Keep it pushing."" The Warriors still have a lot to figure out. Stephen Curry scored 23 points on Sunday, making 7 of 18 shots while his teammates made just 23 of 74. Golden State was coming off a season-opening home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Kevin Durant left the Warriors for Brooklyn in the offseason and Klay Thompson is likely out for the season with a torn left ACL. Still, Golden State expected to be more competitive early in the season. ""It sucks,"" Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ""But I guess just about everybody except Tim Duncan has been through it. But it sucks pretty bad."" Oklahoma City roared out to a 70-37 halftime lead. The Thunder shot 56.5% before the break while holding the Warriors to 27.5%. Schroder had 16 points and six rebounds in the first half.

Oklahoma City led 105-68 heading into the final period. Gallinari scored 21 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 19 points and nine rebounds for the Thunder. The Warriors allowed the Thunder to shoot 56% from the field after allowing the Clippers to shoot 63%. ""Everybody loved our offense, but it wasn't our offense that was making us great,"" Green said.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Rookie Ja Morant had the best game of his young career and veteran Jae Crowder hit a game-winner to make the Memphis Grizzlies' first victory of the season memorable. Crowder's 3-pointer from the top of the key as time expired in overtime lifted the Grizzlies to a 134-133 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night. ""We've been playing well these first two games,"" Crowder said of losses to Miami and Chicago. ""We put five quarters together and came out with a win."" The winning shot was possible after Spencer Dinwiddie split a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds left, Grizzlies reserve Solomon Hill grabbing the rebound when the second shot was missed. After a Nets foul in the backcourt, Memphis inbounded the ball with 3.7 seconds left. Morant, who led the Grizzlies with 30 points, dribbled behind his back as he crossed half court, then handed out his ninth assist, shuffling a pass to the trailing Crowder for the 28-foot game-winner. ""I believe in Jae the whole way, and he delivered for us,"" Morant, the second pick in last summer's NBA Draft, said of the winning basket. ""Anytime you lose at the buzzer, it's always a tough loss,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Dillon Brooks scored 21 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies. Morant also blocked Kyrie Irving's 17-footer at the end of regulation to keep the score tied at 120-all. Crowder's winning 3-pointer was his second basket of the game, as he finished with six points. His previous 3-pointer came with 1:09 left as Memphis took its first lead of overtime at 131-128. Irving finished with 37 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Nets. Caris LeVert added 27 points, Dinwiddie had 16 points on 3-for-13 shooting from the field. ""What a game, huh?"" Grizzlies first-year coach Taylor Jenkins said. "". Obviously, to get our first win of the season it took a complete team effort."" Morant led that ""team effort,"" helping Memphis reach overtime by scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter. Morant's layup -- his final points of the period -- tied the score at 120 with 7 seconds left. He blocked Irving on the ensuing possession as time ran out in regulation. ""I head-faked,"" Irving said. ""I tried to shoot a fade. He's got long arms. He got a good contest on it and blocked the shot.""

"DALLAS --  Damian Lillard helped the Portland Trail Blazers a few ways on Sunday night. He scored the eventual winning basket and talked his coach into making a replay challenge, all in the closing seconds. Lillard's twisting layup with 26 seconds remaining proved to be the winner as the Trail Blazers beat the Dallas Mavericks 121-119. Lillard scored 26 of his 28 points in the second half, including a basket that gave the Blazers a 120-119 lead. The Blazers' CJ McCollum had a game-high 35 points. Kristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 32 points. After Lillard's score, the Mavericks' Luka Doncic missed a 3-point attempt and Portland won a challenge of a call that would have sent the Mavericks' Dorian Finney-Smith to the foul line after he'd grabbed a rebound and attempted a shot with eight seconds left. The foul was called on Lillard. Instead, there was a jump ball. Crew chief Courtney Kirkland explained how a one-year experimental rule applied to this review. ""Once Portland challenged the play and we were able to go and look at replay, we were able to have clear, conclusive evidence that Damian Lillard legally deflected the ball from Dorian Finney-Smith. The ball was loose when the whistle blew, which led to an inadvertent whistle. Therefore, we ended up having a jump ball."" Lillard had insisted to coach Terry Stotts that he should challenge the call, even though losing it would have cost the Blazers' last timeout. ""If we lose the challenge, they are on the (foul) line and we are down one (point), but (Lillard) was pretty adamant, so I trusted him,"" Stotts said. Dallas still seemed likely to win the jump with 7-foot-3 center Kristaps Porzingis. Portland center Hassan Whiteside had fouled out and 7-footer Zach Collins left the game with an injury. ""I was thinking we don't even have a five man in the game, so how are we going to win a jump ball?"" McCollum said. ""Then Porzingis tipped it to us, so it worked out."" The Blazers' Kent Bazemore got the ball and was fouled. He made the first of two free throws. Doncic rebounded and passed to Tim Hardaway, whose shot from about midcourt rattled off the front of the rim as time expired. Lillard, who scored 67 points in Portland's first two games, had only two points in the first half on 1-for-7 shooting. ""I didn't feel bad,"" he said. ""I didn't feel like I was just missing terrible shots."" Porzingis said the Mavericks discussed at halftime trying to keep Lillard in check. ""We knew we couldn't let him get going. Then in the second half, Damian really got going."" For Portland, Rodney Hood had 20 points, Bazemore 11 and Zach Collins 10. Doncic finished with 29 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. Teammate Maxi Kleber had 14 points, Seth Curry 12 and Hardaway 11. Portland never held the lead through the first three periods but rallied to tie the game at 95 on one of two free throws by Lillard eight seconds before the end of the third quarter. Dallas struggled through a 2-for-19 shooting spell and fell behind by as many as six points before Curry hit a 3-pointer that tied the game at 107. Kleber, who had totaled only eight points in the Mavericks' first two games, scored eight in the first 2:49 with two 3-pointers and a dunk. Dallas led at halftime 71-59. OWNER'S TWEET-MENT Mark Cuban tweeted about Portland's successful challenge. ""I'm a fan of the nba challenge rule, but if a play is overturned and they don't show the replay that justifies overturning a call along with an explanation then it's going to have real problems. From the angles we saw in arena it looked like a clean strip but body contact first."" GOOD TIME, LONG TIME Dallas' Kristaps Porzingis' 32 points marked the 15th time he has scored 30 or more, and the first since December 2017. For Portland, McCollum's 35 points were his most in a game since he scored 40 on Dec. 12, 2018. TIP-INS Blazers: F Zach Collins left the court holding his right shoulder in the third quarter. ... F/C Pau Gasol still hasn't played in his 18th season because of an injured left foot.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Andrew Wiggins has been the face of unfulfilled potential for the Minnesota Timberwolves, beginning his sixth NBA season and starting the second year of his $147 million maximum contract. The Timberwolves haven't come close to giving up on him, though, and Wiggins put on a late-game show in their home opener that provided another reminder of why they're counting on more progress. Wiggins made four 3-pointers and scored 16 of his 25 points in the final six minutes, propelling the undefeated Timberwolves to a 116-109 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday night. ""It's going to take time for all of it to come together with our emphasis and changing of systems, but he is going to have a good year,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""I'm in his corner, and I want to make sure he knows that."" How often does Wiggins hear that? ""Every day he's telling me I'm going to have a good year,"" he said. ""Just trust in the system."" Karl-Anthony Towns added 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Wolves (3-0), who matched the second-best start in this long-languishing franchise's history. They were 6-0 in 2001-02 and 3-0 in 2013-14. The Wolves have trailed in all three games, and Wiggins produced clutch contributions in two of them. ""He's a star player, and he knows when he has to kick it up,"" Towns said. ""For some reason, he always hits those shots at the end when we need him the most."" Kendrick Nunn had 25 points on 5-for-9 shooting from 3-point range, Duncan Robinson pitched in with 21 points, and Justise Winslow scored 20 for the Heat, who played again without new star Jimmy Butler and took their first loss after playing in Milwaukee the day before. ""That's two straight games where the first half really hurt us and we expended a lot of emotional energy,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""In the first half, we just didn't bring the necessary passion and communication."" After erasing a 21-point deficit in the third quarter to beat NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in overtime Saturday, the Heat didn't flinch after trailing by 13 at the end of the first quarter and facing a double-digit margin for most of the second period. Goran Dragic swished a 3-pointer for a 57-53 lead, capping an 18-2 run just before the break. The Heat had a lead as big as 84-74 on Robinson's 3-pointer late in the third quarter, but Towns answered from behind the arc in the final minute of that period to give the Wolves momentum. Adapting to a faster-paced, 3-point-friendly style under Saunders, they climbed back into striking range with stiffer defense before Wiggins delivered the decisive blows. ""I'm going to keep at it. Whenever they need me to make a play down the stretch, I'm going to give it my all to make a play,"" Wiggins said. After started the season 0 for 13 from long range, Wiggins had a well-timed first make with 5:52 left to tie the game at 96. He gave the Wolves the lead for good with 2:56 left, the first of three 3-pointers he hit in as many possessions. With 1:45 remaining, he simply dribbled back and forth on the left wing and, with Robinson trying to guard him, stepped back to swish the inevitable launch for a 110-101 edge that gave him 11 straight points. His teammates mobbed him on the court after the Heat called a timeout. ""If you're a scorer, you see the ball go in, you start to get some rhythm, now you can become a lot more dangerous,"" Spoelstra said. ""In the fourth quarter, basically you really have to treat everybody as a threat, regardless of where they are on the scouting report. You just can't give open looks."" TIP-INS Heat: With Butler out, Derrick Jones Jr. (groin) injured and Dion Waiters and James Johnson still away from the team for disciplinary reasons, the bench was thinned to six backups, including a pair of two-way players. Veteran forward Udonis Haslem (wrist) was active for the first time this season but did not play. ... The Heat went 10 for 15 from the free throw line, perpetuating a problem from last season. Timberwolves: After joining Kevin Garnett (1999-2000) as the only players in franchise history to post consecutive 30-point, 10-rebound games to start a season, Towns went 2 for 11 from the field after the first quarter. ... The Wolves have won four straight home openers. NUNN BETTER Nunn, one of four rookies on a Heat roster that's half-filled with under-25 players, has been quite the fill-in for Butler on the wing over his first three NBA games. Nunn came off the bench in the G League for the Santa Cruz Warriors last season, but he parlayed a strong Summer League performance for the Heat into a prominent spot in the rotation so far. NO JEERING JIMMY Butler became a father earlier this week when his girlfriend had a baby, his paternity leave delaying the debut for Miami's prize offseason addition. The crowd in Minnesota was also deprived of the now-annual opportunity to direct boos at Butler, who forced his way out a year ago after helping the Wolves in 2017-18 end a 13-season absence from the playoffs. The fans had their first chance to jeer last spring when Butler played here with Philadelphia.","401160681"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Lakers acquired two veteran NBA big men in the offseason, and they both got wild cheers for their outstanding performances Sunday night in a runaway win over Charlotte. That's no surprise in the case of Anthony Davis, who gave Lakers fans their best look yet at his world-class talent. In the case of Dwight Howard, it's a minor miracle how quickly he has landed in Los Angeles' good graces again. Davis had 29 points and 14 rebounds, and Howard added 16 points, 10 boards and four blocked shots in a 120-101 victory over the Hornets. LeBron James had 20 points, 12 assists and six rebounds for the Lakers, who took control of their second straight victory with an 18-2 rally starting late in the third quarter. But he was most excited afterward about their strong defensive performance and the potential for growth encapsulated in Davis and Howard. ""That's the luxury of our depth,"" James said. Davis showed off the breadth of his skills during a 25-point first half, scoring 16 points in the first quarter while dominating on both ends. After a sometimes-tentative start to his Lakers career, he was aggressive from the start against Charlotte's young frontcourt. ""I shot the ball poorly the first two games, and I was just trying to get into a rhythm,"" Davis said. ""When I get easy looks, it kind of gets me going."" When Davis took a step back after halftime, James and Howard took charge. That's what the Lakers' depth allows them to do in difficult matchups, even with these partnerships and connections still new in the third game of the season. While James orchestrated the offense, Howard put in an impressive all-around performance that drew multiple ovations from the same fan base that booed him relentlessly for the past six years after he left the Lakers in free agency. Now back as a reserve center, Howard has already turned the tide with his dunks, defense and overall effort in the team's first two home games. When Howard blocked a shot into the crowd and did a Mutombo finger-wag while flashing his famous smile, Lakers fans jumped from their seats to cheer. ""I wasn't thinking about anything but doing whatever I can to help the team win, keep the crowd energized,"" Howard said. ""Great things happen when you do that. I'm just going to keep doing whatever it takes and enjoy every moment on the court."" Miles Bridges scored 23 points, while Cody Zeller and Terry Rozier added 19 apiece for the Hornets in the opener of a four-game road trip. Charlotte's 1-for-12 shooting on 3-pointers in the third quarter allowed the Lakers to break it open. ""We were trying to get out in front of the situation, but they're a championship-level team,"" Bridges said. ""It was a close game. They've got veterans. They did what they did, and we showed our youth a little bit."" Bridges scored 15 points in the first half, but Los Angeles held the Hornets to 39 points after halftime. ""I thought we competed tonight,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""I thought we were great. ... (Bridges) really stood out to me tonight (with) his maturity, the way he's grown, the presence he has, the way he attacked them. He took on that challenge of guarding LeBron, and I thought he was great tonight."" AD'S OPENER Davis was dominant from the start, racking up his 16 points in the first quarter on 6-of-8 shooting. He hit three 3-pointers and grabbed six rebounds during his huge first half. He even persevered after Zeller and Davis accidentally elbowed each other in the face while fighting for a rebound with 2:10 to play. Zeller got a loose ball foul after a long video review, but he was in the Hornets' locker room getting help for a cut. QUIET START James didn't score his first points until he hit two free throws 1:40 before halftime, and he got his first field goal with a layup on LA's next possession. James was mostly a facilitator until the fourth quarter, when he scored his 10th point on a layup with 9:57 left. James hasn't been held under 10 points in a regular-season game since Jan. 5, 2007, although it also happened twice in the playoffs in the nearly 13 years since. TIP-INS Hornets: Devonte Graham converted a four-point play in the second quarter. He finished with nine points after scoring 23 and 24 in the Hornets' first two games. ... Nicolas Batum missed his second straight game with a broken finger on his left hand. The big man got hurt in Charlotte's season opener. Lakers: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope finished with 10 points after he ended his 0-for-11 start to the season from the field with three straight baskets in the second quarter. ... The backup point guards both played well. Quinn Cook had 12 points and eight assists, and Alex Caruso added five points and two assists.","401160682"
"DETROIT --  Derrick Rose made a driving layup with 28.3 seconds left to give Detroit the lead, and the Pistons went on to a 96-94 victory over winless Indiana on Monday night for their second win against the Pacers in less than a week. Rose shot just 4 of 16 from the field and was having a particularly tough time in the fourth quarter, but his left-handed layup went in off the glass to put Detroit up 95-94. Malcolm Brogdon missed at the other end, but Indiana got an offensive rebound. T.J. Warren then missed badly on a tough shot from the corner, and the Pistons came up with the ball. Luke Kennard made one of two free throws for Detroit, and Indiana had one more chance with 2 seconds left. Warren missed a 3-pointer from the left wing. Andre Drummond had 18 points and 18 rebounds for the Pistons, and Christian Wood had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Detroit led most of the game, but the Pacers erased a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter and led by four late. Kennard then got a fortunate bounce on a 3-pointer to make it 94-93, and Rose's basket gave the Pistons the lead. Domantas Sabonis had 21 points and 14 rebounds for Indiana, and Brogdon contributed 15 points and 11 assists. REPEAT Indiana entered the night one of five NBA teams without a victory. The Pacers are minus star guard Victor Oladipo, who is still working his way back from a right knee injury. But the Pistons are nowhere near full strength either -- Blake Griffin (hamstring and knee injuries) hasn't played yet this season -- and they've still beaten Indiana twice. TIP-INS Pacers: G Jeremy Lamb (right hip pointer) did not play. Pistons: Detroit was also without G Reggie Jackson (lower back tightness) and rookie F Sekou Doumbouya (concussion protocol). ... Former Pistons star Isiah Thomas was at the game, and the team announced it is teaming up with him on a champagne sponsorship deal.","401160683"
"NEW YORK --  Bobby Portis is over his anger at the Chicago Bulls, so Monday night wasn't about the need for revenge. All he wanted was a win, and he knew it wouldn't come until he started playing better. Portis scored a season-high 28 points against his former team, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:47 remaining, and the New York Knicks beat the Bulls 105-98 for their first victory of the season. Portis had totaled just 18 points in his first three games with the Knicks, but was superb in bringing New York back from an 18-point deficit. The reserve was 10 for 14, making all four 3-pointers, and added 11 rebounds. The 2015 first-round pick of the Bulls spent 3 1/2 seasons in Chicago before being traded last season to Washington. He played them three times after the trade, so he viewed them as just another team -- even though it appeared he turned and said something toward the Bulls bench after one of his baskets. ""I'm just an animated player. I don't know what I'm saying sometimes,"" Portis said. ""I just have fun. I love playing this game. ""I feel like I wasn't myself the first couple games and I didn't bring the energy, so I had to get back to being who I am."" The Knicks needed all of it on a night when they fell behind with a dreadful start and stayed that way until the fourth quarter. They never even led until Portis' go-ahead 3, which he followed with another 3 that pushed it to 103-98 during a 15-0 run to finish the game. ""I've always said that Bobby Portis is one of my favorite guys of all time,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""He's a tough, competitive guy who works and cares. We traded Bobby Portis because that's what happens in our league. It doesn't mean we're not fond of that player or don't believe in that player. There are situations when a deal works and you put a player in it. He played great tonight. I'm disappointed that we lost but I'm happy that he played well."" Rookie RJ Barrett added 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who had dropped their first three games. Kevin Knox II scored 14 points, and Julius Randle finished with 13 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. Zach LaVine scored 21 points for the Bulls, who fell to 1-3. Wendell Carter Jr. had 20 points and 10 rebounds -- and didn't buy that it was just another game for Portis. ""He was juiced about this game as soon as he came to New York,"" Carter said. ""He put on social media that he was looking forward to playing against the Chicago Bulls. We all knew that he was excited and very juiced, and he played a great game."" The Knicks missed 13 of their first 15 shots and quickly fell behind by double digits. The Bulls led 33-15 after one quarter and re-opened an 18-point cushion in the third quarter. After Portis made a 3-pointer to tie it at 88 with 6:09 to go, Chicago pushed ahead again. LaVine and Lauri Markkanen made consecutive 3-pointers to cap a 10-2 burst that made it 98-90 with about 3 1/2 minutes left, but the Knicks pitched a shutout from there. Fans chanted Portis' name in the final minute after booing the Knicks during their home opener two nights earlier. ""It was great. It was electric in there,"" Barrett said. ""Hopefully we get to have this feeling many more times."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago scored before any time had come off the clock in the third quarter. The Knicks' Marcus Morris was called for a technical foul as the first half ended, and LaVine made the technical free throw before the second half began. ... Markkanen scored 18 points. Knicks: The Knicks were without Dennis Smith Jr., who is away from the team because of a death in his family. Coach David Fizdale said he didn't know when Smith would rejoin the team, saying it was the guard's choice. ... Elfrid Payton left the game with a sore right hamstring. ... The Knicks said Al Bianchi died Monday in Arizona at 87. Bianchi was the Knicks' general manager from 1987-91. PERFECT NO MORE Otto Porter Jr., who was dealt to the Bulls from Washington in the Portis trade, lost for the first time as a pro at Madison Square Garden. He had been 7-0. RANDLE'S ROLL Randle has double-doubles in all four games, the longest streak by a player to begin his Knicks career since Zach Randolph did it in his first seven in 2007-08.","401160684"
"ATLANTA --  Joel Embiid missed the previous game with an ankle injury, and the Philadelphia 76ers weren't sure he'd be able to play Monday night until he tested it during warmups. He didn't seem to be in any pain. Embiid scored 36 points, including the winning free throws with 5.3 seconds left, and the 76ers won their third straight to begin the season with a 105-103 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. In a matchup between the last two unbeaten teams in the Eastern Conference, Philadelphia made things tough for Trae Young and dominated down the stretch to deny the young Hawks their first 3-0 start in three seasons. Embiid made 12 of 19 shots from the field -- including a couple of 3-pointers -- and knocked down all 10 of his free throws. He also had 13 rebounds, five assists and three steals. ""He was our crown jewel in a blatant way,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We needed him, particularly offensively."" The Hawks tied the game at 103 with 7.4 seconds left when John Collins tipped in a missed free throw by Young to complete a de facto three-point play after the Atlanta guard made his first attempt from the line. The 76ers had fouled Young before he could attempt a tying 3, but the Hawks wound up getting the points they needed when Al Horford failed to block out Collins, who flexed both arms on his way back down the court. After a timeout, Horford made up for his mistake by lobbing a pass to Embiid breaking loose in the lane. Collins fouled the 76ers big man to deny the basket, but Embiid calmly drained both free throws. The Hawks had one final chance, getting the ball to 42-year-old Vince Carter sprinting along the sideline. He threw up a wild 3 that never really had a chance, bouncing over the backboard as the horn sounded. Tobias Harris had eight of his 13 points in the final quarter as the 76ers outscored the Hawks 15-5 over the final five minutes. Josh Richardson chipped in with 14 points, and Ben Simmons also had 14. ""We have a lot of weapons,"" Embiid insisted. Young, the first Eastern Conference player of the week this season, had 25 points on 7-of-20 shooting. Collins added 16 points and De'Andre Hunter 14, including a 3 from the corner that gave the Hawks a 98-90 lead. Philadelphia dominated the rest of the way. Young averaged 38.5 points in Atlanta's first two games. He was held to six over the final two quarters by the 76ers. ""They were denying me the ball,"" he said. ""They got it out of my hands the whole game."" The 76ers made sure Young didn't get a chance on that final play. ""I had two defenders on me,"" he said. ""I couldn't get open."" INJURY REPORT Philadelphia's Shake Milton exited in the third quarter with a hyperextended left knee. He was injured on a drive to the basket when he stepped on an Atlanta player's foot and twisted his knee. Before that, Milton gave the 76ers a boost off the bench by scoring nine points. TIP-INS 76ers: Former Hawk Mike Scott was ejected in the second quarter for a flagrant foul on Atlanta's Damian Jones. Scott gave Jones a chest bump as the Hawks center was driving to the basket, sending him flying out of bounds. While the play didn't look especially egregious, officials upheld the call after checking the replay. Scott shook hands with Jones before leaving the court, stopping on his way to the locker room to give his wrist bands to young fans hanging over the railing. ... Philadelphia trailed by 13 midway through the opening quarter and didn't grab its first lead until late in the first half. The 76ers never led by more than four. ""We were soft in that first quarter,"" Embiid said. ""We just had to turn it on a little bit."" Hawks: No. 10 overall draft pick Cam Reddish hasn't made much of an impact in his first three NBA games. He has a total of 11 points. ... Carter played only 10 minutes but was on the court for key minutes down the stretch. ... Rookie C Bruno Fernando had the first double-figure scoring game of his career with 11 points. ... Collins fouled out on the play that led to Embiid's winning free throws.","401160685"
"TORONTO --  The Orlando Magic are the only NBA team still looking for their first 100-point game of the season. Another score in the 90s wasn't enough to stop the Toronto Raptors. Kyle Lowry got 10 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, Pascal Siakam added 24 and the Raptors withstood a late rally to beat the Magic 104-95 on Monday night for their third win in four games to start the year. Marc Gasol had 10 points and 10 rebounds, Fred VanVleet scored 14 and OG Anunoby added 12 as the Raptors won for the 10th time in 15 regular-season meetings with Orlando. Jonathan Isaac scored a career-high 24 points, Evan Fournier had 18 and Markelle Fultz 13 for the Magic, who have lost two straight. Ex-Raptor Terrence Ross scored 11 for Orlando, and D.J. Augustin had 10. Isaac and Fultz combined to shoot 13 for 21, but the rest of the Magic went 21 for 68. ""We've just got to stick to the plan,"" Isaac said. ""Guys haven't shot the ball great. I hit some shots tonight but I haven't shot the ball great. All of us, we just need to step up, make open shots and continue to trust the offense and we'll be OK."" Orlando center Nikola Vucevic finished 1 for 13 and scored five points in 25 minutes. He did not play in the fourth. ""Offensively, we can't get much going,"" Vucevic said. ""We need to figure it out sooner than later."" The Magic trailed 81-67 after VanVleet's three-point play to begin the final quarter, but Ross' 3-pointer with 4:18 to play capped a 13-0 run that gave Orlando an 89-87 lead, its first since being up 9-7. After a timeout, Siakam halted the run with a three-point play. Fultz replied with a reverse layup but Lowry hit a 3, then made a pair of free throws to put Toronto ahead 95-91 with 2:35 to go. ""That's a sign of us hanging in there real strong,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Lowry was later fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three at the line. Toronto went 13 for 13 on free throws in the fourth. ""Lowry scored six points on mistakes late,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""That was it."" After finishing 5 of 31 from 3-point range in Saturday's 103-99 loss to Atlanta, the Magic went 4 for 10 in the first quarter Monday. However, they shot 4 of 15 from inside the arc, missing 10 straight to begin the game. Isaac had three of Orlando's 3-pointers in the opening quarter. Siakam scored 11 points in the first and the Raptors were 6 of 13 from long range to lead 31-22 after one. Toronto shot 4 for 20 in the second, missing 11 straight before consecutive baskets from Lowry in the final 28 seconds, including a buzzer-beating reverse layup that gave the Raptors a 51-46 halftime lead. Gasol scored five points in an 11-2 Toronto run to start the third, and the Raptors took a 78-67 lead into the fourth. THROWBACK On the first of six nights scheduled to celebrate the Raptors' 25th anniversary season, Toronto wore its original warmups and pinstriped dinosaur jerseys. The game was played on a replica of the 1995 court, with 2-point territory shaded purple. FAMILIAR FOE Orlando beat Toronto in Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs last spring, but the Raptors bounced back to win the series in five games before going on to capture the first NBA title in franchise history. BAD MEMORY Vucevic said he couldn't recall enduring such a rough shooting performance. ""I don't remember going 1 for 13,"" he said. ""I don't think I've ever done that before."" UNDER 100 Toronto, which beat Chicago 108-84 Saturday, has held opponents below 100 points in back-to-back games. The Raptors did that three times last season.

"Russell Westbrook explains what it's like for him to have friends in the NBA and how when he's in the middle of a game, all those friendships go out the window. (0:38) HOUSTON --  After Russell Westbrook helped the Houston Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night in his first meeting against his former team he insisted there weren't different emotions in facing the guys he played with for so long. ""When I hoop I have no friends,"" he said. ""On the court they know not to talk to me."" But as soon as Westbrook finished saying that, he walked right down the hall and bounded into the visitor's locker room for a reunion with his former teammates. James Harden scored 40 points and Westbrook scored 21 and fell an assist shy of a triple-double as the Rockets got the 116-112 win. Some players seemed taken aback to see Westbrook in their locker room and a confused Dennis Schroder asked him what he was doing in there. Westbrook smiled and said: ""Same thing I've been doing, coming to check on my homies."" Westbrook had 12 rebounds and nine assists after notching his 139th triple-double in his last game to pass Magic Johnson for second-most all-time. A 3-pointer by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 19 seconds left got Oklahoma City within 3. Westbrook made 1 of 2 free throws before fouling Nerlens Noel, who made both free throws. But Harden, who was 21 of 22 from the line, made four free throws down the stretch to secure the victory. It was the first game between these teams since a blockbuster summer trade reunited Westbrook with Harden and sent Chris Paul to Oklahoma City after the nine-time All-Star failed to help the Rockets to a title in two seasons in Houston. Paul had 15 points, four assists and five rebounds. Just before tipoff, Westbrook approached the Thunder bench and hugged coach Billy Donovan before slapping hands and greeting virtually every player on the bench. Westbrook spent the first 11 years of his career in Oklahoma City where he was the face of the franchise before moving to Houston in the deal the Rockets hope will help bring them their first title since 1995. Gilgeous-Alexander had 22 points and Schroder added 22 points to lead the Thunder, who fell to 1-3. Houston used a 39-point third quarter to take an 11-point lead into the fourth quarter. ""We picked up our defensive intensity,"" Harden said. ""That's going to be what gets us over the top, what gets us where we want to go. We got a little lackadaisical in the first half. Second half we picked it up and look at the results."" The Rockets opened the third quarter with a 17-4 run to erase a 10-point halftime deficit and take a 69-66 lead with about seven minutes left in the quarter. A 3-pointer by Tucker put Houston on top and Westbrook punctuated the run with a dunk before screaming and flexing as he passed the Thunder bench. PAUL HONORED The Rockets honored Paul with a video tribute that recounted some of his Houston highlights during a timeout in the first quarter. Paul got a huge ovation at the end of the video and smiled and waved to the crowd when he was shown on the Jumbotron. ""Extremely grateful,"" he said of the tribute. ""The fans here were always great to me and my family ... some of the people here became like family to me and I try to stay in touch with those who were as genuine as could be.""

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks were in a serious mood Monday night after a loss to Miami in their home opener over the weekend. Khris Middleton scored 21 points and the Bucks used a strong finish to hold off the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-112. Middleton scored 10 points in a late 28-12 run and seven Milwaukee (2-1) players finished in double figures. ""Khris really kind of put the nail in the coffin with a couple of his finishes,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He's a big shot-maker and closer."" Cleveland had pulled within 96-91 on a Tristan Thompson dunk with 9:26 remaining, but Milwaukee responded. Point guard Eric Bledsoe had six points as the Bucks went up by 12, and Middleton hit a pair of 3-pointers, the second one giving Milwaukee a 124-103 lead with 2:50 remaining. On a relatively quiet night for Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo (14 points on 5-of-15 shooting and 10 rebounds), Milwaukee got a huge boost from reserves George Hill and Pat Connaughton. Hill had 19 points and Connaughton scored 17, including 14 in the first half. ""We play great together; we have great continuity,"" Connaughton said. ""For us, it's about making sure we bring the energy and winning plays and do our job."" Brook Lopez had 16 points and Wesley Matthews and Bledsoe each added 14 for Milwaukee. Cleveland (1-2) was led by guard Collin Sexton with 18 points, and Tristan Thompson and Jordan Clarkson each had 17. ""This is a great team,"" Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. said. ""They're probably picked to come out of the East this year. ""So to play on their court and battle them down to near the last minute is positive. ""We put a lot of emphasis on Giannis, but that's what makes this team great. You take him out of it or at least contain him to a certain extent, and the other guys stepped up. Pat, G. Hill, Kyle (Korver). That's what makes these guys tough to beat."" The Bucks sank 17 of 38 attempts from 3-point range (44.7%), with Connaughton going 4 of 5 beyond the arc and Middleton hitting 3 of 5. ""They've been averaging 50 (three-point attempts) and they only got 38 off,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""They got some really good open ones but that's because they're veterans. There's a reason why they're contenders for the NBA championship."" Milwaukee trailed 31-30 after the first quarter, but rallied to take a 59-52 halftime lead. Connaughton scored 11 points in the second quarter. Hill, obtained from the Bucks in a trade with Cleveland last December, hit 7 of 10 shots and added eight rebounds and three assists. ""I think the first two games I was being very passive and unselfish and trying to make the right play instead of just playing basketball,"" Hill said. ""I'm just trying to make an impact on both ends."" Antetokounmpo scored 30 points while posting a triple-double in the Bucks' season-opening win at Houston and had 29 in the overtime loss to Miami. But he wasn't worried about being limited to 14 against Cleveland while dishing out seven assists. ""I'm just trying to be aggressive,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""One of the things I do well is finding others open shots. If I see a guy open, I just want to pass it on the money and hopefully he'll knock it down."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Former Bucks player John Henson played 8 minutes (3 points, 3 rebounds) in Cleveland's 110-99 victory over Indiana on Saturday, but suffered a strained right hamstring that could sideline him for a month. The Cavaliers acquired him from Milwaukee in a three-team deal last December, but he was out the rest of the season following wrist surgery. Henson and Ante Zizic (left foot plantar fasciitis) were out. ... Beilein is quite familiar with Bucks forward D.J. Wilson, who played for him at Michigan. ""He's got so many tools with his length and overall ability,"" Beilein said. ""He can shoot; he can pass. Finding his place and staying healthy and all those things are going to be key for him."" Bucks: Foul woes plagued Milwaukee in its first two games, and Antetokounmpo fouled out of both contests. Opponents are doing their best to draw fouls on the Bucks star or force a call by the officials. ""I haven't picked up on a strategy,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think Giannis can be more disciplined. He knows that. I have a ton of confidence that he can self-correct."" Antetokounmpo had two fouls in 29 minutes on Monday.","401160688"
"Steph Curry talks about what it feels like to have the first win of the season, citing the critics who doubted the Warriors and threw ""darts"" after a slow start. (0:34) NEW ORLEANS -- Draymond Green turned in the all-court performance the Golden State Warriors needed to secure their first victory of the season, and then said what he felt was necessary to preserve maximum humility and hunger in the locker room. ""We're still not a very good team,"" Green said. Green had 16 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists, leading the Warriors to a 134-123 victory over winless New Orleans on Monday night. Stephen Curry had 26 points, 11 assists and three steals for Golden State, which dropped its first two games by 19 or more points before dominating a Pelicans squad that was missing three injured starters, including top overall draft choice Zion Williamson. ""We got to continue to compete at a high level. The first two nights we didn't do that. Tonight we did,"" Green said, stressing the Warriors have seven players with three or fewer years of experience in the NBA. ""As leaders of this team, we continue to try to bring it every night and give them something to follow and, you know, we'll win some games."" D'Angelo Russell added 24 points, and Damion Lee set career highs with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Green's layup with 5:07 left put the Warriors ahead 128-99 before the Pelicans made an inconsequential run to make the final score look more competitive than the bulk of the game was. ""We were never in the game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We never had any chance at all to win and I think that's the most disturbing thing to me -- especially playing at home."" Brandon Ingram had 27 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who had not lost any of their first three games by more than seven points before being run out of their own building by the Curry and Co. The Pelicans were playing a second straight game without veteran guard Jrue Holiday, who has a sprained left knee, and also were without starting center Derrick Favors because of right knee soreness. ""We have enough guys in here where we feel like we can win basketball games,"" Ingram said. ""We won't get discouraged at all."" TIP-INS Warriors: Glen Robinson III had 12 points and nine assists. ... Kevon Looney missed his second straight game with right hamstring tightness, while Alec Burks (right ankle sprain), Willie Cauley-Stein (left foot sprain) and Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) have yet to make their season debut. Pelicans: Lonzo Ball had 12 points and nine assists. ... First-round draft pick Jaxson Hayes had 19 points in his Pelicans debut. ... Kenrich Williams scored 16 points and rookie Nickeil Alexander-Walker, picked 17th overall, had 15 points and nine assists. ... Veteran guard E'Twaun Moore did not play for a third straight game despite being healthy. NEW REALITY Curry said he and Green are accepting more complicated roles on a team that is trying to assimilate an infusion of youth. ""It's going to be a theme of the season -- we have to fight for everything we get this year and it may not be pretty,"" Curry said. ""It's not only do we have to perform every night, (but) for lack of a better term, you've got to teach."" ""We accept that challenge and that responsibility,"" Curry added. FIRST IMPRESSION Hayes debuted as a reserve, playing almost 24 minutes and pleasing the crowd with several dunks, including one on a long alley-oop pass from Ball. ""It felt great finally being out there and being able to play,"" Hayes said. ""We just have so many new people. I feel like just getting used to playing with each other, learning the defense, all that type of stuff will just help a lot more."" OFF THE MARK New Orleans went 15 of 47 (31.9 percent) from 3-point range and missed 10 of 22 free throws. J.J. Redick had a rough night for the Pelicans. The normally reliable veteran missed nine of 10 shots, including eight of nine from 3.","401160689"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Portland point guard Damian Lillard refused to give up when all seemed lost, and nearly willed the Trail Blazers to an improbable win over the San Antonio Spurs. DeMar DeRozan scored 27 points and San Antonio overcame a sluggish start and Lillard's hot finish to beat Portland 113-110 Monday night to remain undefeated. San Antonio is 3-0 for the eighth time in its 43-year history, but this outcome was in doubt until Lillard's 3-pointer from the right corner bounced in and out as time expired. ""We were on him,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He made shots. He drove it too easily, that's for sure. We didn't stay in front of him very well down the stretch, but he's a great player. He put it on himself to just take it and attack the rim and he did and we didn't stay in front of him very well."" Lillard had 28 points, including 18 straight in the final four minutes, as Portland erased a 15-point deficit. The 6-foot-3 guard was limited to 10 points on 3-for-16 shooting through three quarters before going 6 for 12 in the fourth. ""I'm not going to shy away because of that or try to go away and say, `Alright, it's just not my night,' "" Lillard said. ""I'm going to empty it and I'm going to go out swinging."" He almost took down San Antonio by himself. The Spurs seemed poised for a comfortable win after narrow victories against New York and Washington, but nearly let the game get away by closing out the contest as sloppily as they opened. Lillard took the Blazers on an 18-2 run, capped by a pair of 3s to close within 107-104 with 1:57 remaining. A dunk by Lillard cut the margin to a point, 109-108, with 1:10 left. Lillard and Anthony Tolliver missed consecutive 3-point attempts with Portland trailing 113-100. DeRozan missed a pair of free throws, setting up Lillard's final shot. ""You can never count a guy like Damian out,"" DeRozan said. ""He could get it going and missed shots are not going to deter him from trying to get it going. You've got to be aware and he got it going. Thank God we got bailed out."" San Antonio outscored Portland 30-27 in the third quarter after scoring just 19 points in the first period. The Blazers had a torrid start despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back and escaping with a 121-119 victory in Dallas on Sunday. CJ McCollum added 27 points for the Blazers (2-2). Derrick White added 21 points, LaMarcus Aldridge had 15 and Bryn Forbes 14. TIP-INS Blazers: Portland had an 11-man roster available, but coach Terry Stotts opted not to play Nassir Little or Gary Trent Jr. ... Former Spurs center Pau Gasol has not played this season for the Blazers as he continues to rehabilitate from left foot surgery in May. ... Bazemore finished with three points and three rebounds in 24 minutes before fouling out. Spurs: San Antonio has the fewest days with a losing record in the last 23 years, falling under .500 for 65 days. ... The Spurs will play on the road for the first time this season, taking on former San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers in Los Angeles on Thursday. STAYING PUT Popovich said Dejounte Murray's minutes will remain restricted after he missed last season following right ACL surgery in July 2018. Murray will not play in back-to-back games and will be limited to about five minutes per quarter. Murray had seven points and eight assists in 22 minutes against the Blazers. Popovich said he was not tempted to put Murray back in the game in the fourth quarter to help defensively as Lillard went on his 18-point run. ""No, he's on a minute restriction,"" Popovich said. ""Either he's on a minute restriction or he's not. One game isn't that important to put him out there when the docs feel he shouldn't be.""","401160690"
"PHOENIX --  Donovan Mitchell would have loved to end the game with some sort of highlight-reel dunk or step-back 3-pointer that would be replayed over and over again on television for the next 24 hours. But it wasn't that kind of night for the Utah Jazz. A physical drive, a drawn foul and a clutch free throw would have to do. Mitchell scored 25 points, including the game-winning foul shot with 0.4 seconds left, and the Jazz rallied to beat the Phoenix Suns 96-95 on Monday. ""It's me just attacking, coming downhill,"" Mitchell said. ""(Jevon) Carter was a great defender all game, but I just made a move and tried to get to the free throw line. I didn't do that much in the second half, but I did on the final play."" Mitchell took the ball in the backcourt in the final seconds and then drove through the lane past Carter, getting fouled by Devin Booker as he tried to make a layup. Mitchell sank the first free throw before missing the second, and Frank Kaminsky III's last-second heave was well short. Bojan Bogdanovic led the Jazz with 29 points on 8-of-13 shooting, including 4 for 8 from 3-point range. Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 18 rebounds and made 11 of 12 free throws. Utah won despite shooting just 38 percent from the field and committing 23 turnovers. The Jazz made up for it with good defense, especially in the final minutes. ""We didn't put our heads down after those mistakes. Got back and really worked to get stops,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""When you do that, you have a chance. We had some really big plays down the stretch."" The teams were tied at 70 heading into the fourth quarter before the Suns pushed ahead with five straight points. The game was tied again when Bogdanovic scored on a fast-break layup and was fouled with 1:45 left. He made the free throw to give the Jazz a 95-92 lead. Phoenix (2-2) was led by Booker's 21 points. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 and Carter had 15, including a 3-pointer that tied it at 95 with less than a minute left. Aron Baynes scored 12 for the Suns, including a career-high three 3-pointers. He made just 25 shots from beyond the arc in his first seven seasons, including 21 last year. Ricky Rubio faced Utah (3-1) for the first time since signing a free-agent deal with the Suns in the offseason. He finished with 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. ""I like how in the tough moments we get together and play with passion,"" Rubio said. ""The only difference not making the playoffs or making it is winning these kinds of games. I know we are young, we are learning, but we have to close out."" Both teams struggled to make shots in the first half as the Jazz built a 46-39 lead. Bogdanovic led Utah with 14 points. MORE THAN 0.4 SECONDS? Phoenix coach Monty Williams thought Mitchell got fouled with 1.8 seconds left instead of 0.4, which made it nearly impossible to get a last-second shot toward the rim. The call was not reviewed. Williams said that was frustrating, but it wasn't his team's biggest problem. ""That is a tough one to swallow but that wasn't the reason we lost,"" he said. ""Our ball movement was stagnant tonight."" TIP-INS Jazz: Dante Exum was out with a right knee injury. ... Utah outrebounded Phoenix 35-22 in the first half. ... Mitchell was called for a flagrant 1 foul in the third quarter after trying to fight around a screen by Baynes. Suns: Rubio returned after missing one game with a bruised left knee. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Jamal Murray took the blame for another slow start by Denver's offense and quickly pointed out how well the Nuggets have been playing defensively. ""Our defense has been our anchor,"" Murray said. ""It's been what's won us (games). Guys have to know we're a defensive team first. We can all score. We can all shoot. But defense is clearly how to win games."" Murray scored 14 points of his 18 points in the second half, including four in the final 31 seconds, Gary Harris added a pair of late free throws and the Nuggets held on after nearly blowing a big lead in the fourth quarter, beating the winless Sacramento Kings 101-94 on Monday night. The Nuggets (3-0) shook off a sluggish first half when they shot 17 of 52, took control in the third quarter with a stifling defense that repeatedly forced Sacramento into contested shots from the perimeter, then held off a late rally by the Kings to remain unbeaten. ""I challenged our guys to be a lot more physical and make them feel us,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""We didn't change our game plan. We just changed how hard and how physical we were playing. This was another night our offense struggled, but some guys stepped up and made big plays down the stretch."" Harris scored 17 points as Denver won its fifth straight against Sacramento. Nikola Jokic had nine points on 4-for-15 shooting with 13 rebounds and Will Barton added 13 points and nine rebounds. Denver led comfortably midway through the fourth quarter before Holmes scored five points as part of a 10-0 run that cut the Nuggets' lead to 90-88. Holmes later scored on a soaring one-handed dunk that made it 95-92, before Murray's deep shot just inside the 3-point line. After Barnes scored on a putback, Harris and Murray each hit two free throws. ""I came out more aggressive,"" said Murray, who missed five of his first six shots. ""That's something I have to change with myself from the jump. I can't just kind of be a part of the offense. I have to be aggressive and create for guys. That's what I did in the second half."" Richaun Holmes had 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Kings (0-4). De'Aaron Fox added 20 points and nine assists, and Harrison Barnes and Nemanja Bjelica each scored 12. First-year Sacramento coach Luke Walton felt his team made progress despite the loss, particularly defensively. ""That's what we have to be,"" Walton said. ""That's why we stress, and there was a point made, becoming a team that comes on defense so that when we have off shooting nights we still have a chance to win.  We really played a competitive game and we stuck together."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver outscored Sacramento 30-17 in the third quarter. ... Murray and Barton were a combined 2 of 12 in the first half when Denver shot 32.7% from the floor. Kings: The last time Sacramento started 0-4 was in 2008-09, when Reggie Theus was the coach. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard is only four games into his tenure back home in Los Angeles, and Paul George is still several games away from his Clippers debut. Everybody is still getting to know each other on this reconfigured roster. The Clippers have enough talent to keep stacking victories during this introductory process -- particularly against teams like the Charlotte Hornets, who have even more work to do. Leonard had 30 points, seven rebounds and six assists, and Lou Williams scored 23 points one day after his 33rd birthday in Los Angeles' 111-96 victory over Charlotte on Monday night. Montrezl Harrell scored eight of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, and Landry Shamet added 16 in the Clippers' third win in four games to start a season with championship aspirations. After following up their impressive season-opening victories over the Lakers and the Warriors with a shocking 130-122 loss to the Phoenix Suns two days ago, the Clippers managed to play enough defense in the second half to secure a comfortable win over the young Hornets. Their last two performances have been nowhere near complete, but the Clippers are working through it. ""There's so many things that we can get better in,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""And you just see them, like screening, timing, knowing where each other is at. There's so many new parts on the floor, and I just feel like we're nowhere near what we're going to be. Not even close, and that's a good thing. But during that time, you've still got to win games. You're in the West. You've just still got to tick off wins."" The Clippers pulled away with a 16-5 run spanning the final two quarters, stretching their lead to 96-79 with 7  1/2 minutes to play. Charlotte made an 11-2 surge, cutting the lead to single digits on Miles Bridges' 3-pointer with 4:16 left, but Harrell and Williams made big shots down the stretch. ""We've got to come in every game with a defensive hat on first, and we did that tonight,"" Leonard said. ""It's still early. We've got a long road ahead of us. We're still building chemistry, getting to know each other on the floor. I wouldn't say we're there yet. We've got to keep going."" Terry Rozier had 17 points to lead six Hornets scoring in double figures in the second game of a four-game trip. Devonte Graham had 14 points and 12 assists, while Cody Zeller added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte, which has lost three straight after a season-opening win over Chicago. ""I like the way we competed against two of the better teams in the league,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""We played even better tonight. Probably our best performance of the year defensively."" Indeed, Charlotte appeared to have more favorable defensive matchups against these Staples Center co-tenants than they did against the Lakers. But one night after the Hornets managed only 39 points in the second half of a loss to the Lakers, they scored only 42 in the second half against the Clippers. ""I feel like we're growing,"" Graham said. ""Even (against the Lakers), I feel like we took a step. We came out tonight to fight and be aggressive, but they did a good job on us in the second half."" RECENT EDGE The Clippers have won 10 straight over the Hornets at Staples Center since February 2009. Los Angeles has won 10 of its last 11 overall against Charlotte. KAWHI'S ASSISTS Leonard has added improved playmaking skills to his already formidable offensive arsenal since arriving in LA. Two days after setting a career high with 10 assists in Phoenix -- which surpassed his previous career high of nine, set two days before that against Golden State -- he had five in the first half against Charlotte, including a sublime bounce pass through traffic to Ivica Zubac shortly before halftime.

"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler made his first four shots and scored 21 in his Miami debut, rookie Tyler Herro scored 29 and the Heat defeated Atlanta 112-97 on Tuesday night in a game where Hawks star Trae Young left early in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle. The 19-year-old Herro had a 19-point second quarter for Miami, while fellow reserve Goran Dragic scored 21. Bam Adebayo had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Miami and Kendrick Nunn finished with 17.. Young left with 9:56 remaining in the first half, turning his ankle when he landed on the foot of Miami's Justise Winslow. The reigning Eastern Conference player of the week -- who had 102 points in Atlanta's first three games -- finished with five points in 11 minutes. John Collins scored 30 for Atlanta, including a career-best five 3-pointers, and Jabari Parker finished with 12 for the Hawks. Butler missed the first three games of the season while celebrating the birth of his daughter Rylee. He was 5 for 11 from the floor, and went 10 for 15 from the line. As a team, Miami was 33 for 45 from the line -- compared with 16 for 24 by Atlanta at the stripe. ""To win at home, in front of these fans, is special,"" Butler said. Even without Young, even with Kevin Huerter -- a starter last season -- on a minutes restriction while he works his way back off knee soreness and with Evan Turner out with a sore Achilles, the Hawks still wouldn't go away late. Tyrone Wallace made a pair of free throws to get Atlanta within 11 with 3:24 left, but the Hawks missed shots at the rim on their next two possessions and Miami put the game away. Herro set a Heat record for points off the bench by a rookie, topping the mark of 28 set by Michael Beasley on March 4, 2009. And Herro and Dragic became the ninth Heat duo all-time to have 20-point games off the Miami bench on the same night. TIP-INS Hawks: Vince Carter played in Miami for the 35th time, finishing with seven points and became the fourth visiting player to score 700 in road games against the Heat -- including playoffs. He now has 702 and joined Paul Pierce (867), Patrick Ewing (754) and Michael Jordan (722) in that club. ... Atlanta plays its next four games at home. Heat: Miami's 472 points through four games is a franchise-high. The previous high was 447 in 2012-13. ... Miami is 3-1 for the first time since the 2014-15 season.

"DENVER --  With their superstars held in check, the Dallas Mavericks relied on their supporting cast. They put on quite a show and helped hand Denver its first loss of the season. Maxi Kleber had 14 points, seven rebounds and a key block late, and Dallas overcame off nights from Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic to beat the Nuggets 109-106 on Tuesday night. Dallas had nine players score double figures, tying a franchise record, on a night their two top scorers combined for 22 points on 7 of 26 shooting. Doncic scored 12 points and Kristaps Porzingis had 10 points and 14 rebounds. No Mavericks player scored more than 14 points. ""It demonstrates the importance of having a deep roster,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Denver is very deep. We're deep and we're going to use our guys."" Doncic and Porzingis were also cold from deep, missing 12 of 14 from 3-point range. Porzingis was 1 for 8 and Doncic hit 1 of 6 and missed three free throws. ""We did a great job on those guys but the other guys got off,"" said Gary Harris, who shadowed Doncic most of the game. ""We can't allow that to happen. Those guys really hurt us today."" Nikola Jokic had his second triple-double of the season, with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and Paul Millsap had a season-high 23 points and eight rebounds. Will Barton scored 19 but it wasn't enough to prevent Denver from losing the second game of a back-to-back set. ""We couldn't get stops when we needed. Too many layups, too many broken assignments,"" Millsap said. ""We just weren't disciplined enough."" The Mavericks rallied from 11 down in the third quarter on the strength of their support players. They did most of their damage after Denver took a nine-point lead late in the third quarter. Tim Hardaway Jr., who finished with 14 points, hit three 3-pointers and Dorian Finney-Smith two during a 30-10 run that gave Dallas a 103-94 lead midway through the fourth quarter. The Nuggets chipped away at the lead and got within 107-106 on Harris' 3-pointer and appeared to take the lead with 1:05 left when Kleber was called for goaltending on Jamal Murray's layup. The officials quickly reviewed the play and overturned the call, keeping Dallas ahead 107-106. ""It's an automatic trigger; any goaltending in the last two minutes that's called is automatically reviewed,"" Carlisle said. ""It was pretty clear from my vantage point that it was going to be overturned."" Doncic hit a driving layup and Jokic lost the ball out of bounds with 29.2 seconds left. After Doncic missed two free throws Murray, who had 16 points, was hounded by Finney-Smith and missed everything on his 3-point attempt with 3.8 seconds left. ""I knew he was looking for a 3 so if he was going to get a shot off I just wanted it to be contested,"" Finney-Smith said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic took a shot to the side midway through the first quarter when he collided with Gary Harris going or a loose ball. He was bent over before a timeout but stayed in the game. ... C Dwight Powell made his season debut after missing the first three games with a left hamstring strain. He finished with four points in 13:34 of action. Nuggets: Millsap's previous season high was 11. He had that many in the first 3:34 of the game. ... Denver was 12-1 in the second of back-to-back games last season. BIG EASY Kleber finished with three blocks and one steal to go along with his 14 points. ""Kleber catches people by surprise because they don't see him and all of a sudden he's blocking a shot,"" Carlisle said. ""Sometimes it can elicit a whistle that blown by a referee who has never seen something like that before."" Kleber has earned the respect of his teammates. ""He's a great defender,"" Doncic said. ""He can do a lot of things. It wasn't just that play.""","401160695"
"LOS ANGELES --  Anthony Davis is four games into his first season with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he's already in good company. Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, George Mikan, Shaquille O'Neal -- and now AD. Davis had the fourth 40-point, 20-rebound game of his seven-year career and set a franchise record with 26 made free throws as the Lakers rallied in the second half for a convincing 120-91 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. He joined those Laker greats as LA players to get 40 points and 20 rebounds. ""It's an honor to be on that list with those legends but more important is we got the win,"" said Davis, who was 26 of 27 from the line. ""It was a grind in the first half and my teammates trusted me. I just tried to be a monster on the glass."" It is Davis' first 40-20 game since 2016. He's the first Laker to do it since O'Neal in 2003. Davis played only 31 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he is the first player to have a 40-20 game in 31 minutes or less since 1954-55. Prior to Davis, the quickest 40-20 game was 33 minutes by Baylor in 1961. Davis is also the fourth player in league history and first since Michael Jordan in 1987 to make 26 or more free throws. ""This solidifies why we went out and got him. He was big time for us,"" said LeBron James, who scored 23 points for the Lakers. Los Angeles is off to its first 3-1 start since winning its first eight in 2010. Davis was questionable two hours before the game due to a right shoulder injury suffered in Sunday's win over Charlotte. He did some dribbling and shooting on the court before being cleared. Davis had 16 points and nine rebounds in the first quarter but went back to the locker room at the start of the second to get the shoulder checked and re-taped. Coach Frank Vogel thought he might have to go the rest of the game without Davis until he saw him come back to the bench. ""He gutted it out playing in some pain and was dominant. They didn't have an answer and he was terrific,"" Vogel said. Los Angeles trailed for most of the first half but took a 49-47 lead into the locker room at halftime when Davis grabbed a rebound, drove down the court and tipped in his own miss at the buzzer. The Grizzlies (1-3) led 65-59 with seven minutes remaining in the third quarter when the Lakers went on a 27-2 run to close out the quarter. Davis scored 16 points during the rally, with all but two coming at the line. The final 10 Lakers' points in the quarter came via Davis' free throws. ""Everyone was playing well,"" Davis said. ""I was just trying to be aggressive. It was a close game until the third quarter. I knew some of their players were in foul trouble and tried to get them out of the game. "" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins agreed with Davis' sentiment, saying ""I thought he was super aggressive, and you are rewarded when you are aggressive."" Davis said his shoulder was still sore after the game, but he thinks it will improve since the Lakers have a couple days off. Memphis raced to a 15-2 lead before Los Angeles started to work its way back. Ja Morant led the Grizzlies with 16 points, and Jonas Valanciunas added 14 points and 11 boards. Morant, who was the second pick in the June draft, had only three points in the first half before finding his groove in the second. ""Coming into an environment like this we have to play all four quarters,"" Morant said. ""It was wow moment coming in (facing James and Davis) but I was still trying to go out and play my game."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis finished 22 of 23 from the line but was 7 of 34 on 3-pointers. ... Grayson Allen came off the bench to score 13 points. ... Dillon Brooks' four-point play early in the first quarter was the third of his career. That ties him with Shane Battier and Troy Daniels for second in franchise history behind Mike Conley's seven. Lakers: Avery Bradley had 12 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 11, with all but one coming in the fourth quarter. ... Los Angeles finished 33 of 39 on free throws.","401160696"
"CLEVELAND -- A year after losing their first six games, the Cleveland Cavaliers are putting a scare into other people during the first week of this season. Kevin Love, who had 17 points and 20 rebounds in Cleveland's 117-111 over Chicago on Wednesday night, went with the Halloween theme while sitting at his locker talking to reporters following the game. Love donned a hockey mask in honor of Jason, the evil character from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. He also arrived at the arena before the game wearing the mask. ""I know my scary movies,"" said Love. ""That's my favorite scary movie."" Cleveland, which has split its first four games didn't get its second win until its 13th game last season. Love and Tristan Thompson, who had 23 points 10 rebounds, have had double-doubles in each of Cleveland's four games. ""We're just feeding off each other,"" Love said. ""We talk every day that we need to set the tone for the rest of the team."" Love's basket on a goal-tending call on Lauri Markkanen gave Cleveland a 91-90 lead early in the tightly played fourth quarter. His jumper from the left wing put the Cavaliers ahead 110-106 with just under a minute to play. Collin Sexton, who sat most of the third quarter because of foul trouble, scored 10 points in the final eight minutes, including a dunk over Chicago center Wendell Carter Jr. following an assist from Love on Cleveland's next possession. Cleveland's first-year coach John Beilein's goal to establish a homecourt advantage for his rebuilding team is off to a good start. The Cavaliers won their home opener over Indiana and rallied to beat the Bulls. ""We talked about that today,"" Beilein said. ""We want it to be special for us. The goal always is to win at home. We want to continue that trend to have people watch us grow."" Sexton had 18 points, a day after the Cavaliers exercised his third-year contract option. Markkanen and Zach LaVine each scored 16 points for Chicago, which has lost three straight. Carter and Otto Porter Jr. added 15 apiece. The Bulls, who allowed 15 consecutive points in the fourth quarter of Monday's loss to New York, saw another game get away. ""As the game went on, their energy grew and ours didn't,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""They drove it at us and they rebounded us and brought the physicality you need in the fourth quarter. We battled, but we haven't played as well in key moments as I hoped they would."" Chicago went on a 15-0 run to take a 21-11 lead in the first quarter, but led only 53-50 at halftime. Sexton picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter and sat out most of the period. Cleveland hit five 3-pointers, including three by Cedi Osman. Jordan Clarkson was fouled while making a 3-pointer from the corner and converted the free throw. TIP-INS Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison (strained left hamstring), who is rehabilitating his injury with the G-League's Windy City Bulls, will rejoin the team Thursday in order to gauge his progress. ... C Cristiano Felicio was a healthy inactive for the fifth straight game. He is the only player on the roster not to play a minute this season. Cavaliers: Love tied a franchise record for rebounds in a half with 16 in the first two quarters. ... Rookie G Dylan Windler has increased his activity as he returns from a stress reaction in his lower left leg that occurred before training camp. Windler, taken with the 26th pick of the first round, is shooting and participating in on-court drills. MAJOR SLAM Sexton, who is listed at 6-foot-1, dunked over the 6-10 Carter during Cleveland's spurt that clinched the game, a highlight that surely will be replayed countless times. ""I was going to try and lay it in and I thought, I might as well dunk it,"" Sexton said. TIME TO WIN Carter started and played 27 minutes, despite waking up in the morning with eye inflammation. ""You hear people talking about us being a playoff team, but that's all people hollering about something that's really far away,"" he said after the Bulls fell to 1-4. ""We need to focus on winning the next game.""","401160697"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic's shooting woes continue early in the season. So has their dogged defense. Nikola Vucevic scored 21 points and had 14 rebounds and Aaron Gordon scored 10 of his 15 points in the final five minutes of the game to help Orlando beat New York 95-83 on Wednesday night to end a two-game losing streak. Evan Fournier added 14 points, Jonathan Isaac had 10 and Orlando finished on a 16-3 run. The Magic limited New York to just one basket and one free throw in the final eight minutes to rally from an 80-79 deficit. Orlando allowed the Knicks just one of 11 shooting and forced three turnovers in that game-deciding stretch. ""We're trying to find our way offensively, but I do believe we had great defensive talent on this roster,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Through these first 10-12 games, we can defend and compete our way through until we get our offense going. That's what we did tonight."" The defense was very much needed. Orlando, the worst shooting team in the NBA going into the game, had a nice run in the third quarter -- hitting 13 of 20 shots -- but the rest of the game was a struggle. Gordon had only five points when he nailed a 3-pointer that ignited the Magic's fourth quarter rally. After a Vucevic layup, Gordon drilled another 3-pointer, a follow shot and capped the run with a reverse dunk. It was his most impressive offensive stretch in the young season. ""It was part of the process of getting to the open spots, being in the right place and trusting my teammates,"" Gordon said. ""They made great passes that allowed me to shoot the shots in rhythm."" Julius Randle led New York with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Mitchell Robinson had 12 points, all in the first half, and Bobby Portis added 12. The Knicks withstood Orlando's offensive surge in the third quarter by scoring the last 10 points of the period. New York, which trailed by 15 at one point in the quarter, erased the last of that deficit when Portis hit a 3-pointer to put the Knicks up 80-79 with 8:05 left in the game. However, there wasn't much offense to talk about after that. ""Two things happened in the fourth quarter: we didn't come up with loose balls and the ball stopped moving,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""It was a trust factor. In tight situations, you've got to share the ball. When the ball stops moving for us, it's death."" The Magic, who have struggled with their shooting in every game, entered the game last in the NBA in shooting percentage, lived down to that reputation in the first half, hitting just 15 of 45 shots. No Magic player reached double figures in the first half, but New York couldn't make them pay for it. The Knicks, playing without their two top point guards, Dennis Smith Jr. and Elfrid Payton, got an unexpected 12 points from Robinson in the first half, but not much else from his teammates. New York did take a 44-42 into halftime. TIP INS Knicks: F Marcus Morris had four blocked shots in the first half. ... F Julius Randle has a double-double in every game this season. Magic: Orlando hasn't scored 100 points in a game this season. ... The Magic outrebounded the Knicks 52-44. ... The Magic limited New York to just 26.3 percent shooting (5 of 19) in the fourth quarter. LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN Frank Ntilikina was the only point guard available for the Knicks Wednesday, but Coach David Fizdale declined to start him because he said was afraid Ntilikina would get in foul trouble. Ntilikina, who hadn't scored in 25 minutes this season, came in at the 5:29 mark of the first quarter and hit three of his first four shots, including a 32-footer at the buzzer.  However, he didn't make another shot the rest of the game. He finished with two personal fouls.","401160698"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns got into a brawl that overshadowed a rout on the court. Embiid scored 19 points before he was ejected for fighting with Towns, and the Philadelphia 76ers cruised to a 117-95 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night for their fourth straight win to begin the season. The Sixers were leading 75-55 midway through the third quarter when Embiid and Towns went at it. The two big men have a history of talking trash to each other. After they got tangled under the basket, Embiid shoved Towns, who answered with a punch that missed as both men fell to the floor. Ben Simmons jumped in and forcefully held Towns down as other players and coaches ran onto the court to separate everyone. ""I didn't throw any punches, so I shouldn't get suspended,"" Embiid said. Embiid and Towns were tossed after a video review. ""We deemed the altercation a fight. Therefore, by rule, they're both ejected,"" said Mark Ayotte, the officials' crew chief. ""I just saw them each lock arms. And that escalated to the fight."" Embiid shadowboxed to the crowd's delight on his way back to the locker room. Fans responded with ""MVP!"" chants. ""I was built for this city,"" Embiid said. ""The love they have for me, I can't thank them enough. I appreciate all the love. That reaction was probably the loudest I ever heard them. That's what the city of Philadelphia is all about. You gotta come in here, you gotta fight, you gotta play hard, you gotta be gritty, you gotta be a Broad Street Bully. We're gonna keep on fighting and try to accomplish the goal we have set for us."" Towns downplayed the fight. ""It's a competitive game. As a team, we need to play better with our system. We didn't execute our game plan,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed in the (loss). I don't think we played our game. We were playing a different type of basketball. It wasn't what got us to 3-0. We can learn a lot from this game."" Embiid said the fight ""happened out of nowhere,"" but added: ""I like to get in people's mind."" Sixers coach Brett Brown said he's not concerned that Embiid will receive a suspension. ""I don't see punches being thrown (by Embiid) and I don't believe he was the instigator,"" Brown said. Both teams entered 3-0. The Spurs, at 3-0, are the only other unbeaten team in the NBA. Andrew Wiggins scored 19 points, Towns had 13 points and former Sixer Robert Covington had seven for the Timberwolves. Tobias Harris scored 18 points, Furkan Korkmaz had 17 off the bench and Simmons added 16 for Philadelphia. Al Horford grabbed 16 rebounds to go with 12 points. Minnesota led 11-9 midway through the first quarter before Harris hit a 3-pointer. Harris followed with a driving layup and Philadelphia led the rest of the way. Embiid punctuated a dominant first half with a 3 to put the Sixers up 63-42 going into the break. ""It's competitive, we knew it was going to be that way,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. BACK TO AI The Sixers haven't been 4-0 since Allen Iverson led them to the NBA Finals in the 2001-02 season. SIGHTINGS New Phillies manager Joe Girardi sat courtside in the first half. ... Eagles rookie running back Miles Sanders rang the bell and teammates Carson Wentz, Alshon Jeffery and several other players watched from a suite.

"BOSTON --  The Bucks exploited gaps in the Celtics' defense on their way to beating Boston in five games last season in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Celtics used a balanced, barrage of offense to return the favor in their first matchup this season. Kemba Walker had 21 of his 32 points in the second half and Boston rallied to beat Milwaukee 116-105 on Wednesday night. Jayson Tatum added 25 points, Gordon Hayward had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Marcus Smart finished with 19 points and six assists. Boston shot 54% from the field over the final two quarters. ""We've got so many talented guys on this team everybody should be chipping in to be the team we want to be,"" Tatum said. Milwaukee dominated in the first half, leading by 19 at one point. But the Celtics responded in the third quarter, using a 26-7 run over the final 6:38 of the period to take an 80-76 edge into the fourth. ""They got going pretty good,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Kemba's a great player, but they played through Hayward a little bit. Tatum made some big shots, tough shots. They mixed and matched well -- those three tonight."" Boston kept that momentum, beginning the final period with an 11-4 run to open a 91-80 lead. ""I think it started on the defensive end,"" Hayward said. ""We kept getting stops, our energy picked up and that kind of turned it around for us in the second half."" Khris Middleton led the Bucks with 26 points. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points and 14 rebounds, but the reigning MVP lost his composure late, first picking up a hard foul on Smart and then a technical foul in the final minute. Antetokounmpo said there was no malicious intent on the play with Smart. ""Nothing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I tried to go for the rebound. He tried to go for the rebound. Two guys that play hard and we both ended up on the floor."" The Celtics started Daniel Theis at center and the defensive-minded Smart at guard with Jaylen Brown out with an illness and Enes Kanter sidelined for the third straight game with a bruised left knee. It did little to stop the much bigger Bucks front line from getting in the paint early on as Milwaukee sliced through Boston's interior and hit nine 3-pointers on their way to a 58-42 halftime lead TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo had his third straight double-double. ... Milwaukee had a 37-8 edge in bench scoring. Celtics: Walker, Tatum and Hayward were a combined 7 of 26 from the field in the first half. AIR MAIL Antetokounmpo airballed a pair of free throws with 1:46 left in the second quarter, igniting a chorus of cheers from the home crowd. But Antetokounmpo, who entered the night shooting just 54 percent from the line, bounced back at the end of the half by connecting on all three of his free throw attempts after being fouled by Smart with one second to play. FIRST IMPRESSION One of the memories that still stands out for Celtics coach Brad Stevens about serving as Eastern Conference All-Star Game coach in 2017 is what Antetokounmpo -- then a first-time All-Star -- told him before the game. ""I remember him telling me, `I'm going to play hard,"" Stevens recalled. ""I'm like, `You might be one of a few.' But that's the deal, right? He just plays really hard."" Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, six rebounds, three steals and a block that night.","401160700"
"NEW YORK --  Domantas Sabonis and the Indiana Pacers finally got their first victory of the season. Sabonis scored 29 points, Jeremy Lamb added 25 and Indiana Pacers beat the Brooklyn Nets 118-108 on Wednesday night for their first victory in five games. ""(Sabonis) was a monster down there,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Just defending, rebounding, initiating offense. Had to play a lot of minutes, but was fired up and I thought we rode his energy."" Sabonis carried the frontcourt load when Myles Turner left the game after spraining his right ankle in the first quarter. ""It's tough,"" Sabonis said about losing Turner. ""Because it's the beginning of the season, we're also trying to find each other and find that chemistry and play together, and obviously he's going to be out for a little bit. It's tough. I wish him a speedy recovery. When he comes back he's going to help us, he's the best defender in the league."" Malcolm Brogdon added 21 points and 13 assists for Indiana. Kyrie Irving led Brooklyn with 28 points, Spencer Dinwiddie had 20 and Caris LeVert 15. The Nets have lost two in a row to fall to 1-3. ""We're not really running anything (on offense),"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""In training camp you're practicing a lot, but you have a nice flow, you kind of know what you're doing. I think we've lost a little bit of our structure and organization, which is natural with a new team and new guys."" The Pacers took their largest lead at 112-96 on Brogdan's 3-pointer with 4:43 remaining. Indiana took a 90-83 lead into the fourth quarter, with Sabonis and Lamb each scoring seven points in the third. With three new starters in Irving, DeAndre Jordan and Taurean Prince, the Nets have become more of an isolation team than the cohesive group from a season ago. ""Basketball has a way of being sequentially sound or it can be sequentially off completely,"" Irving said. ""Be able to weather the storm out there. Some possessions are not going to be perfect. We want to limit the mistakes out there where you have opportunities to attack the basket, shoot threes and get everyone confident. Wins and losses come and go. It just gives us a chance to dive into practice and really take it day by day. The details are really what separates the good and the bad teams in the league.""

""I feel comfortable,"" Siakam said. ""The more I get in situations like that, the more comfortable I get. Just having the coach trust me to have the ball in my hands, and my teammates also, it feels good."" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Siakam is becoming ""a prime-time scorer.""

Lillard had 23 points and 13 assists to help the Portland Trail Blazers hold off Oklahoma City 102-99 on Wednesday night. In last year's first-round playoff matchup between the teams, Lillard's deep 3-pointer over Paul George won Game 5 and the series.

Lillard rested to start the final period and mapped out his strategy. ""The whole time I was sitting on the bench, I knew I was going to come in and try to keep it in my hands a little bit more and try to impose my will on the game a little bit more,"" he said. ""And it worked out."" The Trail Blazers led the rest of the way. The Thunder have been competitive in their losses, but they haven't had a scorer like Lillard step up at critical moments to get them over the top. ""I was telling the guys postgame that's why guys get paid the big bucks -- to make big shots like that in the fourth quarter,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""Dame got it going."" C.J. McCollum scored 22 points and Kent Bazemore added 14 for the Trail Blazers. Paul scored 21 points, Dennis Schroder scored 17 and Nerlens Noel added 15 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder. Portland led 49-44 at halftime. The Trail Blazers shot 38.1% in the first half while the Thunder shot 35%. Lillard made just 2 of 8 shots in the first half and scored seven points. A 3-pointer by Paul tied the game at 53 early in the third quarter, and then he made a jumper to put the Thunder ahead by two. The Thunder took a 69-68 lead into the final period. Diallo grabbed three offensive rebounds on one possession before finally scoring to put the Thunder up 79-76, and Mike Muscala's layup on an assist from Paul put the Thunder up by five before the Trail Blazers rallied. ""It was an ugly game,"" Lillard said. ""Both teams turned it over, missing shots, a lot of bad possessions, low-scoring. So you knew it was going to come to the last five, six minutes."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Held the Thunder to 27.8% shooting in the first quarter to take a 24-17 lead. ... C Hassan Whiteside left the game late in the second quarter after injuring his left knee. He later returned. He finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds. ... McCollum made just 7 of 22 shots. Thunder: C Steven Adams sat out with a left knee contusion. Coach Billy Donovan said Adams will be re-evaluated on Thursday. ... Muscala made 2 of 9 shots and scored four points. ... G Hamidou Diallo had a career-high 10 rebounds to go with 12 points. STAT LINES The Thunder made just 4 of 27 3-point attempts and shot 39.3% overall. Danilo Gallinari made 3 of 9 3s, and the rest of the team made 1 of 18. ""We're getting great shots,"" Paul said. ""That's the thing. Sharing the ball isn't a problem for us. If that was a problem, I'd be worried. Shots are going to start falling, so we've just got to keep playing the way we're playing."" QUOTABLE Lillard on his late assist to Rodney Hood for a 3-pointer: ""Sometimes, we're going to be able to have success when I'm making shots, taking over, when I'm the one scoring the ball. But I think it'll go further and it will be stronger and we'll be able to do it more often when we trust in each other making that extra pass and guys are in that situation where they get an opportunity to take and make a big shot.""","401160704"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Utah Jazz had to kick Mike Conley out of the gym Wednesday morning. Conley kept shooting until the coaching staff pleaded for him to ""save something for the game."" Turns out, he had plenty left. Conley snapped an early season slump with 29 points and the Jazz beat the Los Angeles Clippers 110-96 on Wednesday night with Kawhi Leonard sitting out. ""I just wanted to get back to who I am,"" Conley said. ""I hit one, hit two and could feel going. I felt the energy from the crowd and my teammates and said, yes, this is the game."" Conley had 18 points in the third quarter as the Jazz scored 40 in the period and took a 90-71 lead. Utah (4-1) has won three in a row. Leonard missed the game for scheduled rest, though coach Doc Rivers has said his star forward has been healthy and energized. The Clippers play the second half of a back-to-back Thursday against San Antonio in Los Angeles. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points, Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 and Rudy Gobert 13. But, collectively, the Jazz were determined to get Conley on track. ""Just trying to get Mike open,"" Gobert said. ""He did a great job reading the defense and making all the shots, driving the lane."" Lou Williams paced the Clippers (3-2) with 24 points, 16 before halftime. The matchup of one of the league's top defenses against one of the top offenses lost some its luster without Leonard, but the Jazz showed how potent they could be with 55 percent shooting while holding their opponents below 100 points for the fifth straight game. ""Our guys take pride on the defensive end,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We were better on the ball, in pursuit of the ball handlers and got some contests (in the third quarter)."" JaMychal Green, who had 23 points, led his fellow Clipper reserves in a fourth-quarter rally, cutting a 23-point edge to 99-89. Conley responded with a 3-pointer and a lob to Gobert for a dunk. ""Second half, they made some tough shots,"" Patrick Beverly said. ""They made the shots that we wanted them to take."" Conley struggled in his first four games with Utah after playing 12 years in Memphis, including a 1-for-16 shooting performance in the opener and an 0-for-7 outing in the last game. In recent days, he admitted it has taken more time than he expected to feel comfortable with the Jazz plays and terminology. ""As much as I tried not to, I was pressing. I have to say some doubt crept in. It was consuming,"" Conley said. When Conley hit a 3-pointer and followed it with a tough layup high off the backboard in third quarter, he pumped his fist and yelled to the rafters. When Los Angeles called timeout, the entire Jazz bench leaped off the bench and ran onto the court to greet the point guard. ""It's a big relief and I've really wanted to start playing like I'm used to. I hope this is the beginning of the positive Mike,"" Conley said. A few minutes later, Conley hit a high-arcing 3-pointer and motioned for the crowd to get louder. Cheers rang out and then turned into chants of ""Con-ley, Con-ley, Con-ley"". ""I've never experienced that before in 13 years of playing basketball. It was special and I could tell the crowd was feeling like I was, just waiting and had a lot of energy built up,"" Conley said. After just nine made field goals in his first four games, Conley made 11 of 17 shots, including five 3-pointers, and had five assists with a season-low two turnovers. ""Mike's a pretty calm guy but when he was screaming and yelling, once we saw that, we were feeding of it,"" Mitchell said. The Jazz were hot from the start and led by 14 points early in the second quarter. The Clippers trimmed the advantage to 52-51 at halftime. TIP INS Clippers: Williams, who has won the Sixth Man of the Year award a record three times, started the game. ""Lou has no problem starting or coming off the bench,"" Rivers said. ... LA had 20 turnovers. ... Rivers lamented not having Leonard and Paul George, who continues his rehabilitation: ""Having guys back at home. That's a lot of points sitting out of the game for us."" ... Rookie Terrance Mann scored the first points of his career and finished with four points and five assists. Jazz: Dante Exum is still inactive as he recovers from knee surgery. ... Utah had a season-high 13 steals. ... Gobert had two blocks and reached 900 rejections in his career.","401160705"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  P.J. Washington controlled the post well enough to keep Charlotte close until the rest of his teammates found their rhythm. The Hornets rookie showed some versatility, too, when he stepped out and made a pair of shots beyond the arc. Washington scored 23 points to lead seven Charlotte players in double figures and the Hornets rallied from 14 down to beat the winless Sacramento Kings 118-111 on Wednesday night. ""I thought he imposed his will on that game immediately when he stepped on the floor,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""Right now we have a young man that has that potential to go down in the post and play out in the perimeter. That's a very complete young man."" The 12th overall pick in the draft, Washington has been everything the Hornets hoped for, particularly playing center when Borrego goes with his small lineup. Washington's perimeter shooting has provided an equally big boost. He had two 3s against the Kings and is shooting 13 of 25 beyond the arc through five games. ""I'm shooting it with confidence,"" Washington said. ""If I have an open look I'm definitely taking it. If you don't have a hand up I'm shooting it."" Terry Rozier had 22 points, six assists and five rebounds for Charlotte, which hadn't won since beating Chicago in the season-opener. The Hornets set a franchise-record with 23 3-pointers against the Bulls and had another big night beyond the arc against Sacramento, going 16 of 32. Cody Zeller added 12 points and 15 rebounds for Charlotte (2-3) while Malik Monk scored 18. Buddy Hield scored 23 points and Harrison Barnes had 22 for the Kings. Sacramento (0-5) is off to its worst start since 1990-91 when the Kings lost their first seven on the way to a 25-57 record. ""We have to punch back,"" said Sacramento's Richaun Holmes, who started at center as part of coach Luke Walton's attempt to shake the Kings out of their funk. ""Teams are going to make runs and we haven't responded, especially in the third quarter. We get punched. We have to be ready to respond."" The Hornets trailed 49-35 midway through the second quarter but closed within 66-61 at halftime, then took control in the third quarter. Rozier, Monk and Miles Bridges each made two 3-pointers, and Devonte Graham added a pair of free throws that made it 93-84. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum (broken middle finger) missed his third straight game after being hurt in the opener. Batum, who is expected to miss 3-4 weeks, has been able to practice while wearing a protective splint. Kings: De'Aaron Fox had 16 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. ... Sacramento's 14-point lead in the second quarter was its biggest of the season. The Kings had not led by more than 11 in its first four games. ... Marvin Bagley III (right thumb fracture) and Harry Giles (left knee soreness) did not play. HOLMES EARNS START Holmes has been Sacramento's most active player this season, which led coach Luke Walton to start him for the first time this season in place of 7-foot center Dewayne Dedmon. It paid off, as Holmes scored 11 of his 17 points in the first half. Holmes also had seven rebounds. GOING DEEP The Hornets made eight 3-pointers in the third quarter -- one more than they had in the first half. WILD THING Charlotte guard Dwayne Bacon attempted a cross-court pass that sailed three rows into the stands in the third quarter.","401160706"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  In what has already been a rough start to the season for the Warriors, now Stephen Curry is down. A two-time MVP, Golden State's longest-tenured player and its oldest at age 31. The heart and soul of his team. Curry broke his left hand and became the latest injured Warriors player when he fell hard in the third quarter of another embarrassing defeat by Golden State, 121-110 to the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. A CT scan will determine whether Curry needs surgery, the Warriors said. ""I just feel bad for him,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""When these guys who are the faces of the league go down it's not good for the league, but especially someone like Steph, who's done so much to raise the level of excitement here in the Bay Area and throughout the league."" Curry drove to his left defended by Kelly Oubre Jr. and with big man Aron Baynes standing solidly in the paint. Curry leapt with the ball then came down head first landing awkwardly on his hands to brace himself from the court, with Baynes crashing onto Curry's left hand. Curry grimaced in pain grabbing at his fingers then walked to the locker room with 8:31 left in the third quarter. ""Aron Baynes came up after the game and just wanted to know how Steph was doing,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""You could tell he felt really bad. It's just a random basketball play, so stuff happens."" Baynes had 24 points, 12 rebounds seven assists and three blocked shots, Devin Booker scored 31 points as the Suns jumped out to a huge lead they never relinquished. The Warriors have lost badly in their first two home games at sparkling new Chase Center. The ailing, undermanned Warriors welcomed back two players but still fell behind 39-11 shooting 4 for 17 as the Suns made 14 of their first 23 shots and 8 of 12 3-pointers. Curry had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting before getting hurt. Losing Curry for an extended period would be a huge blow for a young Warriors team. ""Of course it hurts knowing that Steph Curry's down,"" said rookie Eric Paschall, who made his first career start and scored a team-high 20 points. ""... That's a very, very valuable piece of our team but I feel like we're going to stay positive."" Golden State is struggling to start the season with Kevin Durant's departure to Brooklyn and Klay Thompson out for perhaps the entire season recovering from July 2 surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee. This was another rough one after an embarrassing season opener in the first game at Chase Center, a 141-122 loss to the Clippers last Thursday that saw some fans leaving after the third quarter. Golden State returned home with a 1-2 record and amid a stretch with five games over seven days and two back-to-backs. The Warriors trailed 72-46 at halftime Wednesday after falling behind 70-37 at the break in Oklahoma City on Sunday. Golden State center Willie Cauley-Stein, who missed all of training camp with a sprain in his left foot, had 12 points and five rebounds in his Golden State debut. He checked in for the first time at the 8:23 mark of the first quarter. LGBTQ NIGHT The Warriors held LGBTQ Night with a panel following the game featuring Golden State COO Rick Welts -- the first openly gay NBA executive -- WNBA and Olympic champion Sue Bird of the Seattle Storm and her partner, Megan Rapinoe, of the World Cup-winning U.S. women's soccer team. Kerr tried to connect with Rapinoe over the summer to have her speak to the World Cup basketball team he coached that went to China. It didn't work out but he hoped to get a few minutes with her Wednesday. ""She's such an incredible athlete and advocate and Sue has been one of the best women's players in the game for a long time,"" Kerr said. ""I know Rick is close with both of them so it's important I think, especially on a night like tonight where we're celebrating the idea of being accepting of everyone, it's great to have them here."" The women also spoke to members of the Warriors organization earlier in the day. Bird and the U.S. women's basketball team play at Stanford on Saturday. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix beat Golden State for just the third time in the last 21 regular-season meetings. ... The Suns' 115-111 win at Golden State on March 10 this year snapped an 18-game losing streak to the Warriors and a 14-game road skid in the series. ... Suns assistant coach Willie Green spent the past three years with the Warriors. Warriors: Kerr said F Kevon Looney, who missed his fourth straight game because of a right hamstring injury, is scheduled to be evaluated early next week by a team of specialists because of an ""on-going presence of a neuropathic condition in his body, which has a direct correlation to his recent injury."" Looney is limited to controlled workouts with the training staff for now. ""He's frustrated and we're frustrated for him,"" Kerr said. ... Alec Burks, who missed all five preseason games and the first three of the regular season, also returned for the Warriors and scored seven points in his first game with Golden State. ...

"ATLANTA --  Kendrick Nunn is enjoying the best start of any undrafted player in NBA history. The rookie is taking the Miami Heat along for the ride. Nunn scored a career-high 28 points to add to his record-setting start and Miami beat Atlanta 106-97 on Thursday night, giving the Heat two wins over the Hawks in three days. Nunn's 112 points are the highest total through the first five games for any undrafted player in NBA history. Connie Hawkins of the Phoenix Suns scored 105 points in his first five games of the 1969-70 season. ""It's surreal a little bit,"" Nunn said. ""... All I needed was the opportunity."" Nunn, a 6-foot-2 guard from Oakland University in Michigan, scored 14 points in the third quarter. He began his career with 24 points against Memphis on Oct. 23, and he has kept shooting. He has scored at least 24 points three times in Miami's first five games. ""He can shoot it,"" Hawks rookie Cam Reddish said. ""I have a lot of respect for that guy."" Another record-setting rookie, Tyler Herro, had 17 points. Herro scored 29 points off the bench in the Heat's 112-97 win over Atlanta on Tuesday night to set a franchise record for a rookie reserve. The rookies have helped Miami (4-1) enjoy a strong start. Nunn and Herro are feeding off Jimmy Butler, who had 11 assists while scoring only five points. He added nine rebounds, six steals and blocked three shots. The Heat had 29 assists with only 13 turnovers. ""To tell you the truth, that was winning basketball today,"" Butler said. Nunn was impressed by Butler's play, especially the assists. ""That's huge, for your star player to be unselfish like that,"" Nunn said. Butler had 21 points in his Heat debut on Tuesday night, but said he doesn't have to score big to do his job. ""I'm not here to score 50 points or whatever. ... If we win, I'm good."" Reddish filled in at point guard for Trae Young, who was held out with a sprained right ankle. Jabari Parker led Atlanta with 23 points. DeAndre Bembry had 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Miami held a lead of 18 points, but Atlanta made a late comeback attempt. Bembry's steal and basket cut Miami's lead to 94-88 midway through the final period. Following a timeout, Meyers Leonard sank two 3-pointers for Miami, followed by a Nunn layup, for a 102-88 lead. Leonard had 16 points. Reddish had nine points with four assists and only one turnover. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said Reddish had a good start before crossing the ""fine line between playing with good pace and playing too fast."" Reddish, who joined De'Andre Hunter as rookie starters, said ""I feel like I learned a lot tonight, especially at that position. I've got to slow down and let the game come to me."" TIP-INS Heat: F Justise Winslow (lower back stiffness) did not play. ... The Heat took the lead with a string of 3-pointers late in the opening period, including Bam Adebayo's fourth career 3 and first of the season. ... Coach Erik Spoelstra made a successful challenge of a charge call against Adebayo in the second period. ... Miami made 14 of 37 3s, including four of six by Nunn. Hawks: Young, who suffered the injury on Tuesday night, did not appear to be limping when seen walking before the game. ...

"NEW ORLEANS --  The New Orleans Pelicans' matchup against Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets looked troublesome on paper, yet a stunning performance by Jahlil Okafor lifted the Pelicans to their first win of the young season. Okafor scored 26 points, Brandon Ingram added 25 and the Pelicans beat the Nuggets 122-107 on Thursday night as New Orleans claimed it first victory in five games. The Pelicans' defensive performance -- particularly against Jokic, the reigning first-team All-NBA center -- helped them end their early-season struggles in which they allowed at least 123 points in each of the first four games. ""More so than anything, I thought we were locked in defensively,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I thought we did a really good job, especially on Jokic."" Jokic finished with 13 points, six assists and six rebounds for a Nuggets team that has now lost two straight after a 3-0 start. ""I thought our starting group struggled; I thought they were low energy,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""We were lucky to be down by four at halftime, and they come out and punch us in the mouth to start that third quarter. I thought tonight was a disappointing, embarrassing effort."" Okafor scored 20 points in the second half, and the fifth-year center went to the free-throw line a career-high 13 times, making 10. Ingram has scored at least 22 points in each of his first five games for New Orleans after coming over from the Los Angeles Lakers. The Pelicans led the final three quarters. They made four of their first five shots in the third quarter to take a 10-point lead, and Denver struggled to recover. New Orleans' best defensive performance of the season came after a listless wire-to-wire loss to the Golden State Warriors on Monday. ""We got killed the other day in film after that bad performance against Golden State, but it was necessary,"" Okafor said. ""It was much needed, and we were able to fix the things that we talked about."" Jrue Holiday added 19 points and seven assists after missing the previous two games because of a sprained left knee sprain. Frank Jackson had 21 points on 8-of-10 shooting, and Gentry said Jackson's improvement is a related to his offseason workouts with Holiday. ""He seems to get better the more time he spends around Jrue,"" Gentry said. Michael Porter Jr. led the Nuggets with 15 points in his NBA debut. Jamal Murray and Jerami Grant each had 14 points. New Orleans benefited from improved shot selection. The Pelicans attempted at least 41 3-pointers in each of their first four games, but they reduced that to 33 on Thursday and made a season-high 46%. New Orleans shot 53% overall from the field. The Nuggets made just 7 of 26 3-pointers. The divide in long-range shooting was crucial, but Okafor's aggressiveness helped the Pelicans win the battle down low, too. ""I think that tonight kind of showed people that he can go against anybody, and he can handle himself,"" Holiday said of Okafor. TIP-INS Pelicans: Jackson scored 13 consecutive points during the first half. ... Lonzo Ball scored nine points and had eight assists. ... Derrick Favors (right knee soreness) missed his second straight game. ... Nicolo Melli, a 28-year-old Italian rookie, made his first career start, replacing guard J.J. Redick. Melli had seven points and four rebounds. ... Veteran guard E'Twaun Moore did not play for a fourth straight game despite being healthy. Nuggets: Porter, the 14th overall pick in 2018, missed last season after undergoing back surgery and did not appear in the first four games this season. ... Paul Millsap and Mason Plumlee each scored 10 points. ... Will Barton (left toe soreness) did not play. Torrey Craig started in his place. MAD MALONE Malone bemoaned the Nuggets' ""embarrassing effort"" multiple times after the game, noting that New Orleans outscored Denver 37-20 on fastbreak points. ""You can give all the transition defense rules that you want. To me, transition defense boils down to one thing -- effort,"" Malone said. ""Get back. You can tell them. You can lead a horse to water -- whatever analogy you want to use. We did not get back."" STARTER STRUGGLES Denver's starters scored just 48 points while the bench contributed the other 59. ""I thought guys off the bench played hard, gave effort,"" Malone said. ""We gotta find ways to get our starters to play the same way because they're not playing like that right now, they're just not.""","401160709"
"LOS ANGELES --  Gregg Popovich and Kawhi Leonard exchanged some laughs and pleasantries after Leonard's new team, the Los Angeles Clippers, defeated his former coach and the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night. If Leonard has any more nights like that against his former club, the normally irascible Popovich won't be smiling again. Leonard scored 38 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the Clippers' 103-97 victory, which handed the Spurs their first loss. It is Leonard's first points-rebounds, double-double this season. It is also his first double-double in three meetings against San Antonio, where he played seven seasons (2011-18) before being traded to Toronto in July of 2018. The 38 points ties for the fifth-most Leonard has scored in a regular-season game in his eight-year career. He took a career high 32 shots. ""It was something I look forward to,"" Leonard said about facing the Spurs. ""Just to be able to play against a great coach and my old teammates is always fun."" Leonard is 2-1 against his former team. While his departure from San Antonio wasn't amicable, Leonard said his relationship with Popovich is good, for the most part. Popovich didn't have much to say about Leonard postgame other than: ""I thought he was great."" When someone tried to get Popovich to expound, he replied: ""Doc's coaching him, I'm not. I just said he had a great game, there's nothing else to say."" Another thing going well is Leonard's start with the Clippers, the team he signed with as a free agent during the offseason. He has scored 30 or more in three of his first five games and is the first Clipper since Blake Griffin in 2015 to have at least 38 points and 12 rebounds in a game. ""Tonight was a great night for him to do his thing. We just followed his lead,"" Clippers guard Lou Williams said. Leonard -- who sat out Wednesday's game at Utah due to load management -- took control of the game in the second half, when he had 25 points on 10 of 16 shooting from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers. Los Angeles went on a 9-1 run to take a 64-55 lead with 6:55 remaining in the third quarter. Leonard scored five of his 10 third-quarter points during the rally, including a dunk after a steal of DeMar DeRozan at midcourt. San Antonio got within five (80-75) at the end of the third quarter before the Clippers scored 11 of the first 13 points in the fourth quarter with nine coming from Leonard. The Spurs scored six straight points to get within 97-93 with 2:34 left but could not get closer. The Clippers shot just 42.9% from the field, but Rivers was pleased with his team's defense. LaMarcus Aldridge came in averaging 21.3 points, but was held to five. ""It was a gritty game by both teams where no one could make a shot,"" Rivers said. ""Tonight was not a great offensive night but we were able to win it on defense."" DeRozan, a Los Angeles native, led San Antonio with 29 points and Derrick White added 20. TIP-INS Spurs: Popovich was not amused with the play of second-year guard Lonnie Walker, who was scoreless in five minutes.  Popovich said: ""I expect better effort, better awareness and a better attempt to take advantage of the minutes he gets. I thought he was non-competitive. You guys will have fun writing that."" ... G Dejounte Murray will not play Friday night against Golden State as a precaution. He had knee surgery after tearing his right ACL during the preseason last year. Clippers: This is the sixth straight year Los Angeles has started 4-2 or better. ... The Clippers are 3-0 at home for the first time in four years. ... G Lou Williams scored 12 points but was an uncharacteristic 5 of 19 from the field. ... Rivers, who is two wins shy of 900 as a coach, improved to 7-0 on Halloween and 5-0 with Los Angeles.","401160710"
"NEW YORK --  Even though James Harden's jumpers weren't falling, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson wanted to make sure his players kept defending them. So he held up a sign with a picture of former Orlando Magic player Dennis Scott, wearing his No. 3 uniform, with a red line crossing through it. The message came through loud and clear. ""It was a ridiculous sign,"" center Jarrett Allen said, ""but it made us look and it worked."" Taurean Prince had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and the Nets slowed down Harden and the Houston Rockets in a 123-116 victory Friday night. Two nights after scoring a franchise-record 159 points in a victory at Washington, the Rockets couldn't get nearly enough shots to drop after opening an early 15-point lead. They went 12 for 48 from 3-point range, with Harden a dismal 2 for 16 in the face of an improved Nets defense -- and Atkinson's unusual sign. ""It's just a defensive coverage we have and we've had trouble communicating it to the guys in the past, so we came up with this idea to find a way to communicate so everyone knows,"" Atkinson said. ""Sometimes if you use humor in things it sinks in a little more with the guys."" Harden, the NBA's leading scorer last season, fell to 14 for 70 from behind the arc this season. ""I had a lot of opportunities,"" Harden said. ""The 3-ball hasn't been going for me but I'm just going to continue to shoot. I was here yesterday, this morning was here shooting so I'm not worried about it. Those are good shots. Those are shots that I've been taking the last couple of years, so even if teams are trying to take the 3-ball away, I'm going to still shoot them."" Harden finished with 36 points and eight assists, but he was 10 for 31 from the field. Russell Westbrook added 27 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. The Nets also forced sixth man Eric Gordon to miss all five 3s in his 0-for-7 night. Westbrook was 1 for 6. ""Wide open,"" Westbrook said. ""Just got to make them."" Neither Harden nor Kyrie Irving was at his best in a matchup of the NBA's two leading scorers. Harden came in leading the league with 36.8 points per game, and scored 59 in the Washington outburst. Irving was at 35.3 per game and had scored at least 26 in all four games, but he finished with 22 points on 7-for-18 shooting with 10 assists. The Nets didn't need a big scoring performance from him in a well-balanced effort. Caris LeVert scored 25 points, Garrett Temple had 16 and Joe Harris 15. Houston led 45-30 early in the second quarter, but LeVert scored 12 points in the period to send the Nets into halftime with a 61-59 lead. Prince hit two 3-pointers during his run of eight straight points for Brooklyn that extended the lead to 85-73, and the Nets were still up 12 after three. Westbrook had three baskets early in the fourth as Houston climbed within eight, but then he checked out for a few minutes when Harden came back on, and the Rockets' push fizzled. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston had won three in a row. ... Houston has scored 30 or more in the first quarter three times in five games. Nets: Brooklyn committed 10 turnovers in the first quarter. ... Temple scored in double figures for the first time this season. He went 4 for 6 from 3-point range after going 2 for 9 in the first four games. FIRST-QUARTER FLURRY Harden lost three points in the first quarter when a review of his 3-pointer showed he stepped out of bounds first. The Nets went from a 23-18 lead going into a timeout to 23-15 coming out of it. The Rockets then ran off the next 13 points and outscored Brooklyn 18-1 the rest of the period to lead 33-24. UNSTOPPABLE SCORER? Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni was asked what Westbrook's presence prevents teams from doing against Harden that they could do before. ""To be honest with you, it wouldn't matter if he's out there, I'm out there. You could play with him,"" D'Antoni responded. ""He's getting 60 if he wants. They can try anything they want to.""","401160711"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Malcolm Brogdon is putting up some big numbers for the Indiana Pacers. The newcomer filled the box score again Friday night with 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists to push the injury-riddled Pacers to their first home win of the season, 102-95 over the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""I love it. This is a basketball city, a basketball state,"" Brogdon said. ""People show me a lot of love. I'm going to enjoy playing here."" Especially as victories come. With their defense tightening and the bench finally finding its stride Friday, the Pacers have won two straight games after starting 0-3. In avenging a 110-99 loss in Cleveland last weekend, Indiana held the Cavaliers to 37% shooting and forced 16 turnovers in an uncharacteristically low-scoring game. Jeremy Lamb totaled 21 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana, and Domantas Sabonis added 18 points and 17 rebounds, but it was the second unit that broke open a close game in the fourth quarter. Reserves accounted for 10 points in a 12-3 run that provided the Pacers an 82-71 advantage, the largest for either side all night. T.J. McConnell, who finished with five points and six assists, faked Collin Sexton into a foul in the lane and completed a three-point play. Rookie center Goga Bitazde, who finished with 10 points and nine boards and blocked four shots, drained his first 3-pointer during the sequence. ""They told me I've got to be ready any time,"" Bitazde said. ""We're all for each other. We have good chemistry. We've just got to try to keep doing this."" Indiana outscored the Cavaliers by 15 points in the 25 minutes the 6-foot-11 first-round pick roamed the floor. Bitazde seized his opportunity as Indiana played without the injured All-Star guard Victor Oladipo and starting center Myles Turner. ""Goga made huge plays,"" Lamb said. Brogdon drained four clutch free throws in the final minute to keep the Cavaliers at bay. Jordan Clarkson, who finished with 20 points and five assists, missed a 3 from the left side that would have brought Cleveland within three points in the final minute. Brogdon was acquired in a July sign-and-trade deal with Milwaukee, where he played shooting guard and averaged 15.6 points and 4.5 rebounds. With his new team, at a new position, the fourth-year professional has upped his scoring to 22.6 points per game along with 10.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds. Sexton had 21 points for the Cavs, who led 26-19 after the first quarter but fell into a 42-37 hole at halftime. Indiana, which shot 41% for the game and missed 22 of 27 3-point tries, was ahead 68-61 entering the final period. ""I thought our bench did a good job in that first half as well as the second lifting us and getting us going."" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""You might have nights like that where your shot's not falling, and you're going to need your bench to help you."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Love had 22 points and 17 boards. ... The team announced that general manager Koby Altman signed a ""long-term"" contract extension. Coach John Beilein reacted by expressing his hope for ""a really strong partnership, that we've got each other's backs all the time."" Pacers: TJ Leaf started at power forward with Sabonis moving to center in place of Turner, who suffered a sprained right ankle Wednesday in a 118-108 win at Brooklyn. Leaf played eight minutes and did not score. ... Indiana outscored Cleveland in the paint 56-38. REMINISCING During shootaround, Beilein's mind wandered back to his days in college basketball when he coached Michigan in Big Ten tournament games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. ""It seemed like whenever we came into this building we were on the bubble,"" he said. ""We had to go in here and win one, two or three games to get in the NCAA tournament, so I've got fond memories. I love this town. Just the way it's laid out for fans and basketball, I love coming to Indy.""","401160712"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It was a pretty typical performance for Giannis Antetokounmpo. Donte DiVincenzo was a bit of a surprise. Antetokounmpo had 29 points and 14 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks pounded the Orlando Magic 123-91 on Friday night. While the reigning NBA MVP was great once again, DiVincenzo scored 14 points in his most extensive action so far this season. He played two minutes in the Bucks' first four games and had not taken a shot. DiVincenzo went 4 for 7 from 3-point range. He also contributed three assists and two steals in 17 minutes. ""He hasn't played all season, and one thing I told him was to stay ready,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""You're going to get your opportunity, and he was ready tonight."" Eric Bledsoe added 18 points, six rebounds and six assists for Milwaukee, which was coming off a 116-105 loss at Boston on Wednesday night. Khris Middleton added 16 points and six rebounds. The Bucks grabbed control by making nine 3-pointers during a key stretch in the first half. They went 17 for 47 from beyond the arc on the night. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 19 points. Nikola Vucevic had 14 points and seven rebounds. Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, Bledsoe, Ersan Ilyasova (two), Sterling Brown, George Hill and DiVincenzo (two) connected from long range during a 32-7 run for the Bucks. ""You could feel things shifting in that first quarter,"" DiVincenzo said. ""Everybody on our team is so unselfish. We have guys who could get 25 every night, but instead we have a balanced attack and guys getting open looks."" After making eight of their first nine shots on their way to a 20-7 lead, the Magic were outscored 40-9 over the next 11 minutes, most of it by Milwaukee's reserves. ""Orlando was doing a lot of things well early, but our bench came in and flipped the script,"" said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""We had really good bench play tonight."" The Bucks led 79-51 after Middleton scored seven straight points midway through the third quarter. Milwaukee shot 50.5 percent for the game. The Bucks also had a 57-41 rebound advantage and scored 54 points in the paint. ""They were wide open, wide open ... wide open. It wasn't like they made all these great shots, it was wide open,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""It was an unacceptable effort against a great team and they played well."" TIP-INS Bucks: Seventeen of the Bucks' first 21 shots were 3-pointers. ... G Pat Connaughton left the floor with a shoulder injury in the third quarter, but returned to the game. ... Kyle Korver rested. Budenholzer said the Bucks would look for periodic games off for the 38-year-old guard. Magic: F Amile Jefferson, who had been on a two-way contract with Orlando, signed a standard contract Friday. ... C Mo Bamba (load management) and G Michael Carter-Williams (bruised hip) were out. NO MAGIC TOUCH The Magic came into the game last in the NBA in scoring (95.8 points per game) and shooting (.395) and second-last in 3-point shooting (.288). They didn't do anything to help themselves, shooting 37.4 percent and scoring under 100 points for the fifth straight time.","401160713"
"BOSTON --  Jayson Tatum made a big play at a big moment for the Boston Celtics. Then he made it sound very routine. Tatum hit a turnaround jumper with 1.3 seconds remaining, and the Celtics beat the New York Knicks 104-102 on Friday night for their fourth straight victory. ""It feels great, but I don't want to get too excited,"" Tatum said. ""The guys that I look up to in this league, they've do things like this all the time."" Tatum finished with 24 points. Kemba Walker scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half, and Gordon Hayward had 13 points and nine boards. Walker called Tatum's basket ""a huge, big-time shot."" ""I'm happy we went to him,"" he said. ""Hopefully that keeps him confident. That can really just get something going for us. That was an unbelievable play."" Unlike a 118-95 rout at Madison Square Garden the previous Saturday, Boston was pushed by New York until the very end of a game that featured 24 lead changes and 10 ties. Marcus Morris, who played the last two seasons with the Celtics before signing with New York as a free agent, led the Knicks with 29 points. Morris made four foul shots in the final minute, and then hit a tying 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left. ""We stayed locked in all game long,"" said Knicks rookie RJ Barrett, who finished with 15 points and seven rebounds. ""The whole fourth quarter we was fighting, and that's the identity of our team. We did that tonight."" After Morris' late 3, the Celtics called timeout and Marcus Smart inbounded the ball to Tatum in the corner. He caught the pass, turned around and pulled up for a shot from the corner that was initially called a 3-pointer. It was quickly overturned during the timeout, but it didn't matter. The Celtics broke up a long inbound pass and the Knicks didn't get off another shot. Morris congratulated his former teammate after the game. ""It was good to see him get his first one (game-winning shot),"" Morris said. ""I wish it could have been against somebody else, but hey -- it's the NBA."" WELCOME WALKER It was the third straight game with 30-plus points by Walker, who scored 32 in the previous two and finished with his best game since signing with the Celtics as a free agent. Walker also hit all 14 of his foul shots and added five assists and six rebounds. ""We stuck with the game,"" Walker said. ""It came down to a last-second shot, but (we'll) take wins any way you can get them."" LONG BALL The Knicks led 50-49 at halftime and opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Frank Ntilikina, starting a period full of shots from beyond the arc. Both clubs hit five 3-pointers in the quarter before the Celtics carried a 75-74 lead into the fourth. The back-and-forth continued in the final period. Boston regained the lead on a three-point play by Walker, putting the Celtics up 87-86 with 5:19 remaining. Hayward followed with a 3-pointer and Tatum hit a pair of foul shots to stretch the lead to 92-86 with 4:14 left to play. The Knicks pulled within a point at 92-91, then again at 95-94 on a 3-pointer by Morris, but the Celtics answered with a pair of free throws by Walker and a 3-pointer by Tatum with 1:50 remaining, giving Boston a 99-94 lead. TIP-INS Knicks: Bobby Portis had 13 points and seven rebounds. ... Ntilikina scored 10. He started at point guard, where the Knicks were without Elfrid Payton (hamstring), Dennis Smith Jr. (death in the family) and Kadeem Allen (knee). Celtics: Rookie Grant Williams scored 10 points.","401160714"
"CHICAGO --  Trailing by one in the closing minutes, the Chicago Bulls were looking for someone to hit the big shots. Zach LaVine delivered the baskets they needed. LaVine scored 26 points, Otto Porter Jr. added 22, and the Bulls overcame a big effort by Derrick Rose against his former team to beat the Detroit Pistons 112-106 on Friday night. Rose delighted the hometown crowd with 23 points and seven assists. But the Bulls came away with the win after dropping three in a row while handing the Pistons their fourth loss in five games. LaVine put Chicago ahead for good with back-to-back 3-pointers and added four free throws in the final 11.5 seconds. ""Somebody's got to step up to the plate,"" he said. ""I think I'm that dude."" Porter did his part, shooting 8 of 12 and nailing three 3's. Wendell Carter Jr. added 16 points and 11 rebounds, and the Bulls snapped a seven-game losing streak against the Pistons. ROSE'S RETURN Rose got a loud ovation when he entered the game in the first quarter and heard those familiar ""MVP! MVP!"" chants from the Chicago crowd throughout the night. The South Side product flashed some of the old explosiveness that made him the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2008 and NBA's youngest MVP three years later, before injuries derailed his promising career with the Bulls. ""I felt the love out there,"" Rose said. ""I wish we would have gotten the win, but coming here is always special and playing here is always special."" Andre Drummond led Detroit with 25 points and 24 rebounds -- his third 20-20 game this season. Luke Kennard scored 15 and made three 3-pointers. But the Pistons missed their first 14 from beyond the arc before he hit one late in the first half and were 6 of 29 in the game. PULLING AWAY Chicago, which led by as much as 16, trailed 100-99 after a layup by Tony Snell. But LaVine responded by hitting back-to-back 3's to put the Bulls back on top 105-100 with three minutes left. Chicago was clinging to a 107-104 lead with just over a minute remaining when Tomas Satoransky got called for traveling. But Rose missed a runner. After LaVine missed a layup, Snell missed a 3 for Detroit. Carter then made 1 of 2 free throws with 17.5 seconds remaining to make it 108-104. Kennard then missed a 3, and LaVine hit two free throws, bumping the lead to six with 11.5 seconds left. QUOTABLE ""He is as tough a cover in the league as there is right now, with his ability to split, his ability to burst, his ability to sneak and his ability to shoot the ball. I'm really happy for him."" -- Bulls coach Jim Boylen on Rose. TIP-INS Pistons: Despite the poor 3-point shooting, Detroit shot just over 48 percent overall. ... The Pistons still don't have a timetable for the return of star F Blake Griffin (left hamstring and posterior knee soreness), who has missed the first six games. ""Obviously, we're all hoping that it's sooner than later,"" said assistant Sidney Lowe, who handled pregame media duties with coach Dwane Casey a game-time decision because of an illness. ""He was out there on his own today doing some stuff."" ... Casey worked the game. Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen hurt his left side and missed the final 9:30 after being held out down the stretch two nights earlier at Cleveland. Markkanen could have returned to the game and does not expect the injury to linger. ... Boylen expects F Chandler Hutchison (strained left hamstring) to practice Saturday and travel with the team to Indiana for Sunday's game. He wasn't sure if the second-year pro will be ready to make his season debut against the Pacers.  ... Rose wasn't the only former Bulls player to get a big ovation. The crowd greeted former teammate Joakim Noah with a big one when he was shown on the videoboard in the second quarter.","401160715"
"DALLAS --  LeBron James faced the crowd and sidestepped his way up the floor after a punctuating 3-pointer in overtime made possible by Danny Green's buzzer-beating 3 in regulation. The Lakers star took an extra peek toward the national TV crew at center court, perhaps to gauge the entertainment value of the first matchup of the 15-time All-Star alongside Anthony Davis against Dallas' young European pair of Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis. The extra period was anticlimactic -- but didn't really take away from the second half that preceded it. Davis started overtime with back-to-back dunks after Green's corner 3, and the Lakers beat the Mavericks 119-110 on Friday night amid matching triple-doubles from James and Doncic, the Slovenian who grew up admiring the four-time MVP. ""You never know who you can inspire along your path,"" James said. ""For me, playing the game the right way, getting my teammates involved and playing for the purity of the game, I was able to inspire a kid that wasn't even in America. That's pretty special."" James had a season-high 39 points with 16 assists and 10 rebounds, while Doncic finished with 31 points, a career-high 15 assists and 13 boards. According to the NBA, they became the youngest and oldest players in NBA history with triple-doubles that included at least 30 points and 15 assists, doing so in the same game. The 20-year-old Doncic, who grew up modeling his game after James, had his 10th career triple-double, extending his record for the most for a player under 21. James, who has 82 for his career, is third on that list with five. James had nine points in overtime, starting with a three-point play that followed Davis' dunks for a second 10-0 run going back to regulation -- following one that immediately wiped out a 10-point halftime lead to start the third quarter. The last of Doncic's assists went to Dorian Finney-Smith for a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute of regulation. The Mavericks got a stop, but Dwight Powell missed one of two free throws to keep their lead at three, setting up Green's tying corner 3 on James' 14th assist. The Mavericks had a foul to give when James dribbled inside the 3-point line before finding Green. ""That's on me,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Our plan in that situation was to foul a guy on the catch in a non-shooting situation. But the fact that we were unable to do it is on me."" Davis had 31 points and eight rebounds. Kristaps Porzingis finished with 16 points and nine boards after a fast start for the 7-foot-3 Latvian that included a crossover dribble 3-pointer in front of Davis in the best test yet of opposing big-name duos for him and Doncic. Doncic had his triple-double before the end of the third quarter, helping the Mavericks restore all but one point of a 10-point halftime lead after the Lakers put together a 10-0 run coming out of halftime. ""You can't watch this game and say the NBA isn't one of the most enjoyable things to watch in the world,"" Carlisle said. ""We're not happy about losing. That's all."" The Mavericks expanded a nine-point lead to 11 in the first half despite being without Doncic and Porzingis for nearly a full quarter because of foul trouble. Part of the reason was the season debut of 7-foot-4 (formerly 7-3) Boban Marjanovic, who had four points and seven rebounds along with three fouls in 11 minutes. TIP-INS Lakers: James was 4 of 7 on 3s in the second half after missing his two attempts before halftime. ... Green finished with 14 points. Avery Bradley scored 11. ... At 4-1, the Lakers are off to their best start since going 8-0 to open the 2010-11 season. Mavericks: Had a repeat of the starting lineup for the first time this season, using the one from a 109-106 win in Denver. It was Doncic, Porzingis, Powell, Seth Curry and Finney-Smith. Doncic and Porzingis are the only players to start all five games. ... Powell scored 14 points, Delon Wright had 12 and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 11. ... Dallas had five players in double figures after tying a franchise record with nine against the Nuggets. DONCIC'S BUMP Doncic took a hard fall in the final minute of regulation when he collided with Finney-Smith while they chased a loose ball on a rebound. He was checking the back of his head for blood as play continued and was getting stitches after the game. KUZMA DEBUT Kyle Kuzma made his season debut for the Lakers with nine points and three rebounds in 19 minutes, about how much coach Frank Vogel said he would play after missing the preseason with a right ankle injury from his stint with USA Basketball during the summer.","401160716"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  De'Aaron Fox got back to attacking the rim. Buddy Hield and Bogdan Bogdanovic found their rhythm from the perimeter. And Luke Walton finally got his first victory with Sacramento. With one all-inclusive performance, the Kings ended their worst start in nearly 30 years and shook off the label of being the NBA's only remaining winless team. Harrison Barnes scored on an offensive rebound with 2.9 seconds remaining after Nemanja Bjelica's missed 3-pointer, and the Kings won their first game of the season, beating the Utah Jazz 102-101 on Friday night. ""It was probably the first time all season we put together a full game,"" Barnes said. ""Everyone down the line came in and contributed, and that was the team effort that we needed, the energy, the fight when they made runs, that we needed."" It wasn't all pretty. Sacramento committed 17 turnovers, made only 12 of 17 free throws and was outscored 13-5 over the final 5 minutes. But for a franchise that had playoff aspirations after going 39-43 a year ago, it was a definitive step forward. ""We were hungry tonight? Yes. Have we been hungry most games to start? Yes, and then it fades out,"" Walton said. ""But that's the intensity that we have to have for an entire game. Hopefully we feel that, we build on it and we continue to go in the right direction."" Fox scored 25 points, Hield had 18 and Bogdanovic added 14 to help the Kings (1-5). Donovan Mitchell had 24 points for the Jazz (4-2). Rudy Gobert added 15 points and 16 rebounds, and Mike Conley scored 19. Mitchell's desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer grazed the front of the rim. ""We knew it wasn't the last minute that lost us the game. It was things we did in between the quarters,"" Conley said. ""Defensively we weren't ourselves in different areas. They attacked us in pick and rolls, they were aggressive, and you can tell they were trying to get a win. They did everything necessary to do that. We didn't come with the same energy."" Nearly a week after getting blown out by the Jazz 113-81 in Salt Lake City, the Kings built an early lead, nearly gave it all away, then made a pair of big plays down the stretch to win. Utah trailed 97-88 before scoring nine straight to tie the game on Mitchell's 22-foot jumper. After Dewayne Dedmon made a 3-pointer for Sacramento, Mitchell fed Gobert for an alley-oop dunk, then scored on a layup to put the Jazz up 101-100 with 11.2 seconds left. Bjelica, who made three 3s earlier in the game, missed from the left corner with the clock running down, but Harrison grabbed the rebound and scored the winner. ""Belly had a good look, a look that we all have a lot of confidence in (him) to knock that shot down,"" Barnes said. ""(I) found a good bounce and was able to put it in."" It's the first time in six games that Utah has allowed more than 100 points. SEVEN AND OH NO Sacramento had trouble taking care of the ball and committed seven turnovers in the first quarter. The upside? Utah failed to score a single point off the mistakes. HOLDING NOTHING BACK Walton used his final timeout with 6:36 left to play, a risky decision but one the Kings first-year coach was comfortable with. ""It's a philosophy of mine when other teams are going on a run, let's see if the players can figure it out first,"" Walton said. ""Tonight I wasn't going to let that happen. We've been slipping too much when other teams go on runs."" TIP-INS Jazz: Ed Davis scored eight points in 21 minutes before leaving the game with a left lower leg contusion. . Jeff Green made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to end the third quarter. . Coach Quin Snyder was called for a technical when he angrily stormed onto the court after Jeff Green was called for an offensive foul in the third quarter. Kings: Fox made a nice move to shake Conley and left the Utah guard standing at the 3-point line, but missed an open dunk and the ball ricocheted to the other end of the court.","401160717"
"Draymond Green says he hurt his left index finger in Friday night's loss to the Spurs, impacting his ability to grip the ball. (0:29) SAN FRANCISCO --  Draymond Green and the Golden State Warriors are finding out what it's like to be a team saddled with injuries. Patty Mills came off the bench to score 31 points and the San Antonio Spurs beat Golden State 127-110 on Friday night, hours after the Warriors learned they will be without injured star Stephen Curry for at least three months. A sellout crowd of 18,064 was announced at Chase Center, yet there were a noticeable number of empty seats in the Warriors' new arena. Curry's injury has compounded things for a franchise that appears destined for a long season after appearing in the NBA Finals for five consecutive seasons. ""We went the bulk of five years being pretty healthy. We went the bulk of five years beating up on pretty much everyone,"" Green said. ""Right now, it's our turn to get beat up on. It's kind of what's going on."" LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points for the Spurs (4-1), who were coming off their first loss of the season a night earlier. D'Angelo Russell led Golden State (1-4) with 30 points. The game was an indication of the uphill battle facing Golden State without Curry, who underwent surgery after breaking his left hand Wednesday against Phoenix. The Warriors, also without injured guard Klay Thompson for at least the first half of the season, hope they won't be missing another star. Green had his left index finger wrapped after the game and said he's unsure if he'll be able to play Saturday against Charlotte. Russell couldn't carry the Warriors alone, even with three teammates in double figures. Rookie Jordan Poole scored 20. Warriors fans began filing out of the arena midway through the fourth quarter. Golden State is winless in three home games this season. Russell scored 19 points in the first half and the Warriors were within two points at the break, 57-55. The Spurs took control in the third period, scoring 40 points and taking a 97-86 lead. That included 12 points from Aldridge in the quarter and a 13-2 Spurs run. Mills, who starred in college for Saint Mary's in nearby Moraga, California, hit six of his nine 3-point attempts and finished three points shy of his career high of 34 points. That career-best game came against the Warriors on April 26, 2012. ""I mean, just (being in) attack mode mindset, being aggressive. I think that was more the key than anything,"" Mills said. ""You've got to be in that mindset."" TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge (eight rebounds) broke the 8,000-rebound mark and became the first NBA player to hit the 8,000-rebound and 18,000-point milestones since he was drafted in 2006. He's scored 18,689 career points. . Forward DeMarre Carroll, a 10-year veteran who signed a two-year deal with San Antonio in the offseason, entered in the first quarter for his season debut. He finished with two points. Warriors: Coach Steve Kerr stressed before the game that he would look to manage Draymond Green's minutes to keep him fresh. Kerr also acknowledged the importance of the veteran's leadership in light of numerous injuries. ""Right now he's kind of the lone survivor."" TEAM USA The U.S. national women's basketball team attended Friday's game and received a standing ovation. Team USA is playing an exhibition at Stanford on Saturday. ODD NIGHT What a crazy stat line for Spurs center Trey Lyles. He finished with zero points and 14 rebounds. LEE SHINES Warriors guard Damion Lee came off the bench to score 16 points. He scored a season-high 23 on Monday at New Orleans.","401160718"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Oklahoma City Thunder coach Billy Donovan has experimented with a three-guard lineup early in a rebuilding season. He had to go beyond that Saturday, due to injury, illness and foul trouble. With starting center Steven Adams sidelined by a knee injury for the second straight game and backup Nerlens Noel getting into foul trouble, Donovan went with a lineup that sometimes featured 6-foot-10 forward Danilo Gallinari and no one else over 6-6 on the floor. It was effective enough to hold New Orleans at bay and propel the Thunder to just their second win of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 23 points and eight rebounds, and the Thunder beat the Pelicans 115-104. Dennis Schroder and rookie Darius Bazley each added 17 points for the Thunder. Gallinari scored 16 points and Chris Paul finished with 15 points and nine assists. ""I thought it was a good team win because everybody contributed,"" Donovan said. ""I thought at the end of the third (quarter) and throughout the beginning part of the fourth, we got really good play from our bench."" Bazley saw his most extensive action, playing just under 19 minutes. Hamidou Diallo stepped up to play more than 29 minutes when starter Terrance Ferguson came down with flu-like symptoms in the first quarter, and he contributed 12 points, five rebounds and rim protection.  Noel managed to navigate around his foul trouble to block six shots. JJ Redick scored 17 points for the Pelicans, who were coming off their only victory of the season. The Pelicans played most of the game without leading scorer Brandon Ingram, who left midway through the second quarter with an injury. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 10 points in the first seven minutes and had 18 at halftime. Bazley scored eight points in the third quarter. The Thunder took a 94-86 lead into the fourth quarter. New Orleans cut it to 104-101 with 5:10 remaining on Redick's 3-pointer, but Paul and Gallinari responded with back-to-back 3 and Schroder took control of the game in the final minutes on defense as Oklahoma City pulled away. ""I thought Chris and Gallo were really efficient tonight with the way they played,"" Donovan said. ""I think everybody contributed today and that was good to see. Offensively, we continue to improve and get better."" Jahlil Okafor took advantage of Oklahoma City's lack of size, scoring 15 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, but he was ineffective down the stretch as New Orleans fell to 1-5. ""We keep turning the ball over; 17 turnovers for 23 points. You just can't survive that, especially on the road,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We've got to do a much better job protecting the ball. We've got to do a better job of getting back and getting our defense set. And then we've got to do a better job of executing down the stretch. We didn't do those things."" Ingram, who was averaging 26.8 points, appeared to try and intentionally foul Gilgeous-Alexander on a drive to stop play, but didn't get a whistle.  A few seconds later, on a dead ball, he came out of the game and went straight to the Pelicans locker room with an apparent head injury. He did not return to the bench for the remainder of the game, finishing with just seven points. New Orleans is already missing rookie No. 1 pick Zion Williamson, who is recovering from knee surgery. TIP-INS Pelicans: Lonzo Ball injured his ankle in the third quarter but was able to return to the game. He finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. ... This was the first professional meeting between Pelicans guard Nick Alexander-Walker and Gilgeous-Alexander, cousins who played in prep school together. Alexander-Walker checked in at the 3:17 mark of the first quarter to guard Gilgeous-Alexander. He didn't allow Gilgeous-Alexander to score in their first encounter but did pick up a foul trying to cover him. ""It was a surreal moment,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""It was something we dreamed about obviously our whole lives and for us to be able to actually live it out is crazy."" Thunder: Adams is listed as day to day.

"DETROIT -- Though Bruce Brown had career highs in points and assists on Saturday night, his coach was just as interested with a stat he didn't pile up. No turnovers. Coach Dwane Casey praised his second-year player after a 113-109 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, in which Brown had 22 points and seven assists in his first career start as a point guard. ""That was the key to the game was not letting them get out in transition,"" Casey said of the turnovers. ""He did an excellent job. Him being a point guard, that's why the summer league was beneficial for him, to make sure that he learned to run pick-and-roll, to run the team. He did a good job."" Andre Drummond had 25 points and 20 rebounds, and Luke Kennard finished with 24 points and helped seal the win with a driving basket and two free throws in the final 30 seconds of both teams' second game in two nights. Drummond had at least 20 points and 20 rebounds for the third straight game and fourth time in seven games this season. He added six assists, five blocks and three steals. ""He's a big guy, and he's skilled under there in terms of rebounding,"" Nets center Jarrett Allen said. ""He knows where to put his body and he knows where to put himself. At the end of the day, he has every skill set needed for it."" Kyrie Irving had his first triple-double with Brooklyn with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. He played well late but scored six points in the first three quarters, in part because of Brown's defense. The game swung wildly in the middle quarters. The Nets outscored Detroit by 15 points in the second quarter, and the Pistons turned it around for a 14-point advantage in the third. ""We were down 14 in the third quarter, but it was nothing but grit and grind to come back the way the guys did,"" Casey said. ""We've got to be that way every night."" The Pistons, who averaged 19.8 turnovers in the first six games, committed eight in the first half but none after halftime. Spencer Dinwiddie split a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds remaining, and Drummond did the same with 6.7 seconds left to put the Pistons up 111-108. Prince then split a pair, missing the second on purpose, and Drummond grabbed the rebound and made a pair with 3.6 seconds left to seal the win. ""For some reason we ran out of gas in the second half, and I'm not sure why,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Drummond had 11 rebounds in the first quarter and assisted the first three baskets. His playmaking was a boost for a team short on ball handlers. Playing without injured point guards Reggie Jackson (back), Derrick Rose (hamstring) and Tim Frazier (shoulder), the Pistons played Brown and Kennard at the position, with Drummond facilitating from the high post. ""It was a game of opportunity for some guys,"" Kennard said. ""Bruce, the way he stepped up tonight, he was kind of one of our leaders on the court. So credit to the kid. He played his heart out offensively and he was guarding their best player throughout the entire game."" Taurean Prince added 20 points and Joe Harris had 18 for the Nets. TIP-INS Brooklyn: Caris LeVert said Friday night's 25-point performance against Houston was in honor of his grandmother, who died this week. LeVert had 14 points on Saturday. ... DeAndre Jordan returned to the starting lineup for the third game this season. Atkinson said before the game that Allen has struggled against Drummond, and that could force a change. In three games against Brooklyn last season, Drummond averaged 9.3 offensive rebounds per game. Detroit: This was Detroit's third different starting lineup in seven games this season. ... The Rev. Jesse Jackson was in attendance. MONTH OFF Jackson is out at least four weeks with a back injury, the team announced earlier Saturday. Jackson, who played the season's first two games but has missed the past four, has a stress reaction in his lower back. The team announced treatment and rehabilitation has started and he will be re-evaluated in four weeks. All-Star Blake Griffin has missed all seven games with lingering soreness in his left knee and hamstring. It was announced before the season that Griffin would be re-evaluated in early November. MAKING HISTORY Drummond became the third player in the past 25 years to have three straight 20-point, 20-rebound games, joining Kevin Love and DeMarcus Cousins. There has been only one other 20-20 game this season, by Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers. TRIP-DUB Irving now has three career triple-doubles. He now has had one with each of his three career teams -- Cleveland, Boston and Brooklyn.","401160720"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets pushed aside the Orlando Magic to snap a two-game losing streak. Murray scored 22 points, Jokic had 20 points and seven rebounds and both made big late plays to help Denver beat Orlando 91-87 on Saturday night. ""It's the little stuff that's going to help us be successful on offense,"" Murray said. ""We all know we can shoot, we're struggling with shots right now, but all that will change sometime."" Jokic hit a shot from the corner with 1:53 left to put Denver up 84-81. Murray made a jumper with 1:24 left, drove for a dunk and an 88-83 lead with 35 seconds remaining, and wrapped up the victory with two free throws with 5.1 seconds left. ""If you're a good team, you don't go on extended losing streaks. That's the reality of the NBA,"" said Denver coach Michael Malone. ""If you're going to be a good team, you respond. ... So we got back to defending and play with great energy and sharing the ball."" Sixteen of Jokic's 20 points came in the second half. ""I was just more aggressive,"" he said. ""I just wanted to make them react to me, and that takes a lot of pressure off other players."" The Nuggets shot only 37%, but pulled ahead in the third quarter when the Magic made only seven of 25 shots. Nikola Vuevic scored 24 points for Orlando, and Aaron Gordon added 21 points and nine rebounds. Vucevic made his first five shots and helped Orlando to a 12-point lead, the largest of the game for either team. Two free throws by Torrey Craig with 4:01 left in the third quarter gave the Nuggets their first lead, 61-60. A 3-pointer by Malik Beasley stretched Denver's lead to eight early in the fourth quarter. Vucevic's 3-pointer tied it at 81 with 3:57 left, but Murray and Jokic scored nine of Denver's 10 points after that. TIP-INS Nuggets: F Will Barton missed a second game with an inflamed left toe. ... Coach Michael Malone burned two timeouts within 41 seconds during a first-quarter Magic run. ... F Michael Porter Jr., who played 21 minutes in his NBA debut Thursday night, had three points and four rebounds in seven minutes. ... Denver failed to score 100 points for the first time this season.

G Michael Carter-Williams missed a second straight game with a left hip contusion. FULTZ GETS FIRST MAGIC START Markelle Fultz started for the first time for Orlando, replacing D.J. Augustin at point guard. The first overall pick by Philadelphia in the 2017 NBA Draft, Fultz was traded to the Magic in February but did not play last season for the Magic. Augustin had started 115 straight games for the Magic going back to Feb. 8, 2018. MORE SHOTS FOR JOKIC Jokic took 14 shots, matching his total in the two preceding games. ""For us to be at our best we need him to take at least 15 shots a night,"" Malone said. ""That's a challenge for him the way teams guard him. Nobody's ever going to accuse Nikola Jokic of being a selfish player, but I need him to come out and set the tone early, be more aggressive and look to score. Now that's going to open things up for everybody else.""","401160721"
"WASHINGTON --  The Minnesota Timberwolves had no problem in their first game without star center Karl-Anthony Towns. Andrew Wiggins scored 21 points, Robert Covington and Jarrett Culver each added 20 and the Timberwolves cruised to a 131-109 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Towns was serving the first of a two-game suspension for fighting with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid on Wednesday. In his first four games, Towns was among the league leaders in scoring and rebounds. ""We knew we were missing Kat,"" Wiggins said. ""Kat's not somebody you can replace, so everyone had to step up, and that's what everyone did. ""You've just got to remember, we play a certain way. You don't want to get out of character."" Minnesota, which improved to 4-1 for the first time since 2012-13, had six players in double figures. Bradley Beal scored 30 points for Washington (1-4). The Wizards began the 2018-19 season with seven losses in eight games. ""We were in a fog,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""There's no excuses. It's on me."" Minnesota led throughout the game. The Wolves were already ahead by 10 with 3  1/2 minutes gone in the second quarter and increased their lead steadily. Wiggins' 3-pointer at the buzzer to end the third quarter extended the lead to 106-72. Gorgui Dieng, who started in place of Towns, scored 18 points. Jeff Teague had 15 points and 13 assists, and Jake Layman added 14 points. Dieng had played just six minutes all season, not getting to play in three of the first four games. ""Even though he wasn't playing this year, he stayed ready, he stayed in place,"" Wiggins said. ""And whenever he got his chance, he maximized it."" After losing 159-158 to Houston on Wednesday, the Wizards completely fell apart against the Timberwolves. Minnesota won the last meeting between the teams on March 9, and this game broke a pattern of alternating wins and losses over 20 meetings that began March 9, 2009. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Coach Ryan Saunders, who was an assistant coach in Washington under his late father, Flip, keeps a residence in Washington. ""This is almost like a second home to me,"" Saunders said. ""It was fun to be here with the Nationals, and that excitement. I can't claim the Nationals. I've always been a Twins fan. They're my second favorite team."" Wizards: F Rui Hachimura, who had 23 points in just his fourth professional game, was held to four. He missed nine of his 11 field goals. HARD DECISIONS FOR SAUNDERS Dieng has played each of his seven seasons with Minnesota, and Saunders wants him to earn his playing time. ""I want hard decisions when it comes to playing guys,"" Saunders said. ""That means guys are playing well and guys are buying in. But as we can see tonight, there's roles that we have on this team. And we want to make sure we put the best groups out there together. And then we also can keep guys in roles, too."" POINT GUARD WITHOUT TOWNS Teague acknowledged that it was a major adjustment to play without Towns. ""Karl is one of those talents where you've got to make a point to get him the ball,"" Teague said. ""He has the ability to do so many things. When he's out, it's a little different."" HACHIMURA'S SLUMP Hachimura entered the game averaging 18 points in his first four  Brooks knew he was due for a slump. ""You have one bad game,"" Brooks said. ""Let's not make it two. If it's two, let's not make it three."" By necessity, Beal must serve as a mentor to Hachimura. ""He'll learn that as he continues to play, the game will slow down for him,"" Beal said. ""Right now it's probably 100 mph.""","401160722"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Aron Baynes isn't worried about style points from 3-point range. The Australian center converted a career-best four 3-pointers Saturday night, leading to 20 points and the Phoenix Suns used a third quarter burst to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-105. Baynes' last 3-pointer came from a familiar spot around the top of the key and caromed in from straight away. He didn't really say whether he called bank. ""I could have made a better play, but at the end of the day, happy it went down,"" the 6-foot-10 center said, adding: ""Better to learn in victory than it is in defeat, though. We'll take it."" Devin Booker had 21 points to help the Suns improve to 4-2. He and Baynes combined to go 14 of 23 from the field and 7 of 10 from 3-point range, with Booker converting all three of his 3-point attempts. The Suns finished the night shooting 50%, including 14 of 34 from distance. Rookie Ja Morant led Memphis with 24 points and seven assists. Dillon Brooks and Brandon Clarke scored 16 points each, Clarke adding 11 rebounds. As it has through much of the early season, the game would get away from Memphis in the third quarter, part of the ongoing second-half problems for the young Grizzlies. Memphis has held halftime leads in all but one game this season, but have stumbled in the final two frames. This time, Phoenix outscored Memphis 37-22 in the third, with the Grizzlies committing 11 turnovers. That helped the Suns to convert a two-point halftime deficit into a lead that reached 14 as Phoenix carried an 82-69 lead into the fourth quarter. ""We came in (before) the third quarter and talked about the adversity we've faced this season, and how we need to stick together through it all,"" Booker said about the second-half change. ""Went out there, kept moving the ball. Started out very good in the third quarter and it just continued the rest of the game."" The second-half struggles are part of the growing pains for Memphis as it tries to make its way through a rebuilding phase around Morant and second-year forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who left the game in the third quarter with a right knee injury. ""Up (at) halftime, we've faced this before where teams pick up their energy,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""I didn't feel our energy was there in the third quarter."" TIP-INS Suns: Kelly Oubre Jr. added 15 points and Frank Kaminsky had 14, 11 in the first half. .Were 11 of 14 inside the arc in the first quarter; 2 of 7 from 3-point range. ...

They ranked in the bottom five in pace every season since 2012-13. ""When we started hitting the first day of camp, our guys really started to buy in,"" Jenkins said. ""Every single day we talk about our pace. Every day in film, we talk about our pace.""

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo carried a big chip on his broad shoulders against the Toronto Raptors. Antetokounmpo had 36 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and four blocks to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 115-105 victory over the Raptors on Saturday night in the first meeting between the teams since the Eastern Conference finals. ""Definitely, I had a lot of motivation,"" he said. ""Obviously, a different team. Kawhi (Leonard) is not on the team, but I think guys have stepped up. (Kyle) Lowry is still playing amazing. (Pascal) Siakam has stepped up a lot for this team. They are the team that cost us a trip to the NBA Finals. Obviously, you are going to come out and play a little bit harder and have a little bit extra juice in you."" Eric Bledsoe added 14 points and five assists, and Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each had 11 points for the Bucks. The Bucks had the best record in the East last season and then took a 2-0 lead over the Raptors in the conference finals, but Toronto took the next four en route to its first NBA championship. In this rematch, Lowry scored a season-high 36 points on 11-of-18 shooting, including 5 of 9 from 3-point range. Pascal Siakam added 16 for Toronto, which had won four of its first five this season. Marc Gasol grabbed 12 rebounds and had 10 points. The Bucks' habit of blowing big leads nearly cost them again. They led by 19 in the first half against Boston and 21 in the third quarter over Miami, but lost them both. ""We've got to get better,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's happened three times so far. We've got to get better and be in the moment. We cannot relax. People are coming after us. Nothing is going to be given to us."" The Raptors, who had trailed by as much as 26 points, pulled within four three times in the fourth quarter, the last on a 3-pointer from Fred VanVleet that made it 107-103 with 2:24 to play. Toronto coach Nick Nurse challenged the call on Siakam's sixth foul with 1:41 to play, but a review confirmed it and George Hill pushed the lead to six with two free throws. Antetokounmpo tacked on two more baskets and Bledsoe added one for the final margin. VanVleet, who finished with 12 points and seven assists, looked at this game as an early season matchup, a learning experience and nothing more. ""We didn't go into this with a playoff game-plan scheme,"" he said. ""We had a good game plan. We didn't execute it very well. There's going to be games like that."" Lowry's 17 points and 12 from Siakam pulled Toronto to 95-90 heading into the fourth quarter. The Bucks led 36-17 at the end of the first quarter and 66-50 at the half behind 17 points from Antetokounmpo and a dismal offensive showing from Toronto. The Raptors shot 13 of 41 from the floor. Siakam, Toronto's leading scorer averaging 28 points, had five points on 2-for-8 shooting. ""We played terrible. We couldn't make a shot. We couldn't do anything,"" Siakam said of the Raptors' first half. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had one game out of 65 last season with 30-plus points. ... Toronto shot 3 for 18 (16.7 percent) from the floor at the end of the first quarter. ... G Patrick McCaw missed the game with left knee pain.

QUOTABLE Reflecting on Lowry scoring 17 of his 36 points in the third quarter, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said, ""Hopefully, by the fourth, he was just fatigued. Or, the basketball gods said he can't play that good another quarter."" Lowry scored only two points in the fourth, a driving layup for the Raptors' final margin. STATS LINE Antetokounmpo had at least 35 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks in a game for the second time in his career. The first was last March 17 against Philadelphia. Siakam came in with three games of 30-plus points already compared to just five last season.","401160724"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Having lost two more starters to injury earlier in the day, Golden State coach Steve Kerr was in a remarkably pleasant mood considering his team's fifth loss in six games to start the season. Considering everything that's happened so far, Kerr had good reason to smile. The depleted and mostly inexperienced Warriors put together their best collective effort of the season and held a late lead before making a few costly errors down the stretch of a 93-87 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Baby steps, at the very least. ""Our guys played fantastic basketball and fought like crazy, and then their coach decided to screw things up at the end,"" Kerr said. ""We were right there. A couple things at the end if we could have executed a little bit better and if I maybe made a couple different decisions I think we would have been in good shape. Tough one but I'm really, really proud of the group."" Kerr hasn't had a whole lot to smile about this season, especially after his day began with news that Draymond Green will miss at least a few games with a torn ligament in his left index finger. D'Angelo Russell was also missing from Saturday's game due to an ankle injury. That left the Warriors looking more like a G League team than one that had won three titles in four years from 2015-18. Golden State was so short-handed that Kerr jokingly asked a reporter before the game about his availability to play. Turns out the Warriors, at least this version of the Warriors, did pretty well on their own for the most part. Terry Rozier made a short go-ahead jumper then added two free throws with 4.9 seconds left after missing three straight to help Charlotte hold on. Dwayne Bacon scored 25 points while Rozier finished with 20 points and seven assists to help the Hornets win their second straight after back-to-back losses to the Lakers and Clippers. Rozier felt Charlotte might have overlooked Golden State because of the Warriors' injuries. ""I feel like we didn't come out and treat it like we were playing the Lakers or Clippers just because of everything that has happened over there,"" Rozier said. ""We found a way to win. It was ugly, but we were able to pull it out in the end."" Erich Paschall had a season-high 25 points for Golden State (1-5) while starting in place of the injured Green. ""I feel like we took a good step in the right direction as a team,"" Paschall said. ""Even though everybody's out, just having fun. Today we did a good job of just going out there and having fun."" Kerr was forced to use his sixth different lineup in as many games as a result of the injuries. The new-look Warriors seemed to relish the opportunity early, scoring a season-high 30 points in the first quarter. But Golden State went cold down the stretch, was limited to two baskets over the final three minutes and committed a critical turnover trying to inbound the ball with 25 seconds remaining. ""We were trying to get an action out of that, something to try to free up somebody, but it didn't work out,"" Kerr said. Charlotte (3-3) trailed entering the fourth quarter but went on a quick run capped by Malik Monk's follow shot to take an 80-75 lead. Damion Lee's 3-pointer with 1:55 left tied it at 86, and Paschall added a free throw that put the Warriors ahead. But Rozier, who shot 8 of 17, made an 11-foot jumper. Rozier then missed two free throws, but Cody Martin made one and Rozier came back to make two more. TIP-INS Hornets: Miles Bridges had two points on 1 of 10 shooting . Charlotte was 1 of 11 on 3-pointers in the first half . Nicolas Batum sat out a fifth straight game with a fractured left finger. Warriors: Paschall has scored 20 or more in both games he started this season ... Green and Russell were both injured during Friday's loss to San Antonio. Green will be re-evaluated Monday.","401160725"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Philadelphia's Furkan Korkmaz was just as stunned as anyone by his game-winning 3-pointer against the Portland Trail Blazers. Korkmaz hit his 3 with just 0.4 seconds left and the unbeaten 76ers rallied for their fifth straight victory, 129-128 on Saturday night. ""I didn't know how to feel or how to act. It was the biggest shot of my career,"" he said. Anfernee Simons made a corner 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds left to put Portland in front but the Sixers got the ball back after a timeout to set up Korkmaz's falling-down, 24-footer for the win -- without suspended center Joel Embiid. The 76ers are the last undefeated team in the league with their first 5-0 start since the 2000-01 season, when they opened with 10 straight victories en route to the Eastern Conference championship. The Blazers led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter but the Sixers closed the gap to 103-100 on Raul Neto's driving layup with just over 10 minutes left. Damian Lillard's 3-pointer with five minutes to go put Portland up 121-113. Portland's Rodney Hood, who finished with 25 points, left the game with 4:29 left after he tangled with Tobias Harris. It appeared that Hood injured his left knee. Ben Simmons and Al Horford made back-to-back dunks to pull Philadelphia within 125-124. Mario Hezonja fouled Simmons with 10.1 seconds left and he made both to give the Sixers the lead. Korkmaz called his 3 to win it a ""dream come true."" ""We were working on that in practice. I knew that if I was open I would take the shot. That was my mentality when I was going in,"" he said. Said Simmons: ""As soon as I saw Furk open -- I think he was shocked he was that open -- I trusted Furk to make that shot."" Horford finished with 25 points and Harris added 23. Simmons had 18 points and 11 rebounds. Lillard had 33 points, including eight of Portland's 19 3-pointers. ""We played such a great game and they just chipped away, got back into it and we let one slip,"" Lillard said. ""I think the way we lost sucks. Any time anybody hits a last-second shot, and puts you up against the clock, it's a bad feeling. "" Embiid was serving the first of a two-game suspension for an altercation with Karl-Anthony Towns during the 76ers' 117-95 home victory Wednesday over the Timberwolves. Both were ejected from the game and Towns was also suspended for a pair of games. Embiid was averaging 25.3 points and 10.3 rebounds to start the season. Rookie Matisse Thybulle got his second start of the season for the Sixers, but Korkmaz started the second half. The Blazers said before the game that center Hassan Whiteside would not be available because of a left knee bone bruise. That put Portland in a tough position because Zach Collins was already out with a dislocated shoulder. Fellow big man Pau Gasol was still rehabbing from offseason foot surgery and Jusuf Nukic isn't due back until the new year after his breaking his leg last season. Whiteside was averaging 12.8 points and 12.2 rebounds with the Blazers in the team's first five games. Portland started Anthony Tolliver and Hezonja up top against the Sixers, along with Hood. The Blazers led 32-27 going into the second quarter, with Hezonja leading the way with 10 points. Philadelphia tied it at 45 midway through the quarter on James Ennis III's 3-pointer. But the Sixers could not pull in front and Hood made back-to-back 3-pointers and Lillard added another to put the Blazers up 60-48. Portland led by 68-57 at the break and Lillard's 3-pointer extended Portland's lead to 93-72. Philadelphia closed the gap with a 12-point run that narrowed Portland's lead to 102-98 with 10:48 left in the game.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  His sixth NBA season has been a slow transition in getting acclimated with a new team, so T.J. Warren admittedly was pressing too much. On a Sunday night when the Indiana Pacers had a makeshift lineup with three injured starters sidelined, Warren adjusted well to playing a more prominent role with a season-high 26 points in a 108-95 home win over Chicago. ""It's definitely been a process,"" said Warren, acquired in the offseason after five years with Phoenix. ""I'm just trying to figure out how I can fit in and where I can be effective on this team. It's a whole new system with guys who have been together for like a month and a half now. We're still learning each other."" Warren, a 14.4-point scorer with the Suns, was averaging 12.8 points for the Pacers (3-3) after a humbling 3-point effort on 1-of-8 shooting in a Friday home win over Cleveland. But this night the shots were falling from the outset as he scored 14 first-half points to help the Pacers take a 13-point lead at the break. ""It's more just him trying to find his rhythm and get a feel for where his opportunities are coming,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""We're still early. It's going to take some time with this group getting a feel for each other."" A Pacers squad already missing its best player -- All-Star guard Victor Oladipo has yet to make his season debut in his recovery from knee surgery -- was also without forward/center Myles Turner (ankle) and center Domantas Sabonis (calf contusion). That meant McMillan was tinkering with lineups he hadn't even tried in practice, but they worked as the Pacers won their third straight game and sixth in a row against the Bulls (2-5). ""Guys have to be ready to step up and play when that opportunity presents itself,"" McMillan said. ""I thought tonight, as a group, we did."" Point guard Malcom Brogdon had 22 points and seven of the Pacers' team-high 28 assists. ""Having Victor out, you know the type of player he is as an All-Star, and still being able to win games and put it together, it's been huge for us,"" Brogdon said. ""But to have Myles and Domas out and still get this win, it's huge for our confidence."" Reserve forward TJ Leaf took advantage of extra minutes as a backup center with his second career double-double, 13 points and 15 rebounds. The third-year pro had entered with seasonal averages of 2.8 points and 2.5 rebounds. The Bulls (2-5), winless in five road games, lamented a lost opportunity against an opponent missing key players. ""We've been the short-handed team that went out and scrapped it and junkyard-dogged it and beat teams that maybe we shouldn't have beaten,"" said Bulls coach Jim Boylen. ""We haven't been the team that's favored very often. And maybe that's the lesson we've got to learn, that whether you're favored or not, or whether they're hurt or not, you've got to bring it."" Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 21 points and Wendell Carter Jr. added 20. ""We've got to take advantage of opportunities like this,"" said Bulls reserve forward Thaddeus Young, who had 12 points. ""I told the team in the postgame meeting this is what we call a trap game. We just didn't take advantage."" TIP-INS Bulls: LaVine joined select company on Friday in his 93rd game in bumping his career point total to 2,020.

"MIAMI -- The game wasn't over after 16 minutes. Forgive Miami and Houston if they felt otherwise. Duncan Robinson scored 23 points, Meyers Leonard added 21 and the Heat -- fueled by one of the biggest first-quarter margins in NBA history -- ran out to a 59-18 lead on the way to an easy 129-100 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night. ""Surprising? Not surprising to me,"" Leonard said. ""Don't get it twisted. The Houston Rockets are incredibly talented. But we came in with a game plan and a mindset that we were going to take away what they're good at, be disciplined and execute. That's what we did."" Jimmy Butler scored 18 points and had nine assists for the Heat, and James Johnson scored 17 in his season debut. Miami is 5-1, matching the best six-game start in franchise history. James Harden scored 29 for Houston, while Russell Westbrook was held to only 10. Westbrook also posted a career-worst -46 plus/minus. His previous worst was -36 at Washington on Feb. 13, 2017, according to ESPN's Stats &amp; Information. The Heat had 38 assists to Houston's 19, and the Rockets were just 14 of 48 from 3-point range. ""We're not in trouble,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said after his team fell to 3-3. ""But if we think we're not in trouble, then we're in trouble -- if that makes sense. You've got to have that appropriate fear and understand that it's a new year and you don't start with any games and we've got to work our way back."" It was a record-setting opening quarter for the Heat -- resulting in the third-biggest lead after 12 minutes in the NBA's shot-clock era, starting with the 1954-55 season. Miami led 46-14 after that first quarter. The only bigger leads after one quarter since the shot clock was put into play came when the Los Angeles Lakers led the Sacramento Kings 40-4 after one quarter on Feb. 4, 1987, and the Baltimore Bullets leading the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 45-12 after one quarter on Dec. 9, 1972. ""They came out and blitzed us,"" Harden said. ""They brought energy and effort that we couldn't match. And it showed."" It was the biggest margin by which the Heat had outscored an opponent in any quarter -- and the biggest margin by which the Rockets had ever been outscored in a period. Miami outscored New York by 28 in the first quarter on Jan. 22, 2007; the then-San Diego Rockets were outscored by 28 against Atlanta in the third quarter on Feb. 11, 1970. The lead was 59-18 four minutes into the second quarter. Houston got within 25 points by halftime, but no closer from there. ""The energy, I don't have many complaints,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Guys really brought it tonight."" Goran Dragic scored 15 points and Tyler Herro had 12 for Miami. Chris Clemons had 16 and Ben McLemore scored 14 for Houston. TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook started 1 for 9 from the field, 0 for 5 from 3-point range -- with his first make from beyond the arc coming on a 45-footer that beat the third-quarter buzzer. That got Houston within 99-71. ... The Rockets have faced deficits of at least 13 points in four consecutive games -- the other three falling well shy of the 41-point hole Houston quickly dug Sunday. ... Houston has now lost 13 of its last 17 games in Miami, and trails the all-time series with the Heat 33-32. Heat: Miami had a 48-point quarter at New York in 1989 and a 47-point quarter at Boston in 1990. The 46-point quarter was a Heat home record. ... Chris Bosh and Ray Allen -- who teamed up for one of the biggest plays in NBA Finals history, the rebound and 3-pointer late in Game 6 of the 2013 series against San Antonio -- were in attendance. So was Dorell Wright, part of the 2006 Heat NBA championship team. ... Justise Winslow (lower back stiffness) missed his second consecutive game. Derrick Jones Jr. (left groin) and KZ Okpala (left Achilles) were inactive. HARDEN'S SHOOTING Harden was 6 for 14 from the field and 3 for 9 from 3-point range -- not great numbers for an elite scorer like him, but his percentages for the season actually rose. He's up to 37% from the field now through six games, 22% from 3-point range. All-time in Miami, Harden is shooting 39% from the field, 33% from beyond the arc. CLEMONS DEBUTS Clemons, the third-leading scorer in NCAA Division I men's history and someone who averaged 30.1 per game as a senior at Campbell last season, made his NBA debut. Clemons scored 3,225 points in 130 college games, and was 5 for 18 from the floor Sunday.","401160728"
"NEW YORK --  The Sacramento Kings left home on a high note and are feeling even better after their first stop on the road. De'Aaron Fox scored 24 points, Buddy Hield had 22 and the Kings routed the New York Knicks 113-92 on Sunday night for their second straight victory following a 0-5 start. Harrison Barnes added 19 points and Richaun Holmes finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings, who brought the momentum from their 102-101 home victory over Utah on Friday east and ran away from the Knicks. ""It's kind of important to come out with a good start, especially flying across the country,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""I was very happy with our guys' effort level, performance level."" Sacramento led by as many as 32 points in a surprisingly simple start to a three-game road trip. Nemanja Bjelica chipped in 10 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and the Kings limited the Knicks to 38% shooting. ""I think it was our defense,"" Fox said. ""I think obviously you have to put the ball in the basket, but the way we've performed I think the last three or four games have been fantastic."" Marcus Morris scored 28 points for the Knicks, who dropped their third straight and fell to 1-6. Rookie RJ Barrett had 22 points. ""I really expected us to take a step forward tonight, but we didn't,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. Sacramento led by nine after one quarter, then opened the second with an 11-0 run to build a 43-23 lead on Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer with 7:34 remaining in the half. New York didn't score until more than five minutes had elapsed in the period, and after clawing back within 12 later in the quarter, promptly gave up the next nine points as the Kings pushed the lead to 55-34. ""You don't want that type of result or effort coming in after we had two extremely hard-fought games on the road that we gave ourselves a chance to win,"" forward Julius Randle said. ""Tonight we came in and we didn't give ourselves a chance at all."" A 61-41 halftime lead quickly was expanded to 76-44 on Fox's jumper, and boos broke out during a third quarter that ended with Sacramento ahead 90-64. TIP-INS Kings: Luke Walton's pregame interview with reporters was attended by a couple special guests. His father Bill, a Hall of Fame player, stood in the back along with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead. Both wore Kings sweatshirts. ""In the NBA season you're on the road a lot, so any time you can have family and friends around, it's a nice mini break,"" Luke Walton said. ""But they know and we know we're here for business. We're here to try to get better as a team and try to win a game."" ... The Kings have won the last four meetings. Knicks: Second-round pick Ignas Brazdeikis made his NBA debut in the fourth quarter. He scored four points. ... Fizdale changed up his starting lineup, inserting Bobby Portis at center in place of Mitchell Robinson. Portis scored two points. Robinson had 10. ... The Knicks remained short-handed in the backcourt, with point guards Elfrid Payton (strained right hamstring) and Dennis Smith Jr. (personal reasons) still out. FATHER KNOWS BEST Though Bill Walton has been a popular TV broadcaster and is known for his loquaciousness, he picks and chooses his spots when it comes to talking to his son about the game. ""My dad's been great my whole basketball career, whether I was a player or now into coaching,"" Luke Walton said. ""He offers advice when I want it and he knows when to leave me alone. So he's a great person to be able to talk to and communicate about the game, what he sees, but he also knows that this is my job and I'm doing it. So, when and when not to put his voice in there."" ROUGH FOR RANDLE Randle was limited to eight points and seven rebounds on 4-for-13 shooting. He has been in single digits in scoring the last two games after opening the season with five straight double-doubles.","401160729"
"SAN ANTONIO --  For a player who wasn't even part of the Los Angeles Lakers' plans this offseason, Dwight Howard is providing a powerful impact alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Davis had 25 points and 11 rebounds, ames added 21 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds and Los Angeles held off the San Antonio Spurs 103-96 on Sunday night. Howard had 14 points and 13 rebounds in a throw-back performance to help the Lakers improve to 5-1. He was 7 for 7 from the field. ""Just effort and energy,"" Howard said. ""(James and Davis) are going to take most of the scoring bulk, so my job is just to make sure I clean up all the mistakes. On the defensive end, be a force, make guys take tough shots and be aggressive. I enjoy it."" Dejounte Murray had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Spurs, Rudy Gay added 16 points off the bench, and DeMar DeRozan had 14. They lost for the second time in three games to drop to 4-2. James also had a triple-double Friday night in an overtime victory in Dallas. The Spurs rallied in the fourth just as the Mavericks did in forcing overtime, but this time Howard put a stop to rally in regulation. Howard missed all but nine games last season with the Washington Wizards after suffering a knee injury. The 15-year veteran remained an unsigned free agent until August when the Lakers took a chance after DeMarcus Cousins was lost for the season with a knee injury. The signing has been huge for Los Angeles, which has the best record in the Western Conference. ""Any time he's on the floor, he always seems to do something huge for us,"" Davis said. Howard had 10 points, six rebounds and two blocks in the fourth quarter. The Spurs closed to 77-72 on Gay's 37-footer to end the third quarter and 87-85 on Murray's short jumper midway through the fourth. Murray finished 7 for 12 from the field. ""He is like a young pup,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said, ""and he is trying to figure it out. He's got speed, he's aggressive and, at the same time, he's trying to learn to run the show and find people and take good shots."" Murray's three-point play on a foul against James and subsequent driving layup tied it at 90 with 4:10 remaining. The Lakers went on a 7-0 run, capped by a dunk follow by Howard. The center flexed after the basket to the roar of the many Los Angeles fans in attendance. ""Dwight Howard was huge,"" James said. ""Every minute that he played. Great performance by him, crashing the glass, catching lobs, getting great strips defensively, giving us extra possessions. He was vintage tonight in the minutes that he played."" The Lakers missed their first three shots and had two turnovers but the Spurs only managed a 5-0 lead. The teams combined to commit 13 turnovers in the first quarter in a sloppy start to a battle between the early leaders in the Western Conference standings. The Spurs were 4 for 16 on 3-pointers in the first half and finished 6 for 25 on 3s. ""Defense, that's our staple,"" James said. ""We've been talking about it and we believe it. No matter how it's going for us offensively. If we're struggling to shoot the ball, if we turn the ball over, we have to still continue to get stops and we did that tonight in a very hostile environment. An environment that's very tough to win in, I know from experience. It's a very good win for us early in the second."" The Lakers outscored the Spurs 30-18 in the second quarter, including an alley-oop from Howard at the 3-point line to Davis. TIP-INS Lakers: James won at the AT&amp;T Center for the first time since 2015. . Lakers fan Calvin Broadus, aka Snoop Dog, sat courtside. He received a Spurs jersey with Snoop Dogg and No. 19 on the back, which he sheepishly accepted while wearing a purple Lakers jacket. ...

Spurs: Derrick White fell on his right hip and backside early in the fourth quarter after being fouled by Dwight Howard. Derrick White remained on the court for about 45 seconds before rising and gingerly walking off the injury. Officials reviewed the play and ruled it was a common foul against Howard. HAVING FUN Howard is relishing every moment with the Lakers after missing most of last season with a knee injury. ""Being injured sitting at home, watching basketball watching TV and stuff like that is kind of hard,"" Howard said. ""So, I promised myself when I got back on the court I was going to have the most fun as I can but enjoy the moment and try to help my team win whatever situation I might be put in.""","401160730"

"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard showed just how much of a difference he can make for the Los Angeles Clippers. Leonard scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Clippers to a 105-94 victory over the Utah Jazz on Sunday night. Last Wednesday at Utah, the Jazz beat the Clippers by 15 points with Leonard sitting out. The following night, Leonard returned to the lineup and scored 38 points in a win over San Antonio. ""Great job, the last two games we just grinded out physical, hard playing defensive games,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I guess that's what Kawhi can do, really. I thought Kawhi and Lou Williams started running some good stuff together and we're going to get better and better at it."" Against the Jazz, Leonard helped the Clippers erase a double-digit second-half deficit and remain unbeaten (4-0) at home. He shot just 9 for 26, but with the score tied at 86, Leonard scored six points to key a 19-8 run to close out the victory. ""I think it's just about taking advantage of the moment and not shying away,"" Leonard said. ""You're not gonna make every shot that you shoot to win a game or every shot in the fourth quarter, so to me it's about keep being aggressive and keep having fun."" Montrezl Harrell. Who had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Clippers, was also singing Leonard's praises. ""Kawhi is a winner,"" Harrell said. ""He's a superstar and he knows how to win. He's won multiple big stages."" Six of Harrell's rebounds were on the offensive end and came at a critical point in the game down the stretch.

We kept finding ways to get the ball and give ourselves an extra possession."" Williams added 17 points for the Clippers Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 36 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 19. ""We made lots of little mess-ups and screw-ups late in the fourth quarter and that cost us the game,"" Mitchell said.

After trailing by eight points in the opening quarter, the Clippers opened the second on a 20-4 run. Landry Shamet's 3-pointer gave Los Angeles a 36-24 lead with 4:53 to go. The Jazz responded with a 17-3 run to finish the quarter and Mitchell's basket in the final minute gave Utah a 41-39 lead at the break. Both teams shot under 35 percent in the opening half. Leonard shot 1 for 9 in the first half and scored only five points. LAC outrebounded the Utah 54-37 in the game and forced 14 turnovers. ""The difference was that they were able to get offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter,"" said Jazz coach Quin Snyder, whose team has dropped two straight. ""If you don't get defensive rebounds, it's a killer."" TIP-INS Jazz: Utah coach Quin Snyder served as an assistant for the Clippers for the 1992-93 season.

"WASHINGTON --  Knowing he's the on- and off-court leader of a revamped roster filled with youth and inexperience, Bradley Beal was pleased to see the way his Washington Wizards reacted to what he called ""laying an egg."" One game after a lackluster loss, the Wizards ended Detroit star Andre Drummond's 20-20 streak and picked up their second victory of the young season, beating the depleted Pistons 115-99 in a half-empty arena Monday night. ""Still a lot of things we've got to work on, get better at,"" said Beal, who had 22 points and six assists. ""But it is definitely a good sign to see, after last game."" Two nights earlier, Washington was beaten by 22 points at home by the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were missing the suspended Karl-Anthony Towns. So what if Detroit was without Blake Griffin (left hamstring and knee), Derrick Rose (right hamstring) and Reggie Jackson (lower back)? ""It's the NBA. There are no excuses,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We got enough guys in that room to compete, to fight."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who doesn't have All-Star point guard John Wall, was thrilled with the way his players responded to the criticism they heard during film study of the Timberwolves game. ""We were disappointed. We were. There's no way around it. It was a bad night on both ends of the floor,"" Brooks said. ""One thing I love about it: We came back. We took it on the chin. ... We needed them to get better from it. Sometimes when you have a team that doesn't have a lot of experience, a loss is a loss if you don't learn anything from it."" The Wizards improved to 2-4 thanks to 14 points and seven rebounds from Thomas Bryant, and nine points and six assists from Isaiah Thomas in his first start of the season. Rookie Rui Hachimura bounced back from his worst game as a pro with 10 first-quarter points for Washington and ended up with 12 points and four rebounds. In the previous game, Hachimura -- the first Japanese player taken in the opening round of the NBA draft -- shot just 2 for 11 and had season lows of four points and two rebounds. One key Monday was that Drummond did not continue to fill the stat sheet the way he has been. Bidding to become the first player in at least 35 seasons to post four consecutive games with 20 or more points and 20 or more rebounds, he got there in one of the categories, finishing with 15 points and 24 rebounds. Drummond shot 6 of 20, going 1 of 8 in the fourth quarter as Washington pulled away. ""We just tried to make everything difficult for him. Try and get into his airspace,"" Bryant said. ""Try and make everything super-hard for him."" At halftime, Washington was up by only 63-61. But the Wizards pulled away in the third quarter, and a layup by Troy Brown Jr. in the last minute of that period got their lead up to 93-75. ""They out-scrapped us,"" Casey said. ""Outworked us.""

"NEW YORK --  Brandon Ingram had the best game of his career. The New Orleans Pelicans had the best quarter in their history. Somehow, the Brooklyn Nets found a way to win on a night when the hits kept on coming. ""We took a combination, a haymaker, however you want to call it, couple left hooks in the jaw in the third quarter, and I thought in the fourth quarter we did a better job and slowed them down a little,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Kyrie Irving had 39 points and nine assists, and Brooklyn withstood Ingram's career-high 40 points to beat the Pelicans 135-125 on Monday. The Nets had 67 points at halftime and a 20-point lead in the third quarter, but could never get comfortable until the final minute as Ingram kept coming at them. He shot 17 for 24 from the field in his first 40-point game and the Pelicans scored a franchise-record 48 points in the third quarter. They got within two in the fourth but could never get enough stops to catch the Nets. ""I just felt like I was in rhythm. Still missed some layups. Still missed some 3s. I could have (done) better,"" Ingram said. Caris LeVert added 23 points, Joe Harris had 19 and Jarrett Allen finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who follow this game with a five-game road trip, their longest of the season, with the first four in the West. ""We obviously wanted to come out and win this game and really put a statement down for the rest of the week before we go on this long trip, so it was good,"" Irving said. Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball each scored 15 points and Josh Hart had 14 for the Pelicans, who fell to 1-6. Brooklyn led by only two after Ingram's three-point play with 4:58 remaining in the half, but the Nets scored 10 straight. Five of them came in one trip when Allen made two free throws after being flagrantly fouled by Ingram -- he actually made the shot while being thrown to the ground, but the foul had been called on the floor -- and Garrett Temple made a 3-pointer after Brooklyn retained possession. Brooklyn later got consecutive jumpers by Irving and a dunk from Spencer Dinwiddie to close a 20-3 run and make it 63-44. Irving scored 18 points in the third but the Pelicans were a sizzling 8 for 11 from 3-point range and scored 48 points, trimming a 20-point deficit to 104-98 heading to the fourth. ""We decided to play 20 minutes in a 48-minute game and that doesn't work out. At least it hasn't in the 31 years I've been in the NBA,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Their previous best was 47 points in a quarter, and their best third quarter was 41 points. ... Ingram played just 13 minutes in his previous game against Oklahoma City on Saturday because of a head injury. Nets: DeAndre Jordan limped off early in the fourth quarter with a sprained left ankle after appearing to step on JJ Redick's foot while running down the court. ... Irving has scored at least 20 points in all seven games. The longest streak of 20-point games to open a season by a Nets player belongs to Richard Jefferson, who did it in eight straight in 2007-08.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Houston Rockets didn't let Sunday's anemic performance at Miami carry over into the second night of a back-to-back. With James Harden leading the way with 44 points, Houston was much more solid on Monday night, beating the Memphis Grizzlies 107-100. After the game, many of the Rockets referenced the 129-100 loss to the Heat, in which Houston trailed by 41 points in the first half. ""We got smacked in the mouth in the first quarter. That should leave a mark,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game.

The former MVP finished 12 of 28 from the field, including 7 of 16 from 3-point range. He added 10 rebounds and six assists. Harden said a better energy level contributed to a better performance. ""When you bring energy to the game, good things happen for you and for our team,"" Harden said. ""If you don't bring energy (and) you're not active, good things won't happen. That's what happened (Sunday) night."" Eric Gordon added 16 points, while Danuel House Jr. scored 15. Clint Capela had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Rookie Ja Morant led Memphis with 23 points and six assists. Dillon Brooks scored 17 points. Jonas Valanciunas had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Morant was 10 of 16 from the field. There were 15 ties and seven lead changes, and the game was tied at 70 midway through the third period. Memphis, which has seen leads dwindle with poor second-half performances, saw Houston score 11 straight points, including six by Harden, to break the tie and build a cushion. Memphis never got closer than six points the rest of the way. ""Tough third quarter, in a sense, for both teams,"" Memphis first-year coach Taylor Jenkins said, ""but I really liked the way our guys competed in the second half."" TIP-INS Rockets: Closed out a four-game trip at 2-2. ... Have reached at least 60 points in the first half in four of eight games this season. ... Harden has 40-plus points in four straight games against the Grizzlies. ... D'Antoni challenged a foul against Ben McLemore in the fourth quarter, but officials upheld the call after review. Grizzlies: F Jaren Jackson Jr. (right knee soreness) and G Grayson Allen (left ankle) sat out the game. Both left Saturday's loss to Phoenix in the third quarter. ... With Jackson out, rookie Brandon Clarke made his first NBA start. ... Dillon Brooks grabbed a career-high nine rebounds. ... Memphis trailed at halftime for the second time this season. ... Were called for five technical fouls in the game. ... Were outscored 22-16 in the third. Memphis has not won a third quarter this season. ROOKIE RECORDS Morant has scored 117 points this season, the most by a Grizzlies rookie in his first six games. He also is the first rookie since the team moved to Memphis in 2001 to record consecutive games with at least 20 points and five assists. ""He's a beast, man,"" Harden said of the second overall pick in this year's draft. ""He's aggressive. As a young guy in this league, some guys tend to be nervous. He has no nerves at all."" TESTY TIMES The game got testy with about two minutes left when Grizzlies forward Jae Crowder appeared to take a shot to the groin while guarding Harden. After the foul was called on Crowder, Harden and the Grizzlies exchanged words, leading to a technical against Crowder along with ejection. Harden was called for a flagrant-1 foul after a review by officials. LAST WORD ""It was better, but it was so bad (Sunday) night. So, the bar was really low."" -- D'Antoni.","401160735"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The start to the game was unusual. Giannis Antetokounmpo's final stat line was not. After waiting out a long delay, Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 15 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 134-106 on Monday night. Antetokounmpo, the reigning NBA MVP, has posted a double-double in all seven games this season. ""Once you go out there, you have a mindset that you're going to play a game, you're going to go hard,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Once you cannot go hard, you've got to almost switch mindsets."" The game was delayed 50 minutes so one of the baskets could be fixed before tipoff. During pregame warmups, the rim the Bucks were shooting on was discovered to be crooked. ""I was making shots,"" Antetokounmpo joked. ""So I was happy. Once they said the rim is crooked, I was like, `Oh yeah, that's why I was making a lot of shots.' Yeah, it was disturbing, because everybody was ready to go. We had to wait, like, probably, what was it, an hour?"" If the Bucks were thrown off by the delay, it didn't show. Milwaukee shot 53.8 percent from the field. Khris Middleton added 26 points to match his season high, and Eric Bledsoe set a season best with 22. Bledsoe also had nine rebounds and six assists. ""There's just no excuses,"" Middleton said. ""We just had to stay professional and be as ready as we could."" Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 25 points. Minnesota played without center Karl-Anthony Towns, who served the second game of his two-game suspension for his part in an altercation with Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid last week. Robert Covington added 15 points. The Bucks outscored the Towns-less Timberwolves 62-38 in the paint. ""They're a good team,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""You know, the credit goes to them. They overwhelmed us a little bit in the third quarter."" Milwaukee broke open the game with a 38-point third that included a 22-6 run. Antetokounmpo scored 11 points and grabbed five rebounds in the period. ""We didn't make shots. We got stagnant,"" Covington said. ""We didn't come out with the urgency that we know we needed to. Just too much playing catch-up."" The Bucks were up seven at halftime thanks in part to coach Mike Budenholzer winning a coach's challenge with 0.2 seconds left in the second quarter. That overturned an offensive foul on Antetokounmpo and resulted in a layup for him. Donte DiVincenzo scored a season-best 17 off the bench for Milwaukee. ""A little bit of a strange night between the beginning and different things during the game,"" Budenholzer said. ""I thought the guys had a great focus. I thought the third quarter was really good."" TIP-INS Bucks guards Wesley Matthews and Pat Connaughton returned to action. Connaughton (right shoulder strain) sat out Saturday's win over Toronto, while Matthews injured his ankle Saturday and played only nine minutes. Timberwolves center Gorgui Dieng made his second consecutive start in place of the suspended Towns. Backup point guard Shabazz Napier left in the fourth quarter with a strained right hamstring. He is day-to-day. KILLING TIME The Bucks spent the delay in the locker room, telling stories about odd events they'd experienced in their careers or watched on TV. ""The first thing that came to mind for me was back when prime Shaq was breaking backboards every other game,"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said.","401160736"
"PHOENIX -- Devin Booker was pouring in buckets from every corner of the court during the second half, and the home crowd loved every minute of it, serenading the Phoenix Suns star with MVP chants as he finished with 40 points in a 114-109 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. The 23-year-old guard did a lot of losing during his first four seasons in the desert. That's why these moments -- even though it's very early in year five -- are feeling awfully good. ""That's the love I get here. It's been unconditional since Day 1,'' Booker said. ""It's good to feel the energy in there. The fans are getting what they want -- a hard-working team that pushes the issue every night.'' Phoenix (5-2) continued its run as one of the most surprising teams in the NBA, knocking off the previously undefeated 76ers, who played without star center Joel Embiid because of his two-game suspension for an altercation with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns on Oct. 30. Ricky Rubio added 21 points and 10 assists for the Suns, who are three games over .500 for the first time in more than four years. Phoenix is on a three-game winning streak and off to its best seven-game start since 2013. The Suns are also now 7-0 against the spread this season. They're the fifth team in the past 30 seasons to cover each of its first seven games of a season and the first to do it since the 2015-16 Orlando Magic. Booker now has 6,003 points in his career, becoming the eighth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 6,000. He turned 23 last week and finished Monday's game 15-of-19 from the field, including 3-for-4 from 3-point range, and 7-of-7 on free throws. ""I've said it for a while: He's a complete basketball player,'' Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""He's competitive, not afraid of the moment. He makes big plays.'' Phoenix pushed ahead 100-93 midway through the final quarter, but the lead quickly disappeared and Al Horford tied the game when he came flying down the lane for a one-handed, putback slam. From that point, it was back and forth until the Suns went up in the final few minutes when Booker and Kelly Oubre Jr. made big baskets to put them in front for good. The Sixers (5-1) were led by 32 points from Horford. He tied a career high with five 3-pointers and shot 13-of-20 from the field. Tobias Harris added 24 points and Furkan Korkmaz had 20. ""We have to definitely give them credit,'' Harris said. ""They came out and played a heck of a game. They were able to make shots.'' Horford nailed a 27-foot 3 at the buzzer to put the 76ers ahead 61-55 at halftime. The 13-year veteran shot 6-of-7 from the field in the first half, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range. ""For the last couple of games, obviously with Joel being out, I felt like I've had to step up a little more, be more aggressive and look to score,'' Horford said. ""Tonight, the way they were defending me, it gave me a lot of looks, and I took advantage of that.'' A BIG DIFFERENCE SO FAR Phoenix won its fifth game, which is already more than 25 percent of the way to its win total of 19 last season. The Suns haven't made the playoffs in a decade and have been particularly bad over the past four years, with an 87-241 record and no more than 24 wins in any of those seasons. TIP-INS 76ers: G/F Shake Milton didn't play because of a bone bruise and mild sprain in his left knee. ... Ben Simmons had five steals in the first half and finished with seven. ... Embiid is eligible to return when the 76ers visit the Jazz on Wednesday. Suns: G Ty Jerome missed his seventh straight game to start his rookie season because of a right ankle sprain. ... The Suns trailed by six at halftime despite shooting 55% from the field. ... Booker scored the Suns' first 11 points of the third quarter and had 16 in the period. ...

"SAN FRANCISCO --  Those familiar chants of ""M-V-P!"" weren't for Stephen Curry this time but rather a rookie named Eric Paschall, who delivered a special performance on his 23rd birthday. Not to mention the Warriors' first win at new Chase Center -- finally. Paschall hit a key 3-pointer with 4:05 remaining and finished with 34 points and 13 rebounds, leading injury-plagued Golden State to a 127-118 victory over Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. ""That was a little crazy. For a rookie you hear MVP, that's a `wow' moment,"" Paschall said. ""I thank Dub Nation for believing in me."" Without all their injured stars, the young Warriors more than hung tough against a Western Conference contender as Klay Thompson cheered from the sideline. Golden State (2-5) improved to 1-4 at home -- the team hasn't started 0-5 in its own building since losing its initial six home games in 1997-98. ""Just a fantastic effort by the whole group. Everybody that we put in came in and gave us big minutes,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""It was just fun. It's a fun group to coach because they're young and hungry and they were fighting like crazy out there the whole game. That's a good team they just beat. It was a great night for us."" Lillard, no longer playing in his hometown of Oakland when he visits the Bay Area, notched his fourth 30-point performance in the first seven games with 39 points on 15-for-26 shooting, including five 3-pointers. Blazers center Hassan Whiteside added 22 points and 11 rebounds after missing one game with a bone bruise in his left knee. Golden State, which swept Portland in the Western Conference finals last season on the way to a fifth straight NBA Finals, led 90-83 early in the fourth quarter before the Blazers fought back. ""They competed from the beginning, they played hard, they moved the ball really well,"" Lillard said. ""They played like a team that wanted to win. We got outplayed start to finish, I would say. We had some moments in the game, but we played like we just thought we were going to march in here and win the game, and they showed why they're in the NBA. That's a tough loss."" Paschall's late 3 put the Warriors ahead 107-99. Chants of ""M-V-P!"" greeted him when he shot free throws with 2:22 left. He also hit a pair of 3-pointers to start the game and made his initial 3 from deep. He scored 17 points in the opening period, and Paschall has scored 20 or more in all three games he has started. He had 25 in Golden State's loss to Charlotte on Saturday, becoming the first Warriors rookie with back-to-back games of 25 points since Curry had five in a row in April 2010, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ""He came in and didn't look like a rookie at all, from the first day of practice,"" Kerr said. Fellow rookie Ky Bowman had 19 points and eight assists for the Warriors, who faced their worst start since beginning the 2000-01 season 1-7.  But Golden State made five of its first eight shots to take an early 14-9 lead and kept bringing the energy and enthusiasm on both ends. Paschall and Bowman combined to shoot 20 for 33 -- 11 of 19 by Paschall. He also made all eight of his free throws. With 6:13 to go, Bowman drove to the basket and scored, then tangled with Whiteside, who pushed off with an elbow. Officials went to replay and issued Whiteside a technical. CJ McCollum had 14 points and six assists for the Blazers, whose previous four games were decided by a total of nine points, including a 129-128 home loss to the 76ers on Saturday. Kerr knew the terrific backcourt tandem of Lillard and McCollum provided a tough matchup. ""They're really tough to guard even for a veteran team. For a young group, we're probably going to learn some lessons tonight,"" Kerr said before the game. NO SPLASHING The Warriors improved to 3-10 without Splash Brothers Curry and Thompson, according to Elias -- 1-2 this season, 2-6 in 2018-19, 0-1 in 2016-17 and 0-1 in 2015-16. Playing without just Curry, Golden State is 44-68 since 2009-10, including 5-8 last season. FIRST RESPONDERS The Warriors hosted firefighters and first responders from the devastating Kincade Fire in Sonoma County.  They were shown on the big screen midway through the second quarter and drew cheers. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard has scored at least 20 points in eight straight games against the Warriors. ... The Blazers have played five of their seven games on the road. ... Lillard averaged 28.3 points and 6.5 assists in four regular-season games vs. Golden State last season, when the teams split four meetings. Warriors: Paschall became the first Warriors rookie with 17 or more points in a quarter since Reggie Williams had 18 in the fourth period against Phoenix on March 22, 2010, according to Elias. ... Draymond Green missed his second straight game with a torn ligament in his left index finger, while D'Angelo Russell also sat out his second consecutive game because of a sprained right ankle. Kerr hopes Russell will play Wednesday at Houston. F Kevon Looney, who missed his sixth game in a row because of neuropathy, hasn't received any answers yet on his condition and won't travel with the team to Houston on Tuesday, though Kerr said, ""I wouldn't rule him out of the whole trip.""","401160738"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Bismack Biyombo spent the better part of three quarters stretching and waiting on the Charlotte Hornets bench. The reserve center had a feeling his time was coming. ""I always say, `You gotta stay ready so you don't have to get ready,"" Biyombo said. ""You could tell by the momentum of the game that we were going to need some energy from somebody."" Devonte Graham scored a career-high 35 points, Biyombo provided a huge spark off the bench late and the Hornets battled back from a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Indiana Pacers 122-120 in overtime Tuesday night. Graham sank 2 of 3 free-throw attempts with 1.7 seconds left in overtime after drawing a foul on JaKarr Sampson, helping the Hornets win their third straight game. But it was Biyombo who changed the momentum when he entered to start the fourth quarter with the Hornets trailing 92-78. He made an immediate impact, scoring down low to start the quarter before coming up with a block against T.J. McConnell that led to a three-point play by Terry Rozier on a fast break. Biyombo then stole the ball at midcourt and went in for a one-handed dunk. He added several put-backs along the way, giving Charlotte a presence it badly needed on the glass. Biyombo finished with 15 points on 6 of 7 shooting, six rebounds and two blocks in 17 minutes. ""I thought Biz turned the game, just his energy, his defense ... he was all over the place,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. Graham added to a spectacular start to his second NBA season. When he wasn't getting steady updates from teammates on the Duke-Kansas college basketball season opener, he was making plays all over the court. He shot 11 of 20 and had four more 3-pointers, along with six assists, four rebounds and three steals. Graham struggled shooting from the outside on the team's four-game road trip but fixed that Tuesday night. ""Let me tell you, I stayed in the gym last night,"" Graham said. ""I came in early this morning, I was in the gym. I worked out more than usual."" Borrego called him a winner. ""To continue to play this way, to be poised and unfazed, he's grown right before our eyes,"" Borrego said. ""I trust him, believe in him and I think that's apparent. I think our guys do also. He's a special player."" Terry Rozier added 22 points and Miles Bridges had 18 for the Hornets (4-3). T.J. Warren scored 33 points on 15-of-18 shooting and Malcolm Brogdon added 31 points for the Pacers (3-4). But it was enough, as Indiana had its three-game winning streak snapped. Several Pacers mentioned the discrepancy in the foul count. ""They were the aggressors, they were marching to the free-throw line,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""They shot 42 free throws tonight and we only shot seven free throws. Offensively we had some opportunities and we didn't make plays. It comes down to making plays and getting stops and they did tonight."" TIP INS Pacers: Jeremy Lamb had 18 points in his return to Charlotte. ... Goga Bitadze and TJ Leaf both fouled out. ... Myles Turner (sprained ankle) and Domantas Sabonis (strained calf) continued to be held out while rehabbing injuries. Hornets: Rookie P.J. Washington suffered a lower left leg contusion, Borrego said. He continued his impressive season scoring 16 points, including a driving left-handed dunk over Sampson that brought the crowd to its feet. ... Graham, Biyombo and Rozier combined to score 40 of the team's last 42 points. THE NO-CALL McMillan didn't agree that Graham was fouled by Sampson with 1.7 seconds left in overtime. ""Devonte was driving a lot tonight and initiating the contact, I didn't feel that was a foul at all,"" McMillan said. ""He got two calls tonight that our guys had their hands up. He is initiating the contact and he got the free throws on that. We did get a lot of fouls this game, but I did not think that was a foul."" THE SAME FIVE The Hornets played the entire fourth quarter and overtime with the same five players -- Graham, Biyombo, Rozier, Bridges and Cody Martin. Martin didn't score in 33-plus minutes but had 11 rebounds and made a major impact on the game with his defense on Brogdon in the fourth quarter and overtime. Only Rozier and Bridges are regular starters.","401160739"
"CLEVELAND --  Gordon Hayward capped a perfect night from inside the arc with the biggest basket of the game. Hayward tied a career high with 39 points, making all 16 of his 2-point attempts, and the Boston Celtics won their fifth straight game by holding off the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113 on Tuesday. Hayward hit 17 of 20 shots, including one 3-pointer. He put in Kemba Walker's miss with 22 seconds left to give Boston a five-point lead. Walker stole the inbounds pass and sank a free throw to put the game away. The only person in the building who wasn't impressed with his perfection on 2-pointers was Hayward. ""It seems like a pointless stat to me,"" he said. ""Tonight just felt sweet because we got the win, but I wish we could have closed out better."" Celtics coach Brad Stevens took a different point of view. ""Certainly, you always felt like he could get a bucket at any time,"" Stevens said. ""He was aggressive going to the basket. He did a good job when guarded by big guys. He did a good job when guarded by small guys."" Walker had 25 points for Boston, which hasn't lost since the season opener against Philadelphia. ""That's pretty impressive,"" he said of Hayward's stat line. ""He made all his 2s and only missed three 3s. That's nuts."" Hayward scored 16 points in the opening quarter and 22 in the first half, hitting all nine attempts from the field. Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. had a simple assessment of the performance. ""He didn't miss,"" Nance said. ""He's crafty. He plays the game at a very cerebral level."" Hayward suffered a horrific leg injury in Cleveland during the opening minutes of the 2017-18 season opener. He averaged 16.5 points in two games at Cleveland last season. ""I don't think about it,"" Hayward said. ""I haven't thought about it for a while. Hopefully, you guys won't be asking about it again."" Collin Sexton, who scored 21 points, hit a 3 with 1:33 to play that cut Boston's lead to 116-113. The score remained that way until Hayward's crucial basket after his offensive rebound. ""Probably a case, I don't know what the film's going to show, ball-watching,"" Cavaliers forward Kevin Love said. ""I'd gone for the rebound and he just crashed weak side."" Boston was 48 of 85 from the field (56%). Jayson Tatum scored 18 points and Carson Edwards had 13. Tristan Thompson had 19 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland, which has lost three straight. Love scored 17 and Larry Nance Jr. 15. TIP-INS Celtics: C Enes Kanter (bruised left knee) missed his fifth straight game. Stevens said Kanter ""really wants to play, but our medical staff doesn't feel like he's ready yet."" ...

Getting to see my family is what I'm looking forward to."" SITTING OUT Cavaliers rookie Kevin Porter Jr. missed the game after being suspended by the NBA for bumping official Bill Spooner in Sunday's loss to Dallas. Porter brushed into Spooner's shoulder as he ran back down the floor after missing a shot at the end of the third quarter, knocking the official off balance. ""He was very contrite, very disappointed in himself,"" Cleveland coach John Beilien said. ""He apologized to the official right away. You cannot do that with the officials. You can't come close to them like that. I think we all realize that.""","401160740"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young came through just as the Atlanta Hawks were trying to put John Collins' suspension in perspective. Young scored 28 of his 29 points in the second half, Jabari Parker added 19 points and the Hawks moved past Collins' issues to snap a three-game losing streak with a 108-100 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night. Young, returning after missing one game with a right ankle sprain, put on some dazzling moves in the fourth quarter to help his team overcome the loss of Collins, who was suspended earlier in the day for 25 games without pay for a violation of the NBA's anti-drug program after testing positive for a growth hormone. ""Everybody stepped up in a big way,"" Young said. ""Like I say, we're going to miss John. He's a big piece of our team. It's not easy, but they did a great job. We've just got to take it game by game, but we did a good job today."" DeMar DeRozan scored 22 points, Bryn Forbes had 17 and Patty Mills 16 for the Spurs. San Antonio has dropped three of four. The 6-foot-1 Young put on a dribbling display that stopped 6-11 LaMarcus Aldridge cold, then zipped a brilliant pass from the right-side perimeter to a cutting DeAndre' Bembry for a dunk that put the Hawks up 95-88 with 4:52 remaining. Young had 13 assists. ""I cut to the rim as he was looking for someone to do,"" Bembry said. ""It was perfect timing. It was a great pass, a hell of a pass, and just made two points."" The crowd roared again after Young fell backward while hitting a 3 from the right corner to make it 104-96 with 2:11 remaining. It was a stark contrast from the first two quarters when Young was 0 for 8 from the field but had eight assists. ""He was cold in the first half and probably getting some rust off a little bit, I would imagine, but the second half he was great,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He played confidently, whether he was driving it for little runners or shooting the 3. He did a great job."" The Spurs led by eight entering the fourth but were outscored 38-22. Young, who went 5 for 10 beyond the arc, had 16 points in the final period. San Antonio led 45-44 at halftime with DeRozan, Mills and Parker each scoring 10 points. The Spurs were just 8 for 33 on 3s and missed seven free throws. Parker replaced Collins, the team's leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. The Hawks hit seven 3s in the fourth , but DeRozan blamed San Antonio's late defensive lapses for letting the game slip away. ""We were getting stops,"" DeRozan said. ""We were being aggressive. That was the main part. We made them miss a lot of shots, then they caught a rhythm in the fourth quarter after we lost that lead in the third quarter.""

"CHICAGO --  LeBron James and Anthony Davis watched and cheered as Kyle Kuzma powered a big fourth-quarter run for Los Angeles. Sure, James was his usual brilliant self. But Kuzma's performance was a big deal for the rolling Lakers. James had 30 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his third consecutive triple-double, and Los Angeles rallied to beat the Chicago Bulls 118-112 on Tuesday night for its sixth straight victory. Kuzma scored 11 of his 15 points in the final period during his third game after missing the start of the season with a right ankle injury. The 24-year-old guard got hurt while playing for USA Basketball this past summer. ""I'm getting there,"" Kuzma said. ""It's a process, I know. It's all about being patient right now because I haven't really had much basketball time since August."" Kuzma averaged 18.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game last season. The Lakers are hoping he can provide a viable third option alongside the leading duo of James and Davis. ""Kuz got into a rhythm, and that's what he's capable of,"" James said. Los Angeles trailed by 19 before outscoring Chicago 38-19 in the fourth during the finale of a three-game trip. Kuzma began the quarter with seven straight points, part of a 16-0 run that lifted the Lakers to a 96-93 lead with 8:12 left. James was on the bench for most of the big spurt, and Davis watched the entire run from the sideline. ""A.D. was in foul trouble. Bron was exhausted,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""Both of those guys needed to stay on the bench and other guys needed to step up, and they did."" Chicago lost for the fifth time in six games. Zach LaVine scored 26 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. had 11 points and 11 rebounds in his third straight double-double. Coby White and Otto Porter Jr. each scored 18 points. ""This one hurts,"" LaVine said. ""We were beating them up until the fourth quarter. We're showing we can play with these teams. We know we're talented. We've had 10-, 12-, 16-point leads on a lot of teams, but we're losing games. It's frustrating."" The Bulls used a 16-2 run to open a 60-42 lead with 2:49 left in the first half. Carter's two foul shots made it 63-44 with 2:10 to go. ""We've got to learn to finish,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""They finished and we didn't."" Kuzma got some help as the Lakers rallied in the fourth. Quinn Cook scored eight of his season-high 17 in the final period. Dwight Howard had a key block on White during the big run. James helped close it out after he checked in with 8:37 remaining. He found Davis for an alley-oop jam that made it 114-101 with 2:04 left. Davis finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in his first game in his native Chicago since he was acquired in a trade with New Orleans. TRIPLE THE FUN James became the first player to post three consecutive triple-doubles for the Lakers since Magic Johnson had four in a row in 1987. ""It comes with team success for me,"" James said. ""A triple-double means absolutely nothing to me if it's not in a win."" OLD FRIENDS Boylen worked for Vogel for two seasons with the Indiana Pacers. Vogel called Boylen ""one of the smartest basketball men I've ever worked with,"" and Boylen also heaped praise on his former boss. ""Frank's a worker.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  After blowing a five-point lead against Portland a week ago, the Oklahoma City Thunder turned up the focus on defense late in games. It worked against New Orleans on Sunday, and the Thunder did it again Tuesday night, riding 24 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to a 102-94 victory over the Orlando Magic. ""I thought we executed very well and then we defended really, really well coming down the stretch,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""I've seen significant growth and improvement from the guys."" Chris Paul added 20 points -- eight in the final 2:09 -- along with six assists for the Thunder (3-4), who held their opponent under 100 points for the fourth time in seven games. Steven Adams had 11 points and 11 rebounds. ""We're sort of figuring it out, finding some sets that we like to go to,"" Paul said. Aaron Gordon had 15 points and eight rebounds to lead the Magic (2-5), who scored just 15 points in the fourth quarter and have yet to reach 100 in a game this season. Orlando had six players reach double figures in points, including Jonathan Isaac, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. Nikola Vucevic had 10 points and 11 rebounds. ""I thought we did a lot of good things,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We were right there. We've got to find ways to score in the fourth quarter. We've got to be able to step up and make some of those, we had a couple of wide-open ones there. It's the difference between winning and losing."" Oklahoma City led 58-53 at halftime and managed to hold onto the lead until Al-Farouq Aminu's two free throws tied it at 81 early in the fourth quarter. The Magic tied it at 83 a couple of minutes later but never regained the advantage. They pulled within 88-87 on Gordon's long jump shot with 4:44 remaining, but Oklahoma City used a 9-2 run over the three-plus minutes to regain control. Both teams shot poorly in the fourth quarter, with the Thunder at 33.3 percent (7 of 21) and Orlando at 26.3 (5 of 19). ""We've got to make shots, we are shooting a terrible percentage as a team,"" said Gordon, whose team shot 39 percent (32 of 82) on the night. ""I think we are doing an OK job on defense, but you aren't going to win the game without offense."" TIP-INS Orlando: Evan Fournier entered tied for the team lead with 16.8 points per game but managed just four, all free throws, while shooting 0 of 7. It was his first game this season in single digits. ... The Magic held the edge in rebounds, 53-38, with 16 offensive boards, including 11 in the first half. ... Orlando held a significant advantage in bench points, outscoring the Thunder's reserves 39-26. Oklahoma City: Denis Schroder averaged 19.5 points over his previous four outings but scored just five in this one, shooting 2 of 11 from the floor. ... The Thunder hold a 10-2 record against Orlando at home, winning four in a row. TRIBUTE Before the game, the Thunder paid tribute to the victims of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, inviting family members of the 168 people killed in the attack onto the court for a short observance prior to the national anthem, while holding up customized Thunder jerseys with the number 95 on it, along with the last name of their loved one.","401160743"
"DENVER --  Will Barton put his best foot forward in a return from a toe injury. Barton had 15 points and 10 rebounds while leading Denver's resurgent transition game and the Nuggets pulled away in the second half to beat the Miami Heat 109-89 Tuesday night. ""I think Will, when he's locked in and focused like he's playing right now, he gives you a lot of positives on both ends of the floor,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Jamal Murray had 21 points and Jerami Grant also had 15 for the Nuggets, the first team this season to hold Miami under 100 points. Jimmy Butler had 16 points on 3-of-12 shooting while being guarded mostly by Barton. Kelly Olynyk added 13 points for Miami, which was outshot from the floor by the Nuggets 52.3 percent to 36.4 percent. ""I was in a good place before this injury and I feel like I'm pretty much back there,"" said Barton, who missed the previous two games. ""I was a little rusty tonight, a little winded. I had a couple of unnecessary turnovers."" When he was in, he was spearheading the Nuggets defense, hitting the boards and helping to lead the team's fast break. ""That's when I'm at my best, when I'm getting defensive rebounds and then going down and finishing and putting pressure on the defense,"" he said. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the Nuggets seemed to be a step ahead of the Heat throughout much of the game. ""They were the aggressors,"" he said. ""We weren't able to impose our will for any long stretches of the game defensively and you could see that early on with allowing 30 points in the paint. They played well and it wasn't really a competitive game in the second half."" Up by 10 at halftime, the Nuggets doubled their lead with a strong third quarter in which they outscored the Heat 31-20 despite losing Paul Millsap to a facial laceration early in the period after Gary Harris left near the end of the second quarter with an ankle injury. Monte Morris converted a three-point play in the final moments of the third, helping the Nuggets take an 89-68 lead into the fourth. Morris finished with 11 points. Denver scored eight of the next nine points starting the final quarter, capped by Torrey Craig's dunk off a lob pass from Nikola Jokic to move in front 97-70 with 8:58 left to play. Bam Adebayo's driving layup broke the Nuggets' surge but not enough to alter the outcome for the Heat, who had trailed by a point after the first quarter. Denver substituted freely in the final minutes. The Nuggets closed the last 5:04 of the second quarter on a 16-5 run to take a 58-48 lead at halftime. Barton began the flurry by converting a go-ahead three-point play and also connected on a 3-pointer during the surge. BACK IN THE GROOVE Monte Morris left his slow start to the season behind with a sparkling 11-point, eight-assist effort off the bench. ""I call it just a mini-slump, but it really wasn't a slump for me, honestly,"" he said. ""The same shots I was missing, I'm making now. I just feel like I'm more engaged on both ends and trying to make an impact whenever I'm out there."" TIP-INS Heat: F KZ Okpala was sidelined by a left Achilles tendon strain. ... F/G Derrick Jones Jr. is back from a left groin strain that sidelined him the previous four games. ... F/G Justise Winslow returned to action after missing two games with lower back stiffness. Nuggets: Barton returned to the starting lineup after missing the past two games with a swollen left toe. ... Harris left the game late in the second quarter with a left ankle sprain and was ruled out for the remainder of the contest. ... Millsap suffered a cut on his forehead when he collided during a third-quarter fast break with Meyers Leonard, who was called for a flagrant 1 foul. Team trainers stopped the bleeding with a headband bandage and Millsap made both free throws before being replaced on the floor by Grant.","401160744"
"DETROIT --  Tony Snell connected from beyond the arc to open the scoring in the first few seconds of the game. Little did anyone realize he was on his way to a memorable night. Snell scored 24 points on 9-of-9 shooting, and the short-handed Detroit Pistons had little trouble with New York, beating the Knicks 122-102 on Wednesday. Snell made six 3-pointers, becoming the first player in franchise history to shoot 100 percent from the field with at least six 3s. He was only the ninth player in NBA history to do it. ""They just depend on me to go out there and do what I do best, and shoot the ball. The best way to do it is to have ball movement,"" Snell said. ""They're very confident in me. I'm confident as well."" Andre Drummond had 27 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists, and Markieff Morris added 22 points for Detroit. The Pistons played without their injured trio of Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose and Reggie Jackson. Detroit still shot 56 percent from the field and dropped the Knicks to an NBA-worst 1-7. New York's Mitchell Robinson left the game with concussion-like symptoms. The Pistons have won eight straight meetings with New York. Detroit led 64-59 at halftime. It was 74-72 when Morris made a 3-pointer while being fouled. It was ruled a flagrant foul on Julius Randle, and after Morris made the free throw for a four-point play, Drummond added a layup immediately after. ""It's tough to weather a six-point play,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""It's actually the first game I've seen it since I've been coaching."" That sequence started a 10-0 run that pushed the lead into double digits. Langston Galloway also had a four-point play for the Pistons in the fourth quarter. Randle led the Knicks with 20 points, and Marcus Morris contributed 18. SHARING THE BALL The Pistons had a season-high 37 assists, even though they were playing without some of their most experienced playmakers. Drummond finished one assist short of a career high. Luke Kennard had 12 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Galloway and Bruce Brown had six assists apiece. ""The ball was moving, they found the open person. It didn't stick,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""Guys didn't drive in the paint and take midrange shots. I thought we did a better job with our shot spectrum tonight, and that's where the rhythm of the shots came."" PERIMETER DEFENSE Snell wasn't the only player making outside shots for Detroit. Morris made four 3-pointers, and the Pistons were 15 for 30 from long range as a team. ""These are the best players in the world. They hit shots,"" Knicks guard RJ Barrett said. ""I think Tony Snell didn't miss a shot today. But it happens. That's basketball. Life happens and we've just got to move to the next one."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York was without Dennis Smith (personal reasons), Kadeem Allen (right foot strain), Elfrid Payton (right hamstring strain) and Reggie Bullock (cervical disk herniation). Pistons: Griffin hasn't played this season because of hamstring and knee issues. Jackson, who has had back problems, has only appeared in two games. Rose missed a third straight game with a right hamstring strain. Detroit was also without Tim Frazier, who has a right shoulder strain.","401160745"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Nate McMillan wanted to see adjustments and quick, and the Indiana Pacers head coach saw what he looking for in a 121-106 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. ""We showed them tape (from Tuesday night's loss) of our shot selection, shooting the floaters, not taking the extra dribble, getting to the rim and drawing contact,"" he said. ""Tonight I think we did a much better job of not settling for floaters and the ball movement was great."" T.J. Warren scored 21 points to lead the Pacers (4-4), who were playing their third game in four nights. Doug McDermott came off the bench and scored 17 of his 19 points in the first half. ""I can shoot it anywhere,"" McDermott said. ""I'm excited to just make some shots. It's always good."" Aaron Holiday finished with 18 points. Domantas Sabonis, who missed the last two games with a left calf contusion, had 13 points and tied his career high with 17 rebounds before fouling out with 3:20 left to play. Bradley Beal had 30 points, five rebounds and five assists to lead the Wizards (2-5), who have lost four of five games. Thomas Bryant had 20 points and 11 rebounds and C.J. Miles added 15 points. JaKarr Sampson scored 14 points in a 22-2 run in the third quarter to help Indiana build a 23-point lead. Sabonis' two free throws with 5:22 remaining in the third put the Pacers ahead 92-67. The Wizards closed out the third quarter scoring 11 straight points, capped off with Beal's jumper just before the buzzer to make it 94-80. ""There was a point where we couldn't get stops,"" Beal said. ""The whole second quarter and part of the third quarter hurt, too. We've got to defend better than what we did tonight."" The Pacers led by 13 in the first half with Malcolm Brogdon's free throw for a technical called on Wizards coach Scott Brooks with 1:21 remaining in the second quarter. Bryant converted a 3-point play at the end of a 6-2 run to close out the second, and the Pacers led 70-62 at halftime. TOP SCORE Indiana's 121 points was the most points scored in a game this season by the team. The Pacers also recorded a season-high for points scored in a quarter with 44 in the second period, and most points in a half with 70 points by halftime. BEAL VS. INDY Beal scored more than 25 points in three of the four meetings between the Wizards and the Pacers last season. And he quietly did it again this time, too. He had 21 points by halftime and then scored four points in the third quarter and five in the fourth quarter.

"ATLANTA --  For the second night in a row, the Chicago Bulls took a big lead into the fourth quarter. This time, they didn't let up. Tomas Satoransky scored a career-high 27 points and the Bulls won for just the third time in nine games with easily their most impressive performance of the young season, routing the Atlanta Hawks 113-93 on Wednesday. ""We were all frustrated by the way the last game went,"" said Satoransky, who went 10 of 13 from the field, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. The Bulls built a big lead against LeBron James and the Lakers the night before, only to get outscored 38-19 in the fourth quarter of a 118-112 loss. Taking out their frustration on the Hawks, this one was total domination. Satoransky had not scored more than nine points this season. He really went off on the Hawks, beating his previous career best of 25 while also dishing out eight assists. Zach LaVine even got a chance to put on his version of Showtime, blocking De'Andre Hunter's 3-pointer to set up a 360-degree dunk at the other end. ""We put it together tonight,"" Coby White said. ""Both halves."" Atlanta made a season-low six of 30 attempts from 3-point range, turned it over 24 times and trailed by double digits over the final 41:29. ""Our guys were not ready,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said bluntly. ""We just didn't care."" The Bulls took control with a 28-6 run in the opening quarter. Otto Porter Jr. led with way with 10 points, including a couple of 3-pointers. Satoransky chipped in with seven points, Kris Dunn added five and Lauri Markkanen knocked down a 3 to push Chicago to a 30-12 lead. Porter went down before halftime with a bruised left foot and did not return. He wasn't needed. The Bulls were up 56-41 at the break, closing the half with a couple of quick passes around the perimeter to set up Satoransky's 3 from the corner as the buzzer sounded. It was the lowest-scoring first half of the season for the Hawks. Chicago stretched the margin as high as 28 points. ""We played 40 really good minutes last night and that's not enough,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""They were hurting from the way the game ended last night."" Starting his second straight game in place of John Collins, Jabari Parker led the Hawks with 18 points. Collins is serving a 25-game suspension after violating the NBA's doping policy. But Pierce wasn't in the mood to praise anyone. ""The only positive from this game: It's over,"" the Atlanta coach said. ""We don't have to worry about it anymore."" YOUNG STRUGGLES It was a miserable night for Atlanta's Trae Young, on the heels of a dazzling 29-point, 13-assist performance in a victory over San Antonio the previous night. The point guard managed just nine points and three assists, missing all eight attempts beyond the arc. ""Coming off a big win, you've got to be mentally focused. You've got to approach every game like it's your last,"" Young said. ""We didn't do that."" Pierce said the Bulls were determined to stop Young after he scored 49 points against them in a game last season. ""They're not going to forget that,"" Pierce said. ""That's the way they're going to play Trae every game the rest of his career."" TIP-INS Bulls: Connected on 13 of 33 from 3-point range. ... Markkanen added 17 points, Porter finished with 13 in just 11 minutes, and three other players reached double figures. ... Boylen said he won't have an update on Porter's condition until the team gets back to Chicago. Hawks: Vince Carter, 42, had a season-high 14 points. ... Kevin Huerter, with 12, was the only other Atlanta player in double figures. ... Young wasn't the only player who struggled.

""You've got to beat people with your readiness.""","401160747"
"TORONTO --  Pascal Siakam and the Toronto Raptors are confident they can play better. Sacramento Kings coach Luke Walton, meanwhile, found reason to be happy with his team despite another loss. Siakam had 23 points and 13 rebounds, Kyle Lowry scored 24 and the Raptors held on to beat the Kings 124-120 Wednesday night. ""We didn't win like we wanted to,"" Siakam said, ""but we got the win and that's all that matters."" Toronto built a 36-23 advantage after the first quarter, but the Kings outscored the Raptors in each of the final three periods and cut a 15-point deficit to three in the fourth. ""They were hard to get rid of,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. Serge Ibaka scored 10 of his 21 points in the fourth and OG Anunoby finished with a season-high 18 as the Raptors won their fifth straight over the Kings and improved to 4-0 at home this season. ""We have to continue to get better and grow as a team,"" Lowry said. ""We take the win, figure it out and get better."" Lowry has scored 20 or more six times in Toronto's first seven games. The reigning NBA champions were 12-3 last season when Lowry had at least 20 points. ""He's doing it all,"" teammate Fred VanVleet said. ""Whatever we need on a nightly basis, he's been giving it."" Lowry led the Raptors with six assists and was one of three Toronto players with two steals. ""He does everything that you want a leader to do,"" Kings guard De'Aaron Fox said. VanVleet and Marc Gasol each scored 12 for Toronto. Gasol's total was a season high. Harrison Barnes had a season-high 26 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 13 of his 22 in the fourth quarter and Buddy Hield added 21 as the Kings had their modest two-game winning streak snapped. Sacramento had beaten Utah and New York after five straight defeats to begin the season. ""I'm happy for the direction we're moving,"" Walton said. ""It's a tough place to play, it's the NBA champs, and they were making a lot of shots tonight."" Fox had 17 points and nine assists for the Kings, and Cory Joseph scored 10 against his former team. Hield missed a jump shot that would have made it a two-point game with 35 seconds left in the final period and the Raptors ahead 122-118. Ibaka grabbed the rebound, and VanVleet capped it with a pair of free throws. ""I feel like we threw punches and we landed a few,"" Fox said. ""We would bring it to within four and then they would execute, execute. That's what a championship-level team does."" The Kings matched a franchise record by making 20 3-pointers. Sacramento took 43 shots from behind the arc. Toronto missed four straight shots to start the game, then connected on 14 in a row through the remainder of the first quarter. Lowry's driving layup with 1.4 seconds left gave the Raptors a 13-point edge after one. ""That first quarter, we shot ourselves in the foot,"" Fox said. Walton shared those sentiments. ""We can't give up 36 points on the road in the first quarter against the champs,"" Walton said. ""Now we're playing catch up the rest of the night."" TIP-INS Kings: Trailed at halftime for the second time this season. Sacramento also was behind at the half in an Oct. 26 loss at Utah. ... First-year assistant coach Roy Rana began his career in Toronto, first as a high school coach and later as head coach at Ryerson University, where his team lost consecutive Canadian national championship games in 2017 and 2018. ...

"HOUSTON --  Despite an entirely different lineup of Golden State Warriors, James Harden was still out for blood Wednesday night. Harden had 36 points and 13 assists and the Houston Rockets routed Golden State 129-112, sending the short-handed Warriors to their sixth loss in eight games this season. Less than six months ago, a vastly different roster of Warriors ended another Houston playoff run for the third time in four seasons. ""That's a part of the league,"" Harden said about the changing faces. ""It's a part of the NBA. There's been a lot of different faces since I've been here. It was bound to happen at some point and it is what it is."" Harden again appeared to be moving past his early shooting woes, going 6 of 16 from 3-point range. Since going 17 of 79 on 3s in his first six games, Harden has made 13 of 32 the last two. Harden's 292 points through the first eight games (36.5 points per game) mark the highest point total through eight games since Michael Jordan had 303 in 1988-89. Russell Westbrook had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. P.J. Tucker had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Clint Capela added 19 points and 16 rebounds, and Austin Rivers was 4 for 4 from 3 with 12 points. Alec Burks led Golden State with 28 points. Eric Paschall had 19 points, and Glenn Robinson III added 15 points and 11 rebounds. The rookie Paschall was challenged with guarding Harden for much of the game. ""It's just hard because he's so dynamic and he's a great passer,"" Paschall said. ""And during his (isolation plays), you can't really touch him because he's so smart on how he draws the fouls. As a team, we did a good job in the first half, but then he got hot and started hitting 3s."" Already reeling from injuries to Splash Brothers Stephen Curry (broken hand) and Klay Thompson (knee surgery) and the loss of Kevin Durant, the Warriors were without D'Angelo Russell (sprained right ankle) and Draymond Green (torn ligament in left index finger) for a third straight game. Russell, who sat on the Golden State bench, could return Friday, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Golden State fell to 2-6 for the first time in eight years. Both teams struggled with their shooting for spurts of the first half, but late in the second quarter, Harden drilled a deep 3-pointer where he was also fouled. That shot fired up both Harden and the Toyota Center crowd, including rapper Travis Scott, who was sitting courtside. Houston led 63-52 at the half, thanks in large part to Harden's 24 first-half points, but also Golden State's 38.8% shooting from the field. There were seven lead changes in the first half before Houston started to pull away. To open up the second half, the Rockets held the Warriors to just three field goals in the first seven minutes of the third quarter and built a lead as large as 23 points. They entered the fourth quarter leading 98-83. ""I didn't like our shot selection as a team tonight,"" Kerr said. ""I didn't think we played for each other. I thought we were driving to try to score instead of driving to try to score instead of driving to try to move the ball to someone on the team who can make the next play."" TIP-INS Warriors: C Kevon Looney will likely miss at least the next two weeks with a nerve condition that has kept him out the last six games, the Warriors said. Looney missed the entire preseason with a strained right hamstring and exited the second half of the season opener with tightness in the hamstring. Rockets: SG Eric Gordon missed Wednesday night's game with a sore hamstring injury he suffered in Monday night's win in Memphis. Gordon is likely day-to-day, and coach Mike D'Antoni said he's hopeful Gordon can return Saturday night when the Rockets visit Chicago. SAME BUILDING, NEW FACES ""It is strange. We were in this building not too long ago with a huge game. We're entirely different. I don't think we have a single player from that night that's going to play tonight. Houston is different, too, with the trade with Chris (Paul) for Russell (Westbrook). Everything's very different. It's early in the season, and everybody is trying to figure out what's what."" -- Warriors coach Steve Kerr on playing at the Toyota Center less than six months removed from a series-winning Game 6 victory in the Western Conference semifinals. SHAPING UP D'Antoni said some of Houston's early struggles have been related to issues with conditioning. He took part of the blame for saving his players' legs in the preseason and limiting practices but said he believes the shooting, the energy and the defense will improve once the conditioning comes around. Harden said the conditioning is a work in progress. ""We're getting there game by game. We don't really practice a lot, we're a vet team. (D'Antoni) leaves it up to us to go out there and compete at a high level. We work on our condition in that way. Individually, we have to make sure we're on that, and as a team, we have to make sure we're on that."" HOT HOUSE Rockets SF Danuel House Jr. had a season-high 17 points while shooting 5 of 6 from 3-point range. House has scored 15 or more points in four of the past five games. The Rockets are 12-3 when House scores 15 or more points.","401160749"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies finally held onto a fourth-quarter lead thanks to the play of their starting guards. Dillon Brooks scored 31 points, rookie Ja Morant added 26 and the Grizzlies beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 137-121 on Wednesday night. The fourth-quarter play of the two guards sealed the game with Brooks scoring 16 points in the period and Morant adding 14, The pair combined to shoot 11 of 17 in the quarter. ""It was a good way to end the game,"" Brooks said. ""We put it in Ja's hands and he knew how to finish the game."" But it was Brooks who put the game away, scoring all 10 Memphis points in a 10-2 burst near the midway point of the fourth. Rookie Brandon Clarke made all seven of his shots and scored 18 points, while Jae Crowder also had 18 points for Memphis. The Grizzlies snapped a three-game losing streak. The game featured two of the league's fastest teams in pace, leading to rapid changing ends of the court. The Grizzlies were able to record 26 fast-break points compared to 13 for Minnesota. Memphis would end the night shooting a season-best 57%, including connecting on 12 of 23 3-pointers. The 137 points was the second-highest scoring game in franchise history -- quite the change from the grit and grind era where Memphis was annually among the slowest-pace teams in the league. ""It was mostly the transition defense, but our halfcourt defense wasn't that good either,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 30 points. Karl-Anthony Towns returned from a two-game suspension for a confrontation with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid to finish with 25 points and 13 rebounds. ""It came down to getting stops,"" Wiggins said. ""We couldn't get any stops. They had some guys who kept making plays."" For Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins, the victory -- the Grizzlies' second of a season -- is an example of the continued work needed for his young team to improve. And he is noticing strides in the right direction. ""You've got to be able to do this night-in and night-out,"" Jenkins said. ""Minnesota still scored a bunch of points.

"DALLAS --  Twice in the final minute with a one-point lead, the Dallas Mavericks committed a turnover, including the last of their 17 miscues on a bad pass from young triple-double phenom Luka Doncic with 10 seconds left. And twice in the final minute, the Mavericks drew a charge on Aaron Gordon, only to give the Orlando Magic one more chance to win when Seth Curry missed two free throws. Nikola Vucevic missed an open 3-pointer just before the buzzer after the two calls against Gordon and Curry's misfires, Doncic scored 27 points and the Mavericks held on for a 107-106 victory Wednesday night. ""They saved me,"" Doncic said of the Dallas D after finishing with seven rebounds and seven assists while chasing a third straight triple-double for the first time in the reigning rookie of the year's career. ""I didn't do the right play on the offense. They saved me on the defense."" The first call against Gordon came with 34 seconds to go on a drive in the lane against Dorian Finney-Smith, who used to be the primary defensive specialist for the Mavericks before they added Delon Wright in the offseason. Just three seconds after Doncic's turnover, Gordon got his sixth foul for pushing off against Tim Hardaway Jr. at the 3-point line. The Magic finally executed what they wanted on offense after Curry's misses, but Vucevic's shot from just right of the key bounced off the rim. ""It's two plays down the stretch,"" said Gordon, who led Orlando with 23 points but scored just two after halftime as the Magic dropped their fourth straight game in the 10th consecutive loss for the road team in this series. ""One, I like the way I was being aggressive. The other one, I could have made a better decision. We still got a good shot at the end. It's what we wanted but executing down the stretch there's a couple of things we could have done better for sure."" Vucevic had 19 points and 11 rebounds, while Jonathan Isaac finished with 13 points and 10 boards. J.J. Barea, a 13-year veteran with a history of bringing energy off the bench for the Mavericks, made his season debut in the second quarter and had 11 straight Dallas points -- all of his scoring -- while Doncic and fellow Euro star Kristaps Porzingis were struggling. Three consecutive 3-pointers from Barea helped Dallas get within two at halftime (56-54) after trailing by 10 in the first half. He was considered healthy when the season started but didn't play the first six games after an Achilles injury limited him to 38 games last season. ""I was playing with my kids and my dog in my house, doing all type of stuff,"" Barea said. ""But I felt good out there. I think it's the longer I waited, the better it gets. So I'm not mad about it."" Porzingis scored 10 points on 4-of-14 shooting with eight rebounds. Maxi Kleber scored 14, and Dwight Powell added 12. Doncic was 1 of 7 from 3, with the only make in the fourth quarter. Porzingis was 1 of 5 from beyond the arc. TIP-INS Magic: Scored 100 points for the first time this season. ... Steve Clifford coached his 500th game. His record is 240-260. It's Clifford's second season in Orlando after five with Charlotte. ... Carter-Williams didn't attempt another 3 but finished with 13 points along with D.J. Augustin. ... Vucevic matched Doncic for the game high with seven assists. Mavericks: Doncic has scored at least 25 points in six of seven games this season. ... Justin Jackson scored a season-high 11 points, including a layup on a nifty bounce pass in transition from Hardaway to cap a 15-3 run in the third quarter. Dallas erased Orlando's biggest lead of the game (11 points) for a 75-74 lead. EFFICIENT HARDAWAY Hardaway capped a plus-15 showing with his play on Gordon in the final seconds. He scored 13 points. ""I saw him going full speed,"" Hardaway said of Gordon. ""I saw when he was dribbling, he had his left hand out. I just wanted to make sure I got into him enough to make him extend his arm. And once he extended the arm, they have to call that. That's one of the rules that they put in this year."" SHAKY START FROM 3 Orlando, second-to-last in the NBA at 27 percent from 3-point range coming in, missed all seven 3s in the first quarter, capped by Michael Carter-Williams' air ball while wide open in the corner in the final seconds of the first. Gordon was 9 of 11 from the field before halftime, including the only 3 before the break for the Magic, who finished 6 of 24 (25 percent) from long range.","401160751"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Rebounding became a primary focus for the Utah Jazz after they struggled on the boards in two straight losses. It turned into an area of strength against the Philadelphia 76ers. Donovan Mitchell had 24 points and eight assists as the Jazz beat Philadelphia 106-104 on Wednesday night thanks in large part to their effort on the glass. Utah had a 50-42 edge in rebounds over the Sixers, who were sixth in the NBA in rebounding through their first six games. ""We had great urgency on the boards,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Obviously, it was something that our guys internalized. We watched film. Those are boxes you're checking and our guys came to rebound."" Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points, 16 rebounds and three steals. Joe Ingles scored a season-high 16 off the bench for Utah. The Jazz improved to 4-0 at home this season after holding the 76ers to one field goal over the final four minutes. ""We've had great stretches of defense throughout the entire year,"" Mitchell said. ""We've defended really well and this was another night of it, but we've got to keep going."" Joel Embiid had 27 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Sixers, who have dropped two consecutive games after a 5-0 start that made them the last unbeaten team in the NBA. Josh Richardson added a season-high 24 points and Tobias Harris chipped in with 16. Ben Simmons did not play in the second half because of right shoulder soreness after bumping into Royce O'Neale's chest while posting up on a first-quarter play. Simmons finished with two points and two assists in 10 minutes. Not having their point guard on the floor altered what the Sixers were able to do in terms of containing Utah's top playmakers. ""Defense is where we felt the pain of not having him the most,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. The Sixers built a 44-36 early in the second quarter after Embiid scored on three straight possessions, capped by a step-back jumper. Utah chipped away at the deficit behind Bogdanovic, who scored 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting in the period. The Jazz finally went ahead 55-51 when Bogdanovic knocked down a pair of shots and fed Gobert for an alley-oop dunk over three straight possessions. Utah took control in the third behind hot shooting from Mitchell. He scored back-to-back baskets to spark a 12-2 run that gave the Jazz a 78-65 lead late in the quarter. Mitchell totaled four field goals and assisted on two others during the period. Embiid hit four free throws over consecutive possessions to help trim Utah's lead to 103-101 with 1:51 left. Bogdanovic drained a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession to keep Philadelphia from taking the lead. It ended up being the only 3 the Jazz made during the quarter. BACK IN ACTION Embiid returned after serving a two-game suspension for fighting with Minnesota center Karl-Anthony Towns and logged his third double-double of the season. Embiid also brought back a contrite attitude on how his actions and absence affected the Sixers. ""Getting suspended is not great for me, or for the team, so it's never going to happen again,"" he said. FREE THROW PARADE Philadelphia shot 30 of 34 from the free throw line. Embiid led the way, going 16 of 18. Utah was 16 for 24 at the line. Snyder acknowledged his team's aggressiveness on the boards resulted in the fouls piling up. ""They're talented offensive players,"" he said. ""They put you in difficult positions where you can foul and it's hard not to. I wish we could have been a little better keeping them off the line."" FINDING A GROOVE Mike Conley's early shooting struggles are fading away. Conley is shooting 43.6% from the floor over his last four games after finishing with 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting against the Sixers. It's a big step forward after he hit just 20% from the field over his first four games with the Jazz. ""I thought I had a good flow throughout the whole game, just knowing when my time was to be aggressive and when I was to be a decoy or cutting or whatever it was,"" Conley said. ""I'm just trying to figure out where my timing is and I think tonight was a good step."" TIP-INS 76ers: Richardson had his first 20-point game of the season. ... Brown was whistled for a technical foul in the third quarter. ... Raul Neto spent his first four NBA seasons with the Jazz. Neto finished with 11 points and a team-high four assists during his first game back in Utah after signing with the Sixers over the summer. Jazz: Mitchell made his first four shots and scored 10 points in the opening quarter. ... Gobert was whistled for a flagrant 1 foul in the third after swinging his arm out and hitting Richardson in the face. ...

"Before the Bucks-Clippers game, Paul George is seen draining 3-pointers. (0:17) LOS ANGELES --  The numbers are adding up quickly for Giannis Antetokounmpo. The reigning NBA MVP had 38 points and 16 rebounds to help the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 129-124 on Wednesday night for their fourth victory in a row. It's what he's done to start the season that really stands out. Antetokounmpo became the first player in league history with 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in the first eight games of a season. ""He played the whole fourth quarter and was fabulous,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Antetokounmpo had 13 points in 12 minutes during the fourth as Milwaukee repelled several threats by the Clippers, who kept getting within four only to come up short. ""Guys were physical with me but at the end of the day you've just got to keep doing what you're doing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I was trying to make plays, try to stay aggressive. That's what my teammates wanted me to do."" Antetokounmpo just missed a triple-double with nine assists. He's posted at least 10 rebounds and five assists in each of the first eight games this season, the first player to do that since at least 1972-73. ""He's a beast,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. George Hill scored 24 points off the bench and hit six of the Bucks' 18 3-pointers. The Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard, who rested for the first half of a home back-to-back. He'll play against Portland on Thursday night. ""When he sits out we've just got to step up,"" said Lou Williams, who had 34 points and 11 assists. Montrezl Harrell had a career-high 34 points and 13 rebounds in his first start of the season. ""It don't mean nothing,"" he said in a low voice. ""We lost."" Patrick Beverley added 20 points and 10 rebounds in the Clippers' first home defeat. Led by Hill and Kyle Korver with 14 points, the Bucks' reserves outscored the Clippers' bench 47-20, the first time that's happened to Los Angeles this season. Harrell and Williams being in the starting lineup reduced much of the bench production. Los Angeles starter Landry Shamet had just two points coming into the fourth, but made four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points. The last one put the Clippers within two with 23 seconds left. ""If we came up with one or two more stops, the game might have been different,"" Harrell said. The Bucks finished it off at the free throw line, and the Clippers couldn't connect on multiple chances during their last possession. ""They had us on our heels the whole game,"" Williams said. ""We just weren't as sharp as we'd like to be."" The Clippers closed within four early in the fourth, but Antetokounmpo reeled off seven straight points to keep the Bucks ahead 115-103. ""I just know he's always around the rim,"" former Clippers guard Eric Bledsoe said of Antetokounmpo. ""Even though it's a bad play or whatnot, he's going to be under the rim, so I just find a way to get it to him."" Bledsoe added 20 points, and Brook Lopez had 11 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks. The Clippers erased an 11-point deficit in the third. They forced three ties, but each time Antetokounmpo answered for the Bucks. He dunked, hit a 3-pointer and made two free throws. Milwaukee outscored the Clippers 15-6 to take a 98-89 lead into the fourth. The Bucks opened the second on a 30-11 run, hitting five 3-pointers, for their largest lead of 17 points. Hill scored 14 to help the Bucks lead 70-59 at halftime. They closed with three consecutive 3s, two by Hill and the last by Korver, who beat the buzzer. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo had two airballs: the first on a jumper to end the first quarter and the second on a free throw in the third. ... For the first time in three games, the Bucks didn't lead all the way -- but they came close. The Clippers' only lead was by three points. Clippers: Starting F Patrick Patterson had just two points. ... Rivers remained stuck on 899 career wins. FROM LONG RANGE The Bucks took 49 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo tied his career high with four, the same number Bledsoe and Korver made. ""It makes a big difference,"" Budenholzer said. ""We hopefully can open up the court and it gives different guys driving lanes. We want to keep shooting them."" OUCH! Budenholzer said Hill got popped in the eye but is expected to be fine.","401160753"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  As he peered up at the videoboard suspended above the court, Kemba Walker broke into a wide smile and tears trickled down his cheeks. The Hornets honored their all-time leading scorer with a highlight video Thursday night, giving the Boston Celtics point guard a hero's welcome in his return to Charlotte. As the tribute ended, the crowd erupted with a loud, one-minute standing ovation. ""It was special,"" Walker said. ""Just to be back here and the amount of love I have been getting today and leading up to this day. The video just topped it off. It made me really emotional. I was trying to hold it in, but I couldn't. I knew I wasn't going to be able to."" Jayson Tatum scored 23 points, and Walker got what he ultimately wanted -- a victory -- in his homecoming game as the Celtics soundly defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 108-87. It was an underwhelming performance by Walker's standards. The three-time All-Star who once scored 60 points on this court was held to 14 on 4-of-12 shooting, and didn't make his first field goal until three minutes into the third quarter. Walker said the video didn't impact his play on the court, but coach Brad Stevens believed it contributed. ""Yeah, it's really hard,"" Stevens said. ""He had the right idea coming into the game but you knew right after they played that video, that probably was going to be a tough start. That was really cool and a great tribute by the Hornets. I know how much he appreciated it."" Walked played eight seasons in Charlotte before signing with the Celtics after Hornets owner Michael Jordan elected not to give Walker a five-year, $221 million supermax contract. But he left on good terms with the organization and its fans. After the game, Walker stayed on the court hugging members of the organization, including some of the ushers. ""It's always great to see Kemba,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""I love that guy. He has a great spirit. He's a great competitor and a wonderful person. I think it was a good night for him and for all of us. Both teams have moved on, but it's always good to see him."" Gordon Hayward added 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who scored 17 points off 21 Charlotte turnovers. Miles Bridges had 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Hornets, who had their three-game win streak snapped. Charlotte was just 6 of 31 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said center Enes Kanter is improving from a bruised left knee, but isn't quite ready to return. Hornets: Bridges received a technical after mixing it up with Marcus Smart in the fourth quarter. ... The Hornets had nine blocks. SMART MOVE Smart was upset after picking up his fifth foul and clapped in disgust in the direction of the Celtics bench after a couple of coaches appeared to be yelling at him on the court. Stevens said Smart's actions didn't bother him at all. ""This is the part about Marcus that I love -- his fire, his competitiveness,"" Stevens said. ""If there's a moment when he's upset with us, that's all part of it, we move on pretty quickly. We've been together a long time and I've been yelled at before and that's OK. I love him and I trust him and he'll get every opportunity."" ROZIER STRUGGLES Terry Rozier, signed by the Hornets to replace Walker, was hoping for a big game against his former team but struggled all night and was held to three points after shooting 1 of 11 from the field. ""He tried to play the right way but shots weren't falling,"" Borrego said. ""He competed tonight and he just has to stick with it. It's an emotional game. It's always an interesting game. I think Kemba felt the same way in the first half. I think Kemba was 0 for 6 in the first half and I think Terry was 0 for 6."" WILLIAMS' RETURN Celtics rookie Grant Williams grew up about six minutes from the Spectrum Center -- and reminded his teammates of that on the way into Charlotte. ""When we were on the bus I was annoying because I was calling out interstates and talking about buildings like I'm a tour guide and everyone was telling me to shut up because it was 1 a.m.,"" Williams said with a laugh.","401160754"
"SAN ANTONIO -- Dejounte Murray had been making himself miserable in the film room. Watching turnover after turnover, he promised Spurs teammate LaMarcus Aldridge things were going to change against Oklahoma City on Thursday night. Aldridge was the benefactor of Murray's improved play at point guard, scoring a season-high 39 points to help San Antonio roll over the Thunder 121-112. ""I tell him every day, you're too great of a player to just go missing in action,"" Murray said. ""It's on me being a point guard and the rest of the team. We've got to make sure a guy like that is well involved early from the jump."" Murray had a career-high 10 assists along with 17 points and 8 rebounds. The 22-year-old played 26 minutes as San Antonio continues to restrict his play after he missed last season following right knee surgery. Murray, who was averaging 3.0 turnovers per game, had seven turnovers in back-to-back losses entering Thursday's game. ""I've got to stop being sloppy,"" Murray said. The Spurs had a season-high 32 assists in snapping their two-game skid. DeMar DeRozan added 16 points and nine assists for the Spurs. Danilo Gallinari scored 27 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 21 for the Thunder, who entered the game on a two-game winning streak. ""We were hanging around there, we just couldn't get enough stops,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. Aldridge finished 19-for-23 from the field and made 10 consecutive shots bridging the first and second halves. ""LaMarcus was a beast, his rhythm was really good,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He shot quickly, he made quick decisions and he also passed it out of there when he got doubled or there was a crowd. He did a great job of finding other people. He played a really smart game offensively."" Aldridge had a combined 22 points and shot 8-for-23 during the Spurs' two-game skid but made a 21-foot jumper against the Thunder to open the game. ""I definitely put the work in,"" Aldridge said. ""Just waiting for my shot to come back. The first one felt good, after that I just tried to stay with it."" Chris Paul had 19 points and five assists in 31 minutes. TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City's most recent win in San Antonio was Dec. 25, 2014. Russell Westbrook had 34 points and 11 assists in the 114-106 victory. ... Mike Muscala played one minute.

San Antonio set a season high with 33 points in the opening quarter. BIG THREE TO BIG BRO Spurs assistant coach Tim Duncan is mentoring Murray just as he once did for another Spurs point guard, Tony Parker. ""That's a big bro for me for sure,"" Murray said. ""As far as right now, he's coach, Coach Tim. Man, the knowledge he has, just everything around. He's always there trying to help me in everything, whether it's in the gym or [watching] film.

"PHOENIX --  Goran Dragic was an All-Star just two seasons ago. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra hasn't forgotten. The 12-year veteran might come off the bench for the Heat these days, but he's still capable of putting up big numbers and making big baskets. That was on full display Thursday night, when Dragic scored 20 of his 25 points in the second half to push the Miami Heat past the Phoenix Suns 124-108. ""It's a great luxury for us to bring an All-Star talent, in his prime still, off the bench,"" Spoelstra said. ""I don't take for that granted. And I'm going to make sure the team doesn't take that for granted."" Jimmy Butler scored 34 points and Dragic had the big second half to help Miami win for the fourth time in five games and bounce back from a 20-point loss to Denver on Tuesday. The Heat improved to 6-2 for the first time since 2012 when they had LeBron James and eventually won the NBA title. Butler had 18 points by the end of the first quarter and 30 at halftime as the Heat built a 64-57 lead. Miami shot 53.5 percent in the first half, hitting 7 of 14 from 3-point range. ""That guy's special,"" Spoelstra said. ""He really is. He set the tone for the game obviously in that first half. We just played off of his offensive force. Really smart basketball, getting to the rim, getting his open looks."" Dragic, who played six seasons early in his career with the Suns, hit a 3-pointer just before the buzzer at the end of the third quarter to put the Heat up 93-86. ""If you ask any player, when you play against your former team, it's extra motivation,"" Dragic said. ""It's always nice to win here."" Phoenix had its three-game winning streak snapped. Aron Baynes led the Suns with 23 points and Devin Booker added 22. Ricky Rubio had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Coach Monty Williams said his team's ball movement wasn't very good. ""We just didn't have it tonight and that happens,"" Williams said. ""I think it will be a great learning lesson for us."" HERRO BALL Miami rookie Tyler Herro had another solid game with 15 points on 6 of 12 shooting, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Spoelstra said Herro had some defensive breakdowns, but he's always competitive on the court. The coach said Herro wanted to guard Booker during the second half and the results were mixed. ""You gotta like the kid's guts, for better or worse,"" Spoelstra said. TOUGH SCHEDULE Miami has a tough turnaround with a road game against LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers in less than 24 hours on Friday night. ""No excuses,"" Dragic said. ""We'll go there and play hard and try to get a win. It's always fun to play against the best teams in the league. That's why we're here."" THE HOMESTAND CONTINUES Phoenix is now 1-1 on its six-game homestand. The Suns will face the Nets on Sunday and then have games against the Lakers, Hawks and Celtics. The Suns trailed for almost the entire game against the Heat. They fought within two points at multiple points late in the third quarter, but Dragic's big shooting night ended any hope for a win. ""We just have to bring it every night,"" Booker said. ""Give credit to them. They came out playing high energy, playing real physical from the start and that directly translates to the product that happened on the court."" TIP-INS Phoenix: Rookie guard Ty Jerome missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers were kings of the fourth quarter. Portland star Damian Lillard lost his crown, at least for a night anyway. Lou Williams made a go-ahead jumper with 58 seconds left, then added a 3-pointer and finished with 26 points to lift Los Angeles over the Trail Blazers 107-101 on Thursday for coach Doc Rivers' 900th career victory. ""Doc never stops going and grinding,"" Kawhi Leonard said. ""He never gets bored."" Lillard and CJ McCollum led Portland with 22 points apiece, but surprisingly both got blanked in the fourth quarter. That's usually Lillard's time to shine, but the Clippers' defense wasn't having it. ""Usually I can make those shots down the stretch, but they weren't falling,"" Lillard said. ""They were coming out to guard me and picking up full court. Pat Beverley did a good job on defense."" Lillard missed four shots and went 0 for 3 from 3-point range, while McCollum also missed four shots. ""It's the third game that we've won, in my opinion, completely because of our defense,"" Rivers said. ""Our offense was below average. If you can win a game and not play well offensively, that says a lot about your team."" Leonard had 27 points, 13 rebounds and six turnovers after missing a nationally televised loss to Milwaukee the previous night as part of load management for his knee. ""Over the last six minutes of the game, we got stops, got rebounds and made our free throws. Lou also made a big 3 for us,"" Leonard said. ""We played good defense and stuck in there the whole game and we stayed positive. It was a grind-out win for us."" Leonard and Williams combined to score the Clippers' final 15 points. Leonard sealed the win with four straight free throws as fans chanted ""MVP! MVP!"" ""The Lou-him combination was lethal down the stretch,"" Rivers said. With Lillard and McCollum getting shut down, Anfernee Simons scored 16 of his 17 points in the fourth, including Portland's first 12 of the quarter. The Clippers rallied from eight points down early in the period, taking their first lead on Leonard's basket. The Blazers tied it 98-all on a three-point play by Hassan Whiteside. Williams' jumper put the Clippers ahead for good and he followed it up with a 3 -- one of just four made by the Clippers in the game. ""I felt if I had an inch, I'd go for the kill,"" Williams said. The Blazers regained the lead in the third, outscoring the Clippers 36-23. Portland tied it 61-all on McCollum's 3-pointer, spurring an 18-7 run that sent the Blazers into the fourth leading 76-70. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum received a flagrant-1 foul late in the second quarter after his right foot hit Patrick Patterson in the face on a fadeaway jumper. Patterson landed near the LA bench. ""Surprised the foot made it up that high,"" said the 6-foot-8 Patterson. McCollum is 6-3. ""I was playing full speed and I ran into him on the baseline,"" McCollum said. ""I didn't do it on purpose."" ... Portland's 40 points in the first half were its fewest in a half this season. Clippers: Improved to 5-1 at home. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS --  A next-man-up mentality is keeping the Indiana Pacers competitive despite a rash of injuries. T.J. McConnell was the key for the Pacers on Friday night in a 112-106 win over the Pistons that moved Indiana above .500 for the first time this season. Playing all but two minutes of the fourth quarter, McConnell, the backup point guard, finished with 17 points, nine assists and five rebounds on a night the Pacers played without four members of their rotation. ""We've got to hold down the fort until those guys get back,"" McConnell said. ""I've been a guy the last five years who hasn't tried to go outside the box. I had the lane, and I took it."" All-Star Victor Oladipo, starting center Myles Turner and his backup, Goga Bitadze, and sixth man Jeremy Lamb were out due to injury. Detroit had already beaten the Pacers twice this season. And then the Pacers fell behind by 15 points in the first quarter. None of that fazed Indiana, which ranks in the top half of the league on defense. ""Defense is how we win games,"" said reserve Justin Holiday, who chipped in 16 points and six rebounds. ""That's our identity. We've been playing defense."" That has helped the Pacers go 5-1 since starting the season 0-3. ""Our chemistry is growing,"" said Domantas Sabonis, who finished with 17 points, 14 rebounds and six assists. ""Coach (Nate McMillan) runs a great system that is easy to run, no matter who is on the court."" Luke Kennard had 29 points, six rebounds and five assists, and Andre Drummond finished with 15 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists for Detroit. Drummond had averaged 25 points and 20.5 rebounds in the two wins against the Pacers. They finally found a way Friday to slow the two-time All-Star -- foul trouble. Drummond picked up his third foul near midcourt with 4:31 remaining in the first half and sat the rest of the way. Indiana outscored the Pistons 14-2 in that span and led 57-53 at intermission. ""I told Andre you can't pick up your third foul at half court,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""He wasn't thinking in that situation. Just a bad foul that put us in a tough position, and he knows it. He felt bad about it."" The Pacers then opened the third quarter on an 11-2 run, causing Casey to use a timeout. Shortly after play resumed, two more baskets stretched Indiana's lead to 17, and the Pistons never got closer than six. McConnell, whose point total was one shy of his career high, spearheaded a bench effort that accounted for 51 of the Pacers' points on a night the team shot at least 50% from the field for just the second time this season. ""(McConnell) made the difference,"" Casey said. SCREEN CONFUSION In his pregame media session, Casey expressed a degree of frustration in how the league is officiating screens and pick-and-roll plays. ""It changes every possession, maybe every game, what's legal, not legal,"" Casey said. ""Whether you can stick your butt out, or if you slide to your right, use your hands to push off, all of the above, we have to have some clarification. It's very difficult because those are split-second decisions."" TIP-INS Pistons: Star forward Blake Griffin, starting point guard Reggie Jackson and sixth-man extraordinaire Derrick Rose, averaging 20.8 points and 6.3 assists per game, all sat out due to injury. ... Detroit shot 45% with 17 turnovers. Pacers: Warren was assessed a Flagrant 1 for his offensive foul with 2:15 left in the contest. Making both free throws off the flagrant, the Pistons added a 3-pointer for a rare five-point possession. ... Sabonis added 14 boards and six assists. ... The team's video board showed former NFL quarterback Trent Green in attendance. Green played college football at Indiana in the 1990s. He received a round of applause.","401160758"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Big nights by big men Nikola Vucevic and Jonathan Isaac carried the Orlando Magic to their first runaway victory of the season. Vucevic dominated at the offensive end with 23 points, 16 rebounds and six assists. Isaac had 22 points and eight rebounds, but it was his four blocks and game-long presence around the rim that turned the game in Orlando's favor, as the Magic beat the Memphis Grizzlies 118-86. The Magic outscored the Grizzlies 34-8 in the fourth quarter, limiting the visitors to 3-for-23 shooting (13%) and forcing four turnovers. Isaac was the dominating player at the defensive end. ""He was terrific,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""He's so active with his hands, blocking shots. You can see his confidence growing every time he steps on the floor."" The Grizzlies led the NBA in points in the paint. Orlando controlled that stat Friday. ""We only scored 34 points in the paint and that's a credit to him and their entire team,"" Memphis Coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""His defense, his length, his activity, he was really strong at both ends of the floor."" Evan Fournier scored 19 points and Aaron Gordon added 17 for the Magic, who stopped a four-game losing streak. Orlando, which struggled again with its 3-point shooting again (7 of 28), made up for it by outscoring Memphis 62-34 in the paint. Memphis, which had 137 points in its last game, the second-highest total in franchise history, was held under 100 for the second time this season. Jonas Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with 15 points and nine rebounds. Jaren Jackson had 14 points and Brandon Clarke 13 for the Grizzlies, who lost for the fourth time in five games. ""You can look at the stat sheet and go `OK, 34-8 in the fourth quarter,' "" Jenkins said, ""but we weren't good in the first, second or third either to even give us a chance. We were playing catch-up the whole game."" Orlando started the fourth period on a 13-0 run to get some separation from Memphis. Michael Carter-Williams started the fourth-quarter run with a 3-pointer. D.J. Augustin contributed another and Vucevic finished the spurt with a three-point play to make it 97-78 with 7:49 left. Memphis missed its first nine shots of the fourth quarter and turned the ball over three times. Isaac was in the middle of much of that misery, using his length and quickness to bottle up passing lanes for the Grizzlies' guards and force shooters to rush their stroke. ""His defense has been amazing,"" Vucevic said of his teammate. ""I told him in preseason that he could be a candidate for defensive player of the year if he keeps playing like that. I really believe that. He's taking a lot of pride in trying to stop his guy and helping others as well."" The Magic, who made only one of 12 3-pointers in the first half, got four in the third quarter and jumped out to their biggest lead of the game, 79-66, on a dunk by Gordon with 2:23 left in the period. Memphis cut the deficit to 84-78 by the end of the period, but the Grizzlies night-long struggles against the Magic interior defense continued. The Grizzlies' guards got caught in the air too many times and either forced shots or turned the ball over. TIP INS Grizzlies: Memphis hit just five of 19 shots (26.3%) in the first quarter. ... The Grizzlies lead the NBA in points in the paint (57.7 per game), but had only 34. Magic:  F Terrence Ross missed his second straight game with a sore knee. . Orlando hit just one of 12 3-pointers in the first half. ... The Magic are last in the NBA in scoring at 95.1 points a game, and went over 100 points for just the second time this season. ...

"WASHINGTON --  After four decades as a college coach, John Beilein is eight games into his first NBA season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and on Friday night, he recorded his first win on the road. Tristan Thompson had 21 points and 12 rebounds, Kevin Love added 16 points and 12 boards, and the Cavaliers beat the Washington Wizards 113-100 to end a three-game skid. Seven Cavaliers scored at least 10 points as Cleveland improved to 3-5. ""It's always great to get a road win,"" Beilein said. ""I don't care what type of team you have. They guys needed it. When you win somewhere else, it's always special."" Thomas Bryant led Washington with 23 points. Rui Hachimura scored 21 and Bradley Beal had 20 while the Wizards fell to 2-6. ""We didn't defend,"" Beal said. ""That's what happened."" Collin Sexton also had 16 points for Cleveland, and rookies Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr. had career highs with 15 and 13, respectively. Cleveland led throughout and used an 11-0 run to take a 41-28 lead with 9:19 remaining in the second quarter. The lead grew to 20, but thanks to Hachimura's 15 points on 7 for 7 from the field, Washington cut the lead to 67-52 at the half. Cleveland's 10-0 run put them ahead 77-56 early in the third, but the Wizards outscored them 28-11 and trailed by just 88-84 entering the fourth quarter Washington closed to 91-90 on Moe Wagner's layup with 9:39 to play, but Cleveland outscored Washington 22-10 the rest of the way. Thompson had three key baskets in the last two minutes. Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who was assessed a technical foul for the second straight game, felt the key to the game was Cleveland's attempting 29 free throws to Washington's six. ""It's hard to overcome,"" Brooks said. Brooks wouldn't explicitly criticize the officiating. ""Every time I've complained, they say they have the call right,"" Brooks said. TIP INS Cavaliers: G Jordan Clarkson was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter, but Beal missed the free throw. Wizards: F Troy Brown started for the first time this season. He scored three points in 19 minutes. Isaac Bonga started the first seven games of the season but didn't play Friday. ... G Justin Robinson and F Admiral Schofield were recalled from the G League. ... Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo was introduced to the crowd and got an ovation nine days after his team won the World Series. BACK TO SCHOOL Beilein coached Wagner at Michigan. Wagner, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers last season, said it was ""weird"" playing against his college coach. ""Moe is special to me,"" Beilein said. ""There's no doubt about it. It's hard to play against him. I hoped he missed every shot tonight. The other games are fine."" Wagner had eight points and committed four fouls in 14 minutes. ""I hope I get another chance to go against him,"" Wagner said.","401160760"
"ATLANTA --  Once Bogdan Bogdanovic and the Sacramento Kings starting making 3-pointers, they didn't stop. That's just what coach Luke Walton wants to see. Bogdanovic scored 20 points and hit two of his 3-pointers in a key fourth-quarter flurry and the Sacramento Kings fought off Atlanta's comeback attempt to beat the Hawks 121-109 on Friday night. Sacramento led by 21 points in the second period before Trae Young, who had 30 points, led Atlanta's second-half comeback. The Hawks cut the Kings' lead to one point, 94-93, before Sacramento answered with a string of five 3-pointers, including the two by Bogdanovic. The Kings made 18 of 31 3-pointers for the game. ""We have really good shooters on our team,"" Walton said. ""We know that. ... When our guys are open we want them letting it fly."" Buddy Hield led the Kings with 22 points. De'Aaron Fox had 17 with nine assists. Young scored 16 points in the third quarter, when the Hawks whittled away at the Kings' lead. Atlanta's comeback carried into the fourth quarter. Young's steal set up a layup by Cam Reddish, leaving Sacramento's lead one point. Bogdanovic then sparked the Kings' flurry of 3-pointers that ended Atlanta's comeback. ""I think we had to fight too much to get back in the game, and that's something we've got to get better at,"" Young said. After opening the season with five straight losses, the Kings have won three of four. Hield said strong shooting has led the recovery. ""Guys are shooting the ball and making shots at a high clip,"" Hield said. Sacramento led 63-47 at halftime. The Kings' big first-half lead was 21 points, 59-38. Young had only eight points in the first half but scored Atlanta's first three baskets after the break. ""I was mad at the way I played,"" Young said of his quiet first half. ""I wanted to come out and make a difference."" Jabari Parker had 25 points and eight rebounds for Atlanta. Young's 3-pointer trimmed the Kings' lead to 68-54.

Parker has scored in double figures in seven of eight games. SOONERS REUNION In the matchup of high-scoring former Oklahoma standouts, Hield scored 11 points in the third quarter. That helped the Kings overcome Young's hot streak. It also helped prevent Young from finally winning a matchup against his former teammate. ""Obviously I know Buddy,"" Young said. ""... I always try to win when I go up against him. I haven't done it yet."" HOT SHOOTING The Kings built their big first-half lead on 63.4% shooting (26 of 41) from the field.

"MINNEAPOLIS -- Andrew Wiggins scored 40 points, hitting the tying basket late in regulation, and the Minnesota Timberwolves overcame D'Angelo Russell's career-high 52 points to beat the Golden State Warriors 125-119 in overtime Friday night. Russell and the Warriors led 110-106 with 29 seconds left in regulation. But after two free throws by Karl-Anthony Towns and a forced jump ball by Robert Covington, Wiggins tied it on a drive with 5.6 seconds left. Russell's 3-pointer at the buzzer missed. In overtime, Wiggins hit a clinching 3 with 23 seconds left to help the Timberwolves snap a two-game losing streak. Towns battled through foul trouble to score 20 points and grab 14 rebounds. Covington had 17 points and 11 rebounds. Alec Burks scored 18 points off the bench for the Warriors. They have lost five of six. Russell had missed the previous three games for injury-depleted Golden State with a sprained right ankle. His return gave the Warriors their seventh different starting lineup in nine games. His previous career high was 44 points. Three fouls limited Towns to seven points on five shots in 10 first-half minutes. That, along with 17 points from Russell, helped the Warriors to a 61-60 lead at halftime. Golden State was 20-for-20 from the free-throw line in the first half. The Warriors finished the game 23 for 24. TIP INS Warriors G Stephen Curry (fractured left wrist), G Klay Thompson (left ACL surgery), F Kevon Looney (neuropathy), F Draymond Green (sprained left index finger) and F Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) are out. Timberwolves point guards Jeff Teague (illness) and Shabazz Napier (right shoulder sprain) missed their second consecutive game.

"NEW ORLEANS --  The Toronto Raptors tried to balance celebrating an impressive performance by Pascal Siakam and concern over injuries to two of their top players. Siakam matched a career high with 44 points in the Raptors' 122-104 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. As Siakam drained shots, Toronto's medical staff was evaluating injuries to starting point guard Kyle Lowry and sixth-man Serge Ibaka. Lowry suffered a fractured left thumb and Ibaka has a severely sprained ankle. That means the defending NBA Champions will likely be depleted -- at least in the immediate future. But, Siakam showed again Friday he can lead the Raptors to victories as his 44 points matched the career high from a game against the Washington Wizards on Feb. 13. The NBA's Most Improved Player last season scored 16 in the first quarter Friday, and finished 17 of 28 from the floor. He also had 10 rebounds. Siakam attempted a career-high 10 3-pointers, making five. The confident deep shooting is just another sign of his continued growth. ""He's got the green light to make any move he wants at this point,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""No, I'm serious man. We're just trying to get him to see how far he can go here. Drive it, post it, shoot the three, drive it in transition, play pick and roll; we want him to get as many reps as he can."" The 6-foot-9 Siakam briefly ran the Toronto offense to start the fourth quarter with Lowry out and Fred VanVleet resting. Siakam said a rare opportunity to play point guard was an opportunity to work on his ball-handling and overall game. ""I'm just trying to continue to improve, continue to get better and just do what I do- just be myself,"" he said. Toronto used a 45-point second quarter to take control of the game and improved to 6-2. The Pelicans slipped to 1-7. Brandon Ingram led the Pelicans with 27 points. He made just 10 of 25 field goals. Jrue Holiday added 16 points, six rebounds and six assists for New Orleans. The Pelicans kept pace early and the first quarter ended in a 30-30 tie. But the Raptors scored the first 15 points of the second quarter. Toronto parlayed the hot start into a 45-point quarter and a 75-53 halftime lead. In the lopsided first half, the Raptors made 13 of 23 3-pointers (57 and outscored the Pelicans 31-9 on fast-break points. In the game, Toronto shot better from behind the arc (19 of 43, 44.2%) than on two pointers (22 of 50, 44%). Even with Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard leaving in free agency, the Raptors have so far looked like a legitimate contender in the Eastern Conference, and Siakam's continued emergence is a key reason for Toronto's impressive start. ""He's evolving into a superstar,"" Lowry said of Siakam. INJURY DETAILS Lowry said he suffered his thumb injury in the first quarter when he tried to swipe the ball away from Pelicans center Derrick Favors on an offensive rebound. ""It felt weird from the rip,"" Lowry said. ""I kept playing through it and kept playing through it. Originally, we thought it was something in the nail bed because the nail bed turned black and blue. We got some X-rays and we sent the X-rays off to the doctors, and there was a small fracture in the thumb."" Lowry said Friday's injury is unrelated to the surgery he had in July to repair ligaments in the same thumb. Lowry went to the bench after the initial injury, but he returned a couple minutes later. He even made two 3-pointers in the second quarter before subbing out midway through the quarter and retreating to the locker room. Ibaka, who was in a walking boot after the game, suffered his ankle sprain when he contested an Ingram layup with about 1 minute remaining in the second quarter. Ibaka lay on the floor, writhing in pain as play continued, before a Toronto foul allowed two teammates to help him limp off the floor. DEFENSIVE WOES Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry bemoaned his team's defense again after the game. Through eight games, New Orleans has allowed a 40-point quarter and a 70-point half three times. ""Those are hard to survive in this league,"" Gentry said. ""That's where they got the separation, and then once again you're playing uphill the rest of the game and it doesn't matter what kind of run you make."" New Orleans entered Friday allowing a league-worst 124.3 points per game, and after another ugly defensive performance, he hinted there could soon be lineup changes. ""The people we have out there, if they can't do what we're expecting them to do, then the next thing for us to do is that we've got to try to find somebody else,"" he said. TIP-INS Raptors: Norman Powell scored 18 points off the bench. Pelicans: New Orleans shot a season-worst 40.4% from the field. ... Guard Frank Jackson scored 13 points off the bench. Rookie and Toronto native Nickel Alexander-Walker added 13 points. ... Starting point guard Lonzo Ball did not play in the fourth quarter after a rough night that included four turnovers, a season-low two assists and 2-of-8 shooting (5 points).","401160763"
"Prior to his first game against his former team, Kristaps Porzingis says he has ""nothing but love"" for Knicks fans but that he won't dwell on the past. (0:54) DALLAS --  Kristaps Porzingis made his first shot on a 3-pointer and later drove for a tying finger-roll layup that probably reminded the New York Knicks why the 7-foot-3 Latvian with unique offensive skills was once the future of their franchise. The Knicks ended up with the most important thing in their first meeting with their former star: the win, just their second in nine games this season. Marcus Morris scored a season-high 29 points, and New York overcame a career-high 38 points in another triple-double for 20-year-old phenom Luka Doncic, beating the Dallas Mavericks 106-102 on Friday night. Porzingis, who scored 28 points, injured his left knee in his last game with the Knicks on Feb. 6, 2018. He didn't play again until making his Dallas debut this season when the Mavericks decided he wouldn't play last season following the blockbuster trade in January. Almost exactly 21 months since that game, Porzingis played with a purpose early and helped erase a 12-point deficit in the second half, finishing 4 of 8 from 3-point range with nine rebounds and five blocks coming off perhaps his worst showing with the Mavericks. ""Out of all these games, I was probably the most relaxed out there,"" Porzingis said. ""I just wanted to play well and tonight I took a step forward. Whoever it is, I just want to help this team win games."" With the score tied at 92, Porzingis shot an air ball from 3, and the Knicks soon went on a 9-0 run. Morris, a free-agent addition in the offseason, started it with three free throws after Porzingis committed his fifth foul on a 3-pointer. Julius Randle, who grew up in the Dallas area and finished with 21 points, capped it with a jumper. ""I could see how guys would approach it a little extra,"" Morris said of the Knicks playing Porzingis. ""But for me, I've been traded a few times, left some teams with bad tastes in their mouths, so I understand how it goes. It's not about him. It's about us."" Dallas was still within four when rookie R.J. Barrett missed two free throws, but Randle easily beat Porzingis to the rebound and made both free throws after drawing the sixth foul on the centerpiece of a blockbuster deal last January. Doncic had 14 rebounds and 10 assists but also eight turnovers, one shy of the most of the reigning rookie of the year's career. He had a chance to tie after Taj Gibson missed two free throws with 25 seconds left, but pulled up for a 34-footer that bounced off the rim. ""I made a bad decision,"" Doncic said. ""That wasn't the shot I was looking for. I let my team down again. I got to make better choices."" The Mavericks didn't get much help outside their new European pair. Tim Hardaway Jr., who also came to Dallas in the trade, had two late 3-pointers to keep Dallas close, but was just 5 of 15 from the field. He was the only other double-figure scorer for the Mavericks with 14. Barrett, the third overall pick in 2019 after Doncic went with the same choice last year, scored a season-low three points on 1-of-9 shooting. He also missed five of six free throws. ""I wanted my kid to get over that hump tonight so I left him in there to see if he could overcome it,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""He failed this time, but he'll get back on the horse and he'll make his next ones."" TIP-INS Knicks: Bobby Portis had 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Frank Ntilikina had 14 points and four steals. ... The Knicks were 14 of 28 from 3, highlighted by Ntilikina making four of five. Morris was 4 of 8. Mavericks: Doncic made consecutive 3s after starting 1 of 7 from long range, the same finishing total in the previous game against Orlando. He finished 3 of 11. ... After Porzingis, Doncic and Hardaway, the rest of the Mavericks were 8 of 27 from the field. NO SMITH VS. MAVERICKS Dennis Smith Jr., the key piece for New York in the Porzingis trade, missed his sixth straight game after the death of the point guard's stepmother. Smith rejoined the team in Dallas, but coach David Fizdale said Smith was probably another game away from returning. Smith hasn't faced the Mavericks yet, but the teams play again in New York on Thursday. Dallas drafted him ninth overall in 2017, but his future with the Mavericks was clouded by Doncic's arrival as the third overall pick a year later. DUELING CHALLENGES Each coach used his challenge successfully late in the first half, but Rick Carlisle's was a little more important for Dallas because it erased a third foul on Porzingis when he appeared to block Ntilikina's one-handed dunk attempt. The reversal gave Porzingis his second block. Fizdale challenged a charging call against Randle just 1:24 later, with the foul changed to a block on Maxi Kleber. Randle missed both free throws, though.","401160764"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic lofted the winning shot and then pleaded for it to fall as he tumbled to the floor. ""I was hoping,"" he said. ""I mean, you're happy that you didn't miss, because then everybody will be mad at you. The whole arena is going to be disappointed."" Instead, the Denver Nuggets big man sent the fans home with a game they won't soon forget. Jokic hit a 20-foot jumper on a broken play with 1.2 seconds remaining, helping the Nuggets rally from a 21-point, fourth-quarter deficit to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 100-97 on Friday night. It's the largest fourth-quarter comeback in their history, the team said. Jokic scored 16 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, none bigger than his jumper from the left side of the court that he saw go in from the floor. Before his shot, Jokic was trying to get the ball to Paul Millsap, who couldn't get off an attempt. He passed it back to Jokic. On the next possession, Jokic drew an offensive foul on Joel Embiid by fronting him near the basket. It was the sixth foul on a frustrated Embiid. ""I'm kind of heavy. He needs to push a lot just to push me out,"" Jokic cracked. ""I felt he pushed me too strong."" Embiid saw things different after watching the replay. ""If you want to call that foul, especially at that time of the game, it's kind of (expletive), especially because he was hooking me before that foul actually happened,"" Embiid said. A similar feeling for Sixers coach Brett Brown. ""I've just seen the foul that was called on Joel and I have no words,"" Brown said. ""When you see that particular play, I have no words. We give them credit. We weren't able to find a way to win on the road."" Denver hung in there with defense until the offense picked up. Will Barton hit two free throws to seal the win. ""Says a lot about this team, the heart,"" Paul Millsap said. ""We want to have the heart of a champion. That's what champions do, they continue to fight. We were able to get some stops."" Jamal Murray, bloody nose and all, had 22 points for the Nuggets, who've won three straight games since coach Michael Malone called out his team for their energy level. No questioning their energy in this one. Philly hit the first shot of the final quarter to go up 21 and then it was all Denver. The Nuggets didn't take their first lead of the fourth until Jokic's jumper. His 16 points in the final period outscored the Sixers' 13 total points. The matchup in the middle between two of the top centers in the NBA proved highly entertaining. For once, Jokic got the better of Embiid in the stat that mattered most -- wins. Jokic is 1/3 against Embiid when they both play, according to Basketball-Reference. Jokic was first team All-NBA last season, and Embiid second team. A breakdown of the numbers: Jokic had 11 rebounds and six assists. Embiid finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris and Raul Neto each had 13 points for the Sixers, who finished 1/3 on their four-game Western swing. They were without Ben Simmons after he sprained the AC joint in his right shoulder Wednesday in Utah. Neto started in his place. The 7-foot Jokic lost his cool late in the first quarter after not getting a call when he was grabbed while going up for a shot. Jokic held out his hands in exasperation toward official Scott Wall, who ignored him at first and then issued a technical. TIP-INS 76ers: G/F Shake Milton remained out with a left knee bone bruise/sprain. ... Simmons will be evaluated again before Sunday's game against Charlotte. ... G Trey Burke picked up a technical in the second quarter.  ... The Philly bench combined for 37 points, while the Nuggets' reserves had 12. Nuggets: Millsap played with 11 stitches above his right eye after a collision on a fast-break last game. Wearing a headband, he finished with 15 points. SENSE OF HUMOR Malone got to know Embiid through the ""Basketball Without Borders"" program a few years back. Malone was a coach of the African squad. ""I won't get into the stories,"" Malone cracked. ""Joel has a great personality. He has a great sense of humor. I did enjoy my time being around him in a short period of time during that camp.""","401160765"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Bojan Bogdanovic didn't hesitate to ask his new coach for the final shot. With 1.3 seconds left, Utah coach Quin Snyder drew up a play the Jazz practiced earlier Friday, but Bogdanovic said he wanted the ball. ""Mike (Conley) was supposed to be in that corner, but I asked him if he could go to the other,"" Bogdanovic said. Joe Ingles faked a pass to his right and then threw it to Bogdanovic near the left corner -- one of his favorite spots. Ingles raised both his arms before the 3-pointer even settled into the net, and Utah beat the Milwaukee Bucks 103-100. Players ran from the bench and mobbed a smiling Bogdonovic at midcourt. Bogdonovic finished with 33 points. Utah's Donovan Mitchell was driving for a possible winner when George Hill stripped the ball and called timeout with 2.3 seconds left. Milwaukee inbounded to Khris Middleton, but he traveled as Rudy Gobert flew at him. The clock was reset to 1.3 seconds, giving the Jazz one last chance. ""It was big that we could close that out and get that win,"" said Gobert, who missed two free throws and had a late turnover before his defensive heroics. ""If we lose that game at the end after all that, it would have really hurt."" Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 28 of his 30 points in the second half, hit a 3 and made a follow shot to give the Bucks their first and only lead, 89-88, but later fouled out and wasn't on the court for the dizzying finish. ""I was like, `How bad can it get?' We're down 22. I couldn't get it going but I decided to be aggressive, try and go downhill, try and shoot shots and make plays. Obviously, I was just trying to power through guys,"" Antetokounmpo said. Bogdanovic made five 3-pointers and all 10 free throws on a night when nothing seemed to come easy for most players. ""I was surprised I had a standing ovation, even that I hit a game-winner, so it was a great atmosphere, like a playoff crowd,"" Bogdonovic said. Mike Conley had 20 points, and Mitchell finished with 20, but it was Bogdanovic's time to shine. ""Bogey's still showing the world what he can do. A lot of people still don't know that he's that good, but he really is,"" Conley said. Middleton scored 26 points and Eric Bledsoe had 22 for Milwaukee. The Bucks had won four in a row. ""I think we played as hard as we could. We didn't make shots,"" said Middleton, whose team shot 36%. ""The guys out there gave it our all. It came down to two plays down the stretch that cost us the game."" Mitchell's step-back jumper put Utah up 100-92, but Bledsoe made a couple quick hoops and Middleton made two free throws with 8.0 seconds remaining to knot it at 100. The Jazz led by 25 in the first half, but Antetokounmpo sparked a 21-5 run to start the third quarter and it was tight from there. The Bucks have lost 18 consecutive games since their last road win over the Utah Jazz on Oct. 30, 2001. LOTS TO LEARN, EVEN FROM A WIN The Jazz blew a 22-point lead in the first half and an eight-point advantage in the final 1:31. Snyder noted the jubilation had a tinge of angst. ""Giving up rebounds on a free throw, fouling length of the court, going after an offensive rebound at the wrong time -- there were a number of things that we need to look at it and we will,"" Snyder said. ""We should feel really good about this win ... but there's a lot of things we need to learn from that game."" TIP INS Bucks: Brook Lopez picked up his fifth foul midway through the third quarter and only scored five points. ... Coach Mike Budenholzer unsuccessfully challenged Antetokounmpo's sixth foul on a dunk attempt by Gobert with 53.9 seconds to play. ... The Bucks forced 20 turnovers. Jazz: Dante Exum is still inactive as he recovers from knee surgery, Ed Davis has a fractured leg and Emmanuel Mudiay sat out with hamstring tightness. ... Antetokounmpo poked Bogdanovic in the eye in the fourth quarter and appeared to dislodge his contact lens.","401160766"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Damian Lillard's career- and franchise-high scoring game wasn't enough for the Portland Trail Blazers to get their first home victory of the season. Lillard scored a career-high 60 points for Portland in the Trail Blazers' 119-115 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 34 points and Kyrie Irving had 33 for Brooklyn to help send Portland to its fourth consecutive loss. ""He got 60, but luckily for us he would've needed 65,"" Dinwiddie said of Lillard after the game. Lillard set a franchise record with the highest-scoring game of the season in the NBA. He was 19-of-33 from the field, 7-of-16 from 3-point range and made all 15 of his free throws. ""We tried zone, box-and-one, we tried blitz, we threw the kitchen sink at him,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said of Lillard. ""He just kept making incredible shots."" Earlier Friday night, Warriors guard D'Angelo Russell had 52 points in Golden State's 125-119 overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. It marked just the second time in NBA history that there were multiple 50-point scorers on the same day and both lost, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research. The other came April 9, 1978, when David Thompson of the Nuggets had 73 and George Gervin of the Spurs had 63, both in losing causes. ""It's fine,"" Lillard said about his 60 points coming in a loss. ""It's whatever. Anytime you set records it's obviously good. I guess it's not as fun losing."" Irving, the NBA's second-leading scorer coming in to the game, did his part in the guard matchup for the Nets. He had nine fourth-quarter points and hit a shot to put the Nets up 117-112 with 17.8 seconds left. ""The game could have gone either way as well as [Lillard] was playing,"" Irving said. ""Anytime someone has a big performance like that, it can go either way when he can really take over the game like he did."" Irving said he was also proud of Dinwiddie's performance. ""I'm just trying to stay on him to stay aggressive to be the kind of player he wants to be,"" Irving said of his backcourt mate. ""Tonight was a fresh start for him going into this road trip."" CJ McCollum struggled for most of the night for Portland, missing 14 of his first 16 shots and finishing with only eight points on 4-of-19 shooting. The normally efficient McCollum has struggled to start the season from the field, shooting 38% overall and just 32% from the 3-point line. ""Obviously you'd like to make shots and I haven't,"" McCollum said. ""I'm not playing the way I want to play offensively, that's quite obvious."" "" While the win was big for the Nets as they begin their first long road trip, the loss was Portland's fourth straight as the Blazers fell to 0-3 at home this season. Lillard has been disappointed with the way last season's Western Conference finalists have finished games so far. ""I think we in position to win games and we in position in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter you've got to be present mentally and physically,"" Lillard said. ""You have to do a little bit more than the other team to win games. I think we compete. I think we're together. I think we try to do the right things but that little bit of wanting it more than the other team. And wanting it more doesn't mean playing harder, it means being able to be sharper on one more possession."" Starting small forward Rodney Hood left the game in the first quarter and did not return due to back spasms. That meant first-round pick Nassir Little made his NBA debut. Little got a block and a basket during his first NBA shift, helping Portland cut what had been a 10-point lead down to five. He finished with eight points and three rebounds. ""He had a lot of energy,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of Little's performance. ""I thought he had some momentum plays. I liked his athleticism, his dunks he got the crowd into the game, got our bench into it."" TIP-INS Nets: The stellar play of Irving hasn't been the only bright spot through a 4-4 start. The Nets came into Friday ranked first in the NBA in offensive rebound percentage, which came as an encouraging development to Atkinson. ""I saw that and I was a little surprised,"" Atkinson said. ""We'll see if we can sustain it. But I'm glad because we've also been pretty good at transition defense. If we were 30th in transition defense, I'd be worried. The fact we are balancing those two is a good sign. "" The Nets faced an added challenge Friday as they were without backup center DeAndre Jordan. With no real replacement for him on the roster, the Nets will have to platoon at that spot. ""By committee, we can go big, we can go small,"" Atkinson said. ""We'll see a little bit of both."" Trail Blazers: Adding injury to insult, the Blazers lost another big man when Skal Labissiere suffered a sprained right ankle in the fourth quarter. After losing forward-center Zach Collins for the next few months due to shoulder surgery last week, an injury to Labissiere is the last thing the Blazers need as centers Jusuf Nurkic (leg) and Pau Gasol (foot) are still out indefinitely recovering from their own injuries. Stotts did not have an update on Labissiere or Hood after the game.","401160767"
"LOS ANGELES --  Miami trimmed the Los Angeles Lakers' lead to six points with nearly nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, and Staples Center buckled in for a big finish between two NBA division leaders. Instead, the Heat missed their next 13 shots and scored only six more points all night. The Lakers have two of the world's best offensive players in their lineup, but they're leading the overall NBA standings because of what they're doing on the other end. ""One thing about it -- if your offense is behind your defense, you're a really, really good team,"" LeBron James said. ""And I'm OK with that right now."" Anthony Davis had 26 points and nine rebounds, and James scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' seventh consecutive victory, 95-80 over the Heat on Friday night. James hit a pair of clutch 3-pointers in the waning minutes to seal another impressive win for the Lakers, who haven't lost since their season opener against the Clippers. Davis and James both had moments of brilliance with the ball in their hands, but the Lakers are looking impressive on the defensive end during their outstanding start. ""I had high expectations about what we could be,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have a ton of defensive talent, (and) because the care factor has been high, it's come together pretty quickly."" Miami went 4 of 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Lakers held the Heat to one field goal and six points in the final 8:54. LA limited the Heat to 6-of-35 shooting on 3-pointers and outrebounded them 48-37 to win a meeting of division leaders off to outstanding starts to the new season. ""It's our way,"" Davis said. ""We want to be a good defensive team. That team scores, I think, 115 (points) or something a game. We knew they were coming off a back-to-back, and we just wanted them to make them make shots. They had looks they missed. For the most part, we wanted to run them off the line. They're No. 1 in 3-point field goal percentage, and we held them to 17%."" Butler scored 22 points and Goran Dragic added 19 for the Heat, who still lead the Southeast Division despite losing twice on their three-game Western road trip. One night after scoring 124 points in a win at Phoenix, Miami couldn't find a consistent offensive rhythm. ""Even in the first half, we were playing this game in the mud,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Obviously, we didn't have all of us. We're not making any excuses by any means. That's a great team. ... It just got away from us in the fourth quarter. I still thought we were there with six points, but they just scored three straight possessions and went from there."" Butler scored nine points in the third quarter to keep Miami in striking distance despite its 3-for-24 start on 3-pointers, including 11 consecutive misses spanning halftime. ""They put a lot of pressure on defense,"" Dragic said of the Lakers. ""(With) their rebounding and their skills, you have two really good players. We tried to crowd them as much as possible, and we feel like we did a good job, but then in the end they got 10 more rebounds than us, so that was probably the key."" A THOUSAND TWENTIES James became the third player in NBA history to score 20 points in 1,000 career games. Only Karl Malone (1,134) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,122) have done it more often. James has played 1,206 games in his 17-year career. Kobe Bryant only did it 941 times. ZONE BREAK Miami led for only one possession all night despite employing a zone defense that bothered the Lakers' offense early on. Los Angeles swiftly adjusted to the scheme and moved the ball effectively, getting 30 assists on its 40 field goals. Vogel's plan put the ball in Davis' hands near the free throw line to break down the defense, and he responded with a season-high seven assists. ""Once we get the ball in the middle of the floor, you know, it's pick your poison,"" Davis said. ""I can score, or I can throw a lob to JaVale (McGee) or Dwight (Howard), or find the shooters in the corner. Once we get the ball in the middle of the zone, the rest is just making a play."" TIP-INS Heat: Dwyane Wade watched from the baseline near the Miami bench. The retired superstar spoke to the Heat earlier in the day. Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, are living in nearby ShermanOaks. Wade's oldest son, Zaire, is playing high school basketball with Bronny James at Sierra Canyon. ... Derrick Jones Jr. sat out with a left hip strain. Justise Winslow is in the concussion protocol. Lakers: Rajon Rondo still isn't ready to make his season debut. He has a strained right calf. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  In the midst of Boston's most dominant performance of the season, Celtics point guard Kemba Walker could only muster anger and confusion after learning Gordon Hayward broke his left hand. Jaylen Brown scored 30 points and Boston routed the San Antonio Spurs 135-115 on Saturday in a victory tempered by the loss of Hayward, who will miss at least a month and could face surgery after breaking his left hand late in the first half. ""I was in shock,"" Walker said. ""In those kinds of situations, it's kind of hard to say anything. You just don't even know what to say sometimes. We're going to miss him for the time that he's out."" Walker add 26 points as Boston (7-1) won its seventh straight game and set season highs for total points, first quarter scoring (39 points) and first-half scoring (72 points). There was a somberness to the victory, though, after Hayward suffered his second significant injury since signing with the Celtics three seasons ago. The 6-foot-7 forward missed the 2017 season after breaking his leg six minutes into Boston's season opener. ""This one doesn't feel near as bad as it did two years ago,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""So, he'll be back. Be off for a few weeks or a month or whatever it is."" The Celtics forward broke his left hand after colliding with San Antonio's LaMarcus Aldridge with just over a minute remaining in the first half. Hayward was sent for an X-ray that confirmed the diagnosis. He did not return to the game. ""Going to get with the doctors tomorrow and decide if he needs to do surgery or not,"" Stevens said. ""Sounds like should he decide that the surgery option (is best, it) might actually be a better timeline. So, we'll see what that all plays out to be."" DeMar DeRozan had 22 points for the Spurs (5-4), who trailed by as many as 22 points in a lackluster effort of an early tipoff. ""What surprises me is that we were so unaggressive and so unphysical,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. Boston has not lost since dropping its season opener to Philadelphia, 107-93, on Oct. 23. The Celtics have outscored their opponents 115-101 since that loss and raised that dominance against the Spurs. Boston sped up its pace and went on a 19-3 run after giving up the game's first seven points. Every Celtics starter scored during the run, including seven straight points from Brown to ignite the rally. Popovich called a full timeout and replaced all five of his starters in one mass substitution five minutes into the game, but that didn't stem Boston's momentum. ""They move the ball extremely well, they play well together and we caught onto that a little bit too late,"" DeRozan said. The dominance continued throughout the second quarter until Hayward exited. Hayward winced in pain after banging his left hand against Aldridge's chest attempting to get past the Spurs forward on a screen late in the first half. Hayward appeared to jam the hand once or twice more against Aldridge before exiting the game. ""Gordon's really playing well right now and we're leaning on him to help us with this season and this run we're trying to make,"" Brown said. ""I know that's really tough. Any time you deal with an injury like that, that's disheartening."" Hayward had nine points and two rebounds in 15 minutes before exiting. STILL RIDING San Antonio reserve point guard Derrick White continued to ride a stationary bike to stay loose after suffering a hard fall to the court against the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 3. White remained in the game against the Lakers following the fall, but his backside has tightened up since. ""I felt better today than I have the past couple of games,"" White said. ""Just try to keep it loose the best I can."" White said his time away from the bench should end soon. ""Maybe next game and then that will be it,"" White said. ""I don't like being over there but I've got to do what I've got to do."" TIP-INS Celtics: Center Enes Kanter missed his seventh straight game after suffering a bruised left knee in Boston's season opener. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Kanter felt good after participating in pregame workouts but is still not ready to play. ... Marcus Smart exited with 9:47 remaining in the game after taking a knee to the groin. Smart attempted to walk off the injury but quickly signaled for a substitution after doubling over in pain. Spurs: Aldridge averaged 40 points per game against Boston last season but was limited to three points on 1-for-4 shooting Saturday. . San Antonio's last home loss to Boston was March 31, 2011. Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce combined for 63 points in the victory.","401160769"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry could only manage a sarcastic grin after his team's second win of the season. He knows it wasn't pretty. ""Well, I don't think they're sending that (game tape) to Springfield anytime soon,"" Gentry said, referring to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Brandon Ingram had 25 points and nine rebounds, and New Orleans overcame 26 turnovers to beat the Charlotte Hornets 115-110 on Saturday night. Charlotte had 22 turnovers, making for a sloppy game all around that lacked any type of flow until the final minutes. JJ Redick, who replaced the injured Lonzo Ball in the starting lineup, had 22 points on five 3-pointers and Jrue Holiday added 12 points and 11 assists for the Pelicans (2-7). Ball sat out with a right abductor sprain. ""I just thought we turned the ball over way too much, we've just got to get better in that department right there. And they're careless turnovers,"" Gentry said. ""... We grinded it out and found a way to win and to me that's the most important thing."" Despite the ugly win, it was another solid performance for Ingram, who was born and raised in Kinston, North Carolina. He finished 8 of 12 from the field and had 10 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Pelicans seize the momentum while the Hornets went cold down the stretch, going 3  1/2 minutes during one stretch without a point. ""I mean B.I. is a baller, that's our go-to guy, him and Jrue down the stretch we want to get the ball in their hands and just let them make plays even for themselves or for other people,"" said Pelicans forward Kenrick Williams. Hornets coach James Borrego wasn't pleased with his team's performance, either. ""It's sloppy execution, it's not taking pride in making the right play or pass,"" Borrego said. With the game tied at 95 with five minutes left, Josh Hart knocked down a go-ahead 3 igniting an 11-2 run that figured to be the difference in the game. Hart had 10 points and seven rebounds coming off the bench. GRAHAM KEEPS ROLLING Backup point guard Devonte Graham led the Hornets with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Graham entered the game ranked third among all bench players in the league with seven assists per game. But the second-year player from Kansas was more concerned about the overall sloppy play, saying ""we talk about it all the time, you've got to limit the turnovers. We did a good job of that the last couple of games, but this game we were a little lazy with the ball."" REDICK SHINES The Pelicans were able to get Redick involved in the offense, and he looked just as confident as ever shooting the 3. ""For the first time this season I feel like we were able to free JJ up for some good looks that he didn't really try to have to force up,"" Gentry said. ""We did a good job early on with the pace of the game and we got him into a situation where we were able to drive and kick and have him have some good looks and he took advantage of it I thought."" TIP INS Pelicans: There were dozens of fans in the crowd with Zion Williamson jerseys, although the No. 1 overall pick remains out of action recovering from a knee injury. ... In the something-you-don't-see every day category, Nicolo Melli was originally credited with a 3-pointer in the second quarter, but when officials went back to review the play they realized he had stepped out of bounds and the basket was taken away. Hornets: Malik Monk showed his athleticism when he skied high above Josh Hart and threw down a one-handed dunk off an alley-oop pass from Devonte Graham. ... Rookie P.J. Washington missed a good chunk of the game with an ankle injury but did return.","401160770"
"CHICAGO --  For James Harden, a missed shot simply means the odds of him making the next one improve. That attitude served the All-Star guard well Saturday night as he rebounded from a slow start to put up big numbers again. Harden narrowly missed his first triple-double of the season, finishing with 42 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists as the Houston Rockets pulled away in the second half and beat the Chicago Bulls 117-94. After going 2 for 7 (including 1 for 5 on 3-pointers) in the first quarter, he went 10 for 20 the rest of the game, including 8 for 14 on 3's. ""That's the confidence I have,"" he said. ""That's the confidence that I've built off of the work I put in. It's more of a mindset."" Harden, the NBA's leading scorer, entered the game averaging 36.5 points on 38.7% shooting, including 27% on 3-pointers. ""I feel like a broken record sometimes, but he's a master of getting what he wants,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said of Harden. ""I think sometimes he might get bored in the game and tries different stuff."" Russell Westbrook scored 26 points as the Rockets won their third straight. Wendell Carter Jr. had 13 points and 16 rebounds for Chicago, which has dropped six of eight. The Bulls were a woeful 4-for-32 shooting from 3-point range. ""I know how well we can shoot and tonight we just didn't make them,"" Chicago forward Lauri Markkanen said. Chicago led 27-20 after one quarter behind eight points from Markkanen and eight Houston turnovers. The Bulls led by nine points (31-22) early in the second before the Rockets used a 24-7 run to take control and open a 46-38 lead with four minutes left in the first half. Harden had nine points during the run. Chicago closed within 50-49 at halftime on a 3-pointer by Zach LaVine. That was the Bulls second make in 17 first-half attempts from long range. Houston quickly reclaimed control with a 30-9 run in the opening 9:41 of the third, taking an 80-58 advantage. The Rockets had an 86-67 lead entering the fourth, helped by 7-for-14 shooting from 3-pointers range in the third. Harden led the way with 11 points in the quarter. The Bulls couldn't get closer than 14 points in the fourth quarter. ""I think we did really good in the first half; they just broke it open in the third quarter,"" LaVine said. ""We played a good first half and a bad second half."" Harden, who has 35 regular-season triple-doubles in his career, had several minutes of garbage time in the fourth quarter to get additional assists, but was unsuccessful before leaving with a little more than three minutes remaining. ""I didn't even know I was one assist away,"" he said. ""I'm happy we won, though."" NUMBERS GAME Houston went 19 for 44 (43.2%) on 3-pointers to clearly outclass the Bulls from behind the arc. ""They made 19 threes, we made four, so we lost the 3-point line by 45 points,"" Chicago coach Jim Boylen said. ""It's hard to win a game."" DEFENSE Westbrook believes the Rockets had a lot to do with the Bulls' poor shooting. ""If you're gonna win in this league, you've got to defend,"" he said. ""There are no nights off. You've got to defend every single night against some tough teams."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon (left hamstring) returned after sitting out Wednesday against Golden State. He had nine points and 21 minutes off the bench. ... Houston has won the last seven games against Chicago, including the last four at the United Center.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Luka Doncic missed his fifth triple-double of the season primarily because Dallas didn't need him in the fourth quarter. Doncic had 24 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists to lead the Mavericks to a 138-122 victory over Memphis on Saturday night. Doncic recorded his stats in three quarters as Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle sat the second-year guard while Dallas maintained a double-digit lead in the final period. Kristaps Porzingis already had taken the night off recovering from a left knee injury. ""It was a really good effort from start to finish,"" Carlisle said. ""Had a real even contribution from top to bottom. The second unit, obviously came in and was very strong."" Doncic was part of eight Mavericks reaching double figures as Dallas had its highest scoring output of the season. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 20 points for Dallas, Justin Jackson had 17 points and Seth Curry scored 16, all in the first half. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 23 points on 10-for-17 shooting from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers. Jae Crowder added 18 points for the Grizzlies, which lost their second straight. Memphis played without leading scorer and rookie Ja Morant, who took the night off for rest. Additionally, rookie forward Brandon Clarke did not play due to injury maintenance on a sore back. For the Grizzlies, the offense is there, but the defense is not. The Mavericks' 138 points was the most surrendered by Memphis this season. Over the last three games, opponents have averaged just more than 125 points a game. ""The numbers are off the chart,"" Memphis center Jonas Valanciunas said. ""We've got to do a better job on defense."" Before Doncic took the rest of the night off, he helped Dallas pull away in the third quarter, scoring 14 points to give the Mavericks a 104-91 lead entering the fourth. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins noted his team's defensive struggles, including the Mavericks connecting on 18 3-pointers. ""That makes it tough,"" Jenkins said. ""But back-to-back nights, as we try to solidify this defensive identity about anchoring down, protecting the paint and (no) second-chance points, it's a struggle."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Boban Marjanovic started his first game of the season. ... The stop in Memphis was the first of a three-game, six-day road trip that will carry Dallas 3,535 miles. ...

G Grayson Allen missed his fourth straight game with left ankle soreness. ... Rookie Marko Guduric scored 14 points, the first time he has reached double figures in the young season. MAVERICK ROTATIONS Carlisle shuffled players through the night, no one playing 30 minutes, and the reserves provided 67 points. ""We've got a lot of guys that can contribute on any given night,"" Justin Jackson said. ""I think it showed (Saturday), for sure. .Whether you are starting, you're not playing, or you are just playing a little bit, you have to go out and make your minutes count.""

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Despite beating the banged-up Golden State Warriors for the second time this season, the Oklahoma City Thunder know they need to be more consistent. Danilo Gallinari scored 19 points, Dennis Schroder added 18, and the Thunder beat the Warriors 114-108 on Saturday night. Oklahoma City led by 23 late in the second quarter before Golden State roared back to tie the score heading to the fourth. The Thunder then went up by 14 midway through the fourth, and the Warriors mounted another rally before falling short. ""I mean we showed that we can turn it on, but you know that's not going to work most nights in the league,"" said the Thunder's Chris Paul, who had 16 points and nine assists. Steven Adams scored 13 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 12 to help the Thunder win for the third time in four games.

One night earlier, Russell had a career-high 52 against Minnesota. Alec Burks had 23 points for the Warriors, and Glenn Robinson III finished with 18. Omari Spellman sprained his left ankle and didn't return after halftime. ""We are a young team that is learning, but I'm not happy with where we are,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""We should not just accept our fate.

Oklahoma City: The Thunder had 30 assists on 43 made baskets, using terrific ball movement and great screens to spring shooters. Schroder led the Thunder with six assists. ""I think we moved it really well especially in the first half,"" Mike Muscala said. ""I think all of our guards do such a good job finding guys and moving the ball. It's fun to play like that."" 3-POINT BARRAGE The Thunder weren't afraid to shoot, going 14 for 30 (46.7 percent) on 3-point attempts after coming into the contest averaging 35.7 percent.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  One game after a team-record comeback, the Denver Nuggets allowed the Minnesota Timberwolves to nearly do the same. Nikola Jokic saved Denver each time. Jokic hit a fadeaway jumper with 2.4 seconds left to give the Nuggets a 100-98 overtime victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. ""At this point, you just sit back and watch it,"" Denver forward Paul Millsap said. ""I believe in the shots he's making, and in those situations we've just got to give it to him."" Jokic was in a similar spot, hitting a winning jumper with 2.2 seconds left Friday night in a comeback victory at home against Philadelphia.

Millsap scored all 14 of his points during a big third-quarter run and had 10 rebounds. ""They had really good momentum and we didn't shoot well,"" Jokic said of the late-game collapse. ""They were really aggressive. But they sent it to overtime, which was good for us. It gave us options to win the game."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 25 points and 16 rebounds for Minnesota. Towns pushed the game to overtime with a corner 3, but the Wolves shot a season-low 13.3% from 3-point range and 35.1% overall from the field. Andrew Wiggins added 25 points in Minnesota's third loss in four games. ""We understand we play tomorrow,"" Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""We said with about six minutes left, we're going to make one push here, give it about a minute and a half. We're down 16. These guys came back, they fought. I give so much credit to our players."" Denver led by 16 in the fourth when Gary Harris hit a 3 with 6:41 left. The Nuggets went scoreless the remainder of regulation and Minnesota put together a 16-0 streak. ""We have to better in terms of playing with the lead and closing games out,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""But we never panicked. I thought Will Barton down the stretch was huge -- he made some big plays for us. Poised, he was under control. Nikola makes another improbable shot. He just adds to the legend of Nikola Jokic."" KEEP SHOOTING With Saunders, Minnesota has placed an added emphasis on the 3 this year. The Wolves entered the game with the third-most attempts in the league at 40.5 per-game. But they were just 25th while hitting 31.8% of the shots. Minnesota was 0 for 10 from beyond the arc in the third as Denver took control, and 2 for 22 in the second half and overtime. The Wolves' previous worst 3-point shooting performance was Friday night against Golden State when it was 9 of 36. They are 15 of 81 from 3 in the two games. ""There was a lot of good looks,"" said forward Robert Covington, who was 0 of 2 from 3. ""Them shots are going to fall, it's just, got to believe in them, that's all."" MURRAY'S MIX Coming off one of his best games of the season, Denver point guard Jamal Murray was clicking early, scoring 12 of the team's first 19 points while making all five of his shots. Murray left the game just 41 seconds into the second half with left foot soreness but later returned. He scored all 15 of his points in the first half and was 0-of-8 shooting in the second half. TIP INS Nuggets: Backup guard Malik Beasley left with an illness after playing five scoreless minutes. ... The Nuggets are 22-9 at Target Center since 2004-05. Timberwolves: Point guards Jeff Teague (illness) and Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain) each missed their third straight game. ... Minnesota had one turnover in the first quarter. .

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Even without injured stars Victor Oladipo and Myles Turner, the Indiana Pacers are managing to pile up wins. Domantas Sabonis had 21 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists, and Malcolm Brogdon and T.J. Wareen each scored 19 to help the Pacers beat the Orlando Magic 109-102 on Sunday for their sixth win in seven games. Doug McDermott had 18 points and T.J. McConnell added 12 points and eight assists and were the difference-makers as Indiana erased a nine-point halftime deficit by outscoring Orlando 58-42 in the second half. ""I thought both groups (starters and reserves) were solid, but you need your second group to play like these guys have been playing,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We had good ball movement, our guys were sharing the ball and defending hard. When you do that, you're going to be tough to beat."" Evan Fournier scored 22 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 17 rebounds, and Aaron Gordon added 13 points as the Magic lost for the fifth time in six games. Orlando had its best offensive half of the season in the first two quarters, shooting 55.3 percent, including eight of 13 from behind the 3-point line. The second half was a totally different story. Indiana limited the Magic to 35.7 percent shooting, overtaking Orlando with 12-0 and 18-8 runs to start the third and fourth quarters respectively. ""They scored every which way you could in the first half,"" McMillan said. ""We really put no pressure on them at all, but we did a better job establishing our defense and getting pressure on the ball in the second half."" The Pacers led 81-77 going into the fourth quarter and pushed the lead to 14 points with a spark from McConnell. The Magic guards couldn't stay with McConnell on the pick-and-roll and the Pacers' backup point guard made them pay, hitting three straight short jumpers. He also had four assists in the game-deciding run, two to McDermott, who hit seven of 13 shots for the game. ""I think the second unit is always going to provide energy,"" McConnell said. ""I think that's what a bench is supposed to do. We're getting more comfortable with each other, we're finding each other, moving without the ball, screening, executing and that's really all you can ask."" Orlando made only three of its first 15 shots in the fourth before D.J. Augustin's runner got things back on track. The closest the Magic could get was 105-99 on a driving layup by Markell Fultz with 40 seconds to play. However, Brogdon made a 3-pointer on Indiana's next possession to put the game away. ""I'm surprised and really disappointed,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""To start the third quarter, they crushed us. The two most important players in the game, in my opinion, were (T.J.) McConnell and (Doug) McDermott. Those two guys drilled us."" The Pacers erased a 60-51 halftime deficit by scoring the first 12 points of the second half, including six straight from Brogdon at the end of the run. Indiana outscored Orlando 31-17 in the quarter, hitting 12 of 22 shots (59 percent). The first half was Orlando's best offensive half of the season. The Magic shot 55.3 percent, including eight of 13 from behind the 3-point line. Fournier hit all three of his 3s and four of five shots for 11 points, and Vucevic also had 11 to help Orlando to its nine-point halftime lead.

Indiana had only five attempts, four in the second half. ""We looked at that at halftime and they had zero attempts so that meant we weren't being aggressive,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""Not that you want to be out there fouling, but they were burning us without going to the free throw line so we just needed to be more aggressive and our guys responded.""","401160775"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons watched the 76ers' game in street clothes, bothered by a shoulder injury but feeling downright sunny about their chances after a rough road trip. ""I feel great,"" Simmons said. ""Woke up on a beautiful Sunday, excited to see my team play."" The 76ers were delighted to give an effort worth watching. Joel Embiid returned from a bumpy road trip in which his maturityand fitness were questioned to score 18 points and grab nine rebounds, and Furkan Korkmaz scored 17 points to help Philadelphia snap a three-game losing streak with a 114-106 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night. Embiid played in Philly for the first time since his Oct. 30 fight with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns earned the All-Star center a two-game suspension. Embiid missed the first two games of a four-game road trip (including a win at Portland) and huffed and puffed his way through a lethargic defensive effort in a loss in the finale at Denver. Coach Brett Brown blamed Embiid's ineffectiveness on the layoff and the altitude in Colorado. ""It's clear the time off for Joel didn't help,"" Brown said. ""Joel didn't have one of the Joel games that we need."" He seemed up for the challenge at home. Embiid hustled from the opening tip and scored 15 points in the first half in a mismatched matchup against Bismack Biyombo and Cody Zeller. He blocked a Devonte Graham shot that led to a James Ennis III slam on the other end, and pump-faked his way into a basket and a foul whistled on Biyombo. Embiid, though, couldn't do much when the Hornets ripped a 12-2 run late in the half to take a 58-53 lead into the break. He only played 26 minutes (shot 6 of 10 overall) and got a breather down the stretch once the 76ers blew this one open in the fourth. Embiid passed the fitness test -- but declined to talk to the media. ""We're trying to get Joel in increasingly better and better and better shape,"" Brown said. ""I thought Zeller made him run a lot in the first half."" Korkmaz keyed a Sixers' run in the third quarter in their return home from the 1/3 trip. Korkmaz hit a 3 with just 0.4 seconds left to beat Portland for Philadelphia's lone win on the trip. Against the Hornets, he hit a pair of 3s and a floater in the third that helped push the lead to double digits and sent the Sixers on their way to a needed victory. ""The team trusts me, the coaching staff, they trust me a lot,"" Korkmaz said. ""I think I'm in good shape right now. I just feel good."" The 22-year-old Korkmaz, a first-round pick in the 2016 draft, had an uneven first two seasons in Philadelphia and played in only 62 total games. The Sixers even declined to pick up the third-year option on his contract before last season. But Korkmaz gives the Sixers a long-range threat they need and he signed a two-year deal in the offseason with the potential of more playing time ahead. ""(Coach) just told me this was all on the table,"" Korkmaz said. ""Just fight for your spot. If you make good, I will give it to you. I just came into training camp with that mindset."" Korkmaz had the play of the game on his behind-the-back pass to Raul Neto for a 3-pointer in the first half. Neto got the start because Simmons missed his second straight game because of a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. Simmons will be re-evaluated Monday. Zeller had 24 points for a Hornets team that had lost at home to New Orleans on Saturday. The Hornets hit three 3s in the final two minutes, making the rout look much more competitive than they were for most of the second half. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum sat out (middle finger). ...

""We didn't come out with that same aggressiveness to start the third quarter,"" coach James Borrego said. ""They really jumped on us, they made shots. We didn't carry that momentum from the first half into the second half."" PROTECT THE BALL The 76ers had 20 turnovers. ""We have to find a discipline and a better way to control that,"" Brown said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn't contain his frustration after a subpar first half. Somewhere between the court and the locker room, the Milwaukee Bucks star kicked -- and destroyed -- a sign with a Thunder logo that is part of a temporary barrier. The reigning league MVP regretted his actions. ""You know, there's no excuse there, and obviously I'll try to pay for the sign, or I can trade you guys for the Bucks sign when you guys come to Milwaukee,"" he said. ""But there's no excuse for that. But obviously, playing basketball is a lot of frustration and a lot of emotion, and obviously, moments like that happen."" He channeled his fire in the second half. He scored 24 of his 35 points after the break to help the Milwaukee Bucks rally and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-119 on Sunday night. His first half, by his standards, was forgettable. He scored 11 points on 4-for-8 shooting and had six rebounds. Most important, the Thunder led by six. ""I wasn't playing good basketball,"" he said. ""I wasn't being as aggressive as I wanted."" In the second half, he made 9 of 11 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds. Thunder guard Chris Paul said it's a challenge to defend a 6-foot-11 player who can drive. ""You think `back up, back up,' but by the time you keep backing up, he's at the rim,"" Paul said. Eric Bledsoe added 25 points and nine assists for the Bucks, who have won five of six.

Gallinari missed a clean look at a 3, then Milwaukee's George Hill made two free throws with 10.5 seconds left to put the Bucks in control.

"Knicks president Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry address the media to voice their displeasure after the Knicks' 108-87 loss to the Cavaliers on Nov. 10. (1:11) NEW YORK --  The Cleveland Cavaliers beat New York for their first winning streak of the season. Another loss prompted Knicks' officials to address the team's slow start. Collin Sexton scored 31 points and the Cavaliers beat the Knicks 108-87 on Sunday night. Kevin Love and Jordan Clarkson each added 17 points for Cleveland (4-5), which won two games in a row for the first time in the young season. The Cavaliers were coming off a 113-100 win over Washington on Friday. ""Right from the get-go we shared the ball, we had 20-some assists,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""We only had 12 turnovers and we forced them into 21 turnovers, and they only shot 35%. ""Both ends of the floor, I think this was one of our better performances."" The Knicks couldn't say the same. Julius Randle had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Alonzo Trier added 13 points for New York, which fell to 2-8, last in the Eastern Conference. ""Obviously, (GM) Scott (Perry) and I are not happy with where we are right now,"" Knicks President Steve Mills said following the loss. ""We think the team is not performing to the level that we anticipated or we expected to perform, and it's something that we collectively have to do a better job of delivering the product on the floor that we said we would do at the start of this season. ""We still believe in our coaching staff. We believe in the plan Scott and I put together and the players that we've assembled, but we also have to acknowledge that we haven't played at the level we expected to play at."" According to Mills, he and Knicks general manager Scott Perry spoke with owner James Dolan during the game, which included several rounds of boos from fans in attendance. ""I mean Jim still believes in the plan that we put together, but he's passionate as we are about this,"" Mills said. ""He would want us to have better results on the floor. But I think Jim is a fan and believes in what we are doing, but he has the same kind of expectations that we have. And this is really about how we feel about what we should be doing, what we should be delivering as a group and we all take responsibility."" Following Mills and Perry at the podium, coach David Fizdale was asked if he feels a sense of urgency to get the Knicks  turned around quickly. ""I live in that sense of urgency,"" Fizdale said. ""I don't need anyone to speak to give me a sense of urgency. I'm not cruising through this thing acting like I've got a bunch of time to get a team together. Every day I have urgency about this team about how I coach them, about getting them better, about building consistent habits."" Cleveland opened the second half on an 18-6 run and led the Knicks by as many as 30 in the third quarter. Following a driving layup from Sexton at the 6:48 mark of the third quarter, fans booed the Knicks heavily. The Cavaliers took a 54-36 lead into the half as Sexton led all scorers with 16 points. The Knicks struggled mightily from the field shooting 16 for 43 in the first half, taking many contested long two-pointers. Beilein had high praise for Sexton's defensive development. ""I love the way he attacks the basket, but I think what's being underrated here is his growth from last year to this year on his defense,"" the coach said. ""You can see he'll still make a mistake every now and then -- everybody does -- but for the most part, he's an athlete who should become a very good defender."" Cleveland busted out of the gate and led 14-4 as Sexton scored nine points to open the game.

"PHOENIX --  Ricky Rubio is a pass-first point guard. Sunday night, he showed he can score when the shots are there as well. Rubio had a season-high 22 points, the most he's had since February of last season with Utah, and added 12 of the Phoenix Suns' 37 assists in a 138-112 rout of the Brooklyn Nets. Devin Booker led the Suns with 27 points, shooting 10 of 14 from the field and making 4 of 5 3-pointers to go with nine assists. ""We moved the ball. We played super unselfish,"" Rubio said. ""That is super fun to play."" Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 points, rookie Cameron Johnson had a career-high 15. The Suns trailed just once, at 1-0. The Suns shot 54 percent through three quarters, hitting 16 of 34 on 3-pointers, and cruised in the final period. They won for the fourth time in five games and ended the Nets' four-game winning streak in Phoenix. Spencer Dinwiddie led the Nets with 18 points. Kyrie Irving finished with 15 points on 7-of-16 shooting. ""I don't think I shot one free throw, which is a tell-tale sign of just how aggressive I am not in the game,"" Irving said. ""A lot of the accountability falls on me and really the game plan of guarding Ricky and not being in the right spots."" The Suns made 10 of their first 11 shots, including 4 of 5 3-pointers. Phoenix led by 20 points in the quarter. Center Aaron Baynes hit two 3s inside the first 3 minutes and had two dunks. The flustered Nets trailed by 19 points, 32-13, with 4:35 left in the first quarter, having turned the ball over five times and been whistled for six fouls. Coach Kenny Atkinson was called for a technical foul for going out on the court to vent at the officials. That seemed to stir the Nets, who cut it to 37-30 by the end of the quarter. The Nets made it 42-40 on the third of Garrett Temple's three 3s off the bench as the Suns cooled off until the last half of the second quarter. Up only two, 46-44 at the 6-minute mark, Phoenix finished the quarter on a 22-6 run for a lead. Oubre capped it off with a 3 from the top of the arc at the buzzer -- part of his 16 points in the half -- then jogged off the court with his arms raised. ""We came out connecting on all cylinders,"" Oubre said. ""We move it around, it doesn't matter who scores as long as everybody touches it. ""Nights like this, it's scary,"" he added. The Suns built on their lead in the third. Dario Saric knocked down a 3 with 6:32 to make it 85-59, and went up 102-73 on Booker's 31-foot 3-pointer at the 2:06 mark. ""What's not to like?"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""It was a big-time effort on our part to do what we do, share the ball. I thought Ricky set the tone."" OUBRE PUMPS UP Oubre, known for his energetic style of play, got the home crowd going after he took a hard foul from Jordan with 58 seconds to play in the first half and tumbled to the floor. Instead of getting up immediately, he did a couple of push-ups, then walked to the free throw line and made both shots. SEVEN FOR 3 Sunday was the first game in Suns history where seven different players made two or more 3-pointers, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. That included all five starters.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard huddled with the Trail Blazers after regulation against Atlanta, searching for overtime motivation after a four-game losing streak. ""I just turned to the group and I told them that, sometimes when you're struggling and having a hard time like we have, you get put in these types of situations, where you've got to see how bad you want it,"" Lillard said. ""You've got to dig out and do it as a group."" The Blazers proved they indeed wanted it in the end, snapping the losing streak with a 124-113 overtime victory over the Hawks on Sunday night. Lillard finished with 30 points. Kent Bazemore made back-to-back 3-pointers to open the extra period, sending the Blazers to their first win at home this season. Trae Young had 35 points and 10 assists for Atlanta, which has lost three straight games and six of its last seven. It was a tight game throughout, but especially heated in the final moments of regulation as both teams wrestled for the win. With a 103-102 edge, Blazers coach Terry Stotts challenged a foul call on Hassan Whiteside with 1:09 left. It was successful and CJ McCollum's jumper extended the lead to 105-102 with 52.5 seconds left. Kevin Huerter's 3-pointer for Atlanta tied it at 105 with 27.9 seconds to go. Lillard answered with a layup that gave Portland back the lead but Huerter's layup tied it up again with 0.7 seconds on the clock, sending the game to overtime. After Bazemore's 3-pointers against his former team, McCollum's 3 extended the lead to 118-111 to all but seal it. McCollum finished with 23 points and Whiteside added 21 points and 11 rebounds. ""They started out every quarter on a run and the same thing happened at the end. They started out on a run and it was too late then to catch back up,"" Young said. The Blazers were coming off a 119-115 loss to the Nets on Friday night, which marred Lillard's big night with a personal best and franchise record 60 points. Portland has been beset by injuries. Forward Zach Collins appeared in three games this season before surgery on his shoulder that will sideline him at least four months. Forward Rodney Hood left Friday's game with back spasms and was unavailable against the Hawks. But the Blazers saw the return of Skal Labissiere, who sprained his ankle in the fourth quarter against the Nets.  And Whiteside, who was day-to-day with a right foot sprain, started. ""We needed it,"" Stotts said about the victory. ""No matter how we got it, we got it."" The Hawks were coming off to a 121-109 loss at home to Sacramento Kings 121-109 on Friday night. Atlanta is also dealing with injuries: Evan Turner, a former Blazer, missed his sixth game with an Achilles issue while Allen Crabbe remained out after knee surgery last April. Crabbe, upgraded to questionable before the game, was dressed but did not play. Lloyd Pierce started Huerter instead of Cam Reddish, who had started the Hawks' previous eight games. ""The home team came up big in the fourth quarter so credit to them but I thought our guys played their tails off tonight,"" Pierce said. Whiteside's dunk put the Blazers up 18-10 early but by the end of the first period the Hawks closed the gap and went up 21-20 after Young's basket. Portland reclaimed the lead, going up 40-33 on Gary Trent Jr.'s jumper. Atlanta closed to within 46-44 at the half. Anthony Tolliver's layup for Portland tied the game at 73 late in the third period. Anfernee Simons, who had 12 points in the third quarter alone, pulled Portland in front 78-75 with a driving layup and free throw in the fourth. Lillard's step-back 3-pointer and layup gave Portland an 85-82 advantage, but Parker's jumper narrowed the gap for the Hawks. Parker finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds for Atlanta. TIP INS: Hawks: The game was the first of a five-game trip. ... Vince Carter was not with the team because of personal reasons. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Pascal Siakam had 24 points and 11 rebounds, Fred VanVleet finished with 23 points and 10 assists and the Toronto Raptors snapped the Los Angeles Lakers' seven-game winning streak with a 113-104 victory Sunday night. Chris Boucher matched his career high with 15 points for the Raptors, who have won three straight and six of seven. The defending NBA champions played without two key regulars after losing starter Kyle Lowry to a broken left thumb and top reserve Serge Ibaka to a sprained right ankle, but Toronto still rallied in the fourth quarter and hung on late for its 10th consecutive win over the Lakers. Anthony Davis scored 27 points and LeBron James had 13 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds in his 85th career triple-double, but the Lakers lost for the first time since opening night against the Clippers. Toronto led 104-92 with 3:50 to play on Terence Davis' third 3-pointer after a rally by four reserves and Siakam, but Kyle Kuzma hit back-to-back 3-pointers while LA scored eight straight points. The Lakers then missed four consecutive 3-pointers with the chance to pull even, and Siakam threw down back-to-back dunks on the fast break to seal it. Norman Powell scored 14 points while starting in Lowry's spot for Toronto. Davis and James both had big games, but the Lakers' supporting cast wasn't helpful and their team defense didn't look nearly as sharp as it had been in recent games. Kuzma scored 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Danny Green went scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting in 27 minutes for the Lakers, who signed him to a two-year free agent deal in the summer. The sharpshooting veteran won a ring with the Raptors last year while shooting a career-high 45.5% on 3-pointers during his sole season in Toronto. Siakam got off to a 3-for-15 start from the field, preventing him from matching his 44-point effort at New Orleans two nights ago. But he excelled in the second half, particularly in a lineup including four reserves as Toronto jumped to its first double-digit lead of the night early in the fourth quarter. Toronto opened the fourth with a 17-6 run led by nine points from Boucher, the undrafted Canadian who was on the last two teams to win the NBA title.

"DETROIT --  The Minnesota Timberwolves shot an abysmal 6 of 45 from 3-point range in a loss to Denver over the weekend. That evened out in a hurry against Detroit. Andrew Wiggins scored 33 points, and Minnesota spoiled Blake Griffin's return Monday night, beating the Pistons 120-114. The Timberwolves shot 8 of 10 from beyond the arc in the first quarter to take a 15-point lead, and they held Detroit at bay after that. ""We talked this morning -- how we made sure there weren't any lids on the basket,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""They deserve a win like this on a back-to-back."" Griffin played for the first time this season, coming back from hamstring and knee issues. Derrick Rose also returned to the Detroit lineup from a strained hamstring, but both he and Griffin played limited minutes. Griffin scored 19 points but Rose added just six. ""We've just got to ask the question: Do we want to win -- are we going to come out and play hard, or going to get spanked like this every night?"" Rose said. ""We need everybody to be on the same page. We need everybody to move in a collective group. We've got to figure it out."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 25 points for Minnesota, which snapped an eight-game losing streak to the Pistons. After a 100-98 overtime loss to Denver on Sunday, Minnesota was sharp at the start of this game. The Timberwolves led 41-26 after one, and the Pistons never cut too far into the deficit until the fourth. A 3-pointer by Detroit's Tony Snell made it 109-104, but Towns drew a double team at the other end and passed to an open Wiggins, whose 3-pointer restored the lead to eight. ""Every good thing that happens to Andrew, Andrew deserves, because Andrew does work hard,"" Saunders said. ""He had a different mindset this summer. We had a conversation, so all the credit goes to him for buying in and really delivering for us."" Minnesota led by 19 in the third before the Pistons ran off eight points in a row. Towns ended that quarter with a driving dunk that put the Timberwolves ahead 92-81. Minnesota was without point guard Jeff Teague (illness). Luke Kennard led Detroit with 25 points, and Snell scored 16. Andre Drummond had 11 points and 12 rebounds, but he went just 4 of 12 from the field. MANAGING MINUTES Griffin played 23:58 and Rose only 19:54. Coach Dwane Casey acknowledged it was hard getting them on the court for significant time together. ""Believe me, it's a trigonometry lesson,"" Casey said. ""I know it's for their health and all that stuff, but it's difficult. It's difficult for the team and it's difficult for their teammates to come in and get a good rhythm, but somehow, someway we have to get a rhythm if that is who we are going to be."" Griffin said the chemistry between him and Rose -- a new acquisition this season -- should be OK. ""He's a great player. Players like that are easy to play with,"" Griffin said. ""Some nights it might be his night. Some nights it might be mine. Some nights it might be neither, but we'll be able to affect the game whether we're scoring the basketball or not."" SHARP SHOOTING Each team had a reserve shooting well. Minnesota's Jake Layman made four 3-pointers and scored 16 points. Detroit's Langston Galloway made four 3s of his own and finished with 18 points. ""I feel like I have been getting great shots every game,"" Layman said. ""Some games they haven't been falling, but it's all great looks all around our offense. So, I'm going to keep doing the same thing."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without G Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain). ... The Timberwolves finished 15 of 34 from 3-point range. Pistons: G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction) did not play.","401160782"
"Luka Doncic hits the crowd with a Michael Jordan-like shrug after draining a deep 3-pointer. (0:25) BOSTON --  Kemba Walker took on some extra responsibility at the offensive end in Boston's first game since Gordon Hayward broke his left hand. Walker made a trio of key 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and finished with 29 points, Jaylen Brown added 25 points and 11 rebounds, and the Celtics beat the Dallas Mavericks 116-106 Monday night. ""I was just trying to be aggressive, trying to make the right plays,"" Walker said. ""My shot felt good the whole night. I was just missing them. Then, in the fourth quarter, just naturally, the competitive nature just comes out and I try to do what I can do to put the ball in the basket."" Marcus Smart scored 17 points, Daniel Theis chipped in with 11 and Brad Wanamaker had 10 for Boston, which won its eighth straight game since a season-opening loss at Philadelphia. Jayson Tatum shot 1 for 18 from the field and scored only five points for the Celtics. Luka Doncic led the Mavericks (6-4) with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Maxi Kleber had 15 points with eight boards. Kristaps Porzingis scored just four points on 1-of-11 shooting for Dallas. ""Porzingis had a tough night. We're just going to flush it and move on,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said with a laugh. ""You know, there's nights like this. You've just got to flush it and move forward."" Porzingis took a lot of blame for the loss. ""I had an off night tonight, and guys stepped up,"" he said. ""Guys fought until the end, and we were right there. If I had a better game, the result could have been much different."" The Celtics released a statement during the opening quarter that said Hayward had surgery Monday to repair a fracture in his non-shooting hand. He was injured during their previous game in San Antonio when he collided with LaMarcus Aldridge as the Spurs' big man set a screen. ""I got word at halftime that surgery went well,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""We're going to have to find other guys to step up, especially off the bench."" Boston trailed by two before going on an 11-2 spurt over a 1:32 stretch to move ahead 101-94 with 4:11 to play on Walker's 3 from the right wing. Smart then converted a three-point play. Walker nailed his three big shots from beyond the arc in a span of 1:09. Dallas took its first lead, 88-86, on Tim Hardaway Jr.'s one-handed runner in the lane. The Mavericks held a 92-90 edge before Walker took over. The teams were tied at halftime before Boston opened the second half with a 15-3 surge. Smart started the run with a 3 from the right corner. Walker and Brown added 3s on consecutive possessions. Doncic then started to take over, scoring nine of the Mavericks' 11 points as they closed to 84-79 at the end of the third quarter. TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis didn't play in Dallas' previous game, resting as he returns from left knee surgery that sidelined him for the entire 2018-19 season. ""He was (struggling), but you know this is what happens to great players,"" Doncic said. ""They have a bad night. So expect, I think, the next game he's going to have at least 30 points. He keeps working. He just came back from injury."" Celtics: C Enes Kanter returned after missing seven games with a bruised left knee. ""I felt it a little bit,"" he said when asked if he was fatigued during his nearly six minutes in the game. . Theis injured his right pinkie and went to the locker room early in the game. He came back to the bench and had the pinkie taped to his ring finger before going back in.

"NEW ORLEANS --  As usual, scoring comes in concentrated bursts for James Harden. Harden scored 19 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter and the Houston Rockets beat the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 122-116 Monday night. The NBA's leading scorer has averaged 40.6 points in his last eight games, but missed nine of his first 10 3-point shots. Still, with Houston leading by four midway through the fourth quarter, Harden lit his personal fuse and scored 13 consecutive points in a 1:57 span to push the advantage to 110-93. ""I wasn't really getting to the rim,"" Harden said. ""The first three quarters I was settling and kind of just being passive. So, I just wanted to be more aggressive, whether it was shooting my shot or getting to the basket."" Russell Westbrook had 26 points and Clint Capela added 11 points and 20 rebounds to help the Rockets to their fourth straight win. JJ Redick had 24 points, Josh Hart scored 19, and Jrue Holiday added 18 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds for New Orleans, which played without leading-scorer Brandon Ingram due to a sore right knee. The Pelicans could not overcome 12 first-half turnovers -- six by Holiday in the first half alone -- and 29% shooting from 3-point range in the fourth quarter. ""We've just got to start valuing the basketball and we've got to stop making the bad turnover,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You shoot 45 threes -- you've got to make more than 14 of them."" The Rockets led 95-82 early in the fourth quarter on Westbrook's dunk, but the Pelicans pulled to 97-93 on a four-point play by Redick. Harden then took control with his scoring burst. ""It's go time,"" Harden said. ""The fourth quarter is winning time, so you've got to be more aggressive and make plays whenever they come to you, whether it's my shot or getting to the basket, shooting my floater or making the right play."" He started the run by splitting defenders for driving layups on consecutive possessions and then made back-to-back 3-pointers, including one for a four-point play. By the time Harden made two free throws to end the run, Houston led by 17 with 5:20 left. ""It's what he does,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It shouldn't have been (just a four-point lead). We have to close games out. We have to play better. We have to play smart, and tonight I didn't think we did. Good enough to win? OK, but that's not what we want to be."" The Rockets committed 17 turnovers and shot just 29.3% from the perimeter (12 of 41). Harden and Westbrook missing 14 of their first 16 attempts on 3-pointers, and finished a combined 4 for 19 from long range. But they did enough with mid-range jumpers and layups. The Rockets built a 42-31 lead midway through the second quarter, but the Pelicans used an 18-9 run, with eight points coming from Hart, to trim the deficit to 51-49. Despite shooting just 4 for 19 from 3-point range, Houston led 58-52 at the half. Harden struggled early from long range, missing his first four shots. The Pelicans stayed within striking distance on the strength of Redick's 3-point shooting (4 of 6) for 12 first-half points. Harden's first 3 of the game put Houston up 68-57, but New Orleans went on a 17-7 spurt, with seven points by E'Twaun Moore, to cut it to 75-74. The Rockets closed the quarter by outscoring the Pelicans 15-8 to lead 90-82 after three.

""Russell is an MVP for a reason,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's one of the best players in the league. You have to let him go. He'll figure it out."" MIXED BAGGAGE In addition to his near triple-double and six turnovers, Holiday shot 0 for 7 on 3-pointers. ""Just keep pushing,"" he said. ""I feel that everybody just goes through slumps. Not shooting efficiently, missing easy buckets to the rim, my 3-point shot not falling. . I can produce in other ways.""","401160784"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Jaren Jackson Jr.'s inconsistency has mirrored that of the Memphis Grizzlies. Jackson put together his best all-around performance Monday night and it resulted in Memphis' most satisfying victory and first road win. Jackson had 24 points and the Grizzlies put a damper on Tony Parker's jersey retirement by beating the San Antonio Spurs 113-109 Monday night. After averaging 44 points and committing 14 fouls in his previous four games, Jackson had six rebounds, five assists, one block and just two personal fouls in 38 minutes against the Spurs. ""He's getting comfortable, his confidence is back,"" Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant said. ""He's just playing with that bop, not thinking too much. We're going to tell him to just hoop."" Jackson was involved in two pivotal plays with the Grizzlies up 111-109 in the final minute. His 3-pointer with 25.5 seconds was overturned when replays determined the Grizzlies forward was out of bounds. Jackson then blocked DeMar DeRozan's ensuing drive to maintain Memphis' two-point advantage. Memphis won a coach's challenge that overturned a foul that would have put DeRozan on the line with San Antonio trailing 113-109. Dillon Brooks had 21 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 18 points and 12 rebounds for Memphis, which had lost two straight and five of six. ""I'm proud of them,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We've tried to address the last couple of days that's not our standard. How we've got to compete the right way, play together the right way and this is what we're capable of."" San Antonio needed a fevered comeback to overcome another sluggish performance on the heels of a 135-115 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday. It was a strange performance given the circumstances. Parker's uniform was lifted to the rafters alongside fellow Big Three members Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili following the game. That group led San Antonio to four of its five championships and have the most wins (541) of any trio in league history. That success seems like a distant memory as the Spurs (5-5) suffered their second straight loss and fourth defeat in five games. The sold-out crowd came in buzzing, but the Spurs didn't give them much to cheer for. San Antonio shot 33 percent in falling behind 35-22 in the first quarter. ""We've got to show some type of urgency, understanding,"" DeRozan said. ""We can't wait until late in the game to try to make something happen, try to make a defensive play. We've got to be consistent from the beginning of the game."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 19 points, Rudy Gay added 18 and DeRozan had 12 for San Antonio. Memphis took advantage, attacking the basket continually in building a 16-point lead in the first half behind 22 points in the paint and 51% shooting. WELCOME HOME The Spurs welcomed back former players Ginobili, Boris Diaw, Michael Finley, Ian Mahinmi and former assistants Mike Budenholzer, Ime Udoka and James Borrego for Parker's jersey retirement along with Parker's former France National Team members Nicolas Batum and Ronny Turiaf. A few bats crashed the party, buzzing the court minutes prior to and during Parker's retirement ceremony. Two stadium workers attempted to corral them with nets but the crowd chanted, ""Manu"" in hopes Ginobili would repeat his 2017 performance when he swatted one down. Ginobili rolled up his sleeves and feigned getting up but instead laughed and remained seated as the bats flew up to the rafters. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Former Spurs forward Kyle Anderson had three points, three rebounds and two assists in 18 minutes off the bench. ... Memphis is 39-8 against the Spurs in San Antonio. Spurs: Derrick White continued to ride a stationary bike to stay loose when he wasn't in the game. White is still feeling the effects of hard fall on his backside against the Lakers on Nov. 3. ... In addition to their Big Three, the Spurs have retired the jerseys of James Silas, George Gervin, Johnny Moore, David Robinson, Sean Elliott, Avery Johnson and Bruce Bowen.","401160785"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz showed they can be a dangerous team from beyond the arc. Mitchell and Mike Conley each hit five 3-pointers as the Jazz shot 56 percent (15 for 27) from deep over the first three quarters to take command in a 122-108 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Utah entered averaging 29.3 attempts per game from 3-point range, fifth-fewest in the NBA. ""We're a team that we want to be able to shoot 3s and make 3s at a high clip,"" Conley said. ""We've got a lot of guys who can do it."" Rudy Gobert had 25 points and 14 rebounds to power the Jazz inside, but it was their perimeter shooting that made the difference every time the Warriors threatened a comeback. Mitchell added 23 points and Conley scored 22 for Utah, which improved to 7-3. The injury-ravaged Warriors fell to an NBA-worst 2-9, and their frustrations boiled over in the fourth quarter. Draymond Green, back after missing five games with a torn finger ligament, earned back-to-back technicals and an ejection for arguing a blocking call with 8:28 left. ""I disagreed with that call, and I'm never going to be OK with another grown man telling me don't talk,"" Green said. ""If you feel like you got the call wrong, or right, you don't tell me not to talk. I'm a grown man."" Less than a minute later, coach Steve Kerr was given a technical after arguing a kicked-ball call against Jordan Poole. It's been that kind of season so far for the Warriors, who had their biggest star back in the building Monday. Stephen Curry, sidelined for at least the next three months because of a broken left hand, held a pregame media briefing to discuss his injury and try to lend his teammates some moral support. Point guard D'Angelo Russell continues to be a bright spot for Golden State. He scored 33 points, his fourth consecutive game of 30 or more. Green pointed out it's a different offense the Warriors are running than before he was injured. With Curry out, Kerr is putting the ball in Russell's hands, which means more pick-and-rolls and less rapid-fire passing. ""I don't really have the ball in my hands. I've always been a playmaker. I don't really have the ball much,"" Green said. ""It's just (something) to figure out. It's not the first time in my career I've had to figure something out."" Kerr agreed it's an adjustment for Green, whose slick passing always has been a staple of the Warriors' offense. ""It's kind of a strange case where the guy who's been here the longest is the newest with what we're doing,"" Kerr said. TIP-INS Jazz: Entered the night with the NBA's 28th-ranked offense at 101 points per game. ... Finished 16 for 35 (46 percent) from 3-point range and went 26 of 32 at the foul line. ... Utah, which is 5-0 at home, improved to 2/3 on the road. Warriors: Green's return to the lineup was a welcome sign, but his presence was felt even before the opening tip. ""We already felt it this morning in shootaround, just his voice,"" Kerr said. ... Golden State also welcomed back rookie forward Eric Paschall, who missed Saturday's game at Oklahoma City with a bruised hip. Paschall, who averaged 22.5 points in the four games leading up to his injury, finished with eight. JERSEY EXCHANGE Paschall and Mitchell, AAU teammates in Harlem, New York, during their younger days, exchanged jerseys after the game. ""I'll probably hang it up,"" Paschall said. ""Just to be able to switch jerseys with him is so special. I know our families are very happy and very blessed that we're in a position to do this."" KERR REFLECTS Kerr began his pregame media briefing by sending condolences to the family of Bernard Tyson, the CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente who died Sunday at age 60. ""He was a wonderful man, someone who made a huge impact here in the Bay Area, the community and with our team,"" Kerr said.","401160786"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard wasn't at his best against his former team. His new teammates knocked down big shots and won anyway. Leonard struggled on 2-for-11 shooting and had nine turnovers, but Lou Williams led a big effort from the bench with 21 points and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors 98-88 on Monday night. Leonard finished with 12 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists to go with those nine turnovers, prompting Clippers coach Doc Rivers to joke about ""almost a quadruple-double."" Throughout the game, Leonard faced plenty of double coverage. ""As soon as I walked across half-court they tried to get the ball out of my hands,"" he said. ""They did a great job on me defending and sending an extra body. It got me better and it's going to get my teammates better."" Last season, Leonard led the Raptors to their first championship, averaging 30.5 points and 9.1 rebounds in 24 postseason games to earn his second Finals MVP award. ""I had a great time there. It's the next chapter now. I can't live in the past,"" he said. ""I'm with a different team and they want to have that same feeling."" The Clippers shot just 37% but dominated the boards 66-38, led by 12 each from Patrick Beverley and JaMychal Green. Los Angeles' bench outscored Toronto's reserves 56-35, with Montrezl Harrell adding 14 points and 11 rebounds and Green posting 10 points and 12 rebounds. Leonard's first five points all came on free throws, including two technicals. He missed his first six field goal attempts and finally scored on a coast-to-coast layup midway through the third quarter to put the Clippers up 62-55. From there, the Raptors outscored Los Angles 23-11 the rest of the period. Pascal Siakam had seven points and Fred VanVleet added five in the spurt as neither team led by more than two until Matt Thomas' 3-pointer and basket sent the Raptors into the fourth leading 78-73. ""It's just fun, just be able to compete against guys who you were with last year,"" Leonard said. ""It's a little bit more competitive because you do talk to them."" Not much, though. ""Maybe whispered a little bit to him here or there about missing a free throw,"" Fred VanVleet said, ""but it didn't work."" Siakam had 16 points and 10 rebounds, Norman Powell added 15 points and VanVleet had 14 points for the injury-depleted Raptors, who had their three-game winning streak snapped in the second game of a back-to-back after beating the Lakers on Sunday. ""That's a hell of a team to play on a back-to-back short-handed,"" VanVleet said. ""Just kind of ran ourselves into the mud and give those guys credit, they closed it out."" VanVleet was 1 for 7 in the fourth after notching three double-doubles in his previous five games. Toronto was 4 of 24 from the floor in a fourth quarter that featured a series of mad dashes and bodies piled in the paint on both ends. The Raptors tied the game for the last time at 82 on Chris Boucher's 3-pointer. They managed just three field goals the rest of the way. ""Our guys played their guts out. We totally outplayed them,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We were playing harder, executing better, creating a lot of problems for them but just not quite enough."" IN YOUR EYE Raptors starting forward OG Anunoby got poked in the right eye by Leonard while scrambling for a rebound two minutes into the game and didn't return. Anunoby's eye was patched after the game and he'll see a doctor on Tuesday. Nurse was asked about Anunoby getting called for a foul on the play. ""The guy lost both his contacts and cut his eye open with blood,"" he said. ""Are you kidding me?"" Leonard said he would text Anunoby to see how he's doing. HE SAID IT ""I could complain about officiating if you guys want to pitch into the fine pool."" -- VanVleet to reporters. TIP-INS Raptors: They were without G Kyle Lowry (broken left thumb) and F/C Serge Ibaka (right ankle sprain), who both got hurt Friday at New Orleans. Lowry will be re-evaluated in two weeks, while Ibaka is out indefinitely. Clippers: Starting G Landry Shamet went down near the baseline late in the third and had to be helped off the court after spraining his ankle. He was on crutches afterward. ... Los Angeles improved to 6-1 at home. HONORING GEORGE Paul George had his No. 24 jersey retired at Fresno State, where Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and some of his current teammates surprised him. George was honored at halftime of Sunday's 77-74 victory over Winthrop in front of 8,529 fans. He and former Bulldogs coach Jerry Tarkanian are the only basketball jerseys to be retired by the school, where George played from 2008-10 before leaving early for the NBA draft.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  T.J. Warren was in attack mode to start the second half. Warren scored 11 of his 23 points in the third quarter to lead the Indiana Pacers over the Oklahoma City Thunder 111-85 Tuesday night. ""I just wanted to come out with a high sense of urgency out there,"" he said. ""I know we had a good little lead and we just wanted to put them away in the third. I just wanted to be aggressive and attack."" Malcolm Brogdon had 20 points, six rebounds and five assists, and Domantas Sabonis had 18 points and 16 rebounds for the surging Pacers (7-4), who have won seven of eight, including four straight. It was Warren who provided the spark needed to put the game out of reach, shooting 5 for 5 from the field in the third quarter and 10 for 14 overall. As one of nine additions to Indiana's roster this season, Warren is beginning to find a groove. ""It's a new group,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Part of it is figuring these guys out, where they like the ball, what they can do with the basketball. We're starting to personalize some of the sets in the offense, spotting where guys can be effective and productive."" The Pacers used a big third quarter -- including 71.4 percent shooting -- to take a 26-point lead and put the game away. Aaron Holiday hit two 3-pointers and Warren made another in a 15-2 run that ended with Doug McDermott's layup to put Indiana ahead 84-58 with 1:49 to go. McDermott hit a 3-pointer to make it 99-68 with 7:19 to play. Danilo Gallinari scored 14 points, Deonte Burton had 13 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 11 points and six rebounds for the Thunder (4-7), who have lost three of four and remained winless on the road. ""We definitely struggled on offense,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""It was 10 at the half and we talked about that coming out of the half. Warren really got going in that stretch and then their whole team kind of got going."" The Pacers first pulled away with a 12-2 run in the first quarter. TJ Leaf's layup gave Indiana a 28-18 lead, and the Pacers led by 15 after a jumper by Brogdon made it 52-37 with 1:58 remaining in the half. The Thunder scored five straight points, including a 3-pointer by Gilgeous-Alexander, to close out the first half. The Pacers led 52-42 at halftime. SUCCESS AT THE LINE The Pacers were 10 for 10 from the foul line through the first three quarters and finished 12 for 13 overall. The Thunder were 19 for 20 after three quarters, finishing 21 for 24 from the line. Gallinari shot a perfect 8 for 8 on free throws. OLADIPO PROGRESSING IN REHAB Victor Oladipo was assigned to Indiana's G League affiliate in Fort Wayne for a brief period Tuesday. The two-time All-Star was then recalled following a practice with the Mad Ants in Indianapolis, where Oladipo participated in full court drills for the first time, according to McMillan.

"PHILADELPHIA --  The shots weren't falling for the Philadelphia 76ers, so they clamped down on defense. Joel Embiid scored 27 points, including the go-ahead dunk with 13.2 seconds remaining, and Philadelphia held Cleveland without a point for the final 3  1/2 minutes in a 98-97 win over the Cavaliers on Tuesday night. Josh Richardson added 17 points and Ben Simmons had 15 for Philadelphia, which won despite missing 30 of 38 3-point attempts. Tobias Harris missed all 11 of his 3-point tries. ""You better guard if you're not going to make shots,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We knew if we were going to do anything, we had to play defense -- and defense we played."" Jordan Clarkson and Kevin Love each had 20 points to pace Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 18 points and Tristan Thompson had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers trailed for most of the contest, but took advantage of Philadelphia's poor shooting in the fourth quarter, going up by as many as five points on three occasions. ""We gave them life and were in a fistfight,"" Brown said. ""You can just feel it. We had a chance to discourage them and we didn't. Certainly a hard-fought game and we're lucky to get away with it."" Cleveland led 97-92 with 3:34 remaining after Sexton's driving layup, but the Cavaliers wouldn't score again. Harris pulled Philadelphia within 97-94 with a follow layup and then hit a 17-footer on the ensuing possession to make it a one-point game with 1:42 left. Cleveland had chances to build the lead after that, but Love missed a close-range shot before a shot-clock violation on the Cavaliers' next possession. ""I think our defense was pretty OK,"" Embiid said. ""We just didn't make shots."" The 76ers were having their own trouble scoring with Richardson and Embiid failing to convert on consecutive possessions. After a timeout with 26.6 seconds left, Brown called a high-percentage play with Harris finding Embiid close to the basket. Embiid slammed it home to give the 76ers their first lead, 98-97, since early in the fourth quarter. ""It was a great play-call by coach and we did the rest,"" Embiid said. Cleveland had a chance to win it, but Love's 3-point attempt from the top of the key rimmed out. ""Kevin is a great shooter, not a good shooter,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""He took his time but just didn't nail it. It's one of many looks I'll take at that time."" CLOSE CALLS Four of Philadelphia's seven wins have been by eight points or less. Asked if the 76ers were playing with fire by winning such close games, Brown said, ""It's a blow torch. It is violent."" ""I, sadistically, love it,"" he added. BEN'S BACK Simmons returned after missing two games due to a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. He added six assists, five rebounds and two blocks to his point total, but also had four turnovers in 35 minutes. He made 7 of 9 field goals with all but a 6-foot turnaround jumper from close range. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Porter Jr. returned in the second half after appearing to injure his hip early in the second quarter. Porter finished with four points. . John Henson (hamstring) and Ante Zizic (foot) sat out. 76ers: Al Horford (rest), Shake Milton (knee) and Trey Burke (left calf) didn't play. . Philadelphia missed its first eight 3-pointers before Embiid connected from long range with 1:49 left in the first quarter. The 76ers finished the first period 1 for 11 from the arc, with Harris missing all five of his 3-point attempts. . The 76ers finished the first half going 3 for 20 from 3-point range, but led 54-48.","401160789"
"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler knows this Miami Heat team can get much better. That being said, he's quite happy with the start. Butler scored 11 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, added 13 assists and the Miami Heat wasted most of what was a 29-point lead before hanging on to beat the shorthanded Detroit Pistons 117-108 on Tuesday night. ""We want it to be tough to come here and play,"" Butler said. ""We don't want people to come here and want to play the Miami Heat. We don't want people to want to play the Miami Heat, home or away."" Kendrick Nunn also had 20 for Miami, while Bam Adebayo scored 18 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the Heat. Goran Dragic also had 18 points for the Heat (7-3), who matched the third-best 10-game start in Heat history. Butler's 13-assist, zero-turnover game was the fifth in Heat history and the first since Dwyane Wade had one in 2009. Luke Kennard was 0 for 7 in the first half, but recovered to score 22 for Detroit. Andre Drummond had 16 points and nine rebounds before fouling out, and Christian Wood added 16 for the Pistons -- who never led, but made the second half plenty interesting by getting as close as seven late. ""NBA basketball games are long,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And you have to play all the way through to the end. ... But these are good experiences for our team."" Detroit held Blake Griffin (hamstring, knee) and Derrick Rose (hamstring) out, not wanting to play either on a back-to-back after both played Monday. That wasn't the Pistons' only issue. Record snow -- Detroit's biggest November storm ever, according to the National Weather Service, with 9.2 inches as the official mark and some suburbs reporting more than a foot -- made just getting to Miami a problem for the Pistons, who played Monday night at home and then were hoping to be airborne sometime in the 11 p.m. hour. The Pistons didn't leave their airport gate in Detroit until 2:40 a.m., got in the air 10 minutes later and were at their gate at Miami International Airport at 5:34 a.m. That was more than four hours behind their intended schedule. ""Whether we got in at 11 o'clock last night or 5 o'clock this morning, we've got to have that type of toughness and that type of resilience versus adversity that we haven't exhibited so far this year,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. He saw plenty of that. Detroit got down by as many as 29 in the first half, going into the break trailing 59-37. The Pistons got it down to 13 in the third, only to see Miami push the margin back out to 20 entering the fourth. Miami's lead was 15 when Drummond fouled out early in the fourth and it still wasn't over. Kennard made a 3-pointer with about 2 minutes left to get the Pistons within 111-103, but the Heat escaped. ""They came out ready to go from the jump and we were relaxing and let them punch us in the face,"" Pistons guard Bruce Brown said. TIP-INS Pistons: The 22-point halftime deficit was the second-largest Detroit has ever faced against Miami. The Pistons trailed the Heat 59-36 at the break of a game in 2012. .. Detroit came into the night shooting a league-best 41% from 3-point range. The Pistons shot 15 of 41 from deep on Tuesday. Heat: The 1999-2000 and 2011-12 Heat teams were 8-2. There have been eight others to start 7-3, the most recent before now being 2013-14. ... Meyers Leonard has started all 10 games this season, the first time he's had that long a starting streak in his career.

Miami was without Justise Winslow (concussion), James Johnson (sick), Tyler Herro (ankle), Derrick Jones Jr. (hip), KZ Okpala (Achilles) and Dion Waiters (suspended). HOME COOKING The Heat are 4-0 at home for the first time since 2012-13. They haven't trailed at home at any point in their last 11-1/2 quarters, going back to a 10-9 deficit against Atlanta -- a total of 136 minutes, 9 seconds.","401160790"
"CHICAGO --  Coby White waited as Roy Williams walked up the court. Williams playfully bowed in front of his former guard and then gave him a hug before taking off. It was White's night, and a beaming Williams loved every moment. White made a franchise-record seven 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, and the Chicago Bulls pulled away from the slumping New York Knicks for a 120-102 victory Tuesday. ""I had been shooting it bad, so it was good to see that first one fall,"" White said. ""Then I just got into a good rhythm."" No kidding. White missed his first five shots from the field and began the final period with just four points. But the 19-year-old rookie put on a dazzling show down the stretch, delighting a United Center crowd that included Williams, White's coach at the University of North Carolina. White and Williams talked before the win. White had been struggling with his shot, and Williams told him to just be himself. ""Just told me if I be Coby, then everything will take care of itself,"" White said. Worked out quite well for the Bulls. White connected from deep on three straight Chicago possessions during a 24-2 run that made it 109-89 with 5:51 remaining. Backed by chants of ""Co-by! Co-by!"" he made one last 3 to run the Bulls' lead out to 120-100 before checking out with 1:31 to go. ""The kid is just a super talent,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""He's got incredible speed, so you have respect it. Once he gets it going, it's hard to stop. He just broke the game open."" White finished with 27 points. Zach LaVine had 25 for Chicago, and Wendell Carter Jr. finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds. New York lost for the sixth time in seven games. Marcus Morris scored 22 points for the Knicks, and rookie RJ Barrett finished with 21 points and nine assists. ""This one was tough,"" Barrett said. ""When a guy hits seven 3s in the fourth quarter, it's kind of tough. But we played three great quarters of basketball and we've just got to finish it off in the fourth."" Barrett played his college ball at Duke, where he faced White in Atlantic Coast Conference action. ""I've seen that before,"" he said. ""He's gonna make shots, he makes tough shots. That's the kind of player he is."" It was New York's first game since team president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry expressed concern about the Knicks' level of play following an embarrassing 108-87 home loss against Cleveland on Sunday night. New York rallied for a 105-98 victory over Chicago in their first meeting of the season on Oct. 28. Bobby Portis led the way with 28 points and 11 rebounds against his former team, but he finished with just seven points in the rematch. WORTH WATCHING Chicago's Lauri Markkanen is playing with a sore oblique, but coach Jim Boylen said the third-year power forward insists it's not limiting his play on offense. The 22-year-old Markkanen was shooting just 38.5% from the field heading into the matchup with the Knicks. ""He's trying to play through whatever he has and not use it as an excuse,"" Boylen said. ""I think that's big time and I think that's what we need."" TIP-INS Knicks: Taj Gibson and Julius Randle each scored 17 points. ...

"DENVER --  Falling into a 12-0 hole less than three minutes in brought back unpleasant memories for the Atlanta Hawks. Trae Young rewrote the ending with another big game. The second-year point guard scored 15 of his season-high 42 points in the fourth quarter and added 11 assists to lead Atlanta over the Denver Nuggets 125-121 on Tuesday night. Young finished seven points shy of his career high set March 1 against Chicago last season. He was 13 of 21 from the field and finished 8 for 13 on 3-pointers to flip the script on the Hawks' last visit to Denver. The Nuggets scored the first 13 points on their way to a 45-point rout of Atlanta last November, but this time the Hawks pushed back. ""We didn't want the same thing to happen again,"" Young said. ""We wanted to get back rolling."" Jabari Parker had 20 points and nine rebounds, and Alex Len scored 17 for the Hawks, who played most of the second half without guard Kevin Huerter. Huerter was hurt when he was fouled by Nikola Jokic with 9:57 remaining in the third quarter. Jokic slapped down on his arm as Huerter was starting to go up with the ball and he immediately grabbed his left arm. He was holding the arm against his body as he walked to the locker room. Huerter was ruled out for the game later in the period. ""He had a hot start and with him going down it was tough,"" Young said. Will Barton led Denver with 21 points, Jokic had 20 and Paul Millsap added 19. The Nuggets had their three-game winning streak snapped. The main reason was Young, who has bounced back from scoring nine points against Chicago last week to eclipse the 30-point mark in three straight games. ""It was just the Trae Young show for 48 minutes,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. Young, who had 17 points in the first half, shouldered the load on offense after Huerter left. Young put up 10 points in the third and then carried the Hawks in the fourth, scoring more than half of their 27 points. ""It felt better because we won,"" Young said. ""I'm glad I was able to knock some shots down and help us win."" Denver rallied early in the fourth to tie it at 101 but Young hit a pair of 3-pointers and a floater to put Atlanta ahead 114-106. The Nuggets couldn't get closer than four the rest of the way. ""He's got an ultra green light,"" Denver guard Gary Harris said. ""He's capable of pulling up right after half court. It makes it tough to guard."" Atlanta trailed by nine after one but outscored Denver 38-20 in the second to take a 63-54 lead at halftime. The Hawks increased their lead to 13 in the third. TIP-INS Hawks: F Allen Crabbe (knee) was dressed but coach Lloyd Pierce didn't want to use him. ""He's still in the emergency situation. We needed a body to dress,"" Pierce said. ... Atlanta shot 68 percent (15 of 22) in the second quarter. Nuggets: G Malik Beasley was inactive due to illness. He sat out the second half of Sunday's win at Minnesota. ... The 38 points allowed in the second quarter and the 63 points in the first half were the most Denver has given up. CROWD CONTROL Young helped stave off a third-quarter rally by Denver when he drained a 3-pointer in front of the Nuggets bench. He then turned and stared into the seats before running up the court. ""Some of it was the bench but some of it was to one of the dudes in the crowd,"" Young said. ""I'm not about to get fined talking about it. Sometimes what the fans say is unacceptable. I can't say nothing to him, I can't do anything towards him, I can just get buckets and look at him. ""He stopped talking as much."" FINDING FAULT Pierce was happy with most of Young's performance but thought the guard could have done better. ""I wasn't impressed with his free throws. He went 8 for 11; he's got to go 11 for 11,"" Pierce said. ""He missed two the other night, he missed three tonight. It's always something. Everybody else can praise him -- I've got to stay on him.""","401160792"
"LeBron James reacts to Kyle Kuzma's big game in the Lakers' win vs. the Suns and how Kuzma's success will benefit the team moving forward. (0:41) PHOENIX --  Kyle Kuzma was out on the floor in the crucial final minutes on Tuesday night when his teammates made the extra pass and found him at the 3-point line. Both times, he never hesitated to take the shots that splashed through the net and pushed the Lakers to a 123-115 over the Phoenix Suns. Nobody looked happier than Anthony Davis and LeBron James. They'll take all the help they can get. ""Welcome back,"" Davis said they told Kuzma. Davis had 24 points and 12 rebounds and Kuzma added a season-high 23 points on 9 of 16 shooting to push the Lakers (8-2) to their best 10-game start since 2010 and bounce back from a home loss to Toronto on Sunday. James added 19 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds. Phoenix (6-4) trailed for a big chunk of the fourth quarter but pushed ahead 113-111 on Devin Booker's fastbreak layup with 3:29 left. The Lakers responded with three straight 3-pointers -- one from James and two more from Kuzma -- to lead 120-113 and put the game out of reach. Kuzma missed the first four games of the season this year because of an ankle injury he suffered during the summer while playing for USA basketball. He averaged 18.7 points last season but was scoring just over 10 per game until Tuesday's outburst. ""I've just got teammates who believe in me,"" Kuzma said. ""We all believe in each other. We're a team and we pick each other up."" Los Angeles dominated in the paint with 70 points. Dwight Howard came off the bench to score 12 points and grab nine rebounds in 20 minutes. The Lakers had 39 assists on 51 made field goals. ""That is the secret for us,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""If you truly commit to the extra pass offensively and playing for each other, we are going to be near unbeatable. That was a really good team we beat tonight -- that's a really good win."" The Suns were led by Ricky Rubio and Booker, who both scored 21 points. Aron Baynes added 20 and Dario Saric had 18. ""Down the stretch we have to be better,"" Booker said. ""Rebound better, execute better. We didn't do that tonight. Davis scored 14 points as the Lakers took a 60-58 halftime lead. James added nine points and eight assists. CLOSE GAME The Lakers' 3-point barrage in the final minutes ended a very close game for most of the night. Neither team ever led by double figures and there were 29 lead changes and 14 ties. According to the Elias Sports Bureau that was the most lead changes in a Suns game since 2009. HURTING DAVIS Davis had another productive game despite taking ""a shot"" to the ribs during the first quarter. He went to the locker room to get it wrapped, but quickly returned and shot 9 of 17 from the field. Davis said he wasn't sure if he'd play against Golden State, which is a quick turnaround on Wednesday. The 6-foot-10 forward said he would see how his body responded in the morning. ""I just want to play,"" Davis said. ""It's tough for me to lead from the sideline."" TOUGH NIGHT Phoenix's Kelly Oubre Jr. had a rough night, scoring just one point in 19 minutes. He shot 0 of 5 from the field, including 0 of 4 from 3-point range. The bad shooting night snapped a career-high streak of scoring in double figures for 22 consecutive games. EFFICIENT BOOKER Booker came into the game shooting 54.5% from the field, 53.2% on 3-pointers and 92.3% on free throws. He's still on his 50/50/90 pace after shooting 9 of 18 from the field against the Lakers. He also had nine assists on Tuesday.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah survived a sluggish start by putting together a dominant finish against Brooklyn. The Jazz clamped down defensively during critical stretches in the fourth quarter of a 119-114 win over the Nets on Tuesday night. Utah allowed a single basket over the final three minutes and pushed the pace on offense just enough to pull ahead for good in the last minute. It ultimately helped the Jazz complete a rally from a 15-point deficit. ""They came out and they hit us first, but we came in and understood what we needed to do,"" Mitchell said. ""We picked it up on the defensive end and made it tougher on them and we were able to get stops and then run."" Mitchell scored 30 points to lead Utah. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 15 rebounds. Mike Conley also chipped in 18 points. Utah went ahead for good after Gobert scored on back-to-back possessions in the final 90 seconds. Gobert's second basket, a dunk, gave the Jazz a 116-114 lead with 55.6 seconds remaining. Irving missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 7.6 seconds left. Conley and Mitchell hit 3-of-4 free throws in the final seconds to close it out. ""They made some hustle plays, of course, off my misses down the stretch,"" Irving said. ""We had a good chance down the stretch, a good look at the rim from the 3-point line . but things happen in the basketball world, you just gotta live with it."" Irving finished with 27 points to lead Brooklyn. Spencer Dinwiddie added 21 points off the bench. DeAndre Jordan added 15 points and a season-high 17 rebounds. The Jazz looked flat taking the court after playing on the road at Golden State the night before. Brooklyn took advantage and built a double-digit lead before halftime. Jarrett Allen made two free throws and scored on a second-chance dunk to cap a 19-7 run that gave the Nets a 55-43 lead late in the second quarter. Brooklyn led 68-53 when Prince and Irving made back-to-back baskets in the final minute before halftime. ""We weren't defending the way that we could and also we were sluggish offensively,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We just had to be sharper mentally."" Utah roared to life in the third. The Jazz opened the quarter on a 13-0 run. Conley stole the ball and fed it to Bogdanovic for a layup to cap the run and cut Brooklyn's lead to 68-66. The Nets went four minutes without making a field goal before Irving broke the drought with back-to-back baskets. Brooklyn appeared on the verge of pulling away when Jordan sank two free throws to help the Nets go ahead 92-84 heading into the fourth quarter. Green and Mudiay combined for six straight baskets to open the quarter and pushed Utah to a 103-98 lead with 7:52 left. Mudiay finished with 15 points and Jeff Green added 13. 19 of their 28 points came early in the fourth quarter. ""I thought we had two bad stretches: the beginning of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Those are the two bad stretches and against an excellent team, our margin is very small, especially on the road."" GETTING DEFENSIVE Utah attacked Irving defensively by rotating between Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles onto him. O'Neale guarded the Nets point guard to start the game and Ingles took over down the stretch. They were able to limit him to 10-of-30 shooting -- including just 2-of-12 from the perimeter. Irving went 2-of-11 from the field in the fourth quarter and didn't make a basket over the final seven minutes. ""I felt like I had some great looks at the 3-point line,"" he said. ""The whole night, I just felt like I had some great looks. I'm gonna shoot it better. If I make `em, it's a different story."" QUICK TURNAROUND Utah took the court less than 24 hours after earning a road win against the Warriors. The Jazz didn't arrive in Salt Lake until 4 am and the fatigue was evident in the early part of the game. By halftime, Utah was shooting just 40% from the field and was 1-of-13 from 3-point range. In the second half, the Jazz shot 53% from the field and went 5-of-13 from outside. ""It took us a while to wake up,"" Conley said. ""We did a good job of handling it and it was just a good overall win despite everything else."" TIP INS Nets: Caris LaVert sat out with a sprained right thumb. ... Jordan dished out a season-high four assists. He also had 12 defensive rebounds, the most of any Nets player in a single game this season.  ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  After a slow and sluggish start in their first game without leading scorer De'Aaron Fox, Sacramento eventually found a nice rhythm with Bogdan Bogdanovic running the offense. Luke Walton was even more impressed with his team's defense, something that's been an ongoing issue for the Kings. Bogdanovic had 25 points and 10 assists, Nemanja Bjelica added 19 points and 12 rebounds and the Kings won in their first game since losing leading scorer Fox to an ankle injury, beating the slumping Portland Trail Blazers 107-99 on Tuesday night. Sacramento forced 17 turnovers and prevented Portland's potent backcourt tandem of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum from taking over. ""It's what we've been preaching about every day since Day 1 of training camp,"" Walton said. ""I'll be the first to admit it needs to get a lot better. We started the game, we couldn't make anything. That's why defense is important. Every night won't go like that but the competitive level that we played with on the defensive end tonight, that needs to be a steady constant for us."" The Kings overcame a sloppy first half when they shot 36.7 percent, made a big run in the third quarter, then pulled away in the fourth to end a two-game losing streak to the Blazers. Fox suffered a Grade 3 sprain in his left ankle during practice Monday. The third-year point guard, who started 81 games last season, will be reevaluated in a few weeks. ""Ankle sprains happen a lot in the NBA. But it is unfortunate that it is as severe as it is,"" Walton said. ""What's important is that our team comes together, grows, fights, and gets better. And he attacks his rehab and get back with us as soon as he can."" Bjelica helped make up for the loss of Fox. He made eight of his 14 shots and set a season-high for rebounds in his first double-double of the season. Buddy Hield added 20 points. Lillard had 27 points and McCollum added 24 for the Blazers (4-7), who have lost five of six. Nearly half of Lillard's points (13) came at the free throw line. ""The third quarter got away from us defensively and we had some trouble with matchups,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""They got off to a good start in the third quarter and built a lead. We really couldn't recover after that."" The Kings led by 14 early in the fourth quarter before the Blazers chipped away and pulled within 98-93 on a 3-pointer from Anfernee Simons with 2:51 remaining. Bjelica answered with a 3, and after McCollum scored for Portland, Cory Joseph added a 3-pointer that made it 104-95. Joseph, starting in place of Fox, missed his first five shots before that. ""We kept fighting, played great defense and we knew we were going to make shots in the second half,"" Bjelica said. ""Everybody played well."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland missed 11 of its first 15 shots outside the arc. ... Whiteside went to the bench with his third foul 6  1/2 minutes into the first quarter. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Ja Morants winning layup left the rookie flexing and shouting at the crowd and sent father Tee racing down the sideline while pumping his knees high in the air, filled with excitement over his sons big moment. Yep, Morants homecoming game went about as well as he could have hoped. With his parents sitting courtside and nearly 100 friends in the stands, Morant scored on a driving left-handed layup with 0.7 seconds left to give the Memphis Grizzlies 119-117 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. The South Carolina native had his first double-double with 23 points and 11 assists to help the Grizzlies win consecutive games for the first time this season. It definitely felt good, Morant said. Coach called the play, they switched and I just attacked. Morant got a chuckle at his fathers reaction, but wasnt surprised. That just shows how much he loves the game and how excited he was, Morant said. I looked and he was already at half court. I was like, Bro, your seat is down on the baseline. But thats just him. Hes always hype. The Hornets battled back from 10 down in the fourth quarter to tie it on a 3-pointer by Devonte Graham from the top of the key with 22.7 seconds left. But after a timeout, Morant got a screen near the top of the key and drove left against Cody Martin and somehow got the layup to fall between three Hornets, including 7-foot center Cody Zeller. I was just trying to contest it, Zeller said. He made a tough shot. Morant wouldnt repeat what he said to the crowd. Id rather not say, he said with a smile. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said the goal was to have Morant make a play coming out of the timeout. Try to put Ja in a position where he could attack one-on-one to score, maybe play make for someone else and then have Brandon Clarke go crash the offensive boards, Jenkins said. Jonas Valanciunas was one of the beneficiaries of Morants passes, finishing with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Marko Guduric had 17 points. Terry Rozier tied a career high with 33 points on seven 3-points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight games. Graham, who entered the game leading the team in points and assists, had 19 points in his first start of the season. The Hornets led by 12 in the third quarter before the Grizzlies went on a 22-5 run led by Morant. TIP INS Grizzlies: Grayson Allen, who starred at Duke a couple of hours away, did not play because of left ankle soreness. Hornets: Were outrebounded 45-35. ... Dwayne Bacon sat out with knee soreness. ... The Hornets have trailed by double digits in every game this season. MORANT VS. CONLEY Morant will face Mike Conley on Friday night, the player the Grizzlies traded away to make room for him. The rookie said the matchup is not personal. Im looking forward to playing the Utah Jazz, Conley said. Its a team game. Im not singling nobody out. Im just going to go out and do whatever I can with my teammates and come out with a win. DONT LET UP Rozier said his goal is to cut down on his turnovers. He and Graham combined for 10 of Charlottes 22 turnovers. We need to really worry about my turnovers and get better on the defensive end and control that, Rozier said. Ill be fine, me and coach communicate just about every day so we are going to get on the same page and were growing together and thats what its about.","401160796"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It took the Orlando Magic 10 3/4 games to find their offense. Nikola Vucevic had 25 points and seven Orlando players scored in double figures as the Magic came up with a big fourth quarter and beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-97 on Wednesday night. ""It was good to see the offense finally click, especially in the fourth quarter when you need it the most,"" said Vucevic, who had 12 of his points in the fourth.

Augustin, who was moved out of the starting lineup six games ago, played the entire fourth quarter, in which the Magic outscored the 76ers 32-15. Josh Richardson led the 76ers with 19 points. Ben Simmons added 18 points, eight rebounds and five assists. The 76ers played without center Joel Embiid, who has a sore left knee. ""It's easy to point to missed shots, but I feel like defensively we have to do more without Joel,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""It takes far more of a collective everything. Sometimes you can make mistakes and you have 7-foot Joel Embiid putting out fires and covering things up. We didn't have that tonight."" Orlando made 11 of its first 16 shots, and led by eight points midway through the first quarter before losing their scoring touch. A 3-pointer by Gordon at the halftime buzzer made it 53-all. Two dunks by Simmons lifted the 76ers to an eight-point lead early in the second half while the Magic went more than 5  1/2 minutes without a field goal. After a jump shot by Richardson put the 76ers up 84-80 early in the fourth quarter, Terrence Ross and Evan Fournier hit back-to-back 3-pointers and the Magic took control with an 18-3 run. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid, who dunked in the final seconds of the 76ers' 98-97 win on Tuesday night, missed his fourth game of the season, including two due to a suspension. ""Injury maintenance"" was also listed as a reason. ... Simmons, who leads the NBA in steals, did not record a steal. ... Harris is 0 for 18 from behind the arc in the last five games. Magic: Markelle Fultz, who replaced Augustin in the starting lineup, has yet to play 25 minutes as a starter and has averaged only 24.2 minutes in his five starts. ""He gets fatigued. (His minutes will increase) little by little,"" explained coach Steve Clifford. ... The Magic held the 76ers to one free throw attempt in the first half after playing a game against Indiana in which neither team shot a free throw in the first half. ...After failing to score 100 points in any of their first seven games, the Magic have gone over 100 in four straight. WHO NEEDS A JUMP SHOT? Brown on Simmons, whose nine field goals included six layups and three dunks: ""His jump shot, his 3-point shot, it gets so beaten up. But to me, the way he can impact the game the most, the quickest and the easiest is defensively. He's a 6-foot-10 thoroughbred. I think the league should take notice of him as a legitimate all-league defensive player.""","401160797"
"BOSTON --  Jayson Tatum was so disappointed in his last game that he went to the teams practice facility later that night to work on his shooting. The Boston Celtics forward could go straight home on Wednesday. Tatum followed up his historically bad shooting performance by scoring 23 points, and Kemba Walker had 25 to help the Celtics overcome 44 points from Bradley Beal and beat Washington 140-133 for Bostons ninth straight victory. Tatum was 1 for 18 in the victory over Dallas on Monday and then posted on Instagram a video of himself back at the teams practice facility,  saying, 1-18 gotta be able to laugh at ya self sometime. On Wednesday, he was 9 for 20, going 1 for 5 from 3-point range. Before the game, Im like, Every nights not gonna be the best night. Its all about the bounce back. And he bounced back tonight, Walker said. I love the way he works on off days to improve his game. We need that kid. We need him a lot, man. Jaylen Brown scored 22 and Enes Kanter had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who have not lost since the season-opener at Philadelphia; its their longest streak since winning 16 in a row in the 2017-18 season. Boston had its highest point total since 1992, but it also allowed 18 more points than in any other game this season. It was ugly, and we got it done, Brown said. But weve got to play Celtic basketball. Rui Hachimura scored 21 points and Davis Bertans had nine points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards, who lost their third straight game, and for the sixth time in seven games. Former Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas, who led Boston to the 2017 Eastern Conference finals, scored 18 and had seven assists. Boston led by two at the half and made it a six-point game after three quarters. After Bertans hit a 3 to open the fourth and make it 102-99, the Celtics ran off the next 10 points. Boston led by 16 points, 137-121, with 3:39 left in the game before the Wizards ran off 12 in a row. Walker hit a 3-pointer with just over a minute left to preserve the victory, and Hachimura missed a 3 at the other end. When you score 133 points, that should win games, Beal said. Especially on the road. Celtics forward Gordon Hayward watched from the bench, two days after he had surgery on his broken left hand. He is expected to miss six weeks. Carsen Edwards, a second-round draft choice, had a career-high 18 points for Boston. OLD FRIENDS Thomas received a standing ovation when he was introduced before the game. When he went to the free throw line in the fourth quarter, a few fans even broke out in an M-V-P! chant. It felt good to be out there, but you know I just want to win, he said. So, we didnt get the job done and that was the most important thing. Overall, it felt good to be back here and to be able to play some meaningful minutes. NO DEFENSE Celtics coach Brad Stevens noted that he was without Hayward, Daniel Theis and Robert Williams III, whom he called three very good defenders. Weve been a good defensive team all year. I would think this would be more of an anomaly than not, he said. One of the things you can do is build up a team when you have guys out. Everybody will have opportunities throughout this stretch. TIP-INS Wizards: Thomas was back for the third time since he was traded to Cleveland as part of the 2017 deal that brought Kyrie Irving to Boston. He was inactive the first time, with Cleveland, and scored zero points in seven minutes when he returned with the Nuggets on March 18, 2018. Celtics: According to Elias Sports Bureau, Tatums performance against Dallas on Monday night was the second-worst shooting performance by a Celtics player in the last 65 seasons, and matched the second-worst shooting percentage by a player on a winning team in 65 years (minimum 15 shots). He was 9 for 20 from the field and 1 for 5 from 3-point range against Washington.","401160798"
"Russell Westbrook pokes fun at Patrick Beverley, saying his reputation as a defensive stopper is overrated after James Harden scored 47 points in the Rockets' win. (0:30) HOUSTON --  James Harden was pestered and harassed on defense by Patrick Beverley for most of Houstons game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night. Despite all of Beverleys antics Harden still scored 47 points and the Rockets outlasted the Clippers 102-93 in a wild game that saw Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers ejected in the fourth quarter. Afterward, Russell Westbrook was asked about Beverleys defensive effort against Harden. Pat Bev trick y'all like he play defense, Westbrook said. He don't guard nobody, man. It's just running around doing nothing. As you seen what happened -- 47. All that commotion to get 47. Houston was up two with about two minutes left when Beverley, a former Rocket, fouled out. Harden made both free throws before grabbing a rebound on the other end and hitting a 3 to make it 95-88. Beverley was given a technical foul during a timeout after the play and Harden hit the two free throws. Rivers was then given two technical fouls and ejected to the delight of son Austin Rivers, the Houston guard who laughed and signaled for the officials to T-up his father. Doc Rivers spent several more seconds screaming at the referees before slowly walking across the court and to the locker room. Doc Rivers said after the game that he was upset with the officials because of a mix up with the number of timeouts. He said that he tried to challenge a play but that it was past the 30 seconds allotted after a play in which to make a challenge. So they told him he didnt burn a timeout on the challenge and he had two remaining. His ejection came after they said he was out of timeouts when he called the timeout where Beverley received his technical. We didn't deserve to win with the way we were playing right now offensively or defensively but mistakes like that cannot happen on this level, Doc Rivers said. That was awful and the response was to throw me out? I didn't swear. I just said: This is nuts. Crew chief Tony Brothers said the Clippers were incorrectly told that they would keep their timeout after it was determined they couldnt challenge a play. He was given an opportunity to try to get his composure, but it didnt happen, Brothers said. He came out onto the floor when we wanted to start resuming play. He was given a technical foul. The first one he says: I dont care, and he continued to stay on the floor so he was given a second technical and ejected. Austin Rivers will still laughing about the situation after the game and tweeted: Welp.... thanksgiving is going to be weird, before talking to reporters. He actually is sensitive with stuff like that so we'll see what happens, Austin Rivers said. I love him, but it was a really good moment that I enjoyed a lot ... I really enjoyed that. It was fun. Harden made both free throws before JaMychal Green made a 3 for Los Angeles. But Harden stole the ball from Kawhi Leonard, and Tyson Chandler made a reverse dunk with 37 seconds left to make it 100-91. Leonard led the Clippers with 26 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists and Lou Williams added 20 points off the bench. Westbrook added 17 points to help the Rockets win their fifth straight game. TIP-INS Clippers: F Paul George (shoulder surgery) is getting close to returning and could make his season debut in the next few days. ... Beverley had six points and two rebounds. ... Green had 20 points. Rockets: G Eric Gordon had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and is expected to miss about six weeks. Gordon was injured on Monday night against New Orleans and general manager Daryl Morey announced that he had surgery on Wednesday. ... Houston made 14 of 42 3-pointers. CAPELAS NIGHT Clint Capela had 12 points and 20 rebounds before going to the locker room with about 4 1/2 minutes remaining after taking a blow to the face while fighting for a rebound. Capela has had at least 20 rebounds in three straight games to become the first Rocket to do that since Moses Malone in 1982. Coach Mike DAntoni said after the game that he thought Capela was OK but that he was being evaluated and theyd know more on Thursday. THEY SAID IT Harden on Houstons defense: These last five or six games we've been holding teams under 100 points or right at 100 points and that's going to get us where we need to go.","401160799"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Andrew Wiggins is making an impact all over the floor, from the arc to the rim, and the Minnesota Timberwolves are playing with a carefree connectedness that has helped elevate their overall performance. These developments are not mutually exclusive. Wiggins kept up his early season surge with 30 points on 12-for-23 shooting, and the Timberwolves handed the San Antonio Spurs their third straight loss, 129-114 on Wednesday night. ""Hey, if you haven't watched us much, these guys are fun to be around,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, giving Minnesota's maximum-contract duo a third consecutive game with 25-plus points apiece. Towns and Wiggins are currently the only teammates in the NBA averaging more than 25 points per game. Wiggins, who added eight rebounds and seven rebounds, drained a pull-up 3-pointer from the left wing in the waning seconds of the third quarter to give the Wolves their biggest lead of the night at 106-95 before they breezed through the final 12 minutes. Wiggins, who has shown a sharp improvement in shot selection under Saunders, received a standing ovation when he was removed late in the game. ""I feel like everybody is happy for each other,"" Wiggins said. ""When someone does good, there's genuine love."" DeMar DeRozan had 27 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 23 points for San Antonio, with the two stars combining to shoot 22 for 34 from the floor, but the Spurs finished just 3 for 17 from 3-point range. The Wolves were 11 for 34, a behind-the-arc advantage they rarely enjoyed in recent seasons. Though they went just 6 for 45 on Sunday in an overtime defeat against Denver and this game ranked third-worst in the league at 30.8%, the increased volume can only help. The Wolves went 15 for 34 from 3-point range at Detroit in their previous game, a season best. ""I think opponents see our organization a little differently. They've been so used to us taking mid-ranges and layups and whatever the case may be, that we never adjusted to what the game has changed to,"" Towns said. ""Not only have we now changed to what the modern NBA is, we are excelling at it tremendously well and being pioneers of excellence with it."" Towns and Wiggins have 35 games with 25-plus points apiece, the fourth-most in the NBA since Towns was a rookie in 2015-16. Wiggins hit the 30-point mark for the fourth time in five games. ""They executed, they were unselfish, and they made 3s,"" said a dismayed Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who took no questions from reporters. ""They had a lot of guys that played well, and they were aggressive. From our end, I think we were very challenged defensively, another poor outing."" The Spurs, with Tony Parker's jersey now hanging from their arena rafters next to Tim Duncan's and Manu Ginobili's, are well past the glory days of their five NBA championships. Popovich lamented their ""really soft"" defense after a 135-115 defeat against Boston last week, and they entered this game ranked just 21st in the league in average points against. They weren't exactly overflowing with intensity on the defensive end in this one, either, squandering a strong start to the second half while watching the Wolves pull away for the third consecutive quarter. Bryn Forbes missed a 3-pointer that would have broken an 83-all tie, and Jake Layman, who was continually slashing to the basket all game, dropped in a finger roll for a lead the Wolves never relinquished. DeRozan picked up a technical foul after arguing a personal foul against him, and the free throws helped the Wolves on their way. ""Nobody wants to lose, but I'd rather that we have these mistakes now. We have plenty of time to clean it up. I know for a fact that we definitely will,"" DeRozan said. TIP-INS Spurs: For the third time in 11 games this season, the Spurs allowed 120-plus points. ... DeRozan and Aldridge each hit the 20-point mark for the second game this season. They did that 24 times during the 2018-19 regular season. Timberwolves: Jeff Teague, who missed the last four games because of illness, returned to action at point guard in a reserve role, with rookie Jarrett Culver in the starting lineup for a fourth time in five games. Teague had 18 points and six assists in 23 minutes. ... The Wolves had consecutive 40-point quarters for the first time in franchise history, in the second and third. DOUBLE TECHNICALS Towns and San Antonio's Rudy Gay were given double technical fouls for a testy exchange, sparked when Gay fouled Towns while he was shooting. A few minutes later, Towns and Wiggins swished 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to break a tie and give the Timberwolves a 57-51 lead. ""I'm not a fan of getting hit with elbows, and I let him know that,"" Gay said. ""That's all.""","401160800"
"LOS ANGELES --  No Anthony Davis for the first time this season, no problem for the Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron James had 23 points and 12 assists in three quarters, Kyle Kuzma and JaVale McGee dominated the middle, and the Lakers rolled past the hobbled Golden State Warriors 120-94 on Wednesday night. Kuzma scored 22 points starting for Davis and McGee had 18 points and 17 rebounds. ""Our bigs were amazing,"" James said. ""They controlled the interior both offensively and defensively."" The Lakers improved to 9-2 despite playing without Davis, who was held out because of a sore right shoulder. ""If one of our stars go down, we have to pick up for him,"" McGee said. The Lakers had 31 assists in the second half of a back-to-back. Their 39 at Phoenix a night earlier was the franchise's most since April 14, 2009. They notched 31 against defending NBA champion Toronto. ""We know we're very good when we're moving the ball,"" said James, adding that assists totaling in the high 20s to 30s ""let's me know we're definitely paying attention."" James &amp; Co. didn't waste any time breaking out. He won the opening tip and McGee scored off his alley-oop pass. James keyed a 12-0 run with six points in the first quarter when the Lakers shot 70 percent and made five 3-pointers. Their 38 points tied a season high for points in a quarter. Los Angeles extended its lead to 18 points in the second. The Warriors scored 11 in a row to get within seven, but the Lakers quickly restored their lead to double digits at halftime. James' vicious one-handed dunk riled up the crowd. Their 67 points tied a season high for points in a half. Former Laker D'Angelo Russell scored 21 points for the Warriors, who lost their fifth in a row and fell to 2-10, worst in the West. ""We're playing hard, but we have defensive lapses and it adds up,"" Russell said. ""We have to figure it out. We have guys that are capable, but we have to continue to learn."" Golden State is but a shadow of the franchise that made five straight NBA Finals appearances. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are injured, and Kevin Durant departed in the offseason. ""We're getting a great effort but we're not executing,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""Right now, we're taking our licks and we must learn from our mistakes. Our young guys are learning by getting thrown into the fire."" Twice the Lakers led by 23 in the third, the second time on a 3-pointer by Dwight Howard. He finished with 15 points and eight rebounds. Los Angeles extended its lead to 27 in the fourth. McGee's one-handed reverse dunk highlighted a 14-5 opening run. ""We did a good job locking in on defense and put a lot of pressure on the paint,"" Kuzma said. James sat out the final period, but he still assisted, pulling Davis and DeMarcus Cousins out of their seats to join the team during a timeout. TIP-INS Warriors: Their five-game winning streak against the Lakers in LA ended. Golden State had won 10 of 11 overall in the series. ... Draymond Green had 10 points in his second game after missing five straight with a left index finger sprain. Lakers: Davis is expected to return Friday. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Toronto Raptors defense gave the team another reason to celebrate. The Raptors held Damian Lillard to just nine points in a 114-106 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Pascal Siakam scored 36 points and Fred VanVleet had 30, but the story for Toronto was a defense that made life difficult for yet another star player on their road trip. After holding LeBron James to 13 points and Kawhi Leonard to just 12 points in their last two games, taking Lillard out of the equation was another notch on the belt for the defending champions. ""It's the defense,"" VanVleet said. ""Offense comes and goes but defense has been pretty consistent for us. The good thing about our game is that most superstars are pretty unselfish so if you throw 2 or 3 guys at them they're passing. We want to make them pass and make somebody else make shots."" ""They're really trying to guard from the start of the game to the end,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of his team. ""I always talk about, can we execute our schemes, where we're supposed go, and they're doing pretty good job of that."" Siakam scored 13 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter to help close out the Trail Blazers and help Toronto bounce back from Monday night's loss to the L.A. Clippers. ""It felt like college a little bit just posting up every possession. It was fun,"" Siakam said. ""That hasn't happened in a while."" Rodney Hood led the Blazers with 25 points. Lillard, who entered Wednesday trailing only James Harden in points per game, had his worst outing of the season. Lillard had 2-fof-12 shooting from the field and was 2 of 7 from 3-point range. He did dish 10 assists. ""It's the fourth team in a row to come out denying me full court. Box-and-one, I don't remember seeing that many box-and-ones in the NBA, but I mean, they make me play against a crowd. Even when I try to get downhill and be aggressive, there's four guys right there. The right play is to kick it ahead, get it out, that was the only option they gave me a lot of times. It's just what it was."" Hood stood up to the Raptors' challenge, returning from a two-game absence with back spasms. CJ McCollum also pitched in 18 points while Anfernee Simons had 17 off the bench. Still, the Trail Blazers once again found themselves staring at a familiar postgame script. ""I get frustrated sometimes losing games, especially losing games that we were in,"" Lillard said. ""If we was getting blown out, I would be getting upset about that but it wouldn't be the same feeling. We in every game, down the stretch when it's time to win a game we're not doing the necessary things to get a win."" The Raptors attacked in waves, with Siakam scoring seven straight points to close the quarter and give the Raptors an 87-78 lead heading into the fourth. The Raptors also got solid bench contributions from Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (16 points, 11 rebounds) and Terence Davis (15 points). The Blazers went on an 11-2 run to start the fourth quarter, tying the game at 89 with 9:06 left as Lillard watched from the bench. Nassir Little made his first NBA start against the defending champs. Little drew the job of guarding Siakam. ""I thought he had a really good game,"" Stotts said of the rookie Little. ""I thought he held his own with Siakam defensively, brought a lot of energy and played hard."" Little finished with seven points and five rebounds. A dunk by Hollis-Jefferson with 5:29 left gave the Raptors a 101-94 lead. Another jumper by Siakam with 3:38 left gave the Raptors a 108-94 lead, their largest of the game. TIP-INS Raptors: The Raptors made a line-up change on Wednesday night as they were without starting small forward OG Anunoby, who is dealing with an injury to his eye. Anunoby, who walked into the Moda Center Wednesday with an eye-patch over his right eye, will likely be available to play when the Raptors finish their road trip later this weekend. ""They told me it was close for this game, that he might make it, but it's not going to happen,"" head coach Nick Nurse said. ""He will be ready to go Saturday in Dallas."" Nurse gave the starting opportunity to reserve forward Malcolm Miller, who had only appeared in two games heading into Wednesday. Trail Blazers: After entering the season with high expectations, the Blazers have sputtered out of the gate through the first 11 games of the season. Tuesday night's loss to a short-handed Sacramento Kings group was as painful as any of the losses they've had to start the season. ""We're not where we want to be,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""The losses at Golden State and (Sacramento) really took a toll. Those two teams were undermanned and if those two games are wins that changes the outlook of where we are. We've played a lot of close games, we've played a lot of good teams competitively but I'd say right now we're a middle of the road team trying to find ourselves."" Now, the Blazers will look to find themselves as they embark on a 10-day, six-game road trip.","401160802"
"CLEVELAND --  The Miami Heat didn't let a night of dominant play slip away in the fourth quarter. Rookie Kendrick Nunn scored 23 points, Bam Adebayo had 16 points and 15 rebounds and Miami, which led the entire game, held off a late Cleveland run and defeated the Cavaliers 108-97 on Thursday night. Miami, which has the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 8-3, was up by 27 points in the third quarter before Cleveland cut the lead to 98-88 with seven minutes to play. The Heat regained control and maintained a double-digit lead down the stretch. ""We found a way to win,"" said Heat forward Jimmy Butler, who had a blocked shot, a basket and a steal in the final three minutes. ""It doesn't matter how you do it, win by one, win by 20. It goes in the same column."" Miami lead 96-74 early in the fourth before Cleveland rallied. Kevin Love hit 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to spark the Cavaliers' run. Butler's basket in the lane, a 3-pointer by Duncan Robinson and four points by Adebayo kept Miami in control. ""It was turnovers, run-outs and not getting stops,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Then we gathered ourselves. Usually games do not go all according to plan and they didn't tonight, particularly in the fourth quarter."" Rookie Tyler Herro, who missed Tuesday's game with an ankle injury, had 16 points, while Butler finished with 14. Love had 21 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, while Collin Sexton added 15 points. Cleveland was coming off a 2-1 road trip and nearly beat Philadelphia on Tuesday before losing 98-97. Cavaliers coach John Beilein thinks the Heat are a good example for his rebuilding team to follow. ""They're doing everything,"" he said. ""They're playing defense as good as it is the league. Their offense is good. They're a high-functioning team. That's how we want to be day in, day out."" The Cavaliers' chances of staying with another of the league's top teams were hit with an early run. Miami made consecutive 3-pointers to take a 9-0 lead, forcing Beilein to use a timeout less than two minutes into the game. The Heat continued to roll and had a 32-15 advantage late in the period. Miami was 15 of 25 from the field and didn't go to the foul line in the quarter. Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. injured his left hand on a breakaway dunk in the fourth quarter. He went to the locker room and didn't return, watching the final minutes from the bench. Nance has played with his left thumb wrapped for several games. ""I'll be all right,"" he said. ""I'm going to get some treatment so we'll know more later. I'm not necessarily certain (what happened). I just felt the pain."" The Heat shot 43 of 79 from the field and made 12 of 30 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Heat: F James Johnson was available after being out Tuesday because of illness, but didn't play. ... Robinson played for Beilein at the University of Michigan. ... Justise Winslow (concussion), Derrick Jones Jr. (hip), KZ Okpala (Achilles) were out for Miami. Cavaliers: Cleveland was 13 of 15 from the foul line in the first half, and still trailed by 22 points. ... F Tristan Thompson, who had eight doubles-doubles in the first 10 games, was held to two points and three rebounds in 23 minutes. BIG NUMBERS Miami had 31 assists, after having 34 on Tuesday. ""They should come every single game just because we share the ball so well,"" Butler said. ""We've got guys who can get the ball to the basket so that always helps."" Beilein, pointing out the Cavaliers are 27th in the league in assists, believes that is another example for his players. ""That tells stories about everything, that the ball's not moving the way it can move,"" he said. ""Most winning teams have high assist numbers. They know that, just making that extra pass is going to be key for them to see that.""","401160803"
"Kristaps Porzingis comments on his return to Madison Square Garden and the reaction from Knicks fans. (1:12) NEW YORK --  Kristaps Porzingis couldnt even hide from the taunts during the national anthem. Hes an enemy now to Knicks fans, and they treated him as rudely as any foe that has played at Madison Square Garden in recent years. I get it around this league, Knicks forward Marcus Morris said, but it was a different level. Morris made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 13 seconds remaining and New York beat the Dallas Mavericks 106-103 on Thursday night. Porzingis was the No. 4 pick in the 2015 draft who developed first into a fan favorite and then an All-Star. But he soured on the Knicks, and the fans have clearly soured on him. They jeered him when the Mavs hit the floor for pregame warmups, continued during the national anthem, when Porzingis won the opening tip and whenever else he touched the ball in the early going. ""I wouldn't say it affected me, Porzingis said. I heard it of course. It was pretty loud. But I tried to play my game, stay focused and not think too much about what's going on on the outside."" Morris also knocked away the Mavericks inbounds pass with under a second left, sending the Knicks to just their third victory in 12 games this season. Porzingis finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds in his first game in New York as a visitor. Luka Doncic had 33 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in his fifth triple-double of the season. Morris scored 20 points and Julius Randle had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who were playing their first home game since they were routed Sunday by Cleveland. Afterward, team President Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry held a press conference to express their disappointment with the teams start. They were much better in this one, fueled by a crowd like few others during the down years while Porzingis was a Knick. Porzingis was playing at MSG for the first time since tearing his ACL on Feb. 6, 2018. While rehabbing the injury, he was surprisingly dealt to Dallas on Jan. 31 after Knicks management said he told them in a meeting that day that he didnt want to stay with the franchise. Porzingis has declined to talk about what caused the deterioration of his relationship with the team, so he understood why there would be such a harsh reception. ""It's what they know. It's what they've heard, he said. It is what it is. We came here to win a game and we're frustrated we didn't get it done."" Porzingis looked rattled at the beginning and then confused in the middle, appearing to walk toward the wrong tunnel at halftime before stopping and turning to exit the opposite direction. He couldnt silence the early boos with a basket, missing his first four shots before finally getting his first field goal on a tip-in about four minutes into the second quarter. ""I've been coming here a long time. Nothing surprises me in here. It was what it was, Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. We knew it was going to be a difficult atmosphere regardless of what the exact response was."" Doncic missed his first six 3-pointers, then made three in a row late in the third quarter. When he finally missed another, Porzingis soared in to slam home the miss with 0.4 seconds left and tie it at 87-all headed to the fourth. TIP-INS Mavericks: After going 1 for 11 on Monday in a loss at Boston, Porzingis finished 7 for 17. ... Tim Hardaway Jr., who was part of the trade with Porzingis, scored 12 points off the bench. Knicks: Mitchell Robinson had 16 points and eight rebounds after being cleared to return from a concussion following a three-game absence. ... The Knicks ended a five-game winning streak by visiting teams in the series, including their victory last Friday in Dallas. SMITH STARS Dennis Smith Jr., the former Mav who came to New York in the Porzingis trade, had 13 points, eight assists and six rebounds. He was shooting just 1 for 14 for the season coming into the game, having recently returned after missing seven games following a death in the family. Just grateful, Smith said. Glad to be playing. Glad to be out there with these guys. Glad to have people that believe in me, so just a lot of gratitude.","401160804"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo ensured the Milwaukee Bucks dominance over the Chicago Bulls didnt end Thursday night. Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 15 rebounds, Eric Bledsoe added a season-high 31 points and eight assists, and the Bucks withstood another historic effort by Chicago rookie Coby White to beat the Bulls 124-115. The Bucks have won seven straight against Chicago dating to 2017. White shot 5 of 8 from 3-point range in the first half, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to hit five 3-pointers in consecutive games. The 19-year-old first-round pick hit seven 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of a 120-102 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night -- the most in a quarter ever by a rookie. White finished Thursday with 26 points, including six 3s. He was terrific, Bulls coach Jim Boylen said of White. I thought a lot of our players played well. Thats a tough team. Antetokounmpo had at least 30 points for the seventh game this season for the Bucks, who played without Khris Middleton. The All-Star forward is expected to miss the next three to four weeks with a thigh bruise. Donte DiVincenzo, who made his first career start in place of Middleton, had four points and five rebounds. I think the team realized in order to win tonight, we got to drive the ball into the paint and get some paint points, Antetokounmpo said. The Bucks made just six 3s while Chicago hit 18 from long range. But Milwaukee outscored the Bulls 70-32 inside. That marked a season high in the paint for Milwaukee. Bledsoe was a perfect 12 for 12 inside the arc. I was just getting some easy looks, man, said Bledsoe, who has scored at least 20 points in each of his last five games. My teammates do a great job of spacing the court. The way they shot the ball leaves gaps for me to drive and its up to me to make those shots. The Bucks missed Middleton early, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Milwaukee struggled to create and make shots, shooting an anemic 4 of 18 from 3 in the first half and trailed 66-65 at halftime. Things switched in the second half when Antetokounmpo threw down a dunk that tied it at 82-82 with 6:37 to play in the third, prompting Boylen to call a timeout. The play ignited the crowd and jumpstarted the Bucks. Wesley Matthews scored 10 of his 15 points from the foul line for Milwaukee. Matthews had just three free-throw attempts coming into the night but had 13 Thursday. This offense is kind of predicated on spacing and ball movement, so everybody can be in any spot, Matthews said. We already can be kind of interchangeable. Were definitely going to miss (Middletons) production on the offensive end. This team is built with a lot of depth and tonight we put up 124. The offense wasnt the problem. We have to stop people. Weve got to find ways to do that. Zach LaVine had 25 points and seven assists before fouling out for Chicago. Wendell Carter Jr. added 14 points and six rebounds. He also fouled out. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had six players score in double figures (White, LaVine, Carter Jr., Lauri Markkanen, 11; Thaddeus Young, 11; and Tomas Satoransky, 10). Bucks: Center Robin Lopez finished with six points and three rebounds. Lopez spent the previous three seasons with the Bulls, averaging 10.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.1 blocks in 219 games. RoLo is a hyper-competitive dude, Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. He likes to win. He likes to win a practice game. He likes to win a 1-on-1 game, a shooting game. I like that competitive spirit that he has.","401160805"
"After his Clippers debut, Paul George says he needs more time to get a feel for real-time game-speed activities despite dropping 33 points in just 24 minutes of action. (0:44) NEW ORLEANS --  Paul George expected to shoot well in his Clippers debut because his surgically repaired shoulders felt great. It was the rest of his game -- from ball handling to defense  that concerned him. Jrue Holiday scored 36 points and stole the ball from George three times in the final minutes to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 132-127 victory over Los Angeles on Thursday night. I thought I was terrible, said George, who was limited to 24 minutes by early foul trouble but still scored 33 points. Thats the best my shoulders have felt in a really long time, so I knew coming into tonight shooting wouldnt be a problem, George added. Just playing basketball is what Im lacking right now. George was playing for the first time since signing as a free agent with the Clippers because hed been recovering from procedures in May on his right shoulder and June on his left. A lot of breakdowns happened because of my lack of being out there with those guys, George said. Im here to win games and I didnt get a win. ... We had a chance to win tonight and a couple bad possessions in a row that we have down the stretch and we lose. Thats what I gauge good games and bad games on. Holiday, who had six steals in all, intercepted of Lou Williams attempted bounce pass in the final seconds to seal the victory. The play capped off a night in which Holiday scored 12 in the final 4:20, including a pair of pivotal 3s. It felt good, said Holiday, who hadnt scored as many as 20 points in any of his previous eight games. Its all about timing and rhythm. I felt like I got a little bit of that back tonight. Derrick Favors, in his first season with New Orleans, had 20 points and a career-best 20 rebounds in the first 20-20 game of his 10-year career. Im starting to get comfortable now and just try to keep it going throughout the year, Favors said. It was a great game for me, a great game for the team, and we came out and played hard, but we just have to stay consistent. Frank Jackson added 23 points in a reserve role. The Clippers played without Kawhi Leonard, who was being rested for the third time this season to ease stress on his sore knee after playing a night earlier in a loss at Houston. But the Pelicans were hardly sympathetic with starters Brandon Ingram (right knee) and Lonzo Ball (groin) sidelined, as well. Georges 3 cut the Pelicans lead to 126-123 with 42 seconds left. But the Clippers left Jackson unguarded on the perimeter on the other end, and he took his time squaring up and connecting on his fourth 3 of the game to restore New Orleans six-point lead with 30 seconds left. J.J. Reddick, who started and scored 19, hit two free throws with 11.4 seconds left to help wrap up just New Orleans third victory in 11 games this season. Williams scored 31 points and Rodney McGruder 20 for the Clippers, whove dropped two straight. TIP-INS Clippers: Montrezl Harrell had 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting. ... McGruder came in 1 of 6 on 3s for the season and hit 5 of 7 in New Orleans. ... The Clippers were 11 of 24 from 3, with George hitting 3 of 5. ... Patrick Beverly also sat out with a sore left calf Pelicans: ETwaun Moore scored 15 in his first start of the season as the Pelicans used their eighth starting lineup in their first 11 games. ... Guard Josh Hart (left knee and ankle sprains) and center Jahlil Okafor (left ankle sprain) both joined Ingram, Ball and top draft choice Zion Williamson in street clothes on the bench. MOMENTUM SHIFTS The Pelicans trailed 43-36 early in the second quarter when they put together the games first big run. Favors scored six straight points on a free throw, a tip-in and his first 3-pointer of the season from the left corner. Holidays 3 soon after capped a 13-1 run which put New Orleans up 50-44. Holiday added two more 3s, and Jackson another to widen New Orleans lead to 14 at 66-52. Holidays driving dunk and finger roll pushed his two-quarter point total to 24, and the Pelicans led 72-59 at halftime. George opened the second half with a driving layup, pull-up jumper and a 3 as part of an 11-2 run to make it 74-70. Los Angeles inched ahead when Williams hit a 3 and followed with a driving layup as he was fouled to make it 88-86. Neither team led by more than eight after that.","401160806"
"PHOENIX --  Kelly Oubre Jr. followed his worst game of the season with his best and its a huge reason the Phoenix Suns kept rolling through their early season schedule. Oubre scored a season-high 30 points, Devin Booker added 27 and the Suns beat the Atlanta Hawks 128-112 on Thursday night. Phoenix (7-4) took a 104-90 lead into the final quarter after Oubre nailed a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the third and kept a comfortable lead throughout the fourth. The Suns are off to their best start through 11 games since 2009, when they started 9-2. Oubres big performance came two days after a rare off-night. He scored just one point in 19 minutes in a loss to the Lakers. It feels good, but at the end of the day I try not to get too high or too low, Oubre said. I could have been super low and not done this today. Just trying to stay level is my main thing. Being like water. Dario Saric added 23 points after shooting 9 of 12 from the field, including 3 of 5 from 3-point range. I just think Dario is a guy that I need to incorporate more, Suns coach Monty Williams said. He makes the right plays, he can shoot the ball, hes efficient. Atlanta (4-7) was led by Jabari Parker, who scored 24 points. Trae Young had 21 points and 13 assists two nights after a 42-point, 11-assist performance in a win over Denver. The banged-up Hawks were missing several key players due to injuries. Not a fun game, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Thats all I got. Its all we got. Weve got no bodies. Its just one of those nights the whistle didnt go our way. Parker wasnt thrilled with the officiating, either. The Hawks were called for 31 fouls, including several on the offensive end. I am from Chicago, Illinois, Parker said. I played in the public league and we never called offensive fouls that much, but I mean, that was the pace of the game, thats just how it went down and hopefully we can get them back when we come home. Booker scored 19 points in the first half as the Suns built a 67-61 halftime lead. Young had 17 points and six assists for the Hawks. MISSING PIECES Both the Hawks and the Suns were missing key pieces to their teams because of 25-game suspensions for violating the NBAs Anti-Drug program. Suns center Deandre Ayton played in just one game before being suspended for using a diuretic. Hawks forward John Collins tested positive for a growth hormone called Peptide-2. Ayton was the No. 1 pick one year ago and had 18 points and 11 rebounds in his only game this season. Collins was averaging 17 points and 8.8 rebounds before his suspension. BEMBRY, REDDISH EJECTED Hawks guard DeAndre Bembry was ejected in the third quarter after getting called for two quick technical fouls. He got the first technical for taunting after blocking Ricky Rubios shot. He earned the second a few seconds later for arguing. Booker also was called for a technical during the commotion. Rookie Cam Reddish was ejected with about four minutes left after getting two flagrant fouls on two separate plays on offensive fouls when he hit a Suns defender in the face with his elbow. LENS BIG GAME Atlanta center Alex Len had one of his best games of the season with 21 points and 10 rebounds, including five on the offensive end. Len was booed occasionally throughout the game. He was drafted by the Suns with the fifth overall pick in 2013, but struggled during five rough seasons before signing with the Hawks. TIP-INS Hawks: Kevin Huerter (left shoulder), Evan Turner (left Achilles pain) and Vince Carter (personal reasons) didnt play on Thursday. Coach Lloyd Pierce said the Hawks are relieved that Huerter doesnt need surgery for his injury and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Suns: Rookie guard Ty Jerome still hasnt played this season because of a right ankle sprain he suffered just before the beginning of the regular season. ... Frank Kaminsky scored 19 points on Thursday and Cam Johnson added 15.","401160807"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic had plenty of postgame jokes -- about the bench and especially about Paul Millsap. The Denver big man was simply in a playful mood after another come-from-behind win. Jokic had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Mason Plumlee provided a boost off the bench and the Nuggets wore down the Brooklyn Nets in a 101-93 win Thursday night. For that, Jokic credited the bench's second-half performance. ""Not that much in the first half,"" he quipped before patting Plumlee on the back and adding, ""but they were phenomenal in the second."" His next target? Millsap, who finished with 18 points. ""Paul is playing like he's 21 not 77,"" Jokic said of the forward who's actually 34. Millsap shook his head when the jab about his age got back to him. ""I don't know if that's a compliment or not?"" he said. ""I just feel good."" The Nuggets tired out a Nets team playing their fourth road game in seven nights. Brooklyn shot 23% and went 0 for 17 from 3-point range in the second half. All those misses helped the Nuggets stage another rally. They overcame a 21-point, four-quarter deficit in a win over Philadelphia last week. On Thursday, the Nuggets trailed by 16 points in the third quarter before using a 19-6 run to work their way back. The comeback was spurred in large part by Denver's bench. Plumlee was pivotal when Jokic went to the bench with 6:37 left in the third in foul trouble. Plumlee scored all 10 of his points in the second half. ""Plumlee, that's what he does,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I thought their second unit really gave them a boost."" Denver took its first lead since the first quarter on Jerami Grant's 3-pointer with 9:30 remaining. The Nuggets wouldn't relinquish it. Kyrie Irving had 17 points and nine assists despite a sore right shoulder. Irving was questionable earlier in the day but got treatment and was ready to go by game time. DeAndre Jordan had an interesting stat line -- 11 rebounds and no points. Jarrett Allen added 17 points and 10 boards as the Nets dropped to 1/3 on their five-game trip. ""When teams make their runs we just have to be able to respond right away,"" Irving said. ""Just settle ourselves down and really go into our offensive package and just run the plays that work for us."" The Nets entered with a dynamic offense and Denver with a top-notch defense. In the first half, Brooklyn controlled the tempo with their shooting. In the second, the Nuggets took it back with defense. They've now held opponents to fewer than 100 points in five of the last six games. ""Our defense got us going,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""That ignites our break. We started rebounding and running. That's when we're at our best."" TIP-INS Nets: F Taurean Prince was given a technical foul for a hold in the first quarter. ... G/F Garrett Temple briefly left in the third after being hit in the chin by Gary Harris' elbow. Harris was issued a flagrant foul. ... Former University of Colorado standout Spencer Dinwiddie had 17 points. Nuggets: G Malik Beasley (illness) didn't play. ... Denver had seven players in double figures. ... F Will Barton finished with 17. LEVERT UPDATE Nets guard Caris LeVert underwent surgery Thursday to repair ligaments in his right thumb. There's no timetable for his return. LeVert is averaging 16.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists. He missed half of last season with a dislocated right foot. ""It's bad luck especially with what he went through last year,"" Atkinson said. ""I feel for him."" SHUMPERT'S ROLE Veteran guard Iman Shumpert was signed Wednesday to fill a specific need for the Nets -- perimeter defense. ""That's always been his calling card,"" said Atkinson, who was an assistant coach with New York when Shumpert played for the Knicks. ""I know him well, know the personality. He gets after it defensively."" Shumpert didn't play Thursday. JUANCHO SIGHTING Juancho Hernangomez played 19 minutes. This after seeing the floor a combined 19:24 all season. He had two points but provided plenty of energy. ""Juancho is the hardest worker here,"" Jokic said. IRVING &amp; MURRAY There was some history between Irving and Nuggets guard Jamal Murray. When Irving was at Pepsi Center last November -- as a member of the Boston Celtics -- he took exception to Murray, sitting on 48 points, taking a shot in the closing seconds of a game already decided. Irving threw the ball into the stands.","401160808"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Things havent always gone the way Malik Monk hoped during his first two seasons with the Charlotte Hornets. But coach James Borrego said the third-year shooting guard never stopped working -- and now hes starting to see some big results. Monk knocked down a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Charlotte Hornets a 109-106 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night, helping snap a four-game losing streak. Every game is getting better and better, so hopefully I just keep going up, said Monk, who finished with 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting. Ive been working hard for these two or three years and Ive been waiting for my moment. It came after Pistons point guard Derrick Rose drove the lane and threw the ball away with a second left. Monk, who was the third option on the inbounds play from midcourt, came flying around a screen, caught the pass from Cody Martin and buried the jumper with a smooth stroke. Devonte Graham, who had 18 points and 10 assists in his second start, said Monk asked coach James Borrego in the huddle to run a play for him. That didnt surprise Borrego, who has seen Monks confidence grow as the season has progressed. Hes gone from a player who didnt see any action at all in some games last season to one that is starting to be ultra-aggressive, as evidenced by three coast-to-coast layups in traffic. Hes starting to shine more and more, and that comes with confidence and maturity, Borrego said. Youre starting to see signs of why we drafted him. Give him a lot credit because hes stuck with it and is getting better. Things havent worked in his favor the last couple of years, but hes owned that and hes improved. Langston Galloway had a career-high 32 points on seven 3-pointers for Detroit, and Andre Drummond added 16 points and 20 rebounds. The Pistons have lost four straight. This is the second time this team got us at the buzzer here, so its tough, Galloway said. Its a tough one to swallow. TIP INS Pistons: Bruce Brown and Cody Zeller had to be separated after getting tied up underneath the basket midway through the fourth quarter. They were called for double fouls. Hornets: Graham got his second straight start with Dwayne Bacon (sore right knee) still out. ... Coach James Borrego got a technical when he argued an offensive foul against Miles Bridges when he accidentally elbowed Griffin in the head. GRIFFINS RETURN Blake Griffin had 19 points on 6-of-19 shooting after missing the last three games with left hamstring and posterior knee soreness. ROSES TURNOVER Pistons coach Dwane Casey said the teams final play was designed to have Rose kick the ball out to the corner, but instead the veteran point guard dished to the wing. However, nobody was there and the ball sailed out of bounds. It hurt a lot, but Ill take the blame for tonight, Rose said. Late turnovers and Ill figure it out. Casey said he doesnt fault Rose. He got in the paint and got where he wanted to go, Casey said. He just didnt make the right decision on his kickout. ANOTHER SLOW START In what has become a disturbing trend for the Hornets, they started slow and dug themselves an 11-2 hole after missing six of their first seven shots. Charlotte (5-7) has trailed by double digits in all 12 games this season. I dont know why we keep coming out so flat -- 9-0 starts and getting down 10, 12, 15 and then start to ramp it up, Graham said. We need to be able to come out with that same energy that we play with when were down 15.","401160809"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  When Evan Fournier and Terrence Ross hit shots with the game on the line, the Orlando Magic are a much different team. Fournier scored 26 points, including a couple of late 3-pointers, and the Magic beat San Antonio 111-109 on Friday night to hand the Spurs their fourth straight defeat. Ross had 10 of his season-high 20 points in the fourth quarter to help the Magic win consecutive games for the first time this season. ""That's what T-Ross does, time and time again, when we win games,"" said Aaron Gordon, who had 14 points and eight rebounds. ""He steps up and makes big shots. We needed them tonight badly."" Fournier's 3-pointer with 1:15 remaining put the Magic ahead to stay. He shot 5 of 6 from behind the arc in his highest-scoring game of the season. ""When T-Ross and I both make shots, it just spreads the floor and it gives us more opportunity,"" Fournier said. ""Then the paint is open for Vuc (Nikola Vucevic). It's the lineup we mostly ended games with last year and it's the lineup we are comfortable with."" DeMar DeRozan scored 21 for the Spurs, who shot 50.6 percent from the field but gave up 64 points in the second half and were outrebounded 48-41. ""I think the difference in the game was we gave up too many offensive rebounds (14),"" DeRozan said. ""We couldn't get the rebounds when it counted and they did. They executed on those, and other than that it was a one-possession game."" A flagrant foul call helped the Magic maintain their lead in the final seconds. After Trey Lyles' 3-pointer cut Orlando's advantage to 107-106 with 18 seconds left, Gordon drew a foul on DeRozan with 13.9 seconds remaining that was upgraded to a flagrant after a replay review. Gordon made the free throws and the Magic kept the ball, enabling Vucevic to add another foul shot for a four-point edge. A 3-pointer by Bryn Forbes with 4:17 left in the second quarter put San Antonio up 50-34, the largest lead for either team. The Spurs shot 53 percent in the first half and led 56-47 at halftime. Orlando ran off 12 straight points early in the third quarter and took a 69-66 lead on a 3 by Fournier. Patty Mills and Jakob Poeltl provided points off the bench to pull the Spurs back ahead. They went up 99-92 when LaMarcus Aldridge hit a 3 with 4:42 left. TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray played 21 minutes but will sit out Saturday night against Portland, part of the plan for his recovery from knee surgery a year ago. ... Aldridge missed all six of his shots in the first half. ... The Spurs have given up 122 points per game during their losing streak. Magic: F Jonathan Isaac did not play after rolling his right ankle Thursday night during the unveiling of the Magic's City-Edition uniforms at Disney World. ""We were taking pictures, just shooting around and I got a little careless,"" said Isaac, the first Orlando starter to miss a game this season. He hopes to play Sunday against Washington. ... F Al-Farouq Aminu grabbed 13 rebounds in his first start for the Magic. ... G Michael Carter-Williams was called for three fouls in 13 seconds late in the first quarter. ... Vucevic shot 4 for 16. INJURIES HAPPEN Magic coach Steve Clifford on Isaac's bizarre injury: ""People always say I shouldn't leave guys in at the end of the game when we have a 12-point lead because somebody might get hurt. Hey, somebody could get hurt walking down the hall. It happens all the time.""","401160810"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets got another huge offensive game from James Harden. But it was the team's defense against the Indiana Pacers that the Rockets thought was the most impressive part of their win. Harden scored 44 points and the Rockets used a big fourth quarter run to pull away and get the 111-102 victory on Friday night. Houston has won a season-high six games in a row and Harden has scored 36 points or more in five straight games to carry the Rockets as they deal with injuries to Clint Capela, Eric Gordon and Danuel House. Indiana led by 4 on a 3-pointer by Doug McDermott before Houston used a 14-0 spurt to make it 94-88 with about five minutes left. Harden took over in that stretch, scoring the last 12 points and making two 3-pointers. The Pacers couldn't do anything offensively as Houston built its lead and missed seven shots and had two turnovers. Harden was asked how big the team's defense in that stretch was to the win. ""It was huge,"" Harden said. ""That's the game right there."" Indiana got its first point in almost five minutes when Domantas Sabonis made the second of two free throws with less than five minutes to go and Justin Holiday made a layup about a minute later. But Russell Westbrook hit a 3-pointer seconds after that to push the Rockets' lead to 10 with three minutes remaining. Though the defense has improved during this winning streak, Westbrook still sees room for improvement. ""We're moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We're doing a good job of staying locked in for the most part ... and it's showing."" The Pacers cut it to six points with a 3 by Aaron Holiday with about a minute left, but Tyson Chandler added a tip-in layup to secure the victory. Sabonis had 18 points and 13 rebounds and McDermott added 18 points off the bench as Indiana had its four-game winning streak was snapped. Ben McLemore had a season-high 21 points and Westbrook scored 17 with eight rebounds and six assists. ""He hit some timely 3s,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said of McLemore. ""His defense is always pretty good. He runs the floor. He plays really hard and he can shoot. So yeah -- he was good."" A dunk by Justin Holiday got the Pacers within four points midway through the third quarter before Houston used an 8-2 run to make it 75-65 with about four minutes left in the quarter. McLemore led the way in that stretch with two 3-pointers. The Pacers got going after that, scoring the next 10 points to tie it with about a minute left in the third. Houston missed five shots and had a turnover to allow Indiana to close the gap. Austin Rivers ended a scoring drought of more than three minutes by Houston after that, but Indiana scored the next four points to take a 79-77 lead. Houston entered the fourth quarter up by 1 after P.J. Tucker hit a 3-pointer at the end of the third. The Pacers, who were already without Myles Turner and Jeremy Lamb because of injuries, played most of Friday's game without Malcolm Brogdon after he left in the first quarter with a sore lower back. ""That's a big loss when you're going up against guys like Harden and Westbrook,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""Not only do you need him offensively but you need his size defensively."" TIP-INS Pacers: Turner missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle, but could return on Saturday night. ... Lamb sat out for the fifth game in a row with a sprained left ankle. ... T.J. Warren busted his lip and was bleeding after a collision in the third quarter. He was tended to by a trainer for a few minutes and re-entered the game late in the quarter. Rockets: C Capela missed the game and won't play on Saturday after sustaining a concussion on Wednesday night. ... Rivers scored 10 points off the bench. ... Houston made 14 of 46 3-pointers. LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON Chandler made his first start of the season in place of Capela at center against Sabonis. It wasn't the first time he'd played against a member of the Sabonis family, after playing two games against Sabonis's father, Arvydas Sabonis, in his last NBA season in 2002-03. Chandler, who was in his second NBA season, was 20 that year and Arvydas Sabonis was 38. ""Both of them are great players,"" the 37-year-old Chandler said. ""His dad was huge and so skilled. I think I caught him at the end of his career after injuries and all that. But his son is really good and has a bright future ahead of him.""","401160811"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Memphis celebrated former point guard Mike Conleys returned to town. It was his rookie replacement with the Grizzlies who stole the show. Ja Morant, the No. 2 pick in last summers draft, scored 25 points, including the go-ahead basket with 1:32 remaining, Dillon Brooks added 20 point and Memphis beat the Utah Jazz 107-106 on Friday night, spoiling Conleys homecoming. Morant added eight assists along with several highlight-worthy plays. While the rookie from Murray State is still learning control of his speed and flashiness, it already appears Memphis has found a suitable replacement to Conley for the long term. Hes incredible, Jaren Jackson Jr. said of Morant. His change of speeds, change of direction is just different. Its something you dont find too often. Its kind of a once-in-a-lifetime talent. Morant's inside basket gave Memphis a 107-105 lead. Utahs Rudy Gobert split a pair of free throws with 53 seconds left and both teams missed shots down the stretch. Utah had one last chance when the ball was inbounded to Donovan Mitchell with two seconds left. But as Mitchell turned, Solomon Hill stripped the ball away, giving Memphis its third straight win. I got fouled. Really not much else to it, Mitchell said. They defended it well, but hit my whole arm. This is the third time its happened at the end of the game and havent gotten a foul call, which at this point is ridiculous. Utah coach Quin Snyder said: I havent seen the last play. Its hard to tell, Obviously, its a no-call, so its hard to challenge. The game marked the return of Conley, the long-time Memphis guard who spent his entire career with the Grizzlies until a trade to Utah over the summer. While there was plenty of admiration from his former fan base, Conley struggled, scoring 15 points on 5-for-19 shooting. Mitchell led the Jazz with 29 points and nine rebounds. Gobert had 23 points and 17 rebounds, while Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points. But despite a tight game, particularly down the stretch, it was hard to avoid not recognizing the Grizzlies point guard past facing the franchise point guard of the future. They show that support for me already, Morant said when asked about the crowds love of Conley. Obviously, its different with him. Hes a legend here, but I appreciate Mike. TIP-INS Jazz: G Dante Exum was part of the active roster for the game, but did not play. Exum has not played since Jan. 5, rehabbing a partially torn patellar tendon. ... Gobert had his seventh double-double of the season. He also had a season-best five blocks. ... Mitchell has reached at least 20 points in 10 of Utahs first 12 games. Grizzlies: The three games in the Grizzlies winning streak have come by four, two and one point. ... Jae Crowder had 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... All of Kyle Andersons 13 points came in the first half. ... Rookie F Brandon Clarke had 10 points, making five of his seven shots. He has reached double-figure scoring in nine of his first 11 games. ... Memphis is 5-1 when making at least 10 3-pointers. WELCOME BACK, MIKE As expected, Conley was given a heros welcome upon returning to the city where he started his career and played 12 seasons, leaving as the franchise leader in points, 3-pointers made, assists, steals and games played. The night included a first-quarter tribute video to the player known in Memphis as The Conductor. I didnt know what to do ... I had to watch it. Conley said. It was tough. My teammates were waiting for me to cry. It was a weird situation. Donovan Mitchell, when asked about the video, said: I almost cried for him. That was pretty special. TANDEM ALLEY-OOP In the second quarter, Grizzlies forward Jae Crowder threw a lob toward the basket that appeared headed to Jaren Jackson Jr. But as Jackson went up, Morant came streaking along the baseline from the left and stole the dunk. It wasnt on purpose, Morant said. I was just running and pointing for the lob and Jae threw it. I was just going to dunk the lob and Jaren jumped too. I mean, somebody had to finish that play, and we couldnt let it be a turnover or something.","401160812"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  As coach Scott Brooks rattled off the things he was happy about in Washingtons 137-116 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night -- Moritz Wagners best game in the NBA, improved defense in the second half -- he didnt even mention Bradley Beals second straight 44-point performance until he was prompted. I forgot about Brad, Brooks said. Hes a stud. He brings it every night. The Wizards have grown accustomed to Beal carrying the load on offense, as he did once again on 15-of-22 shooting. It was the third 40-point outburst this season for the All-Star guard, who has topped 30 five times in his last seven games. It was Wagners big game, though, that helped set the tone for Washington. Wagner came off the bench to add 30 points and 15 rebounds -- both career highs. He became the first reserve in NBA history to have 30 points, 15 boards and four 3-pointers in a game. I just tried to do my job, Wagner said. I tried to talk to (my teammates) in a positive way. Im working on that every day, kind of stay within the game and not let distractions distract me. The things Wagner did on the defensive end were the talk of Washingtons postgame locker room. The second-year center drew three charges to help spark the Wizards defense in the first half. Those are energy boosts, Beal said. Those are smart plays, getting Karl-Anthony Towns in foul trouble and trying to make it difficult and frustrating guys. Hes really good at that. Wagner and the Wizards dominated Minnesota down low all night. Washington scored 76 points in the paint, a season high. Towns, celebrating his 24th birthday, led the Timberwolves with 36 points. Minnesotas star big man, who missed the first meeting with Washington this season while serving a two-game suspension, scored 19 in the second quarter. Neither team played much defense in the first half, as Washington led 76-73 at halftime. The Wizards held Minnesota to 43 second-half points. Second half came and we continued to not play the defense we wanted to play and we just couldnt match them bucket for bucket, Towns said. And thats why the game got out of hand. The Timberwolves were without leading scorer Andrew Wiggins, who missed the game due to personal reasons. Wiggins was averaging a team-high 25.9 points through the first 11 games of the season. Wiggins had been especially effective over his last six games, averaging 31.6 points. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with him and we did miss him, Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. As the Timberwolves adjusted their lineup in Wiggins absence, point guard Jeff Teague stepped back into the starting five after coming off the bench Wednesday against San Antonio. He had 13 points and 11 assists. TIP-INS Wizards: Entered with the third-worst scoring defense in the NBA, allowing 120 points per game.  The Wizards scored 27 points off 20 Minnesota turnovers, a season high.  Washingtons 38 assists marked a season high. Timberwolves: Saunders didnt know if Wiggins would be available Saturday against Houston. I dont comment necessarily on personal matters, Saunders said. But one thing I will say is family is family, and we are family. Andrew has the time that he needs to deal with any personal matters.  Minnesota transferred two-way player Kelan Martin to the roster. Martin entered late in the first quarter, his second appearance with the Timberwolves this season.  The Wolves were 11 for 37 from 3-point range.","401160813"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  When Danilo Gallinari hit a big 3-pointer in overtime, the crowd roared in support of the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was just like old times. Gallinari scored 28 points to help Oklahoma City beat the Philadelphia 76ers 127-119 on Friday night. Chris Paul had 27 points for the Thunder, who had dropped three of four. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points, and Terrance Ferguson finished with 19. It was the biggest win of the season for a franchise that lost All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George in offseason trades. The sellout Chesapeake Energy Arena crowd of 18,203 backed the Thunder with loud cheering in the fourth quarter and overtime and made it seem, for a night, like nothing had changed in a venue long known as one of the league's loudest places. ""It was amazing,"" Gallinari said. ""These are the moments players live for and these are the moments you want at home. It was great to get them a W."" Gallinari missed a jumper from the top of the key that would have won it at the end of regulation, but he made up for it with seven points in overtime. The Thunder relentlessly attacked the bigger 76ers and outscored them 35-15 at the free-throw line. Oklahoma City shot 53.9% from the field for the night. ""I give our guys credit because I think we tried to play to our identity and tried to do it consistently through four quarters,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Joel Embiid had 31 points and 12 rebounds and Josh Richardson added 28 points for the 76ers, who have lost five of seven. ""We're obviously frustrated,"" forward Tobias Harris said. ""Losing five of seven is not where we want to be. It's early in the season, and right now, we're going to progress and get better and find ways to figure out ways to help each other and help our team and go from there."" Oklahoma City outscored Philadelphia 20-12 in overtime. The Thunder went 5 for 7 from the field and 8 for 8 at the line in the extra period. ""Lots of whistles,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""They called it how they wanted to call it. ... Sometimes, the game is called that way, and that's how it was."" TIP-INS 76ers: Made their first five shots. ... Shot 59.1% in the first quarter to take a 29-24 lead. ... Harris scored 21 points before he fouled out in overtime. G Ben Simmons also fouled out in overtime. He had 16 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. ... Embiid returned after missing a game with soreness in his left knee. Thunder: G Hamidou Diallo sat out with a left knee strain. ... C Nerlens Noel fouled out. He had six points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes. ... Donovan won a coach's challenge for possession with 4:37 remaining in the game and the 76ers leading 96-93. HE SAID IT Brown, on his players fouling with Oklahoma City already in the bonus: ""I think there has to be better awareness on bonus stuff. I think there has to be better discipline of not taking swipes at things when you've got to show your hands. I thought there were some hard luck fouls that might be questionable. But at the end of the day when you look at this, I think it points to free throws."" BOUNCING BACK Gallinari broke out of a mini-slump by shooting 7 for 11 from the field, including a 3-for-5 performance from 3-point range. He also made all 11 of his free throws. Gallinari went 3 for 8 against Indiana in his previous game and missed all three of his 3-pointers. In the game before that, he shot 4 for 17 and made just 2 of 10 3s. STAT LINES Paul had perhaps his best game with the Thunder. He scored 12 points in the fourth quarter to give Oklahoma City a chance.","401160814"
"Draymond Green discusses the difficulties the Warriors have been dealing with regarding losing players to injury so frequently this season. (0:36) SAN FRANCISCO --  Yet another Golden State starter went down with an injury when DAngelo Russell sprained his right thumb, but the Warriors still made mighty Boston work until the waning moments. Jayson Tatum dunked after a jump ball with 1:36 left to put Boston ahead, and the Celtics held off the undermanned Warriors 105-100 on Friday night for their 10th straight win since losing the season opener. An out-of-bounds call initially in Golden States favor went to replay review and was overturned, leading to the jump ball. Kemba Walker hit a 3-pointer with 2:19 to play that pulled Boston to 97-95, then Daniel Theis made one free throw with 1:41 remaining. The Warriors got the ball back with 54.3 seconds left on another overturned replay, but Alec Burks missed a 3 that would have tied it and Walker scored on the other end. Were trying to get better and that starts with just competing, Golden State center Willie Cauley-Stein said. Were taking little steps. Today we had a chance to win it. Russell had 12 points and seven assists but also nine of his teams 19 turnovers before leaving with that aching thumb in the Warriors sixth straight defeat. X-rays were negative and he will have an MRI. Injury-plagued Golden State -- playing without Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson -- faced the NBAs top two teams in consecutive games, losing to the Lakers on the road Wednesday. We played our best defensive game of the year. Thats what really matters, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Burks scored 20 points off the bench, making 11 of 12 free throws as Golden States cast of youngsters nearly pulled off a November upset by outhustling Boston for much of the night, crashing the boards and creating second chances. Jaylen Brown had 22 points and eight rebounds, and Tatum overcame a slow start to score 24 points for the Celtics, who lost Oct. 23 at Philadelphia to start the season before beginning their longest winning streak since 2017. We knew that we were going to get their best shot, Brown said. They came out high intensity, they jumped on us early. As were a young team, were getting used to being the team thats being (chased) and handling that better. The Warriors hung tough until late, keeping the crowd engaged -- something that hasnt always been the case so far given the early struggles for a franchise thats reached five straight NBA Finals. Warriors fans have always appreciated high energy, hustle, toughness, great competition, Kerr said. You could feel it in the building tonight. Our fans really enjoyed watching our guys compete, and thats important. We want people to come into this building and be excited about watching our team. Its been a rough start, but if we can compete that way and play that way were going to win some games and our fans will enjoy what were doing. Boston had four starters reach double figures in scoring after seven players did so in a 140-133 win against Washington on Wednesday. Each team was missing a star player following surgery for a broken left hand: Golden State two-time MVP Curry and Boston forward Gordon Hayward, who missed his third straight game and second since the procedure. TIP-INS Celtics: Brown and Tatum had three steals apiece, while Theis and Marcus Smart had two each. ... Boston shot 7 for 23 in the first quarter and 10 of 22 in the second to lead 52-51 at the break. ... The Celtics won their second straight on Golden States home floor and just their eighth in the last 24. ... It had been nearly 50 years since Boston played in San Francisco, a 116-111 Warriors win on Feb. 21, 1970, at Civic Auditorium. ... Boston is 3-0 vs. the Western Conference and 2-0 on the road. Warriors: Russell had his streak of five straight 20-point games snapped. ... Curry, his hand in a brace, cheered when Golden State won a challenge midway through the third and a foul call on Eric Paschall was overturned. ... C Kevon Looney, who missed the entire preseason and only played briefly in the season opener, will be re-evaluated next Wednesday for a nerve issue that has contributed to his right hamstring injury. C Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) is yet to play and also will be examined again Wednesday, the team said. GOLDEN STATES ROUGH START At 2-11, the Warriors are off to their worst start since beginning 2-16 in 1999-00. The six-game losing streak matches their longest since dropping six in a row from Feb. 5-19, 2013. Golden State dropped to 1-6 at home in new Chase Center. The Warriors are 64-13 at home vs. the Eastern Conference since 2014-15, but 0-2 this season. QUOTEABLE Nobody is preordained to get to play in the finals every year. It just doesnt work that way. We sort of look at it the opposite way in that how lucky weve been to be part of this group over the last for me five years, for Draymond (Green) the last seven years, and have a lot of success. Maybe we were due for a year like this. Thats kind of how life works, so lets make the most of it. -- Kerr on Green being the Warriors last healthy superstar.","401160815"
"LOS ANGELES --  After just 12 games together, Anthony Davis and LeBron James already know how to share the workload in their formidable partnership. Davis struggled to find his offensive game against Sacramento, so James did most of the heavy lifting with 29 points and 11 assists. But when the Lakers needed a big defensive play at the buzzer, Davis got both hands around it. James hit two free throws with 5.5 seconds to play, and Davis blocked Harrison Barnes' driving shot at the buzzer with two hands to end Los Angeles' 99-97 victory over former coach Luke Walton and the Kings on Friday night. Davis had only 17 points in his second lowest-scoring performance for the Lakers, but he came through late to seal their 10th win in 11 games. Davis had little rhythm with the ball in his hands, so James consciously took the lead on offense while Davis waited for the chance to back him up. ""It definitely increases my mindset defensively,"" said Davis, who sat out the previous game to rest his sore right shoulder. ""When the shot's not falling, I try to do the other things to help the team win."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 12 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter of the Western Conference-leading Lakers' third straight win despite a spirited effort by the undermanned Kings. The Lakers led 95-90 with three minutes left after Caldwell-Pope's third 3-pointer, but Bogdan Bogdanovic scored five straight points to tie it. James hit a layup with 1:50 left, but Bogdanovic eventually replied with a tying layup with 22 seconds to play. Barnes fouled James on the perimeter, and the shaky free-throw shooter smoothly hit both of his shots. Barnes then tried to drive for a tying shot, but Davis got his fourth block of the night in two-handed style while the Kings hoped in vain for a foul call on moderate contact. ""We played it to perfection,"" James said. ""When you have a shot-blocker the caliber of (Davis) protecting the rim, that just makes it that much tougher on Harrison."" Buddy Hield had 21 points and eight rebounds, and Bogdanovic added 18 points for the Kings in the LA return of Walton, who was fired by the Lakers last April after presiding over three consecutive losing seasons. ""One call changed the whole game, you know,"" said Hield, who appeared to be furious with the no-call at the buzzer. ""Could have gone either way. It be like that sometimes when the home team is favored all the time, especially when you're in LA. ... We've got something good going here, but this game, we should have won. I think we just got it stolen away from us."" Sacramento nearly pulled off the upset despite playing without De'Aaron Fox, who missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle, and Trevor Ariza, who sat out with a sore groin. ""We had some open looks we didn't knock down, but that is a big, talented team, and I thought our guys were light on numbers,"" Walton said. ""We had to put guys in that hadn't played much at all, and everyone that checked in fought and competed."" POSTER QUALITY James posted the highlight of the night in the second quarter with a drive and a high-flying dunk right on top of Nemanja Bjelica, who had regrettably tried to draw a charge. ""(James) saw a lane and put it on his head,"" Davis said. ""That's what LeBron does."" LUKE'S RETURN Walton's pregame introduction was greeted with an indistinguishable mix of boos and cheers of ""Luuuuuke"" for the coach who took over the Lakers in 2016. The former Lakers forward's teams posted three straight improved records, but his performance wasn't rated highly by former Lakers boss Magic Johnson or by general manager Rob Pelinka, who fired Walton just five days after Magic's surprise resignation last April. ""This is why this job is fun,"" Walton said. ""It's fun, it's stressful, it's hard, but this is what you, as a competitor, you love to do. And to be back in your old building and playing against the team you used to coach and play for, it's exciting."" TIP-INS Kings: Cory Joseph scored two points on 1-for-9 shooting in 23 minutes during his second start for the Kings. ... Ariza had treatment and painkilling shots over the past 24 hours, but the Kings decided to hold him out. ... Richaun Holmes scored nine of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. Lakers: Alex Caruso scored a season-high 10 points for the Lakers while playing extra minutes in place of injured starter Avery Bradley, who is out for at least a week with a hairline fracture in his right leg. Bradley got hurt Nov. 3 at San Antonio, but played four more games in pain before the injury was diagnosed. ... Caldwell-Pope started in Bradley's spot and went 1 for 4 in the first three quarters before he found his shot. Caruso started 1 for 6, but got back-to-back layups in the third quarter on passes from James.","401160816"
"CHICAGO --  Spencer Dinwiddie isnt trying to be Kyrie Irving. Still, he gave the Brooklyn Nets the spark they needed Saturday night. Dinwiddie scored 24 points and the Nets beat the Chicago Bulls 117-111 without Irving. Irving entered Saturday sixth in the NBA with 28.5 points per game but sat with a right shoulder injury. Brooklyn was just fine without the All-Star guard as Dinwiddie stepped into the starting lineup. Im not Kyrie, you know what I mean? Dinwiddie said. I just tried to gauge what needed to be done to win the game. Zach LaVine scored 36 points, but Chicago shot 35.2% from the field, 23.1% from 3-point range and committed 20 turnovers. Joe Harris had 22 points and eight assists for Brooklyn, which snapped a three-game skid. The short-handed Nets are also without Caris LeVert, whos recovering from right thumb surgery. Fifteen guys bonded together, and I dont think it was pretty, Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. Your best players out -- lets be honest -- and everybody steps it up a level. Its really a real boost to our morale. The lead changed hands five times in the fourth, and Brooklyn pulled ahead for good on Dinwiddies dunk with 8:01 remaining. Dinwiddie scored 20 points in the fourth alone. He took over, Atkinson said. Chicago briefly got within three points with just under 3 minutes left, and Lauri Markkanen hit a fading 3-pointer to make it 113-111 with 8.8 seconds remaining. But Harris made two free throws and the Bulls never got the ball with a chance to tie it. Wendell Carter Jr. added 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Bulls, who trailed by double digits early before using a 23-5 run in the second quarter to take the lead. Chicago led from then until the fourth quarter but allowed 43 points in the final period. They just wanted it more than us, LaVine said. They made more plays to close out the third quarter and start the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Atkinson said Irvings status for Mondays game against Indiana is unclear.  Six Nets scored in double figures. Bulls: Coach Jim Boylen said he expects F Otto Porter Jr.s return from a left foot sprain to be a matter of weeks, rather than months. He doesnt think Porter will need surgery. Ottos is a slow, meticulous process, Boylen said. BRICK CITY Brooklyn won despite shooting worse than 25% from 3-point range for the second straight game. The Nets shot 23.3% from beyond the arc after making just 21.1% at Denver on Thursday. Dinwiddie missed all four of his 3-point attempts. Ive been broke from 3 this year, so (Im) probably dragging our average down, Dinwiddie said. HEADED HOME The Nets finished their five-game road trip on a high note. Brooklyn had lost three of four to start the stretch and blew a 12-point halftime lead in Denver on Thursday. Last game of the road trip, we all know how difficult those games are, Atkinson said. We avoided that super bad stretch that weve had in the past two or three games, where we just have a train wreck of an eight minutes or a quarter that doesnt go right.","401160817"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Giannis Antetokounmpo rarely makes three 3-pointers in a game. Even on his way to the MVP award last season, the Milwaukee Bucks' 6-foot-11 superstar reached that mark only six times. He did it Saturday night in a 102-83 rout of the Indiana Pacers, finishing with 26 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. ""I think he's getting more and more comfortable with the 3-ball,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""The ball's in his hands a lot, so he's shooting them off the dribble. He continues to attack at a high rate, so we just want him to keep growing, keep letting it fly."" A shaky long-range shooter who was only 25.6% on 3s in the 2018-19 campaign, Antetokounmpo is 16 of 50 -- 32% -- from behind the arc in the Bucks' 9-3 start. With length and speed that make him almost unstoppable going to the basket, Antetokounmpo hopes to force defenders to respect the threat of a 3. ""I haven't seen it yet,"" he said. ""Eventually it might change, or it might not. Pretty much wide-open every shot I take from the top of the key or the wing."" His 3 from the top of the key at the first-quarter buzzer Saturday gave Milwaukee a 26-22 lead and set the tone on a night the Pacers endured their worst shooting performance of the season. Brook Lopez, who had 15 points and eight boards, blocked five shots to help limit Indiana to a season-low 32% from the field. Malcolm Brogdon, after joining Indiana in a July sign-and-trade deal with Milwaukee, missed his first chance at facing his former team. The early All-Star candidate developed a sore back during Friday's 111-102 loss at Houston. The good news for Indiana was the return of Myles Turner. Playing his first game since Oct. 30, Turner had 16 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks. ""I really don't know how to answer that,"" Turner said when asked if any pain lingers from his right ankle sprain. ""I'm still battling a little bit, but I felt good enough to play. That's all that matters."" The Bucks shot 45%. They went ahead by 15 points in the second quarter. Indiana then cut its 49-36 halftime deficit to 71-63 entering the fourth quarter. The Bucks restored their lead by opening the final period on a 10-2 run, including a pair of spot-up 3-pointers from Sterling Brown in the left corner. Brown finished with 10 points and six rebounds, complementing Donte DiVinzenco (14 points) and Eric Bledsoe (10 points, five assists). The only drama thereafter was that Antetokounmpo's run of consecutive 30-point, 10-rebound games ended at six. It was the NBA's longest such streak since Shaquille O'Neal's 11 in 2001. Budenholzer credited Indiana for playing hard ""no matter who's out there for them."" Backup point guard T.J. McConnell (sore right groin) was a late scratch, joining Brogdon, All-Star Victor Oladipo and sixth man Jeremy Lamb on Indiana's crowded inactive list. ""We're just having some bad breaks,"" coach Nate McMillan said. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo drew oohs and ahs on a highlight-reel dunk early in the second quarter. He started out dribbling beyond the 3-point line, drove left around JaKarr Sampson, picked up the ball above the foul line and soared for a left-handed jam over the outstretched arms of the trailing Sampson and help defender Goga Bitadze. ... Starting small forward Khris Middleton (left thigh contusion) missed his second straight game. Pacers: The Pacers were outscored 34-6 in the paint in the first half and 56-26 for the game. ... The team's video board showed Travis Best in attendance. Best averaged 8.9 points as the backup point guard on the Pacers' 2000 Eastern Conference championship team.","401160818"
"NEW YORK --  Another night, another late 3-pointer to win for the Charlotte Hornets. First, it was Malik Monk heaving a 26-footer to edge Detroit. It was Devonte' Graham's turn Saturday. Graham made his ninth 3-pointer of the game with 2.8 seconds remaining, finishing with 29 points to lead the Hornets to a 103-102 victory over the New York Knicks. The second-year player was just 2 for 12 from long distance Friday. ""I'm real confident in my shot. Worked on it a lot this summer,"" Graham said. ""My teammates telling to keep shooting it. Just knowing that they have that confidence in me, it would be selfish of me to pass up shots when they find me wide open."" After making a good defensive play that gave the Hornets the chance to either tie or win it, P.J. Washington, who scored 19 points, got the ball in front of the Knicks logo near midcourt with 6 seconds remaining. He made a routine bounce pass to Graham, who came in charging from the opposite half of the court. New York's Frank Ntilikina went to switch on Washington but raced back to cover Graham as the shot was hoisted up and sank through. ""It's a play we have executed before,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""You know, it's a type of play we executed in practice, we talk about and draw up and give our guys a lot of credit. In the heat of the battle they executed."" Terry Rozier had 16 and Marvin Williams added 13 off the bench for the Hornets, who got off to another slow start before picking it up when it most mattered. RJ Barrett scored 22 points and Mitchell Robinson had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who were coming off a victory over Dallas on Thursday. ""You never want to lose any game, but especially when you got a solid lead. But give them credit,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""They turned up their defense on us and they really shot the heck out of that 3 ball. I mean, 17 for 48 from 3. That's pretty impressive. And obviously the last one was the backbreaker."" Charlotte was down by 15 in the third quarter before taking the lead to start the final period on Graham's 3 for a 78-76 advantage. He then hit the final basket. For a second Ntilikina thought it would be Monk repeating the previous night's heroics before the ball found Graham's hands. ""He was (the) hot scorer,"" Ntilikina said. ""It was expected that (they would) draw a play for him."" TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte won at Detroit on Friday on Monk's winning 3-pointer after losing at Memphis on Ja Morant's layup with 0.7 seconds left. . Graham's previous career high for 3-pointers in a game was six against Minnesota on Oct. 25. Knicks: Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis scored 14 points apiece. . New York dropped to 1-4 at home. COULD'VE BEEN A KNICK Many figured Rozier to New York was a safe bet after the team missed out on signing Kyrie Irving. Instead, Charlotte signed Rozier to a three-year, $58 million deal and the Knicks settled for Elfrid Payton, who signed a two-year deal for $15 million and has not played since the fourth game of the season due to a strained right hamstring. ""For a second, I thought this was the place. I thought I was going to be a Knick,"" Rozier said. Rozier, who spent the first four years of his career in Boston and was vocal about seeking a higher role last season, is averaging career highs of 17 points, 4.9 assists and 42 percent shooting from the field. ""Other things happened and I ended up going to Charlotte,"" he said. ""It was the interest they showed in me. That was big. The organization believed in me. Why not?"" FRIENDS FOREVER Former Knick Willy Hernangomez wasn't too happy with the treatment the Madison Square Garden fans gave Kristaps Porzingis in his first game back in New York on Thursday. The former first-round pick, who was traded to Dallas last January, was booed during the lineup introductions and jeered even louder each time he missed touched the ball and missed a shot. Hernangomez, a former Knick himself who played his first NBA two seasons in New York before moving on to Charlotte, believes his close friend was deserving of a better welcoming. ""KP knows what happened and everything. The people just see what is public,"" Hernangomez said. ""But people can do whatever they want, support, boo, whatever. I just feel sad because KP is my brother and he did a lot for this city, the community, the team.""","401160819"
"MIAMI --  There were calls that Miami coach Erik Spoelstra didnt like. Just not many of them. The Heat set a franchise record by fouling only six times, Jimmy Butler shook off a pregame illness to flirt with a triple-double and Miami remained unbeaten at home by beating the undermanned New Orleans Pelicans 109-95 on Saturday night. They let us play, Spoelstra said. But then if there was any slightest infraction of a step or a travel or a dribble, they called all those. But I actually liked that we didnt let that get in the way. Kendrick Nunn scored 22 points, Bam Adebayo had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Butler added 16 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds for the Heat. Miami is 5-0 at home and 9-3 overall -- tying the best 12-game start in team history. Nickell Alexander-Walker made six 3-pointers and had 27 points for New Orleans, while ETwaun Moore scored 18 and Jrue Holiday scored 14 for the Pelicans. New Orleans came into the game with big injury problems -- and left with bigger ones. No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, along with JJ Redick, Jahlil Okafor, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Darius Miller all were unavailable for the game with various injuries. And by the time the first quarter was over, starters Frank Jackson and Derrick Favors were done for the night as well. Jackson left with pain on the left side of his neck after colliding with Miamis Meyers Leonard. Favors departed with back spasms. And that left the Pelicans with eight players for the games final 40 minutes. They hung tough, but the Heat eventually pulled away. I thought the guys played extremely hard, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. We just ran out of gas, to be honest with you. We just did not have enough people tonight. Nunn led Miami in scoring. His best play of the night might have been a pass. The sequence in the final seconds of the third quarter went like this: Kelly Olynyk double-teamed Holiday, forcing the ball from his hands. The Pelicans turned it over a couple seconds later, and Miamis Tyler Herro pushed the ball upcourt to Nunn near the basket. Nunn knew he couldnt get a shot off, so he kicked it out to Duncan Robinson for a 3-pointer that swished for a 78-65 lead as time expired. Just IQ, Nunn said. When you run the floor, know where your guys are at. And we made a great play. Robinson scored 15, Olynyk had 13 and Herro finished with 12 for Miami. TIP-INS Pelicans: The injuries are a huge reason for this, but the loss means New Orleans (3-9) matched the fourth-worst 12-game start in franchise history. They were 1-11 in 2004-05, 1-11 in 2015-16 and 2-10 in 2016-17. ... New Orleans was outrebounded 46-31. Heat: Miamis previous record for fouls in a game was nine, done twice. Miami committed only one foul in the first half, a franchise low for any half and the first one-foul half in the NBA since Houston had one in the first 24 minutes against Chicago on March 27, 2018. The previous Heat low for fouls in a half was two, done on five occasions. ... The Heat played without Justise Winslow (concussion), Goran Dragic (illness), KZ Okpala (Achilles), Dion Waiters (suspended) and Derrick Jones Jr. (left hip). WAITERS SPEAKS Waiters is in Syracuse this weekend, seeing the Orange play and seeking counsel from his college coach Jim Boeheim. One thing about Syracuse, whatever youre going through, the love is unconditional, Waiters told Syracuse.com. Waiters did not specifically address the Heat suspension, and will be away from the team until at least Nov. 30. AILING DUKIES There was a Duke alumni event for fans at the game Saturday night. They just didnt get to see one on the court. With Jacksons injury, it meant all six players from Duke on the rosters were done for the night. Williamson, Redick, Okafor, Ingram and Jackson are the Blue Devils on New Orleans roster, and Miami has Winslow. SERIES LEADERS Miami leads the series with the Pelicans 23-22 -- including playoffs. The regular-season series is tied 19-19.","401160820"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Undermanned and playing for the second consecutive night, the Houston Rockets still had plenty of reason to be confident. ""I would think it would give you confidence,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""You're playing with a bazooka out there."" A bazooka named James Harden. Harden unloaded Saturday night, scoring 49 points on a whopping 41 shots from the field to lead the short-handed Rockets to their seventh straight victory, 125-105 over the Minnesota Timberwolves. With Russell Westbrook resting and several key contributors injured, the Rockets needed Harden to shoulder an even bigger scoring load than usual. The 41 attempts are the most in his career, and the most in the NBA this season, surpassing the 37 Golden State's D'Angelo Russell took in an overtime loss Nov. 8 in the same building in Minnesota. ""It was a collective effort,"" Harden said. ""We've got six, seven guys out. So it could have been an easy game, where we just chalked it up and got ready for next game. We wanted to come here and win this game, and we showed it."" Harden made 16 of the 41 shots, going 8-for-22 from 3-point range. He was 9-of-11 on free throws. ""He scored [49] on 41 shots,"" Timberwolves forward Robert Covington said. ""That's what we want. But it's just the other guys hurt us. We followed the game plan with him."" Ben McLemore scored 20 points. Undrafted rookie Chris Clemons scored a career-high 19 off the bench for the Rockets, who broke open the game with a 9-0 run in the fourth quarter. Austin Rivers also scored 19 points. In addition to Westbrook, the Rockets were without center Clint Capela, guards Eric Gordon and Gerald Green and forward Danuel House Jr. And they were playing the second game of a back-to-back following Friday night's win over Indiana in Houston. ""There was a lot of heart,"" D'Antoni said. ""I think that's what we're more excited about, just the heart and the effort and what went into playing a back-to-back. That's a character win."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who also were short-handed. Andrew Wiggins missed his second consecutive game for personal reasons. Jake Layman made his first start of the season for Minnesota and scored a season-high 21 points. Covington had 17 points. ""I'm a no-excuse person,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Who's on the court is on the court. But we have to do more things to make teams like that uncomfortable. James Harden is a heck of a player. He's one of the best scorers you'll ever see. And he took 41 shots. I thought we made him work for some of them. But some of them, we didn't."" Harden scored 18 of his 30 first-half points in the first quarter. It was his highest-scoring first quarter of the season. Harden took 17 of his team's first 25 shots. He and the Rockets led by two at halftime despite trailing by as many as 11. ""We can't take any game for granted,"" Harden said. ""We showed that tonight. I think the first half we gave up too many points. Second half we locked back in. They barely got over 100 points. That's pretty much the goal every single game. Guys didn't look around. We manned up and got a win."" TIP-INS Rockets: Isaiah Hartenstein had a career-high 16 rebounds. The Rockets have held a double figure lead in 12 of 13 games this season. Nene also missed the game with a left adductor strain. Timberwolves: Guard Josh Okogie did not play because of left knee soreness. Guard Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain) remained out. First-round pick Jarrett Culver scored 13 points off the bench. The most points scored by a Minnesota opponent is 55 by San Antonio's Tony Parker in a double-overtime game on Nov. 5, 2008. INSTANT OFFENSE Clemons has played in seven of the 12 games this season. But he's used to scoring in bunches. He led the nation in scoring at 30.1 points per game as a senior at Campbell. He finished his career with the third-most points in NCAA Division I history. Saturday, the Rockets were plus-32 with Clemons on the court. ""He knows what he does, and he's very confident,"" D'Antoni said. ""We know he can shoot and all that, but his defense is good and he works hard. It was good. He's earned it.""","401160821"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic was upset when he missed four of 12 free throws in the first three quarters of Saturday nights game against Toronto. Then, he went 7 for 7 from the line in the fourth quarter as Dallas built on its one-point lead and the Mavericks went on to beat the Raptors 110-102. I dont expect to make all of them, but I want to make all of them, Doncic said Doncic finished with 26 points and 15 rebounds, including a career-best 15 free throws in a career-high 19 attempts. (Doncic) can do it all, said guard Fred VanVleet, who scored 24 points for Toronto. Hes a threat at every level, mid-range and 3, and kicking out to his teammates. Thought we did a good job on him tonight, just couldnt keep him off the free throw line. Raptors coach Nick Nurse seemed tired of seeing Doncic at the line. I thought that he got all his points from the foul line. I thought he was treated very well tonight, Nurse said Delon Wright finished with 15 points and banked in a fadeaway jumper with 5 seconds left in the third quarter to send Dallas into the fourth quarter with a 78-77 edge. Wright added six points against his former team in the fourth quarter. Kristaps Porzingis had 20 points and matched his career best with 15 rebounds for Dallas. I felt much more comfortable today, he said. It felt more natural today, not as forced. I just missed a lot of good looks, a lot of open shots, but Im happy we got the win. If I scored a few more of those open looks, it could have been a much easier game for us. Seth Curry scored 15 points, and Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber had 10 apiece. Doncic noted Klebers contribution on defense in a win over the defending NBA champions. A great win, Doncic said. We did a great job on Pascal Siakam. Maxi did a great job especially. Siakam, Torontos leading scorer, had 15 points on 10-for-24 shooting. Norman Powell led the Raptors with a season-high 26 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter. Matt Thomas scored 10. The Mavericks used a 15-0 run in the first quarter to transform a 10-3 deficit into an 18-10 lead. Kleber scored the first five points, and Finney-Smith ended the run with a layup 3 minutes later. Dallas led 32-22 after the first quarter, with Doncic scoring 14 points. VanVleet had 10 for Toronto, which shot 30% (6 for 20) from the floor. The Raptors roared back in the second quarter, shooting 61% (14 for 23) and outscoring the Mavericks 38-21 for a 60-53 halftime lead. TIP-INS Raptors: In Matt Thomass ninth NBA game, he scored a career-high 10 points, all in the second quarter. He had scored eight twice before. ... Norman Powell had a chance for a 4-point play in the fourth quarter, but he missed the free throw after Dallass Jalen Brunson fouled him on the shot. Mavericks: A video review showed that a shot by Kristaps Porzingis in the second quarter left his hand after 24 seconds expired, so 2 points were deducted from the scoreboard. ... The game matched the NBAs fifth-leading scorer Luka Doncic (28.7ppg.) and eighth-leading scorer Pascal Siakam (27.2 ppg.). TOUGH STRETCH The Mavericks are on a homestand that consists of games against the four teams -- Raptors, Spurs, Warriors and Cavaliers -- that have won the last six NBA titles. This is a tough homestand, coach Rick Carlisle said. Its a great opportunity, certainly, to be home. Well find out a lot. I dont know exactly what it will tell me or us, but the opportunity to compete at home in front of your fans, its a big deal and its a big opportunity. MISSING YOU The Raptors went 3-2 on a five-game trip, even though C Serge Ibaka (sprained right ankle) and G Kyle Lowry (thumb injury), averaging 35 points per game between them, were injured in the second game. Three-and-two and we lost two of our most important players, said Norman Powell, who took Lowrys place. Were not holding our heads though. Were going to get in the gym and do better, correct our mistakes.","401160822"
"SAN ANTONIO -- Tim Duncan was back in charge in San Antonio, and the Spurs were flourishing under his leadership again. Duncan was directing players on defensive assignments, encouraging them and providing needed leadership. But in the end, he couldn't provide the same late-game heroics from the bench that he long did on the court. CJ McCollum scored 32 points and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Spurs 121-116 on Saturday night to spoil Duncan's first shot at coaching following Gregg Popovich's ejection. Duncan took over just 13 games into his first season as an assistant coach. Popovich was asked if he considered having Becky Hammon take over to make history as the first woman to lead an NBA team. ""I'm not here to make history,"" Popovich said. LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and 13 rebounds, but the Spurs lost their fifth straight and fell to 5-8. Damian Lillard added 22 points and Hassan Whiteside had 21 points for Portland (5-8), which rallied from a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter to snap a four-game skid in San Antonio. ""We've blown leads before, so we kind of know what to expect,"" McCollum said. ""Once you do it, you've got to stay grounded, focus on the little stuff."" Before the game, Popovich said coaching could only go so far and it was up to each player to take responsibility for his own mistakes and performance during this losing streak. Popovich put that responsibility squarely on the Spurs when he was ejected early in the third quarter. Popovich was ejected after walking onto the court to berate official Jason Goldenberg over a non-call. Popovich calmly walked off the court following his first ejection of the season. Duncan, Hammon and Will Hardy coached by committee, but it was Duncan calling the plays and yelling out instruction. ""It was cool,"" Spurs guard Bryn Forbes said. ""It didn't really feel like a huge difference. I think he did a good job. He took control. He helped lead us to a big lead."" San Antonio took a 111-104 lead with 4 minutes remaining but couldn't hold on. Portland took a 114-111 lead on Rodney Hood's three-point play on a left-handed hook and foul on DeMar DeRozan. DeRozan was later called for a charge against Hood that was changed to a pushing foul after a coaching challenge by the Spurs. The Blazers took a 116-113 lead with 37 seconds following the review. DeRozan was still upset by the call after the game, stating Hood hit him in the face prior to any possible push off. ""As soon as we say something out on the court, we get a tech,"" DeRozan said. ""We're held responsible for things we say about the refs, but when refs cost us the game, I don't know what we get. An apology later on after it's reviewed?"" After trailing by 23 points in the opening minute of the second quarter, the Spurs went on a 34-15 run capped by Aldridge's sixth 3-pointer. Aldridge had 10 3-pointers last season. The Spurs stormed to a 96-90 lead late in the third quarter behind a series of energy plays that drew thunderous cheers from the previously restrained crowd. ""We've got to play the way we played after Pop got kicked out the full game,"" DeRozan said. ""Fighting against bad calls, so many things out there, we just listened, went out there and played hard."" Bryn Forbes added 17 points and DeRozan and Rudy Gay added 16 apiece. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland's bench had 25 points led by eight each from Mario Hezonja and Kent Bazemore. ... The Blazers lost 113-110 in San Antonio on Oct. 28 when Lillard's 3-pointer at the buzzer rattled out of the rim. Spurs: The Spurs entered the season with a losing record for only 65 days since 1998. ... Aldridge's career high for 3-pointers is 37, set in 2015, and his highest 3-point percentage is 41%, set in 2017. MUSCLE MELO Lillard and McCollum both reached out to Carmelo Anthony after he agreed to sign with the Trail Blazers. Anthony has not played since Nov. 8, 2018, with the Houston Rockets, but he spent the past summer working out with McCollum and others. ""He looks like he's changed his body a little bit,"" McCollum said. ""Started lifting more on his legs, his lower half. He was dunking this summer. He doesn't usually dunk, so that's how I knew he was feeling good. I don't know if it was because of the work or because he's been off or a combination, but he looked like he had new life, more bounce in his step.""","401160823"
"Paul George continues to show out in his first home game in LA and celebrates another 3-pointer with a Jordan-like shrug. (0:22) LOS ANGELES --  Paul George made history in his Clippers home debut even though he considered it mere practice after missing the first 11 games of the season. George scored 37 points in 20 minutes, becoming the first NBA player to score that many in fewer than 21 minutes, and Los Angeles led all the way in routing the Atlanta Hawks 150-101 on Saturday night. ""He knows I had him on a time limit, so he's trying to get it all in,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. It was the Clippers' largest margin of victory ever and their total points scored were the second-most in franchise history. ""We had another 30, 40 points that didn't play tonight,"" George said, referring to Kawhi Leonard. The anticipated first game with George and Leonard in the lineup together didn't happen when Leonard sat out with a left knee contusion. But the Clippers didn't need both of their new superstars on a night when George tied his career high with six 3-pointers and made all 11 of his free throws. ""It's a dream come true to be able to do this at home in front of family and friends,"" said George, who is from Palmdale, north of Los Angeles. ""I'm just happy to be playing basketball again."" George was clearly having fun in the fourth when he stole the ball, dribbled down and tossed it off the glass, setting up Montrezl Harrell for a two-handed dunk that ignited the crowd and pushed the Clippers' lead to 36 points. ""This is practice for me to get in time with my guys and a catch a rhythm out there,"" said George, who spent the first couple weeks of the season rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgeries. ""I got new shoulders. They haven't felt this healthy in a long time."" George started the fourth quarter and hit a 3-pointer, having asked to accumulate more minutes since the team has had little practice time lately. But when George tripped, Rivers had seen enough and removed him. It wasn't soon enough for the Hawks. ""You saw a guy step out on the court that had no rust,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Two nights after scoring 33 in his debut at New Orleans, George scored 15 of the Clippers' first 22 points in a six-minute span. They led by 17 and shot 59 percent in the opening quarter. George is the first player in franchise history to score 30-plus points in his first two games with the team. The Hawks scored 11 straight to close within four early in the second quarter, the closest they would come the rest of the game. The Clippers answered with an 18-6 run, fueled by George's nine points, to go back up by 17 again. George had 25 points at halftime when the Clippers led 74-62, shooting 52% and making all 16 of their free throws. Leonard also sat out on Thursday when George made his Clippers debut in a loss to the Pelicans. Trae Young had 20 points for the Hawks, who dropped their second in a row. They trailed by 52 points in the fourth. ""It was just bad effort,"" Young said, ""and you can't do it in this league or you'll get killed every night."" The Clippers dominated in nearly every category, with their bench outscoring the Hawks' reserves 81-35. Los Angeles made 17 3-pointers and hit 33 of 35 free throws.

"CLEVELAND --  The Philadelphia 76ers made certain there was no late drama against the Cleveland Cavaliers this time. A few days after a one-point victory over the Cavaliers at home, the 76ers jumped ahead early and steadily built the lead for a 114-95 rout Sunday. Cleveland nearly pulled off an upset in Philadelphia on Tuesday before falling 98-97, but the 76ers quickly ended any hope of a repeat. Tobias Harris scored 27 points and Joel Embiid had 14. Ben Simmons had 10 points and 11 assists, and the 76ers had six players score in double figures. Philadelphia went ahead midway through the first quarter and pulled away, shooting 67% in the half. The lead reached 75-44 early in the third quarter. ""We needed a win and we came out with great energy and used our defense to fuel everything,"" said Harris, who played with a jammed left pinky. ""When you get high-percentage shots and play good defense, it's a good combination."" The 76ers had dropped five of seven going into the game, including losses in Orlando and Oklahoma City, but finished their road trip on a high note. ""How people respond to losing and how they play is an interesting snapshot,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""For the most part, the guys didn't let up. Defensively, we came out with a sting. The partnership of all the pieces was effective."" Philadelphia shredded Cleveland's defense with 33 assists on 46 baskets. Harris was 12 of 14 from the field, missing only one of 12 2-point attempts. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love took a hard fall after being flattened by Furkan Korkmaz while shooting in the lane in the first quarter. Love, who injured his right knee, got up after being on the floor for a couple of moments and gave the thumbs-up sign to the crowd. Love, who scored 12 points in 25 minutes, expects to play Monday night when the Cavaliers visit New York. ""My knee was bent all the way and when I hit the floor all that weight kind of jammed up on me,"" he said. ""It's going to pretty sore tomorrow. Nothing serious. I'm going to have to treat it a lot. Hopefully it will be gone in a few days."" Collin Sexton had 17 points for Cleveland, which has lost three straight and opened a stretch of five games in seven days. The Cavaliers were ahead of the 76ers by five points late in Tuesday's game, but couldn't hold the lead. Love missed an open 3-pointer on the final possession. ""This isn't just a tough loss like it was in Philly, where we competed,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""We got blown out in our own arena on a Sunday afternoon in front of a great crowd. It measures you a little bit."" Brown is looking forward to the 76ers playing 13 of their next 18 at home. ""How can that not be fantastic?"" he said.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Boston Celtics were an unlucky bounce away from extending an historic start to their season. Instead, the Sacramento Kings walked away with a huge victory. Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points, Richaun Holmes hit two free throws with 13.3 seconds remaining to give Sacramento the lead, and the Kings snapped the Celtics' 10-game winning streak with a 100-99 victory Sunday. Marcus Smart had a chance to win it for Boston, but his runner in the lane bounced around the rim before trickling off as the buzzer sounded. ""The ball just felt like it sat on the rim forever,'' Smart said. ""I thought it was going in. I think everybody thought it was going in and it just rolled out. It was just one of those games.'' The Celtics (10-2) lost for the first time since their Oct. 23 opener at Philadelphia. The only other team in NBA history to drop its opener and then rattle off 10 consecutive wins was the 1979-80 Milwaukee Bucks. Harrison Barnes had 13 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 12 points and 10 assists for the Kings (5-7), who lost a similarly close game two nights earlier to the Lakers in Los Angeles. Hield hit seven 3-pointers and finished just two points off his career high. But Kings coach Luke Walton was most fired up about Hield's defense on a day Sacramento held Boston to 42% shooting (34-for-82) and just 18 points in the first quarter. ""Buddy obviously was spectacular,'' Walton said. ""We all know he can score, and he's going to have nights like this. But I thought he was so committed to the team winning. The way he was defending, just his all-around game.'' Jaylen Brown scored 18 points and Kemba Walker had 15 for Boston. Jayson Tatum and Daniel Theis each added 14. Down four to start the second half, the Celtics outscored the Kings 29-21 in the third quarter to take a 75-71 advantage entering the fourth. With 13 seconds remaining and Boston up 99-98, Holmes and Smart went to the floor battling for a rebound and Smart was called for a foul that set up Holmes for the free throws. Celtics coach Brad Stevens challenged the foul call but it was upheld upon a replay review. TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum came in having scored 20-plus points in seven of the first 11 games. He had just four over the first three quarters Sunday. In the fourth, he did convert a three-point play and drilled a 3-pointer during a sequence that gave Boston a 93-88 lead. Kings: Before the game, Walton didn't offer much reaction to the NBA announcing that a key foul on Barnes on Friday, which sent LeBron James to the line to sink two free throws that helped the Lakers pull out the win, should have been called an offensive foul on James. ""I don't care, I don't look at it,'' Walton said. ""Our mindset is 'What's next? What are we doing next?''' YOU FORGOT SOMETHING Kings center Dewayne Dedmon checked into the game in the first quarter and took the court, only to realize he hadn't removed his warm-up pants. Dedmon quickly discarded them and enjoyed a nice game off the bench with seven points, four rebounds and a block. BOGDANOVIC'S BIG DAY With point guard De'Aaron Fox out with a severe ankle sprain, Bogdanovic takes on a more crucial role in Sacramento's backcourt. Along with his 12 points and 10 assists, he didn't commit a single turnover in 31 minutes.","401160826"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Markelle Fultz is fitting in nicely with the Orlando Magic. The former No. 1 overall pick had 19 points and the deciding defensive play in a 125-121 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. Nikola Vucevic had 30 points and 17 rebounds and Evan Fournier added 25 points and nine assists, but the Magic nearly squandered an 18-point fourth quarter lead before Fultz stopped Washington's rally. Fultz made all six shots from the field in the first half, including a pair of 3-pointers, and finished 8 for 10 from the field. However, it was his defensive play that decided the game. With Orlando leading 119-116, Fultz stole a pass and was fouled as he dunked the ball with 36.1 seconds left. His free throw finished the 3-point play and gave Orlando a six-point cushion that stood up for the team's fourth win in its last five games. ""That was definitely fun,"" said Fultz, who was drafted No. 1 by Philadelphia 76ers in 2017 before being traded to Orlando midway through last season. ""You live for moments like that when the game is on the line and you're out competing to see what everybody is made of. I love it that I got a chance to make a big-time play and I finished it off."" Orlando needed it to withstand a couple of fourth-quarter rallies by Washington and its 3-point shooting team. The Wizards made 10 of 15 3-pointers in the final period and scored 44 points, but couldn't play enough defense to overtake Orlando. Bradley Beal scored 34 points and had eight assists for Washington, which absorbed its fourth loss in five games. The Wizards got 21 points from C.J. Miles and 15 from Davis Bertans. ""We are 10 games in (to the season) now so we have to dial back the amount of excuses we have,"" Beal said. ""We compete hard enough to win every game. We are top five on offense, so we know that's not the problem. We just have to get stops."" The Magic had to put down two furious rallies from the Wizards in the fourth quarter. Washington was down 95-78 early in the fourth quarter, but closed to within 97-91 on a 3-pointer from Moritz Wagner with 7:23 left in the game The Magic lost both backup point guards, D.J. Augustin (dislocated finger) and Michael Carter-Williams (hip), to injuries in the second quarter, but Fultz picked up the slack. TIP INS Wizards: Washington missed its first seven 3-point attempts. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Jamal Murray didnt take long to erase a bad night against Brooklyn. Murray, who was missed 10 of 11 shots against the Nets last time out, connected on his first four on Sunday en route to a season-high 39 points as the Nuggets dominated the Memphis Grizzlies for a 131-114 victory. It was just preparation, Murray said of the difference. I mean, I know I didnt shoot well (against Brooklyn), so I wanted to bounce back. Start out by being aggressive. Miss or make. Murray added eight assists with no turnovers on the night, while connecting on 14 of 24 shots, including 7 of 12 from 3-point range. Murray didnt play in the fourth quarter after Denver held a 108-80 lead after three. I had a feeling he was going to come out not only being aggressive, but shooting the ball at a high level, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Hes too good of a shooter to continue shooting the way he had been recently. Paul Millsap had 23 points and Juancho Hernangomez finished with 15. Jerami Grant added 12 points as Denver won for the sixth time in the last seven, scoring a season high in points. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 22 points, including a career-high five 3-pointers. Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Brandon Clarke finished with 19 points, including 10 in the fourth quarter when the game was out of reach. A promising start offensively for Memphis, led by Valanciunas, eventually turned as the Nuggets defense tightened. Ja Morants flashy moves in the paint, along with other inside shots by Grizzlies shooters ended up returned by Denver rim protectors. Denvers seven blocks, coupled with nine Memphis turnovers in the first half, translated to a 72-49 Nuggets lead at the half. The major damage came in the second quarter with Denver outscoring Memphis 44-17. They raised their level to an elite level, and our guys just couldnt really catch that second gear. It just wasnt our day, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: We tried to claw back here and there, but that second quarter kind of got away from us. Murray already had 26 points by halftime, and characteristic of a young Memphis team, the Grizzlies simply didnt have the experience to counter the Nuggets burst. Denver would eventually lead by as many as 33. Tonight, they just made shots, said Morant, who had 13 points and six assists to go with four turnovers. The Nuggets had 29 fast-break points to only 10 from Memphis, much of Denvers a result of a defense that recorded 10 blocked shots and forced 16 Grizzlies turnovers leading to 25 points. I think thats a fun way to play when you can play defense, when you can rebound and get out and run before they set their defense, Malone said. When you are running and sharing the ball, it is even that much more fun, so it was great. TIP-INS Nuggets: Gave up 100 points for only the second time in the last seven games.  Will Barton, who was listed as probable after having left adductor tightness against the Nets, started but was limited to six points.  Previous high for points this season was 121 against Atlanta on Nov. 12.  Hernangomez was 5 of 6 from the field, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Had 36 assists, a season high. Grizzlies: Valanciunas has reached double figures in 12 straight games.  Memphis has made at least 10 3-pointers in seven straight games, matching the franchise record set in March of last season.  Entered the game leading the NBA with 55 points in the paint per game. Managed only 40 against the Nuggets. TEAMMATE TRANSLATION Hernangomez, in his fourth season out of Spain, was praised by Malone for the energy he brings to the Nuggets. Malone said the 6-foot-9 forward is contagious with the energy. Hes one of the best teammates Ive ever had, Murray said. Hes always the first one to stand by the bench and clap for his teammates and cheer. Hes always talking, even if he cant talk English.","401160828"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jrue Holiday looked to find J.J. Redick shot opportunities early and often against Golden State, and Reddick validated Holiday's approach in short order. ""I'm looking for him every time,"" said Holiday, who in the first quarter assisted on five Redick jump shots, four of them 3-pointers. ""It's not even if he takes the shot; he attracts so many bodies that he gets other guys shots. ""But when he makes them with like three people on him, it's crazy,"" Holiday continued. ""It's actually really cool to see."" Redick scored 26 points, hitting his sixth 3-pointer of the game from the left corner with 1:09 left, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Warriors 108-100 on Sunday night. ""I'm going into a game with zero expectations and agendas,"" Redick said. ""Some nights it's your night and some nights it's not. ... I'm just going to continue to play my game -- and then they leave me open in the corner."" Holiday had 22 points despite a difficult night shooting the ball and also had nine assists and eight rebounds. Jaxson Hayes had 10 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in the first start of his career. Eric Paschall scored 30 points for injury-depleted Golden State, which has lost seven straight. Ky Bowman scored 19 points and Glenn Robinson III added 14. Draymond Green helped out at point guard but didn't have a good night statistically, finishing with seven points, six rebounds and four assists against three turnovers. ""There are some funky lineups that are out there because of our injuries and we're short on shooting,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""If you can't spread the floor shooting, you've got to be able to play with pace and make all the cuts. You've got to play faster. You have to get stops defensively so you can run. ""I didn't think we did a very good job of making New Orleans guard,"" Kerr added. ""We just kind of took quick shots."" Golden State trailed most of the game, but rallied from a third-quarter deficit as large as 17 to get as close as 77-74 on Marquese Chriss' tomahawk jam over Nicolo Melli. But Holiday -- who shot 4 of 16 through three quarters before making five of his last seven -- responded with free throws, two driving layups and a turnaround fade in succession to push the Pelicans' lead back to double digits. ""It took a lot to just win this game,"" Redick said. ""Any time we got a lead, they just kept coming and I'm proud of our group for finishing them off."" Nickeil Alexander-Walker hit five 3s and finished with 19 points for New Orleans, while Melli was 5 of 7 from deep and scored 16. Melli even hit a 3 as he was fouled for a four-point possession, and New Orleans combined for 18 3s in all (on 46 attempts). ""Even with their guys injured, they still had shooting all over the floor,"" Kerr said. ""We didn't give up dunks. We didn't give up layups. They sprung free for open 3s all night long and we couldn't score at the other end."" TIP-INS Warriors: Chriss had 10 points. ... The Warriors shot 7 of 25 (28 percent) from 3-point range. ... Green was called for a technical foul, his fourth of the season, while waiting for the Pelicans' Hayes to shoot free throws. Pelicans: Coach Alvin Gentry went with his 10th different starting lineup of the season -- and seventh in the last seven games. Hayes, drafted eighth overall last summer, responded to his first start with a soaring block from behind on Robinson to thwart a fast break in the first quarter, drawing a raucous ovation from the crowd. ... E'Twaun Moore scored 10 points. TWO-NIGHT TEAR Alexander-Walker, drafted 17th overall last summer, has made 11 3-pointers in the span of two games, having made six in a career-high, 27-point effort in Miami on Saturday. ""The game's slowing down for Nickeil,"" Redick said. ""Secondly, to see the ball go in the basket is a big thing. It gives you confidence, obviously, and helps with your rhythm."" INJURED LIST Stephen Curry (broken left hand) and Klay Thompson (left knee) were just the beginning of the Warrior's injury list. Also out were guard D'Angelo Russell (right hand sprain), forward Kevon Looney (Neuropathy), guard Damion Lee (broken right hand), forward Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) and guard Jacob Evans III (strained groin).

"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James wasnt about to send Kobe Bryant home disappointed. With the former Lakers great sitting courtside, the teams current ranking superstar scored 12 of his 33 points during a breathtaking opening nine minutes for Los Angeles, which raced to a 25-point lead and handed the Atlanta Hawks their second ugly loss in 24 hours at Staples Center, 122-101 on Sunday night. I'm just trying to put on a show for him and give him a reason to be like, OK, we might come to another game, James said. The 34-year-old James said it was fantastic to play in front of Bryant, who helped the Lakers win five NBA titles during his 20-year career. I know he came to a game last year, James said. Just having him in the building, knowing what he did to this franchise, and for me and my teammates what it means to be a part of Laker Nation, the Laker family, it's a beautiful thing. I was one of the kids who had the chance to come out straight out of high school. He did it and I was just watching him. It's just so surreal for me, a kid from Akron to be able to have a guy like Kobe take time out of his day. Even at this point in my career it's still special. James joined the Lakers last season. I became part of the family and he welcomed me with open arms as well as everyone else. Just to have that support from one of the greatest Lakers to ever play is just special to me, James said. In a quarter full of highlights, James biggest play provided his first points. After JaVale McGee blocked Jabari Parkers shot, James grabbed the ball, passed to Danny Green and took the return pass for a slam dunk that brought the crowd to its feet two minutes in. James added two layups, a 3-point shot and a three-point play to help propel the Lakers to their 25-point lead with 3:17 still to play in the opening quarter. He also fed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope for consecutive baskets. James finished with 12 assists for his 11th double-double this season. Hes been at just an extraordinarily high level and dominating, coach Frank Vogel said of James. His effort on the defensive end has really spread throughout the group and the group has really bought into being dominant on the defensive end of the floor. We saw that in the first quarter with how we controlled the game from the start. Offensively, the shot making, his decision making, zero turnovers, 12 assists, I mean are you kidding me? The Hawks were routed 150-101 on Saturday night by the Clippers, who played without Kawhi Leonard. Kyle Kuzma scored 17 points in the Lakers 11th win in 12 games. Rajon Rondo had 15, Anthony Davis 14, Caldwell-Pope 13 and Green and Alex Caruso 11 apiece. Davis had five of the Lakers 14 blocked shots. Trae Young scored 31 for the Hawks, who lost four of five on a swing through the West. Cam Reddish had 13 while Allen Crabbe, Parker and DeAndre Hunter each scored 11. After falling behind by 25, the Hawks stopped the Lakers onslaught by going on a 13-0 run to close to 34-22. They got to 40-30 before the Lakers pulled away again. Green put an emphatic stamp on a 69-41 halftime lead when he swooped in to corral James missed shot for a slam dunk with 11 seconds before the buzzer. James then hit consecutive 3-pointers for the Lakers first points of the second half and added a nice fallaway jumper. Its tough when you cant make shots, Young said. Give a lot of credit to them. Theyre one of the best defensive teams in the league. Weve just got to be better knocking down shots, working on our game and trying to be more crafty around defenses like them. They were making a lot of blocked shots, making a lot of big plays. We had a lot of things that didnt go our way. Thats how our seasons been. Well get down big and we have to fight so hard to get back into the game that we take all the energy out of ourselves and hard to get ourselves back into the game. TIP-INS Hawks: Crabbe had a four-point play in the first quarter when he hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Troy Daniels. He made the free throw to cut the deficit to 34-20. ... The Hawks have lost three straight and six of seven. Lakers: With Avery Bradley out, Caldwell-Pope earned a second straight start and third of the season after scoring 16 points in 99-97 victory over Sacramento on Friday night. ... Dwight Howard energized the crowd when he blocked Parkers shot early in the second quarter. ... Bryant was shown on the big screen with 4:25 left in the first half and rose to acknowledge a standing ovation. UNIQUE DOUBLE Back at Staples Center less than 24 hours after absorbing a 49-point loss to the Clippers, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce asked if he preferred the games were split up. Yes, he said. Back-to-back on the road is tough no matter who the opponent is. Obviously you have two special teams with a lot of special talent with both of the L.A. teams. It makes it extremely difficult.","401160830"
"NEW YORK --  A week made a big difference for the New York Knicks. Julius Randle scored 30 points, Marcus Morris Sr. added 23 and the Knicks beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 123-105 Monday night to avenge a 21-point home loss eight days prior. R.J. Barrett added 15 points and Damyean Dotson had 11 for New York. In their first meeting November 10, the Cavaliers came into Madison Square Garden and posted a 108-87 victory. This time, they never led. ""We got off to a good start,"" Randle said. ""I think the start was everything. We started out 4 of 14 last week and never got going."" Kevin Porter Jr. led Cleveland with 18 points. Collin Sexton and Alfonzo McKinnie each had 14. Kevin Love, who had 17 points in the first meeting, did not play due to back tightness, the first game he's missed this season. ""He's a great player, a champion,"" Barrett said ""Having him out was, I wouldn't say great. But, we didn't have Mitch (Mitchell Robinson) last time so it's even now."" The Knicks scored the first four points and never trailed. Randle had 15 points in the first quarter as the Knicks built two 16-point leads before settling for a 32-20 advantage at the end of the quarter. The Cavaliers pulled within 36-31, but the Knicks followed with a 24-8 run and took a 60-39 lead on Randle's 3-pointer with 2:26 left in the half. Randle had 23 points at halftime as the Knicks took a 64-51 advantage into the break. Cleveland is also without Larry Nance Jr., who is out with a left thumb sprain. ""We were missing two really good players,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""We are not real deep as it is. We were missing one of our best, if not our best player, and our power sixth man. And with a team that is not deep, that is a really big difference."" The Cavaliers never got closer. The Knicks scored the first six points of the second half and increased their lead to 90-65 on Dotson's long jumper with 3:25 remaining in the third. The Knicks led 94-71 after three quarters and extended their lead to a game-high 27 points on Randle's bucket with 9:17 remaining. Cleveland only managed to get within 16 in the game's final minute. Jordan Clarkson (13), Brandon Knight (12) and Darius Garland (10) also reached double figures in points for Cleveland. ""All of these wins feel good,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Obviously, we didn't like the last time they came here."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: After shooting at least 80% from the foul line in six straight games, their longest streak since 2017, the Cavaliers shot a dismal 53.3% (16 of 30). ... Porter replaced Love in the starting lineup. Knicks: No Knick has reached double-digit assists in a game this season. Barrett's nine against the Bulls on November 12 is a season high for the team. ... New York did not commit a turnover in the first quarter while pressuring the Cavaliers into nine. ... The Knicks' 10 blocks tied a season high. They also recorded 10 against Orlando on October 30. WELCOME MAT Heading into Monday night, the Cavaliers had won their last 11 games against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, the longest winning streak ever recorded by a visiting team at MSG, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. They hadn't lost to the Knicks in New York since suffering a 117-86 blowout on January 30, 2014. MAKING A BEILEIN TO MSG Beilein is in his comfort zone at Madison Square Garden. His teams had won 10 straight games there, including his first game as the Cavaliers' coach on November 10. His Michigan teams won their last nine meetings at MSG, including the Big Ten Tournament Championship in 2018. Before Monday, the last time a Beilein-led team lost at MSG was on November 21, 2008, in the 2K Sports Classic against Duke (71-56).","401160831"
"NEW YORK --  The Pacers relied on the Holiday brothers to overcome some injuries in their backcourt. Aaron Holiday finished with career highs of 24 points and 13 assists, Justin Holiday scored 20 points and the Pacers cruised to a 115-86 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. ""It's a blessing he's on the team with us and we're two brothers in the NBA, let alone in the same team. It's crazy,"" Aaron Holiday said. Indiana was playing without Malcolm Brogdon and Jeremy Lamb, but the backcourt tandem of the Holiday brothers was effective, especially after coach Nate McMillan was successful on a replay challenge late in the third quarter. Aaron Holiday and Justin Holiday combined to hit three consecutive baskets to put the Pacers ahead 82-65 with 1:09 remaining in the period. ""They're playing great. They're playing with a lot of confidence,"" Domantas Sabonis said. ""Teams are doubling us, so we're just kicking it out to open shooters and they're knocking shots with confidence."" Sabonis had 16 points and a career-high 18 rebounds, while T.J. Warren added 19 for the Pacers, who were coming off consecutive losses to Houston and Milwaukee. Brooklyn was on a 7-0 run and within 75-62 with 3:10 left in the third quarter when Justin Holiday signaled to McMillan to challenge a call that the Pacers had lost the ball out of bounds. The call was overturned and the Pacers soon after pushed their lead back to 18. ""There is a style that we want to play and we want to make sure that we are connected out there and playing together,"" McMillan said. ""We talked about our three Ts and being together and showing some real toughness and trusting each other, regardless of who's in uniform. They've been able to do that and win some games."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 28 points and Jarrett Allen finished with 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, who played without Kyrie Irving for a second straight game and were held to their lowest point total of the season. Irving injured his shoulder while the Nets went 2/3 on their road trip. ""Below-average teams are inconsistent and that's what we are right now,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Nets didn't get a boost from being home, scoring a season-low 18 points in the first quarter and then following it up with just 17 in the second period to trail 59-35 at halftime. Indiana was sluggish early before tying it at 18-all. The Pacers then blitzed the Nets with a 11-0 run to start the second quarter, getting seven straight points from Warren while opening up a 29-18 advantage. Indiana later outscored Brooklyn by 30-15 and led by as many as 28 points with 28 seconds remaining in the half when Naz Mitrou-Long sealed a 13-0 spurt with an uncontested layup. Nets guard Joe Harris questioned the team's effort in the second quarter. ""There's a lot of it that's out of our your control when you're playing, but the things that are in your control are competing every possession, playing hard every possession, having that sense of energy,"" Harris said. ""The ownership, the pride, a lot of that stuff isn't there for us right now."" The Pacers improved to 2-0 this season against the Nets. Both of the wins have come at the Barclays Center. TIP-INS Pacers: Besides Brogdon (back) and Lamb (ankle), the Pacers were also without T.J. McConnell (groin). . Mitrou-Long had a career-high 12 points off the bench. Nets: Garrett Temple started in place of Irving and finished with 10 points and six rebounds. LETS JUST WAIT SOME MORE Atkinson said Irving is not at the point yet where he can go out on the court and play due to his shoulder injury. The team chose to be cautious with Irving as it is already without the services of G Caris LeVert, who underwent right thumb surgery last Thursday. ""That's the conclusion we came to for tonight's game,"" Atkinson said. ""Best that he didn't play."" Irving leads the Nets with 28.5 points and 7.2 assists per game.","401160832"
"TORONTO --  Raptors forward OG Anunoby put up an eye-catching line before catching an elbow to his right eye. After escaping serious injury for the second time in four games, Anunoby said he's considering playing with more protection moving forward. Anunoby scored a career-high 24 points before being jabbed in the eye, Pascal Siakam had 20 and Toronto beat Charlotte 132-96 Monday night, snapping a two-game losing streak against the Hornets. Norman Powell scored 17 points, rookie Terence Davis got all of his career-high 16 in the fourth quarter and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 15 as the Raptors posted their biggest margin of victory of the season and remained unbeaten in five home games. Anunoby made 6 of 7 attempts in the third, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Toronto coach Nick Nurse said Anunoby ""jump-started"" the Raptors by scoring 16 points in the quarter before getting poked in the right eye by Charlotte's Nicolas Batum while defending a drive to the basket. Anunoby sat out Wednesday's win at Portland after being struck in the eye by former teammate Kawhi Leonard during the first quarter of a road loss to the Clippers two days earlier. ""I wish they'd catch the guy who does it once in a while,"" Nurse said, upset that Anunoby did not get a foul call on either play. ""That's two games he's been hit in the head and nobody sees anything."" Anunoby returned to start Saturday's loss at Dallas, scoring eight points in 32 minutes. Anunoby went to the locker room for treatment after being poked by Batum, returning to the bench early in the fourth. The Raptors said Anunoby was available to play again, but he sat out the rest of the game as Toronto maintained a comfortable lead. As they watched the fourth together, Hollis-Jefferson suggested Anunoby try the mask made famous by a villain from the Batman movie series. ""We were joking about that on the bench towards the end of the game like `Hey dude, you're going to have to wear the Bane mask pretty soon just to keep people out of your eyes,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. Anunoby said he'll experiment with a different form of eye protection at Tuesday's practice and might wear something for Wednesday's game against Orlando. ""If it's what's best, I'll wear them, but we'll see,"" Anunoby said when asked about donning protective goggles. Last October 19, Anunoby wore goggles for one quarter of a game against Boston two days after leaving a win over Cleveland because of a right orbital contusion. Marvin Williams scored 14 points, Bismack Biyombo and MIles Bridges each had 13 and Devonte' Graham 11 as Charlotte allowed its highest point total of the season and lost for the fifth time in seven. Charlotte finished with 20 turnovers, one shy of its season-worst mark. The Hornets allowed 39 points off turnovers. ""We couldn't find any traction offensively and then we turned it over,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. Toronto outscored Charlotte 32-18 in the third, when the Raptors made seven of 12 attempts from 3-point range. Anunoby's 16 points in the third was two shy of Charlotte's team total. ""They came out and asserted themselves,"" Williams said of the Raptors. ""They imposed their will on us and we were never able to recover."" TIP-INS Hornets: Williams made all four of his field goal attempts in the second, including three from long range. ... The Hornets are 3-4 on the road. Raptors: F Stanley Johnson (left groin strain stress reaction) was inactive. Toronto recalled F Oshae Brissett from the G-League. . Anunoby's previous career-high was 22 points, set against Washington on Feb. 13, 2019. ... Chris Boucher scored 11 points and had a season-high 11 rebounds. ASSIST HISTORY The Raptors recorded a franchise record 40 assists. Gasol led Toronto with nine and VanVleet had eight.

The Chicago Bulls tried everything against the NBA MVP. Nothing worked. Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 10 rebounds, and the Bucks beat the Bulls 115-101 on Monday night for their fourth straight victory. ""I'm just going to keep trying to go downhill, keep trying to go through guys,"" said Antetokounmpo, brushing off the foul trouble. ""I'm really happy that they're offensive fouls and they're not dumb fouls and all that. ""Usually in the games like this that I get offensive fouls, I know that I'm aggressive. ... So I'm happy with that."" Brook Lopez added 19 points, 10 rebounds and five blocked shots as Milwaukee won for the eighth time in nine games. The Bucks also beat the Bulls 124-115 on Thursday in Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo was 13 for 22 in his 13th consecutive double-double to begin the season. It's the longest active streak in the NBA. ""They have a guy they can go to who can get the bucket,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""That's what good teams have. I've been on those teams. We're figuring out who that guy is."" Daniel Gafford led Chicago with 21 points in his return from the G League. Coby White had 13, and Ryan Arcidiacono finished with 12. The Bulls got a season-high 63 points from their reserves, but Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen struggled. LaVine finished with 11 points on 4-for-16 shooting, and Markkanen had nine on 2-for-12 shooting from the field. ""Shooters, all the players go through slumps,"" said Markkanen, who is shooting just 36.2% this season. ""Everybody's broken through it at some point.

George Hill finished with 18 points for Milwaukee, which improved to 7-2 on the road. Donte DiVincenzo scored 15 in his third consecutive start in place of Khris Middleton, who is out with a bruised left thigh.

Gafford went scoreless in his first four NBA games, but the second-round draft pick had 16 points in the first half on 8-for-9 shooting, including five dunks. Milwaukee closed the second quarter with a 12-2 run for a 60-56 halftime lead. Antetokounmpo had 18 points at the break. TIP-INS Bucks: Hill made four of Milwaukee's 15 3-pointers. ...

"HOUSTON --  James Harden has been scoring at such a prolific rate this season that his 36-point effort in Houstons rout of Portland on Monday night actually caused his average to dip. For him he had a subpar night, Portland coach Terry Stotts said with a slight laugh. Russell Westbrook added 28 points and a triple-double to help the Rockets to their eighth straight win, 132-108. Harden, who has scored at least 30 points in eight straight games, had six rebounds, five assists and a steal. He leads the NBA by averaging a career-high 39.2 points this season. The second-highest scorer in the league is Milwaukees Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is well behind Harden at 30.3 points a game. I think that a lot of people like to normalize greatness when you see it over and over again, Westbrook said. But it's not normal because there's no one else that can do it. If it was normal everybody would do it. He's put himself in a position to one of the best ... scorers of all time. Westbrook had 13 rebounds and 10 assists for his third triple-double of the season and the 141st of his career after sitting out to rest in Houston's last game on Saturday night. Coach Mike DAntoni loved the way Harden and Westbrook worked together on Monday night. You've got a dose of (Westbrooks) athleticism coming at you and they've got to get back and get a wall and then ... it didn't quite go and get it back to James and just let him do what James does, DAntoni said. It's a pretty good 1-2 punch, that's for sure. The Rockets led by double digits for most of this one on a night they got starters Clint Capela and Danuel House back after both players had missed time with injuries. Houston was up by 18 with about five minutes left when Harden made a 3-pointer to make it 120-99. Westbrook collected his 10th assist when Harden made a layup with about 3 1/2 minutes left for Houston's next points and the pair along with P.J. Tucker headed to the bench for good after that. CJ McCollum led the Trail Blazers with 25 points in a game where Damian Lillard shot just 4 of 15 and had 13 points. Stotts was unhappy that his team had more rebounds overall than Houston but had just 12 offensive rebounds to 17 by the Rockets. The thing that was probably the most disappointing was their offensive rebounding and how they converted their offensive rebounding into points, he said. I thought that was the difference in the first half. Houston led by 23 points entering the fourth quarter after scoring 35 points in a big third quarter. The Trail Blazers cut it to 102-85 with about 9 minutes to go but Westbrook had the next three points to pad the lead. The Trail Blazers cut the lead to 11 with a 3-pointer by McCollum with about 8 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. The Rockets then used a 19-6 run to make it 94-70 with about 2 1/2 minutes left in the period. Harden had six points in that stretch and Tucker made a 3-pointer and added five points. The Rockets were up by 14 at halftime after a 15-point second quarter from Harden. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Stotts said Carmelo Anthony is expected to join the team on Tuesday. Anthony hasn't played in the NBA since Nov. 8, 2018, when he was with the Rockets ... Portland made 11 of 36 3-pointers. Rockets: G Eric Gordon spoke to reporters on Monday for the first time since having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last week.

Hayes sat courtside with fellow Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon to witness Capelas big game. I talked to him a little bit after the game and he congratulated me, Capela said.

Doncic is the second-youngest player in NBA history to have a 40-point triple-double, after James. They are the only two players to record 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21. ""It feels like every day there are stats you don't know about, stats that you read about,"" Doncic said. ""It's great to hit."" Dallas led wire to wire but had to fend off a late Spurs rally, with Doncic hitting a 3-pointer with 26.5 seconds to play that put Dallas up 115-110 after the Spurs rallied from 14 down at the start of the quarter. Doncic has an NBA-leading six triple-doubles in 13 games this season. ""This guy can do anything he wants to on a basketball court,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He's having one of those magical runs right now. It's a phenomenal thing to watch. It's a phenomenal thing to be a part of."" Dallas got a career-high 22 points from Dorian Finney-Smith, and Kristaps Porzingis added 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Spurs have lost six in a row, their longest slide since 2011, and dropped eight of nine since a 4-1 start. They're off to their worst start since 1996-97, the season before they drafted former star and current assistant coach Tim Duncan. DeMar DeRozan scored a season-high 36 points for the Spurs, helping to lead a fourth-quarter surge after they trailed 93-79 entering the period. ""When adversity hits, you can't run from it, you can't shy away from it, you can't let it get you down,"" DeRozan said. ""Try to channel that energy and put it in the right place so we can understand why we got beat."" KEY SEQUENCE With Dallas up 110-107, both Bryn Forbes and Patty Mills missed potential game-tying 3s. On the ensuing possession, Porzingis lost the ball going up to shoot, but Finney-Smith scooped it up and fired an off-balance 20-footer as the shot clock expired. It fell through to put Dallas up five. ""I looked at the clock, and [the ball] just bounced right to me, and I threw it up,"" Finney-Smith said. ""Exactly like we drew it up."" After Rudy Gay's 3 brought the Spurs back within two, Doncic stepped back and hit the 3 that finally finished off San Antonio. FINNEY-SMITH EMERGES Finney-Smith shot 8-for-10 from the field and made three 3s. All the more impressive was that the fourth-year wing, who has built a reputation with his defense, had his career game while drawing a tough assignment in DeRozan. ""I think I owe [Carlisle] some money because I said I wouldn't go for [DeRozan's] pump fake, and he got me one time,"" Finney-Smith said. TIP-INS Spurs: Coach Gregg Popovich talked about Duncan, in his first season as an assistant coach: ""His mere presence is valuable. When a young kid has Tim Duncan put his arm around them and guide them in a certain way, give them a piece of advice, that's way more important than what I can do."" Mavericks: This was their first matchup with the Spurs since the retirement of Dirk Nowitzki, who played against San Antonio 78 times in the regular season -- more than he faced any other team. Nowitzki faced San Antonio 36 more times in the playoffs in six series between 2001 and 2014.","401160836"
"PHOENIX --  Bostons Kemba Walker took his time during the final seconds of the first half before accelerating around one defender and splitting two more while scooping a layup off the glass for the buzzer-beating basket. One night after their 10-game winning streak was snapped, the Celtics were right back to their dominating basketball. Jayson Tatum scored 26 points, Walker added 19 and Boston won for the 11th time in 12 games by beating the Phoenix Suns 99-85 on Monday night. We showed a lot of heart, a lot of fight, Tatum said. We could have held our heads down after yesterday. The streak ended and we lost a close game. But thats the good thing about the NBA, no matter how good or bad you play, theres another game coming up real soon. Thats what matters. Boston (11-2) had its lengthy win streak snapped Sunday by the Sacramento Kings but bounced back with a relatively easy road victory. The Celtics led by 15 at halftime thanks to a 20-4 run at the end of the second quarter and never had their lead cut to less than nine in the second half. You know youre not going to win every game but when you have opportunities to bounce back and learn from mistakes and then you actually come out and do it, it just feels good, Walker said. Tatum shot 8 of 16 from the field and added 11 rebounds. Marcus Smart scored 17 points but left early in the fourth quarter because of a sprained right ankle. Smart said he might have tried to return if the game had been close and that there wasnt much swelling after the injury. It just irritated the exact same ankle I was coming back from in the same spot, Smart said. But everythings fine. I should be fine to play the rest of the trip. Phoenix (7-5) was playing without starting point guard Ricky Rubio, who was out because of back spasms. The offense never looked comfortable without him, relying on individual plays instead of their usual crisp ball movement. Suns coach Monty Williams said Rubios absence hurt, but it didnt explain all the offensive issues. We havent had 20-point quarters all year, we had two tonight. Its a great learning experience for us, Williams said. We have an identity and one of those components is sharing the ball. When we move the ball and have player movement, were pretty good. Devin Booker led the Suns with 20 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 15. Phoenix shot just 40% from the field, including 28% from 3-point range, and had its lowest-scoring game of the season. Phoenix had a 38-37 lead midway through the second quarter but scored just four points over the final six minutes of the half. Credit to (Boston), theyre playing well, but Im not sure if it was them or if it was just us, Suns center Aron Baynes said. We just have to be better at sticking to what we do. We didnt look like ourselves tonight. WILLIAMS ADDS BIG MINUTES Boston reserve Grant Williams had a big impact on the game with two blocked shots during the teams 20-4 run to end the first half. He finished with four points and two rebounds in 18 minutes, one night after not playing against Sacramento. Grants two blocks were huge because we were dead on those plays and he covered for us, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston missed nine of its first 10 shots but rallied for a 26-22 lead after one quarter. ... Brad Wanamaker scored 10 points off the bench. ... Daniel Theis had no points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes. Suns: Rubios issues with back spasms were announced less than an hour before the game. Jevon Carter started in his place and finished with three points and two assists in 25 minutes. ... Booker came into the game averaging 31 points against Boston over seven career games, which was his highest against any opponent.","401160837"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Early in the second half, Karl-Anthony Towns went to the hoop and was rejected by Rudy Gobert. After that, Towns didn't even try to shoot inside the 3-point arc. Worked out pretty well. Towns tied a career high with seven 3s and scored 29 points to help the Minnesota Timberwolves hand the Utah Jazz their first home loss of the season, 112-102 on Monday night. Running repeated pick-and-pops near the top of the key and drawing Gobert, the two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, away from the basket paid dividends as the Timberwolves went on an 18-2 run in a stunning fourth quarter. ""I was feeling real good. I was feeling juiced,"" said Towns, who said his teammates were encouraging him to keep shooting. ""Don't worry about me,"" he said back to the bench. ""I'm going to keep throwing them up and they're going to go in."" Towns matched a franchise record with his 15 attempts from 3-point range. Without second-leading scorer Andrew Wiggins, the Timberwolves held the Jazz to season-low 36.8% shooting and were bolstered by Jeff Teague's 21 points and 11 assists. Rookie forward Kelan Martin had seven of his 14 points during Minnesota's decisive run in the fourth, and Robert Covington added 15 points. ""I was just being confident. I saw lanes and was shooting my floaters . and that opened my game up,"" Martin said. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 18 points before fouling out and Donovan Mitchell had 17 points on 5-of-24 shooting for Utah. The Jazz led 88-85 before the Timberwolves began a game-changing shooting streak. Towns hit three consecutive 3s in the fourth, the final jumper from 29 feet with 4:45 to play. He stood and admired the shot long after it went in as Utah called a timeout. ""It looked real nice,"" he said. ""Karl is a talent that can play inside and out and Rudy Gobert is an incredible defensive catalyst,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""So you want to do your best to keep him away from the basket as much as possible."" Teague hit two free throws in the midst of Towns' 3-point display and added a driving layup and two more foul shots a short time later. The point guard then found Martin for a 3 and the largest lead of the night for either team at 103-90. ""Teague was able to drive the ball. Their whole group was able to get where they wanted more than we would like,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""When Towns is spaced like that it puts even more pressure on your individual defenders."" Gobert had 16 points and 14 rebounds for the Jazz, who fell to 6-1 at home. The Jazz went cold when they usually heat up, in the fourth quarter of home games. ""We started to do it individually instead of moving the ball. I took some terrible shots,"" Mitchell said. Wiggins missed his third straight game -- the first two for personal reasons and this one due to illness. He was playing the best basketball of his career and had scored at least 25 points in six straight games. The Timberwolves lost their other two without the high-scoring wing. SUMMER WORK PAYS OFF Martin was playing in the G-League just last week but found himself on the floor and contributing down the stretch. Teague wasn't surprised and had been waiting for this moment. ""I worked with him all summer at my gym in Indiana. I know what he's capable of doing. He's a confident player and once he saw one go down, he can get hot and he can score in bunches, so I was happy for him,"" Teague said. Towns said the best encouragement for the rookie was giving him the ball in pressure situations and trusting him. ""He's a bona fide scorer and the most fundamental shooter on our team, and I know he can get hot. He's a microwave,"" Towns said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns got his fourth foul with 5:03 left in the third quarter by kicking Gobert during a 3-point attempt. ... Shabazz Napier was out with a sore hamstring. ... Minnesota has matched the 2015-16 season for the best road start in franchise history at 5-2. Jazz: Utah looked disjointed in Jeff Green's first extended run at center in Utah during the first half, and the Jazz were outscored by nine during the experiment. ... Dante Exum played his first game of the season after knee surgery in March and scored two points in 14 minutes. ... Emmanuel Mudiay drew a standing ovation with a fake behind-the-back-dribble drive that fooled his defender for a layup late in the third quarter.","401160838"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers offense wasnt doing much through three quarters, so they buckled down on defense and narrowly avoided getting beat by a couple of former teammates. Paul George hit a go-ahead 3-pointer against his old team with 25 seconds left, lifting Los Angeles over the Oklahoma City Thunder 90-88 on Monday night to improve to 8-1 at home. Its any other game but it was fun to see familiar faces and share some laughs, George said. With the Clippers minus Kawhi Leonard for the third straight game because of a bruised left knee, Oklahoma City tied the score at 86 on a 3 by ex-Clipper Danilo Gallinari. Chris Paul made two free throws after being fouled by George for an 88-86 lead, but Georges 3 put Los Angeles back ahead 89-88. Maurice Harkless was then called for a foul on Gallinari that was overturned following a replay challenge by Clippers coach Doc Rivers. Im changing my opinion. I think the challenge is good for the game, joked Rivers, who had been critical of the new rule. The Thunder retained possession and Terrance Ferguson inbounded to Gallinari, whose open 3-pointer missed. The last shot Gallo took, I cringed. Ive seen that movie before, said Lou Williams, who had 11 points and nine assists. Wide open at the top of the key, thats his shot. Luckily for us it rimmed out. George hit a free throw with 0.3 seconds left to close it out against the team that traded him to Los Angeles last summer. The difference in the game was me not fighting through that screen at the end that allowed Paul George to get that final shot, said Paul, who had forced a turnover by George on the previous play. The Thunder fell to 0-5 on the road. Montrezl Harrell had 28 points and 12 rebounds off the bench to lead the Clippers. George finished with 18 points after scoring 30-plus in his first two games of the season after rehabbing from two shoulder operations. Offense was spotty all night but we did a great job of making enough winning plays, Harrell said. That is just what it comes down to, putting enough stops together and making sure that the defense does not take a lapse even when your offense isnt going for you. Paul scored 22 points, making 10 of 11 free throws, in 29 minutes. Gallinari added 14 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, another former Clipper, had 11 points despite five fouls. Gilgeous-Alexander also took a late 3 that missed. Neither team led by more than six points all night. Harrell scored on back-to-back dunks, with Georges alley-oop pass setting up the first one, and he scored another basket before George followed with a 3-pointer to put the Clippers ahead 75-70. The Thunder led 79-78 on a basket by Dennis Schroder before Harrell dominated the final 2:44. Harrell scored eight straight points to give Los Angeles an 86-83 lead. The Thunder led 59-54 on Pauls 3-pointer in the third. The Clippers revived themselves with a 12-5 run, getting back-to-back 3-pointers from Patrick Patterson and JaMychal Green, to head into the fourth leading 66-64. George was limited to a single 3 in the quarter. TIP-INS Thunder: Gallinari and Gilgeous-Alexander were honored with a video tribute from the Clippers during a timeout in the first quarter. The people were very good to me and I was very happy to see the video, Gallinari said. Gilgeous-Alexander missed the video because he was talking to his coach. Ill have to go and see it later, he said. ... Hamidou Diallo (left knee sprain) sat out his second straight game. Clippers: Landry Shamet (high ankle sprain) missed his fourth game in a row. ... Assistant coach Sam Cassell turned 50. TURNING IT OVER George had seven turnovers as he continues to adjust to his new teammates. When you miss a lot of games youre usually sloppy with the ball, Rivers said. All of those things will get better for him as the season goes on. COMING HOME Paul hasnt left Los Angeles completely. His family continues to live here, including his wife and kids who have remained in local schools. His father and brother attended the game, too. I love coming back here, he said.","401160839"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  With Alec Burks leading the offense, the Golden State Warriors finally put together a team effort to end their seven-game slide. Burks scored a season-high 29 points, Glenn Robinson III added 20 and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-95 on Tuesday night. ""We've been competing, and I think this is probably one of the first games in a little while that we've put a full game together,"" said Marquese Chriss, later adding: ""I'm just happy we won to be honest. I could have not scored, and we had won, I'd have been all right. I think tonight was just fun for everybody."" Chriss and Eric Paschall each had 17 points for the Warriors. Draymond Green was just short of his 24th career triple-double with eight points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Rookie Ja Morant scored 20 points for Memphis, while Dillon Brooks finished with 18. Brandon Clarke added 17 and Jae Crowder had 15 points along with 11 rebounds as Memphis lost its second straight. Even undermanned, the Warriors were able to cause enough problems for Memphis that the game was pretty much over before halftime. The Warriors built their 61-46 halftime lead behind Memphis' poor shooting and poor defense. Much like its blowout loss to Denver on Sunday, Memphis' problems were evident in the second quarter when Golden State outscored the Grizzlies 26-4 to open the frame. ""We started putting stops together,"" Green said. ""Once we started putting stops together, we were able to get out and get some buckets in transition. Get the game in our pace. When you are putting three, four stops in a row together, you are able to open the lead up."" Memphis got the deficit to single digits late in the third quarter for the only time in the second half, but Golden State never let the Grizzlies threaten in the fourth. The second-quarter onslaught left Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins talking in the same terms as he did in Sunday's 131-114 loss to Denver: opponents hungry for a win, setting the tone early, then taking the game to another level, a level Memphis couldn't match. ""We started missing shots, and they were getting out and running on us,"" Jenkins said. ""But I felt like they played at a different level than us."" For the Warriors, that ""level"" represented the first win since Nov. 14 against Portland. ""Losing sucks,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said candidly. ""When you lose seven in a row, it's miserable. .Tonight, our players were rewarded, and now, hopefully, we can kind of use this as some momentum and get some more wins."" TIP-INS Warriors: With his second block of the game, Green passed Andris Biedrins (580) for fifth on the Warriors' career blocks list. . Robinson is the only Golden State player to start all 15 games this season. . Continued to have seven players listed as ""out"" because of injuries, including Stephen Curry (left hand fracture), D'Angelo Russell (right hand sprain) and Klay Thompson (left ACL rehab). Grizzlies: Reserve G Grayson Allen missed his ninth game with left ankle soreness. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins indicated Allen is close to returning, and the team may have a better feel by the end of the weekend. . Jaren Jackson Jr., who entered the game averaging 18.8 points in his last five games, was held to eight. . Clarke, who hit all eight of his shots Sunday against Denver, was 6 of 14 Tuesday night. . Made nine 3-pointers, ending a streak of seven straight games with at least 10 3-pointers. A WARRIOR SCARE With seven players sitting out, the Warriors bench took a collective gasp in the third quarter when Green went down under the Grizzlies basket holding his elbow. He came to the bench, but eventually returned in the fourth quarter. ""It's a little sore, but it's all right,"" Green said after the game. ""It just felt like a bruising pain, so I knew I would play through it."" Chriss was a little more worried at the time of the injury. ""I can't curse because I don't want to get in trouble, but I was mad,"" said Chriss. ""It seems like that's the type of things that are happening right now."" REHAB UPDATE The Warriors announced Tuesday that Kevon Looney, who has missed the last 13 games (Neuropathy) and Alen Smailagic, out since the preseason with a sprained right ankle, have been cleared to begin accelerated on-court basketball activities and will work out with G League Santa Cruz.","401160840"
"Carmelo Anthony says it was a great feeling getting back out on the court and describes the hectic hours leading up to his debut. (1:00) NEW ORLEANS --  Carmelo Anthony smiled easily in a hallway outside the Trail Blazers locker room and asserted that he felt great after the first game of his 17th NBA season, even if his new team couldnt keep pace with Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram and a largely revamped Pelicans squad that is showing signs of figuring some things out. It felt great just to be back into the flow of the game, be back on the court, be back to where I think I belong, Anthony said. As far as conditioning, though, I felt absolutely great out there. There was minor things, but it was more of the flow of things, and getting used to how the team plays and sets and getting used to the guys on the team. Holiday had 22 points and 10 assists, Ingram added 21 points in his return from a four-game absence, and New Orleans beat Portland 115-104 on Tuesday night for its second straight victory and third in four games. Anthony finished with 10 points while Portland leading scorer and four-time All-Star Damian Lillard missed his first game of the season with back spasms. Starting at forward and playing across the street from where he led Syracuse to the 2003 NCAA championship over Kansas, Anthony scored the Blazers first points of the game on a 3-pointer from 26 feet out. Anthony missed 10 of 14 shots, but also hadnt even participated in a full practice, having joined the team the day after its loss in Houston on Monday night. For having (only) a morning shootaround, I thought he was pretty good, Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. I thought every shot he had, he was getting a good look at the basket. Ingram looked spry in his return from right knee soreness, particularly on an authoritative, driving, one-handed dunk that got the crowd roaring in the opening quarter. I think trying to get to my spots and assert myself a little bit and getting other players involved, I think I did an OK job, Ingram said. I felt pretty good today. I didnt have any restrictions. C.J. McCollum led Portland with 22 points, while Hassan Whiteside added 14 points and 14 rebounds. J.J. Redick hit 4 of 9 3-pointers and scored 14 points for New Orleans. Kenrich Williams, starting at forward, filled the stat sheet with hustle plays, grabbing 14 rebounds to go with three steals, three drawn charging fouls and a blocked shot. He also scored eight points. He just makes winning plays, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Thats what he does -- winning play after winning play. New Orleans seized momentum in the third quarter, going up by 13 on a sequence that began when Nicolo Melli hit a 3 and then got the ball right back in a largely vacated Portland back court after Nickeil Alexander-Walker dove to swipe the ball away from McCollum. Melli went straight in for a dunk that made it 83-70. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Nassir Little had 12 points and 11 rebounds. ... Kent Bazemore scored 11 points. ... Shot 16 of 29 (55.2 percent) from 3-point range, but only 40 of 92 (43.5 percent) overall and missed five of 13 free throws. Pelicans: Melli finished with 14 points and ETwaun Moore added 11 points off the bench. ... Guard Frank Jackson returned after missing one game with a neck bruise and scored nine points. ... Guard Lonzo Ball (groin), center Derrick Favors (back) and guard Josh Hart (ankle) were among the injured for New Orleans. HOLIDAY HIGHLIGHTS Holiday highlighted his night with a spinning dribble around Little for a driving dunk. Im not really trying to dunk. That takes a lot of energy out of you, Holiday said, adding that it was really the way Little pursued him that spurred him to finish strong. I just felt him coming and at that point I wasnt trying to get my shot blocked. In the second half, Holiday scored on an unusual play in which he remained under his own basket, re-tying his shoes while his team advanced 4-on-5 into the offensive end. Holiday then came sprinting down court, took a handoff from Melli near the 3-point line and exploded toward the rim for a layup. ASSERTIVE ANTHONY Anthony wasted no time getting his first shot off. His miss from 20 feet came within the opening 30 seconds and was Portlands first shot of the game. Anthony also took Portlands second shot, hitting his first of two made 3s. But when Anthony tried to rise for a two-handed dunk in the first half, he was met with resistance by a member of the NBAs rookie class when eighth overall draft pick Jaxson Hayes rejected the attempt in what was his second of three blocks. I thought he was going to try to lay it up, Hayes said. It just shows his passion for the game still. Hes still trying to go dunk on people. ... Blocking it was pretty fun.","401160841"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  For the second time in two games against Phoenix this season, the Sacramento Kings allowed the Suns to have a 70-point second half. At least this time Luke Walton's team was able to overcome it. Barely. Bogdan Bogdanovic set career highs with 31 points and seven 3-pointers, and Sacramento beat the Suns 120-116 on Tuesday night. ""I know it didn't feel great the way we played in the second half but our guys stuck together and scrapped it out,"" Walton said. ""Even though it wasn't pretty ... we gutted out a win. We'll take that and hopefully learning a lesson while doing it."" The Kings were terrible against the Suns in Phoenix during a season-opening 124-95 loss on Oct. 23. Sacramento committed 27 turnovers and was outscored 70-36 in the second half of that game. This time, the Kings had 18 turnovers while Phoenix held a 71-58 scoring advantage after halftime. ""We have to finish it better and keep that lead until the end,"" Bogdanovic said. ""They changed their lineup and everyone started rolling and we kind of let them do whatever. We kind of were, `OK, we got it.' It's the NBA. You have to be ready to lock in and finish the game."" Richaun Holmes had 20 points and 15 rebounds, Nemanja Bjelica scored 17 points and Harrison Barnes added 15 for Sacramento. The Kings have won four of five.

""I loved the battle of our team and the way we came out at halftime,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""We changed up our defenses a little bit but they hit tough shots after tough shots. But I just loved the fight of our team. We stayed together."" Bogdanovic shot 11 of 14 overall and was 7 of 9 beyond the arc. He made four 3s and had 14 of Sacramento's 16 points during one stretch in the second quarter, then made three more from the perimeter in the fourth to help the Kings hold on. But Bogdanovic spent the final few moments of the game on the bench with tightness in his left hamstring. ""I think it's cramped,"" Bogdanovic said. ""I kind of felt it the whole second half but at the end it was a little bit harder and I had to go out. But it was OK."" Phoenix trailed by 26 early in the third quarter. The Suns were within 90-81 early in the fourth but couldn't stop Bogdanovic. The 27-year-old Serbian scored 11 points in the final 12 minutes, including his seventh 3-pointer that made it 106-91. Phoenix made a final push to get within 116-113 with 14 seconds left before Yogi Ferrell and Holmes made two free throws apiece for Sacramento. ""It felt like after playing so unselfish in the first half, 17 assists, ball flying around side to side, it felt like to me that we started trying to stat-hunt a little bit,"" Walton said. ""When we continued to run our plays we got wide open everything. When we got stagnant their zone stopped us."" The Suns were sluggish offensively early in their first road game since Nov. 2. Phoenix shot 26% in the first quarter and was marginally better in the second quarter. Ricky Rubio had one point and two assists in 16 minutes. Rubio did not play in Monday's loss to Boston because of back spasms. ""The cause of desperation and energy and sense of urgency is what we needed to start the third quarter with,"" Booker said. ""When you're down by 26 points it's a tough spot to be in.""

"LOS ANGELES --  To LeBron James, triple-doubles are not a goal. They are only a side effect of the consistent, brilliant all-around play he has been dishing out for 17 NBA seasons, with no slowdown in sight. Triple-doubles also don't mean much to LeBron without wins attached to them, so James was pleased when his latest statistical superlative occurred during yet another successful night for the surging Los Angeles Lakers. James became the first player in NBA history to record a triple-double against every team in the league, and Anthony Davis scored 34 points during the Lakers' fifth straight victory, 112-107 over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night. James finished with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to post a triple-double against his 30th opponent for the NBA-leading Lakers, who have won 12 of 13 after a perfect four-game homestand. James was more surprised than thrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different statistic glared at him from the box score. ""Coach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, 'Congratulations,' and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,"" James said. ""I really don't know what to think about it. I just think it's a pretty cool stat to know, and I'm glad it happened in a win."" James has five triple-doubles in the Lakers' last 10 games, getting four in victories. There's a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly filled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the NBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career average. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest streak of his career. Vogel has put the ball in James' hands constantly on offense, and his playmaking acumen has grown along with his chemistry with Davis, as they demonstrated repeatedly against the Thunder. Seven of LeBron's assists came on baskets by Davis. ""Amazing,"" Davis said. ""To be able to do that against every team is something special. I mean, (it's) trippy that he's been playing for a long time, so it was a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard work."" James is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him -- Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd -- hadn't done it against 30 teams. Kidd, who did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James' efforts as a tall point guard. ""He's just playing terrific basketball,"" Vogel said. ""For him to be doing what he's doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There's no reason to believe he can't sustain that for the rest of the season and help us make a real strong playoff push."" Dennis Schroder scored 20 of his season-high 31 points in a phenomenal first half for the Thunder, who have lost four of five despite two solid performances at Staples Center. Danilo Gallinari added 25 points in his former home arena, and Nerlens Noel had 15. ""That's why (James) is considered probably the best of all time, but I think we did a great job on him,"" Schroder said. ""They obviously hit some tough shots."" One night after the Thunder barely missed an upset win over the Clippers thanks to a last-minute 3-pointer by former star Paul George, Oklahoma City couldn't quite catch up to the powerful Lakers despite keeping the game close all night. ""There's a lot of things we did well in there,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""But, you know, we came up short in all these games. I think the one sign you can point to is both teams, the Clippers and the Lakers, are really, really good teams, so we're competing well at a high level. But we've just got to do more in order to be able to finish and close out games."" The Thunder won't have to wait long for a rematch: These teams meet again in Oklahoma City in three days. TIP-INS Thunder: F Hamidou Diallo missed his third straight game with a left knee sprain. ... Schroder got a technical foul in the third quarter for confronting Davis at the free throw line after Davis dunked and was fouled. Lakers: Kyle Kuzma left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion after teenager Darius Bazley hit him in the right side of his face with an elbow on a drive. Kuzma returned to the bench in the second half, but with obvious damage above his eye. He didn't return to the game, although Vogel said he was available if necessary. The Lakers plan to re-evaluate him within the next 24 hours. CLOSEOUT SEQUENCE James' 3-pointer put the Lakers up 109-98 with 3:08 to play, but the Thunder scored nine straight points to cut the Lakers' lead to two on Gallinari's free throws with 1:24 left. After Danny Green got a key offensive rebound for the Lakers, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drilled a 3-pointer with 55 seconds left. James missed two free throws moments later to keep the Thunder in it, but Oklahoma City couldn't score again. POINT GUARDS BEHAVE Chris Paul had four points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Thunder, and he didn't appear to clash with Rajon Rondo, his opponent in a fight early last season while he was with the Rockets. Rondo had eight points and a season-high 10 assists.","401160843"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Ben Simmons wore a ""Sesame Street"" sweatshirt in the locker room, the classic characters lined up on the familiar street. The theme seemed appropriate for 76ers fans, because it was finally time to count Simmons' 3-pointers. One! One 3-pointer for Ben Simmons! ""Hold me back, fam!"" 76ers announcer Marc Zumoff exclaimed on the TV call. The anticipated shot didn't win a playoff or even big regular-season game. Simmons, though, got the weight of the ridicule for the career 0-fer off his back when he hit the first 3-pointer of his career and had 18 points and 13 assists to lead Philadelphia to a 109-104 victory over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. Mike Scott's fourth 3-pointer of the game with 1:29 left stretched the Sixers' lead to 99-95 and they held on after New York's Marcus Morris hit a pair of 3s in the final 10 seconds. Joel Embiid had 23 points and 13 rebounds, and Scott scored 12 points. The only shot that mattered in Philly was the 3 from Simmons, finally, in his 172nd career game and after nearly $19 million in salary. Simmons acted like it was no big deal. ""It feels good, yeah. You put in work in the summer and it pays off,"" Simmons said. Simmons did the improbable when he fired a 24-footer from the corner in front of the 76ers bench and the shot was good, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Simmons received a lengthy standing ovation for the first 3-pointer after 17 misses (and one more miss in the postseason) to start his NBA career. The 23-year-old Simmons is an All-Star and franchise cornerstone for the Eastern Conference contenders, a triple-double threat each time out. But never a long ball threat, a fact that earned him derision around the league. He's been criticized for his lack of outside shooting, defiant at times about his weakness and spent the offseason working hard on improving his jumper. Simmons said at the start of training camp, if he's open for a 3-point shot, ""I'll take it."" ""Other people get more excited than I do,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""But how can it not be a good thing? But if we're all honest, that's the first legitimate 3 that he's taken."" Simmons sank a 3 against the Guangzhou Loong-Lions of China in the preseason that had Sixers fans treating the shot like he hit a winner in an NBA postseason game. Against the Knicks, Simmons took a bounce pass from Furkan Korkmaz and calmly drained the shot with 8:20 left in the first quarter. ""There's Simmons. Yes! He did it,"" Zumoff said. ""Maybe now they'll finally leave him alone after that! He hits the 3! The first of his NBA career!"" He did it in front of everyone from fans that paid $8 on the secondary market for an upper deck ticket to Hall of Famer Julius Erving. Simmons' older sister and , Liv, clapped back at critics, tweeting, ""Now you can all shut the hell up...."" Maybe Dr. J can deliver that basketball straight to Springfield, Massachusetts. Simmons hit one 3; the four-win Knicks hit 11, and used a fantastic third quarter to take a 17-point lead. Morris led the Knicks with 22 points. Simmons even played peacemaker in a scrap between his teammate Embiid and Morris, a Jayhawk-on-Jayhawk altercation that had Kansas fans everywhere waving the white flag instead of the wheat. Morris dragged Embiid to the court late in the second quarter, and the Sixers All-Star center popped up in anger. Simmons pulled away his teammate to avoid a repeat of Embiid's brawl last month with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns that earned him a two-game suspension. Embiid and Morris jawed at each other and each was hit with a technical foul. Morris also earned a flagrant. ""I just got thrown on the ground and I really don't know why I got a technical foul,"" Embiid said. ""I'm being the victim and didn't do anything. I feel like it's starting to get ridiculous with the flagrants."" It's not the first confrontation between the two: Morris played for Boston when he was trash-talked by the theatrical Embiid. Morris held up three fingers to show Boston was up 3-0 in a 2018 playoff series. ""He started it last year in the playoffs and he keeps going,"" Embiid said. They went back-and-forth in the fourth in Philly. Embiid thundered a two-handed jam off a turnover to tie the game at 82-all and put some life back in the Sixers only for Morris to hit a jumper for an 85-83 lead. ""He be flopping. He was flopping and grabbing,"" Morris said. ""I'm not the one that's gonna take that. He knows that."" HE SAID IT ""Big dog, I'm 240,"" Morris, on if he was surprised how easily Embiid crashed to the ground. BOOMER, BABY Simmons, a native Australian, said he was excited Brown seems set to return to coach the Australian national team in the Olympics. ""I'm looking forward to it. He's coaching me now, so we have a great relationship,"" Simmons said. TIP-INS Knicks: Lost to the 76ers for the ninth straight time. ... Julius Randle and Frank Ntilikina each scored 17 points. ... Morris led with four 3s. 76ers: G Josh Richardson sat out with hip injury and was replaced in the starting lineup by Korkmaz. ... Hit 13 3s.","401160844"
"WASHINGTON --  Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, their longest skid since he took over as the teams coach more than 20 years ago. With little resistance at the defensive end from San Antonio on Wednesday night, Washingtons Bradley Beal shot 9 for 9 in a 21-point third quarter en route to scoring 33 in all, and the lowly Wizards beat the Spurs 138-132. All in all, if you score 132 points, you should probably have a pretty good chance to win a game. The bad news is, if you give up 138, you are not going to win, Popovich said during a brief-as-can-be postgame session. Im a really smart guy. Im figuring thats logical. I could be wrong. ... Theres not much else to say. It is the Spurs worst stretch since they had a pair of droughts that lasted seven and eight games in 1996-97, when David Robinson got injured and Popovich moved from the front office to the sideline about a quarter of the way through the season. In the ensuing draft, the Spurs took Tim Duncan, who starred for the team and now is an assistant to Popovich. San Antonio has made the playoffs in each of the past 22 seasons, claiming five NBA championships in that time. Put simply, the Spurs are not used to this sort of lose night-after-night thing. The streak that were on, every single game weve lost feels worse than the last game, said DeMar DeRozan, who led San Antonio with 31 points but missed a pair of free throws with 9.9 seconds left and Washington up 136-132. The Spurs fell to 5-10, despite being ahead 69-63 at halftime and having eight players score in double figures. That included Patty Mills, who made his first start of the season and began the night 6 for 6 from the field but missed his next four shots and finished with 16 points. Weve just got to stay positive. Weve got to stick together, Mills said. Weve got to find a way and well get through it. Davis Bertans, acquired by Washington from San Antonio in the offseason, and Ish Smith each scored 21 for the Wizards, who came into the day with a 3-8 record, the worst mark in the Eastern Conference. San Antonio led by 10 before Beal scored nine points in a 22-3 spurt over about 5 minutes in the third quarter that put the Wizards out front 94-85. It was quite a turnaround for Beal, who went just 3 for 9 in the first half. Brad took over, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said, and hes hard to stop. TIP-INS Spurs: Bryn Forbes scored 19. ... Derrick White missed a game for the first time this season; he had a sore left foot. Wizards: This was the 10th consecutive time -- and 11th in 12 games this season -- that the Wizards gave up at least 60 points in the first half. POP ON FEMALE COACHES Before a game between two teams that have a female assistant (San Antonios Becky Hammon and Washingtons Kristi Tolliver), Popovich was asked about the possibility of a female head coach in the NBA. His answer: Theres no difference between a woman who knows the game and a man who knows the game. It's just another prejudice that probably has to be overcome -- just like a lot of other prejudices in the world have become less and less as people pay attention to them. Its a process. It doesnt happen quickly. But I think the more women there are, obviously, it becomes more commonplace and the rule, and it will depend on an organization realizing that there are women that can do this. Every woman can't; every man can't. The point is that theres got to be enough to choose from.","401160845"
"ATLANTA --  Giannis Antetokounmpo wasnt concerned that the Milwaukee Bucks let the Atlanta Hawks back in the game late in the fourth quarter. What mattered to Antetokounmpo was another road win for his streaking team. If you want to be a really good team in this league, youve got to win on the road, he said. It doesnt matter where we play, as long as we come out there and give ourselves a chance to win every night. Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 11 rebounds, Eric Bledsoe scored 28 and the Bucks won their fifth consecutive game with a 135-127 victory over the Hawks on Wednesday night. It marked the league-high ninth time this season that Antetokounmpo, the reigning NBA MVP, has had at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. The Bucks, with the leagues second-ranked offense, have won nine of 10 and improved to an NBA-best 8-2 on the road despite a sloppy ending as Atlanta cut the lead to single digits in the final minute. Rookie forward DeAndre Hunter finished with a career-high 27 points and Trae Young scored 25 for the Hawks, who have lost four straight and seven of eight. Atlanta was coming off a 1-4 road trip that included a 49-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. When we play at other teams paces, its tough for us, Young said. Weve got to be better at dictating the speed of the game instead of letting them dictate it. This game was close in the first half, but Milwaukee led by 18 on Pat Connaughtons 3-pointer with 9:53 remaining. The Hawks whittled a 19-point deficit to seven late in the fourth quarter, causing Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer to put Antetokounmpo back in the game before Sterling Brown hit a corner 3 to make it 129-119 with 1:48 left. They threw a different type of defense out, press and play hard, Bledsoe said. But I thought we did a great job of sustaining. Antetokounmpo took a fast-break pass down the right side for a big dunk on the baseline to make it 42-35 in the second quarter and scored on consecutive possessions to put the Bucks up 73-63 in the third, finishing off a 15-2 run with a fast-break dunk. After the Hawks trimmed the lead to five a few minutes later, Antetokounmpo hit a 3 to cap a 17-point performance in the third. Connaughtons short runner built the lead to 96-83 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Bucks: G Donte DiVincenzo, making his fourth straight start, had 11 points. Its been a good run for DiVincenzo, who scored 15 points against Chicago and 14 against Indiana as a starting replacement for Khris Middleton (bruised left thigh). Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce said G Kevin Huerter has better range of motion in his shoulder but is still expected to miss at least another week with a left rotator cuff strain. SPECIAL OUTFITS The Hawks went with a new look to celebrate their 50th season in the Peach State, decking out the floor with a black team logo trimmed in peach and a peach logo on the baselines. The team wore black uniforms that read Peachtree in white and peach trim across the jerseys. State Farm Arena is about five blocks west of the citys renowned Peachtree Street. LOPEZ IN THE PAINT Bucks center Brook Lopez finished with two blocks. He had five blocks in his past two games and ranks third in the league, but Budenholzer thinks Lopez doesnt get enough credit. Its amazing when hes able to contest a shot, make them miss and get the rebound, Budenholzer said. Its sometimes underrated what he does.","401160846"
"NEW YORK --  Without Kyrie Irving for the third straight game due to an injured right shoulder, the Brooklyn Nets used a trio of players to pick up the slack. Jarrett Allen led the way with 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds, and the Nets beat the Charlotte Hornets 101-91 on Wednesday night. ""I just thought (Allen) was huge,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They went small, they put Marvin (Williams) at the 5. We said we'll stick with JA, and I thought he did two great things. He guarded when we switched, he guarded their smalls, and then he punished them on the other end with his offensive rebounding."" Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie added 20 points apiece for Brooklyn. It marked the first time the Nets had three players score 20 or more points in a game. Terry Rozier had 18 points and Devonte' Graham added 17 for Charlotte, which lost its second straight game. Charlotte held the Nets to two points through the first five minutes of the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to 84-81. ""We're struggling to score the ball,"" Atkinson said. ""We're going to have to go to the drawing board and find some solutions there. It's tough to defend when you're not putting it in the hole. We have to get back to getting to the free throw line. I feel like we've slipped there. We're hanging out hat on our defense right now."" Prince agreed. ""I think our offense was sparked by the defense tonight,"" Prince said. ""I think we kept the lead when we needed to and it raised our level of intensity on the defensive end when we needed it to as well."" The Nets regrouped from their offensive slump to start the quarter by holding the Hornets to five points over the next five minutes. Prince's driving layup gave the Nets a 95-86 lead with 3:28 remaining during that span and they never looked back. ""I think they did a good job with their switching. I think their switching really slowed us down a little bit,"" Charlotte's Marvin Williams said. ""We got a little stagnant out there. We just have to continue to move the ball and move bodies to combat some of that switching. So, give those guys a lot of credit. They played well tonight."" Brooklyn held the Hornets to 73 points, the fewest the Nets have allowed through three quarters this season, to take a nine-point lead into the fourth quarter. Allen led the Nets with 11 points in the third. The Nets took a 56-51 lead into the locker room at the half as Prince and DeAndre Jordan led all scorers with 12 points apiece Both teams scored 26 apiece in the first quarter as Prince led the Nets with nine points and Bismack Biyombo scored eight for Charlotte. TIP-INS Hornets: Coach James Borrego credited Graham's strong start to studying Kemba Walker and Tony Parker last season. ... Charlotte shot 37%. Nets: Atkinson on Irving's injury status: ""I don't think it's a long-term thing. I wouldn't say we're being overcautious. . Do I think it's a long-term thing? No. I don't think he can play through it right now quite honestly. That's where we are. We'll see where that goes."" . Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) is also out for Brooklyn. CENTERS OF ATTENTION Allen's 22 points equaled the highest total he and Jordan had combined for in a game this season. They totaled 36 on Wednesday, with Jordan making all five shots in his 14-point outing.","401160847"
"MIAMI --  John Beilein had seen Duncan Robinson get on hot shooting stretches plenty of times before. None of those were at his expense. Robinson put on a show for his college coach -- and got himself into the Miami record book as well. He set team marks with seven 3-pointers in the second quarter, eight in the first half and finished with a career-high 29 points as the Heat rolled past Beilein and the Cleveland Cavaliers 124-100 on Wednesday night. ""That young man the last two years has developed with the Miami culture,"" said Beilein, the first-year Cavaliers coach who had Robinson for three seasons at Michigan. ""He's developed his game into a whole different level. ... Part of it you hate, but it's also part of your blood."" Robinson was 9 for 15 from the field, all of them coming from 3-point range. His early flurry helped Miami tie a franchise mark with 75 first-half points. The lead was 27 at the break and the Heat stayed in control the rest of the way. Kevin Love's jumper with 9:07 left got Cleveland to 102-86 and capped a 13-3 run, but the Cavs didn't get any closer. ""It's not lost on me that Coach B has done so much for my career,"" Robinson said. ""So it's pretty cool to have us competing on a stage like this. We're very competitive people so it's nice to come out on top, but I'm also very appreciative of everything he's done for me."" Tyler Herro scored 22 points for Miami, which had no problem on a night when Jimmy Butler missed 12 of his first 13 shots and finished with 21 points anyway. ""We can't keep surprising people,"" Butler said. ""We're for real. I don't think anybody wants to play against us and that's the way we want to keep it."" Love scored 25 and grabbed 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 19 points. The Heat record for 3-pointers in a game is 10, a mark held by Mario Chalmers and Brian Shaw. Robinson had three shots in the final moments to get his 10th -- missing them all. He connected on one with about 15 seconds left, but it was waved off by a shot clock violation. It was Cleveland's 17th consecutive loss in Miami, a stretch that started during the 2010-11 season -- LeBron James' first with the Heat after leaving the Cavaliers for the first time. The Heat record for 3-pointers in a half had been six, held by many and done most recently by Wayne Ellington in the second half against Toronto on April 11, 2018. The record for 3s in a quarter also was six -- Ellington did that twice (the Toronto game in 2018, and against Atlanta in 2017), and Shaw did it first against Milwaukee in 1993. Those marks belong to Robinson now. He had 24 points by halftime, all on 3-pointers. That was better than his previous career best of 23, set at home earlier this season against Houston. ""You couldn't be more happy for a guy like Duncan because he puts in so much time,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Robinson's high in three seasons under Beilein at Michigan was 21. His only 30-point effort in college came in 2014 -- for Williams against Amherst in the 2014 NCAA Division III semifinals, before he was given a scholarship by Michigan. His G League high last season was 36 for Sioux Falls. ""I'm really proud of him,"" Beilein said. ""All of Michigan is proud of him."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's 17-game losing streak at Miami has included 74 players and six coaches. The Cavs' last win in Miami was Jan. 25, 2010. ... Cleveland starters Cedi Osman, Darius Garland and Sexton were a combined 2 for 17 for seven points in 43 first-half minutes. They didn't start the second half. Heat: Miami improved to 10-3, tying the best 13-game start in team history. The 1995-96, 1999-2000, 2012-13 and 2013-14 Heat also were 10-3. ... Bam Adebayo was 4 for 4 in the opening three minutes and finished 5 for 5. ... Spoelstra improved to 533-366 in 899 games as Heat coach. His milestone 900th is Friday in Chicago. HEAT AT HOME The Heat are 6-0 at home, the first time that's happened since 2012-13. The biggest deficit they've faced at home this season is eight points -- every other team in the league has trailed by more at home at least once. THOMPSON RESTS The Cavaliers gave Tristan Thompson the night off to rest, mindful that they have a back-to-back later this week. It was the first game Thompson has missed this season -- but the third straight Cavaliers at Heat game in which he hasn't played.","401160848"
"TORONTO --  The Orlando Magic hit Toronto on a three-game winning streak. They limped out of town with two key starters hobbled by injuries. Fred VanVleet scored 24 points, Pascal Siakam had 18 points and 11 rebounds and the defending champion Raptors beat the Magic 113-97 on Wednesday night. Orlando lost center Nikola Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon to right ankle injuries in the second quarter. Vucevic used two crutches to leave the locker room afterward, while Gordon had one. It hurts not being able to play, not being able to help my team win, Gordon said. Gordon checked out with 8:27 left in the first half, seconds after ending up on the floor while trying to block Anunoby. It was basically a full jump, Gordon said. I came down and landed on the back of someones leg and rolled over. Thats why I knew it was hurt a little bit more, because I had jumped all the way up. Vucevic came in as the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week after after averaging 21.7 points, 14.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.33 blocks during Orlandos winning streak. He went down along his own baseline with 5:29 left in the second after injuring his ankle while trying to defend Norman Powells drive to the basket. It was really painful, Vucevic said. It was hard for me to put any pressure on. Well see. Im supposed to get an MRI (Thursday) and then Ill know more after that. Its pretty painful right now. Vucevic had to be helped to the locker room, unable to put weight on his right leg. He said X-rays came back negative. Orlando has second-year centre Mo Bamba and third-year big man Khem Birch ready to fill in, but coach Steve Clifford said theres no doubt his team will miss Vucevic. When you lose your best player, its hard to say you have more than enough, Clifford said. Still, Clifford refused to hang his head about Orlando's injury situation. You get up in the morning, you say Who do we have, and then you figure out the best way to have a good day with that group, he said. Thats all you can do in this league. Raptors rookie Terence Davis scored a career-high 19 points, Chris Boucher had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Norman Powell scored 15 points. Toronto improved to 6-0 at home and won for the eighth time in 10 meetings with the Magic. Forward Jonathan Isaac started for Orlando after missing the previous two games because of a sprained right ankle. Isaac played 33 minutes, scored 16 points and matched his career high with 13 rebounds. It was good to have him out there, Clifford said Obviously he adds so much to our team. I thought he played well, did a good job. Evan Fournier scored 21 points, Terrence Ross had 14 and Markelle Fultz added 12 for the Magic. Orlando is 0-5 on the road. VanVleet scored 20 or more for the fifth time this season. He had five 20-point efforts in 64 games last season. Its definitely impressive what hes been able to do, Siakam said about VanVleet. Hes just playing at a very high level right now. TIP-INS Magic: G Michael Carter-Williams said an MRI showed no structural damage to his injured left hip. Carter-Williams left in the second quarter of Sundays home win over Washington. There is no timetable for his return. ... Orlando scored 32 points in the first quarter but just 36 in the second and third combined. ... Birch scored a season-high 12 points. His career-high is 13.

Anunoby wore protective glasses to begin the game, but removed them midway through the first. He did not attempt a shot while wearing the glasses. NOT SO FAST For the first time this season, Toronto was outscored on fast break points. Orlando scored 16 fast break points while the Raptors had five, the first time this season theyve scored fewer than 11.

"Steve Kerr comments that he wants his team to completely forget about the historic 48-point loss they suffered to the Mavericks and look forward to their next challenge. (0:49) DALLAS --  The front of their jerseys said San Francisco and the names on the back werent the same Golden State Warriors that reached the past five NBA Finals. The Dallas Mavericks took full advantage. Luka Doncic scored 33 of his 35 points in the first half and had yet another triple-double to help Dallas hammer short-handed Warriors 142-94 on Wednesday night. Doncic fell a point short of matching Dirk Nowitzki's team record for points in a half, set Nov. 3, 2009, against Utah. Doncic was 10 for 11 from the floor, making 6 of 7 3-pointers, and hit 7 of 8 free throws. The second-year star from Slovenia was coming off a 40-point triple-double Monday. With his team up big on this night, Doncic played only 25 minutes total, but still managed 10 rebounds and 11 assists. He has an NBA-best seven triple-doubles in 14 games. If he had kept playing today, he probably would have had 50 (points), teammate Tim Hardaway Jr. said. Hes doing a great job playing with the utmost confidence. Doncic had 22 points, five assists and five rebounds in the first quarter alone. I see (the stats), but I dont know what to say, Doncic said. Its great to read about. I just enjoy the basketball. The Mavericks tied a franchise record with 22 3-pointers while sending Golden State to its worst loss since a 1973 playoff game. Flush it down the toilet, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said when asked what his team can take away from the game. Literally, you just move on. You dont take anything from a game like this. Rookie Eric Paschall led the Warriors with 22 points. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 20 for Dallas. Kristaps Porzingis had 14 points and 10 rebounds for his fourth-straight double-double. WOUNDED WARRIORS The Warriors are an NBA-worst 3-13. Their five-year run of at the top of the NBA has collapsed under a weight of injuries, with Draymond Green out Wednesday because of right heel soreness. With Green out, Golden State dressed only eight players, none of whom suited up for the team last season when it made the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive year. Kerr could at least find humor in the Warriors result. Tough to lose by 48 points, but a break here or there and it only would have been 42 points, Kerr said, then paused and added, Nobody caught the sarcasm? I was trying to be funny. SUPERNOVAS Paschall, Warriors teammate Omari Spellman and the Mavs Jalen Brunson all started for Villanova during their run to the 2018 national championship. All finished in double figures on Wednesday, with Brunson scoring 15 on a perfect 6-for-6 shooting night. Spellman had 11 for Golden State. Its always great playing against all my Villanova guys, said Paschall, holding Brunsons Dallas jersey that his former teammate had given him after the game. It proves what Coach (Jay) Wright has done. HARDAWAY MAKES IT LOOK EASY Hardaway got the start in place of Seth Curry, who was ill, and he took advantage of the assignment, tying his season high with 20 points. I just wanted to see a couple go in, Hardaway said. I wanted to go in there and make a presence for myself and for the team. TIP-INS Warriors: One of the few things that went the Warriors' way was when coach Steve Kerr challenged a defensive foul call on Willie Cauley-Stein with 1:56 left in the first half, and the call was reversed into an offensive foul on Dallas' Dwight Powell. Mavericks: Dallas previously made 22 3s in a game twice, the last time in February against Milwaukee.","401160850"
"CHICAGO --  After struggling with his shot for weeks, Lauri Markkanen said busting out of a slump Wednesday night was as simple as seeing the ball go through the basket. ""The shot's been feeling good the whole time,"" he said. ""That's why it was frustrating to see it come out. It feels good to see a couple go in."" Markkanen scored 24 points on 7-for-14 shooting, Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 points and 15 rebounds, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 109-89. It was Markkanen's first 20-point game since scoring 35 points on opening night. Tomas Satoransky and Shaquille Harrison each had 15 points as the Bulls snapped a three-game losing streak. ""I thought he was aggressive, I thought he ran the floor, I thought he got two real good ones at the rim early where he ran the floor,"" Chicago coach Jim Boylen said of Markkanen. ""I thought his effort was really good, and I thought he locked in defensively."" Derrick Rose had 18 points and Blake Griffin -- in just his third game of the season -- added 16 as the Pistons dropped their fifth straight. ""Defensively, it was a lack of effort tonight,"" Pistons forward Langston Galloway said. ""It was embarrassing, it really is embarrassing. We have to fight our way out of this. We're in a deep hole right now. We really have to step it up."" The Bulls won the first meeting between the teams 112-106 on Nov. 1, also at the United Center. Detroit's Andre Drummond finished with six points and 14 rebounds before fouling out with six minutes to go. Drummond had 25 points and 24 rebounds against the Bulls three weeks ago. Markkanen, who entered the game shooting just 36.2% from the field, had 15 first-half points on 5-for-8 shooting (including 2 for 2 on 3-pointers) as Chicago took a 59-55 halftime lead. That included an incredible six points on one possession late in the second quarter. Markkanen hit a 3-pointer while being fouled by Drummond, who was assessed a flagrant foul after review. Markkanen hit the free throw to complete the four-point play and then scored on a driving layup after the Bulls inbounded the ball. That stretch snapped a tie at 51 and gave the Bulls a 57-51 lead with 1:55 left. Chicago took an 84-71 lead after three quarters and then stretched it to 89-71 on five quick points by Thaddeus Young. The Bulls coasted from there. Markkanen hit a 3 with about 5 1/2 minutes to play for a 99-77 lead, Chicago's biggest of the game. TIP-INS Pistons: G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction) missed his 12th straight game. F Tony Snell (left hip strain) and G Khyri Thomas (right foot stress reaction) also sat out. Bulls: F Otto Porter (left foot) will be sidelined an additional two-plus weeks after a follow-up MRI taken on Tuesday revealed a bone bruise that wasn't discovered in the initial MRI two weeks ago. Porter will be re-evaluated in two weeks . F Chandler Hutchison, who had been starting in Porter's absence, sat out with inflammation in both shins ... G Coby White played despite spraining an ankle in pregame warmups and scored 12 points. DENG HONORED Luol Deng, who signed a one-day contract with the Bulls last month before retiring, was honored during the game. The 6-foot-9 forward played the first 10 of his 15 NBA seasons with the Bulls after being selected with the seventh pick of the 2004 draft. ""It's what makes sense,"" Deng said. ""Chicago means a lot to me. When you look back, coming here as a young kid, a young man, 19 ... there's a lot of history here and I wanted it to end the right way."" A video tribute was played during a timeout in the second quarter and several of Deng's former Bulls teammates -- including Joakim Noah and Ben Gordon -- attended the game. Deng said he picked this game because he wanted Rose to be present as well. STEPPING UP Harrison had played a total of 12 minutes before Wednesday, but was inserted into the starting lineup with Porter and Hutchison sidelined. Besides the 15 points (on 7-for-12 shooting), Harrison had 11 rebounds and five assists in 26 minutes. ""He stayed ready,"" Boylen said. ""It's really a credit to him. He's a winning dude.""","401160851"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  For the second time in three nights, the Utah Jazz watched the Minnesota Timberwolves fire away from 3-point range. The result was different this time. With the Wolves misfiring on 31 of their 45 attempts from the perimeter Wednesday night, Bojan Bogdanovic and Donovan Mitchell led a 3-point spree in the fourth quarter to help the Jazz to a 103-95 victory. Bogdanovic scored 30 points, Mitchell added 26 and the Jazz split the home-and-home series. ""I thought we touched a little bit tonight about the way we can play,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We were able to generate some 3s, and obviously Bojan. We had two stretches where it was tough for us and I thought our guys responded when the game got close."" Bogdanovic and Mitchell each hit three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. Bogdanovic was 6 of 11 from 3-point range, and Mitchell 5 of 10 to help Utah rebound for the home loss to Minnesota on Monday night. Minnesota led by six in the fourth quarter before Utah used a 12-0 run to take the lead for good. Mitchell hit a 3 with 5:09 left to give the Jazz a six-point lead. ""It all started with us penetrating the lane and having eyes out for our shooters,"" Jeff Green said. ""We have the shooters and if they try to take away one thing with a lob to Rudy (Gobert), it leaves shooters open. . It was big time for us."" Andrew Wiggins had 22 points for Minnesota after missing three games because of personal reasons and an illness. Karl-Anthony Towns was held to 14 points and struggled with foul trouble most of the night. It was a far cry from Monday night, when Towns hit tied a career-high with seven 3s and had 29 points in Minnesota's 112-102 win. On Wednesday, he didn't hit double figures until a 3 with 4:34 remaining, but Utah answered with back-to-back triples from Bogdanovic and Mike Conley to make it 94-85 at the 3:28 mark. ""You can tell . there was an emphasis on taking Karl out of it,"" Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Conley had 16 points for the Jazz, and Gobert had 12 points and 15 rebounds. Utah led by nine before Kelan Martin keyed a 12-0 run that put the Wolves up early in the fourth. WIGGINS' RETURN: Wiggins was listed as questionable earlier in the day, still feeling some effects from his illness, before deciding to give it a go. He looked sharp at times, although Saunders said he tried to give him a rest in the fourth. ""There was definitely some getting back into the swing of things,"" Saunders said. Wiggins finished 10 for 24 from the field, including 1 for 10 from 3-point range. He said his energy level felt better than his shots. ""Just missed a lot of easy shots, a lot of shots that I usually make, or would feel better. They didn't feel as good today,"" Wiggins said. MITCHELL'S FAN EXPERIENCE Mitchell bounced back after a sub-par night Monday when he scored 17 points on 5 for 23 shooting. He credited a trash-talking Minnesota fan for some extra motivation. ""I just said, `just wait because eventually it'll happen,"" Mitchell said. ""I think it's just one of those things you just have to have fun with in the game. I thank him because I was kind of struggling."" TIP-INS: Jazz: Gobert blocked five shots for the second time in three games. ... The Jazz took advantage of early foul trouble for Towns and Wiggins and jumped to an 11-point lead in the first quarter. Utah led by 11 before Minnesota tightened up defensively and reclaimed the lead with a 20-4 run. ... Ed Davis missed his eighth game with a fractured left fibula. Timberwolves: The perimeter wasn't the only place the Wolves struggled; Minnesota went 11 for 21 from the foul line. ... Saunders was given a technical in the first quarter. .... Shabazz Napier (hamstring) missed his ninth game. F Jake Layman (toe) was inactive after leaving Monday's game in the second quarter.","401160852"
"DENVER --  Rule No. 1 in defending James Harden: Throw different looks at him. Rule No. 2: See above. At least, that was Denver's highly effective blueprint. Nikola Jokic had 27 points and 12 rebounds, Denver played smothering defense on Harden and the Nuggets beat Houston 105-95 on Wednesday night to snap the Rockets' eight-game winning streak. ""You have to have rules against James Harden,"" Denver coach Michael Malone explained. ""You can't play him with your standard defense. Great player defense is required for great players."" So, the Nuggets tried a little bit of everything to contain Harden, even rolling the 7-foot Jokic out high along with another defender. The variety of schemes did the trick -- as much as it can against Harden. Houston's star playmaker finished with 27 points, snapping his string of eight consecutive games with 36 or more. He was 8 of 16 from the floor as the Rockets were held under 100 points for the first time this season. They were averaging an NBA-best 119.5 per game. ""We were locked in,"" said Jokic, whose team is 7-0 this season when keeping an opponent below 100 points. Still, Jokic found it funny that his team was being lauded for ""stopping"" Harden. ""That's crazy when a guy scores 27 and it's bad,"" Jokic said. ""We know he's going to score. He's going to be aggressive. Just make it harder and try to be there. ... Just to give them different looks."" It worked -- this time. ""They just double-teamed every possession,"" Harden said. ""They got lucky. They got away with one. We didn't execute how we needed to."" The Rockets struggled from 3-point range, hitting 12 of 38. They did make at least 10 for a 71st straight game dating to last season. Russell Westbrook finished with 25 points on 8-of-22 shooting and Clint Capela grabbed 21 rebounds. ""We had open shots,"" Westbrook said. ""We just didn't make them."" Will Barton scored 15 points, while Torrey Craig and Juancho Hernangomez provided boosts off the bench as Denver's reserves outscored the Rockets' backups by a 32-21 margin. One of the key sequences came in the third quarter, when Paul Millsap blocked Harden's shot and Barton turned it into a dunk on the other end. That energized the Pepsi Center crowd and sent the Nuggets on a pivotal run. It's not easy making things difficult for Harden, who's seen just about every defensive scheme imaginable. ""He's one of those guys that when you're watching film it's like watching a horror movie,"" Malone said. ""He's that talented."" TIP-INS Rockets: F Danuel House Jr. hurt his shoulder after running through a screen set by Jokic in the third quarter. House will be evaluated Thursday. ... G Ben McLemore was given a flagrant foul for a push in the fourth. Nuggets: Gary Harris and Jamal Murray each scored 10 points. CRAIG'S D Craig played a big role with three blocked shots in helping to limit Westbrook's damage. Craig knew he was getting under his opponent's skin when Westbrook lobbied to officials for foul calls. ""That's kind of a sign that I'm getting on his nerves a little bit,"" said Craig, who also turned in an impressive dunk. SPURTS The first quarter was filled with plenty of spurts -- a 7-0 run by Denver, soon followed by a 13-0 run for Houston and then a 15-0 run by the Nuggets. ELITE CATEGORY Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni sees Jokic in the same sort of category as Harden or Westbrook in being difficult to contain. ""He's going to do what he does. Same as James,"" D'Antoni said. ""I don't care what they do to James -- if he has a good game, it's because of James. If he has a bad game, it's because of James. Same with Russell. There are a few players that are that special."" NO FOULS Trying not to foul Harden is easier said than done. He drew a foul on a 3-pointer the Nuggets challenged, believing he kicked out his left leg, but the call on the floor stood. Harden was 7 of 10 from the free throw line. ""He's a master at drawing the foul,"" Malone said. ""They changed NBA rules because of James Harden.""","401160853"
"LOS ANGELES --  With Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Lou Williams on the court, the Boston Celtics had to pick someone to leave unguarded. They chose Patrick Beverley and he made them pay. Beverley shined on both ends, playing his usual ornery defense while scoring 14 points and grabbing a career-high 16 rebounds to help the Los Angeles Clippers win 107-104 in overtime with Leonard and George playing together for the first time Wednesday night. ""If I was a coach, I'd leave me open all the time,"" Beverley said. Williams scored 27 points, George added 25 and Leonard had 17 for the Clippers, who improved to 9-1 at home after rallying from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. In their first season with Los Angeles, injury and rehab had prevented Leonard and George from playing alongside each other for the first 14 games. ""It's still tough,"" said Leonard, who missed the previous three games with a sore knee. ""We're both on kind of minute restrictions so it's hard to get a flow."" George said he and Leonard are trying to get in sync with their other teammates. ""We're going to have growing pains,"" he said. ""The great thing about myself and Kawhi is it doesn't matter, we're going to play basketball. Try to make the right plays and play off each other and just keep the game flowing. I thought in that aspect we were good."" It was a wild and sloppy game for both teams. The Clippers committed 23 turnovers (Williams had seven while Leonard and George had five each) to 17 for the Celtics. ""That was an ugly win, but it was beautiful,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Leonard blocked Kemba Walker's potential tying 3-point attempt in the left corner. ""He got enough separation to get it off against most of the league,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""The problem is, that guy's not normal. He's not most of the league, and he made a great play to block it."" In overtime, George hit a 3-pointer after he missed his first attempt and Beverley got the offensive rebound, then George fed Beverley for a 3 of his own. George's free throw on a technical foul against Stevens completed a run of seven straight points, and the Clippers led 104-99. ""He literally singlehandedly willed that game with his effort, rebounding, making plays,"" Rivers said of Beverley, who got the game ball. ""He's a tough kid."" The Celtics pulled to 104-102 on Jayson Tatum's basket after a wild sequence in which bodies crashed to the floor as both teams chased a loose ball before Boston got possession. ""Defensive mistakes, costly turnovers,"" Tatum said. ""If we would have won it still would have been a learning experience."" Beverley hit a 3-pointer from the corner in front of the Clippers' bench for 107-102 lead, revving up Los Angeles fans and quieting the large contingent of Celtics fans in the stands. ""It was a playoff atmosphere,"" said Marcus Smart, who had 14 points for Boston. Tatum's basket left the Celtics down by three. Walker, who had 13 points, got free in the corner for the last shot but Leonard leaped to deflect it. Tatum led the Celtics with 30 points and Brad Wanamaker added 14. Williams hit a go-ahead 3 with 31 seconds remaining in regulation. With the crowd on its feet shouting ""Defense! Defense!"" Williams stole the ball at the other end and got fouled, making both for a 97-94 lead. After a timeout, Tatum hit a 3-pointer with George falling down defending him to tie it 97-all with 13 seconds left. Leonard's potential game-winning 3 rattled in and out as regulation ended. ""We've got some kinks to work out,"" Williams said. ""Just understanding what everybody brings to the table."" The Celtics led by 10 early in the fourth but got outscored 13-7 over the final 3:16. Boston missed 17 of 18 3-pointers in the first half. The Celtics then made seven 3s in the third quarter, with Tatum hitting four, to go into the fourth leading 75-69. Walker's 3-pointer pushed the Celtics to their largest lead, 86-76, in the fourth. The Clippers ran off eight points in a row, getting 3s from Beverley and Williams, to trail 86-84. Neither team led by more than 10 points in the game. Leonard and George combined to score the Clippers' first 11 points of the third for a 51-45 lead. That's when the Celtics kicked in from long range, with Tatum hitting back-to-back 3-pointers and Walker following with another. Tatum connected on consecutive 3s later in the period, too. TIP-INS Celtics: They dominated in the paint, 52-32. ... Daniel Theis had 14 rebounds and five fouls. Clippers: Their bench outscored the Celtics' reserves 43-29. ... The teams were even on the boards with 53 apiece. DUNK THIS Leonard got around Smart on his way to the basket and dunked one-handed over Theis in the fourth. ""That's Finals MVP,"" George said. ""He knows when it's time to take over. He's been there."" MANY MINUTES Leonard and George each played 37 minutes, which is more than Rivers would have liked. George had been kept around 28-30 since returning. ""This is preseason for me in terms of my condition and getting speed and playing at this level,"" George said. ""I was a little winded.""","401160854"
"MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee crowd greeted Carmelo Anthony with a loud ovation when the 10-time All-Star was introduced before the game. It cheered louder after the Bucks extended their winning streak to six straight. Giannis Antetokounmpo had his second triple-double of the season and Milwaukee beat Anthony and the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers 137-129 on Thursday night. ""Giannis is Giannis,"" Anthony said about the reining MVP. ""He's a tough check. I thought tonight we actually did a pretty good job. Even though he had a triple-double, when you look at that, it's like `Oh, he had a hell of a game.' But I thought, for the most part, we were back on him. We loaded up on him. He got some and-1s, he got going a little bit. ... He found some guys, they made some 3s, kind of opened the game up."" Antetokounmpo had 24 points, 19 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists to lead the Bucks to their seventh win in the last nine games against Portland. ""I couldn't get going offensively,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Shots weren't falling and they were showing a lot of crowds. I tried to find my teammates and they were in the right spots. They were able to knock down shots and to roll hard. I just did half of the work and my teammates did the rest."" Antetokounmpo, who also had a triple-double in the season opener, became the first player in franchise history to record a game with 20 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists. The 6-foot-11 forward has 16 career triple-doubles. Milwaukee is 14-2 in those games. Eric Bledsoe added 30 points and six assists in the Bucks' highest-scoring game of the season. After scoring 10 points on 4-of-14 shooting in 24 minutes in his season debut Tuesday night against the Pelicans, Anthony had 10 points in the first half Thursday. Anthony finished with 18 points (6-of-15 shooting) and seven rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who were without Hassan Whiteside (hip), Damian Lillard (back), Zach Collins (shoulder) and Jusuf Nurkic (leg). ""He's getting his sea legs after having that year off,"" Portland guard CJ McCollum said about Anthony. ""Getting used to that movement, getting used to how the game is flowing."" McCollum scored 37 points and Skal Labissiere added 22 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks for Portland. The Trail Blazers lost their third straight game overall and their sixth straight in Milwaukee. The Bucks made their first seven shots, including three 3s, and led 17-6. Milwaukee never trailed. The Bucks also had their highest first-half total, leading 72-58. The Blazers used a 40-point third quarter to close the gap and pulled within 117-115 with just over 7:00 play. But Brook Lopez and Wes Matthews hit back-to-back 3s to seal the Bucks victory. ""I thought we competed,"" McCollum said. ""I thought we played hard. Obviously, we came up short. But I thought it was a step in the right direction."" Milwaukee made 21 of 26 free throws against 12 of 14 for the Trail Blazers and outrebounded Portland 58-41. ""Keep in mind, their starting center (Lopez) didn't even get a rebound,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""So they did all that rebounding without even their center getting it. So they got them from a lot of different positions. We have to be aware of it. We can't assume that anybody else is going to get it. We don't have one guy that's going to go snatch all the rebounds. We gotta do it with five guys."" TIP-IN Antetokounmpo made his first career NBA start against Anthony. The date was Dec. 18, 2013. Giannis had 10 points and seven rebounds before fouling out. Carmelo scored 29 points in New York's victory.","401160855"
"PHOENIX --  Saddled with four fouls and struggling with his shot, Brandon Ingram stayed aggressive. It worked out quite well. Ingram scored 15 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and JJ Redick had 26 points, leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 124-121 win over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. ""Just seeing what the defense was giving me. I was forcing it a little bit in the first half,"" Ingram said. ""Not letting the game come to me. I tried to open up the floor a little bit by passing it to my teammates for shot on the wings, then finally finding attack space and knocking down shots."" Jrue Holiday had 23 points and nine assists for the Pelicans, who earned their third straight win. E'Twaun Moore added a season-high 19 points. Ingram's drive and strong finish at the rim while being fouled helped New Orleans open a 122-115 lead with 1:25 to play. But a technical foul, a turnover and a foul on a 3-pointer gave Phoenix a little hope. Holiday missed two free throws with 0.5 seconds to play, giving the Suns a chance to tie after a quick timeout. But the Suns couldn't get a good shot up. ""Anytime you can win on the road it's a great win, but obviously we have to do much better than that,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We have to be smarter down the stretch."" Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 25 points in its third consecutive loss. Devin Booker had 19 for the short-handed Suns, who were without starting center Aron Baynes and starting point guard Ricky Rubio. The Pelicans held the lead in the fourth quarter from start to finish. Phoenix got as close as two points down at 117-115 with 2:22 remaining. Ingram then made a turnaround jumper before his big three-point play, helping New Orleans pull away again. The Pelicans made their first 10 shots of the third quarter to take an 83-76 lead, with Redick scoring 10 points in that run. New Orleans didn't miss a shot until the 5:34 mark, but lost the lead briefly before carrying a 95-94 advantage into the fourth. ""We came out (in the third) and I think they scored 15 points in four minutes,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""There's no scheme for that, you just have to be more locked into the game."" Kenrich Williams' layup -- his only two points of the game -- off a pass from Ingram put the Pelicans ahead 105-96 at the 10:18 mark of the fourth quarter. Oubre's 3 at the second-quarter buzzer gave the Suns their largest lead of the half at 66-59. Oubre blew kisses to the crowd after the shot. He had 17 first-half points. Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball came off the bench and had eight points and five assists in his first game since Nov. 8. Ball had been dealing with a strained groin. ARENA PROJECT UNVEILED The Suns unveiled renderings and details of the planned renovation of Talking Stick Resort Arena during a pregame event at the nearby Phoenix Convention Center. Suns managing partner Robert Sarver went over the numerous upgrades for the Suns' home, which opened in 1992. The $230 million project is a joint effort between the team and Phoenix city government. ""Most importantly, (the project) will feature state-of-the-art improvements that will allow us to deliver a world-class guest experience to all of our great fans,"" Sarver said in a statement from the team.

"DETROIT --  About an hour after a blowout loss to the Detroit Pistons, Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce finally emerged to meet with reporters. The Hawks had been talking things over. ""Learning how to compete -- that's kind of it,"" Pierce said. ""Learning how to compete, learning how to communicate, what it takes to win in the NBA, what it takes to be a pro."" Atlanta allowed 76 points in the first two quarters -- the highest-scoring first half for the Pistons since 1983 -- and Detroit snapped a five-game losing streak with a 128-103 rout Friday night. It was the fifth straight loss for the Hawks and their eighth consecutive game allowing at least 120 points. Coaches generally hold their media sessions about 10 minutes after the game ends, but that was delayed a while this time. The Hawks were meeting to try to find some answers to their struggles. ""We've got a bunch of guys that don't really get to talk and actually say what they think,"" said DeAndre' Bembry, who led the team in scoring with 22 points. ""That was definitely one of those meetings where we're just expressing ourself, individually and collectively."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 15 rebounds for the Pistons. Detroit led 76-57 at halftime, and the Pistons reached 100 points with over five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Nine different Detroit players made at least one 3-pointer. Drummond wasn't one of them, but he scored his share of easy baskets inside. The Pistons actually trailed 17-7 before going on a 20-0 run that gave them a double-digit lead of their own before the end of the first quarter. It was 33-23 after one, then Detroit overwhelmed the Hawks with a 43-point second quarter that ended when Thon Maker of the Pistons made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""We're such a good shooting team, if we get good attempts and not turn it over,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. It was the most points in the first half for the Pistons since they scored 77 on Dec. 2, 1983, also against the Hawks. Detroit led 107-84 after three and finished the game with seven players in double figures. Blake Griffin scored 24 points and Bruce Brown added 14. Markieff Morris contributed 13 points. The Pistons shot 60 percent from the field and 17 of 34 from 3-point range. Pierce was asked if he got the response he wanted from the postgame meeting, but that remains to be seen. ""Nothing gets solved in those meetings, but what has to be said -- if you see something, you've got to say it,"" Pierce said. ""I had to say it, and they had to say it, and they had to hear it."" NOT THIS TIME Trae Young scored 38 points for Atlanta in a win at Detroit last month. He had only nine Friday, and Brown outscored him. ""Just ready tonight,"" Brown said. ""I don't think I was ready last time."" INJURIES Detroit is still without point guard Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction), and Tony Snell (left hip strain) missed this game as well. Atlanta was missing rookie Cam Reddish (left wrist sprain), as well as Kevin Huerter (left rotator cuff strain) and John Collins (doping suspension). TIP-INS Hawks: De'Andre Hunter scored 18 points and Jabari Parker added 14. Pistons: Detroit had not scored 76 points in either half since the Pistons scored 76 in the second half against Washington on Feb. 7, 1995. ... Langston Galloway scored 12 points, giving him a career-best 11 consecutive games in double figures. ... The 20-0 run was the team's longest since a 24-0 run at Portland on Nov. 8, 2015.","401160857"
"WASHINGTON --  The Washington Wizards defense remains a soft spot. At least its rising to the occasion lately. Bradley Beal had 30 points and 12 assists, Thomas Bryant added 21 points and 11 rebounds, and the Wizards overcame a 13-point deficit with a stingy fourth quarter in their 125-118 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. Davis Bertans added 20 points off the bench, hitting six 3-pointers as the Wizards won two in a row for the first time this season. Jordan McCrae scored eight of his 13 in the fourth, including a baseline 3 that put Washington in front for good. It was important -- it was beyond important, Beal said about the victory. For one, just protecting our house. But two, it gives us a little bit of flow, some juice moving forward. The Hornets were on pace to set a season high for points until the Wizards held Charlotte to 22 in the fourth quarter while forcing eight turnovers. A game earlier, a team that holds the NBAs second-worst defensive rating limited San Antonio to one field goal over a 5:43 stretch of the third period during a decisive run. Those are steps for us in the right direction, Beal said. Weve still got to get those points down. Were still giving up way too many points. Beal extended his career-best streak of scoring 30 or more to five games as the Wizards snapped a three-game skid against the Hornets. Miles Bridges had a career-high 31 points for Charlotte, which has now lost at least three in a row for a third time this season. Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier and Malik Monk each added 19 for the Hornets. Down 13 early in the fourth after Charlottes 11-2 run, Washington replied with 11 straight points and ultimately outscored the Hornets 29-9 down the stretch. I think their physicality picked up, Charlotte coach James Borrego said. We started turning the ball over too much. Just something weve got to continue to work on. Bertans hit his final 3 off Beals feed to close the margin to four, and Beal drove the lane, got fouled and sank a pair of free throws to make it 109-107 with 6:13 left. Several possessions later, Bertans spotted McCrae for a baseline 3 to put Washington up 116-114. And later, McCraes contested runner just about sealed the win, making it 122-116 with 29 seconds remaining. Just playing off Brad, McCrae said. Hes doing a lot out there -- handling, guarding, scoring for us. So for us, weve got to be ready to shoot when he throws it. TIP-INS Hornets: Went 8 for 15 (53%) from 3-point range in the first half.  Despite being 16 games into the season, this was Charlottes first against a Southeast Division rival. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks played a starting five of Beal, Bryant, Troy Brown Jr., Rui Hachimura and Isaiah Thomas for the sixth time, his most-used combination this season.  Moritz Wagners buzzer-beating 3 pulled Washington to 34-33 at the end of the first quarter.  Bertans tied his career high for 3-pointers. BENCH BONANZA Washington entered with the NBAs second-highest scoring bench and built upon that with a 50-point showing. Bertans, McCrae and Ish Smith were among those second-unit players still on the floor down the stretch. I think thats big for our team, McCrae said. Our team is deep. Anytime, the coach can go with anybody. That just is a testament for guys on the bench to be ready at all times. BRIDGES BREAKOUT Bridges, a second-year pro, easily eclipsed his previous career high of 23 points set in October and it marked only the third time in 96 games hes reached 20 points. The secret?

Then my shot started falling and just went from there.","401160858"
"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets usually do well when they hold opponents under 100 points. They did it again Friday night for the second straight game. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 23 points and Joe Harris added 22 in the Nets' 116-97 victory over the Sacramento Kings. Brooklyn is 34-6 under coach Kenny Atkinson when keeping opponents under 100. ""We're just trying to play good basketball, play the right way,"" Harris said. ""We've done a better job here lately defensively. When you're able to get stops, things offensively come a lot easier."" Garrett Temple finished with 18 points, Jared Allen had 11 points and nine rebounds, and DeAndre Jordan added 10 rebounds for the Nets. Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 18 points. Buddy Hield had 16, Justin James 14, Nemanja Bjelica 13 and Richaun Holmes 12 as Sacramento shot 4 of 26 from 3-point range. ""If you're a 3-point shooting team and you shoot 15 percent, you're not going to win a lot of games,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""Brooklyn also beat us up on the glass."" The Nets outrebounded the Kings 48-33, matching their highest differential of the season. Temple's 3-pointer opened the scoring and Brooklyn never trailed in the game. Leading 26-23 after the first quarter, the Nets began the second on a 17-8 run to open a 12-point lead at 43-31. The Kings, with Hield scoring 14 first-half points, pulled within seven at halftime, 56-49. Temple's 3-pointer capped a 10-2 run and gave the Nets a 15-point lead, 66-51. The Kings were able to get back within 10 points at 72-62, but Dzanan Musa's two free throws with 39 seconds left gave the Nets a 16-point lead after three quarters. ""Looking at all our games before this, the third quarter was really our crutch,"" Allen said. ""Now we're getting rid of it and we're running full speed."" Jordan's dunk midway through the fourth made it a 22-point advantage at 104-82. ""I think our defense was outstanding again,"" Atkinson said. ""We talked about it pregame. I thought they were active, just a lot of deflections, forcing turnovers, so that's good news.""

"Joel Embiid contends that he will no longer participate in trash talking because the 76ers need him to be on the floor. (0:38) PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia coach Brett Brown met Gregg Popovich at midcourt, gave him a handshake, hug and pat on the back. Brown knows all about long losing streaks, and Popovich helped him get through them. Now it's Brown's turn to help. Tobias Harris scored 26 points, Joel Embiid had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat San Antonio 115-104 on Friday night to hand the Spurs their eighth consecutive defeat. The skid is the Spurs' worst under longtime coach Popovich. ""Figured it was something like that,"" Popovich said. A former Spurs assistant under Popovich, Brown endured an NBA-record 28-game losing streak during Philadelphia's rebuilding project early in his tenure. Usually loquacious, Brown didn't have much to say about sending his mentor to the longest skid of his career. ""I love him. He knows that,"" Brown said. ""He coaches hard, he moves on."" Ben Simmons had a triple-double with 10 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, who improved to 6-0 at home. DeMar DeRozan had 29 points and Rudy Gay scored 22 for the Spurs. ""I thought the effort was good, just a bad start again,"" Popovich said. ""We're just trying to not make as many mistakes, mostly at the defensive end because it always puts us in a bad way. We're working at it."" DeRozan said Popovich has remained positive despite the losing streak. ""He's extremely optimistic, doesn't panic,"" DeRozan said. ""He keeps our spirits up high, keeps our confidence up high. Got to keep our heads up."" San Antonio last dropped eight in a row in November 1996 under coach Bob Hill. Popovich was the team's general manager at the time. He fired Hill later that season and began his long run of success. In his 24th season, Popovich has won five NBA titles and gone to the playoffs in 22 straight seasons while compiling a winning record in each of those 22 campaigns. He has spent just 74 days with a losing record over the past 22 seasons. Prior to the recent slump, Popovich hadn't lost seven consecutive games since Feb. 23 to March 5, 1997. ""He felt sorry for me in my early years,"" Brown said. ""He's amazing. His competitiveness is incredibly admirable. Nothing I respect more that Pop has achieved than longevity."" Popovich said the sting of losing was slightly lessened due to the opponent. ""If you lose to [Brown], for some strange reason it doesn't hurt quite as bad,"" he said. ""You're a little bit happy for him -- just a little."" San Antonio trailed most of the way but got within one late in the third quarter before the 76ers pulled away in the fourth. It was 101-95 with just under six minutes left when Popovich elected to intentionally foul Simmons for the second straight trip down court. A 58% free throw shooter, Simmons missed both attempts the first time but drained both shots on his subsequent trip to the line to put Philadelphia ahead 103-95 with 5:34 remaining. Furkan Korkmaz hit a 3-pointer from the corner on Philadelphia's next possession and then Harris made a layup to put the 76ers comfortably ahead, 108-97, with 4:24 left. BROWN BACKER The pressure has intensified on Brown after the team's early playoff exits the last two seasons and a so-so start to 2019-20. Brown acknowledged as much before the game, saying his job ""has been in question since the day I took it."" However, Popovich doesn't believe Brown should be receiving scrutiny. Brown spent 11 seasons with the Spurs. ""Fans don't know crap,"" Popovich said. ""He's one hell of a guy and the most positive guy I've ever known. He's going to work his ass off. They are lucky to have him."" TIP-INS Spurs: Derrick White (left foot) missed his second consecutive game. 76ers: Josh Richardson (right hip flexor) didn't play. ...

"CHICAGO --  Jimmy Butler is turning into a perfectionist. Butler had 27 points against his former team and the Miami Heat beat the Chicago Bulls 116-108 on Friday night for their fifth straight victory. Butler played for the Bulls from 2011-17. He was 7 of 10 from the field and had seven assists and five rebounds Bam Adebayo added 16 points and 14 rebounds, and Kendrick Nunn scored 13 of his 21 points in the first quarter to help Miami improve to 11-3. The Heat led wire-to-wire and had as much as a 26-point lead. Despite a 11-3 record and a five-game winning streak, Butler wasn't happy to see the lead dwindle to single digits in the fourth quarter. ""A win is a win. I'm not going to downplay that none, but I think the way we have been winning is not the way we would like to win. We played great basketball in the first half. I think we are all proud of that, but then we just have these mental lapses night after night. It just can't happen if we want to be as good as we say we want to be,"" said Butler. Zach Lavine led the Bulls who finished with 15 points. Chicago is 3-6 at home this season. Bulls coach Jim Boylen pulled LaVine and the other starters midway through the first quarter. ""I just pulled him. Not combative. Guys know. Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen and our starters got to play better for us to become what we can become. That's how it works,"" Boylen said. ""I want him to be a two-way player. That's what I want him to be."" LaVine thought he was used as the scapegoat for the Bulls' struggles. ""I guess I was to blame for it,"" LaVine said. ""I've gotten pulled early before by him. I guess that's just his thing to do. Just got to take it in stride. I'm not the coach."" Nunn, making his Chicago homecoming, scored 13 points in the first quarter on 5-for-7 shooting. Nunn blew by Markkanen several times and was 3-of-5 from 3-point range in the quarter. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was concern how Nunn would handle his return to Chicago after watching Dwyane Wade struggle in his first few games in Chicago. ""When he has 40 points or if he has zero points, what his facial expression and body language looks like, it would look the same, so I don't know why I even though it potentially could be an issue with him,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's a very serious guy about this game and approach. He understands this is a tremendous opportunity for him and our team. He's gone through a lot and overcome a lot to get to this point and he's trying to take advantage of everything as well as he should."". NO PHILLY LOVE? Butler returns to Philadelphia on Saturday after playing 55 games for the 76ers last season. Butler was traded last to the 76ers from Minnesota. Butler he isn't sure how the Philly crowd will react, nor does he care. ""To tell you the truth, I don't care. I was there and gave my all for them,"" Butler said. ""But I'm here so however they want to welcome me back. We're (there) to do a job anyway, trying to get a W."" TIP-IN The Bulls played without Chandler Hutchison and Otto Porter. Hutchison is out with shin splits and Porter is out with a left foot sprain. The Heat played without Justise Winslow, who was out with a concussion. ...

"LeBron James admits missing his son Bronny Jr.'s high-school debut was ""bittersweet,"" but is appreciative of technology for being able to stream the game. (0:30) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Being coachable paid off for Anthony Davis. The star forward scored 24 of his 33 points in the second half to help the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 130-127 on Friday night. He got in a rhythm after coach Frank Vogel told him to stop hesitating. ""When I hesitate, I tend to come up short or a bad miss,"" Davis said. ""And it seems to be going in a lot more when I don't hesitate."" Davis also had 11 rebounds and seven assists, and the Lakers needed all of it. Though the Thunder have struggled this season, they played the Lakers close this week in Los Angeles and entered the night with a 5-3 home record, including a victory over Philadelphia last week. ""We find a way to win no matter what the game is,"" said LeBron James, who had 23 points and 14 assists. ""This is a very good team at home. They've struggled on the road a little bit, but we knew they were going to give it their best punch, especially just playing them on Tuesday in LA."" The Lakers won their sixth straight and own the league's best record at 13-2. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and Steven Adams added 22 for the Thunder, who have lost five of six. Los Angeles guard Rajon Rondo was ejected early in the fourth quarter after a kick to Dennis Schroder's groin area. Schroder made two free throws, and then Gilgeous-Alexander's layup tied the game at 109. ""I didn't think it called for an ejection, but the refs have to do what they feel best fits,"" James said. ""But, you know, I didn't think it called for an ejection."" Davis hit a corner 3 and was fouled by Adams, then made the free throw to put the Lakers ahead 126-121 with 2:36 to play. Oklahoma City's Chris Paul made a layup with 11.8 seconds left that cut the Lakers' lead to 126-125. Davis was fouled with 8.1 seconds left, and he made both free throws. Gilgeous-Alexander's layup with 4.2 seconds left trimmed the margin to one again, but Davis made two more free throws with 3.8 seconds remaining. James intercepted Oklahoma City's inbounds pass and ran out the clock. ""Credit OKC,"" Vogel said. ""They played an outstanding game tonight on both ends of the floor. They really competed and made big shots all night."" It was Oklahoma City's seventh loss by five points or fewer this season. ""Yeah, it's kind of stupid, to tell you the truth,"" Paul said. ""Don't know if that's the right word, but me and Shai was talking about like, you know, we are fighting. This is our job. We are supposed to (win), so we've got to figure it out.

"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic finally had a chance to give former teammate Dirk Nowitzki a live look at how the Dallas Mavericks are coming along without the best player in franchise history. Not too bad so far. Doncic had 30 points and 14 assists with Nowitzki watching courtside next to owner Mark Cuban, and the Mavericks won by more than 40 points for the second straight game, routing the Cleveland Cavaliers 143-101 on Friday night. Nowitzki stayed away for the first eight Dallas home games after setting an NBA record of 21 seasons with the same franchise while finishing last season as the highest-scoring foreign-born player in league history. The big German got a standing ovation when shown on the video board in what was also his first peek in person at Dallas' new European pairing of Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, the 7-foot-3 Latvian who missed his five shots but made his last six, finishing with 17 points. ""I'm here to make this franchise, make this team a better team,"" said Porzingis, who also had four blocks in his 200th career game. ""I'm trying to do my part. I'm sure Luka's trying to do his part. He's doing it well. ""As I said before, those are some huge shoes that we have to fill with Dirk ending his career and how high he set the standard for this organization."" Rookie Darius Garland scored a career-high 23 points for the Cavaliers, who lost their sixth straight game while getting swept in a second consecutive season series against Dallas. Cleveland lost at home by 20 early this month. ""They can really shoot,"" coach John Beilein said. ""The couple of shots that Porzingis made and Luka made, you can't defend them. They're stepping back, they've got great size and they're shooting it in from 30 feet. Really a talented team."" Dallas (10-5) moved five games above .500 for the first time since late in the 2015-16 season, which ended up being Nowitzki's final trip to the playoffs after leading the franchise to its only championship in 2011. Nowitzki gave a hint that he might be on the way by tweeting about the traffic near his old home arena on the street that was renamed in his honor before the season started. ""Awesome,"" coach Rick Carlisle about seeing Nowitzki in the arena, while quickly noting that Shawn Marion, also retired, and guard J.J. Barea were nearby. All three played important roles in the championship. Doncic is the first Dallas player to score at least 30 points in three straight games since Nowitzki in 2010, but is still waiting to record three straight triple-doubles for the first time. For the third time in the rookie of the year's two seasons, the 20-year-old Slovenian fell short, finishing with seven rebounds while sitting all of the fourth quarter for the second straight game. Porzingis also was on the bench the whole fourth two nights after Dallas led Golden State by 50 in the second half of a 142-94 win. The final margin of 42 was also the Mavericks' biggest lead against the Cavaliers in their first sweep of a four-game homestand since the title year. ""A lot of guys did a lot of good things,"" Carlisle said. ""It's a successful homestand, and we've done some good things. But the schedule's going to get a lot more difficult now.""

Murray scored 22 points, including two clutch free throws with 1.5 seconds remaining, and the Nuggets hung on to beat the Celtics 96-92 on Friday night in a game overshadowed by a head injury to Boston guard Kemba Walker. ""That's not something you want to mess around with,"" Murray said. ""Prayers out to him and hopefully he's fine."" Nikola Jokic added 18 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists for the Nuggets, who improved to 8-0 this season when holding an opponent to fewer than 100 points. Jaylen Brown had 22 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Celtics. Jayson Tatum added 16 points and Marcus Smart had 15. Walker collided with teammate Semi Ojeleye late in the second quarter, striking Ojeleye's abdomen area head-first and going down on to the court in a heap. Walker grimaced in pain as he went down and play was stopped as medical personnel from both teams tended to the star guard who was prone on the floor for several minutes. His teammates gathered round as did Nuggets players, plainly concerned about Walker. A brace was placed around his neck to stabilize the area and he was strapped to a backboard before being placed onto a gurney and wheeled off the court in front of a hushed crowd. ""I saw him in the ambulance at halftime,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""He had his wherewithal about him. He was in decent spirits, which is good."" In a tweet, the Celtics said Walker has been diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms and was transported to a hospital for further evaluation. Walker, the Celtics' leading scorer, had three assists and a pair of steals before leaving the game. ""Our prayers and our energy are with him,"" Brown said. ""He's probably the smallest dude on the floor every time he steps out, but he's probably got the biggest heart. We definitely lean on him and we'll welcome him back when he rests up and everything is taken care of."" Earlier this month, the Celtics lost Gordon Hayward to a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury when he collided with LaMarcus Aldridge in a Nov. 9 game against San Antonio. The Celtics, down by 19 in the third quarter and 13 to start the fourth, went on a 10-1 run capped by Brad Wanamaker's driving layup to pull to 75-73 with 5:35 left to play. Brown connected on a 3-pointer from the corner, pulling the Celtics to 84-83 with 2:18 remaining. Murray made a pair of free throws and hit a jumper around a Boston turnover as the Nuggets went in front 88-83. Boston added a basket but Paul Millsap connected on a 3-pointer, helping fend off the Celtics in the waning seconds. The Nuggets took their 70-57 lead into the fourth with Michael Porter Jr. punctuating the advantage by soaring above the rim to rebound a missed shot and slam it through the net in the final moments of the third. Denver led by 17 in the first half before the Celtics put together an 11-0 run in the second quarter, pulling to 45-34 at the half. TIP-INS Celtics: Hayward is making progress in his recovery from the broken left hand he suffered during a Nov. 9 game against San Antonio.

"LOS ANGELES --  Down five points with a minute to go, the Los Angeles Clippers turned to a trio of veterans. Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Lou Williams combined to outscore the Houston Rockets 10-2 the rest of the way and Leonard hit the winning jumper with 15 seconds remaining for a 122-119 victory Friday night. ""We made shots, got stops, we played with confidence,"" said Williams, who led the Clippers with 26 points -- all in the second half. Leonard finished with 24 points and George added 19 in the superstars' second game together. Montrezl Harrell had 18. ""We fight hard. We leave it all out there on the court,"" Harrell said. ""We never feel like we're out of a game."" P.J. Tucker's turnaround hook put the Rockets up by five with a minute left. George hit a 3-pointer to trim the margin to two, and JaMychal Green blocked Clint Capela's shot at the other end. Williams then drained a 3 from the right corner that gave the Clippers a 118-117 lead with 30 seconds remaining. James Harden made a pair of free throws for a one-point Houston lead before Leonard's pull-up jumper gave Los Angeles the lead for good. ""Lou set a great pick,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""All Kawhi needs is an inch and he got it."" Russell Westbrook missed at the other end and George got the rebound while getting fouled. He made both free throws with one second left to complete a wild finish and help the Clippers improve to a franchise-best 10-1 at home with their fourth win in a row overall. ""You got Lou, Kawhi and Paul George. They're going to be composed,"" Rivers said. ""They've been in big games. Each one made a big shot down the stretch."" Harden scored 37 points, making a career-high 11 3-pointers and sinking 14 of 18 free throws. He also had 12 assists. Westbrook added 22 points before fouling out late, and Capela had 17 points and 19 rebounds. Those three plus Tucker had at least four fouls. ""We didn't finish the way we needed to, obviously, but we were very, very confident,"" Harden said. The teams traded leads in the fourth with neither leading by more than four until the final 1 1/2 minutes. The Clippers are still honing their chemistry, having just gotten Leonard and George together in games. ""We're basically learning within these games, but there comes a time in the game where it feels like we find a way,"" George said. ""We execute at the right times. We find the stops we need at the right times."" Because of their schedule, the Clippers haven't been able to have full practices. Most of their work gets done at game-day shootaround. ""I think probably we get in a little rhythm in the fourth quarter,"" Leonard said. ""Not being able to practice with each other, when we go out there we start seeing what the opponent's doing on both ends of the floor and kind of just get into a rhythm. We play our best basketball in the fourth quarter. Everyone's trying to make shots, execute and play great defense."" There were none of the theatrics that marked their last meeting, an overtime win by the Rockets in Houston on Nov. 13. Harden scored 47 points, Rivers got ejected with his rival son Austin egging on the referees and Westbrook disparaged Patrick Beverley's defense on Harden. Beverley and Ivica Zubac were in foul trouble for the Clippers. The Rockets took their first lead of the game on Harden's 3-pointer during a 16-2 run, including 11 straight points, early in the third. He got fouled and made the free throw before hitting another 3 and Westbrook followed with one of his own that helped put the Rockets up 70-59. The Clippers regrouped and finished off the quarter on a 21-14 spurt to trail 84-80 going into the fourth. Williams scored 14 points in the period. The Clippers led by 14 in the second. That's when Houston closed on a 19-9 run to trail 55-51 at halftime. TIP-INS Rockets: They fell to 5-4 on the road. ... Harden and Westbrook are averaging 20-plus points per game.

Daniel House Jr. missed his fourth straight game with a sacral contusion. Clippers: Landry Shamet is off crutches but remains out with a high ankle sprain. NO TIME OUT The Rockets were annoyed that Doc Rivers was on the court trying to call a timeout during a play that resulted in a 3 in the closing seconds for Los Angeles. ""No one saw me,"" the coach said, referring to the referees. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said, ""We had three officials and nobody saw him out there so it is what it is. The whole team saw him out there. Everyone saw him out there. That was a big play."" NEW LOOK The Clippers wore their new city edition jerseys for the first time. They feature Los Angeles in an Old English font inspired by L.A. artist Mister Cartoon. The jersey is mostly white and black with hints of blue and red, a nod to the team's main colors. The city's name appeared on the court in Old English font and the court featured Los Angeles geography woven into its black border through lines mapping out the city's roads and highways. The Clippers will wear the uniforms at 16 other games this season, including on Christmas against the Lakers. ""I like them a lot,"" Williams said.","401160866"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Devin Booker had the ball, and a defensive switch left him staring at an old friend on the perimeter. Teammates spread out to give Booker the spacing he needed, and the dynamic guard drove to the hoop before stopping for a step-back jumper over 7-foot Karl-Anthony Towns. Booker got the best of Towns as the former Kentucky Wildcats tried to make up for their short-handed squads. Booker had 35 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, and the Phoenix Suns stopped a three-game slide by holding off the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 100-98 victory on Saturday. ""I try to find certain games, when to be aggressive, when to not, when to make a play for other people when two are guarding me,"" Booker said. ""Tonight, I got it going a little bit late."" Kelly Oubre Jr. added 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who played without starting point guard Ricky Rubio and center Aron Baynes due to injuries. Phoenix was clinging to a 98-95 lead when Towns missed a hurried 3-pointer with 9.2 seconds left from just inside the half-court line. Booker then iced the game with a pair of free throws. ""He's not afraid of the moment,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""You can take him for granted sometimes. But I don't. When you have a special player like that, you have to recognize it. I constantly talk to our guys about how he generates a lot of their open looks because of the attention that he draws."" Phoenix shot a season-low 34.4% from the field but tied a season low with seven turnovers. It also made 24 of 26 foul shots, outscoring Minnesota by 14 from the line. Towns had 31 points and 17 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who have lost four of five. Keita Bates-Diop scored a career-high 22 points, and Andrew Wiggins added 21. ""Just didn't follow our system, we didn't make shots,"" Towns said. ""It's obviously a little hard to get in rhythm when you ain't making anything. They didn't go through tonight."" Booker's 17 points in the third quarter helped Phoenix regain control after the Wolves tied the game. When Minnesota closed within two in the final minutes, Booker scored in the lane over Towns. Wiggins answered, but Booker was there on the other end for a pair of free throws. ""We ran everything through him on offense tonight,"" the Suns' Frank Kaminsky said. ""It was one of those nights you could tell he was being aggressive. Just getting him in actions, trying to get switches, get mismatches. And he was taking advantage of it."" ROTATION ISSUES Minnesota played without Robert Covington (personal reasons), Josh Okogie (left knee soreness), Jake Layman (left toe sprain) and Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain). It was the second time in four games Okogie has been out with the injury. Layman missed his second straight game. Treveon Graham was listed as available with a left arm contusion but didn't play. ""You can say they're three of our top four defenders, in a way,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said of Covington, Okogie and Graham. ""Or maybe our three best. They impact the game with activity, too."" TIP-INS Suns: Rubio was out of the lineup for the third time in four games with back spasms. Baynes, who has been starting in place of the suspended Deandre Ayton, missed his third straight game with a right hip flexor strain. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  One night after questioning his relationship with coach Jim Boylen, the Chicago Bulls' Zach LaVine came through with a big game. LaVine had a career-high 49 points, including the winning 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to give the Bulls a 116-115 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. He shot 17 for 28 from the field, including 13 for 17 on 3s to tie an NBA record. Only Golden State's Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson had previously made 13 from beyond the arc in an NBA game. The night before, LaVine was pulled from the game early in the first quarter after Miami had taken a 13-0 lead. After that 116-108 home loss, LaVine said he sensed a lack of trust from Boylen. All was forgotten after Saturday's spectacular individual performance and dramatic comeback. ""Like I've been saying, we've been playing good in stretches,"" LaVine said. ""We just executed to perfection down the stretch. Obviously, you know, we got blessed a little bit with some luck. We can take this energy and go on to the next game. ""Hopefully this is that turning point for us. Every team has it. This could be a big step for us in the right direction."" Rookie Coby White, who starred at the University of North Carolina and playing in front of hundreds of family and friends from his hometown of Goldsboro, N.C., added 28 points for Chicago. LaVine's late bucket ended a flurry for the Bulls, who trailed by five with less than 10 seconds left before Tomas Satoronsky hit a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds remaining. On the last play, LaVine scooped up the loose ball after White forced a turnover by Devonte Graham. ""Once I saw the ball on the ground I was going for it,"" said LaVine, who scooped up the basketball, stepped behind the 3-point line and fired in the game-winner. LaVine, who entered averaging 19.5 points per game, started his 17th straight game and hit his first three shots -- all 3s -- and two free throws for 11 points in the first 7 1/2 minutes of the game and stayed hot the rest of the night. ""I've always said Zach is a really good guy, and a good person and he wants to do well,"" Boylen said. ""He wants to help the team. ... My job is to push the guy to a place he can't take himself and that happens sometimes with tough conversations, meetings and maybe some uncomfortable moments but that's what my job is. The credit needs to go to him and his focus, energy and his effort. ""He is always good when we coach him and talk to him. He wants to play better, I want him to play better and I am really happy for him."" Terry Rozier III had a game-high 28 points for Charlotte. Marvin Williams scored 19 of his 21 points in the second half as the Hornets recovered from a 14-point deficit in the first half and led by 11 early in the fourth quarter. The Hornets were still ahead by seven at 112-105 with 32.1 seconds left. ""I mean that's just a tough, tough loss,"" said Graham, who had 18 points. ""Especially for me, turning the ball over right there in that situation. But Zach made an extreme shot and you just have to tip your hat to him for that."" Charlotte's previous six victories had come in games in which they had trailed by 10 or more points. And Saturday's game was seconds away from a seventh win after overcoming a double-digit deficit. ""There was a lot of good to get back in that game,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""I thought our guys played inspired. We won the boards and we won the paint. We did a number of things very well in this game. Gave ourselves a great shot, a great opportunity there, we just have not been able to close these last few games. ""You've got to give them credit. LaVine obviously made some incredible shots there down the stretch."" TIP INS: Bulls: When told pregame the NBA was considering changes that would alter the regular season and postseason schedules, Boylen offered his blanket support. ""I'm a huge Adam Silver fan and I'm going to worry about coaching my team,"" Boylen said of the league commissioner. ""If they feel that's best for the league and all of us, we're all reaping the benefits of what's been laid down by the league office. And I'll continue to trust that. Whatever they want, I'll support."" Hornets: Veteran swingman Nic Batum missed the first 11 games of the regular season after suffering a broken finger in his left hand in the preseason. Though he's been coming off the bench, Hornets coach James Borrego applauded Batum's return to his lineup before Saturday's game. ""He's done a good job,"" Borrego said. ""I think he's been a real asset for us on the defensive end. His length, his experience, playmaking, secondary play maker. He's getting his legs underneath him these last few games, so I think he's doing well.""","401160868"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  With the game on the line, Indianas Holiday brothers leaned on the chemistry theyve been building since childhood. Justin Holiday could have taken a contested shot to break a 106-all tie between the Pacers and the Orlando Magic, but instead he dished to younger brother Aaron, who despite missing his previous 3-pointers didnt hesitate to drill the go-ahead shot with 8.7 seconds remaining as Indiana beat Orlando 111-106 on Saturday night. Aaron said he hand his brother have practiced those scenarios for years. For sure, thats what we dreamed about when we were younger, Aaron said. Im obviously a confident guy. Hitting the 3 at the end, I was going to shoot it no matter what. Even though I missed the last few, one has got to go in for me. Justin drove to draw Aarons defender away before dishing to his brother. The missed shots dont matter at that point, Justin said. It was the right basketball play. I passed it to him and thought, Hes going to make this. Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 25 points, including 20 in the first three quarters, but the Magic led by two points entering the fourth. After Aarons clutch shot, Justin sealed the outcome when he recognized the Magics formation from the last time these teams played 13 days ago and intercepted the inbounds pass. He was fouled and hit two free throws for the final points. I was sitting there, waiting for it, Justin said. His brother expected more from that play. He did a great job on defense for us at the end of the game, Aaron said. He should have went in and dunked the ball, but well talk about that later. The Pacers have won six of seven at home and 11 of their past 13 against the Magic, who are winless in six road games. Evan Fournier scored 26 points and Jonathan Isaac had 25 for the Magic. We played well enough to win, Isaac said. It just sucks the way the game ended. The Magic lamented defensive breakdowns as the Pacers shot a season-best 54.4% (43 of 79), including 55.6% (10 of 18) in the final quarter. You have to make the coverages and schemes work, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Thats our whole mentality right there. If we get back to the point where permanent players decide they want to get into the ball and do what theyre supposed to do, then well have a better chance. The Pacers had six players score in double figures, including Aaron with 13 points and Justin with 12. TIP-INS Magic: The visitors didnt look like the NBAs worst 3-point shooting team, making 13 of 31 (41.9%) from beyond the arc. The last time these teams met, a 109-102 Pacers win on Nov. 10, the Magic hit a season-high 15 3-pointers. ... Orlando is averaging 13.1 turnovers per game, the second-best average in the league. Pacers: All-Star guard Victor Oladipo scrimmaged on Thursday, another positive step in his lengthy rehabilitation from surgery to repair a torn ACL that ended last season. No timetable has been announced for his return, but hes also worked out twice recently with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the G League. ... Point guard Malcolm Brogdon, sidelined for a third consecutive game with a sore back, joined the pregame shoot-around. MORE ON THE LINE The previous time these teams met, the Magic and Pacers made NBA history for fewest free throws combined at 11. They attempted 25 on Saturday.","401160869"
"ATLANTA --  Raptors coach Nick Nurse reminded his team at halftime to focus on getting stops and letting the defense spark the offense. ""That's the name of the game,"" guard Fred VanVleet said. ""We track how many consecutive stops we got. We came out of the half and had two stops, two 3s and just built from there."" Pascal Siakam scored 34 points and VanVleet had 25, helping the Toronto Raptors beat Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks 119-116 on Saturday night. Siakam, at 6-foot-9, 230 pounds, turned in another impressive performance, hurting the Hawks with mid-range jumpers and 3s. He has scored at least 30 in six games, one more than he had last season. Norman Powell added 20 points for defending champion Toronto in its third straight win. Young had 30 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in his second career triple-double, but Atlanta dropped its sixth straight game. The dynamic second-year guard hit two 3-pointers from 30-plus feet. ""It sucks that we lost, but if we play like, it's going to be tough to beat us,"" Young said. ""Obviously, we were down a couple of guys, but the way we played tonight, if we play like that, we can turn things around. We've got to do that every night."" Two nights after holding an opponent under 40 percent from the field for the sixth time this season, the defending NBA champion Raptors let Atlanta shoot nearly 53 percent. Hawks rookie De'Andre Hunter went 6 for 10 from 3-point range and finished with 26 points. VanVleet's 3 with 10:02 remaining gave Toronto its first lead since the final minute of the first quarter. The Raptors never trailed again. ""I thought we were thinking maybe it was going to be a little easier than you do on a normal NBA night, which is a mistake,"" Nurse said. ""I thought we played one-on-one early and didn't hustle back on D early and didn't execute our schemes very well. We were kind of chasing that, but saying that, sometimes you've got to find a way to win it, and give the guys all the credit in the world for that because it was a tough game. Siakam's layup at the 2:49 mark made it a 10-point advantage, but the Hawks pulled within four on Young's fast-break floater with 37.5 seconds to go. Siakam quickly answered with a dunk before Hunter hit a 3 with 24.8 seconds remaining. Hunter hit his sixth 3 to cut the lead to two, and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson made 1 of 2 foul shots. Young missed a 3 at the buzzer. Young hit a straightaway 3 from 36 feet to put the Hawks up 61-52 in the closing seconds before halftime. TIP-INS Raptors: F Serge Ibaka missed his seventh straight game with a right ankle sprain. Nurse said Ibaka is ""getting closer."" ... G Kyle Lowry missed his seventh straight game with a left thumb fracture. Nurse said Lowry could return next weekend. Lowry worked out on the floor before the game. Hawks: F Cam Reddish was sidelined by a left wrist sprain, missing his second straight game. Coach Lloyd Pierce said Reddish still can't grip the ball without pain. ... Young began the game as the only NBA player with top five averages in assists, points and steals. SERIES Toronto has won eight straight against the Hawks, including five in a row in Atlanta. BETTER SHOWING Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce convened a nearly hour-long team meeting following Friday's embarrassing loss at Detroit. He liked what he saw from his team a night later. ""We couldn't stop them, and that was really a difference, but I thought our guys competed even during that time for 48 minutes,"" Pierce said. ""Really just proud of the effort that everybody showed tonight.""","401160870"
"NEW YORK --  Gregg Popovichs longest losing streak as Spurs coach is over, though there was no celebration. Nor was there much despair while San Antonio lost the previous eight games. These guys, theyre too hardened and theyre all pros. Theyre grown men. Theyve got families and kids and that kind of stuff doesnt bother them, Popovich said. Nobody likes to lose a bunch of games, but its not going to debilitate them. Theyll still get their paychecks. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks 111-104 on Saturday night. The Spurs never trailed, led by as many as 28 and looked like the kind of team Popovich has usually had, not this one that has been one of the NBAs worst defensively. San Antonio was in control until deep into the second half, even while playing on the second night of back-to-back games to end a four-game road trip. I think everyone was definitely unhappy and frustrated, but youve got to change your own fate, Aldridge said. Youve got to find a way and tonight I thought we played better, played with more of a sense of urgency and got a win. DeMar DeRozan added 21 points and nine rebounds for the Spurs, who came in yielding 116.1 points per game but held the Knicks under 100 until the final 10 seconds of the game. Marcus Morris scored 20 points for the Knicks, who had played better in their last four games after a 2-9 start. I don't know how to explain it, coach David Fizdale said. We were in the mud and they were a desperate team. So, we got punched in the face and we dug a hole. The eight-game skid was the Spurs longest since early in the 1996-97 season under Bob Hill, when Popovich was the general manager. He replaced Hill later that season and the Spurs drafted Tim Duncan after it. Theyve since won five NBA titles during a record-tying 22 straight postseason appearances. Popovich shrugged off any interest in that or any other streak or achievement, saying all that mattered was working hard each night whether it was a win or a loss. Lately, it had been all losses, but there was never really a chance of one Saturday. The Spurs jumped to a 7-0 lead and it was never much of a game from there. They extended it to 26-9 later in the first quarter en route to a 32-16 lead after the period. There were noticeable boos when the Knicks took a timeout trailing 48-27, and they were a whole lot louder and angrier when the teams headed to the locker room with San Antonio holding a 68-43 halftime cushion. The Spurs shot 59% in the first half and held the Knicks to 4-for-16 shooting from 3-point range. Just a bad start, Knicks forward Julius Randle said. And you do that, I probably said it before, youve got to play perfect down the stretch. New York finally got something going in the third and cut it to 14, and finally got it to single digits when Morris four-point play made it 105-96 with 3:57 to play. RJ Barrett followed with a bucket, but that was as close as it got until the final basket. TIP-INS Spurs: G Dejounte Murray sat out to rest his right knee. ... Trey Lyles, who had fallen from the rotation and played just two minutes Friday in Philadelphia, came off the bench for 12 points in 15 minutes. ... San Antonio improved to 2-7 on the road. Knicks: Bobby Portis had 16 points, Randle added 14 and Barrett scored 13. ... Fizdale said second-round draft pick Ignas Brazdeikis will continue to spend time with the Knicks and their NBA G League affiliate. Brazdeikis had a 36-point game for Westchester this week. IT HASNT BEEN ALL BAD Before their struggles started, the Spurs got off to a good start. They won their first three, starting with an opening-night victory over the Knicks, and were 4-1. After we were 3-0 I thought that the trophy should have been given to us. Come on, its the Spurs, Popovich joked.","401160871"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Jimmy Butlers return to Philadelphia could be summed up in three letters: B-O-O. Josh Richardson scored 32 points and the 76ers led from start to finish in a 113-86 victory over Butler and the Miami Heat on Saturday night. Butler struggled to 11 points, missing nine of 13 field goal attempts. He sat out the entire fourth quarter. The star guard couldnt buy a basket -- and the notoriously tough Philly fans relished every moment. They booed him loudly during introductions and every time he touched the ball in the first half. They also cheered whenever he missed, and that was quite often. To tell you the truth, I legit didnt even pay attention, Butler said. I really dont pay attention to it. Joel Embiid added 23 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers (11-5), who won their fourth straight overall while improving to 7-0 at home. They played incredibly well, Butler said. Butler played 55 regular-season games for the Sixers last season, averaging 18.2 points after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last November. He helped Philadelphia beat Miami in the first round of the playoffs before the 76ers were eliminated in the second round by Toronto. He left Philadelphia in the offseason, inking a four-year, $142 million deal with the Heat in a sign-and-trade that brought Richardson to Philadelphia. Butler shot 2 of 8 in the first quarter, the Heat failed to connect on 17 of 22 tries and Philadelphia was up 28-13. The pattern continued as the 76ers took a 55-35 halftime lead thanks to Miamis 12-for-40 shooting in the first half, including 1 of 12 from behind the arc. Ben Simmons spent much of the night guarding Butler. When asked how he thought he fared, Philadelphias All-Star guard said, I think it went well, if you look at the boxscore. Philadelphias lead grew to 41 in the second half. Although Butler was embraced by the fan base during his stint in Philadelphia, everything wasnt rosy. He got heated during a film session last season with 76ers coach Brett Brown about the way he was being used in Browns offense, and there seems to be some lingering hard feelings. Brown was terse in his comments about Butler prior to Saturdays game. He had some great games for us, Brown said. We came close at the end. Sometimes things dont work out. Hes in a good place. Brown said he hasnt been in contact with Butler and answered a follow-up question about the Heat star by saying, I look forward to talking about the Miami Heat. Butler wasnt much more forthcoming about the parting. Thats something in the past, he said. Ill leave it there. Tyler Herro had 20 points to pace the Heat (11-4), who had won five in a row. RICHARDSONS RETURN Richardson, who played his first four seasons in Miami and averaged 16.6 points last season, made 11 of 15 shots and went 6 of 7 on 3-pointers. He had missed the previous two games with a hip injury. Definitely a fun game, Richardson said. ""I saw my first couple of shots go through and I just was staying aggressive."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami was playing the second game of a back-to-back after winning 116-108 at Chicago on Friday night.  Finished 6 for 24 from 3-point range. 76ers: It was the first of four matchups between the teams this season. Theyll next play Dec. 18 in Philadelphia.","401160872"
"CLEVELAND --  Riding a six-game losing streak, coming off a 42-point loss and playing without their leading scorer seemed to be a negative set of circumstances for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Those obstacles didn't matter Saturday night. Jordan Clarkson made all six of his 3-point attempts and scored 28 points to help Cleveland beat the Portland Trail Blazers 110-104. Clarkson's season high, which included 14 points in the fourth quarter, came a night after he was held scoreless in a 143-101 loss at Dallas. The Cavaliers completed a stretch of five games in seven days Saturday after the team arrived in Cleveland around 3 a.m. Larry Nance Jr. started in place of forward Kevin Love, who missed his second game this week because of a sore back. ""Obviously, last night wasn't necessarily a morale booster,"" said Nance, who had 11 points and 12 rebounds. ""To come back in and win this game, I'm really excited to see."" Cleveland coach John Beilein has remained upbeat despite his team's difficult stretch that dropped the Cavaliers' record to 5-11. ""I didn't see any fatigue,"" he said. ""I didn't see anything but effort to try and win the game. There are a lot of teams that have had tough schedules, that have had injuries and are rebuilding. We just have to stick together so we can be better than this."" Tristan Thompson scored 25 points and Cleveland held off a Trail Blazers' run in the fourth quarter. Damian Lillard returned after missing two games because of back spasms and scored 23 points, but Portland dropped to 5-12 and is 2-10 this month. The Trail Blazers have lost four straight and five of seven. Portland advanced to the Western Conference finals last season, but the Trail Blazers are struggling without center Jusuf Nurkic, who broke his leg in March and is still sidelined. ""I'm not a big worrier, but there is reason for concern on certain things,"" Lillard said. ""Because of the expectations for us, absolutely, it's disappointing."" Carmelo Anthony, playing his third game with Portland, scored 11 points in 35 minutes. Anthony was 5 of 15 from the field and missed all eight of his 3-point attempts. ""Physically I feel great,"" he said. ""Mentally I feel great. We've all been in situations like this before where we're trying to figure it out. There is still light at the end of the tunnel."" Cleveland led 100-88 midway through the fourth quarter, but Lillard scored the Blazers' next nine points, cutting the lead to 102-97. Baskets by Thompson and Nance halted Portland's rally. Lillard had 16 points in the fourth. CJ McCollum finished with 20 points. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: C Hassan Whiteside (sore right hip) missed his second straight game. Anthony Tolliver started in his place and scored nine points. ... Gary Trent Jr., who started Thursday, came off the bench with Lillard's return. ... G Rodney Hood, who played two seasons with the Cavaliers, including their 2018 NBA Finals team, scored 11 points. Cavaliers: Collin Sexton scored 19 points. ... Clarkson was 10 of 12 from the foul line. ... Cedi Osman had 12 rebounds. ...Thompson, a 61% free throw shooter, was 7 of 7 at the line. TOUGH GO Cleveland's tightly packed schedule, which also has three games next week, is one reason why Beilein is being cautious with Love, who also didn't play in New York on Sunday with the back issue. ""He could probably gut through it, but it's not advantageous for us or the team tonight or in the future if he tries to gut this through,"" Beilein said. GET TO THE POINT Portland coach Terry Stotts didn't go into a lot of detail when asked about his team's present state. ""Look at the record,"" he said. ""That kind of explains it."" Lillard's return should help and the four-time All-Star said his back wasn't an issue. ""I wasn't in pain,"" he said. ""I haven't played in two games, so I'm not going to come out and make every shot. I didn't play good enough to win.""","401160873"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers knew they would be tired playing their second game in as many nights. Experience made the difference against the young and rested Memphis Grizzlies. James scored on a driving layup with 1:30 left to put Los Angeles ahead to stay as the Lakers held off the Grizzlies 109-108 on Saturday night for their seventh straight victory. ""We just kept our composure,"" James said. ""That's what we do. We are a very resilient team."" The Grizzlies had a final chance with the ball and 1.3 seconds left. Jaren Jackson Jr. went sprawling trying to corral Kyle Anderson's inbounds pass. ""I was going to catch it and see if I had time to get a shot off or hit Ja (Morant), who would've probably been running full speed right next to me,"" Jackson said. ""Obviously, we didn't get to do all that."" James finished with 30 points. Anthony Davis added 22, Rajon Rondo had 14, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 12 and Dwight Howard had 10. Morant led Memphis with 26 points. Jae Crowder added 21, Jackson finished with 20, Dillon Brooks had 12 and Anderson scored 10, making rookie coach Taylor Jenkins very proud. ""If we can play like that every night, we have ourselves a chance,"" Jenkins said. The Lakers showed the effects of winning in Oklahoma City on Friday night. James made clear on social media he had trouble getting a nap with their hotel across the street from the FedExForum, where No. 16 Memphis beat Mississippi 87-86 earlier Saturday. ""We're lucky to get out of here with a win. Credit to the Grizzlies for coming out strong,"" said Lakers coach Frank Vogel, who used earplugs to help him rest. ""There young guys really came after us, in the first quarter in particular. Morant and Jackson are special talents and they put us in a hole."" LA never led in the first half and trailed by as much as 15 in the second quarter. The Lakers got going in the third and opened the fourth by jumping out to their biggest lead at 94-87. The Grizzlies led 105-100 on a tip-in by Brandon Clarke with 3:24 to go. The Lakers scored the next nine with James hitting his layup for the go-ahead bucket, and Davis followed by tipping in James' miss for a 109-105 lead with 53.5 seconds left. Morant's layup with 28 seconds left pulled Memphis within a point. James missed a jumper with the Grizzlies grabbing the rebound to set up the final try. The Grizzlies lost their third straight on a night they wore their Vancouver teal uniforms for the first time to celebrate their 25th NBA season along with a throwback court. Memphis led 35-25 after the first quarter and 63-55 at halftime. TIP-INS Lakers: Rondo played hours after the NBA fined him $35,000 for the foul that got him ejected from the Lakers' win over the Thunder for kicking guard Dennis Schroder in the groin area. Against Memphis, Rondo also had six assists and three rebounds. ... James snapped his seven-game streak with 10 or more assists, the longest in his career, with just four assists. It was the longest such streak for the Lakers since Magic Johnson had 10 straight in 1990-91. Grizzlies: They hit their first eight 3-pointers before Jackson missed with 10:38 left in the second. The team finished 14 of 30, the eighth time in nine games it has hit at least 10 3s. ... Outscored the Lakers 52-46 in the paint and outrebounded them 47-40. ... Memphis now is 4-1 in games decided by six or fewer points this season. MOVING ON UP James had six rebounds and now has 9,002 for his career. He also had two more steals, giving him 1,958 to move past Derek Harper for 14th all-time. He explained why he's been so successful taking the ball away. ""Anticipation, being in the right place at the right time, being healthy for the majority of my career so far, and then also being around some really good defensive coaches,"" James said. NO FOUL TRIPPING Davis set a Lakers franchise record by making 26 free throws on 27 attempts when these teams first met Oct. 29. Jackson recalled barely playing in that game because of foul trouble. This time, the No. 4 overall pick of the 2018 draft played 33 minutes, having picked up only two fouls. Davis was 5 of 6 at the line this time.","401160874"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo continued to provide the offense, and the Bucks defense eventually caught up. Antetokounmpo had 28 points and 10 rebounds for his 16th consecutive double-double to lead Milwaukee past the Detroit Pistons 104-90 on Saturday night for its seventh straight victory. ""There were different guys stepping up, making plays, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. I think the defense held them tonight. Theyre a little banged up on a back-to-back. Unfortunate for them, but kind to us. Wesley Mathews added 13 points and Eric Bledsoe had 11 for the Bucks, who improved their record to an Eastern Conference-best 13-3. Derrick Rose scored 20 points, Langston Galloway added 13 and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 17 rebounds for Detroit, which was without Blake Griffin. The star forward, who has played in just four games this season, was inactive for injury recovery after playing 32 minutes in a 128-103 victory over Atlanta on Friday in the first game of the back-to-back. It doesnt change my approach. Coming into the game, my mindset is to win, Antetokounmpo said. Obviously, when you dont have a guy like Blake thats a really great player, and (has) a lot of experience playing, now youve got to figure out who youre guarding and whose going to go against you. Antetokounmpo is the first player to open the season with 16 double-doubles in a row since Moses Malone did it for the Houston Rockets in 1981. Antetokounmpo and George Hill hit consecutive 3-pointers to fuel a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter and put Milwaukee in front 89-69. Detroit missed its first eight shots of the period before Langston Galloway finally hit a 3 with 5:47 remaining. We had some ill-advised shots and didn't execute the way we should have, Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. In those moments youve got to have a clear understanding of what you are trying to do. We didn't do that. The Bucks used a 15-2 run midway through the third quarter to build a 71-54 lead. Detroit whittled it to 77-69 entering the final period. Casey said he thought fatigue played a factor, especially down the stretch. The Pistons shot 60% in the victory over Atlanta, but dipped to 41% against the Bucks. Shooting is the first part you saw, Casey said. The same shots we were getting last night were all short. That is a back-to-back, but that is the whole NBA. Hills 3-pointer at the buzzer put the Bucks up 54-47 at halftime. Milwaukee shot 51% in the first half, making 21 of 41 shots, but Detroit stayed close thanks to nine second-chance points. A lot of this is such a two-way sport; offense takes care of the defense, defense takes care of the offense, said Bucks guard Wesley Matthews. We start taking care of the ball a little bit better, we had a lot of turnovers on our end, three I think, at least three myself, and it kind of puts the defense in a tough spot. But we responded, we compete and were always going to compete. TIP-INS Detroit has four players who were with the Bucks last season: Tim Frazier, Thon Maker, Tony Snell and Christian Wood. As I went through their depth chart I was like, wow, dont remember having four from a previous team, previous season and then playing them, Budenholzer said.","401160875"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Even without Rudy Gobert, the usually defensive-minded Utah Jazz blitzed the New Orleans Pelicans with some high-octane offense. Mitchell made six 3-pointers and scored a season-high 37 points as Utah outlasted the Pelicans 128-120 on Saturday night. Mitchell sparked the Jazz to a quick start after they held off the depleted Golden State Warriors the night before. ""We needed to come out with a hot start, as you get a little fatigued in the second half of a back-to-back,"" said Mitchell, who had 14 points in the first five minutes as Utah (11-5) jumped out to a 28-9 lead. Bojan Bogdanovic added 28 points to help the Jazz overcome the absence of Gobert, who was a late scratch with a sprained ankle. ""This was our best game offensively. Every player was playing with high confidence. We started the game so well,"" Bogdanovic said. Mitchell knew the Jazz needed to score as much as they could while they had their legs. ""They shot the ball well. We weren't into them at all, they didn't feel us defensively,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry lamented. Though the Jazz led the entire way, they had to quell a late comeback from the Pelicans, who had won three in a row and scored 66 points in the second half. Brandon Ingram had 33 points and Jrue Holiday scored 12 of his 28 in the fourth quarter. JJ Redick added 20 points for New Orleans (6-10). ""The second half, we picked up the energy, got into the ball and made it hard for them to either get to the basket or pass off for 3s. We did what we were supposed to do, what we wanted to do from the beginning of the game,"" Holiday said. Mike Conley, who has been decidedly inconsistent during his first season in Utah, threw an alley-oop to Jeff Green and then hit a 3-pointer to boost Utah to a 122-110 lead with 2:15 left. Conley was 1 for 8 to that point but looked off Mitchell and calmly hit the shot. ""They were big plays and I needed to get my legs under me after chasing JJ Redick around. But the fourth quarter is winning time and both those plays were big for us and came comfortable for me,"" Conley said. The Pelicans made one more run as Ingram hit a 3 with 37.9 seconds remaining to make it 124-120. But then Bogdanovic and Green each made two free throws to clinch it. Green had 15 points and Tony Bradley added 14 points and nine rebounds as they shared the center position in Gobert's absence. Lonzo Ball hit a 3 to cap a 15-5 run and bring the Pelicans to 86-78 with 4:36 left in the third quarter. The Jazz then built back a double-digit lead a couple of times until Ingram made a 3-pointer with 4:16 remaining to cut Utah's advantage to 113-106. Ball was on a minutes restriction in his second game back from a groin injury but had 13 points on 5-for-15 shooting in 25 minutes. Gobert played most of Friday's win over Golden State after he turned his ankle in the first quarter. He had seven blocks in that game but sat out against the Pelicans after pregame warmups determined he was too sore. Bolstered by two quick 3s by Bogdanovic and Mitchell, the Jazz scored the first 14 points of the game. ""It wasn't anything premediatated, it was just me starting to feel it and then to just keep going,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell had 23 points and Bogdanovic poured in 20 in the first half as the Jazz led 74-54 at the break. Utah posted season bests for points in a half and a game. BRADLEY COMES UP BIG Bradley's 14 points and nine rebounds were both just one off his career highs and his teammates relished his time in the spotlight. Gobert joined reporters in asking him questions in the locker room, and others shouted his praises as he was interviewed. ""All I was thinking was to play hard, rebound and defend as best I can,"" Bradley said. His hustle turned into opportunities as he ran the floor and found himself with the ball at the rim on multiple plays. He even made a Gobert-esque block that brought a loud ovation in the fourth quarter. Before the game, Green told the young center to play hard and not overthink it or replay mistakes. ""He did that, and much more,"" Green said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Derrick Favors, who played in Utah for eight seasons, didn't make the trip because of back spasms. . The Pelicans made all 17 of their free throws until Redick missed one with 1:59 to play. They finished 19 for 20. . For the first time this season, Redick was the team's leading rebounder with seven. Jazz: Mitchell got a technical for staring down Nicolo Melli after dunking over him in the second quarter. ... A coach's challenge was successful in the fourth quarter when Ingram kicked out his leg on a 3-pointer and struck Joe Ingles, who originally was whistled for a foul. . The Jazz shot 51% from the field and 42% from 3-point range while outrebounding the Pelicans 49-38.","401160876"
"When asked about the Mavericks' improved defense, Luka Doncic makes a playful joke about Dirk Nowitzki's defense. (0:25) HOUSTON --  Dallas coach Rick Carlisle didnt want his team to get overexcited about its convincing victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday. He was, however, quick to note the importance of the victory. This is a big win. There's no question about that, Carlisle said. You come in here, this is a big-time place to play and you're playing against great players. So our guys deserve credit but this is a process and its day by day and week by week and we've got to continue to go for daily improvement. Luka Doncic scored 41 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added a season-high 31 and the Mavericks never trailed in the 137-123 romp. The Mavericks scored 45 points in the first quarter and were up 78-60 at halftime. Hardaway had 19 in the half, Doncic 17 and Kristaps Porzingis 15. That first quarter killed us, Houstons P.J. Tucker said. James Harden was asked what Houston did wrong defensively. Everything, he said. We allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do from the beginning of the game and when you give a team like that comfort ... they gain confidence. And that's what they did. The Mavericks has won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row. Dallas knew that the Rockets had a quick turnaround after playing a game in Los Angeles on Friday night and focused on getting off to a good start. It was important, Hardaway said. We wanted to make sure we came out of the gate with some firepower, some energy. The Mavericks got a dunk from Dwight Powell to push the lead to 11 early in the fourth quarter. Houston used a 6-0 run after that shot to get to 110-105 with 9 minutes to go. Doncic ended the run with a jump shot, but Russell Westbrook added a basket seconds later to cut it to five again. Dallas was still up by 5 later in the quarter before scoring the next five points, with a dunk from Hardaway, to make it 119-109 midway through period, and Houston didn't get close again. James Harden had 32 points for Houston but was just 2 of 15 on 3-pointers in a game where the Rockets made 10 of 44 3-point attempts. The Mavericks had extended the lead to 16 later in the fourth when Doncic scored six points in a row, capped by a 3-pointer to make it 132-113 with about 3 1/2 minutes to go. Dallas led by 20 in the third quarter before Houston scored the next seven points, with a 3-pointer from Tucker, to get to 89-76 midway through the period. The Mavericks were up by 16 later in the third after two free throws by Dorian Finney-Smith before Tucker made consecutive baskets to cut the lead to 103-91. Harden added two free throws, but Hardaway made a jump shot seconds later to make it 105-93. Westbrook made a basket to wrap up the third quarter and cut the lead to 10 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Mavericks: Seth Curry was back after sitting out the last game because of an illness. ... Porzingis finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds. ... Doncic had 10 assists and six rebounds. ... Doncic and Hardaway made five 3-pointers each. Rockets: House returned after missing the last game with a sore left shoulder. ... Clint Capela had 21 points and 22 rebounds. ... Westbrook scored 27 points with six assists and five rebounds. HARDAWAYS HEALTH Hardaway has been an important player for the Mavericks this season after undergoing surgery on his left leg because of a stress fracture in April. My leg feels amazing, Hardaway said. I'm getting back to my old self and just trying to make the most out of the opportunity right now. Sunday was his third straight game with at least 16 points after he had just one such performance in his first 13 games this season. THEY SAID IT Houston coach Mike DAntoni on the teams start Sunday: They punched us good and we fall all the way back. A lot of time when you do that, you run out of gas.","401160877"
"NEW YORK -- Kyrie Irving will miss at least two more games, sitting out trips to his old homes in Cleveland and Boston. The way Spencer Dinwiddie is playing, it might not matter to the Brooklyn Nets. ""Just, difference-maker right now,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Dinwiddie scored 30 points in another strong start in place of the injured point guard and the Nets beat the New York Knicks 103-101 on Sunday for their season-high third straight victory. Irving continues to rest an injured right shoulder, and Dinwiddie is making sure the Nets get by without him, scoring 20 or more points in a career-best five straight games after stepping into the starting lineup. He was 13 of 14 from the foul line, where the Nets had a whopping 27-9 advantage in makes. Jarrett Allen had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, and Taurean Prince had 14 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists. Joe Harris scored 13 points, with four coming after the Knicks had cut it to one with 1:20 left. Marcus Morris scored 26 points for the Knicks, who lost their third straight. They played without rookie RJ Barrett. He was scratched after feeling sick before the game. The Nets are missing their starting backcourt, with Caris LeVert out after right thumb surgery. But they have won four of five to even their record at 8-8. ""We don't have some of our better players on the court, but we're still finding a way to win,"" Allen said. The biggest reason has been the play of Dinwiddie, who could go back to the bench as soon as Friday if Irving is cleared to return. Or, perhaps Atkinson could choose to start them together until LeVert is recovered. ""I'm not the coach, I don't make those decisions,"" Dinwiddie said. ""If that's the new role, then that's what I'll do, and if it's not, then it's not."" The Nets opened a 29-15 lead but struggled when Dinwiddie and Allen went to the bench and let the Knicks close the gap to 52-46 by halftime. New York cut it to one after back-to-back 3s by Morris and another by Wayne Ellington, but Harris scored on a drive and later added a pair of free throws. The Knicks had a much stronger effort than a night earlier, when they never led in a home loss to San Antonio. But they fell to 4-13 ahead of a tough five-game stretch against Toronto, Philadelphia, Boston, Milwaukee and Denver. ""I embrace the challenge,"" coach David Fizdale said. ""I don't feel like we need to be looking at that like that's impossible. We're going to take it a game at a time and continue to try to give ourselves a chance to win every night."" TIP-INS Nets: Atkinson said Irving wouldn't travel with the team to Cleveland on Monday but wasn't sure yet about Wednesday to Boston. ... It was the most points Dinwiddie has scored in 12 games against the Knicks. Knicks: Mitchell Robinson was called for a sixth foul with 4:54 left, but Fizdale challenged the call and it was overturned, allowing Robinson to stay on the floor. Not for long: He then picked up the sixth 42 seconds later and was given a technical foul after saying something to a referee on his way off the floor. ... Morris has scored 20 or more in four straight and six of his past seven games. KNOX'S CHANCE Kevin Knox II had five points starting in place of Barrett. He not only hadn't started this season, but his minutes off the bench had been dwindling. He had been limited to 10 or fewer in the past two games, with Fizdale seeking a more consistent defensive effort from the 2018 lottery pick. So he was hoping to make the most of his opportunity Sunday but picked up his fourth foul less than four minutes into the second half. ""Like I say you've got to be ready when your name gets called,"" Knox said. ""My dad used to always tell me growing up: You're an ankle sprain away from that time."" MORE NOISE The sound around the Nets has changed -- on and off the court -- since the recent signing of Iman Shumpert, who began his career with the Knicks, won a title with Cleveland and has done some rap music. ""I just see Theo [Pinson], DeAndre [Jordan], the communication is better because he talks a ton and his aggressiveness, he's pushing the other guys,"" Atkinson said. ""And then our music has definitely improved in the locker room. We've taken a step up in our music selection. Obviously, he's pretty sophisticated there.""","401160878"
"WASHINGTON --  Sacramento Kings coach Luke Walton hoped to avoid a track meet against the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. Defense made it happen in the second half. Harrison Barnes matched his season high with 26 points on 7-of-8 shooting, Bojan Bogdanovic had 21 points to help the Kings to a 113-106 victory. Sacramento held Washington -- the NBAs second-ranked offense -- to 49 points after the break and 21 in the fourth quarter. The challenge to the group at halftime was lets see if we cant continue to score but actually get some stops, said Walton, whose team entered halftime tied at 57. Lets try to put our will on this game. I think our guys did a really nice job in the second half of playing defense. Buddy Hield added 18 points, including a late 3-pointer that put Sacramentos lead at multiple possessions for good, and Richaun Holmes had 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Kings -- who are without injured regulars Marvin Bagley III (thumb) and DAaron Fox (ankle) -- won for the seventh time in 10 games to improve to 7-8 while forcing 17 turnovers and holding the Wizards to 46% shooting. We just wanted to come out and guard and be there for each other, Holmes said, and I think we did a pretty good job tonight. Bradley Beal led Washington with 20 points, ending his string of 30 or more at a career-best five games. Isaiah Thomas added 17, and Moritz Wagner had 12 points and 11 rebounds. The ball just didnt go in, Beal said about Washingtons offense, which is averaging a fraction above 119 points and 48% from the floor. It was just one of those nights for us. On nights like tonight, weve got to defend, and thats kind of been our Achilles' heel. Tied at the half, the Kings built their lead to nine on a 17-8 third-quarter run. Bogdanovic scored eight points in the stretch, including an early 3-pointer, a driving reverse layup and then a free throw that stretched it to 88-79 with 1:41 left in the quarter. The Kings kept the lead at multiple baskets until Thomas baseline 3-pointer cut it to 100-97 with 4:11 left. Hield immediately answered with a 3-pointer. The Wizards thought they had cut it to two points inside of 2 minutes, only to learn that Thomas Bryants apparent putback shortly after Hields 3 had been overruled for a shot clock violation following video review. We are getting better at our rotations and we are getting better on the ball, said Cory Joseph, who guarded Beal most of the evening. We are getting better as a whole defensively, and I think that we just have to continue to climb because we have the personnel to do that. TIP INS: Kings: Went 2 of 13 from 3-point range in the first half and finished 11 of 31  G Cory Joseph (heel) started despite being limited to 23 minutes in Fridays loss at Brooklyn ... Bogdanovic (hamstring tightness) was a game-time decision after missing Friday. Wizards: Beals 30-point streak was the fourth-longest in franchise history. With another game, he wouldve tied Bernard King, who scored 30-plus in six straight from Nov. 3 to Nov. 16 of 1990. ... Wagners double-double was the second of his career. The second-year pros first came on Nov. 15 in a 137-116 win at Minnesota. WHO WON THE PAINT? While the Wizards outscored the Kings 52-46 inside the paint, Sacramento shot considerably better there (23 of 34) and also earned 28 free throws, 16 more than Washington. QUOTABLE Were not the most talented team, so we have to do everything the other teams dont do at a high level. Weve got to defend. Weve got to get the 50-50 balls. Weve got to make shots. We have no room for error, really, if we want to be good and we want to win games. -- Thomas, who is 14 games into his first season with the Wizards.","401160879"
"DENVER --  Will Barton wasn't happy with his energy in the first half, so he pledged to pick it up in the third quarter. He delivered on his promise and led the Denver Nuggets to their fifth straight victory. Barton scored 12 of his 22 points in a momentum-turning third quarter, Paul Millsap finished with 23 points in Denver's 116-104 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. Jamal Murray had 22 points, and Nikola Jokic had just eight points, but grabbed 13 rebounds to help the Nuggets win their ninth in the last 10 games. It took a shutdown second half against a tired team, led by Barton's energy. ""I felt like in the first half my energy wasn't there and I wasn't flying around on defense good enough so I told them I'm going to bring it the third quarter,"" Barton said. Denver held Phoenix guard Devin Booker to a season-low 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Booker came in averaging 26.2 points in November but showed fatigue in the Suns' fifth game in seven days. ""I'm glad we got it out of the way,"" Booker said. ""Two back-to-backs in one week, I haven't heard of that before, but it's what the schedule presented to us."" Cheick Diallo led Phoenix with a career-high 22 points and Dario Saric had a career-high 17 rebounds to go with 18 points. Booker had just seven points into the fourth quarter, but the Suns led most of the game until the Nuggets rallied. Phoenix was again without center Aron Baynes and guard Ricky Rubio, and the lack of depth showed in the third when the team combined for 7-of-22 shooting. Booker missed all four of his attempts. ""Just missing shots,"" Booker said. ""I'm sure I'll be fine and I know getting Ricky and Aron back will help out to that."" Denver used a 10-2 run late in the third quarter to take its first lead since the first quarter. Barton had 12 points in the period and Millsap seven before picking up his fourth foul. ""He was getting offensive rebounds, putbacks, he was locking up,"" center Mason Plumleaid of Barton. ""He changed the game and he told us he was going to."" The Nuggets led 88-87 early in the fourth, then used a 13-4 run to take a 101-91 lead. Malik Beasley, who had been out of the rotation, hit a 3-pointer with 5:11 remaining to make it 104-93. Booker hit his only 3-pointer of the night to pull Phoenix within eight, but Denver went on a 9-2 run to put it out of reach. TIP-INS Suns: Rubio has missed three of the last four games with back spasms and played only 16 minutes in the other game. ... Baynes has missed four straight games with a right hip flexor strain. ... Elie Okobo scored a season-high 14 points. He had 11 in the first half. Nuggets: Plumlee shook off a headache earlier in the day to score 14 points and Monte Morris added 10 off the bench. ... C Bol Bol was recalled from Windy City of the G League. Bol, the team's first-round pick out of Oregon in June, played four games for the Bulls, averaging 11.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 blocks in 16.9 minutes per game. SHORT-TIMER Suns coach Monty Williams played 456 games over 10 NBA seasons, including a short stint with Denver. The Nuggets signed Williams to a free-agent contract on Jan. 23, 1999, and he got into one game for six minutes before being cut 20 days after signing with Denver. ""I wasn't here long enough to have a memory,"" Williams said Sunday. ""It wasn't anything worth talking about. I messed my ankle up real bad and tore a couple of ligaments and played on it. Should have been in today's environment; they would have let me sit out the whole year."" Williams is in the stats book with the Nuggets. He hit one free throw and missed both of his shot attempts.","401160880"
"LOS ANGELES --  Doc Rivers has seen the Los Angeles Clippers roster undergo many changes over the past 15 months. Montrezl Harrell has remained one of the few constants. Harrell showed again on Sunday night that he shouldn't be overlooked despite the additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The fifth-year forward tied a career high with 34 points as the Clippers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 134-109 for their fifth straight win. `They are starting to see Montrez is good. He can score a lot of different ways and it seems like each year he is adding more to his game,"" Rivers said. ""He went left a couple times tonight when the scouting report is to not have him go right."" It is the fifth 30-point game of Harrell's career and the second time he has scored 34 this season (the other was Nov. 6 against Milwaukee). He was 13 of 18 from the field and grabbed 12 rebounds as he led the Clippers in scoring for the fourth time this season. Leonard scored 24 points, Lou Williams added 19 and Paul George had 18 for the Clippers, who have won 11 of 12 at home. ""It is great that we can still be able to run and collect wins while we are still adjusting,"" Harrell said. ""We're a deep team and anyone can have a big night."" Brandon Ingram, one of three Lakers players involved in the Anthony Davis trade, led New Orleans with 24 points and eight rebounds in his first game back at Staples Center. Jrue Holiday scored 18 and E'Twaun Moore had 17. ""There have been a couple times where we've been down and try to fight back and it has been a little too hard with the deficits. I feel like that has been the standard so far,"" Holliday said. JJ Redick and Holiday hit 3-pointers to give the Pelicans a 10-6 lead three minutes into the game before the Clippers took control with a 15-4 run. George keyed the run with a pair of 3s and Leonard added five. Los Angeles led 40-27 and then increased it to 62-37 on George's 3 with 5:55 remaining in the first half. ""The slow starts are killing us. You can't give up 40 in a quarter unless you are going to score 45, and we weren't going to score 45 against that team,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. The Clippers went into halftime with a 72-56 advantage before New Orleans cut the lead in half with an 11-3 run to start the third quarter. Jaxson Hayes' layup drew the Pelicans to 86-80 with 4:53 remaining in the quarter but that would be as close as they got as Los Angeles countered with an 11-2 run, which included Harrell scoring the last six points. ""They cut it to six and we got it right back up. I thought our guys got back to playing,"" Rivers said. LONG DISTANCE CLIPS In the three games that Leonard and George have played together, the Clippers are averaging 15.3 3-pointers per game, which is five more than the first 14 games. Los Angeles had 16 3-pointers on Sunday with eight players hitting from beyond the arc. George led the way with six 3s. ""Everyone is trapping on us but we are moving the ball and getting great looks. They're wide open, so we better take them,"" Rivers said.

"CLEVELAND --  Spencer Dinwiddie keeps coming through in the clutch for the Brooklyn Nets. Dinwiddie's fadeaway jumper with 1.9 seconds remaining gave Brooklyn its fourth straight victory, 108-106 over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. Dinwiddie scored 23 points on the day he was voted Eastern Conference player of the week. The Nets are 5-1 without leading scorer Kyrie Irving, who missed his sixth straight game with a sore shoulder. Dinwiddie is averaging 24.6 points in Irving's absence. ""Spencer Dinwiddie just put on a clinic on how to keep your team under control and make the right play,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. Following a shot clock violation and the score tied 106-all, the Nets called timeout with 6.2 seconds left. Dinwiddie, after taking the inbounds pass from Joe Harris, dribbled around Cedi Osman to the right of the key and hit the tiebreaking shot from 18 feet. Dinwiddie improvised after taking the pass and was hoping center Jarrett Allen would bail him out if he missed. ""I was trying to get a shot up in the first three seconds, so Jarrett had a chance to tip it in,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Cedi was kind of sliding right, so I took a couple dribbles and put it up."" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson gave Dinwiddie credit for the result. ""It was not a great play (drawn up), but a great individual play by Spencer,"" he said. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love was out for the second straight game because of a sore back. Jarrett Allen had 22 points and a season-high 21 rebounds, going 9 of 10 from the field and adding a key block when he swatted Jordan Clarkson's shot out of bounds with eight seconds left and the game tied. ""I should have kept in inbounds, but I got a little excited,"" Allen said. ""I knew I had to be a little bit careful and not foul."" Cleveland erased a 106-97 deficit with just over 2 minutes left and cut the lead to one on Clarkson's 3-pointer. Collin Sexton tied the game with a free throw, but missed the second shot with 21 seconds to play. ""It felt good,"" Sexton said. ""It went in and out. I've just got to make it the next time. I know I should have made it."" Cleveland maintained possession, but Allen blocked Clarkson's shot and the Cavaliers followed with their shot clock violation. Clarkson scored 23 points while Larry Nance Jr. had 20 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland, which has lost seven of eight. Brooklyn didn't shoot a free throw in the first half but was 9 of 11 at the line in the third quarter. The Nets didn't get to the line in the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Allen made two free throws with 8:19 remaining in the third quarter. ... G Iman Shumpert, signed by Brooklyn two weeks ago, was also a member of the Cavaliers' championship team. He hit a 3-pointer and played 18 minutes. Cavaliers: Love, who was sidelined Saturday, had been listed as questionable and the team announced he wasn't playing after he went through pregame warmups. ... Nance started in Love's place for the second straight game. NOT IN TOWN Irving, a star on the Cavaliers' championship team in 2016, has played in Cleveland one time since being traded to Boston prior to the 2017-18 season, coming in that season's opener. He missed both of the Celtics' appearances last season. Irving will also miss Wednesday's game in Boston, the Nets' first trip there this season. He was injured in a 119-114 loss at Utah on Nov. 12 and played through the injury two nights later in Denver. DOMINATING IN THE MIDDLE Allen recorded the second 20-point/20-rebound game of his career. ""Jarrett Allen is playing fantastic,"" Atkinson said. ""He's one of the best rim protectors in the league and came up with another big play.""","401160882"
"DETROIT --  Dwane Casey had an easy time identifying when and how his team won this game. ""I think our defense was exceptional in the second half,"" the Detroit coach said. Casey shouldn't get much argument from the Orlando Magic about that. They were held to 15 points in the third quarter and 33 in the second half of Detroit's 103-88 win Monday night. Luke Kennard scored 20 points and Blake Griffin added 17 to lead the Pistons past the short-handed Magic. Orlando was playing a second straight game without Nikola Vucevic, out with a right ankle sprain. The Magic are now 0-7 on the road this season. ""They're good defensively and they were aggressive with their coverages,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""I thought in the first half we did a good job; the second half we just got away from it. ... The ball has got to move."" Detroit went on an 11-0 run near the end of the third and led 78-70 at the start of the fourth. Orlando never really threatened after that. The Magic shot just 39% from the field and 8 of 25 from 3-point range. The Pistons entered the day shooting 39.2% from beyond the arc, the second-best mark in the NBA. They were a bit below that clip Monday, going 14 of 38, but Langston Galloway and Svi Mykhailiuk made four 3-pointers each, and Kennard added three. ""When people play basketball and people play games, they get more adjusted to the game,"" Mykhailiuk said. ""When coach trusts you, it relaxes you and gives you more freedom on the court."" Terrence Ross led Orlando with 19 points and Evan Fournier added 17. Andre Drummond had seven points and 18 rebounds for Detroit. The Magic led by 11 early in the second quarter, but Detroit quickly erased that deficit, and Orlando led 55-53 at halftime. ""If we play the right way and lose it's one thing, but that's not what we did,"" Clifford said. ""In this league, you pay the price."" OVERTURNED Detroit won a coach's challenge in the fourth quarter when a foul on Mykhailiuk was changed to an offensive foul on Markelle Fultz. Casey said he thinks the spirit of the replay system is good, although there might be room for some tweaks. ""It's tough,"" Casey said. ""When you only have one, and it takes a timeout, and there's so many plays you want to use it on."" INJURIES The Pistons were without point guard Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction), as well as Tony Snell (left hip strain). In addition to Vucevic, Orlando was missing forward Aaron Gordon (right ankle contusion) and guard Michael Carter-Williams (left hip irritation).

TIP-INS Magic: Isaac had 10 points, six rebounds and four blocks. ... Orlando shot 5 of 21 from the field in the third quarter and 6 of 18 in the fourth. Pistons: Mykhailiuk equaled a career high with 12 points. ... Galloway scored 12 points of his own for his 13th straight game in double figures.","401160883"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  T.J. Warren's aggressive approach led the Indiana Pacers to their biggest offensive night of the season. Warren scored 26 points on 11-of-15 shooting, and the Pacers beat the Memphis Grizzlies 126-114 on Monday night. ""I just want to stay aggressive when I'm out there,"" Warren said. ""We have a lot of potential. We're clicking right now, so we just have to keep it up and get ready for the next one."" Jeremy Lamb had 19 points and Aaron Holiday added 16 points off the bench for the Pacers (10-6), who have won three straight and seven of nine games. Indiana's 126 points were a season-best. The Pacers shot 54.3% from the field and 54.5% on 3-pointers. Their 18 3s were also a season high and one shy of the franchise record. ""I thought we did a good job of executing, getting out and pushing the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We had 29 assists, so we had good ball movement. But we were trading baskets. We gave up 62 points in the paint and that's way too many points."" Jared Jackson Jr. scored a season-high 28 points -- including a career-high six 3-pointers -- Ja Morant had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke scored 17 points on 8-of-9 shooting for the Grizzlies (5-11), who have lost four straight. ""The biggest takeaway is that we didn't come in with an urgency to start the game,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We started selling the game a little bit, but a little too late for us when we started settling in."" The Pacers led by as much as 29 after T.J. McConnell scored and Holiday made back-to-back 3-pointers, including one to give Indiana a 112-83 lead with 10:45 remaining. Jackson hit two 3s, Morant twice made layups and Solomon Hill scored in a 12-0 spurt in the fourth quarter by the Grizzlies, but Memphis couldn't put enough together to overcome such a big deficit. The Pacers took a 16-point lead in the first half after a 12-2 run that ended with a free throw by Domantas Sabonis that made it 65-49 with 2:02 to play in the second quarter. Morant made a layup and Jae Crowder a 3-pointer to close out the half. The Pacers led 67-56 at halftime. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Clarke was 5 for 5 from the field with 11 points in the first quarter. . C Jonas Valanciunas finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. . Memphis shot 47.4% from the field, including 13 of 29 on 3-pointers. Pacers: G Malcolm Brogdon had 14 points, six rebounds and eight assists. . Sabonis had 13 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. . F JaKarr Sampson was inactive for a second straight game with a sore back. STARTING FIVE A number of injuries have left the Pacers short-handed many times this season, forcing McMillan to use seven different lineups so far. Against the Grizzlies, Indiana used its opening night starting five for just the third time and is now 2-1 using that combination. BIG BLOCKING Myles Turner, who finished with seven points and four rebounds, blocked a season-high five shots -- the most by a Pacers player in a single game this season.","401160884"
"ATLANTA --  Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders moved Jeff Teague out of the starting lineup to give the reserves more scoring punch. The Timberwolves reserves responded, scoring 46 points in a 125-113 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. The idea to move Teague to the bench wasn't that of Saunders alone. He said he and the former Hawks guard have been talking about it for some time. ""We talked earlier. It's more about who ends games, too,"" Saunders said. ""Jeff Teague is a professional and he's a man. It came about with him and I having a casual conversation. He said, `I'm good with whatever role you want me in.' He saw and agreed that there was a need in that second unit."" Teague had eight points and eight assists. Reserves Keita Bates-Diop and Gorgui Dieng each scored 13. ""Gorgui was amazing. ... When he's given the opportunity, he goes out and makes magic happen,"" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who scored 28 points and had 13 rebounds for Minnesota. ""Jeff (Teague) is just a pro. He's an amazing guy to have in the locker room. We're in this to win. We're not about individual accolades."" Andrew Wiggins added 25 points and the Minnesota Timberwolves rode three big offensive quarters. Trae Young scored 37 points for the Hawks, who outscored the Timberwolves 34-16 in the second quarter. But Minnesota had 38 points in the first quarter, 39 in the third and 32 in the fourth against one of the NBA's weakest defensive teams and snapped a two-game skid. Jabari Parker pitched in 22 points for the Hawks and rookie center Bruno Fernando scored a career-high 13. The Timberwolves shot 63.6% in the first quarter and opened a 40-30 lead early in the second, but missed 15-of-19 shots over the rest of the period. Young scored 14 points in the quarter while Hawks attacked the basket frequently and had 21 points and seven assists -- several on alley-oop lob passes -- by halftime, leading Atlanta to a 64-54 lead. Towns heated up after halftime to pull the Timberwolves back into the game. In the third quarter alone, he had 15 points, eight rebounds and three assists to help Minnesota take a 93-90 lead to the fourth quarter. Other than in that second quarter, the youngish Atlanta squad frequently busted defensive assignments, such as when they were double-teaming Anthony in the third quarter. ""We had a lot of undisciplined play,"" said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce. ""We were leaving strong-side shooters (open), we were double-teaming in the post when we weren't in that coverage. It was the lack of discipline on a lot of our defensive possessions that got us in trouble . . . ""Blitzing KAT in the second half wasn't the plan and because there were some cross matches, guys just overacted to the situation and we got caught with him hitting the cutter a couple times . . . At this stage, every game has a different personality."" TIP-INS TIMBERWOLVES: Rookie Jarrett Culver started at guard rather than former Hawk Jeff Teague. They played together at times. ... Frequent starter Noah Vonleh did play, and was not listed on the pregame injury report. ... Guard Shabazz Napier (hamstring) and forward Jake Layman (toe sprain) remain sidelined. HAWKS: Guard Cam Reddish returned after missing two games with a sprained left wrist and started to bump DeAndre' Bembry back to the bench. They've been tag-teaming in place of Kevin Huerter, who remains sidelined with a sprained rotator cuff in his left shoulder. The rookie from Duke continues to struggle to find his shot. Reddish scored seven points on 2-of-10 shooting, one of them a fast-break alley-oop dunk off a pass from Young. ... Parker has scored at least 10 points in 16-of-17 games.

"BOSTON --  Marcus Smart had the ball bounce right for him and the Boston Celtics this time. Jaylen Brown scored 24 points, Jayson Tatum had 20 and the Celtics held off the Sacramento Kings 103-102 despite a career-high 41 points from Buddy Hield on Monday night. Smart had 17 points, including two key baskets, and seven assists. Enes Kanter added 13 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who had lost the final two games of a 2/3 trip to the West. Smart sandwiched his baskets around a 3-pointer by Bogdan Bogdanovic, the second a spinning shot with 31 seconds to go that pushed the Celtics ahead 103-102. The first bounced off the front of the rim and fell in -- a similar look to one that went the other way as time expired when the teams met in Sacramento. ""Yeah, it was a good feeling,"" he said, smiling, of the friendly roll. ""When I shot it, I saw it on the front of the rim again and I was like: `Not again. I've got to get it this time.' It felt good to see the ball finally go in. It's just ironic it happened to bounce like that again this time."" In the team's first meeting on Nov. 17 -- a 100-99 Kings victory that snapped Boston's 10-game winning streak -- Smart drove and had his shot roll off the front as time expired. Harrison Barnes added 20 points for the Kings, who had won seven of 10. Hield was 15 of 26 from the floor and went 11 for 21 on 3-point attempts. ""They're (defenders) locked into Buddy, and to win in this league it takes a team. So we're going to keep looking for him, but we need everyone to step up and make plays, and I thought we did it tonight,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""We didn't score the last one, but we gave ourselves a chance."" Boston picked up the victory despite missing three starters. Kemba Walker was sidelined with a neck strain after a scary collision with a teammate last week. Gordon Hayward has a fractured hand and Daniel Theis was sick. ""It's one game. We've just got to find ways to win. We'll welcome Kemba back when he's healthy. Let him rest up,"" Brown said. ""We're just holding it down for him and Gordon until they make their return. It's great to find ways to win, even with injuries. We've got to continue to do that, and I'm looking forward to it."" Hield hit his 11th 3-pointer to cut Sacramento's deficit to 97-96. Brown countered with a short jumper in the lane before Cory Joseph tied it with a 3 in front of Boston's bench with 1:06 to play. With Boston clinging to its 103-102 edge, Tatum airballed a long shot from the right corner, and Hield grabbed the rebound with 5.7 seconds left. Bogdanovic's long jumper bounced off the rim, and the ball was tipped out of bounds in a battle for the rebound as the horn sounded. Hield scored 21 points in the third quarter, going 8 for 11 from the floor, including 5 of 8 from beyond the arc, and the teams entered the fourth tied at 75. Brown had nine in the quarter. ""In the third quarter, I felt good,"" he said. ""I just came in locked in. All it takes is one to go in, and it started trickling down the lineup."" But, at the start of the fourth, Hield headed to the locker room and a trainer was stretching both of Brown's legs while he was on his back at the side of the bench. Both returned midway into the final quarter. TIP-INS Kings: In their last meeting against the Celtics, Hield had a game-high 35 points for his only other 30-point game this season. It was his 10th career game of 30 or more, and three have come against Boston. ... Richaun Holmes entered tied for the league lead in field goal percentage (66.1). He went 4 for 6 and finished with 8 points. Celtics: Head team physician Dr. Tony Schena said Walker didn't suffer a serious injury, but the Celtics were going to keep him out until he goes through a full practice, which is expected to be Tuesday. The doctor said Walker didn't have a concussion, but the team is going through the protocol. . Hayward (fractured left hand) worked out Sunday without a brace and sat on the bench in street clothes without one Monday. . Smart had his left ring wrapped after the game. He said he jammed it. MOPPING UP The ball got stuck between the shot clock and top of backboard in the first quarter. Smart grabbed a mop, turned it upside down and pushed the ball free with the handle. YOUNG AT HEART Coach Brad Stevens joked about having so many young players on the court at the same time. ""Butler had older players today,"" he said of where he coached in college before the Celtics hired him.","401160886"
"MIAMI --  Bam Adebayo still remembers all the painful details of his rookie season, when the Miami Heat couldnt use him in a lot of situations because he was still learning everything. Those days are long gone. Adebayo scored 21 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, Jimmy Butler also scored 21 points and the Heat remained unbeaten at home with a 117-100 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. It was Adebayos ninth double-double this season, and the Heat are 9-0 in those games. I know humble beginnings, Adebayo said. I remember when I wasnt playing. So I always remember where I came from and from where I started. Ive worked hard for this. Kendrick Nunn scored 19 points, Tyler Herro added 18 and Kelly Olynyk finished with 15 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for Miami. The Heat are 7-0 at home for only the second time -- they went 8-0 at home to start the 2012-13 championship season. And they're not just winning at home, but they're winning big. The Heat have led by at least 15 points in all seven of their home games, by at least 20 in six of them. The margin on Monday night got up to 23. This is a step in the right direction, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Guys are taking it to heart. Terry Rozier had 19 points and nine assists for Charlotte, which has dropped five in a row. Devonte' Graham scored 16 and Malik Monk scored 13 for the Hornets, who were outrebounded 49-35. Rozier had a three-point play with 8:36 left to get Charlotte within 14, but an 11-2 run by the Heat over the next 4:18 put the game away. The message was the defense has to get better and has to improve, Hornets coach James Borrego said. Right now we're physically soft, we lack intensity on that end of the floor, when teams make runs we tend to hang our head and we've just got to get better. That comes with time, that comes with accountability and execution, and we've got to get better on that end of the floor."" Miami used nine players -- and had no others available. James Johnson was sent home pregame because he was sick, and Udonis Haslem was also out with an illness. Dion Waiters remains on his 10-game suspension, while Justise Winslow (concussion), Derrick Jones Jr. (hip) and KZ Okpala (Achilles) are still hurt. Winslow and Jones may practice Tuesday. The Heat were so thin depth-wise that when Olynyk got shaken up with an arm problem in the third quarter, he remained in the game despite being in obvious discomfort. Good teams take care of their business at home, Olynyk said. When teams come in here, we have to win, plain and simple. When you get in the playoffs, you have to win on your home floor. So it starts now. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte has now had separate losing streaks of three, four and five games already this season. ... The Hornets lost Cody Zeller in the third quarter to a left hip contusion. ... P.J. Washington, who scored 27 points in his first game and was averaging 13.1 points through his first 13 contests, scored only eight Monday. He has a total of 28 points in his last five games. Heat: Miami still has not trailed by more than eight at home this season, though that seemed in jeopardy when Charlotte ran out to a 7-0 lead to start the game. ... The Heat had a six-point trip in the second quarter. Nunn hit a 3-pointer while Olynyk was the recipient of a flagrant foul from Nicolas Batum. Olynyk made a free throw, then Herro made a long jumper on the ensuing Miami possession. BABY WATCH Spoelstra is keeping a phone nearby at all times these days, with good reason. Spoelstra and his wife Nikki are expecting their second child, one that could be arriving in the next few days. ""We have a little bit of time,"" he said. ""I also thought we had a little bit of time last time."" Spoelstra missed a game late in March 2018 when the couple's first son was born. GRAHAM RETURNS Graham didn't play in either of Charlotte's games in Miami last season, though Monday wasn't his first time on the Heat floor. He dropped 35 for Kansas in a game against Syracuse at Miami on Dec. 2, 2017 -- shooting 10 for 17 from the field, 7 for 13 from 3-point range.","401160887"

Pascal Siakam scored 25 points, Fred VanVleet added 24 and the Raptors held Embiid scoreless for the first time in his career in a 101-96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. ""I can't have this type of production,"" Embiid said. ""I would have never thought I would be here talking about zero points in an NBA game, but it is what it is. Some nights you make shots, some nights you don't. Some nights you're hot, some nights you're cold."" It was the first meeting between the teams since Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beater that bounced off the rim four times before dropping, the winning basket in Game 7 of the second round of the playoffs in May. Toronto went on to win its first NBA title, before Leonard left for the LA Clippers. Embiid, who was left tearful after that postseason defeat, didn't do much Monday to erase those bad memories. Still, his teammates didn't seem worried about their star center's scoreless outing. ""Everyone has down games,"" Sixers guard Ben Simmons said. ""No one is Superman. It happened tonight to Jo, but he's going to be good."" Embiid shot 0-for-11, missing all four of his shots from 3-point range and going 0-for-3 at the free throw line. He finished with a game-high 13 rebounds. ""Defensively, they're everywhere,"" Embiid said of the Raptors. ""They're so long and they make sure they pack the paint.'' Toronto's Marc Gasol scored just three points, but played a large part in controlling Embiid. ""I think you give Marc Gasol, a former Defensive Player of the Year, credit,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""It was a long night for Jo."" Embiid was playing for the fourth time in six days, but he denied feeling worn down by Philly's schedule. ""I didn't look fatigued, and I was definitely not fatigued,"" he said.

Philadelphia's Furkan Korkmaz hit a 3, Horford made a baseline jumper and Harris added a hook shot as the 76ers used a 7-0 run to build a 94-88 lead with 5:16 left to play. Powell and VanVleet hit 3-pointers that cut the gap to two, 96-94, but Toronto missed three straight chances to tie it. Gasol missed a pair from the line, a jump shot by Siakam missed the mark and Harris blocked Anunoby's fast-break drive after an Embiid turnover. Siakam ended Toronto's drought with a three-point play, giving the Raptors a one-point edge, 97-96, with 1:01 left. Siakam forced a turnover on an entry pass from Simmons with 12 seconds remaining to preserve Toronto's lead. VanVleet was fouled and made two shots, giving the Raptors a three-point cushion.

Anthony scored 25 points in just his fourth game of the season, CJ McCollum added 21 and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Chicago Bulls 117-94 on Monday night. Anthony was 10 for 20 from the field, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers. He had averaged 13 points on 15-for-44 (34.1%) shooting in his first three games. Its a humbling situation for me, but its a testament to the work Ive been putting in, he said. My body feels good, mentally I feel good. Besides sharp shooting behind the 3-point line, the 10-time All-Star featured his usual mid-range game and even had a dunk. Vintage, McCollum said. We pulled out some old, good wine in there. Getting to his spots, hitting 3s, he got a dunk and he was talking like he always does on defense. Anthony now has 25,615 career points to move ahead of Alex English (26,613) into 18th place on the NBAs career scoring list. You dont want to take none of that stuff for granted, he said.

LaVine was just 1 for 5 on 3-pointers two days after making 13 of 17 while scoring a career-high 49 points Saturday at Charlotte. We played against a good half-court defensive team, LaVine said.

""We threw everything at him. We threw everybody at him. We threw double-teams and he made plays out of the post,"" said Jazz guard Mike Conley. ""He got to the free throw line. When he started making the long-range shot, that really makes it tough. I was proud of the way we defended. We tried rebounding and tried to box him out, and he was too tall, too long."" Milwaukee led 120-113 with 1:24 left, but Bojan Bogdanovic countered with a 3-pointer and Donovan Mitchell followed with a layup to make 120-118 with 43 seconds left. The Bucks missed on their next possession, but Brook Lopez blocked Mitchell's driving layup attempt with 4.4 seconds remaining. Wesley Matthews added 19 points and Eric Bledsoe 13 for the Bucks, whose last loss was at Utah on Nov. 8. Bogdanovic had 24 points and Mitchell 20 for the Jazz, who were 21 of 45 on 3-pointers.

""Great game and all that. My second 50-point game of my career. Doing it with zero turnovers and all that, that's great.

""(We) had enough stops. More importantly, against a good team, we were able to make some shots. I was really pleased with the third quarter."" The Jazz used a 10-0 run early in the second quarter to go in front 35-25. Milwaukee missed seven consecutive shots during that span, including 0 for 5 from beyond the arc.

Bledsoe's short pull-up jumper from the right baseline was negated when he was called for an offensive foul for jumping back into Bogdanovic.

He had 12 points in the fourth quarter on 4-for-8 shooting along with five assists. James was surprised by the cheers given he was the recipient of thunderous boos when he played against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals with Miami. Im very appreciative because Ive definitely gotten a lot of boos in this building in my career, playing a lot of finals games in this building, James said. To be able to have that support and they respect the way I play the game and they love the Lakers, its just a very humbling moment. Lakers fans had a lot to cheer this season in San Antonio. The Lakers (15-2) have one game remaining against the Spurs on Feb. 4 in Los Angeles but have already won the three-game series against their longtime rivals in the Western Conference. Davis added 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Lakers in his final game before returning to New Orleans on Wednesday. LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and DeRozan added 22 for the Spurs. San Antonio fell to 6-12 after its 11th loss in 13 games. Aldridge started the game 3 for 4, including his 10th 3-pointer of the season, while primarily being defended by James. It was one of the few times the Spurs got the best of James. DeRozan competed for nine seasons with Toronto against James when he was with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Heat. DeRozan never got past James to reach the NBA Finals during his tenure with the Raptors. Its tough, LeBron is LeBron for a reason, DeRozan said. Hes been doing it for 17 years. I faced him a lot throughout my career. You just try to throw different looks at him, but a guy like that has seen every look, every combination of rotations. Youve just got to make it difficult and hope he misses. James finished 13 for 24 from the field and 4 for 7 on 3-pointers in 35 minutes. Trey Lyles blocked Davis short jumper in the paint with 20 seconds left in the first half. Dejounte Murray collected the block and sprinted downcourt for a layup but James ran down the Spurs speedy point guard and blocked his attempt from behind. The play was reminiscent of James block of Golden States Andre Iguodala with less than 2 minutes remaining in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, which the Cleveland Cavaliers won. James hit consecutive step-back 3-pointers in the fourth quarter that produced a 93-85 lead and followed it up with a drive and alley-oop pass to JaVale McGee for his 10th assist of the evening. TIP-INS Lakers: Danny Green, who played eight seasons in San Antonio including the 2014 championship season, received a huge ovation during starting lineup introductions. Green is 3-1 against the Spurs since his departure, averaging 6.5 points and 4.5 rebounds.  Los Angeles is 83-89 against the Spurs in the series history.  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is averaging 14 points and shooting 5 for 10 on 3-pointers against the Spurs this season.  Dwight Howard picked up his fifth foul with 19 seconds remaining in the third quarter. Howard finished with no points and a rebound in 18 minutes. Spurs: San Antonio opted to start Derrick White over Murray. White started at point guard last season after Murray suffered a knee injury during the preseason. Murray started the first 12 games he was active for but was replaced by Patty Mills and White in two games since while battling turnovers and inconsistency.  White joined Willie Anderson and Alvin Robertson as the only players in franchise history with 800 points, 300 rebounds and 300 assists in their first 100 career games with the Spurs. STILL UP San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich praised DeRozan and Aldridge for remaining positive during the Spurs recent skid. Got to. Got to, DeRozan said. Granted everybody hates losing, sucks to lose, but with that youve got to be resilient. Somebody once told me a mountain cant be a mountain if its smooth, whatever that may mean.","401160891"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Once Chris Paul gets in midrange jumper territory he considers it my version of a layup. Ill take that, he said. Paul hit a 19-footer with 36 seconds left to put Oklahoma City ahead and Alec Burks missed a contested shot in the paint moments later on the other end, sending the Thunder to their first road win of the season with a 100-97 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Nice. I didnt even know this was our first road win, Paul said. Thats sickening. That was crazy. ... Well take it, keep on moving. The Warriors led most of the way before the Thunder scored the final 13 points. Chaotic. We couldnt handle their defensive pressure, they turned it up and forced some turnovers, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ... It was frustrating because we had the game right in our grasp and just couldnt finish it off. More than anything I just feel sick for our guys because they continue to compete and work. They deserve better. But on the other hand we werent good enough to close the game out and so we didnt deserve to win. Glenn Robinson III scored 25 points and Ky Bowman added 24 as injury-plagued Golden State competed with just eight healthy players. The Warriors lost their third straight game and 10th in 11, committing five of their 12 turnovers in the final quarter. Its frustrating. Being a young team is not an excuse for that last four minutes of basketball we played, Robinson said. Eric Paschall contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds as injured Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson cheered their young teammates from the bench. Pauls 3-pointer with 3:01 remaining got the Thunder within 97-90 and Dennis Schroder hit from deep the next time down to make it a four-point game. Schroder scored 22 points off the bench and dished out five assists. Paul struggled early to find his shooting stroke but finished with 20 points, while Danilo Gallinari had 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Thunder moved to 1-6 on the road. Oklahoma City snapped a three-game skid -- those defeats coming by a combined 10 points. The Thunder also are without a key playmaker, losing guard Hamidou Diallo for four to six weeks with a hyperextension sprain in his right elbow. The Oklahoma City-Golden State matchup is a far cry from what it had been in recent years with Kevin Durant playing for the Warriors against his old team. Durant departed in the offseason to join the Brooklyn Nets. TIP-INS Thunder: C Nerlens Noel returned after missing Fridays game with an illness. ... The Thunder are 8-13 on the road against the Warriors during the OKC era ... Oklahoma City returns to Chase Center on March 28. ... The Thunder already beat the Warriors twice at home, including 120-92 on Oct. 27 to match their largest margin of victory against Golden State and led by 33 points at halftime. Warriors: Draymond Green missed a third straight game with a sore right heel. Its lingering, coach Steve Kerr said. It doesnt seem like its going to be anything that goes on for too long. Its also not something we want to aggravate and keep him out for a long period of time. ... D'Angelo Russell missed his fifth game in a row with a sprained right thumb but is expected to travel on the teams upcoming road trip and will be re-evaluated Saturday. The Warriors miss his playmaking, as Russell has dished out seven or more assists in each of his last four games. ... Willie Cauley-Stein had his career-best streak of at least one block end at nine straight games. ... Golden State trails the season series 3-0 after the two road losses. The Warriors won the regular-season series 2-1 last season. DIALLO HURT The Thunder announced Diallos status earlier Monday, saying he would be re-evaluated after that timeframe. In Fridays 130-127 home loss to the Lakers, Diallo left in the fourth quarter after taking contact from LeBron James on a driving layup early in the period. Diallo had just returned from a three-game absence for a sprained left knee. He has played in 12 games with one start, averaging 8.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals in 21.4 minutes. I think for him, being out for a couple games and then coming back and playing like he did, I think for any young player, the concern always for those guys is: Where am I going to fit in? How am I going to fit in when I get back? Am I behind the 8-ball, am I the last guy? coach Billy Donovan said. And thats not the case I think for our team. We need Hami and I told him that when he comes back were going to put him right back into the rotation and try to get him back to where he had been playing before the injury.","401160892"
"Paul George notes the Clippers offense is a work in progress, but the defense is cohesive and everyone is working together. (0:34) DALLAS --  Paul George and Kawhi Leonard gave the young European duo from the Dallas Mavericks the best look yet at life among the elite in the Western Conference. George scored 17 of his 26 points in the first quarter, Leonard finished with 28 and the Los Angeles Clippers took control early in a meeting of teams with matching five-game winning streaks, beating the Mavericks 114-99 on Tuesday night. The Clippers used several defenders to end Luka Doncic's franchise-record streak of four games with at least 30 points and 10 assists, knocking the 20-year-old phenom to the floor early on a 4-of-14 shooting night. Doncic had 22 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Kristaps Porzingis was 4 of 13, the 7-foot-3 Latvian combining with the Rookie of the Year from Slovenia to go 8 of 27 compared to 19 of 42 for the LA stars. George added a career-high six steals to help hold the Mavericks under 100 points for the first time this season. ""They're looking to win a championship; they played like it was a playoff game,"" said Porzingis, who hit a 28-footer 22 seconds into the game and another 3-pointer from the logo at center court just before halftime but finished 3 of 8 from long range. He had 15 points and 10 rebounds. ""They played aggressively and they showed us that we have to learn how to play these games. We have to bring that same intensity."" Patrick Beverley got in foul trouble as one of the defenders assigned to Doncic, who had to settle for doing most of his damage on free throws, making 14 of 16. Beverley getting his fourth foul early in the second half just brought back Lou Williams sooner. The high-scoring reserve finished with 21 points, going 4 of 7 on 3s while Doncic missed all seven of his deep tries against the LA defense. ""That's who we are as a team,"" said George, who had all four of his 3-pointers in the first quarter. ""We pride ourselves on defense. Offensively, we've got guys that can score the ball, but we want to make it tough on a nightly basis on whoever we're playing."" The Mavericks had taken the Southwest Division lead with a win at Houston for their fifth straight victory, and weren't too far removed from a loss to LeBron James and the Lakers that required a buzzer-beating 3 to force overtime in Dallas. But the other expected title contenders from LA offered a dose of reality for a team looking to end a three-season run without reaching the playoffs. Dallas was trailing by three when Doncic joined the rest of the starters on the bench in the final minute of the first quarter. By the time those five came back together in the second, the Los Angeles lead was 48-32. The LA bench scored 16 of the 20 points during the run, with Leonard getting the other four. The NBA's highest-scoring bench finished with 44 points. Dallas, fourth on that list, scored 37 bench points, most with the outcome no longer in doubt. ""They're big, they're strong, they're highly skilled,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""They pick you up full court and they hound you. This is a game we've got to learn from and do better next time."" TIP-INS Clippers: Montrezl Harrell scored 12 points two nights after tying his career high with 34 against New Orleans to help finish a sweep of a five-game homestand. ... Leonard had a team high-tying eight rebounds, and Williams had six rebounds and six assists. Mavericks: Doncic had a third straight game without a triple-double, the longest run without one this season for the NBA's leader in that category (seven). ... Dallas shot a season-low 38 percent. ... Seth Curry scored 13 off the bench, and J.J. Barea had 12. TURNOVER TIME Doncic committed seven turnovers and has six games with at least six turnovers this season. The Mavericks had 20, two off their season high in their second game with at least that many. ""Wanted to do the best job we could on Luka,"" Leonard said. ""He's been killing it lately, playing at a very, very high level. We just wanted to make it difficult for him tonight, get some deflections and I think we were able to do that."" COMFORTABLY IN FRONT The Clippers led by double digits most of the last three quarters, peaking at a 24-point lead with three minutes to go in the game. George put LA in front for good with a 3-pointer for a 23-21 lead with 4:25 left in the first quarter.","401160893"
"DENVER --  Gary Harris isn't putting up big scoring numbers. Its the guard's defense that has spearheaded the Denver Nuggets' rise to the top of the Western Conference. After another shutdown night, Harris teammates are campaigning for him to be on the NBA's all-defensive team. ""We're not joking around with first team,"" Jamal Murray said. ""He's been showing it. Not just one game, not just two games, but all season long."" Harris held Washington guard Bradley Beal to a season-low 14 points, Nikola Jokic had a season-high 20 rebounds and Jerami Grant added a season-best 20 points to lead the Nuggets to a 117-104 win over the Wizards on Tuesday night. Jokic finished one rebound shy of his career best and scored eight points in Denver's sixth straight win. Will Barton had 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, Murray added 16 points and Mason Plumlee scored 15 for the Nuggets, who are 10-1 in November and ended a three-game home losing streak against Washington. Beal, the Wizards leading scorer averaging 29.6 points, failed to score 20 points for the first time this season and was held to 6-for-15 shooting. He was 2 of 10 from behind the 3-point line. ""Anytime you can manage the best player on the other team, you start with that,"" Plumlee said. ""Brad Beal's a heck of a player and he didn't get 20, 30 points."" It is a familiar theme when the Nuggets face an elite guard. Houston's James Harden scored just 27 points, 10 below his season average, and Devin Booker had just 12 when Phoenix was in Denver on Sunday night. ""That's all Gary,"" Grant said. ""He's locking everybody up this year. He's shutting everyone down."" Denver held one of the NBA's prolific offenses to its second-fewest point total of the season. Washington entered the game averaging 119.1 points and had failed to score at least 100 points just once in 15 games. It needed 35 in the fourth to reach 100 this time. Jordan McRae had 21 points and Moritz Wagner and Davis Bertans each finished with 14. The Nuggets grabbed control in the second quarter, opening a 17-point lead after Washington led 27-26 early in the period. Grant had 15 points in the second and 16 in the half as Denver took a 64-47 lead into the break. ""They did a good job all night just trying to get downhill,"" McRae said. ""I think we have to do a better job of helping each other going up in the paint, just knowing everybody has everybody's back."" The Nuggets pushed the lead to 20 points in the third quarter and after Washington closed within 14 midway through the fourth quarter, Barton converted a rare 4-point play to make it 107-89. Those were the only four points of the fourth for Barton, who was the only Denver starter to play in the quarter. Denver shot 52.2 percent and had 70 points in the paint. ""We gave them no resistance. There was no physicality,"" Wizards coach Scotty Brooks said. ""When you don't give any resistance to a great team, they're going to get 70 points in the paint."" TIP-INS Wizards: Guard Isaiah Thomas received warm applause from the crowd when he was announced as a starter. He played 12 games with the Nuggets last season. ... Washington was 1 of 16 from the 3-point line in the first half and finished 10 of 40 from behind the arc. Nuggets: Their last home win against the Wizards was March 12, 2016. Denver outscored Washington by 24 in the fourth quarter to win by 16. ... The Nuggets weren't called for a foul in the first quarter. They picked up six in the first 2:46 of the second quarter. ...

"Kemba details how missing one game helped him figure out different ways to help the Celtics win. (1:18) BOSTON --  Kemba Walker scored 39 points in his first game back after leaving the court on a stretcher, with his neck in a brace. It was almost enough to make the Boston fans forget about the guy he replaced. But not quite. On a night the fans seemed more interested in taunting former Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving, Walker returned from a neck injury to score a season high and lead Boston to a 121-110 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. ""I've been over it. I could have played last game, honestly,"" Walker said. ""If I'm on the court, I'm on the court. I wasn't thinking about anything (but) wanting to win."" Walker left Boston's game against Denver on Friday after a head-to-torso collision with Semi Ojeleye and missed Monday's game against Sacramento. He played 31 minutes on Wednesday, adding six rebounds and four assists. He scored 13 in the third quarter, when the Celtics scored nine in a row to turn a one-point deficit into a 91-83 lead they never relinquished. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said sometimes head-first collisions can be serious even though they don't look all that bad, and sometimes the ones that look bad turn out to be minor. ""For him to be playing, and even feeling fresh, five days later is very fortunate,"" Stevens said. ""It's good to see."" Jaylen Brown added 22 points and 10 rebounds and Jayson Tatum had 16 points and nine boards for the Celtics, who improved to 7-0 at home. Garrett Temple scored 22 points and Joe Harris had 21 for Brooklyn, which made a season-high 21 of the 56 3-point shots it attempted. Jarrett Allen had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and Spencer Dinwiddie had 16 points and 11 assists. But the biggest name for the Nets -- at least as far as the Boston fans were concerned -- was Irving, who has missed the last seven games with a sore shoulder. The crowd came to heckle him, even in his absence. Posters branding him as a coward decorated the arena entrance. A few fans who showed up wearing his No. 11 Celtics jersey with the words ""Where is?"" written on tape above his name. During the introductions, with Irving nowhere to be seen, the first ""Kyrie Sucks!"" chant broke out; it was repeated about a dozen times throughout the game. (There was also a ""Yankees Suck!"" chant, just because.) ""I don't give a second thought,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Just tune it out."" About an hour after the game ended, Irving posted a long Instagram story calling sports and entertainment ""ignorant and obtrusive."" ""It's one big show that means very VERY little in the real world that most people live in,"" the lengthy and rambling post said before concluding with: ""Don't fall for the Game that's played in front of you for Entertainment, it'll never be as serious dealing with LIFE."" The Nets, like the Celtics before them, are doing better without him. They came into the night with a 5-1 record since Irving went out with a sore shoulder, climbing above .500 for the first time this season. The Celtics made it to the Eastern Conference finals two years ago when Irving was injured, and lost in the second round last season with him. TIP-INS Nets: Have not beaten the Celtics in Boston in their last seven tries. They had won three in a row on the road; they have not won four straight road games since 2008. Celtics: Injured forward Gordon Hayward took the microphone to wish the crowd a happy Thanksgiving before the opening tip. TURNING POINT Brooklyn led 83-82 with just over 3 minutes left in the third when the Celtics scored the next nine points before Temple made a 3 to close out the third quarter. Boston led 104-101 in the fourth before scoring 17 of the next 24 points -- nine of them from Walker -- to put away the game. MAN OF MANY TALENTS When the ball got stuck between the backboard and the shot clock in the final minutes, Celtics guard Marcus Smart grabbed a mop to jar it loose. The fans responded with an ""M-V-P!"" chant. Smart also pulled off a similar rescue on Monday night. ""He's one of a kind,"" Stevens deadpanned. ""We knew when that ball was stuck behind the backboard there was only one man to get it done.""","401160895"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nothing seems to help the Charlotte Hornets shake out of a slump better than the Detroit Pistons. Bismack Biyombo scored 19 points, Devonte Graham had 16 points and a career-high 15 assists and the Hornets beat the Pistons for the eighth straight time with a 102-101 victory on Wednesday night. Rookie P.J. Washington added 17 points, Miles Bridges had 15 and Nic Batum 13 for Charlotte (7-11), which snapped a five-game losing streak. The Hornets haven't lost to the Pistons since the 2017-18 season. Blake Griffin scored 26 points for Detroit. Charlotte has only had three longer winning streaks against an opponent. The Hornets won 13 in a row over Orlando from 2016-18, 11 straight over the Pistons from 1993-95 and nine consecutive over the Chicago Bulls from 1999-01. ""We just shared the ball, played for each other and we care about each other,"" said Biyombo, who was making his second start of the season. ""I think that's the most important thing because at the end of the day we are all we got. The guys embraced the challenge from the coach yesterday as we came in."" Charlotte coach James Borrego said that challenge was improve on the defensive end. ""Well, the last 24 hours, 48 hours, we talked about our defense,"" said Borrego, whose team entered the game 21st in the NBA in scoring defense at 113.9 points per game. ""I thought we got off to a good start defensively. We really did. ""Tonight was about our defense. That's what got it done."" The Hornets withstood a final Detroit possession that didn't end with a shot attempt despite three inbounds attempts in the final 12.3 seconds. After the final one with 7.9 seconds to play, Derrick Rose drove into the lane before passing to Luke Kennard on the left baseline. But Kennard couldn't get a shot off before the buzzer. ""I got it at the top,"" said the veteran Rose, who is playing his first season with Detroit. ""It was the spacing that was messed up. You live and you learn. First year with the team so you figure it out."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey knew it was a missed opportunity. ""Would've, could've, should've,"" said Casey, whose team lost 109-106 at Charlotte in the teams' first meeting on Nov. 15 on Malik Monk's 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""It always looks like it comes down the last play and the execution of it. Just scoring a little quicker and that comes from being together and understanding what we are doing. I can't fault anybody on that last play but just go a little quicker. We got what we wanted and were about to get what we wanted but just (go) a little sooner."" Charlotte scored the game's first six points and led 25-14 with 5:11 left in the first quarter before the Pistons closed out the quarter strong to take a 32-31 lead. Detroit maintained a 60-55 halftime lead before Charlotte retook the lead for good at 82-80 late in the third quarter. A pair of 3-pointers by Griffin in the final 4:13 cut the Hornets' lead to 95-94 with 4:13 to play and then 102-101 with 41 seconds left. TIP-INS: Pistons: Guard/forward Tony Snell played in his first game since Nov. 15 after missing four games with a left hip strain. Snell, who entered averaging 9.2 points, came off the bench and went scoreless in 19 minutes. He missed both field goal attempts, including one 3-pointer. Hornets: Center Cody Zeller didn't play after a left hip injury in Monday's 117-100 loss at Miami. It was the second game this season that Zeller has missed; he missed the Oct. 25 loss to Minnesota due to personal reasons. Since Zeller's rookie year of 2013-14 when he played in all 82 games, he has missed 20, nine, 20, 49 and 33 games, respectively, in the previous five seasons.","401160896"
"CLEVELAND --  The short-handed Orlando Magic finally left a road arena with a victory. Evan Fournier scored a season-high 30 points and the Magic won away from home for first time this season, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 116-104 on Wednesday night. The Magic, playing without center Nikola Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon, were 0-7 on the road going into the game. ""The guys could have put their heads down and mailed it in at the end of a road trip, but they fought through it tonight,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Vucevic and Gordon both missed their third straight game with right ankle injuries, but the Magic didn't need two of their top players. ""The way we came out with defense and playing hard, that's a true test of character,"" Fournier said. Not only has Cleveland lost eight of nine, Kevin Love's sore back continues to be an issue. The veteran forward returned after missing two games but was limited to 24 minutes, scoring nine points and grabbing five rebounds. Love went to the locker room early in the second half and returned to play five minutes in the fourth quarter before being removed. Cavaliers coach John Beilein said Love wasn't himself and isn't sure what the next step will be in dealing with the injury. ""I have no idea how to interpret it yet,"" Beilein said. ""If you've had a bad back, from one day to another day you don't know what it's going to be like. He wants to go out there and give it his all. He wants to play even when he's hurt. When he's out there playing hurt but he can't move the way he functionally needs to move, it's not good for him and it's not good for us."" Terrence Ross and Jonathan Isaac each scored 16 points for Orlando, which went ahead for good early in the second quarter and steadily built the lead. Cleveland cut a 17-point deficit to 98-90 midway through the fourth, but Markelle Fultz and Mo Bamba hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions for the Magic. Fournier was 10 of 22 from the field and made all six of his free throws, falling two points shy of his career high. Cleveland committed a season-high 25 turnovers. Collin Sexton scored 20 points and rookie Darius Garland added 16, but also had eight turnovers. Orlando, which led by nine at halftime, used a 13-3 run to begin the third quarter to go ahead 72-55 for its biggest lead. The Magic maintained a double-figure advantage for most of the second half. Vucevic averages a team-high 11.6 rebounds and is Orlando's second-leading scorer at 17.1 points per game. Gordon averages 13.1 points and 6.2 rebounds. Tristan Thompson had 13 points and 15 rebounds for Cleveland. TIP-INS Magic: Fultz and Bamba each scored 15 points. ... D.J. Augustin had 10 assists. ... Gordon went through drills during shootaround, but still isn't ready to play. Cavaliers: Love didn't play against Portland on Saturday when Cleveland broke a six-game losing streak. He also missed Monday's loss to Brooklyn. ... C John Henson hasn't played since the second game of the season because of a strained right hamstring. ""He decided he was not ready yet, that he needs more time to heal,"" Beilein said. IT'S NOT EASY Vucevic and Gordon were injured against Toronto and didn't play against Indiana or Detroit. ""It stinks having a teammate down like Vuch and Aaron, but you have to do your job and do your best,"" Bamba said. THAT'S TOO MANY Beilein was unhappy with the turnovers, which included several traveling violations. ""You have 25 turnovers in a game, you're not going to win,"" he said. ""It's one thing if we're throwing the ball away, but not getting a shot at the basket because of a walk, I've got to figure that out.""","401160897"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers have found the perfect early season balance. They're moving the ball, sharing the scoring burden and finding ways to win. On Wednesday night, Domantas Sabonis and T.J. Warren each scored 23 points and Malcolm Brogdon added 22 to spur a decisive fourth-quarter run that helped Indiana pull away from Utah 121-102. ""When you have a number of guys who can score and they're offensive-minded, what you have to get is that team to sacrifice,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""These guys are sacrificing right now."" And it's showing up in the results. Since losing their first three games, the Pacers have won 11 of 14 including four straight. Four of their last five wins have come by double digits and they've done it by taking advantage of their collective strengths. Sabonis again did the dirty work inside, grabbing 12 rebounds for his 12th double-double this season. Brogdon and Jeremy Lamb took care of their job in the backcourt by flirting with their own double-doubles. Brogdon added eight assists while Lamb had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Defensively, the Pacers were just as proficient. They held the Jazz to 43.4% shooting and just 10 of 32 on 3-pointers while Bojan Bogdanovic and Donovan Mitchell accounted for more than half of Utah's total points. Bogdanovic, who left the Pacers last summer in free agency, scored 30 in his first game back. Mitchell added 26 and the Jazz spent the entire second half futilely chasing the Pacers before losing its second straight game. ""They felt comfortable the entire time,"" Mitchell said. ""We've got to get over screens, helping, the bigs, the guards, it's really all of us just communicating (better on defense) and we'll fix it."" At least, Utah made the Pacers earn this one. When it appeared Indiana might run away after closing the first half on a 12-2 spurt and opening the second half with a 3-pointer from Myles Turner to take a 56-43 lead, Bogdanovic and Mitchell helped the Jazz respond. They combined for five of Utah's seven 3s in the third quarter, helping them scramble back within 83-80 with 2:03 to go. But Indiana rebuilt its lead by scoring the final six points of the quarter and finally put the game away with that decisive 18-5 run, which began with 7:45 left to play. ""We came ready to play,"" Brogdon said. ""We competed from the first minute to the last. The second group came in and did a great job. We were consistent all the way through."" TIP-INS Jazz: Have lost three straight in the series and back-to-back games for the third time this season. ... Two-time defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert returned after missing the previous two games with a sprained left ankle and had 14 points and 13 rebounds. ... Joe Ingles scored 12 points and Mike Conley had five points and five assists in his hometown.

"Staff Sergeant Ivan Thomas has an emotional moment as he reunites with his son after being deployed for 18 months. (0:25) PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid got back to playing the kind of game he expects from himself and nothing like the worst game of his career two nights prior. Embiid had 33 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 97-91 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. He was scoreless Monday night in a 101-96 loss at Toronto. In 32 minutes against the Raptors, the star big man went 0-for-11 from the field, including 0-for-4 from the arc and missed all three of his free throws. Against the Kings, he scored the first points of the game with an emphatic dunk 23 seconds in and had some key points late in the game to help Philadelphia improve to 8-0 at home. He finished 10-of-19 from the field and 12-of-14 from the free throw line. ""I should play like that every night,"" Embiid said. ""After the last performance, I had to be a little more aggressive."" Embiid said he felt more ""free"" than he did being guarded by Toronto's Marc Gasol and a constant double-teamer, and Kings coach Luke Walton said his team wasn't able to execute its plan. ""Our plan was to double, but we didn't do a good job early,"" he said. ""We were soft and late."" Of Embiid's 14 trips to the foul line, Walton said, ""We have to be more disciplined."" Philadelphia rookie Matisse Thybulle scored all 15 of his career-best points in the second half. Thybulle was needed after Josh Richardson didn't return in the second half due to right hamstring tightness. Thybulle, who entered averaging 3.4 points, added four steals and two blocks while making all five of his shots, including three 3-pointers. ""You have to be ready for every opportunity,"" Thybulle said. Buddy Hield scored 22 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 18 for the Kings. They were 1-3 on a four-game trip. Hield, coming off a career-high 41 points at Boston on Monday night, made 3 of 12 3-pointers and 9 of 24 shots overall. Sacramento closed within five, 92-87, thanks to a 14-2 run. But Embiid scored from close to put the 76ers up 94-87 and then hit a pair from the line to make it 96-87 with 1:41 left. SHOOTING SIMMONS? Ben Simmons' continued reluctance to shoot conventional jump shots remains an issue in Philadelphia. Simmons hit his first career 3-pointer against the Knicks on Nov. 20, but he hasn't tried a true 3 -- his shot-clock heave Monday at Toronto notwithstanding. Coach Brett Brown repeatedly has defended his star point guard, saying that his jump shot will come in time. He again was asked several times prior to Wednesday's game about Simmons' shot. ""In general, I want him to shoot more,"" Brown said. ""There are available shots he can look at more."" Brown said it's something Simmons continues to work on in practice. Simmons drained a 13-foot turnaround jumper with 6:40 left in the first half, but then didn't touch rim with a try from similar distance a little under a minute later. Simmons finished with 10 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. HOME SWEET HOME Philadelphia remained undefeated at home while selling out for the 101st straight contest. ""We love playing at home,"" Brown said. ""This crowd respects, appreciates and pays for effort, and for the most part, I think that we give it."" TIP-INS Kings: De'Aaron Fox (ankle) missed his eighth straight contest, and Trevor Ariza (personal) was out for his fifth straight game. ... The teams wrap up the two-game season series on March 5 at Sacramento. ... Philadelphia fans booed Nemanja Bjelica, who spurned the 76ers for Europe prior to last offseason. 76ers: Kyle O'Quinn (left calf) and Shake Milton (upper respiratory infection) didn't play. ... Richardson had nine points in 17 first-half minutes.","401160899"
"TORONTO --  Pascal Siakam produced a big night from 3-point range to keep the Toronto Raptors perfect at home. Siakam scored 31 points, OG Anunoby had 13 points and a career-high 12 rebounds and the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 126-98 on Wednesday night, Toronto's franchise-record eighth straight home victory to begin the season. Siakam matched his career high by making five 3-pointers and shot 12 for 22 overall. ""He just keeps seeing them and fires them in there,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Siakam reached 30 or more points for the seventh time this season after having done so five times previously in his career, all last season. ""I'm just continuing to work hard,"" Siakam said. ""Shooting is a part of my game that I continue to work on."" Chris Boucher had 13 points and a season-high 12 rebounds, and Fred VanVleet and Terence Davis each scored 15 points as the Raptors set an NBA record by winning their 33rd straight at home against Atlantic Division opponents. Since divisional play began in the 1970-71 season, only Utah (Nov. 15, 1996 to April 12, 1999) and Golden State (Oct. 30, 2013 to April 12, 2017) have won 32 straight home games against division foes. New York was the opponent the last time Toronto lost at home to an Atlantic team, beating the Raptors 111-109 on Nov. 10, 2015. Julius Randle scored 19 points and Canadian rookie RJ Barrett had 16 as the Knicks matched a season worst by losing their fourth straight. The 28-point margin was New York's worst of the season. The Knicks lost 118-95 to Boston on Oct. 26. ""Right now we're still fighting that fight to trust each other offensively and defensively,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. Malcolm Miller scored a career-high 13 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 12 as the Raptors won their fifth straight, their longest streak of the season. Toronto has won seven in a row against the Knicks, and 15 of the past 16 meetings. Barrett returned after missing Sunday's loss to Brooklyn because of illness. ""I just soldiered through it,"" Barrett said. ""Getting a couple of days or rest really helped me."" The Toronto-born Barrett received a warm ovation when he was introduced with the rest of New York's starting lineup. Barrett shot 5 for 17, going 2 for 8 from 3-point range, in 31 minutes. ""You've got to give their defense credit,"" Fizdale said. ""Those guys really get after it. They're long, they make everything tough. That's not an easy team to just come in and drop numbers on."" Toronto led 10-3 after three minutes but Randle scored 11 points as the Knicks rallied to lead 29-21 after one. Wayne Ellington made three free throws to begin the second, giving the Knicks a 32-21 lead, but New York didn't score again until a basket by Marcus Morris with 7:15 left in the half. Davis and Siakam each made 3-pointers and Siakam added a free throw on Randle's technical foul to cap a 22-2 Toronto run. Siakam scored 15 points in the second and the Raptors led 58-46 at halftime. ""We never were able to answer the run once we were up 11,"" Randle said. Siakam scored 11 points in the third and Toronto took an 89-69 lead to the fourth. TIP-INS Knicks: New York is 1-8 on the road. . G Frank Ntilikina started despite a left quadriceps contusion and a sore groin. . Seven of New York's 14 losses have been by 10 or more points. Raptors: Toronto didn't shoot any free throws in the first quarter. .. Like the Raptors, Boston (7-0), Miami (7-0) and Philadelphia (8-0) have yet to lose at home. . Toronto won seven straight home games to begin the 2018-19 season. . Anunoby recorded his first career double-double. ... The Raptors led by double digits the entire second half. FINDING THEIR RANGE The Raptors shot 3 for 13 from 3-point range in the first quarter but went 18 for 28 the rest of the way. Toronto matched a franchise high with 21 made 3-pointers. It's the third time the Raptors have made 21 3s in a game. KIND OF A BIG DEAL Before his first game in Canada, Barrett spoke to a large crowd of media after the morning shootaround. ""I feel like the president or something,"" said Barrett, who estimated some 300 friends and family were attending the game.","401160900"
"HOUSTON --  When opponents trap and double team James Harden and Russell Westbrook it leaves openings for other players to step up and contribute. On Wednesday night that player was Danuel House, who had a career-high 23 points to help the Rockets to a 117-108 victory over the Miami Heat. ""When those two guys get going downhill it puts a lot of pressure on a lot of people which causes me to be open-open,"" House said. ""So thank you Russ and James."" Harden scored 34 points, Westbrook had 27 and the Rockets snapped a three-game skid. Harden said House is getting better at taking advantages of opportunities when teams double him. ""He works every single day on his shot,"" Harden said. ""Those opportunities are going to come for him and the more confident he gets the easier those shots will be."" Houston led by double digits for most of this one after the Heat used a 46-point first quarter in a 129-100 rout Nov. 3 in the first meeting between the teams this season. ""In the first half we just didn't bring the right competitive, consistent spirit, particularly when we weren't making shots,"" Heat coach Eric Spoelstra said. Kelly Olynyk scored six straight points to get the Heat within 10 with about a minute left. Harden made a free throw after that and Goran Dragic made one for the Heat. There was a bit of a scuffle after a hard foul by Dragic on House with about 30 seconds remaining. It was reviewed and upgraded to a flagrant 1 foul and House received a technical foul for his reaction after the foul. Tyler Herro had 22 points and Olynyk scored 19 points with leading scorer Jimmy Butler out with an illness. Westbrook had nine rebounds and seven assists and Houston had 11 steals they converted into 22 points. Herro scored five straight points for Miami to cut the lead to 17 with about 9 1/2 minutes left. But he turned the ball over on a bad pass after that and House finished with a dunk on the other end to lead Houston up 96-77. The Heat used a 10-3 run, with four points from Justise Winslow, to get to 103-91 with about 5 minutes left. Harden, who finished with seven 3s, made an off-balance 3-pointer from the corner before the Heat got one from Olynyk. A layup by Herro cut the lead to 13 with less than three minutes left before Houston used a 5-2 run with a 3 from House to make it 114-98. Houston led by at least 20 for most of the third quarter and pushed the lead to 86-62 with a dunk by Ben McLemore with about two minutes left in the third quarter. The Heat used a 6-2 spurt, with 3s from Olynyk and Herro, to cut the lead to 20. But Houston scored the last three points of the quarter to take a 91-68 lead into the fourth quarter. After coming out flat in a 137-123 loss to Dallas on Sunday, the Rockets started strong on Wednesday. Harden and Westbrook combined for 42 points in the first half as they built a 66-42 lead. TIP-INS Heat: Miami got 51 points off the bench. ... Bam Adebayo led the Heat's starters with 17 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Heat made 14 of 37 3-pointers. Rockets: C Clint Capela missed the game with a respiratory illness. ... Westbrook received a technical foul in the fourth quarter for yelling at an official when he was unhappy he didn't get a foul call. IMPROVING CLARK Second-year player Gary Clark had 12 points and tied a career-best with eight rebounds in 29 minutes helping to fill in for Capela. Clark hasn't gotten much playing time this season and had logged just 10 minutes this season entering Wednesday's game. ""His number was called and he was ready to go after not really having an opportunity this season,"" Harden said. ""That shows he's learning.""","401160901"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  When Lou Williams missed a floater in the closing seconds, Montrezl Harrell cleaned it up with a dunk to extend the Los Angeles Clippers winning streak. Harrells rebound basket with 2.3 seconds left gave the Clippers their seventh straight victory, 121-119 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. I expected to make the shot, but Im so happy ... that he was there for me, said Williams, who had 24 points and 13 assists. Memphis had one more chance to tie or take the lead, but Jaren Jackson Jr.s 3-point attempt from the right corner was blocked by Maurice Harkless. Harrell and Williams contributed to another strong bench performance from the Clippers, who lead the league with 51.7 points a game from their reserves. Harrell matched Williams with 24 while also grabbing 10 rebounds. Paul George added 22 points. Its just fantastic, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said about having Harrell and Williams off his bench. Its like you have the ultimate relief pitchers coming in the game Its come down to the point where, I think we kind of know each other and know kind of what each other wants to do. Each others tendencies, Harrell said of the reserves play, later adding: Weve got so many different lineups we can throw out there that we can succeed in. Playing the second night of a back-to-back on the road, Los Angeles forward Kawhi Leonard took the night off to with injury management on his left knee. Jonas Valanciunas had 30 points and 16 rebounds for Memphis, both season highs for the center. Jae Crowder and Ja Morant finished with 20 points each, Morant also had 11 assists as the Grizzlies lost their fifth straight. Memphis, which trailed 92-88 entering the fourth, opened the final period on a 13-2 run. That gave Memphis its biggest lead of the game at that point and led to Rivers calling a timeout after Crowder converted his second 3-pointer from the top of the key. We were just playing with energy, said Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who finished with 17 points. The bench came in and made a huge impact. Everyone was running in there and having fun again. The defense just led to the offense more. While Memphis lead reached 10 with just under 7 minutes left, the Clippers had a 15-5 run to tie at 113. The teams exchange leads and the game was tied at 119 before Harrells winning basket. I just try to keep playing, keep executing, just keep fighting all the way through, Harrell said. Thats what it is all about, fighting all the way through to the very end. Leave it all out there. Thats all we can do. TIP-INS Clippers: Rodney McGruder started in Leonards spot, his second start of the season. McGruder would leave in the third quarter with a right lower leg injury. He did not return. ... F Landry Shamet missed his ninth straight game with a high left ankle sprain. Grizzlies: F Kyle Anderson, who was listed as questionable because of right heel soreness, did not play. ... The Clippers held Morant to one shot and no points in the first half. The rookie scored 14 points in the fourth. ... Memphis challenged an out-of-bounds call in the fourth giving the ball to the Clippers. After review, the call was overturned. CLARKE CONNECTION Memphis rookie Brandon Clarke, the 21st overall pick from Gonzaga, was 5 of 8 from the field and has made 60 of 88 over his last 10 games, for 68% over the span. Clarke entered the game leading all rookies in shooting percentage for the season at 63.6%, which also ranks fifth overall. FINAL WORD I just thought you let a team that hasnt been winning hang around, they start to smell it. We talked about it before the game. Obviously, no one heard it. -- Rivers.","401160902"
"MILWAUKEE --  Without Khris Middletons productive return, the Milwaukee Bucks might not have outlasted the Atlanta Hawks. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 10 rebounds, Middleton scored 16 points in his return from injury and the Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 111-102 for their ninth consecutive victory. Middleton, who had been out since Nov. 10 with a thigh contusion, didnt start and played 20 minutes. He helped the Bucks rally after they trailed through three quarters. ""I think guys were trying to pull it together and trying to fight through a little bit of fatigue or (being) banged up,"" the All-Star forward said. ""We're still figuring out ways to win ballgames, which is the most important thing."" Antetokounmpo followed his season-high 50 points on Monday by notching his 18th consecutive double-double. The reigning MVPs streak of double-doubles is the longest to begin a season since Bill Walton opened with 34 straight in 1976-77. Antetokounmpo was 5 for 13 from the free throw line for the Eastern Conference leaders, on their longest winning streak since winning 10 straight in 1985-86. Former Bucks forward Jabari Parker scored a season-high 33 points for the Hawks and added 14 rebounds, also a season high. Trae Young scored 29 points as Atlanta (4-14) dropped its eighth straight. Its always going to be about putting that complete game together and understanding from a strategic standpoint, from a game-plan standpoint, from an effort standpoint, how to do that,"" said Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce. ""The makes and misses arent the issue. Parker, who played for Milwaukee from 2014-18, scored the Hawks first eight points on their way to a 17-15 lead. Then Milwaukee scored 18 straight, getting seven from Middleton, to jump to a 33-17 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Hawks battled back in the second period, behind Parkers 15 points and Youngs 14. By the time Young drained a 3-pointer at the buzzer going into halftime, they had shaved the Bucks lead to 60-59. The Hawks took an 82-81 lead into the fourth, but Antetokounmpo sparked the crowd by scoring over Parker on a drive to the hoop and drawing Parkers fourth foul. Robin Lopez tipped in Antetokounmpos missed free throw, giving Milwaukee an 87-84 lead with just over 10 minutes left. ""The fourth quarter is where we lost, so I'd rather have the momentum at the right time,"" said Parker, who scored only two in the fourth. The game stayed tight until Middleton hit a 3-point basket with just under 4 minutes left to put Milwaukee up 102-93. Milwaukee held Atlanta to 43 points in the second half. TIP-INS Hawks: Guard Kevin Huerter (left rotator cuff strain) missed his eighth straight game. He has also been ruled out for the next two games, on Friday and Saturday. Bucks: Middleton, the teams second-leading scorer who entered Wednesday averaging 18.5 points per game, had been expected to miss three to four weeks. Its probably going to be one or two games and hell be starting, coach Mike Budenholzer said. ... Guard George Hill (back soreness) was out for a second straight game. NET PLUS Entering Wednesday, Milwaukee guard Sterling Brown had the leagues best net rating of 19.6. That is the Bucks point differential per 100 possessions while he is on the court. His teammate, guard Donte DiVincenzo, was second (17). DOUBLES DUTY Parker has scored in double figures in 17 of 18 games. ""It's insane what this kid has gone through,"" Antetokounmpo said of Parker, who suffered two torn ACLs in Milwaukee. ""He's back, he's healthy. He's jumping out of the gym and shooting 3s. I'm really happy for him. I know he had a lot of dark times after both injuries he had, but he's back.""","401160903"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Minnesota Timberwolves six-year stretch of misery in San Antonio is over. Andrew Wiggins scored 26 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 14 rebounds and the Timberwolves beat the Spurs 113-101 on Wednesday night, snapping an 11-game skid in San Antonio. I know I havent won here, Wiggins said, laughing. So, when I heard it, I was like, It sounds correct.  Minnesotas last victory in San Antonio was April 17, 2013, when Wiggins was a high school senior. The Timberwolves overcame a charge fueled in large part by second-year player Lonnie Walker IV to hand the Spurs their fifth straight home loss. Walker has received limited playing time this season but the made the most of a season-high 13 minutes. Lonnie was fantastic, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. He has kept himself ready and we gave him a shot to play tonight and obviously he was up to the challenge. He did a really good job. But it wasnt enough to stop the Spurs from losing their second straight and 12th in 14 games. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points and DeMar DeRozan added 20 for the Spurs (6-13). Walker added 11, all in the second half. Minnesota had a season-high 18 3-pointers, shooting 45% on 3s. San Antonio was 5 for 29 on 3-pointers in comparison. Just getting caught in rotation, not helping the next man, DeRozan said of the defensive issues. Weve got to be there for one another. Guys are too good in the league just to depend on one guy to stop one guy on a team. The Timberwolves (10-8) led by as many as 13 points but had to fight off a rally that bridged the third and fourth quarters. Minnesota was assessed three technical fouls for arguing with officials in a one-minute span in the third quarter. Robert Covington was given the first with 6:48 remaining in the third, followed 48 seconds later by Towns. A third was given to the teams bench with 5:47 left. Walker fueled the momentum when he entered with 4:36 to go in the third quarter. Walker sank a 3-pointer and followed with a driving layup to pull San Antonio within 75-72. Walker would score nine points in the quarter on 4-for-5 shooting. Just energy, Walker said. Doing what Pop tells me to do. Be a defensive stopper, play the best I can and just the run the floor. Just be an energy guy. A layup by Walker and consecutive buckets by DeRozan put the Spurs up 92-91 with 5:56 remaining, their first lead since the end of the first quarter. Minnesota responded with a seven-point run to quiet the crowd and regain control. We just stayed composed, Wiggins said. We didnt let anyone faze us. Its always tough to play here, so we had to stay true to ourselves and execute. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota rookie Jarrett Culver, who attended Texas Tech, received a hearty ovation during pregame introductions. Culver made his eighth start in 18 games.  Trevor Graham limped off the court with 8:19 remaining in the game and did not return. Graham, who was listed as probable with a bruised left forearm, had three points and two rebounds in 13 minutes.  Josh Okogie, who was listed as probable with a sore left foot, had 11 points in 24 minutes.  Shabazz Napier missed the game with a strained right hamstring. Spurs: Aldridge has 18,958 points, passing Hall of Famer Scottie Pippens 18,941 career total for 59th on the leagues scoring list.  Center Chimezie Metu missed the game with a sore left foot. Metu, in his second year out of USC, is averaging 2.7 points in 3.7 minutes in six appearances this season.  San Antonio is 4-6 at home this season. The Spurs last home victory was Nov. 7 against Oklahoma City.  Walkers career high is 16 points, which he scored against Denver on April 3. SOCIAL OUTCAST DeRozan recently deleted all his Instagram posts, fueling speculation that he was unhappy with the Spurs and that he is on the verge of being traded. DeRozan said its all nothing. I dont even like social media, honestly, DeRozan said. Im not a big fan of social media, never been. To this day I always wish I had played in the 90s so I wouldnt deal with social media. I just let people talk. Me, personally, I hate it. So, there is nothing anyone should read into deleting the posts? I hate it, DeRozan reiterated. If it wasnt a need in 2019, I wouldnt have it.","401160904"
"PHOENIX --  A night after playing one of their worst games of the season, the Washington Wizards responded with one of their best. Players credited coach Scott Brooks with an impromptu breakfast meeting that led to a 140-132 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. ""It's the first time he's done it all year,"" Washington guard Bradley Beal said. ""It was definitely needed for everybody. It was a point of emphasis on just winning games and what it takes to win games. ""He did a good job of teaching and breaking down what he expects from everyone. That's what we needed. We got a good result tonight."" Beal scored 35 points, Thomas Bryant added 23 and the Wizards held off a late Phoenix rally to win the second game of their four-game trip. Washington bounced back from a 13-point loss at Denver on Tuesday by shooting 57% from the field and making 19 of 35 3-pointers. ""You grow up day by day, 24 hours at a time,"" Brooks said. ""We always want to expedite that as fast as we can, but it's about growing each day."" Phoenix fell below .500 -- at 8-9 -- for the first time this season. Devin Booker led the Suns with 27 points and eight players scored in double figures, but they couldn't contain the Wizards on a consistent basis. ""I told our guys this is a major test for us, of our character, integrity and togetherness,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""About a week and a half ago everybody was excited and there was a buzz, and that's died down. Now we have to stand up and be good teammates and do all the stuff we talk about when we're in practice, and I believe we will."" Washington led 74-69 at halftime after both teams made just about everything they threw toward the basket. The Wizards' backups scored 43 of those 74, including 14 from Ish Smith, the former Suns guard who finished with 21. The Wizards scored 10 points in the first 1:33 of the third quarter to continue the onslaught and led 108-95 after three quarters. Phoenix cut it to 124-120 with about 3 minutes left before Beal made two free throws to stop the rally. Isaiah Thomas, another former Suns guard, made a 3-pointer on the next possession to push the advantage back to nine. The Suns have lost five of six games after starting the season with a surprising 7-4 record. ""We are not one of those teams that can just turn it on and finish a game,"" Booker said. ""We came close to it and cut it to four but if we do that work early we will be in a better position throughout the whole game."" Beal shot 11 of 18 from the field and added six assists. Bryant shot 9 of 11, including 2 of 2 from 3-point range. BIG BENCH Washington's bench had a productive night with 59 points. Smith led the way with 21 while Davis Bertans had 16 and Jordan McRae and Moritz Wagner both added 11. That group played a big chunk of the second quarter when the Wizards poured in 38 points. ""We pride ourselves on going out there and playing hard,"" McRae said. ""The second unit has to really move the ball and get after people defensively."" BRIGHT SPOT One encouraging development for the Suns is the improved play of forward Cheick Diallo, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes off the bench. He shot 7 of 8 from the field. With Deandre Ayton suspended and Aron Baynes hurt, Diallo been forced into a bigger role and responded. ""He's about the only guy we have right now that can catch the ball and try to finish with some intensity about the rim,"" Williams said. TIP-INS Wizards: Guard C.J. Miles hurt his left wrist in the loss to the Nuggets. Brooks said he won't play the rest of the road trip and the results of his MRI should be available soon. Suns: Ayton missed the 16th game of his 25-game suspension for violating the league's drug policy after testing positive for a diuretic. He'll be eligible to return against the Clippers on Dec. 17. ... Baynes missed the game with a right hip flexor strain.","401160905"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis shrugged off a constant cascade of boos and reminded a packed crowd exactly what it lost when the six-time All-Stars trade request was finally fulfilled. Davis capped a 41-point performance in his return to New Orleans by intercepting Jrue Holidays inbounds pass with 5 seconds left and making a pair of game-sealing free throws, and the Los Angeles Lakers extended their winning streak to nine with a 114-110 victory over the Pelicans on Wednesday night. Obviously, the emotions was high, Davis said. I think this game was circled on both calendars. And they came out guns blazing and we were able to come out with the win. An energetic crowd booed Davis during introductions and virtually every time he handled the ball, only to see him and new teammate LeBron James take over in the fourth quarter. James had 29 points and 11 assists, scoring 15 points in the final period, when Kyle Kuzma added nine of his 16 points to help the Lakers erase a 10-point deficit. My teammates kept telling me, AD, dont worry about it. Were going to get this win. Well find a way to win it for you, said Davis, who spent his first seven years in New Orleans. Kuzma gave the Lakers the lead for good when he hit a 3-pointer from the left corner with 1:07 to go, making it 111-109. New Orleans trimmed it to 111-110 when Josh Hart hit one of two free throws, and after a turnover by James as he was swarmed in the paint, JJ Redicks open 3 for the lead rimmed out. The Pelicans were forced to foul Davis, who missed one of two free throws, giving the Pelicans 5 seconds to run a play for the tie or lead. But thats when Davis sealed it, stepping in front of Brandon Ingram for his third steal. We were going to try to run JJ off a screen and back off, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. If not, we were going to try to get the ball to Brandon to try and dribble and create something. AD just made a great defensive play. Holiday had 29 points and 12 assists, and Ingram had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who have lost three straight. It was a great atmosphere. I thought the energy was our way, Holiday said. Toward the end of the game we had some execution issues, but we still gave ourselves a chance. After trailing by 16 in the third quarter, the Lakers seized momentum with a 9-0 run to open the fourth, trimming New Orleans lead to 89-88. Los Angeles tied the game at 91 on Kuzmas third 3. New Orleans briefly went back up by four before Davis, whod received treatment after banging his right elbow at the end of the third quarter, returned to the game and threw down an alley-oop feed from James. Any time you go back to a place where youve made a mark, where you started your career ... and gave a lot to the community and the franchise, you want to come back and play well and win, James said. We knew that as his brothers and we wanted to try and fulfill that goal. The Lakers took their first lead since the opening five minutes of the game when James hit a jumper over Ingram, pulling up as the Pelicans forward glanced over his shoulder to see if a screen was being set. Its just winning time for me, James said. Fourth quarter, no matter how much of a deficit were in, or however the game is going, I believe once I start the fourth I can make a push and see what happens. Davis missed his first shot and three of his first four to the delight of the crowd, but still scored 27 points by halftime on his way to the most points by a player in his first game against his former team, according to Elias. It was a tough environment. Every time he touched the basketball, he was going against a guy -- a bunch of guys -- that know him, playing against a coach that knows him, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. He put all that stuff aside. Blocked out the noise and rose to the challenge. Davis executed about every move New Orleans fans knew and loved when he wore the No. 23 in blue, red and gold, from soaring alley-oop dunks to turnaround baseline fades. Only this time, he wore a gold jersey with a purple No. 3, and it was his misses that drew roars from the crowd. The Pelicans appeared buoyed by the partisan energy permeating the arena, going up 38-25 on Holidays step-back 3 as the first quarter expired. New Orleans led 64-54 at halftime, thanks in large part to Holidays 10-of-15 shooting to that point, including his 4-of-4 mark from 3-point range. And the Pelicans maintained a double-digit lead until early in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: Shot 8 of 24 from 3-point range and missed seven of 25 free throws. ... Scored 62 points in the paint. ... Dwight Howard had nine points on four dunks and a free throw. Pelicans: Turned the ball over 20 times, leading to 19 Lakers points. ... Shot 17 of 40 (42.5%) from 3-point range. ... Redick made five 3s and finished with 18 points. ... Kenrich Williams scored 11 points. CATCHING UP Before Davis changed out of his uniform, he went to the Pelicans locker room to give Holiday a signed jersey and wound up lingering a bit to catch up with old teammates and coaches. Weve got a bond off the floor that will continue no matter the circumstances. It was a fun night, Davis said. Everybody thinks Ive got a vendetta against New Orleans or something like that. ... I have no ill will toward anybody. Im in a happy place. Theyre in a happy place. And were just here to play basketball.","401160906"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Carmelo Anthony is feeling more at home with the Portland Trail Blazers, especially now that hes seen the appreciation of the hometown fans. With the crowd chanting his name, Anthony finished with 19 points in his Moda Center home debut Wednesday night and the Blazers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 136-119. Damian Lillard had 27 points and Hassan Whiteside added 21 points and 16 rebounds for the Blazers, who led by as many as 35 points in their return home after an extended 2-4 road trip. Anthonys dunk early in the fourth quarter gave Portland a 111-79 lead and put the crowd on its feet. When he was subbed out for the last time a couple of minutes later, fans chanted Melo! Melo! The reception isnt the only thing making Anthony feel at home. He seems to be more comfortable with his new team, too. I think guys are just starting to feel a little bit more relaxed and at ease, Anthony said. When I first got here last week, and met those guys in New Orleans, I think it was the hype of the excitement of me coming to the team, guys not really knowing how this was going play out, how this was going to fit in, how I was going to fit in. The Blazers signed Anthony in hopes he could help the team overcome a slow start after going to the Western Conference finals last season. The deal was official Nov. 19, in the midst of Portlands six-game road trip. The 10-time All-Star played in four games before the team returned to Portland, averaging 16 points and nearly 30 minutes per game. He led the Blazers with 25 points in a 117-94 victory at Chicago on Monday night that snapped a four-game losing streak. Before signing with the Blazers, Anthony hadnt played since a 10-game stint with the Houston Rockets ended a little more than a year ago. Honestly, I didnt know what to expect, Anthony said. I wanted to come in, just play basketball and find my joy again, and the excitement of playing basketball, what it should be. Ive found that early on so far. Ive found that happiness, that joy, in the way the guys were able to open this up to me with open arms and bring me in here as one of their own. Abdel Nader had 23 points off the bench for Oklahoma City, and Chris Paul finished with 16 points. Melo's tough. Especially on that mid post where hes built a career, Paul said. Hes one of the best to ever play right there so I love defending him. That's my brother right there. We went to dinner last night. I always want to see him do well, except against us. The Thunder were coming off their first road win of the season, a 100-97 victory over Golden State on Monday night that snapped a three-game losing streak. Portland raced to a 40-17 lead and it wasnt close the rest of the way. The Blazers made their first six attempts from the perimeter and finished with 14 3s. Lillard led the team with five 3-pointers. The Blazers led 63-50 at the half. It ended on a contentious note when it appeared that Steven Adams hooked Lillard by the neck but wasnt called for the foul. Lillard complained to the ref, but Anthony spirited him away and toward the tunnel. Whiteside had 19 points and 12 rebounds at the break. There was more of the same in the third quarter, with the Blazers maintaining a double-digit lead. Portland went into the fourth quarter up 104-77. TIP INS Thunder: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander announced on Twitter that he has committed to play for team Canada in its bid to get to the Tokyo Olympics next year. ... Guard Hamidou Diallo missed his second game with a hyperextension sprain in his right elbow. He is expected to be out from four to six weeks. Trail Blazers: Gary Trent Jr. was held out of the game because of a hamstring injury. ... The Blazers 42 first-quarter points were a season high. ... Rodney Hood made all four shots he took from the field in the first half, including three 3-pointers. ... All of Portlands starters finished in double figures. HOME COOKIN The Blazers will play nine of their next 12 games at home, which the team was embracing after playing 13 of the first 18 on the road. We just didnt play good enough to win a lot of those games. But knowing that were coming home and that were playing better, I think its on everybodys mind like, `OK, its a great opportunity for us to kind of get ourselves back into it taking care of our home floor. Lillard said. Even though we havent been great at home, at some point it has to turn because our work has continued, weve been positive, and we continue to believe in ourselves, so I think were starting to turn that corner.","401160907"
"Draymond Green jokes about coach Steve Kerr bloodying his hand by breaking a clipboard but says it clearly turned the team's play around. (0:39) SAN FRANCISCO --  Another healthy body sure helped the Golden State Warriors, especially when that guy coming back was Draymond Green -- an emotional, vocal leader of this young group who brings it on both ends. Eric Paschall scored 25 points and the Warriors emphatically closed out a tight game after their failure two days earlier, holding off the Chicago Bulls 104-90 on Wednesday night for just their second win at new Chase Center. ""Having Draymond back was a big deal. He settled us down,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Having nine instead of eight, it matters. You just have more to work with and more options."" The latest injury news for the Warriors involved their coach. Kerr cut his right hand breaking a clipboard. It happens at least once a season. ""It's a mere flesh wound. I broke a clipboard. It's one of two. I'm allotted two a year. This was No. 1,"" Kerr said. ""It always cuts in the same place. This was a little deeper one, I was a little more upset. I'm day to day. No stitches yet but we'll see tomorrow."" Blood on the clipboard told players their coach was hurt. ""He's writing a play up and he's actively wiping blood up off the clipboard,"" Omari Spellman said. Alec Burks added 23 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in just the second win in 12 games for Golden State, which squandered a late lead Monday night in losing 100-97 to Oklahoma City while allowing the Thunder to score the game's final 13 points. The Warriors snapped a three-game losing streak. Green returned from a three-game absence because of a sore right heel and contributed seven points, eight assists and five rebounds in nearly 24 minutes. Zach LaVine had 36 points, five rebounds and five assists for the Bulls, who now will try to avenge a 117-94 home loss to the Trail Blazers on Monday night when they travel to Portland to play Friday. Golden State struggled to take care of the ball or make stops down the stretch against Oklahoma City, then worked to be the aggressor in this game. The Warriors jumped in the passing lanes on defense to create transition baskets and plays like Paschall's timely dunk that put his team ahead 88-83 with 5:17 remaining. The Bulls shot 16 for 44 in the first half to trail 53-48 at the break. Spellman wound up with 13 points, 11 rebounds and three blocked shots off the bench for his fifth career double-double and first with the Warriors. ""I'm just happy to bring the energy for this team,"" he said. Bulls forward Chandler Hutchison, sidelined for two games last week with soreness in his shins, was in the starting lineup but played only two minutes, not a great sign one game after he came back to score six points and grab three rebounds in seven minutes late in the loss to Portland. TIP-INS Bulls: F Luke Kornet played 10 minutes in his return from an eight-game absence following sinus surgery. ... G Ryan Arcidiacono played after he was a game-time decision with a sprained right elbow. ... The Bulls are now 1-1 on the road vs. the Western Conference. ... G Otto Porter Jr. missed his 10th consecutive game with a bone bruise in his left foot. ... Chicago has been swept in the past two season series vs. Golden State.

The Warriors are 2-7 at home. SIDELINE KLAY Klay Thompson is sidelined recovering from knee surgery and got to work the sideline. The Splash Brother served as a sideline reporter in the second quarter from a table off the end of Golden State's bench, a new gig for the All-Star guard. General manager Bob Myers, using the foam roller on a mat in the weight room, inquired to Thompson when he entered the locker room. ""Hey Klay, you ready for sideline tonight?"" Thompson: ""Yeah, I'm dropping knowledge."" Before his stint began, he took time to sign a quick autograph, then sat down and settled in as if in his element -- sporting a big grin. He even spontaneously took over some of the postgame work interviewing Spellman, who said, ""Klay's hilarious, it was hard not to laugh."" Thompson had surgery July 2 for a torn ACL in his left knee that he injured in Game 6 of the NBA Finals, when the Toronto Raptors won to clinch the franchise's first championship. 3-POINT STAT The Warriors went 11 for 29 from 3-point range to the Bulls' 10 of 29. QUOTEABLE Bulls coach Jim Boylen on the Warriors: ""The names maybe have changed but their spirit, their soul and the way they play, the way they compete I don't think has changed at all. So give them a lot of credit for that.""","401160908"
"NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving is getting closer to a return, and at some point he will face his former team. When he does, the Brooklyn Nets can only hope he plays as well as Spencer Dinwiddie. Dinwiddie had 32 points and 11 assists while Irving remained sidelined, and the Nets beat the Boston Celtics 112-107 on Friday to split a home-and-home series. Irving missed his eighth straight game with a right shoulder injury but was at the arena to get an evaluation and watch from the bench along with Kevin Durant. Coach Kenny Atkinson said afterward that the All-Star point guard has started work on the court and would miss one more game before potentially being ready to rejoin a team that has done well in his absence thanks to Dinwiddie's strong performances. ""When Kyrie comes back I think that's just going to give us a team with more depth, a more powerful team. But listen, he's playing as good as anybody in the NBA right now in my humble opinion,"" Atkinson said of Dinwiddie. The Eastern Conference player of the week last week matched his highest assist total of the season and was two shy of his best scoring performance of the season. ""The role's completely different so obviously there's a change there,"" Dinwiddie said. ""My approach to the game is very similar either way, so whatever the team needs to win and then the role kind of dictates what that is."" Jarrett Allen added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets, who bounced back from their 121-110 loss in Boston on Wednesday to win for the fifth time in six games. Jayson Tatum had 26 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who had won two straight. Kemba Walker finished with 17 points and six assists, but the Nets handled Irving's replacement much better this time after he scored a season-high 39 points Wednesday. Boston coach Brad Stevens talked about the importance of a strong start with the early tip, but the Celtics couldn't deliver it. They were called for a double dribble and a 3-second violation during a six-turnover first quarter, when the Nets opened a 14-point lead. Boston was much sharper in the second, with Tatum making four 3-pointers, including one that cut it to 58-55 at halftime. The Nets extended it back to 14 in the third when Dinwiddie hit his second straight 3-pointer, but Boston got it back down to 87-81 by the end of the period. Again, Brooklyn pushed it back to double digits in the fourth and held on after Boston cut it to four in the final minute. ""It was too late,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""We tried to turn it on too late and it burned us in the end."" TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum was 4 for 8 from 3-point range after going 0 for 11 in his previous three games. ... Marcus Smart scored 15 points. ... The Celtics will remain in New York before visiting the Knicks on Sunday. Nets: DeAndre Jordan had eight points and 11 rebounds after missing two games with left ankle soreness. ... Taurean Prince scored 16 points. ... The Nets finished 9-6 this month, their first winning November since going 11-4 in 2012, their first full month in Brooklyn. MORE ON KYRIE Two days after Celtics fans taunted Irving even in his absence, and he responded with a long Instagram post saying sports and entertainment were ""ignorant and obtrusive."", a group of Nets fans chanted ""Kyrie's better! Kyrie's better!"" when Walker shot free throws. None of the anger in Boston toward Irving is coming from Stevens. ""I like Kyrie, I appreciated Kyrie, wished him well and I think that him coming home has been something that he wanted to do and he was a free agent,"" Stevens said. ""You get to make that choice and we can't do anything but respect that and be happy for him."" NEW LOOK The Nets debuted their uniforms in tribute to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of the borough that was home to The Notorious B.I.G. The white uniforms say Bed-Stuy across the front, with a camouflage pattern along the sides of the jerseys and shorts. The Nets plan to wear them 28 times this season.","401160909"
"DETROIT --  Langston Galloways shot from around midcourt sailed toward the basket, representing Detroits last hope to force overtime in another tight game against Charlotte. It looked good, Hornets coach James Borrego said. It looked good, but I think we played the play the right way. We did all we could. Galloways shot rimmed out at the buzzer, and Charlotte held on for a 110-107 victory over the Pistons on Friday night. The Hornets completed a home-and-home sweep of Detroit this week. The Pistons must be wondering what they have to do to beat the Hornets. Charlotte edged the Pistons 109-106 earlier in the month and 102-101 on Wednesday night. The Hornets have won nine straight over Detroit. I dont really buy into streaks like that, I guess, Charlotte forward Marvin Williams said. The NBA, its difficult to win a game. Sometimes youll play against a team thats just kind of a little different matchup for you. The Hornets rallied from an eight-point deficit in the final quarter and led by three with 8.9 seconds left. Detroit inbounded the ball, and Luke Kennard missed a 3-pointer from near the top of the key. Galloway was able to run down the loose ball, and his last-ditch shot looked on line, but it wouldnt go in. We are putting ourselves in position to win, we just have to get thought in the game, and execution in the fourth quarter and down the stretch, Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. P.J. Washington scored 26 points for Charlotte, and Terry Rozier added 23. The Hornets were without center Cody Zeller because of a left hip injury. Derrick Rose led the Pistons with 23 points. With the score tied at 95, Galloway got a very friendly bounce off the rim when he sank a 3-pointer while being fouled. That four-point play started an 8-0 run, but Charlotte rallied. Devonte Graham put the Hornets up 108-106 with a 3-pointer -- the Hornets went 19 of 38 from beyond the arc. Blake Griffin had a chance to tie it with 1:29 remaining, but he made just one of two free throws, and the Pistons didnt score again. Detroit finished 10 of 20 from the line. NEXT MAN UP In Zellers absence, Bismack Biyombo has started the last two games for Charlotte. He had 19 points and nine rebounds Wednesday, then contributed 13 points and nine rebounds Friday. He ignites our defense. He makes us better on that end of the floor, Borrego said. Our commitment to protecting the paint, keeping the ball in front -- and hes given us a tremendous amount offensively as well. His ability to run the floor, play with pace, rolling to the bucket, finishing big shots around the rim, tipping balls out, offensive rebounding. STRONG START Rozier made his first five 3-point attempts and scored 17 points in the first half. Kennard helped the Pistons mostly keep pace, making four 3s of his own in the first quarter. The teams combined to make 21 3-pointers in the first half, the most in a first half in any NBA game this season. The Hornets led 62-57. I thought we started off bad defensively, Kennard said. We started out and had thirty-something points in the first quarter and we were still losing at the end of the first. So, weve got to figure something out. TIP-INS Hornets: Miles Bridges scored 16 points in front of a crowd that included Tom Izzo, his coach at Michigan State. Pistons: The Pistons were without G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction). ... Detroit was called for its second delay of game violation at the start of the second half, so the third quarter began with a technical foul free throw for Charlotte, which Rozier made.","401160910"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Toronto Raptors weren't getting shots to fall. So they concentrated on defense and waited for somebody to get hot. Norman Powell delivered in the third quarter, scoring 19 of his career-best 33 points and the Raptors won their sixth straight game, beating the Orlando Magic 90-83 on Friday night. ""Sometimes a guy just finds a groove in the middle of the game when nobody else has any flow going,"" said Fred Van Fleet, who added 22 points for the Raptors. ""So you want to ride that out as long as you can. Norm took over the offense by himself."" Powell was 7-for-9 shooting in the third quarter, including three 3-pointers. He said he was just reacting to the Raptors' seven-point halftime deficit, the result of 31% shooting that included 5 of 24 from 3-point range. ""You stay in the moment and let plays come to you, continue to shoot and live with the result,"" Powell said. ""Everybody is being really tied into what we are doing (defensively), how we are changing defenses, where we need to be, helping one another, talking, communicating, coming out of timeouts. When we see where an adjustment needs to be made, we were able to pick it up in the second half."" The Raptors won despite 4-for-22 shooting by Pascal Siakam, the NBA's ninth-leading scorer. Siakam finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 19 points for Orlando, which has lost four of five. Markelle Fultz added 15 points. Aaron Gordon, who played 32 minutes for Orlando after missing three games with a right ankle contusion, had eight points and eight rebounds. The Magic shot 35% for the game and had 24 turnovers. ""You're just not going to beat a team that good turning the ball over that much,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""They help early, they're great with their hands, you take the extra dribble and it's gone. The majority of (the turnovers) were that."" The Magic led by 11 twice in the first half. Van Fleet hit a pair of 3-pointers that helped the Raptors cut Orlando's lead to 47-40 by halftime. But he second half was all Toronto, and especially Powell. ""We had a stretch of 12 consecutive stops in the third quarter,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""That's about as high as it gets. It was excellent. We didn't shoot the ball well, we didn't play well. I was happy when we got to the locker room only down seven."" Powell scored Toronto's first 10 points in the second half, eight as part of a 13-0 run that gave the Raptors a 60-53 lead late in the third quarter. Powell's final 3-pointer gave Toronto an 83-72 lead, their largest of the game, with less than three minutes left.

"CLEVELAND -- Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 11 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and the Milwaukee Bucks held off the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-110 on Friday night for their 10th consecutive victory. Cleveland trailed 74-52 early in the third quarter, but hit 10 3-pointers in the period and cut the lead into single figures. The Cavaliers continued to rally and Kevin Love's layup made it 113-110 with 2 minutes, 20 seconds left -- Cleveland's final points of the game. Khris Middleton's jumper and two free throws by George Hill put the game away, but Antetokounmpo was once again the difference-maker. The reigning MVP scored in a variety of ways with the game on the line, including a 3-pointer, a floating jumper, a tip-in and a dunk off an offensive rebound. Cleveland got back in it with Antetokounmpo taking a rest in the third quarter. The Cavaliers had 42 points, their highest-scoring quarter of the season. Antetokounmpo grabbed 12 rebounds and has had double-doubles in every game this season for Milwaukee, at 16-3 the top team in the Eastern Conference. The Bucks hadn't won 10 in a row since the 1985-86 season. Hill scored 18 points and Middleton, playing for the second time since missing seven games with a bruised left thigh, had 12. Cleveland has dropped nine of 10. Rookie Darius Garland scored 21 points, including five 3-pointers, and Cedi Osman had 20. Tristan Thompson had 11 points and 13 rebounds, including the 5,000th of his career in the first half. Love, who is playing despite dealing with a sore back, had 16 points and 8 rebounds in 31 minutes. Antetokounmpo was 14-of-26 from the field and took charge after Milwaukee won the opening tip. He cut to the basket, took a bounce pass from Eric Bledsoe, dunked with his right hand over Love and completed the three-point play at the foul line. Antetokounmpo's dunk came just 13 seconds into the game. Love, who came over to help after Antetokounmpo evaded his defender, leaped to block the attempt but was whistled for the foul. Love missed games Saturday and Monday, and was limited to 24 minutes Wednesday. TIP-INS Bucks: The record for most consecutive double-doubles to start an NBA season is 34, set by Bill Walton in 1977. ... Hill (sore back) returned after missing two games.

"NEW YORK --  Philadelphia coach Brett Brown made a case for why Ben Simmons should be considered for a spot on the NBAs All-Defensive team before Fridays game in New York. Simmons went out and backed Browns talk with a pair of steals in the second half, including a game-clinching play down the stretch for the short-handed 76ers. Joel Embiid had 27 points and 17 rebounds, James Ennis III scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half, and Philadelphia overcame a sluggish start and beat the Knicks 101-95. The league better pay attention to him defensively, Brown said of Simmons. How can he not be discussed amongst the leagues better defensive players? He guards five men, point guards, twos and threes. Hes kind of a Swizz army knife in that regard. Tobias Harris scored 19, and Simmons chipped in 16 points for the 76ers, who have won two straight and six of seven. Julius Randle had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Marcus Morris Sr. scored 20 points for the Knicks, who have lost a season-high five straight. The Knicks, who have lost their two meetings this season against the 76ers, went 19 for 33 from the free-throw line. At the end of the day, youve got a guy like Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons out there, thats why they make the big bucks, New York coach David Fizdale said. Those guys are closers. You just cant miss 14 free throws against a team like that. The 76ers were playing without starters Al Horford (rest) and Josh Richardson (right hamstring injury) and it showed in the first half as their offense struggled. Philadelphia shot 13 for 38 from the field, including 2 for 18 behind the 3-point line. But the Sixers rallied from a 51-39 halftime deficit, cutting the lead to 56-52 with 8:03 to play in the third quarter when Simmons intercepted Julius Randles inbound pass off a time out and raced down the court for a dunk. Philadelphia then outscored the Knicks 16-11 over the final seven minutes of the third quarter for a 70-68 lead entering the final quarter. The Knicks offense sputtered, going 0 for 9 with two turnovers down the stretch in the third. Philadelphia went on a 9-3 run, capped by former Knick Trey Burkes basket that made it 79-73. Harris increased the 76ers' lead 94-89 with 1:19 left in regulation, forcing a Knicks timeout. Simmons, who entered play second behind former teammate Jimmy Butler with 2.25 steals per game, picked off an inbound pass from Frank Ntilikina and dunked to extend the lead 96-89 and hold off the Knicks. Finding their offensive rhythm, Simmons said, would allow their offense to be on par with their defensive effort and avoid future starts like the one they encountered at Madison Square Garden against one of the leagues worst teams. We got to know what we are good at, what we are great at, and whats working us, he said. With this team, moving the ball, posting up, slashing, cutting and finding guys on the perimeter is what works. The Knicks jumped out to a 23-9 lead on consecutive baskets from Barrett in the opening period. A 3-pointer from reserve Damyean Dotson made it 31-18 to close out the first. New York led by as many as 16 points in the second after Philadelphia coach Brett Brown picked up a technical foul after question a foul call on Simmons. Marcus Morris Sr. hit the technical free throw and Randle was perfect on his two free throws, extending an 8-0 run to make it 51-35. TIPS INS: 76ers: C/F Horford was held out due to rest. ... G Richardson did not play because of tightness in his right hamstring. Knicks: RJ Barrett had 18 points. NEXT MAN UP: Missing Richardsons 16.1 points and Horfords 14.4 points meant Brown had to reach into his bench to make up the difference and backup forward Ennis III certainly did not disappoint. Ennis III went 3 for 4 from the 3-point line and was perfect on his nine free throws over 22 minutes after totaling just 24 minutes in his last two games. His play was key late in the third quarter as the 76ers rallied. He contributed eight points during a 9-2 run to close out the period. I mean in this whole locker room he has a respect level with the way that he plays and how hard he plays and tonight it was coming to fruition in a high-volume way, Harris said. But we dont come out of here with this win today without him, his effort.","401160913"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- When the Indiana Pacers finally asserted themselves after a sluggish half, the Atlanta Hawks' Trae Young continually made shots to remind Indy that nothing would be easy. Young tied a career high with 49 points, but the host Pacers overcame an 11-point halftime deficit as well as being pushed an extra five minutes for a 105-104 overtime triumph over the Hawks on Friday night. T.J. Warren hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:13 remaining for the Pacers, and Jeremy Lamb had 20 points and sparked a quick start in overtime with a 20-foot jumper and an assist on a Myles Turner 3-pointer. ""It was just a little adversity,"" Turner said. ""I feel like we faced it well."" But back came the Hawks, trying to avoid a ninth consecutive loss, as Young scored eight of his team's 10 points in overtime, including a pair of 3-pointers. ""I guess it was good individually,"" Young said, ""but people who know me know I don't care at all. If we don't win, none of that matters. I didn't do enough."" Young's 49 points tied for the fourth-highest, single-game total in Bankers Life Fieldhouse history. He finished 16 of 28 from the floor, hitting 8 of 15 on 3-pointers. ""The head of the snake, Trae Young, he was great tonight,"" Lamb said. ""He was great, but we were able to get enough stops."" Warren's only 3-pointer broke a 99-all tie. He finished with 16 points. ""We just kept grinding and finally got the lead late,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""They found a way to get this game."" After two quarters, McMillan was scratching his head with the Pacers trailing 54-43. ""I was thinking it was too much turkey,"" he said. ""We looked asleep in the first half."" Turner, who along with Domantas Sabonis scored 17 points, sensed his team would respond based on how they've played recently. ""These past couple of games, we've started to come together a lot more,"" he said. ""We came back and responded well."" Warren and Malcomb Brogdon had 16. Brogdon had a chance to win the game in regulation but his last-second bank shot was long. The Hawks' DeAndre' Bembry and Alex Len added 15 points apiece off the bench. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce wishes his team had the balance of the Pacers. Aside from Young, the rest of the Hawks shot just 35.6 percent (23 of 63). ""We needed every bit of (Young's), whatever number, 49, 48, whatever he ended up with, we needed every bit of that,"" Pierce said. ""However, we've got to balance that. We were playing him heavy minutes.""

"MIAMI --  A big lead had almost entirely slipped away, and the Miami Heat showed no sense of panic. With good reason. A 27-8 third-quarter run allowed the Heat to pull away and beat the Golden State Warriors 122-105 on Friday night. Goran Dragic scored 20 points, Tyler Herro added 19 and the Heat remained perfect at home -- 8-0, tying the franchise's best home start to a season. ""Being able to weather the storm is big,"" Herro said. ""It's a game of runs."" Duncan Robinson scored 17 for Miami. Robinson and Herro were a combined 10 for 13 from 3-point range. Jimmy Butler scored 16, while Kendrick Nunn -- who was with the Warriors' G League team last year -- and Kelly Olynyk each had 15 for the Heat. ""We're trying to build a consistent game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Jordan Poole scored 20 for injury-ravaged Golden State, which was playing the opener of a five-game road trip. Eric Paschall scored 17 and Alec Burks finished with 16 for the Warriors. The Warriors are one of four teams without back-to-back wins this season, joining Chicago, Detroit and New York. They were down 20 after the first quarter, then clawed within 13 by halftime and eventually as little as six midway through the third quarter -- before Miami recovered to put the game away with the 27-8 run over an eight-minute stretch. Draymond Green played only 19 minutes for Golden State, and Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he'll be on a minutes restriction going forward. The Warriors' injury woes -- no Stephen Curry, no Klay Thompson, no D'Angelo Russell and more -- have left them an NBA-worst 4-16. ""We're obviously playing for the future, playing for next year and he needs to be out on the floor to help guide these young players,"" Kerr said. ""I know he wants to be out on the floor. So we've got to find the balance between allowing him to make his impact with this team and not wearing him down at the same time."" Miami's lead was 82-75 after Poole made a pair of free throws with 4:37 left in the third. That's when the Heat took off, Herro connecting on a 30-footer to end the big run and give Miami a 109-83 lead with 8:40 left. It was the third home game this season that Miami has won without trailing. Opponents have led for 29:54 of a possible 384 minutes on the Heat home floor -- just 7.8% of the time. The Heat have led for 339 of those minutes. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State lost the first quarter 41-21 and has been outscored by 20 or more points in the opening period three times in its last 17 games. Before that, it happened three times in a span of 1,102 Warriors' regular-season contests. ... Kevon Looney (neuropathy) missed his 19th consecutive game, but the Warriors hope to have him back as early as Monday's game in Atlanta. Heat: Miami has led by at least 15 points in all eight of its home games -- and didn't take long to extend that streak Friday, opening the game on a 21-6 run. ... This was the 10th and final game of Dion Waiters' suspension for conduct detrimental to the team, but the Heat have not revealed what's next. A conditioning period seems possible, and it's unclear if Waiters will fly with the team Saturday to start a three-game trip. ONLY TWO Of the 10 players on the court last season when Dwyane Wade made a desperation 3-pointer with no time left to beat the Warriors, only two played Friday. For the Warriors, Kevin Durant is in Brooklyn, Andre Iguodala is technically with Memphis, Jordan Bell is with Minnesota, and Curry and Thompson are injured. For the Heat, Waiters is suspended, Josh Richardson is with Philadelphia and Wade is retired. That leaves Kelly Olynyk and Justise Winslow, who played off Miami's bench. 70, AGAIN Miami had 71 points in the first half, making this the first month in team history with three games at least 70 by intermission. The others: a franchise-record-tying 75 against Cleveland on Nov. 20, and 71 against Houston on Nov. 3.","401160915"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Utah coach Quin Snyder didnt have a lot to say to his team at halftime, despite a 15-point deficit. A little video session, but no harsh words or motivational speeches. The low-key tactic worked well. The Jazz came out quickly in the third, eventually erased the Memphis Grizzlies double-digit lead and pulled away for a 103-94 victory Friday night to snap a two-game skid. Bojan Bogdanovic was key in the fourth quarter, scoring 16 of his 33 points in the game. Im glad we played the second half like we did, opposed to the first, Snyder said. We came out competitive and threw ourselves into the defense. We were struggling offensively in the first half and forgot about that and the offense came. Bogdanovic matched his season-high scoring mark, going 12 of 20 from the field, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range. Donovan Mitchell added 20 points despite a tough shooting night (7 of 22) and Rudy Gobert had 13 points, 13 rebounds and a pair of blocks. In the fourth, when the Jazz would routinely look to Mitchell, their leading scorer, they relied on Bogdanovic. It shows how unselfish we are, especially Donovan, Bogdanovic said. Our best player, hes supposed to take last shots in the last couple of minutes. ... He told me to take the last shots. Mitchell added that when it gets to a point, (Bogdanovic) locks in and knocks shots down. Its easy to just kind of run plays and give him the ball as much as possible. Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting. The Grizzlies have lost six straight. Memphis saw a 15-point halftime lead evaporate quickly as the Jazz scored the first 12 points of the third quarter, the Grizzlies going almost four minutes without scoring against a much more active Jazz defense. The run would reach 18-2, allowing Utah to retake the lead. The game would level into a tight contest the rest of the third. We didnt do what we need to do in the third quarter because we let them come out and punch us early, and we didnt respond, Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. said. Memphis would still be close near the midway point of the fourth, but couldnt keep pace with Bogdanovic and the rest of the Jazz. We have to play all four quarters like we did the first half, said rookie guard Ja Morant, who was limited to 11 points making only four of his 13 shots. It helped us get out to our biggest lead. We just have to do that all four quarters. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell had scored at least 25 points in six of his previous eight games before recording 20 against Memphis. ... F Ed Davis, who missed the previous 12 games with a left fibula fracture, played for the first time since Nov. 3, grabbing five rebounds despite not scoring. Bogdanovic also had 33 points on Nov. 8 against Milwaukee. Grizzlies: Valanciunas recorded his 11th double-double and his third straight. ... Memphis, which led by 15 in the game, blew a double-digit lead for the sixth time this season, most in the NBA, and the 15-point lead was the largest blown by Memphis this season. The starting backcourt of Morant and Dillon Brooks managed only 11 points each, converting 9 of 27 shots. Jackson had four blocks in the game, the final one marking the 100th block in his first 75 NBA games. RETRO NIGHT Both teams wore their throwback jerseys -- the Jazz in the purple, snow-capped mountain version; Memphis in it teal-based ones with a large G and S in Grizzlies. The team logos from about 20 years ago were used on the scoreboard and the Grizzly head with the claws around the red ball was the center court emblem. CONLEY ON THE BOARDS Former Grizzlies guard Mike Conley has struggled in his shooting this season as he adapts to his new team, but his rebounding numbers are up. He had seven rebounds, including a pair off the offensive glass. I couldnt make a shot, so I had to do something, Conley said.","401160916"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder kept battling. Dennis Schroder scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and had seven assists to help the Thunder beat the New Orleans Pelicans 109-104 on Friday night. Abdel Nader scored 19 points and Danilo Gallinari had 17 for Oklahoma City, which had been 1-4 in its previous five games. Steven Adams added 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder, including the final four points in the last minute. After losing their first seven games decided by five points or less, the Thunder have won two in a row. ""I thought it was a really good team win, just because a lot of guys stepped up and contributed,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""We did a fairly good job of closing the game out. I thought top to bottom, everybody that was out there really contributed in a big way."" Brandon Ingram had 26 points and eight rebounds to lead New Orleans. J.J. Redick added 16 points for the Pelicans but missed two 3-point attempts in the final 11 seconds. New Orleans, which trailed by as much as 16 midway through the second quarter and by nine at halftime, had seven players score in double digits. ""We got back into the game simply because we were moving the basketball and moving ourselves,"" said New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry. ""We've just got to get to a point where we're doing it for 48 minutes, not 45 and not 47. We've got to do that all the way until the end of the game."" The Thunder led until midway through the third quarter when New Orleans jumped on top with a 13-1 run. After the Pelicans pushed their lead to a game-high eight points at 92-84 on E'Twaun Moore's 3-pointer with 9:53 remaining, the Thunder responded with a 13-1 run to regain the edge. The teams exchanged leads three times down the stretch until New Orleans went ahead 104-103 with 2:48 left on Ingram's layup, but the Thunder scored the next six points. Chris Paul sank a short jumper with 1:24 to go, then Adams knocked home a rebound with 53.7 seconds left and put it away with an authoritative dunk with 15.1 seconds on the clock. The Pelicans missed their last six shots of the game. ""The energy was amazing. It was just probably our best team win of the year,"" Paul said. ""The biggest thing is that we never gave up and we closed out the game on defense. And I think once we continue to figure out that our defense can win more games for us than our offense, we'll be fine."" TIP-INS New Orleans: Kenrich Williams left after rolling his left ankle midway through the first quarter. Williams went down on the play and stayed down for a couple of minutes before being helped off the court. ... Ingram scored 12 points in the first quarter, zero in the second, 10 in the third and four in the fourth. He has not scored fewer than 21 points over his last nine games, dating back to a seven-point effort the last time these teams met, a 115-104 Thunder victory on Nov. 2. Oklahoma City: Paul entered averaging 16.2 points per game, but had just seven, on 3-of-9 shooting, including the basket that gave the Thunder the lead for good with 1:24 to go. He also had six assists and five rebounds. It was the fourth time this season Paul scored in single digits. ... Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entered averaging 18.8 points per game, but had just two at halftime and ended up with 10 points, his lowest output of the season. ... Adams scored 10 points in the game's opening 2:16, then was blanked until his clutch buckets in the final minute. QUOTE OF THE NIGHT ""We had an opportunity to win it at the end,"" Gentry said. ""But we have to do a better job all together. Defensively, we had a few missed assignments at the end that cost us big. We've just got to be able to execute things at the end of the game defensively and offensively.""","401160917"
"SAN ANTONIO --  This trip looked a lot like Kawhi Leonards last game in San Antonio. LaMarcus Aldridge and Derrick White each had 17 points, and the Spurs beat Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers 107-97 on Friday night. They wanted it more and it showed tonight, Clippers guard Patrick Beverly said. Youve got to congratulate them. They came in here with an edge, with more of a thirst, and it showed. The Spurs stopped the Clippers seven-game win streak in Leonards second appearance in San Antonio as an opponent. Leonard finished with 19 points on 8-for-23 shooting. This wasnt just any old team, San Antonios DeMar DeRozan said. Its a high-caliber team in our conference. We went out there and compete, compete, compete and the outcome came out our way. San Antonio had lost two straight and 12 of 14, but it found its footing against Los Angeles and its former teammate. Leonard spent his first seven seasons in San Antonio before demanding a trade. He was shipped off to Toronto and won his second NBA Finals MVP last season before joining the Clippers as a free agent. Leonards initial return to San Antonio on Jan. 24 resulted in thunderous boos and a 125-107 loss for the Raptors. Fridays game had a similar feel. Uhm, didnt make nothing of it, Leonard said of the reception. Felt like a normal away game. It may have been routine for Leonard, but it was an exception for the Spurs (7-13) in their worst start in 23 seasons. Everybody, right down the line, everybody was aggressive, picking up the way we need to, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. We just need to do it more often and get more consistent. Leonard received a chorus of boos during pregame introductions and whenever he touched the ball. The level of vitriol increased throughout the game, especially with the Spurs having by far their best game of the season. Leonard missed his first three shots before collecting a steal at the free-throw line and sprinting down court for an uncontested dunk as the Clippers led by as many as eight points in the first quarter. Marco Belinelli helped the Spurs move in front, making a 3-pointer and a no-look pass to Trey Lyles for a 32-30 lead with 11 minutes remaining in the first half. We had a couple stretches tonight where we just put runs together, Spurs center Jakob Poeltl said. Really came out strong with energy on the defensive end. Then all of a sudden, the shots start falling and it really got us going. Poeltl, who was acquired by San Antonio in the Leonard deal, continued the momentum with four points and three blocks in a pivotal run in the second quarter, including two blocks on Leonard that drew deafening cheers. Whenever one guy hustles, makes a big play, that ignites us on the bench and on the floor and gets our crowd going, said DeRozan, who also came over in the Leonard trade. Patty Mills 3-pointer with 10:32 remaining gave the Spurs an 81-71 lead, prompting a timeout from the Clippers. The Spurs made five 3-pointers in the final quarter, going 14 for 36 from beyond the arc for the game. DeRozan had 15 points, and Poeltl had six points, six rebounds and four blocked shots. Paul George had a season-low five points on 2-for-11 shooting for the Clippers. INSULT TO INJURY Clippers coach Doc Rivers was locked out of the locker room after finishing his postgame press conference. Fitting, Rivers deadpanned. Thats the kind of night its been for us. KEEP SHOOTING Popovich has encouraged White to shoot 3-pointers even though he has struggled at times this season. White responded with a career-high five on 5-for-7 shooting from deep. I think Im going to take like 20 next game, White said. Just try to get the looks that I get, let it fly, shoot with confidence. TIP-INS Clippers: Landry Shamet missed his 10th straight game with a sprained left ankle. Shamet, who has started all 10 games he has played, is averaging 9.1 points in 29.4 minutes. Spurs: The Spurs played their 700th game at the AT&amp;T Center since it opened in 2002. They have the most wins at home of any team during that span with 564 victories.","401160918"
"PHOENIX -- Luka Doncic was in total control, getting into the lane when he wanted, getting the shots he wanted and getting the ball to teammates in places where they could do some damage. Because of that, the Dallas Mavericks got the result they wanted with an 120-113 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. Doncic tied a career high with 42 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added 26 and the Mavericks bounced back from a disappointing loss to the LA Clippers three days earlier. ""Great players have a short memory for tough games,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said about Doncic's big night. ""They move forward. They're always thinking ahead and about the next challenge. He was spectacular tonight from start to finish."" The second-year guard just missed a triple-double with 11 assists and nine rebounds. Hardaway shot 6-of-9 from 3-point range to help offset a quiet night from Kristaps Porzingis, who finished with two points. The teams entered the final quarter tied at 89. The Mavericks went on an 8-0 run midway through the fourth to take a 104-97 lead and never trailed again. Doncic was coming off a subpar outing Tuesday night in a loss to the Clippers, where he shot 4-of-14 from the field and missed all eight 3-point attempts. The 20-year-old was superb in Phoenix, making 12 of 24 shots from the field and 15 of 18 free throws. He said he didn't get too low after the Clippers loss and was no more motivated than normal Friday, even if his performance suggested he had a little extra fire. ""It's just one game -- we lost one game,"" Doncic said. ""We shouldn't be worried about that. You go to the next game and pretend like nothing happened. I'm anxious to go out there every night. I'm excited about every game. That's me."" Phoenix has lost six of its past seven games. Kelly Oubre Jr. led the Suns with 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Ricky Rubio added 21 points and nine assists. ""We didn't play our game the last quarter,"" Rubio said. ""I think we got focused on the wrong things, things we can't control."" Doncic had 14 points, six rebounds and six assists in the first quarter as the Mavericks edged to a 53-50 halftime lead. Oubre had 13 for the Suns. EMOTIONAL SUNS Friday's game was entertaining and a little emotional, with a handful of moments where Suns and Mavericks players had to be separated. Phoenix coach Monty Williams said his team struggled with composure. ""Both teams were pretty emotional tonight,"" Williams said. ""But I just felt like it affected us more."" HARDAWAY'S BIG NIGHT Carlisle recently moved Hardaway into the starting lineup and the 6-foot-5 guard has responded with a string of big games. Over the past two weeks, he's had 16 points against Cleveland, 31 against Houston and now 26 against the Suns. ""It's seizing the opportunity and being prepared,"" Hardaway said. A FREE THROW ADVENTURE Suns forward Frank Kaminsky inadvertently contributed to a rally with two of the worst free throws of his professional career. Kaminsky -- a respectable 76% career free throw shooter -- had a stunning air ball on his first of two free throws during the third quarter. He overcompensated on the second, pounding it off the backboard and rim before getting his own offensive rebound. The extra possession led to a huge dunk by Devin Booker to put the Suns up 69-63. TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis and Phoenix's Aron Baynes both received technical fouls in the second quarter when they got into an argument coming off the court during a timeout. ... Doncic averaged a 30-point triple-double in November, becoming just the third NBA player to accomplish that feat in a calendar month, joining Oscar Robertson (five times) and Russell Westbrook (twice). ... The Mavericks improved to 12-6 for their best start since the 2010-11 season, when they won an NBA title. ... Porzingis missed all eight shots he took from the field, including six 3-pointers. Suns: Baynes returned to the lineup after a five-game absence because of a right hip flexor sprain. He finished with 17 points and seven rebounds in 25 minutes. ... Phoenix fell to 8-10.","401160919"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Carmelo Anthony can't recall another a 10-block game like Trail Blazers teammate Hassan Whiteside had against the Bulls. Anthony had 23 points and 11 rebounds and the Blazers downed Chicago 107-103 on Friday night for their second victory over the Bulls this week. But Whiteside stole the show with 8 points, 15 rebounds and a franchise-record 10 blocks for Portland. ""Never seen that before, and I've played with some great shot-blockers,"" Anthony said. ""Tyson Chandler was a great shot blocker, Marcus Camby was a great shot-blocker. I've never seen a guy with 10 blocks in a game."" Before Friday night, Anthony had played in two games where a player had 10 blocks; both were accomplished by Camby in the 2007-08 season, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research. Damian Lillard added 28 points, including 10 in the final quarter, for the Blazers, who have won three straight after four consecutive losses. The Blazers led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter, but the Bulls pulled within 85-84 in the final period. CJ McCollum stalled the rally with a 3-pointer for Portland. Anthony's 3 made it 91-84 with 7 minutes, 28 seconds left and he held up three fingers for the cheering Moda Center crowd as the Bulls called a timeout. Lauri Markkanen's 3 closed the gap for Chicago to 93-92. Lillard answered with his own 3 to again hold off the Bulls. After Zach LaVine's corner 3 with 31.7 seconds left narrowed it to 105-103, Whiteside tipped in Lillard's shot for the win. ""I told the guys, I'm insurance now. When they go up for a layup, I'm going to be there. I might not get them all, I know a lot of people want me to get every single one, but I'm going to do my best job to get a lot of them,"" Whiteside said about his blocks. LaVine finished with 28 for the slumping Bulls, who have lost seven of their past nine games. This was a frustrating one, very winnable,"" LaVine said. ""We were battling. Dame did what he did in the fourth quarter, turned it up to another level."" The Blazers have been boosted by the recent signing of Anthony, who scored 25 points in Portland's 117-94 victory over the Bulls in Chicago on Monday. The Blazers acquired the 10-time All-Star to shore up the frontcourt and help the team overcome a slow start after going to the Western Conference finals last season. The deal was official Nov. 19. Between the two games against the Bulls, the Blazers defeated Oklahoma City 136-119 on Wednesday night. The Bulls fell to the injury-plagued Golden State Warriors 104-90 on Wednesday at the new Chase Center to open a three-game road trip. Tomas Satoransky was a game-time decision for the Bulls with a left toe bruise, but started. Ryan Arcidiacono, who has been slowed by a right elbow strain, also played. Coby White's layup put the Bulls up 28-22 near the end of the first quarter but neither team was able to reach a double-digit margin in the first half. Lillard's layup gave Portland a 49-43 lead late in the opening half and the Blazers went into the break ahead 53-47. LaVine led all scorers with 18 points at the half, but four of the Blazers starters were in double figures, including Anthony. Whiteside had collected seven blocks by early in the third quarter, but he also picked up four personal fouls. The Bulls pulled within 57-56 on Satoransky's 3-pointer, but Lillard came back with a 3 for Portland. The Blazers went up 72-60 midway through the third quarter on McCollum's 3-pointer as they appeared to pull away. But White's 3-pointer narrowed the gap to 79-76 and the Bulls rallied to within three points heading into the fourth quarter. ""This loss hurts, this is a painful loss, every loss these guys take hurts,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""This was a hard-fought game, give them credit."" TIP INS Bulls: The Bulls made 14 of 38 3-point attempts. ... Chicago went into the game with 187 steals this season, most in the league. ... It was the second of a three-game West Coast road swing that ends in Sacramento, California, on Sunday. ... The Bulls celebrated Thanksgiving and visited Nike while in Portland. Trail Blazers: Anthony's son Kiyan was at the game. ... Whiteside had four blocks in the first quarter alone. ... Portland has won seven straight against the Bulls. ... Anthony moved into 10th place in the NBA for 20-point games with 755. CAN THE BULLS BE SAVED? Forward Kris Dunn was asked afterward whether the Bulls' season was still salvageable. ""Absolutely,"" he said. ""If you look at the standings right now, things aren't going the way some teams would like it to go and that's good for us. We're still learning and trying to figure each other out. I think once we get a win and try to build off that, we can create a streak, and hopefully start creeping up the standings.""","401160920"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers have won 10 straight games for the first time since December 2009, when Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol rode that fast start all the way to their most recent championship. Nobody is ready to declare the current Lakers are headed for a similar summer after their streak hit double digits with an overwhelming effort against the Washington Wizards. Still, it's obvious something special is brewing again in LA. ""That's the best team in basketball,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Their record is 17-2 for a reason."" Anthony Davis had 26 points and 13 rebounds, and LeBron James had 23 points and 11 assists before both superstars took the fourth quarter off in the Lakers' 17th win in 18 games, 125-103 over Washington on Friday night. Quinn Cook scored 17 points and JaVale McGee had 15 points and 11 rebounds for the steamrolling Lakers, who went 14-1 in November to soar to the top of the overall NBA standings. Los Angeles hadn't won this many games in a month since March 2000 -- in another season that ended with a banner. Los Angeles' 17-2 start matches the best in franchise history, but the Lakers realize true history isn't made in November or December, which looks much tougher on paper. ""We have championship aspirations, but that's not what's here right now,"" James said. ""What's here is our next opponent. We want to continue to get better. We have guys who have been there and know what it takes. This is a long process, and we can never shortcut it. But we can enjoy it along the way."" The up-tempo Wizards have been one of the NBA's worst defensive teams this season, and the Lakers' dynamic offense was far too much for them. Los Angeles outscored Washington 84-36 during a 24-minute span extending from midway through the first quarter until midway through the third, when James' jumper put the Lakers up by 37. LA made runs of 17-0 and 18-0 during that one-sided stretch, showing off the remarkable chemistry already established in just the 19th game of the season for this newly minted superteam. ""I think we're tested every night,"" Davis said. ""We're going to get everybody's best shot no matter what, because of who we are. But it's up to us to make sure we lock in."" Bradley Beal had 18 points and nine assists and rookie Rui Hachimura had 16 points and eight rebounds for the Wizards, who have lost three of four. Washington had several good stretches, but committed 19 turnovers and dropped to 1-2 on a four-game West Coast road trip. ""They made a fair amount of mistakes just as well, and we forced them into it,"" Beal said. ""It's just a matter of sustaining our runs when we have them, and try to keep them from going on such large ones. They are a talented group."" Washington actually opened with a 15-4 lead before the Lakers began to dominate. Los Angeles jumped to a 21-point lead at halftime with 19 points from Davis, and the Lakers poured it on with an 18-0 run early in the third quarter, eventually taking a 90-51 lead. Isaiah Thomas scored 10 points to lead the four former Lakers on Washington's roster. TIP-INS Wizards: G C.J. Miles is out until at least next week with a left wrist ligament injury. He also missed Thursday's game at Phoenix. ... Brooks' jersey will be retired at UC Irvine on Saturday. The Northern California native spent two high-scoring seasons with the Anteaters from 1985-87 before his decade as an NBA player. ""It's humbling,"" Brooks said. ""It's awesome. I love Irvine. It's a terrific school."" ... Shohei Ohtani watched the game from a baseline seat near the Wizards' bench. The Los Angeles Angels' two-way performer posed for photos before the game with Hachimura, his fellow Japanese star. Lakers: Avery Bradley will be re-evaluated this weekend in his return from a hairline fracture in his right leg. The veteran has missed eight games. ... Kyle Kuzma limped off the court at the third-quarter buzzer. He returned to the game for the fourth, but left for the locker room later in the quarter. He has a left ankle sprain, and X-rays were negative, coach Frank Vogel said. MOE'S MOMENTS Moe Wagner, the Lakers' first-round pick in 2018, had seven points and eight rebounds for Washington. The German big man also committed a flagrant foul on Dwight Howard, who responded by hitting both free throws and then dunking on Wagner's head on the ensuing possession. Wagner eventually went to the locker room favoring his left ankle with several minutes to play. DWIGHT'S REUNION Howard had eight points, five rebounds and two blocked shots in his reunion with the Wizards, who signed him in July 2018. Howard played in just nine early games for Washington before a spinal injury forced him to miss the rest of the season, and his resulting long offseason of inactivity and soul-searching led to his decision to become a role player with the Lakers. Brooks says Howard has been to the Lakers ""exactly what"" the Wizards hoped he would be for them: ""Unfortunately, he was hurt. I have nothing bad to say about him. He worked hard for us, but just unfortunately didn't have the health to make a difference for us.""","401160921"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Sacramento coach Luke Walton views Harrison Barnes as a calming influence for the Kings, something that showed in a comeback win over Denver on Saturday. Barnes scored six of his season-high 30 points in overtime, Buddy Hield hit two free throws with 9.5 seconds left and the Kings rallied to beat the Nuggets 100-97. ""That's largely my role, to come in to help where needed,"" Barnes said. ""Some nights it's scoring. Some nights it's rebounding, some night it's defense. Some nights it simply just making the right play. That's something I try to do consistently for this team."" Barnes' leadership has become much more valuable while Sacramento plays without injured starters De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley III. He helped stabilize the Kings after they trailed by 17 at halftime, then came up big in overtime when he nearly outscored Denver by himself. ""Tonight, he showed again why he's so important to us on both ends of the court,"" Walton said. ""It was a good, solid win for our group, one that we needed and we worked for."" Sacramento didn't lead until Barnes made a jumper early in overtime. Gary Harris' 3-pointer put the Nuggets up 95-94, but Barnes answered with two free throws and scored on a short lean-in shot. Harris made two free throws before Hield answered with two of his own to help Sacramento end a six-game losing streak against Denver. The Kings became the third team this season to win after trailing by 17 at halftime, joining Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Nuggets failed to get off a shot in the final 15 seconds as Jamal Murray dribbled out the clock. ""We have to come up with something better,"" Murray said. ""The ball was in my hands, so it makes me look bad when that happens. We have to come up with something better, get open, and set some screens. It all comes out in the execution."" Nemanja Bjelica had 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Kings. Richaun Holmes added 13 points and 10 rebounds, and Hield had 21 points despite an off-night shooting. Harris scored 18 of his 25 points in the first quarter. Will Barton added 14 points, 12 rebounds and five assists. Murray scored 15 points. The Nuggets missed a chance to win in regulation when Holmes blocked Murray's shot from behind at the buzzer. ""You have to get a shot off at the end of regulation and you have to get a shot off at the end of overtime, and we didn't get a shot off either time,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""Obviously I have to do a better job in terms of helping us with that late game execution."" Sacramento was behind 75-67 entering the fourth. Hield, who struggled with his shot for much of the game, made consecutive 3s and scored on a driving layup to tie it at 90. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver scored 57 points in the first half but was outscored 60-40 after that. ... Nikola Jokic missed five consecutive shots in the fourth quarter. ... Harris' previous season high of 17 points also came against Sacramento. Kings: Holmes' double-double is his sixth this season, a career high. ... Bagley has yet to be cleared to play but is getting closer. The second overall pick a year ago, Bagley has been out since breaking his right thumb in the season opener. Fox (left ankle sprain) is also making progress in his rehab but isn't as close as Bagley. WINNING UGLY The Kings won despite shooting 38.5% from the floor. They are one of six NBA teams to win shooting at least that poorly.","401160922"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons stole a game for the 76ers. Simmons had three steals in the final 13.9 seconds to lead Philadelphia to a 119-116 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. ""I love being able to get steals and turn guys over,"" said Simmons, who finished with 15 points, 13 assists, six rebounds and four steals. ""I take pride in it and it gives us energy."" The Pacers led 114-113 with a chance to go up more when Simmons intercepted T.J. Warren's pass with 13.9 seconds remaining, then assisted Tobias Harris for a breakway dunk that gave Philadelphia the lead with 9.9 seconds remaining. ""I was going to steal it,"" Simmons said. ""If everybody on the backside does their job, it's easier to make a play."" After a timeout, Simmons then stole Jeremy Lamb's inbounds pass with 7.9 seconds remaining. That led to two free throws by Harris that gave the 76ers a 117-114 advantage with 5.1 ticks left. Malcolm Brogdon then made a pair of free throws after being fouled intentionally before Joel Embiid followed with his own two foul shots for a 119-116 Philadelphia lead with 2.8 seconds to play. Simmons clinched it for the 76ers when he stole Lamb's three-quarter court inbounds pass. ""Those turnovers late were costly,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""That was poor execution on our part."" Embiid had 32 points and 11 rebounds and was 15 for 15 from the free throw line. In three games since going scoreless for the first time in his career at Toronto on Nov. 25, the star center is averaging 30.7 points and 14.7 rebounds while making 40 of 44 foul shots. ""I changed my mindset,"" Embiid said. ""I hadn't been as aggressive, so I've been more aggressive creating contact and causing other people to foul me."" Harris scored 22 points for Philadelphia, which won its third straight while improving to 9-0 at home. Warren had 29 points and Brogdon added 28 for the Pacers, who had won five straight. Indiana opened a grueling five-game, seven-day road trip. Both teams were playing the second game of a back-to-back, but neither offense was sluggish. Indiana finished 55% (42 of 76) from the field while Philadelphia shot 49% (38 of 77). TIP-INS Pacers: T.J. McConnell finished with six points and three assists in 11 minutes in his return to Philadelphia, where he played from 2015-19. . Shot 50% (11 of 22) from 3-point range and 84% (21 of 25) from the foul line. 76ers: Josh Richardson (right hamstring strain) missed his second straight game. . Simmons took and missed a 21-foot jump shot with 4:05 left in the third. . Both Simmons and coach Brett Brown were assessed technical fouls by referee Natalie Sago. . Embiid was issued a Flagrant 1 for his foul on Domantas Sabonis with 9:49 remaining in the second. T.J. THE GREAT Brown spoke glowingly before the game about McConnell, who played the previous four seasons for the 76ers and was with Brown at the beginning of the rebuilding process. ""I just loved how hard he played,"" Brown said. ""He plays with his heart on his sleeve and this city loves him."" Brown said the intangibles are part of what attracted him to McConnell, but the guard showed he's more than just an ""effort"" guy. ""He can actually play and play well,"" Brown said. ""I'm very proud of him for his journey. I have a fondness for that man."" McConnell was feted with a video tribute in the first quarter, then received a standing ovation and was embraced by Brown when he entered with 2:59 left in the first. He also was presented a framed 76ers jersey prior to the contest by general manager Elton Brand. HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE Simmons praised Philadelphia's fans for helping the team remain perfect at home. ""We have the best fans in the NBA,"" he said. ""You go anywhere else and there's no atmosphere like it. We want to give everything we have to our city. It's a big responsibility.""","401160923"
"HOUSTON --  James Hardens performance on Saturday night was enough to make even those who see him put up gaudy numbers night after night step back and marvel at his work. Harden scored a season-high 60 points in 31 minutes and the Houston Rockets sent the struggling Atlanta Hawks to their 10th straight loss with a 158-111 romp. Its like everything else he does -- unbelievable, coach Mike DAntoni said. Harden came one point shy of matching his career high and franchise record on a night he made eight 3-pointers and 20 free throws. He watched the entire fourth quarter from the bench with Houston up 127-73 at the end of three. What hes doing has not been seen, teammate Austin Rivers said. My man had 60 and didnt play the fourth quarter. Name another player who could do that right now. It was Hardens fourth career 60-point game, tying him with Michael Jordan for third-most in NBA history, trailing only Kobe Bryant (six) and Wilt Chamberlain (32). Harden is the only active player who has scored 60 points more than once. But as usual he wasnt interested in talking about reaching 60 points while spending an entire quarter on the bench. Nope, he said before walking off and repeating the word two more times. The Rockets were missing starters Clint Capela and Danuel House because of illnesses, but still had no trouble handling an Atlanta team that hasn't won since Nov. 12 thanks to Hardens huge night. We try to do what we have to do against James, which is throw a lot of bodies at him, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Try and put him under duress. He just didnt feel us. Atlanta was never really in this one and was down by 20 points or more for most of the game. The flat effort came a night after the Hawks fell by one point in overtime to the Pacers in a game where Trae Young tied career highs with 49 points and eight 3-pointers. Young led the Hawks with 37 points and had five 3-pointers, but it wasnt nearly enough to offset Hardens game. The Rockets raced out to a 14-5 lead and had stretched their advantage to 81-52 by halftime behind 31 points from Harden for their third 80-point first half in franchise history. As good as Harden was in the first two quarters, it was nothing compared to how he dominated in the third. Houston was up 83-56 early in the period before he scored all of the team's points in an 18-3 run that made it 101-59 with 7 minutes left in the period. Harden made three 3-pointers and was fouled on 3-point attempts three other times in that stretch. He had eight assists, three rebounds, three steals and blocked a shot to go along with his 60-point effort. After the third quarter, Harden was sitting on the bench with a towel draped over his shoulders when he was shown on the video board with a note that said he was two points shy of setting his career high. Harden looked at the screen, read the note and pointed at it while opening his mouth wide in fake shock as if to say: ""I was so close,"" before smiling broadly. Yeah I was playing with the fans a little, but honestly I didnt know, he said. But we played a really good game those first three quarters so it was an opportunity for other guys to play minutes that theyve earned. There were a few half-hearted chants of: Harden! Harden! midway through the fourth quarter from a few fans who hoped to see Harden come back in to make Rockets history. But DAntoni kept the bearded superstar on the bench with the game well in hand. TIP-INS Hawks: Rookie Cam Reddish sat out with a wrist injury. ... Atlanta made 15 of 46-pointers. ... DeAndre Hunter had 14 points. Rockets: Isaiah Hartenstein received a flagrant 1 foul in the second quarter when he fouled Young hard near the neck. ... Russell Westbrook got a technical in the first half for yelling at the Atlanta bench. ... Capela missed the second straight game with his illness and House sat out for the first game with his illness. D'Antoni said he hopes both players can return on Tuesday night. ... Westbrook had 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ... Houstons 158 points were the second-most the team has scored this season. ... Ben McLemore scored 24 points and had 13 rebounds. MORE HARDEN Hes the third player in 25 seasons to have 60 points in three quarters, joining Klay Thompson in 2016 and Bryant (2005). Saturday was the 20th 50-point game of Hardens career, which is the fourth-most in NBA history and eight more than any other active player.","401160924"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo couldnt keep his double-double streak going, though its hard even for the NBAs MVP to put up big numbers in only 20 minutes. Antetokounmpo scored 26 points but his streak ended at 19 games when he grabbed nine rebounds in his shortest outing of the season, and the Milwaukee Bucks coasted to a 137-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Milwaukee (17-3) won its 11th straight and matched its highest point total of the season. The Bucks held a 17-point halftime lead and extended it to 101-75 entering the fourth quarter, allowing Antetokounmpo to sit out the final period. His streak of double-doubles to open a season left him short of Bill Waltons record of 34 with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1976-77. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 29 for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1975-76. I should have left him in, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said with a wry smile. Hes doing amazing things and theres more to come. Were trying to have conversations with him about being healthy and fresh and how important that is. Pretty incredible if youre being mentioned with the greats of our game. Pat Connaughton (team-high 10 rebounds) probably stole it. He steals all the rebounds. Antetokounmpo wasnt worried about the end of his run. That is not how I am built, Antetokounmpo said. I am not built around stats. Obviously, I am just here to win. The Bucks put nine players in double figures and finished November with a franchise-best 15-1 record, losing only on a buzzer-beating shot in Utah on Nov. 8. The 41-point margin was the team's largest of the season. Milwaukee has the league's second-best record, behind the Los Angeles Lakers (17-2). Hornets veteran forward Marvin Williams said Antetokounmpos dominating play was no surprise. Hes so competitive, always wants to win, Williams said. I feel he always wants to play the right way. Ive always been a fan of his. I dont feel like he did anything different than he normally does. He plays with such aggression on both ends of the floor. He attacked the basket and made plays for himself. Then when it wasnt there he kicked it out to his shooters. Robin Lopez, starting at center in place of brother Brook, sparked the Bucks with three 3-pointers and 13 points in 16 first-half minutes and wound up playing 24 minutes. Robin was in the starting lineup with Brook sidelined by back soreness. It was so cool to see him start the game that well and it just gave us a huge boost, Budenholzer said. Brook is such a big part of what we do and to have Robin step in and make those, it was really important to us. And it feels like its been coming. Robin Lopez ended 3 of 5 from beyond the arc and improved to 11 of 32 from 3-point range (34.3%), putting him ahead of his brothers percentage (28.9% on 97 attempts) this season. Numbers speak for themselves, right, Robin Lopez said of his newfound 3-point prowess. We got a lot of motion. We did a great job moving the ball, moving without the ball. Milwaukee shot 56.2% from the field (54 of 96) and limited Charlotte to 36.6% shooting (37 of 101). Devonte' Graham led the Hornets (8-13) with 24 points and Terry Rozier added 19. Milwaukee pulled away in the third quarter as it outscored the Hornets 35-26. Wesley Matthews had 12 of his 14 points in the quarter, going 3 of 4 from 3-point range and adding a three-point play. Khris Middleton came off the bench for the third straight game since returning from a thigh injury and added 15 points, and Ersan Ilyasova and D.J. Wilson each had 11. TIP-INS Hornets: Center Cody Zeller returned to action after missing the two previous games with a left hip contusion He had 11 points in 20 minutes off the bench.  Graham has made huge strides this season, entering Saturday averaging 17.9 points while shooting 41.1% from 3-point distance. Youre on the scouting report now; their best defender is on you now, Hornets coach James Borrego said of the second-year player. Youre getting their best look, their best scheme. Teams are blitzing him now and the kid is handling it extremely well. He has that poise about him. Bucks: Milwaukees 17-3 start is tied for the best 20-game start in franchise history (with the 1970-71 and 1971-72 teams).  Center Dragan Bender was active for Milwaukee after scoring 19 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in the Wisconsin Herds 133-115 win over the Erie BayHawks in G-League play on Friday night in Oshkosh. Bender entered Saturdays game in the third quarter and splashed a 3-pointer for his first points with the Bucks. He finished with 12 points.","401160925"
"NEW YORK --  Any win on the road is a good one, though Jimmy Butler really liked the way the Miami Heat got their latest. Down seven with 1:45 to play, they had to play almost perfect -- and on defense, they sure did. ""I think we finally showed ourselves what we're capable of when we guard,"" Butler said. ""If we don't make shots the way we normally make shots, there's still a way to win and we have to find that way to win. Tonight was a prime example of that."" Goran Dragic scored 24 points, including a three-point play that kicked off a closing 10-0 burst, and Butler added 20 as the Heat rallied to beat the Brooklyn Nets 109-106 on Sunday. Bam Adebayo had 17 points and 16 rebounds for the Heat, who trailed 106-99 but pitched a shutout from there and got the victory thanks largely to the aggressiveness of Butler. He kept attacking the rim and had five free throws in the closing run, overcoming his 5-for-17 shooting from the field. ""What it shows is the mental toughness of great players,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""The ball was not going in all night long but when it really gets to crunch time, when you need a bucket or it is going to be game over, he can put it aside, compartmentalize, and make the big plays. He did that."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 29 points and Harris had a season-high 25 for the Nets, who had won six of their previous eight games. But this was one in which they missed the playmaking of Kyrie Irving, who missed his ninth straight game because of a right shoulder injury. Without their All-Star guard, they couldn't get into anything against the tough Miami defense down the stretch and had just one basket in the final 4-plus minutes. ""A few key possessions kind of got away from us,"" Harris said. ""We didn't do just as good of a job as they did down the stretch to execute."" There were 24 lead changes and 12 ties in the game, with the Nets leading 65-58 at halftime after David Nwaba's 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left. Brooklyn's lead was one midway through the fourth quarter before Harris made two 3-pointers in less than 30 seconds. Butler answered with a 3 for Miami, but Dinwiddie scored five straight to make it 103-95, the largest lead for either team all game. It was 106-99 after another 3 by Harris with 1:45 to play, but that's where the Nets' scoring finished. ""We had opportunities, tons of opportunities. They made the plays, we didn't. Just one of those see-saw games,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. TIP-INS Heat: Dion Waiters was with the Heat but inactive, a day after returning to practice following his 10-game suspension for an incident on the team plane. He has not played this season but will travel on Miami's three-game road trip. ... Spoelstra said rookie KZ Okpala (strained Achilles tendon) was nearing a return and would hopefully begin working soon with their G League affiliate in Sioux Falls. Nets: Atkinson said he hadn't decided whether Dinwiddie would return to the bench when Irving returns, or continue to start alongside him until Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) is healthy. ""Lot of things to juggle there, but I think we've got to focus on this group right now and cross that bridge when we get to it,"" he said. GOOD GRADES The Nets went 9-6 in November, their first winning record in the month since 2012. Atkinson praised the way the responded to losing its starting backcourt during a five-game road trip early in the month. ""You start going into your 13th guy, 14th guy, 15th guy, can those guys come and help you win games?"" Atkinson said. ""And I'd just give our guys, our program, a B+, A in that sense, that we've come out of this thing with the injuries we've had looking in a positive direction. So I feel good about it in that sense."" THOSE GUYS IN GREEN Among the travelers in New York on the holiday weekend were two NBA teams who had games Sunday. Boston was visiting the Knicks and was too close for comfort for Spoelstra. ""It's awkward. We were staying in the same hotel as the Celtics. I wanted to walk right by them,"" he said with a smile. ""But that's this league. Going to talk about our travel coordination and changes.""","401160926"
"NEW YORK --  The Celtics usually beat the Knicks. The Knicks often blow big leads. So there was little reason for Boston to panic when trailing by nine points in the third quarter. Jayson Tatum scored 30 points, Jaylen Brown added 28 and Boston rallied past New York 113-104 on Sunday. Kemba Walker had 15 points and 10 assists, Enes Kanter contributed 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Brad Wanamaker also scored 11 points for Boston. Julius Randle led the Knicks with 26 points. Dennis Smith Jr. scored 17 and RJ Barrett had 16 for New York, which blew a 16-point lead to the 76ers on Friday and has lost six straight. Kevin Knox's long jumper put the Knicks ahead 72-63 with 7:20 left in the period, their biggest lead of the game. ""I don't know if we got down,"" Walker said. ""If there is one thing we're going to do it's to stay positive with each other. We stuck with it. We stayed together. There's going to be more games like this. It's a long year."" The Celtics responded with an 8-1 run and pulled within 73-71 on Walker's 3-pointer with 5:16 left. The Knicks were still up 93-87 in the fourth, but the Celtics went on a 17-2 run to take the lead for good. Semi Ojeleye's 3-pointer tied the score at 95-95, Brown followed with a steal and layup, Tatum hit a free throw, and Walker and Tatum hit consecutive 3-pointers to cap the run. ""At the start of the game we didn't come out with the stuff,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""But it's good that we can turn it to that level, and we had a couple of great ball pressure plays there at the end of the game that helped us create some separating. But I don't think we can keep going into games and giving up 85 points with 10 minutes to go and expect to be successful."" New York committed four consecutive turnovers during the decisive stretch. ""Tonight it was turnovers. Our turnovers sparked them,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""We had four straight turnovers and they capitalized on every one of them. When you have a lead, you gotta get shots on goal."" Brown's bucket with 1:39 left gave Boston its biggest lead of the game, 110-99. The score was tied 58-58 at halftime after a back-and-forth first two quarters. ""There's two halves to a game,"" Brown said. ""We didn't play as well as we wanted to play but it was tied at halftime. We came out in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, and lifted our energy a bit to pull out the win."" Knox finished with 11 points and Damyean Dotson added 10 for the Knicks. TIP-INS Celtics: Other than a 14-point loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in the season opener, every other Boston defeat this season has been by five points or less. ... The Celtics lead the all-time series against the Knicks 296-182, including a 160-64 advantage in New York. Knicks: New York has lost five straight to Boston. The Knicks have not beaten the Celtics since Nov. 21, 2018, and have not defeated them at Madison Square Garden since Dec. 21, 2017.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Playing without star rookie Ja Morant and veteran center Jonas Jonas Valanciunas, the remodeled Memphis Grizzlies knew Sundays look would be experimental for a collection of young players. The makeshift lineups produced the needed energy to pull out a win on the road. Dillon Brooks scored 26 points and Grayson Allen added 13 to push the short-handed Grizzlies to a 115-107 road win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. I hit the guys before the game with a simple message, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. I said were going to have some funky lineups out there. I just need guys going out and just competing. Thats what were all about. Thats what we need to get back to. And Im super proud of them. Jae Crowder had 12 points and 10 rebounds and Bruno Caboclo finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who were missing Morant because of back spasms and Valanciunas because of an illness. Brooks scored 20 of his points in the second half as the Grizzlies countered each Minnesota run to snap a six-game losing streak. We just found a way, figured it out, Brooks said. It started with our defense and then we translated it into our offense. Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Timberwolves. Andrew Wiggins chipped in with 18 points but Minnesota suffered a letdown at home after back-to-back road wins. Very disappointing, Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. You don't want to say it's games you should win, but we're getting guys back, I felt good going into this afternoon. Credit to Memphis, credit to Taylor, credit to that team. They played really hard, they executed, they were good. We lacked energy, big time. A sloppy start by both teams followed the afternoon tip-off. They combined to shoot 35% in the first half with 15 total turnovers. Neither team led by more than five points and Memphis went into half with a 48-47 lead after Minnesotas Robert Covington hit a buzzer-beating jumper after stealing an inbounds pass from Bruno Caboclo. The final minute included a 3-pointer by Josh Okogie that hit the side of the backboard, a missed layup by Grizzlies guard DeAnthony Melton and Okogie getting fouled at halfcourt while off-balance. We got to get back to the drawing board tomorrow, Towns said. Theyre a good team, but we came in with a lot of momentum, were home, we had three days off, we shouldnt have played with the energy that we had. The Wolves appeared ready to shake their lackluster start in the second half when they as Towns scored the teams first nine points and Minnesota tied the game at 61-all. Memphis followed with an 8-0 run. The Wolves had a 12-0 run to take a 72-69 lead before a 10-0 run by the Grizzlies. Memphis finished the third quarter with a 15-3 run in which Minnesota went without a field goal. TAKING OUT TOWNS Towns finished with his ninth straight double-double, but his shot was off. He scored just four points in the first half and finished the game 1 of 10 from 3. We just made his life hell, Brooks said. We pressured the heck out of him. We didnt want him to get into his spots. WELCOME HOME The Wolves welcomed back Memphis point guard Tyus Jones with a first-quarter video. A Minnesota native, Jones played four seasons for the Wolves. Jones said he was going to have about 75 family and friends in attendance. He had 12 points and seven assists,. Ive always appreciated the support that Ive received from everyone in Minnesota, Jones said. Its been nothing but love from the fans. We always support ours. Thats something that makes Minnesota special. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Morant missed the game with an aggravation of back spasms. The team announced that he is considered week to week with the injury. The No. 2 overall draft pick out of Murray State leads all rookies with 18.6 points per game.  Kyle Anderson (right heel soreness) was out. Brandon Clarke (left hip soreness) started after being labeled questionable but didnt play in the second half.  Memphis got 53 points from its bench.  The Grizzlies are 5-0 when Brooks scores 20 or more points. Timberwolves: Backup PG Shabazz Napier made his return after missing 12 games with a right hamstring strain. F Jake Layman missed his fifth straight game with a left toe sprain.  Wiggins was 1 of 6 from 3-point territory, tying Anthony Peeler for the most 3s in franchise history.","401160928"
"LOS ANGELES --  Luka Doncic dribbled up to LeBron James, stepped back and coolly drained a 3-pointer from well behind the line. The Dallas Mavericks driving force then threw a telling stare toward Dirk Nowitzki at courtside before he headed off to wrap up a major win. When the Mavs visited Staples Center a year ago, Doncic was nervous before he faced his boyhood idol, and he sought an autographed jersey afterward. Although the Slovenian youngster still admires the veteran star, Doncic is showing he belongs in the same galaxy. Doncic scored 21 of his 27 points in a dynamic second half, and the Mavericks snapped the Los Angeles Lakers 10-game winning streak with a 114-100 victory Sunday. Doncic also had 10 assists and nine rebounds in Dallas seventh victory in eight games. The Mavs erased a halftime deficit with a 28-5 run in an excellent third quarter led by Doncic, who had 16 points and five assists in the third after going 2 for 9 in a self-described awful first half. Its a great win that means a lot to us, Doncic said. It shows that we can play against big teams, too. We just need to keep it rolling. The Mavs comfortably maintained their big lead in the fourth, and Doncic provided some late showmanship by hitting that fourth 3-pointer over James and staring toward Nowitzki, who had center court seats. He hit a couple of hellacious shots, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Theres just a small handful of guys in the whole world that can hit them. LeBron James is one of them. Hes one of them. Those step-back 30-footers, its hard to describe how difficult the shot is, and how easy he makes it look. Delon Wright had 17 points and nine assists, and Kristaps Porzingis added 15 points as Dallas underlined its status as a likely title contender with an inspired second half on the road against the NBA-leading Lakers, who had lost only once in 18 games since their season opener. It means that we had a good day and did a lot of good things, but we need to stay humble, Carlisle said. Every time we have a game like this, people are more than ever throwing their best game at us. Theres a certain responsibility you have when you get on a roll like this. We need to understand it and keep our eye on the ball. James had 25 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Lakers, who dropped to 17-3 by losing this matchup between two of the NBAs highest-scoring teams. The Lakers longest winning streak in 10 years ended with their largest defeat of the young season. Its one game, said Anthony Davis, who had 27 points and 10 rebounds. Were not going to get down over this loss. We know what type of team we are, we know now. We played well. And they beat us, but we beat ourselves with the rebounding, so we know what weve got to do better. Los Angeles had won six straight over Dallas, but neither team much resembles the rosters that played the last few seasons in these jerseys. After a year of impressive moves by both franchises, the Mavs and Lakers are positioned to be back among the NBAs best. Exactly one month after the Lakers earned an overtime victory in Dallas, the Mavs responded with an impressive all-around effort at Staples Center. The Lakers had their worst day of the young season -- or at least their worst quarter while Dallas outscored them 35-17. They scored a few buckets, and we had a couple calls that went against us, said Lakers coach Frank Vogel, who got a technical foul along with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope for arguing in the third. I think our guys got consumed with that a little bit. But we didnt really have an offensive pop the whole quarter, coming out of halftime. Weve been really sharp and really consistent, but during that stretch we werent, and it cost us the game. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki got a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd after the Lakers played a tribute video on the scoreboard during a timeout in the second quarter. ... Dwight Powell had 15 points and nine rebounds, and Justin Jackson scored 15 points. Lakers: Kyle Kuzma played 21 minutes and scored four points despite spraining his ankle Friday against Washington. ... NL MVP Cody Bellinger and Dodgers teammate Kenley Jansen watched the game from courtside. ... Alex Caruso had 10 points and four rebounds. GETTING TOUGHER The Lakers revamped roster just completed one of the best months in franchise history, going 14-1 in November while soaring to the top of the NBA standings. Davis and James have meshed seamlessly, while their supporting cast has embraced new coach Frank Vogels commitment to defense. But the Lakers schedule gets much tougher in December, starting with this showdown and a three-game road trip in the upcoming week to Denver, Utah and Portland. James and Davis both expect to know more about their roster by January, and this opening game underlined the importance of a consistent effort, particularly on defense.","401160929"
"DETROIT --  Pistons coach Dwane Casey has believed since training camp that he was the right person to unlock Christian Woods potential. On Sunday, he got another sign he might be right. Wood came off the bench to score a career-high 28 points in 22 minutes as Detroit routed the San Antonio Spurs 132-98. Christian is a talent, and there are nights he does things like this and there are other nights when he doesnt, Casey said. Ive always said hes a talented young man, but he has to get more thinking into his game. If he could have consistently done that before now, he wouldnt be on his fifth team. After going undrafted in 2015, Wood played for the Philadelphia 76ers, Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks and New Orleans Pelicans before the Pistons claimed him on waivers in July. He didnt make an immediate impact in Detroit, either, falling behind Thon Maker on the depth chart. He rejoined the rotation in mid-November and has become a key part of Caseys second unit. Theres a big difference from where I was a couple years ago, he said. I would start with maturity and coach Casey. Hes hard on me, but I know it is tough love and now hes given me an opportunity. Along with his scoring, defense and rebounding, Woods performance had another benefit for the Pistons. He scored 19 points in the games final 14:59, giving Andre Drummond a lengthy rest with games coming on Tuesday and Wednesday. Drummond played 26 minutes and Blake Griffin played just 22 as the Pistons got 75 bench points on 67% shooting. Weve got five guys on our unit who can score the ball, and it is huge when (Derrick Rose) gets rolling, because he gets a lot of defensive attention, Wood said. Luke Kennard added 20 points for the Pistons, who had lost eight of 10. Detroit had seven players score in double figures, including four reserves. The Spurs, who lost for the 11th time in 13 games, got 20 points from DeMar DeRozan. San Antonio shot 41% from the floor, including 27% on 3-pointers. Yes, Im disappointed, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. We came out aggressively in our last game against the Clippers and we had energy and execution at both ends. They scored 97 and tonight we gave up 132. It was brutal. Detroit got 45 points off 3-pointers to San Antonios 21. This was another night where we gave up 3-pointers and didnt make any, Popovich said. But I think they did everything better than we did tonight. The Pistons led 59-51 at the half, outshooting the Spurs 51% to 41%. Detroit also had an 24-9 advantage in points off 3-pointers, but was hampered by nine turnovers. Detroit expanded its lead to 72-57 in the first 4 minutes of the third quarter. Bruce Brown had nine points in the surge. The Spurs fouled Drummond on back-to-back possessions later in the quarter, and he made one of the four free throws. Casey replaced him with Wood, who had put up nine points and four rebounds in 7 first-half minutes. Wood quickly added another nine points and two rebounds, helping the Pistons expand the margin to 96-71 at quarters end. Detroit outscored San Antonio 73-47 in the second half. We have got to get better defensively as a team and just bring energy, Spurs guard Lonnie Walker IV said. We have the talent, the players and the coaches, but were just not bringing it defensively. TIP-INS Spurs: C LaMarcus Aldridge (thigh) did not play. ... This season marks the 15th anniversary of San Antonios win over Detroit in the 2005 NBA Finals. Gregg Popovich is still coaching the Spurs, while Tim Duncan, who starred on that team, is now his top assistant coach. Pistons: Drummond fell one point short of the 377th double-double of his career, the most of any NBA player since he joined the league in the 2012-2013 season. Russell Westbrook (302) is the only other player with 300 in that span. ... Pistons rookie Sekou Doumbouya scored his first three NBA points in the fourth quarter.","401160930"
"Two babies surprise The Smoothie King Center with a hug during the baby race rather than reach the finish line. (1:14) NEW ORLEANS --  Chris Paul has seen just about everything in his 15-plus season. So, when it was a matter of who would take control of a tight game down the stretch against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, the 34-year-old Oklahoma City point guard simply drew on his deep memory bank and put everything on cruise control. With the Thunder trailing 94-89 with 5:15 left, Paul scored seven of his 16 points in a 12-0 run over the next three minutes to power Oklahoma City to a 107-104 victory over the Pelicans. Danilo Gallinari led the Thunder with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Steven Adams, Dennis Schroder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 17 points each. Adams also had 10 rebounds. But it was Paul who took over the game when the Thunder needed someone to step up. ""I don't know. It's just winning time,"" Paul said of the critical sequence that followed Lonzo Ball's fourth 3-pointer of the game, which gave New Orleans its biggest lead of the game. ""Fortunately, I've been in that situation a thousand times. If you're (not double-teamed), you go downhill and be aggressive. If you're doubled, you try to make the right play."" Paul started his streak with a pair of 15-footers near the free-throw line and then nailed a deep, fallaway, 3-pointer from the right baseline over the outstretched arms of onrushing 6-foot-11 New Orleans rookie center Jaxson Hayes, which gave the Thunder a 101-94 lead. ""I was just reacting,"" Paul said. ""I've shot that shot probably seven times straight and missed it, so I was probably lucky. Said Adams: ""I didn't even see Chris. He just disappeared."" The ball went in. On the Thunder's next possession, Paul fed Adams in the lane with a slick pick-and-roll pass, and Adams, shooting just 40% from the foul line this season, made both free throws. Adams made 3 of 4 down the stretch and finished the game 5 of 6. ""My eyes were closed every time, mate,"" Adams said, laughing. ""I was actually aiming for the top right corner of the backboard."" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said his team's second consecutive victory over the Pelicans -- the result of good decision-making in the final five minutes of the game -- was a credit to Paul's expertise running the show. ""Steven and Chris in the pick and roll in the middle of the floor was really good closing the game,"" Donovan said. ""I thought Chris did a great job managing the clock and managing the game and getting guys where they needed to go."" Jrue Holiday had 26 points for New Orleans, Brandon Ingram added 20, and Josh Hart had 11 points and 11 rebounds. The Pelicans have lost five in a row. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said he was puzzled by the disparity in free throws -- the Thunder took 26 foul shots to the Pelicans' 10 -- but added his team has to learn how to finish games. In a 109-104 loss to the Thunder on Friday night, the Pelicans went scoreless over the final 2:48. ""We just have to close games,"" Gentry said. ""Their star player, CP (Chris Paul), made plays for them, and that is what stars do, but we have to get it in the basket."" TIP-INS Thunder: The Thunder improved to 2-8 on the road. Pelicans: Ball returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous two games with a stomach virus. Ball has missed eight of the Pelicans' first 19 games, the other six because of a right adductor strain. ... Derrick Favors has missed the last three games following the sudden death of his mother. Her funeral was Saturday. ... Kenrich Williams sat out with a left ankle sprain.","401160931"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Evan Fourniers turnaround season is helping the Orlando Magic in the win column. Fournier matched a career high with 32 points that included the game-deciding basket, lifting the Magic over the Golden State Warriors 100-96 on Sunday night. Fournier, who had a dismal shooting season last year, was 13-for-21 shooting, including 6 of 10 from 3-point range against the Warriors. His biggest basket came with 9.3 seconds left in the game and Orlando clinging to a 96-95 lead. Fournier went one-on-one with Draymond Green, a former defensive player of the year. He beat Green off the dribble and continued through a wall of interior defenders to lay the ball in and give the Magic a 98-95 advantage. That was a great play, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Hes not just scoring for us, hes scoring efficiently, I mean 32 points on 21 shots, thats efficient offense. This was a big-time win, Fournier said. There are more opportunities for me (because of injuries) and coach (Steve Clifford) calls my name more. Im trying to make the right play. Terrence Ross came off the bench to score 19 points for the Magic, who struggled to make a shot. Orlando shot 42.5% (37 of 87), but the combination of Fourniers shooting and solid team defense were enough to get the win. Jonathan Isaac had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Markelle Fultz contributed 14 points and nine assists for Orlando. Glenn Robinson III led Golden State with 19 points. Eric Paschall scored 17 points and Alec Burks 15 for the Warriors, who had all five starters score in double figures, yet lost for the fifth time in six games. Golden State was down six going into the final minute and trimmed the deficit to 96-95 on a 3-pointer by Burks with 33 seconds to play. The Magic called on Fournier, and he drove around Green and through the heart of the Warriors defense to make a layup that gave Orlando a 98-95 lead with 9.7 seconds left. Burks hit one free throw to make it a two-point game and had one more attempt, but missed a 3-point try from the corner in the final second. Aaron Gordons two free throws pushed the final margin to four. Tonight was a really good fight, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. We were able to compete, and we defended like crazy. We couldnt do that against anybody in the first part of the season, so thats an improvement. Well get over the hump, but its just not there yet. The fourth quarter was back-and-forth, with neither side able to get more than a three-point lead until Ross drained a 3-pointer from the wing to make it 93-89 with 1:23 left in the game. Orlando increased its lead to six when Khem Burch made two free throws, but Golden State wasnt done. The Warriors made three of four free throws and Burks drilled a 3-pointer to make it 96-95 with 33 seconds left. Golden State couldn't finish off the rally from there. TIP INS: Warriors: Golden State scored only nine of its 51 points from the perimeter in the first half. ... Golden State had won 11 of its last 12 meetings with Orlando. ... Rookie F Eric Paschall has scored in double figures 10 straight games, averaging 18.6. ...

"TORONTO --  Fred VanVleet and the Toronto Raptors hardly anticipated an easy night against the Utah Jazz. ""I don't think any of us expected to be up 40 against that team,"" VanVleet said. Pascal Siakam scored 35 points, VanVleet had 21 points and 11 assists, and the Raptors used a record-setting first half to rout the Jazz 130-110 Sunday. Toronto led 77-37 at the intermission, the biggest halftime lead in franchise history, the biggest in the NBA this season, and tied for the eighth largest in league history. It also marked the biggest halftime deficit in Jazz history. ""We were awful,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Siakam (26 points) and Gasol (11) combined for as many first-half points as the entire Jazz roster, helping Toronto win its franchise-record ninth straight home game to open the season. The Jazz rallied in the second half but still suffered their biggest defeat of the season. Utah lost by 19 at Indiana last Wednesday. ""Obviously, our focus to begin the game has to be better,"" Snyder said. Siakam shot 4 for 22 and scored a season-low 10 points in Friday's win at Orlando but bounced back against by making eight of his first 10 field goal attempts. He shot 14 for 22 overall, matching his career high with five 3-pointers. He also had five against New York last Wednesday. ""He's got a lot of pride in his game,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""When he has an off game, I just think he comes out mentally ready to roll. You could just see him with aggressiveness and confidence."" Serge Ibaka returned after missing 10 games because of a sprained right ankle and scored 13 points in 21 minutes as Toronto won its seventh straight overall and improved to 5-2 against Western Conference opponents. Mike Conley scored 20 points and Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 11 rebounds as the Jazz lost for the third time in four games on their five-game trip, which ends at Philadelphia on Monday night. ""We didn't match their energy at all,"" Conley said. ""We knew it was going to be physical, we didn't handle the ball well. We didn't get back on defense, we didn't do little things that good teams do."" Utah's Jeff Green scored a season-high 19 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16. Utah took an early lead before Siakam scored 10 points and Gasol added eight during a 23-2 run, giving Toronto a 28-11 lead with 3:24 left in the opening quarter. Mitchell stopped the Raptors surge with a 3, but Siakam scored 19 points in the first as Toronto led 37-20 after one. After making just 5 of 27 field goals in the second quarter, the Jazz connected on 16 of their first 19 attempts in the third. Conley scored 13 points in the third and Mitchell had 11 as the Jazz outscored the Raptors 49-30 to cut the gap to 107-86. TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert missed a wide-open dunk in the first. ...

Toronto is 10-0 when OG Anunoby scores at least 10 points. He had 10 Sunday. HUGE HALVES The Raptors' 77 points in the first half was a season high. Their previous best was 66 in the first half at Milwaukee on Nov. 2, a game Toronto lost 115-105. Toronto's record for points in a half is 79, reached twice. The Raptors lost the most recent game in which they had a 79-point half, 132-129 at Cleveland on March 21, 2018. DEFENSIVE DOMINANCE Toronto allowed 36 points in the first half in Friday's road win over Orlando, the lowest-scoring half by a Raptors opponent this season. COMFY CUSHION Utah's 49-point quarter matched the biggest ever against the Raptors. Toronto also allowed 49 points in the fourth quarter against Chicago on Dec. 22, 2014. ""That's the point of getting up big, is to give yourself a cushion to finish out the game,"" VanVleet said.","401160933"
"LOS ANGELES --  Coach Doc Rivers called the first play of the game for Paul George and he hit a 3-pointer. His teammates found him the rest of the way. Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points, George added 31, and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past undermanned Washington 150-125 on Sunday night for their 12th win in a row over the Wizards at home. ""It's those new shoulders. He's just a great shooter,"" Rivers said of George. ""He's shooting deep shots on the move and doing it with great balance."" Montrezl Harrell added 23 points and a career-high 15 rebounds and Lou Williams had 22 points for the Clippers, who led all the way in improving to a franchise-best 12-1 at Staples Center. ""Their athletes are long, wiry and strong and defensive-minded,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""On top of that, they can score. That's a great benefit."" The Clippers shot 57% in taking a 27-point lead in the first half when George had 27 points. ""We just came out a little bit more aggressive as a unit,"" Williams said. ""We were very efficient on the offensive end. The shots we took a lot of times were ones we wanted to take."" George and Leonard combined to score 10 of the Clippers' first 13 points in the third when they led 95-69. The Wizards ran off 11 straight points to close within 15 in their only major spurt of the game. From there, the Clippers outscored Washington 19-12 to lead 116-98 going into the fourth. For the game, the Clippers shot 55%, owned a 66-46 edge in the paint and their bench outscored the Wizards reserves 73-39. ""We're pretty good once we're clicking,"" Williams said. ""Every once in a while you kind of see glimpses where guys are on the same page."" Rookie Rui Hachimura scored a career-high 30 points and Bradley Beal added 23 points and 11 assists for the Wizards. They were without injured John Wall, Moe Wagner, C.J. Miles and Ian Mahinmi in losing for the fourth time in five games. Davis Bertans had 20 points and a tied his career high with six 3-pointers for Washington. Leonard scored 11 of the Clippers' first 20 points in the fourth. George added a pair of free throws and Williams scored seven in the stretch that extended their lead to 138-107. Leonard and George then sat down and turned it over to the bench to finish off the blowout victory. It was the second time this season the Clippers scored 150 points. They beat Atlanta 150-101 last month. TIP-INS Wizards: They'll play the Clippers again next Sunday, the fourth time in series history the teams play both games in December. ...

They improved to 12-0 when leading at halftime. AT THE LINE The Clippers took 40 free throws and made 32. George hit all of his seven attempts, Leonard made all of his four and Williams made eight of nine. BEAL'S TECH Beal got called for a technical in the third after getting knocked down attempting a jumper. ""I just want the same respect everyone else is getting. Plain and simple,"" he said. ""Because any other time anybody else is coming up under your foot, even if it was unintentional or not, that's the rule. I have to be able to land on my own two feet and I didn't do that, but I got hit with a tech."" HACHIMURA'S ADJUSTMENT The rookie out of Gonzaga played a career-high 38 minutes, mostly because the Wizards were short-handed. ""I'm still trying to get used to the NBA games. It's different compared to college,"" Hachimura said. ""A lot of travel, a lot of games. I have to take care of my body more and I can play 30 minutes or 35 minutes every game and be physical.""","401160934"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  It didnt matter to Kelly Oubre Jr. that he missed his first seven shots from beyond the arc. Oubre learned a long time ago how important it is to keep on shooting. Oubre made his last two 3s, both coming in the final 55 seconds, and finished with 23 points as the Phoenix Suns overcame a seven-point deficit in the final minute to beat the Charlotte Hornets 109-104 Monday night. I was 0 for 7 at the time, but I just knew I could shoot the ball, Oubre said. I knew if I kept at it with the right mechanics they would fall. Oubre said hes worked tirelessly on his jump shot, eager to prove he can be a consistent 3-point shooter. People say that is one of my flaws, Oubre said. They say I can be a more consistent jump shooter. But at the end of the day, I am getting better. Devin Booker added 23 points and Dario Saric had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who snapped a three-game skid. Marvin Williams led the Hornets with a season-high 22 points. Devonte Graham finished with 15 points and 12 assists but was just 1 of 10 from beyond the 3-point arc and had four turnovers, including a big one late in the game. The Suns led by 20 at the break but squandered that lead and trailed by five in the final minute. Thats when Oubre knocked down back-to-back 3s to put the Suns ahead with 19.8 seconds left. The Hornets were setting up for the potential winning shot when P.J. Washingtons handoff went off Grahams leg with Oubre defending the play. Ricky Rubio added two free thows to push the lead to 107-104. Graham had a chance to tie it but airballed a shot from the top of the key with 9 seconds left. A series of mistakes in the final minute left Hornets coach James Borrego upset after the game. We know our job on a free throw box out, Borrego said. I dont care if youre 18, 20 or 40 years old out there. You know what were supposed to do. You know what we do on our coverages down the stretch. If you miss a shot, so be it. You may have a turnover once in a while, but there are some things that happened down the stretch that are inexcusable and just poor basketball. TIP-INS Suns: Were outrebounded 53-37. ... Booker was 3 of 10 from 3-point range. ... Frank Kaminsky had 12 points in his return to Charlotte. ... Ty Jerome made his NBA debut. He had four points and four assists in 12 minutes. Hornets: Nic Batum left the game in the first half with hand discomfort. Its the same hand that kept Batum out of 11 games earlier this season. ... Bismack Biyombo got a rise and a lot of laughs from his teammates when he successfully executed a Euro-step on a fast break. SLOW STARTS Before the late-game collapse, it appeared the Hornets were going to overcome a horrible first half in which they committed 15 turnovers and scored just 39 points while going 4 for 16 from 3-point range. Williams said he wonders how good the Hornets could be if they played with the same sense of urgency early in games as they down when they fall behind. Thats the big question around here, Williams said. It feels like we never really play as hard as we can until we get down by 5, 10 or 15. TIGHT COACHES Monty Williams and Borrego once worked together in the film room for the San Antonio Spurs. On Monday night they got to coach against each other. We got close, our families got close and when I got the job in New Orleans, Pop (Gregg Popovich) gave me a call and said one of the best things you could do was hire JB, and it was, Williams said of his friendship with Borrego. Weve been pretty tight ever since. ... Weve been together for a while and Im just happy that hes getting to run his own program, because hes a good dude.

"PHILADELPHIA --  James Ennis III hit a 3 and dropped for three pushups, celebratory calisthenics in an early run in which the 76ers flexed their offensive muscle ""I wanted to get a little workout in,"" Ennis said. Ennis passed the fitness test and Tobias Harris scored 26 points to keep Philadelphia perfect at home with a 103-94 win over the Utah Jazz on Monday night. Al Horford scored 17 points to help the Sixers win for the eighth time in nine games and improve to 10-0 at home. A night after the Raptors led the Jazz by 40 points at halftime, the Sixers led by a more modest 18 points at the break -- a cushion needed late to secure the win against Utah. ""We say every game before we get out there to protect our house,"" Harris said. ""Our crowd, our energy, our atmosphere, it's real."" Ennis, Philly's super sub, had the crowd going wild in the first half when he was fouled on a 3 and did three quick pushups to stretch the lead to 26 points. Ennis missed the free throw but it hardly mattered at home. The Sixers made 13 3s and have started to play more like a team expected to contend for an Eastern Conference title than one that slogged through a 2-5 stretch in mid-November. ""It's in the moment,"" Ennis said. ""I didn't mean nothing by it. And one."" Horford did his part, scoring five baskets in the first quarter for 12 points, to go with one ridiculous block. Bojan Bogdanovic took a turnover the other way and went straight down the middle for a layup attempt, when a hustling Horford caught up from the right and twisted his body for the rejection. They blocked, they exercised, they alley-ooped. Matisse Thybulle turned a steal into an alley-oop dunk for Ben Simmons and Harris came right back for a 3 that made it 52-27, a game the Sixers had in control until a late push by the Jazz got them within single digits. ""It's nice until they make a run,"" Simmons said. ""They're always going to fight."" Rudy Gobert led the Jazz with 27 points. The glaring blemish for the 76ers was another off-night for All-Star center Joel Embiid. Four games after Embiid went scoreless (0 for 11) against Toronto, he scored 16 points on just 5-of-13 shooting. Embiid played 29 minutes and continued to defy the load management expectations that had been set in recent seasons for the oft-injured big man. He looked gassed at the end of the fourth, right when the Jazz made a push to close within 10 with 4 minutes left. Joel Engles made it 99-92 on a 3-pointer with 57 seconds left to make it a bit uneasy for the Sixers before it dragged to its inevitable conclusion. ""There's a lot of teams, I think, in that situation that wouldn't have responded the way this team did,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. TIP-INS Jazz: G Mike Conley left in the second half with a tight left hamstring. 76ers: G Joel Richardson sat out due to right hamstring tightness, and G Trey Burke missed the game with an upper respiratory infection. ... Simmons had four steals and Thybulle had three. ... Brown was hit with a technical in the first half. SOUR NOTES The Jazz trailed by 26 early to make a late run -- highlighted by a 28-18 edge in the fourth -- nearly futile. ""You're in the hole like that, you look up and it can be overwhelming,"" Snyder said. ""I'm not trying to spin this like we're rejoicing what happened tonight. We've got to play better. There are things we can do better. We're going to improve. I feel good about that prospect given the fact we saw how we responded.""","401160936"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks found themselves laughing for the first time in a long time. Trae Young scored 24 points, rookie De'Andre Hunter added 18 and Damian Jones pitched in a career-high 16 points with eight rebounds as the Hawks beat the Golden State Warriors 104-79 on Monday night. The Hawks were just happy to win again after snapping a 10-game losing streak in a matchup of the two teams with the NBA's worst records. It was a season low in points scored for the Warriors (4-18) and the fewest the Hawks (5-16) have allowed in a game. Golden State dressed just nine players, even with center Kevon Looney returning to action after missing 19 games with a nerve condition. The opponent didn't matter to Atlanta. The only thing the Hawks cared about was winning. ""It feels good, obviously; we haven't won in a long time, which isn't a good feeling,"" Young said. ""We're all happy, but we have a long way to go ... We have to continue to get better."" Rookie Eric Paschall led Golden State with 24 points, but his teammates combined to shoot 24 of 72 and the Warriors committed 25 turnovers which the Hawks converted into 25 points. The visitors were missing Draymond Green, DeAngelo Russell and Stephen Curry, among others. ""It's frustrating to keep losing. We're all competitors,"" Paschall said after his 11th double-digit scoring game of the season. ""It definitely feels like a step back, getting blown out."" The Warriors led 23-20 after a quarter before Hunter scored six consecutive points for the Hawks early in the second period to give Atlanta the lead for good with a pair of jumpers and a couple free throws. The Hawks stretched a nine-point halftime lead to 76-53 in the third quarter when Vince Carter drained a long 3-pointer with 1:09 left in the period. Atlanta ranks near the bottom of every defensive category, yet they limited the Warriors to 39.8% shooting, and Golden State made just 3 of 17 3-point shots. Paschall made both his tries from long distance. ""We had good spirit, we were switching on and off the ball, making it difficult for them,"" Hawks head coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We knew they were on a back-to-back and they're down a lot of bodies ... It was more the spirit of our guys than anything technical we did."" Hunter scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half. He left the game midway through the fourth quarter with what was said to be a dislocated right index finger with no fracture. Pierce didn't believe the injury to be serious. The Hawks enjoyed their latest win in the locker room. ""The guys are in there, they're fun, they're happy. It's a different spirit than our last time out, "" Pierce said. ""The guys were in there cracking jokes on Cam (Reddish) for missing a dunk, laughing at De'Andre (Hunter) because he was in pain when he jammed his finger. ... It's good to see our guys feel and act normal after a game."" TIP-INS Warriors: Draymond Green did not play because of inflammation in his right heel. That heel kept him out of three games recently before he played in Golden State's two previous contest on a 24-minute restriction. Green will have his jersey retired Tuesday night at Michigan State, where he played collegiately. Several Warriors plan to attend, including head coach Steve Kerr. Teammate Klay Thompson, who is rehabbing a torn ACL in California, is slated to join the festivities in East Lansing, Michigan. Injured guard Stephen Curry will not make it, as he is scheduled for surgery Tuesday to remove pins from his broken hand. ... Former Hawk Omari Spellman, who was traded to Golden State last summer, had 10 points and nine rebounds. ""We didn't really execute what Steve wanted defensively so offense didn't matter,"" he said. ""When I first walked into the gym it was a little emotional. But it's still a job."" Hawks: Guard Allen Crabbe missed the game with flu-like symptoms. ... Rookie guard/forward Cam Reddish had an MRI on Monday morning on his bothersome left wrist. The scan revealed no more than a sprain. He played off the bench, scoring eight points on 3-of-10 shooting. ... Guard Kevin Huerter missed his 11th straight game with a left rotator cuff sprain but participated in a limited practice Monday morning. ... Forward John Collins remains suspended by the NBA. LOW PLACES After a competitive first quarter, the Warriors were gradually run out of State Farm Arena on the way to their sixth loss in seven games. ""A disappointing game, let's put it that way,"" Kerr suggested. ""We were playing for ourselves out there instead of playing for each other. (Losing) wears on you.""","401160937"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Indianas balanced scoring was too much for a makeshift Memphis Grizzlies lineup. Malcolm Brogdon scored 19 points, Domantas Sabonis added 18 and the Pacers beat the depleted Grizzlies 117-104 on Monday night. Seven players scored in double figures for the Pacers, including Myles Turner with 17 points. Jeremy Lamb and reserve Justin Holiday had 15 apiece, with Holiday missing only one of his six 3-point attempts. Holiday said I think guys are just ready, and when they get their chance they seize the moment. Its a testament to moving the ball, just playing together on both ends, Lamb added. Ball movement has become the key for the Pacers, who have won six of seven. Their passing and cutting provided open shots, and Indiana capitalized by shooting 50% from the field and hitting 16 of 38 3-pointers (42%). You move the ball to the open man and youre going to shoot a high percentage, coach Nate McMillan said. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with a season-high 31 points. Solomon Hill moved into the starting lineup and added 22, also a season best. Dillon Brooks finished with 19 on 7-of-16 shooting. The Grizzlies were short-handed as four players -- all key parts of the rotation -- sat out with various ailments. That left the reserves trying to play with any kind of rhythm. For the most part it was unsuccessful, but first-year Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said he was still proud of the effort, adding theres no excuses. We could have come out super flat, Jenkins said. I know our offense wasnt where it could have been, missing some shots, layups, 3s, but we competed. For McMillan, the key to Indianas recent success has been unselfish play. I just like the fact that were moving the ball, he said. Were sharing the ball, getting the ball to the open man. Normally, when you play that way good things happen. TIP-INS Pacers: Defeated Memphis 126-114 last Monday. ... Sabonis has reached double figures in all 18 games hes played this season. He also had 14 rebounds in his 15th double-double of the season.  T.J. Warren was held to 14 points, all in the first half. He had at least 23 in three of his previous four games. Grizzlies: Played without both their first-round rookies. G Ja Morant is nursing a sore back sustained in last Mondays loss at Indiana, and F Brandon Clarke is dealing with left hip soreness. Meanwhile, forward Kyle Anderson also sat out with right heel soreness. C Jonas Valanciunas was out with an illness.  Tyus Jones started in Morants place, and Hill replaced Valanciunas. It was Hills first start of the season. MELTON EMERGES Memphis reserve guard DeAnthony Melton benefited from the absence of other rotation players, playing a season high in minutes (just under 25) and scoring a season-best 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting. He also grabbed nine rebounds. Some think Melton should be getting more playing time, and his performance against the Pacers seemed to bode well. Loved it, Jenkins said, later adding: If he keeps having the simple mentality on defense and offense and keeps his game plan pretty simple for himself, I think he could have a really bright future. LEARNING FROM INJURIES With key players out, Memphis can learn something from the Pacers about how the absences can help create a balanced team. Indiana has had its share of injuries, including guard Victor Oladipo, who is rehabbing a right knee injury. Lamb has missed nine games, while Turner has sat out six. I feel like when a lot of people were injured, a lot of people were able to step up and get some playing time, Lamb said. We really saw what we had and it made us a better team. You dont always see that going through it, but now we see it has made us a better team.","401160938"
"MILWAUKEE --  Knicks coach David Fizdale knew his struggling team faced a huge challenge Monday night against the streaking Milwaukee Bucks. New York stumbled at the start and never had a chance as Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks won their 12th straight game in a 132-88 romp. Antetokounmpo needed only 14 minutes on the court to record another double-double, finishing with 29 points and 15 rebounds. The Bucks won by 44 points after beating Charlotte by 41 on Saturday, the first time in franchise history Milwaukee posted back-to-back winning margins of 40 points or more. It was the fifth time it's been done in NBA history. ""I don't feel we came in here with the idea we could beat this team,"" Fizdale said. ""That is what was most disappointing. They got whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. We never took a real stand."" The Bucks (18-3) led by as many as 47 and cruised behind Antetokounmpo, who pulled down his 10th rebound with 4:43 left in the second quarter for his league-leading 20th double-double. The reigning MVP shot 10 of 14 from the field, including 3 for 4 from 3-point range, while playing 22 minutes. He exited with nearly five minutes left in the third quarter and the Bucks ahead 93-54. ""I watch and listen to him lead his guys,"" Fizdale said. ""He's just impressive. The league is in good hands, I know that, when you've got a guy like that at the top."" Milwaukee's winning streak is the longest in the NBA this season and the franchise's best since the 1981-82 season. The Bucks own the league's top record, ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers (17-3). ""I think everybody shows up every day and they're hungry,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Nobody relaxes. We show up and do our job. We smile; we're having fun about it and it's nice. Usually teams tend to relax, but we don't do that."" The Knicks (4-17) posed little challenge as they shot just 4 of 24 in the first period and trailed 33-15 after one. D.J. Wilson added a career-high 19 points, Khris Middleton had 16 and George Hill 14 for the Bucks, who improved to 9-1 at home. The only Antetokounmpo playing in the fourth quarter was Giannis' older brother Thanasis, who drew cheers from the crowd when he slipped in for a layup early in the period. Thanasis Antetokounmpo, formerly a member of the Knicks, finished with 10 points and three assists. ""It was good for us to get everybody out on the court, have some other guys not play heavy minutes,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Julius Randle paced New York with 19 points and Damyean Dotson had 15. The Knicks shot 30.8% from the field (28 of 91) and made 25.6% of their 3-point tries (10 of 39). Rookie guard RJ Barrett was 0 for 9 and limited to two points in 20 minutes. TIP-INS Knicks: Point guard Frank Ntilikina was out after injuring his back in New York's 113-104 loss to Boston on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Dennis Smith Jr. started in his place and went 1 for 7 from the field while scoring four points. Veteran forward Marcus Morris (cervical spasms) missed his second consecutive game. Bucks: Middleton returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench the previous three games. He averaged 14.3 points in his three games as a reserve, after being sidelined for seven games with a bruised left thigh. Middleton had 10 points in the first six minutes of the game. ""It's just so great to have him back with the starters,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's got such a great feel and is so unselfish."". Brook Lopez (back soreness) was out for a second straight game, but Budenholzer was optimistic the 7-foot-1 center would return soon. ""Giving him a couple games is going to be really wise in the long run,"" Budenholzer said. ""Unless something changes he will travel with us and we're hopeful he will play Wednesday (at Detroit)."" ... The Bucks matched a season high with 58 rebounds, including seven each from Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Ersan Ilyasova and Pat Connaughton. DOMINANT GIANNIS Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the Eastern Conference player of the week after he averaged 34.8 points, 11.3 rebounds and four assists in four games last week. That included a 50-point outburst against Utah, the second 50-point game of his career.","401160939"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Zach LaVine kept getting to the free throw line down the stretch, Lauri Markkanen rediscovered his shooting stroke and the Chicago Bulls finally figured out a way to close one out. LaVine scored 28 points and made four free throws in the final 11 seconds, and the Bulls overcame a sloppy fourth quarter to hold off the Sacramento Kings 113-106 on Monday night. Markkanen had 20 points and seven rebounds, Wendell Carter Jr. added 10 points and 10 rebounds, and Tomas Satoransky scored 14 points as Chicago snapped a three-game losing streak. ""We made the plays we had to make,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""We fought back from being down, we got a lead then we lost it, then we fought back again."" The Bulls (7-14) led by 19 early in the second half but had trouble hanging on. Chicago committed eight of its 18 turnovers in the fourth quarter and made only one basket over the final 4 1/2 minutes. Buddy Hield hit a step-back jumper that pulled the Kings to 102-100 with 2:18 remaining. After Markkanen made two free throws, he and Hield exchanged 3-pointers to make it 107-103. Sacramento got the ball back but Hield missed three shots from beyond the arc in the last 36 seconds, and LaVine sealed the game at the free throw line. ""We're supposed to do things like that,"" LaVine said. ""I think we've been underperforming up to this point. We should be playing like this. We should be getting these wins and holding teams off, but we haven't. We have to prove it not just to the general public and other teams, but to ourselves."" Getting Markkanen going was a key factor for Chicago. He had been held to nine points or fewer in four of the last seven games and went into this one averaging 13.3 points. Against the Kings, he shot 6 of 12 and made four 3s. It's the first time this season Markkanen and LaVine have scored 20 or more in the same game. ""I've been trying to find my spots and it's been a lot of 3s, so I'm glad I got to the rim a couple times,"" Markkanen said. Hield finished with 26 points for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes added 20 points and nine rebounds. ""We took them lightly. We didn't respect them enough,"" Hield said. ""We were up by 11 and we got too cool. When you give a team confidence, they come back to bite you quick."" The Bulls took control with a 21-6 run to start the second quarter. After Carter, Kris Dunn and Markkanen scored on consecutive dunks, Markkanen added a 3-pointer -- Chicago's fifth of the period -- and Lavine made a reverse layup to extend the lead to 54-39. Sacramento trailed by 19 early in the third quarter, then went on a late run to pull to 84-74 after a pair of free throws from Harrison Barnes. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had nine steals, giving the Bulls 204 in 21 games this season. They became the fastest Eastern Conference team to reach 200 since Boston did it in 18 games in 2015-16. . Eight players scored in the first quarter. Kings: Trevor Ariza went scoreless in 12 minutes after missing the previous six games for personal reasons. . Sacramento had won its last four against Chicago. QUOTABLE ""Once he made his first two, he started looking like back to old Lauri. Hopefully, it's wheels up from there."" -- LaVine on Markkanen.","401160940"
"CLEVELAND --  The Detroit Pistons are suddenly on a roll. Blake Griffin scored 24 points, Andre Drummond had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and the Pistons routed the Cleveland Cavaliers 127-94 Tuesday night to win consecutive games for the first time this season. The Pistons thumped San Antonio 132-98 on Sunday and put together another dominant performance, shooting 54% and hitting 18 of 35 3-point attempts. ""We're building it, we're getting better,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""We're not there yet, but we're getting closer."" Griffin played just 24 minutes and was 8 of 13 from the field, including 6 of 7 from deep. Drummond played 31 minutes as Detroit's starters were on the bench for the fourth quarter. Griffin scored 16 points in the first quarter with four 3-pointers. The 6-foot-10 forward missed training camp and the first 10 games of the season with a hamstring injury. ""He didn't have an exhibition season, so he's still getting his sea legs under him and is playing his way back into shape,"" Casey said. Griffin was called for traveling after Detroit won the opening tip but hit a 3-pointer a minute into the game. ""I don't think we've called the first play of the game for me all season, but that's OK,"" he said with a smile. ""It's not how I really get into it. I just do my thing and take what they give me."" Detroit hit 10 3-pointers in the first half and built a 57-38 lead, a margin that steadily grew and reached 35 in the fourth quarter. Cleveland has lost 10 of 11. The Cavaliers were coming off a loss to Milwaukee in which they cut a 22-point margin to three late in the game. ""It's really a tough one for us,"" Cleveland forward Kevin Love said. ""We were pretty happy with most of the game last game and how we played. Tonight we came out and laid an egg."" Collin Sexton scored 22 points, and Tristan Thompson had 10 points and 14 rebounds. Cleveland coach John Beilein removed all five of his starters late in the third quarter with the Cavaliers trailing 87-60. Cleveland's starters returned in the fourth quarter, but the lead reached 111-76 midway through the period. The Cavaliers had a 15-0 run to go ahead 28-24 late in the first quarter, but Detroit outscored Cleveland 38-18 over the final 13:25 of the half. Svi Mykhailiuk scored 15 points for Detroit, which had six players in double figures. Langston Galloway had 14. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit is 2-9 on the road. ... The Pistons and Cavaliers played for the first time this season and will meet three times in January.? Cavaliers: Cleveland didn't shoot a free throw until the 2:29 mark of the second quarter when it trailed 59-40. ... Rookie G Dylan Windler, who has been out all season with a stress reaction in his left leg, is expected to play for Canton of the G League on Thursday. Windler, the 26th pick in the draft, practiced with the Cavaliers on Sunday and Monday. INJURY UPDATE The Pistons announced point guard Reggie Jackson, who has missed the last 19 games because of a stress reaction in his lower back, is showing progress in his recovery and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Jackson, who played in all 82 games last season, was injured against Atlanta on Oct. 24. ""That is encouraging news,"" Casey said. ""Bruce (Brown) has done a good job treading water at point guard after being a forward in college, but we're looking forward to getting Reggie back.""? FAMILIAR TERRITORY Beilein coached against the Pistons for the first time since leaving Michigan and taking over the Cavaliers job. It was pointed out before the game the Wolverines lost a total of 15 games under Beilein the last two seasons. Cleveland is 5-15 this season. ""Thanks for reminding me,"" he said with a laugh. The Cavaliers have lost four of five on a homestand that ends Friday against Orlando.","401160941"
"WASHINGTON --  A game against his hometown team provided the latest highlight in Markelle Fultzs development. Fultz, a native of nearby Marlboro, Maryland, scored a career-high 20 points and added six assists in the Orlando Magics 127-120 victory over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. I caught a lot of eyes with a lot of family (and friends in the crowd), Fultz said. It brings joy to my heart to know that they can see me playing basketball happy and just doing what I love. Fultzs previous career high was 19 points in a home win over the Wizards on Nov. 17. The No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA draft, Fultz played just 14 games for the Philadelphia 76ers as a rookie and 19 last season because of a shoulder injury. He played his 20th game of the season Tuesday and came in averaging 11.7 points. He's a baller, forward Aaron Gordon said. This is what we expect from him every night, not just in his hometown. Evan Fournier scored 31 points and D.J. Augustin added 16 of his 24 in the fourth quarter for Orlando, which has won three of four after earning just its second road victory of the season. Theyre a long, athletic team and I thought they made 3s throughout the game but they made timely ones as well, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. We fought and we battled and we were obviously short-handed but we competed. Bradley Beal scored 42 points for the Wizards, who have lost five of six. Fournier scored 32 in Sundays win over the Golden State Warriors. Davis Bertans added 21 points and Isaiah Thomas scored a season-high 20 for Washington. The Wizards were without starting center Thomas Bryant, who was diagnosed with a stress reaction in his right foot Tuesday and will be re-evaluated in three weeks. The Wizards trailed by 14 at halftime but Bertans second 3-pointer of the quarter pulled Washington within 74-67 early in the third. Beals 3-pointer followed by Thomas basket and another 3 by Beal gave Washington its first lead of the game at 75-74, completing a 21-6 run. Orlando answered and when Michael Carter-Williams scored five straight points late in the quarter the Magic led 94-84. A flagrant foul call on Beal contributed to seven straight points by Augustin in the fourth and Orlando led 104-88 with 10:45 remaining. Thats kind of been our Achilles heel in the past, Beal said. We fight so hard to get back into the game, and maybe take the lead, but you use so much energy trying to get back into the game that you might be gassed at the end. The Wizards got within 127-120 on Jordan McRaes 3-pointer with a minute left. TIP-INS Magic: Gordon had 18 points and 11 rebounds.  Carter-Williams returned after missing six games because of left hip irritation and scored five points in 13 minutes. Wizards: Were outrebounded 48-38.  Were also without reserve center Moritz Wagner (left ankle sprain) and reserve guard C.J. Miles (left wrist ligament injury).  Beal tied Gilbert Arenas (255) for the fourth-most games with 20-plus points in franchise history. SHOT MAKERS The Magic shot 50% for the first time this season, hitting 51.1% from the field (46 of 90), including 15 of 31 from 3-point range. SHAKE IT UP With Bryant out, rookie forward Rui Hachimura (15 points) slid over to the center spot with Bertans starting at forward. Isaac Bonga started in place of Troy Brown Jr., who had five points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench. We need his defensive tenacity, his staying in plays, his length, Brooks said of Bonga before the game. It also gives Troy a spark. He hasnt played well. Hes done a lot of good things, but theres things (he) knows he can play better, and I think this could give him a spark playing with that second unit.","401160942"
"TORONTO -- Jimmy Butler delivered a triple-double to beat Toronto, then turned his focus to Miami's next opponent with an unbeaten home record. Butler had 22 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists, Duncan Robinson scored 22 points and the Heat spoiled Kyle Lowry's return to Toronto's lineup by beating the Raptors 121-110 in overtime Tuesday. ""I'm not going to say that this one is more special than any other one,'' Butler said of Miami's third consecutive victory and second straight on the road. ""Just two good teams going at it. We were fortunate enough to do our job.'' Butler scored eight consecutive points in 55 seconds to begin the extra session as the Heat recovered after blowing a seven-point lead in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. ""When it's closing time, he just makes whatever play is needed,'' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami also won at Milwaukee on Oct. 26, a 131-126 overtime victory. The Heat are the only road team to beat the Bucks this season. Miami closes its three-game road trip at Boston on Wednesday. The Celtics (7-0) are one of three NBA teams yet to lose at home this season. Philadelphia (10-0) and Miami (8-0) are the others. ""We talked about it: We've got one more to win,'' Butler said. ""We'd better get over this one fairly quickly.'' Butler became the 10th player in Heat history to post a triple-double, achieving the feat for the fifth time. ""He was doing even more stuff that you won't see in the box score: encouraging guys, talking, being in gaps defensively,"" Miami's Justise Winslow said. ""He was fantastic for us.'' Bam Adebayo scored 18 points, Winslow had 17 and Kelly Olynyk 16 as the Heat snapped the Raptors' season-high winning streak at seven games, and became the first visitors to win north of the border this season. ""Those guys are exhausted in there,'' Spoelstra said, gesturing to his team's locker room. ""They earned their ice.'' Pascal Siakam had 15 points and 12 rebounds, Norman Powell scored 23 points and Fred VanVleet had 19 for Toronto, which had won a franchise-record nine straight home games to begin the season. ""We didn't have the greatest energy, I didn't think, especially in the first half,'' Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Toronto missed all nine of its field goal attempts in overtime, eight of them from 3-point range. Lowry returned after missing 11 games because of a fractured left thumb. The five-time All-Star missed his first 11 shot attempts, including seven from 3-point range, before making a layup with 8 minutes, 40 seconds to go in the fourth. He finished 2-for-18, including 0-for-11 from 3-point range. Lowry had 12 points and 11 assists in 41 minutes. ""That was terrible,"" Lowry said, blaming his poor performance on rust. ""I'm sure I'll be better next game. It's nothing to be concerned or worried about.'' Toronto trailed 107-100 after Winslow's layup with 1:59 to go in the fourth. Powell hit a 3, Lowry made a pair at the line and, after a missed jumper by Winslow, Powell connected from the corner to give the Raptors a 108-107 lead, their first of the final quarter. Butler tied it by splitting a pair of free throws and Siakam saw his shot blocked at the other end, giving the Heat the ball with just under 20 seconds remaining. Miami advanced the ball before Spoelstra called timeout with 9.3 seconds to go. Butler pulled up for a 3 over Powell, but his shot bounced off the rim, sending it to overtime. TIP-INS Heat: Miami was without guard Goran Dragic (strained right groin). Dragic, who was injured in the first half of Sunday's win at Brooklyn, is also expected to miss Wednesday's game in Boston. ... G Dion Waiters was in uniform for the first time this season.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Luka Doncic has Dallas coach Rick Carlisle searching for new superlatives to describe his second-year star. Doncic scored 15 of his 33 points in the third quarter and grabbed 18 rebounds in just 28 minutes to power the Mavericks to a 118-97 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. ""Eighteen rebounds is a lot. That's a lot of rebounds for a point guard,"" the normally measured Carlisle said with a smile. ""I don't care what planet you're from. That's tremendous."" Doncic shot 9 of 18 from the field, making five 3-pointers, and hit 10 of 13 free throws to lead the Mavericks to their eighth victory in the last nine games. The 6-foot-7 Doncic had 12 points the first quarter and then broke open a three-point game by scoring 15 of the Mavericks' 25 points in the final 9:18 of the third, when Dallas built a 84-75 lead. Two of Doncic's jumpers came from at least 25 feet with no defender in his face. ""I can shoot from halfcourt, too,"" Doncic said with a laugh. ""He has unlimited range,"" said Dallas center Kristaps Porzingis, who was saddled with early foul trouble and played only 18 minutes, allowing him to watch the Doncic show. ""Not only that, but he can get to the rim any time he wants and facilitate for others. He's hooping right now."" Or, as Dallas owner Mark Cuban said when walking out of the Mavericks' locker room: ""He's unbelievable."" Dallas led by as many as 18 points in the fourth quarter and coasted home. Doncic said his rebounding wasn't that difficult against the Pelicans. ""I felt like the ball was just coming into my hands after they missed,"" he said. ""I didn't even know I had 18."" Seth Curry added 19 points off the bench for the Mavericks, and Tim Hardaway Jr. and Maxi Kleber each had 12. Brandon Ingram scored 24 points and Jrue Holiday had 18 for New Orleans, which lost its sixth consecutive game. Doncic had 18 points and eight rebounds to spark the Mavericks to a 59-53 halftime lead. The Mavs overcame a sloppy offensive start in which they committed five turnovers in the first 3:44 and also misfired on 23 of their first 29 shots. The Pelicans scored the first 11 points of the second quarter to take a 35-24 lead, but Dallas responded with a 27-11 run, getting most of its firepower from the bench. Backup point guard J.J. Barea nailed back-to-back 3-pointers and added a driving bank shot to lead the surge. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said his team played well enough defensively but could not overcome 27% 3-point shooting and 40% shooting overall. ""You've got to be able to score, and we couldn't get the ball in the basket tonight,"" Gentry said. ""We missed 12 layups. We missed 21 shots in the paint."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis finished with seven points. ... The Mavericks won just nine road games all last season but are 8-2 away from home this season. . Carlisle said Justin Jackson's improved play is in part due to his summer work, when he put on 15 pounds of muscle. ""He's a guy that gives us a lot of versatility."" Pelicans: Lonzo Ball was 2 of 10 from 3-point range. . Gentry is trying to solve his team's end-of-game woes. ""We have a tendency to fall off, especially in the last six minutes of the game. It's almost as if we play isolation basketball. We've got to get away from that."" . Gentry marveled at Doncic's wise-beyond-his-years game. ""He's been doing this since he was 15 years old. He's been playing with grown men. He was European player of the year when he was 18."" AWARD WINNER Doncic was chosen the Western Conference player of the month for November, and Carlisle said it was richly deserved. ""He's been great really from the start of the entire season,"" Carlisle said. ""It's really cool. The guy's fun to watch, and he's a great competitor.""","401160944"
"SAN ANTONIO --  James Harden had a slam dunk waved off by officials, the first sign that it might not be the Houston Rockets night. Lonnie Walker IV helped make sure of that. Walker had a career-high 28 points and the San Antonio Spurs overcame Hardens 50 points by rallying from a late 10-point deficit to beat Houston 135-133 in double overtime Tuesday. Harden played a season-high 49 minutes coming off a 60-point outing Saturday over three quarters against Atlanta, but he was whistled for two charges in the second overtime. The second came against DeMar DeRozan with 0.8 seconds remaining, sealing San Antonios victory. That followed a bizarre moment in the fourth quarter, when officials erased Hardens dunk with 7:53 remaining and Houston leading 102-89. Officials ruled the ball didnt clear the cylinder, but crew chief James Capers said after the game that, in fact it did clear the net and should have been a successful field goal. Capers said the Rockets did not ask for a review within the 30-second window that coaches can challenge calls, during which time they were arguing and asking for clarification. The botched call crushed Houstons momentum. We just stopped playing and they gained confidence, Harden said. The Rockets led by 22 in the second half and were up by double digits in the fourth quarter for all but the final 4:18. Walker, a second-year guard who has been patiently waiting on the bench most of his career, took over in his first extended playing time to fuel the comeback. It was confidence, Walker said. My teammates kept me going, and once I started feeling it, Im just going to let it go and play my game. I know what I can and cannot do. Im just happy that we played team ball and we got this win. DeRozan added 23 points, nine assists and five rebounds as the Spurs won their second straight at home and snapped the Rockets two-game winning streak. They played faster but more sense of urgency than we did, especially being up, Houston point guard Russell Westbrook said. Harden had six points in the second overtime, including a follow of Clint Capelas missed free throw with 1:41 remaining to put Houston up 131-128. Bryn Forbes tied it at 131 with a 3-pointer, and the teams traded free throws the remainder of the game. In addition to drawing the late charge on Harden, DeRozan was also 3 for 4 on free throws in the final 30 seconds. Thats who he is, hes the leader of the team, Walker said. We expect him to score in crunch time and make big plays and thats exactly what he did. He got us this win. Capela had 22 points and 21 rebounds, and Austin Rivers and Westbrook added 19 points apiece for Houston. Westbrook was 7-of-30 shooting but added 10 assists and 10 rebounds. The Spurs were without starting power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who missed his second straight game with a sore right thigh. San Antonio responded with a group effort to beat the Rockets four days after knocking off the Los Angeles Clippers at home. This is a team that we think we have, weve just got to play like this consistently and we havent really done that, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. So, hopefully, were starting to figure that out. Forbes added 25 points, Jakob Poeltl had 15 rebounds, five blocks and five assists, and Rudy Gay added 14 points in 23 minutes. Houston outscored San Antonio 7-2 in the final two minutes of overtime to force a second OT. Hardens runner bounded off the backboard and rim as the first overtime ended. Walker had 18 points in the fourth quarter, including eight straight to close the period and force overtime. Walkers run started with an alley-oop dunk followed by consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 115-all with 11.5 seconds remaining. He is the most athletic player on this team, DeRozan said. He can do some things a lot of us cant. He was just going out there playing with his will and ability and he got it going. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden remained in the game after tweaking his left ankle and tumbling to the court with 5:26 remaining. Capela appeared to step on Harden trying to save the ball. Harden rose slowly and jogged gingerly upcourt but played all but the final 2:27 of the first quarter. ... Danuel House sat out with an undisclosed illness. Spurs: Walkers previous career highs were 16 points against Denver on April 3 and 26 minutes against Golden State on Feb. 6. He played 35 minutes Tuesday. ... Forbes had 25 points before fouling out with 48.5 seconds remaining the second overtime.","401160945"
"Anthony Davis discusses his attention to the defensive side of his game for the Lakers. (0:42) DENVER --  LeBron James has been compared to Michael Jordan for his entire career, though on Tuesday night it was Anthony Davis who emulated the Hall of Famer. Davis, ailing from flu-like symptoms, took an IV at halftime and then scored 13 of his 25 points in the third quarter to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 105-96 victory over the Denver Nuggets. James also had 25 points, nine assists and a crucial dunk off a miss late in the fourth quarter to clinch a matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference. Jordan's legend grew when he played through the flu in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals, leading the Chicago Bulls to the win and eventually their fifth title in seven years. Tuesday's game was just the 20th of the season for the Lakers but Davis' effort still impressed his coach. ""For him to play through illness and have that kind of performance was something special,"" coach Frank Vogel said. Davis missed the morning film session and his status for the game was questionable until before tip. He showed no effects of the illness, scoring most of the Lakers 24 points in the third quarter. He also had 10 rebounds and helped to hold Nuggets center Nikola Jokic to 13 points. He played nearly 37 minutes after trying to recover for most of the day. ""Sleep. That's really it. Sleep and a couple of medicine things here and there,"" he said of the treatment he took. ""The IV at halftime was trying a way to keep going."" Jamal Murray scored 22 points and Paul Millsap had 21 points and eight rebounds. Jokic added eight assists but wasn't the only one struggling on offense. Denver shot 40.7% and failed to reach 100 points for the second straight game. ""We got the looks we wanted but just didn't hit some shots,"" Murray said. Both teams were coming off losses that ended long winning streaks, but it was Los Angeles that bounced back behind James and Davis and a 56-35 advantage in rebounding. The Nuggets nearly came back in the final minutes. The Lakers led by 10 midway through the fourth before Denver rallied to get within a point with 2:23 left. But the Nuggets didn't score again. The Lakers hit three free throws and James slammed home Davis' missed layup with 1:15 remaining. ""They're one of the top teams to come back from double-digit deficits in the second half,"" James said. ""We knew they were going to make a run. A very good team at home and we just kept our composure."" Denver has lost two in a row for the second time this season and fell to 8-3 at home. ""They are a better team than us right now,"" Millsap said. ""We didn't bring our best game but we were still in the game. If we could have knocked those shots down it would have been a totally different ballgame."" TIP-INS Lakers: Vogel was chosen as Western Conference coach of the month for games played in October and November. The Lakers 17-2 record tied for the best 19-game start in franchise history. ... The Lakers had two goaltending calls in the first quarter. Nuggets: Jokic had more turnovers (five) than made baskets (four). ... Denver Broncos linebacker and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller as well as former Broncos and Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning were in attendance. MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY Nuggets coach Michael Malone was an assistant in Cleveland during James' first stint with the Cavaliers and praised the star's sustained excellence. ""What he's doing at his age, I mean, who is surprised?"" Malone said before the game. ""...LeBron is incredible and that's why he'll go down as one of he best players to ever play the game."" Vogel was also complimentary of Jokic. ""There's no one like the Joker I think that's every played the game,"" he said. SICK BAY Davis wasn't the only Lakers player dealing with a bug ahead of the matchup of the top teams in the conference. ""We have several guys with flu-like symptoms and we had them drink a lot of fluid,"" Vogel said.","401160946"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers are still figuring things out even while theyre piling up wins. Their latest came with the bench outscoring the starters, 66-51. Montrezl Harrell scored 26 points, Paul George added 25 and Los Angeles pulled away in the second half to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 117-97 on Tuesday night. The best thing about this team is were not near where were going to be, coach Doc Rivers said. Kawhi Leonard had an off-night offensively, scoring 11 points on 3-of-15 shooting, but still helped extend the Clippers franchise-best start at home to 13-1. He set the tone with his passing, Rivers said. Early he tried to get everybody else going and then he tried to get himself going. CJ McCollum scored 20 points, Hassan Whiteside had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Damian Lillard added 16 points on 5-of-15 shooting for the Blazers, whose three-game winning streak ended. Carmelo Anthony had nine points and six rebounds two weeks after signing with the Blazers in his return to the NBA. Lillard and Anthony were held under their scoring averages. The game was tied 10 times in the first half before the Clippers eked out a 62-59 lead at halftime. The Blazers shot 52% in the first half; the Clippers shot 50%. At halftime we didnt make any adjustments, Rivers said. We said somethings going to give. We either start defending or were really going to have a tough night. The Clippers outscored the Blazers 27-17 in the third. Portlands shooting dipped to 26% while McCollum had five points and Lillard two in the period. Just imposing our will on the defensive end of the floor, causing havoc that led to us scoring a lot of points, Harrell said. George and Leonard took over to start the third. They each hit 3-pointers and George had a steal and a dunk to go with a free throw from Leonard as part of a 14-3 run that gave the Clippers a 76-62 lead. The Blazers answered with seven straight points to trail by seven. Harrell dominated the rest of the quarter, scoring nine points in the Clippers 21-7 run over the end of the third and start of the fourth that extended their lead to 96-76. They basically got what they wanted in the second half and we didnt have an answer, McCollum said. George tied his season high by making 6 of 7 3-pointers, some arcing like rainbows on their way into the net. As a team, the Clippers made 17 3-pointers on 34 attempts, with Patrick Patterson scoring 15 of his 19 points on 3s. It just shows how deep they are, how many guys they can turn to and how much production they get across the board that Patrick Patterson can come in and have a big night and Montrezl Harrell can come in and have a big night, Lillard said. When you double-team or you trap and they kick it out, theyre throwing the ball out to guys who can play. Patterson and George connected on back-to-back 3-pointers in the fourth before George and Leonard sat down for good with 3:57 remaining. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Gary Trent Jr. (right hamstring strain) missed his fourth straight game. ... They had won six of their last eight against the Clippers, including two of three at Staples Center. Clippers: JaMychal Green (tailbone contusion) sat out after getting hurt on Sunday. GASOLS FUTURE The Blazers waived Pau Gasol two weeks ago and hes returned to his native Spain. But hes still got a future with the team. Coach Terry Stotts said Gasol will join the Blazers coaching staff at some point in the future. Hes a Hall of Fame guy, he can be a mentor to all the players, Stotts said. He can speak to a lot of different players about a lot of different things. Gasol never played a game with the Blazers while recovering from surgery on his left foot in May.","401160947"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Devonte Graham made 10 3-pointers and scored 33 points, and the Charlotte Hornets spoiled D'Angelo Russell's return to the court with a 106-91 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night. Graham was 10 of 16 from beyond the arc and also dished out nine assists and had seven rebounds for the Hornets (9-14), who stopped a two-game slide. Backcourt mate Terry Rozier added 25 points, seven assists and seven rebounds as the Hornets built a 19-point, second-half lead and hung on. Russell finished with 18 points on 7-of-13 shooting in 25 minutes after missing the last nine games with a right thumb sprain. Russell did most of his damage in the first half, scoring 15 points. He started to heat up in the second quarter, scoring eight points on three straight possessions. He beat Graham with a quick drive from the wing and drew a foul for a three-point play, knocked down a 3 from the top of the key and then scored on another drive down the middle of the lane to help the Warriors claw back to within four at halftime. The Warriors (4-19) have lost four straight on their current road trip. TIP-INS Warriors: Eric Paschall entered the game as the first Warriors rookie to score in double figures 11 straight games since Klay Thompson. He finished with 16 points. ... Draymond Green played one night after having his jersey retired at Michigan State. Hornets: Swept the two-game season series. ...

"DETROIT -- Giannis Antetokounmpo was ready to go toe-to-toe with Blake Griffin during a second-quarter flare-up between division rivals Milwaukee and Detroit. The game was turning contentious. It wouldn't stay close for long. ""They're just a great defensive team and just play really physical,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""They want to be physical, they want to be dirty. They want you to get out of your game, and whenever you come in Detroit, you expect that."" Antetokounmpo scored 35 points to lift the Bucks to their 13th consecutive victory, 127-103 over the Pistons on Wednesday night. The last time the Bucks had a longer winning streak than this was when they won 16 in a row spanning the end of the 1972-73 season and the beginning of 1973-74. They also had a 13-game run shortly after that 16-game streak ended. Milwaukee won all eight matchups with the Pistons last season -- four in the regular season and four in the first round of the playoffs. The Bucks also beat Detroit last month in their first meeting of 2019-20. There were six technical fouls in this game, and there were words exchanged during a couple of mild altercations. The first involved Antetokounmpo and Griffin after those two collided around midcourt in the second quarter. ""There's going to be a lot of teams that are going to come out and try to be physical with me -- try to hit me, knock me down to the floor,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I just got to keep my composure."" In the third quarter, Antetokounmpo fell to the floor after being fouled, and then Griffin stepped over him. Milwaukee's Khris Middleton came over to confront Griffin. Three technicals were assessed after that. ""At first, I was trying to ... talk back, let them know that this is more than basketball. We can stop playing basketball and we can fight,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""At the end of the day, my teammates want me in the game, my teammates want me to keep my head in the game and I was like, whatever. At this point, whatever."" That emotions were running high was no surprise to Pistons coach Dwane Casey. ""That's going to happen. In a competitive game, it's going to happen,"" Casey said. ""If anything, that should get you more focused, more riled up, more ready to play, more ready to compete and more ready to be physical and finish at the rim. All those things you have to do in a competitive game like that, a physical game like that."" The Bucks went on a 13-2 run late in the second quarter to lead 57-39, and although Detroit closed to within 11 at the half, the Pistons never made a major run during the final two quarters. Antetokounmpo scored 12 points in the third, and Milwaukee led 92-72 after three. ""I liked our fire in the second quarter. I liked our fire in general,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think the guys, they're in a good place. They're playing good basketball. So we'll keep it going."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 14 rebounds for Detroit. Middleton had 17 points for the Bucks. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had led start to finish in each of its previous two games, but the Bucks trailed 24-22 after the first quarter in this one. Pistons: Detroit came into the game shooting a league-leading 39.9% from 3-point range. The Pistons went 11-of-36 (30.6%) on Wednesday. ... The Pistons were without G Luke Kennard (knee). G Reggie Jackson has played only two games this season because of a lumbar stress reaction. The team announced Tuesday that he'll be evaluated again in a couple of weeks. BLOWOUTS This game probably became a bit more anticipated after the Pistons routed their previous two opponents by 34 and 33 points. But the Bucks had won their previous two by 41 and 44, and this one wasn't close, either. ""They're at the top of the league, really, for a reason,"" Griffin said. ""It was a good test for us, the second time we played them on the second night of a back-to-back. But we've just got to be better.""","401160949"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  After spending most of the season struggling to find ways to win despite an inconsistent offense, scoring suddenly seems to come easily for the Orlando Magic. On Wednesday night, the Phoenix Suns witnessed that shift firsthand. Aaron Gordon scored a season-high 32 points, Terrence Ross had 22 and the Magic beat the Suns 128-114 at Amway Center. Evan Fournier added 21 points, and Markelle Fultz had 13 points, five assists and four rebounds for the Magic. Frank Kaminsky led the Suns with 23 points and five rebounds, and Devin Booker had 17 points and five assists. The Suns led by 10 points in the first half on the strength of a hot start from Kaminsky. He made nine of his first 10 shots and had 21 points by halftime. Gordon made a pair of 3-pointers to jump start a 14-1 run early in the third quarter. Fournier added a 3-pointer to punctuate the scoring spree, giving the Magic a 79-62 advantage. Gordon was 5 for 5 from 3-point range after entering the game shooting 28.4% from long range. ""Nobody expected him to shoot like that,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""But he's a good player, and you tip your hat to him. I thought we did not respect him enough."" ""It's just about relaxing and shooting my shot,"" Gordon surmised. That hot shooting trend held true for many of his teammates as well. After failing to shoot 50% from the field in any of its first 19 games, Orlando topped that mark for the second time in two nights. The Magic shot 57.6% from the field, topping their then season-best 51.1% in a 127-120 victory at Washington on Tuesday night. They scored more than 125 points for the second consecutive outing, a feat they have accomplished only two other times in franchise history. ""Our No. 1 weakness so far this year has been 3-point shooting. I believe we were 30th,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said of his team, which actually entered the game 29th in the NBA at 32.1% from 3-point range. ""Last year, I think we were 11th. We have good shooters getting into rhythm, and they're starting to shoot the ball better."" TIP INS: Suns: The Magic's 57.6% shooting was the worst defensive showing of the season for Phoenix, topping the 57.3% it allowed in a loss at Washington on Nov. 27 .... G Ricky Rubio started despite an injury to his left hand sustained on Monday night at Charlotte. Magic: G Michael Carter-Willams did not play due to a nasal contusion sustained when he caught an elbow from Washington's Bradley Beal on Tuesday night ... F Al-Farouq Aminu (torn right meniscus) is awaiting word on whether he will need surgery. FOUL TREATMENT: Booker spent several minutes on the bench receiving treatment on his back after taking a hard fall while scoring a layup that gave his team a 20-14 lead. He ultimately returned before halftime, but his coach was displeased a foul was not called on the play. ""He's tough. You guys have seen him,"" Williams said. ""I don't think he gets enough respect from the referees. What do you have to do? Get a tech, go act like you don't have any sense, for a guy to get a foul? That was a foul. We don't need to go to the league and have a conversation with them about it. That was a foul."" MORE FROM MO: While Gordon's torrid shooting pace stole the show, Mo Bamba quietly put together a double-double, finishing with 10 points and 11 rebounds in less than 19 minutes of action. His success on the glass helped lead the Magic to a 45-29 advantage in total rebounds. ""Tonight might have been his best game,"" Clifford said. ""He's in a routine and he does a good job with it. He's made good progress since last year.""","401160950"
"ATLANTA --  On a team that's undergone a full roster rebuild and endured significant injuries, Garrett Temple knew the Brooklyn Nets would need extra time to mesh. ""We had so many new guys,"" Temple said. ""On this team, our defensive principles are a little different than around the NBA. We have a very unique game plan a lot of the times. We are doing a great job out there, and guys are buying in."" Temple scored a season-high 27 points, Spencer Dinwiddie had 18 of his 24 in the second half and the Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 130-118 on Wednesday night. Taurean Prince finished with 23 points against his former team and Jarrett Allen had 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Nets, who were coming off a three-point home loss Sunday to Miami but have won six of eight despite not having injured stars Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Caris LeVert. Trae Young had 39 points and 10 assists and rookie Cam Reddish scored a career-high 25 points for Atlanta. The Hawks have lost 11 of 12. Reddish drove for a fast-break layup to cut the lead to eight with 8:49 remaining. But after a Nets timeout, Dinwiddie drove the left side for a basket that pushed the lead to 102-92, and Brooklyn wasn't threatened again. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce blamed his team's weak defense for the loss. ""We have to be into the ball a little bit more with pressure,"" Pierce said. ""We have to pressure their passers. It's whoever is on the court has to do a little bit better with regards to their responsibility."" Joe Harris' no-look pass from the top of the key to Allen for a dunk completed a 13-5 run that gave Brooklyn a 117-101 lead with 4:38 left in the game. The Nets took their first double-digit lead early in the third on Temple's 3. Dinwiddie went into attack mode, prioritizing drives to the lane that resulted in three baskets and two free throws that made it an 11-point lead. Harris scored inside to make it 80-67, and DeAndre Jordan pushed the lead back to 13 with a follow shot that caused a Hawks timeout. Dinwiddie quickly added another inside basket for his 12th point of the third to make it 86-75. Brooklyn matched his its previous high in offensive rebounds -- 18 against Indiana on Oct. 30 -- late in the third. The Nets led 56-47 at halftime. They outrebounded Atlanta by 12 and outscored the Hawks 17-7 in second-chance points before intermission. ""Dominating on the glass -- that's been a sticking point for us,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We've talked a lot about rebounding the last couple of days, how much that's hurt us. Collectively, I thought we got on the boards. Even in the first half when we were missing shots, I thought we cleaned up a lot of misses and it was a difference in the game."" TIP-INS Nets: Irving missed his 10th straight game with a right shoulder impingement and did not make the two-game road trip to stay home and rehab. ... Brooklyn has won five straight in the series and four in a row in Atlanta. ... The Nets had 10 of their 26 assists in the fourth. Hawks: F Kevin Huerter, returning after missing 11 games with a left rotator cuff strain, was on a 15-minute limit and was scoreless. ... F De'Andre Hunter, sidelined by a dislocated right index finger, missed his first game. DeAndre' Bembry started in his spot and had two points. ... G Allen Crabbe was out with right knee soreness. LAST MAN STANDING With the firing of New Jersey Devils coach John Hynes, Atkinson has the longest tenure of any coach or manager of a major pro sports team in the New York metropolitan area. This is the former Hawks assistant's fourth season. ""Coaching's a tough business,"" Atkinson said. ""I really don't know what to say. I don't know if it makes me proud or sad for the other guys but it's a tough business to survive in. Especially in New York."" HE'S BACK Prince received some warm applause after the Hawks showed a video tribute early in the first quarter to recognize his three seasons in Atlanta. The Nets acquired Prince in a June trade for Crabbe and a second-round pick. Prince starts at forward and is Brooklyn's fifth-leading scorer with a 13.0 average. Prince had no trouble getting movitated. ""One hundred percent,"" he said. ""Especially being the team that traded me away.""","401160951"
"BOSTON --  Jaylen Brown banked in a 3-pointer and blew a kiss to a former teammate. He wanted to remind old friend Kelly Olynyk that he can shoot from the outside. Brown scored a season-high 31 points, Kemba Walker had 28 and the Boston Celtics beat the Miami Heat 112-93 on Wednesday night. ""That was for Kelly. I don't know if he was over there,"" Brown said of his kiss. ""That's my guy. That was all love right there. I was showing some love. He said I was going to miss, so I sent some love over to him."" Brown said he's shown others ""some love"" after key shots. ""People say I'm a non-shooter when I make it, I guess that's my gift over to them,"" he said, smiling. Jayson Tatum added 19 points to help Boston improve to 8-0 at home. Brown connected on a season-high five 3-pointers, and Walker had seven assists and four rebounds with six shots made from beyond the arc. Jimmy Butler led the Heat with a season-high 37 points and had six rebounds and four assists. Olynyk, who played his final of four seasons in Boston with Brown, added 12 points, and Duncan Robinson and Justise Winslow each had 10. Miami had won three in a row. ""We didn't play together on either end -- defense, offense,"" Butler said. ""That's not how we've been winning games. That's one that we really wanted to win. I felt like we could have proved to ourselves how we're a good basketball team. I feel like we took a step back. Back to the drawing board."" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra left the team in the morning, flying home to be with wife Nikki for the birth of their second son. Assistant coach Dan Craig ran the team. ""Obviously, it was a big adjustment. You're going from that assistant chair to the head coach chair,"" Craig said. ""I'm just trying to juggle all that dynamics of what the head coach has to deal with before the game, in game, after game."" Brown hit two 3-pointers and Semi Ojeleye had one -- all coming from the left corner directly in front of the Heat bench just over a minute apart -- during a 9-1 spurt that pushed Boston's lead to 80-67 late in the third quarter. The Celtics led by 13 after three quarters. Boston then scored the first seven points of the fourth, making it 89-69 on Carsen Edwards' 3 from the right wing. Brown later banked in his 3 from the top of the key, making it 102-79 with 5:16 to play. TIP-INS Heat: Craig spent his high school years living about 40 minutes away from TD Garden in Chelmsford and rooting for the Celtics. ""It worked out kind of funny,"" he said before the game. ""I'm back home and I'm going to coach this game. It's pretty exciting."" Craig also ran the team in March of 2018 when Spoelstra was away for the birth of his first son. The Heat also lost that game. Celtics: Guard Marcus Smart missed the game due to illness. Coach Brad Stevens said he would have been ""doubtful"" with a sore oblique, but ""the illness knocked him out"" of playing. BEATING THEIR STRENGTH The Heat entered ranked second in the league defending the 3 at 31.2%, but Boston hit 16 of 41, connecting at a 39% mark. ""Our guys did a really good job of driving, kicking, moving the ball and finding the next guy,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""It all works together."" LEAD ERASED The Heat led by 11 points midway into the second quarter before the Celtics closed the half by scoring 26 of the final 33 points. Walker had nine of the points and Tatum eight in the spree over the final 7:09, including two shots from beyond the arc.","401160952"
"CHICAGO --  Although closing out games remains a struggle, the Chicago Bulls have hung on to win two straight after several losses in similar situations earlier in the season. Zach LaVine scored 25 points, Wendell Carter Jr. had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and Chicago beat the short-handed Memphis Grizzlies 106-99 on Wednesday night after nearly losing a 22-point lead. Lauri Markkanen had 15 points as the Bulls won consecutive games for the first time. Monday in Sacramento, the Bulls had a 19-point lead reduced to two late before winning 113-106. ""We gave up our lead again, but just like we did in Sacramento, we made big plays down the stretch,"" LaVine said. ""We kept our composure."" While happy with the wins, Chicago coach Jim Boylen hopes for more consistency to avoid the wild swings. ""We play good basketball for 12, 15 minutes, then we play five minutes of poor basketball,"" Boylen said. ""Then it flips. Now we've got to get back and re-engage, play good basketball again. ""We're learning how to do that. You've got to handle those spurts. You've got to try to get back in the flow. I thought in the last two games, we had enough plays to do that, settle down."" Jonas Valanciunas had 32 points and 13 rebounds, and Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jae Crowder each scored 15 points for Memphis, which has dropped eight of nine. Rookie Ja Morant, the Grizzlies' leading scorer at 18.6 points per game, missed his third straight game with back soreness. ""I was doing everything that I can,"" Valanciunas said. ""We need some wins. We've got to pull some out."" The Bulls scored the game's first seven points and had a 13-2 lead after four minutes. Scoring consistently was a problem for Memphis throughout the first half. Chicago had its biggest lead at 50-28 with 3 1/2 minutes to go in the second before the Grizzlies scored the final seven points of the quarter to make it 50-35 at halftime. LaVine opened the scoring in the third quarter to make it 52-35, but Memphis then ran off eight straight to pull within 52-43. A few minutes later, the Chicago lead was down to 61-55 following a five-point possession. De'Anthony Melton was fouled on a clear-path call and sank both free throws. After the Grizzlies inbounded the ball, Crowder hit a 3-pointer. That was as close as Memphis would get in the third. The Bulls closed the quarter with a 17-5 run for a 78-64 edge heading into the fourth. Chicago was leading 82-70 with 8 1/2 minutes remaining before the Grizzlies went on a 17-6 run to make it 88-87 with 4 1/2 minutes to play. LaVine, though, answered with five quick points and Kris Dunn hit a 3-pointer with 3 minutes left to get the lead back up to 96-87. The Bulls hung on from there. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Valanciunas returned after missing the previous two games with flu-like symptoms. Before the game, coach Taylor Jenkins thought he might have to limit his center's minutes, but he played 29 minutes, more than his season average of 24.6. ""I was winded,"" he said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Indiana Pacers added to Oklahoma City's growing collection of disappointing second halves. T.J. Warren scored 24 points to help Indiana beat the Thunder 107-100 on Wednesday night. Oklahoma City led by a point at halftime, but the Pacers outscored the Thunder 58-50 after the break. ""In the second half, we did a better job on both ends of the floor getting stops, continuing to move the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""I thought that in the first half, we played in traffic a little bit, but the second half, we had better ball movement and guys were able to knock down shots."" Domantas Sabonis added 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Pacers. They have won seven of eight. Eight of Oklahoma City's 12 losses have been by seven or fewer points. The Thunder have battled the better teams on the schedule but have squandered halftime leads against the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and Milwaukee Bucks. The third quarter has been particularly tough for Oklahoma City this season. ""Everyone out there is trying to do the right thing,"" Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari said. ""Whether it's adjustments we make at halftime or they (opponents) come in with a lot more pace or more emphasis on it than we do -- we're working on it."" Steven Adams scored 20 points on 8-for-8 shooting and Gallinari and Dennis Schroder each added 18 points for the Thunder. Gallinari made four 3-pointers in the first 5 1/2 minutes of the third quarter to help put the Thunder up 64-60. The Pacers rallied, and Justin Holiday's layup with less than a second left in the third quarter put the Pacers up 79-78. Indiana led 103-100 in the final minute of the fourth quarter and Oklahoma City had a chance to tie. Terrance Ferguson missed a 3-pointer from the corner with 17 seconds left, and Warren made two free throws at the other end with 13.2 seconds to go to put the Pacers in control for good. Oklahoma City decided against calling a timeout before Ferguson's three. ""I don't think you can draw something up and get a better look than we got,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""I told Ferg I want him to shoot that every night. That's what he does for us."" The Pacers expected a tough game from the Thunder, given their tendency to play close games. ""They've got good players over there,"" McMillan said. ""They have a good team and they've been playing good basketball."" TIP-INS Pacers: Starters Sabonis and Jeremy Lamb are former Thunder players who were cheered during pregame introductions. Lamb finished with 13 points. ... Another former Thunder player, Doug McDermott, also plays for the Pacers. He scored 14 points. ... Sabonis committed three fouls in a 23-second stretch in the fourth quarter. Thunder: G Andre Roberson is away from the team while recovering from his left knee injury. He has not played for nearly two years. There is no timetable for his return. ... Lost a coaches' challenge in the third quarter. ... Paul went scoreless the first three quarters and finished with 4 points on 2-for-9 shooting. STAT LINESAfter getting off to a rough start, Adams has been hot lately. The 7-foot center made all eight of his shots on Wednesday. He has made 14 of 15 in his past two games and 21 of 26 in his past three. He's averaging 16.3 points in those three games. ""I think he's kind of getting back to where he normally was, the guy we're used to seeing,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Everything for him looks a lot better."" OFF NIGHT Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who entered the night as Oklahoma City's No. 2 scorer for the season with 18.2 points per game, finished with 16 on 7-for-19 shooting. He made just 1 of 7 3-pointers. He was shooting 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from 3-point range before Wednesday night. HE SAID IT McMillan on handling late-game situations: ""I thought they had good pressure on the ball and we had to execute. We had to make plays down the stretch, setting screens and getting the ball to the open man. Those are things we've got to do to win ballgames.""","401160954"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks showed Wednesday night they are much more than Luka Doncic. Dwight Powell scored 24 points on 9-for-9 shooting from the field, Jalen Brunson ignited a fourth-quarter rally with 14 of his 16 points in the period and the Mavericks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 121-114. Powell and Brunson both had season highs as the Mavericks won for the ninth time in 10 games. Going into the second night of a back-to-back, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said, ""Depth is going to be our calling card if we're going to be good."" Then his team went out and proved his point on a night when Doncic struggled with 8-for-22 shooting and was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter. With five reserves on the floor to start the fourth quarter, Dallas was 7-of-9 on 3s after hitting only four of its first 27. Brunson made two, including the one that put Dallas ahead to stay at 94-93 with 7 minutes to play. ""A little opportunity. A little bit of preparation. I just felt it going,"" Brunson said. Maxi Kleber made two 3s and Justin Jackson another before Doncic came back into the game and made his only 3 off an assist from Brunson to put the Mavs up 106-98. Doncic, whose frustrations with the officiating boiled over when he was given a technical foul by referee David Guthrie with 2:26 left in the third quarter, looked skyward as if to show relief when the shot swished through. Doncic finished with 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists -- all below his season averages. It was the first time since Oct. 29 -- a stretch of 17 games -- when someone other than the 20-year-old standout led Dallas in scoring. ""We have amazing players on this team,"" Doncic said. ""Anybody can do anything."" Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins had 26 points apiece for the Timberwolves, and Robert Covington added 22. ""I think we played solid through three quarters,"" Wiggins said. ""But in the fourth quarter, we let them get too comfortable."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Forward Jake Layman remains out with a sprained big toe on his left foot. Coach Ryan Saunders said Layman was not with the team as it begins a four-game trip and didn't have a timetable for his return. Mavericks: Powell's 14 first-half points were a career high in a half for the sixth-year center and he finished just two short of his career high after leaving the game midway through the fourth quarter with a wrist injury. LUKA'S STREAK Calling this a below-average game for Doncic only emphasizes the impressive numbers he's put up in his second year. He is currently riding a streak of 17 consecutive games with at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists. That tied Russell Westbrook's streak as the second-longest since the ABA-NBA merger (1976-77). Only Michael Jordan (18 games in 1988-89) has a longer streak. ""When he's on the bench, he's up, cheering on his teammates with the best of them,"" Carlisle said of Doncic. ""He was really into the game when our second unit got it going in the fourth."" ROAD WARRIORS Minnesota had won four in a row on the road and was 7-2 away from Target Center entering Wednesday. The Wolves will need more road magic with this contest starting a stretch of eight road games in 11 days, all against Western Conference teams. ""We've got to find consistency playing for 48 (minutes),"" Towns said. POWELL BRUISED Powell finished just two short of a career high in points when he had to leave the game with 4:47 left in the fourth when he injured his left arm in a collision with Wiggins and his own teammate Kristaps Porzingis. He was diagnosed with an arm contusion and X-rays were negative. ""It was just a really awkward play,"" Powell said. ""I felt like my arm got stuck in a revolving door. It didn't feel good but thankfully it's not broken.""","401160955"
"LeBron James describes what happened on his travel that the referees missed in the first quarter of the Lakers-Jazz game. (0:36) SALT LAKE CITY --  The Los Angeles Lakers had plenty of energy left for the second night of a difficult back-to-back. Anthony Davis scored 26 points, LeBron James added 20 points and 12 assists for his 17th double-double in 22 games, and the Lakers dominated on both ends of the court in a 121-96 victory over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. A night after winning in Denver, the Lakers pushed the pace on offense and closed down passing lanes and contested shots even while leading by double digits throughout the second half. ""We knew we had to bring energy,"" James said. ""Even with a back-to-back, we still got to have energy and we got to push the pace. We're very good when we get stops and we run. ... It's very important for us to push the pace, but it starts with our defense and we got defensive stops."" Rajon Rondo paced a strong bench effort with 14 points, and season highs of 12 assists and eight rebounds. The Lakers burned the Jazz repeatedly in transition, outscoring Utah 32-5 in fast-break points. Much of that came as a result of high-energy defense. Los Angeles totaled 21 points off 19 Jazz turnovers. ""We've got a good team,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have high aspirations. We're trying to keep a game-to-game, stay-in-the-moment focus throughout the year."" Donovan Mitchell scored 29 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 23 for Utah. The Jazz lost for the fifth time in six games. Utah shot 45.2% from 3-point range but forced just seven turnovers -- a season-low for the Lakers -- and allowed Los Angeles to shoot 51% from the field and 48% from 3-point range. ""At the beginning of the year there was a determination and a focus defensively, and it showed,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""More recently, we've allowed other things, whether it be a missed shot, perception of a bad call, a turnover -- everything is lingering. Our inability to get to the next play has hurt our defense."" The Jazz opened the game with baskets on four straight possessions and took an 11-5 lead. Bogdanovic got things going with back-to-back 3-pointers. Utah eventually cooled down. Los Angeles did not. Behind a 9-0 run, the Lakers surged out to a 30-20 lead. Davis scored back-to-back baskets to punctuate the run. Los Angeles was just getting started. The Lakers used a 16-4 run, sparked by a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter from Kyle Kuzma, to stake out a 46-30 lead early in the second quarter. James fueled the bulk of the run with three baskets over a minute. ""We've got to come in and look at ourselves in the mirror, and there's stuff we've got to do better,"" Mitchell said. ""We've got to hold each other accountable when it's necessary."" Los Angeles maintained a double-digit lead throughout the second half. The Lakers led by as many as 25 points after halftime. Utah shot 50% from the field in the third quarter and trimmed the deficit to 68-57 on a runner from Jeff Green. That's as close as the Jazz got. Los Angeles countered with a 10-2 run capped off by JaVale McGee's alley-oop dunk to go up 78-59 midway through the quarter. ""We've been struggling coming out in the third quarter, giving teams more life,"" Davis said. ""We gave it up a little bit tonight and then we kind of found it again."" TIP-INS Lakers: Dwight Howard made his first 3-pointer of the season with 6:25 left in the fourth quarter. ... Los Angeles outscored the Jazz 52-34 in the paint. . The Lakers are 12-1 this season when outscoring their opponent in fast-break points. Jazz: Mike Conley missed his first game of the season (left hamstring tightness). Mitchell started at point guard in Conley's place with Joe Ingles starting at shooting guard. ... Rudy Gobert had 10 rebounds. BLOCK PARTY Davis finished with three blocked shots. All three blocks came during the third quarter. His first one provided the biggest highlight when he ran past Bogdanovic, changed direction, and recovered to block the Jazz forward's attempted 3-pointer. Davis made a tough play look simple and, in the process, summed up for his teammates where he is at defensively early in the season. ""It's not hard (to block that shot) when you're defensive player of the year,"" James said. STREAK BUSTED It was James' first win in Utah since Dec. 8, 2010.","401160956"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  CJ McCollum was confident it would all start to come together. McCollum scored 33 points and the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away in the final quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 127-116 on Wednesday night. It was McCollum's 10th straight game with 20 or more points, tying a career high. That's a trend upward from the start of the season, when he struggled in a few games. I know who I am as a basketball player. I know what I'm capable of doing. My body of work proves itself, it shows who I am as a basketball player,"" he said. So if I have two or three poor games, poor shooting nights, I don't get discouraged because it's an 82-game season. Hassan Whiteside added 22 points and 16 rebounds, as well as a career-high seven assists. Damian Lillard had 24 points and 10 assists in Portland's third straight win at the Moda Center. Carmelo Anthony finished with 20 points, his fourth game with 20 or more in seven games with the Blazers. Richaun Holmes had 28 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings. They made some shots to kind of break our backs there in the fourth quarter but I feel like we competed all the way through, Holmes said. Kent Bazemore's corner 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 108-101 lead early in the final quarter. Lillard's 31-footer made it 113-105 with 6:46 left. Bazemore had another 3-pointer that gave the Blazers their biggest lead of the game to that point, 119-108 with 4:28 remaining. The Blazers were playing the second of a back-to-back. They lost on the road to the Clippers 117-97 on Tuesday night, snapping a three-game winning streak. Portland has been boosted by the addition of Anthony, who was chosen the Western Conference player of the week for averaging 22.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists over the three-game winning streak. Anthony's strong return after being out of the NBA for more than a year has been a surprise to some. But the 10-time All-Star seems to have meshed well in Portland. Sacramento was without guard Bogdan Bogdanovic because of a knee contusion. He's also dealing with a hamstring injury. Bogdanovic is averaging 14.8 points, 2.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists this season. A 10-0 run at the end of the first quarter put the Kings up 28-26 but Anthony's jumper ended it. Buddy Hield had 14 points as Sacramento closed out the period ahead 35-30. McCollum made four straight field goals for 10 points, pulling Portland within 43-42. The Blazers had a 66-64 lead at the half, led by McCollum with 23 points. He also had career-high four blocks, all in the first half. McCollum's 3-pointer gave the Blazers an 83-80 lead. Anthony added another 3 to extend it. Sacramento kept kept it close and briefly re-took the lead, but Portland led 100-95 heading into the final quarter. Lillard said the team tightened up its defense in the final quarter. I think it was obvious that it wasn't good enough the first three quarters or so. The fourth quarter, we stepped it up and that was when we won the game, he said. Portland has won 12 straight over the Kings at the Moda Center. It was the third of four meetings between the teams this season. They split the previous two. TIP-INS Kings: The Kings continue to play without DeAaron Fox (ankle) and Marvin Bagley III (thumb), although Bagley is expected to return soon.  You don't want any of your guys to get hurt, but a lot of what we built we built around having certain guys, and they haven't been with us,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. That's why I go back to giving our guys credit. They've adjusted, they've adapted, continued to work. ... It was the first of a four-game road trip for the Kings, who play their next three in Texas. ... Hield finished with 23 points. Trail Blazers: It was the start of a four-game homestand for Portland. ... Whiteside's double-double was his 13th this season. ... Anfernee Simons fouled out with 11:17 left in the game. It was the first time he'd fouled out in his NBA career. ... Blazers coach Terry Stotts said Rodney Hood was bothered by an Achilles injury. Hood finished with six points. ABOUT THOSE BLOCKS McCollum finished with four, a career high. I'll be at the rim every now and then. Being a rim protector, helping people's fantasy teams,"" he joked.","401160957"
"WASHINGTON --  Well, at least give Ben Simmons and the rest of the Philadelphia 76ers credit for honesty. They didn't try to hide from the fact that they were sloppy with the ball -- to the tune of 21 turnovers, a combined 15 from Simmons and Joel Embiid -- or that their defense was half-hearted -- they let one opponent make his first half-dozen 3-point attempts -- or that their overall showing was, to use Tobias Harris' word, Terrible. As well as the Sixers have been playing at home lately, they just can't consistently get their act together on the road, and the latest disappointment for a team that has serious aspirations for the postseason was a 119-113 loss at the struggling Washington Wizards on Thursday night. I just think, Simmons said, we came in too relaxed. The Sixers dropped to 5-7 away from Philadelphia -- where they are 10-0 this season -- despite 33 points from Harris, 26 points and a season-best 21 rebounds from Embiid, and 17 points and 10 assists from Simmons. I didnt think we responded well at all. I thought that it took us about 36 minutes, 38 minutes, to come with an energy that we have been playing with,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Facing one of the most lax defenses in the NBA, Embiid had eight turnovers and Simmons seven. The Wizards ended up converting all of the turnovers into 30 points, quite a gift for a team that lost five of six games entering the night. There was just a lot of bad turnovers all around, Harris said. Its something thats been hurting us all year. Weve known that. Rookie Rui Hachimura scored 27 for Washington, Bradley Beal had 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Davis Bertans scored 19 of his season-high 25 points in the second quarter. In the first half, he shot 8 for 8 overall, 6 for 6 on 3s, and totaled 22 points. ""Hes the best shooter that Ive ever seen,"" Hachimura said. The 76ers have lost 10 games in a row at Washington; their last victory in the nation's capital came on Nov. 1, 2013. Still, the Wizards started this one about as poorly as possible at the offensive end, missing their first five shots and turning the ball over twice before finally making a basket after nearly 4 minutes. Raul Neto hit 3s on consecutive trips down the court to put the Sixers ahead 33-22 late in the first quarter. Bertans took over in the second, though, scoring 12 points in a row for Washington in one stretch and sparking a 16-2 run. Kind of a punch in the face for them, Bertans said. TIP-INS 76ers: Had won eight of their last nine games. ... G Josh Richardson missed his fourth consecutive game because of right hamstring tightness. A hamstring is one of those things where you think that youre fine and you take one wrong step and its a week or two-week setback, Richardson said. ""I dont really want to get in that whole scenario. ... Made 8 of 14 attempts on 3s in the first half, 5 of 14 in the second. Wizards: Washington got back two reserve centers Thursday after injury absences: Ian Mahinmi (right Achilles) made his season debut, getting seven points and five rebounds in 13 minutes; Moe Wagner (left ankle) returned after missing two games and had five points and 11 rebounds. SO MANY INJURIES Washington's roster has been injury-depleted all season so far, most prominently missing All-Star point guard John Wall. Each day seems to bring more bad news, and Thursday was no different: Point guard Isaiah Thomas was a late scratch with a bad calf, while guard-forward Jordan McRae was ruled out for no less than two weeks because of a right finger problem. Others unavailable at the moment include starting center Thomas Bryant and forward C.J Miles.","401160958"

Denver's backups scored 74 points, with five double-digit scorers. ""We know our second unit is huge for us,"" Nuggets reserve Juancho Hernangomez said. ""We know what we can do.

""I thought that group as great. Everyone contributed. Everyone stepped up. So, it's a good way to start off the road trip."" The Nuggets used a 17-1 run to take a 67-45 halftime lead. Mitchell Robinson had 17 points and Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis each added 10 for New York. The Knicks have lost eighth straight. Denver led by 43 points in the fourth quarter.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Monty Williams was able to celebrate a victory in an emotional return to New Orleans. The former New Orleans coach guided the Phoenix Suns to a 139-132 overtime victory over the Pelicans on Thursday night. Devin Booker broke out of a perimeter-shooting slump, scoring 21 of his season-high 44 points in the third quarter, and Ricky Rubio powered the Phoenix Suns with four points and a critical assist in overtime. Williams and late wife Ingrid raised five children in New Orleans and built a core of friends despite the team's mediocre results through his final season in 2014-15. When Ingrid was killed in a car wreck in 2016 in Oklahoma City, where Williams had become an assistant coach, it was Williams' friends in New Orleans who helped him cope with the loss of his spouse. ""It's a big win to come back here for the first time as a head coach and win in overtime,"" Williams said. ""I hate those situations because I was sweating like you know what, but it was pretty cool to come back here and win. And, now, I get to go outside and see some people who really care about me."" Williams thought it might have been a pushover when the Suns led 105-85 early in the fourth quarter. But playing the back end of a back-to-back, Phoenix seemed to lose energy and the Pelicans fought back with five 3-pointers, two by the normally scatter-shooting Lonzo Ball, to tie it at 125. The Pelicans had a chance to win in regulation, but Brandon Ingram missed a 15-foot jumper from the right baseline as time expired. In overtime, Ingram's conventional three-point play tied it at 129, but Ricky Rubio hit a 12-footer and a scoop in the lane and then added a no-look assist to put the Suns up 135-129. Rubio finished with 15 assists. New Orleans got to 135-132 on JJ Redick's 3-pointer with 56.5 left, but Frank Kaminsky, who had six points in the overtime, iced it with two free throws. Kaminsky finished with 20 points, and Kelly Oubre had 14 points and 15 rebounds. Booker made Williams' homecoming successful. ""Just recently in the past three games we've been slow out of halftime,"" Booker said. ""We made it a point at halftime that coming out we needed to be better, so I just tried to out my foot down on that, come out with energy and be aggressive, and it worked well for us."" The Suns led 74-70 at halftime and then took control by opening the third quarter on a 16-3 run. New Orleans, which lost its seventh consecutive game, had four players with at least 20 points: Redick with 26, Jrue Holiday with 23, Ingram with 21 and Ball with 20 and 11 assists. ""I thought we did a good job,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said bounced back. It was our defense. We were locked in, and we were guarding."" TIP-INS Suns: Aron Baynes sat out with a left calf strain. Pelicans: Executive vice president David Griffin said the team will be exceedingly careful with No. 1 pick Zion Williams, who has been sidelined for six weeks since arthroscopic knee surgery. ""If we get outside the eight weeks, it's because he didn't meet the (knee-strength) metrics,"" Griffin said.","401160961"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Seven months ago, Brooklyn Nets sharpshooter Joe Harris won the NBA All-Star Weekend 3-point contest at the Spectrum Center. On Friday night, Harris was at it again by scoring 22 points and hitting six 3-pointers as the Nets continued their recent strong play in road games with a 111-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The Nets (12-10) won for the fifth time in their last six road games, all while playing without injured point guard Kyrie Irving. DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 13 rebounds, Taurean Prince also scored 16 points, while Jarrett Allen had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie finished with 12 assists. ""Yeah, you know it's a little bit different set up than the 3-point contest but tonight the ball was moving early. A lot of guys were knocking down shots and shooting is kind of one of the things where it's contagious,"" said Harris, whose team hit 15 of 38 3-pointers overall. ""You know, once guys start seeing it go down, everybody else starts to feel that and we had a lot of confidence early shooting from 3."" Charlotte controlled much of the opening half, twice building seven-point leads before taking a 57-55 lead into the break. In the third quarter, the Nets built a 75-66 lead with 4:41 left. Brooklyn took its first double-figure lead at 95-84 after Theo Pinson's three-point play with 7:36 to play before leading by as many as 14 points. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson liked his team's offensive efficiency but felt his team's defense at the start of the fourth quarter led by his backups sealed the victory. ""Just that second unit I thought was fantastic,"" said Atkinson, whose team limited Charlotte to 20 fourth-quarter points. It ""started with Shump (Iman Shumpert) and then David Nwaba, I thought it was really good and then DeAndre Jordan was incredible tonight. They really picked it up and got our energy going. It really turned the game. Again, I thought that Shump was key there."" Now winners of seven of their last nine overall, Atkinson thought that recent strong play helped the Nets' overcome a sluggish first half. ""Their chemistry is really good right now,"" Atkinson said of his team. ""They are talking about coverages, and encouraging each other. Even in the first half when it didn't go so well they were together. Sometimes coaches will get negative. (But) they are pushing each other and their chemistry is great right now."" Devonte' Graham' scored 29 points for the Hornets. Graham, Charlotte's leading scorer at 18.7 points per game, bruised his left shoulder a minute into Friday's game but returned to action in the second quarter and eventually made 8 of 19 shots, going 6 of 11 on 3-pointers. Terry Rozier III added 24 points, Cody Zeller 17 and P.J. Washington 14 for Charlotte. ""It was bothering me a little bit at first,"" Graham said of his injured shoulder. ""But I just had to stop thinking about it and just go out and hoop."" Charlotte coach James Borrego was disappointed in his team's 19 turnovers that led to 32 Nets' points. The Hornets had committed 13 or less turnovers in five of its last six games. The ""poor fourth quarter start,"" Borrego said. ""That did us in. (We) couldn't score and then we were turning it over. We were handing them points off our offense. So it was a combination. We went dry, turned it over and ... lots of the fourth quarter was not great. Then the biggest line was 19 turnovers for 32 points."" TIP-INS: Nets: Irving missed his 11th straight game witb a right shoulder impingement. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game there was no injury status update for Irving. Hornets: Entering Friday's games, Charlotte's guard duo of Rozier and Graham had made a combined 144 3-pointers. That ranked them tied for second in the NBA behind Houston's duo of James Harden and Ben McLemore (148). FANS OF FIZDALE Both Borrego and Atkinson were surprised and disappointed to hear about David Fizdale being fired as New York Knicks coach earlier Friday. Borrego has long roots with Fizdale, with whom he worked on his first coaching job in 2001 at the University of San Diego when both were assistant coaches. ""It's a tough day,"" Borrego said. ""Fiz is a friend and someone I have great respect for. It's just a tough day."" Said Atkinson: ""It doesn't make you feel good as a colleague and a friend. I know it's part of the business but he's a good coach.""","401160962"
"CLEVELAND --  The Orlando Magic spent last season climbing back to relevance. They're at it again. Terrence Ross scored 21 points, Evan Fournier added 18 and Aaron Gordon had a big dunk in the final 20 seconds to lead the Magic to their fourth straight win, 93-87 Friday night over the slumping Cleveland Cavaliers, who have dropped four in a row and 11 of 12. Orlando opened the season 2-6, but in winning five of six, the Magic, who had a 17-game improvement in 2018 after winning just 25 games the previous year, reached .500 for the first time. ""It's good we've gotten back there after the way we started, but time will tell how good we are,"" said Ross, who made two 3-pointers early in the fourth. ""We've got three tough games coming up that will test us."" The Magic face a brutal stretch over the next week, playing at Milwaukee and home against the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston. Collin Sexton scored 19 points and Cedi Osman 14 for Cleveland, which pulled within 90-87 on rookie Darius Garland's jumper with 42.5 seconds left. The Cavs needed a defensive stop on Orlando's next trip, but instead they gave up a dunk on a baseline out of bounds play with just three seconds left on the 24-second shot clock to Gordon, who managed to get free in the lane and scored over Tristan Thompson. On Cleveland's next possession, Larry Nance Jr. threw away the ball trying to hit Sexton on the opposite wing, ending the Cavs' last chance at a comeback. Orlando's surge has come without center Nikola Vucevic, who missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ""Once the big guy comes back, we'll be even more dangerous,"" Fournier said. ""We need to keep the same intensity and focus we're playing with now."" Despite another loss, first-year coach John Beilein saw enough positives to feel good about his young squad, which is going through some expected growing pains that are hurting more than expected. ""It reminded me a lot of what we were playing like at the beginning of the year,"" Beilein said. ""We were gritty. We were tough. Just played really hard, something the coaching staff has been working with them on the last couple of weeks."" Cleveland was without star forward Kevin Love, who has been battling a flu bug the past few days and stayed home to rest. The Cavs are hoping Love will be available Saturday in Philadelphia. Love recently missed three games with a bruised back and his name is already surfacing in trade rumors. CHEAP SHOTS Before the game, Beilein addressed a report that players have complained about his coaching style. The Athletic, quoting anonymous Cleveland players, said Beilein's methods are not working and they've begun tuning him out. The former Michigan coach believes he has his player's attention and said they've been receptive. ""We really had more than one of them, two, three, four we've met with and it's like, `Coach, keep doing what you're doing because we really need this. We need accountability, we need to play harder, stronger, tougher. Don't stop what you're doing."" ""I have a lot of confidence the guys in the locker room are on board, and they've told me that."" COACH'S BACKING Magic coach Steve Clifford offered his unsolicited support of Beilein. ""I've known coach Beilein longer than anybody,"" he said. ""He's a phenomenal coach and he's won at every level. This league is a tough league. All I know is he'll find a way to win. It's not easy to do and there is very little growth at any level in any team sport without any conflict. ""When a guy says something behind the scenes and they won't own it, as a coach, it gets very frustrating."" TIP-INS Magic: Gordon sat out Orlando's win over Cleveland on Nov. 27 with an ankle injury. ... F Jonathan Isaac had four of Orlando's nine blocks. ... Browns defensive coordinator Steve Wilks visited Clifford following the game. They became friends when Wilks worked for the Carolina Panthers.

"DETROIT --  Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey knew his teams fourth game against the Indiana Pacers was going to be just as physical as the first three. He also knew Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond could give the Pistons a big edge in that aspect of the game. Drummond had 25 points and 22 rebounds, Griffin scored 25 points and made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 41 seconds left, and the Pistons beat the Pacers 108-101 on Friday. We knew this was going to be a playoff-style game, and the way we played down the stretch was indicative of how we wanted to approach this one, Casey said. We were boxing out, we were hitting guys and if we got a foul, it was a hard foul. It wasnt anything dirty, just good physical basketball. Detroit led by 11 at the half, but was outscored 31-16 in the third quarter. Drummond felt it was a small victory to only trail 75-71 going into the fourth. They are a really good team and we knew they were going to get back into the game, he said. We really did a job sustaining ourselves during their run and only being down four going into the fourth. Then we played our (butts) off. The Pistons had a 25-2 edge in second-chance points, including 12-0 in the fourth quarter. Andre was a monster down the stretch, Casey said. It wasnt a pretty game, but he had 25 and 22 and what Im proud about, the second-chance points. That was huge. Derrick Rose had 14 points and set up Griffins go-ahead shot. The Pistons have won three of four. T.J. Warren scored 26 points and Domantas Sabonis added 18 points and 13 rebounds for Indiana. The Pacers lost for the second time in nine games. It was execution, Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Its always about execution. We didnt get stops when we needed them and when we did force a miss, they got the offensive rebound. The Pistons took a 99-97 lead on Luke Kennards jumper with 1:55 to play. After Malcolm Brogdon split a pair of free throws, Drummond committed his fifth foul to put Sabonis on the line. He also went 1 for 2, tying the game with 1:22 to play. Rose and Warren traded short jumpers, making it 101-all, and Griffin took a kick-out from Rose to hit the 3-pointer that gave the Pistons the lead. We practice that play all the time, using a bunch of different people, Casey said. Derrick ran it just like we drew it up. Brogdon turned the ball over under pressure from Bruce Brown and Rose iced it with a pair of jumpers. (Rose) was MVP for a reason, Griffin said. Hes very poised with the ball in hands and he doesnt get rattled, especially late in the game. The Pistons won the season series 3-1. We worked harder on the defensive end and started making some shots to get ourselves back into the third quarter, McMillan said. But I thought they were the aggressors all night long. They seemed to want it a little more and they got a 37-point fourth quarter. TIP INS Pacers: Indiana outshot the Pistons 59% to 28% as it got back into the game in the third quarter. ... Victor Oladipos knee injury means he wont play against the Pistons in the regular season. Pistons: Drummonds 20-20 game was the 37th of his career, trailing only Dwight Howard (51) among active players. WINNING THE GAME ON THE BOARDS Detroits 25-2 edge in second-chance points stemmed from their dominance of the boards on both ends. The Pistons grabbed 88% of Indianas missed shots and 33% of their own, then upped that to 90% and 60% in the fourth quarter. Theyre a really physical team, so we knew we had to bring our A game, Drummond said.","401160964"
"BOSTON --  It's been a long time since Boston fans went home unhappy. The Celtics remained perfect at home for the season, getting 26 points from Jayson Tatum and 21 from Jaylen Brown to beat the Denver Nuggets 108-95 on Friday night. Boston is 9-0 at the TD Garden, prolonging a city-wide streak in which none of the pro teams has lost a home game in regulation all fall. ""It's a special city to play in and a special city to coach in,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""Our No. 1 objective was to be a team Boston liked. Hopefully we've achieved that."" No Boston team has gone home empty-handed since the Red Sox lost to the Baltimore Orioles on Sept. 28. The Patriots are 5-0 at home this season, and the Bruins are 12-0-5. (The Revolution won their last home game on Sept. 29, and the Pride of the National Women's Hockey League are 9-0 at home.) ""Hopefully, none of us lose at home,"" said guard Kemba Walker, who scored 19 to help the Celtics win for the fifth time in six games. Nikola Jokic had 30 points and 10 rebounds for Denver, which has lost three of its last four. ""We're not playing well at all. We're playing really bad, and we are second in the West,"" guard Jamal Murray said. ""So imagine when we start playing well."" TIP-INS: Nuggets: Gary Harris hit his 500th career 3-pointer. Celtics: Stevens said injured forward Gordon Hayward will return to practice on Sunday and be ready to play before Christmas. ... Marcus Smart returned after missing one game with an oblique injury and illness. Every fan at the game received a poster of him. He had nine points in 28 minutes. ... Retired Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was sitting courtside. ... The Celtics and Nuggets were back together for the first time since Nov. 22, when Walker had a head-to-torso collision with teammate Semi Ojeleye. Walker was taken off on a stretcher, but he missed only one game with a neck injury. FIRE AND ICE Brown, who was the third overall pick in the 2016 draft, and Tatum, who went No. 3 overall the following year, have different personal and playing styles that are increasingly complementing each other on the court. ""I guess we feed off each other,"" Brown said. ""It's like fire and ice."" SLUMP BUSTER Jokic went six games without hitting a 3-pointer, missing 16 in a row dating to Nov. 20. He was 1 for 5 on Friday night, making one in the fourth quarter. In all, he was 13 for 21 from the field. ""Seeing Nikola play the way he did tonight is a small victory for us,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""I remind everybody, he set the bar so damn high last year in the playoffs that everyone expects brilliance every night and that's a lot to ask for a young kid. Tonight was an example of him getting back to who he is and playing the game."" PULLING AWAY Boston made the first two baskets of the game and never trailed, leading by as many as 10 points in the first quarter and 15 in the second. The Celtics led 74-64 with less than two minutes left in the third when they ran off the last 11 points of the quarter, including six by Brown and a step-back 3-pointer by Tatum in the final seconds. ""Me and my teammates, we didn't play very much defense,"" Jokic said. ""It seems like it was too easy for them.""","401160965"
"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler scored 28 points and had his second triple-double of the week, Bam Adebayo had a career-high 24 points and the Miami Heat beat the Washington Wizards 112-103 on Friday night. Butler finished with 11 assists and 11 rebounds for Miami, which is 9-0 at home for the first time in franchise history. Tyler Herro scored 22 points and Adebayo grabbed 13 rebounds for the Heat. Bradley Beal scored 23 points for Washington, including a 3-pointer late to get the Wizards to 95-94. Butler answered that with a 3-pointer to give the Heat some breathing room, then connected on another 3 with 1:04 left to put Miami up 111-103. Moritz Wagner had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards, while Davis Bertans scored 19 points and added nine rebounds. The Wizards took a 40-29 lead early in the second quarter -- significant because it was the first time this season that Miami trailed by double digits at home. The Heat trailed Memphis by eight in the season-opener on Oct. 23, then basically cruised in most of their other games facing nary a deficit along the way. This time, they had to work all the way to the end -- yet found a way. Duncan Robinson's 3-pointer off Butler's 10th assist put the Heat up by seven with about 3:30 left, and back-to-back jumpers by Butler essentially put the game away. The Heat trailed 65-61 at the half, then held Washington to 38 points in the final two quarters. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington has scored 100 or more points in 19 consecutive games, the franchise's second-longest streak in the last 30 years. It had a 23-game run from Jan. 3 through Feb. 24, 2017. ... Bertans has 16 games with at least three 3-pointers made this season. The only players with more are Houston's James Harden and Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns, both with 17. Heat: Adebayo's previous career best was 22. ... Butler had a special guest at the game -- his former coach in Chicago, Tom Thibodeau. ... Friday started the first of two different four-game homestands for the Heat in December. They have a season-best five-game homestand from Feb. 26 through March 4. INJURY WATCH Washington played without Ian Mahinmi (right Achilles/injury management) and Isaiah Thomas (left calf strain). The Heat were without Goran Dragic (right groin strain), Justise Winslow (back strain) and Dion Waiters (illness). Waiters still has not played this season. BABY SPO Heat coach Erik Spoelstra and wife Nikki welcomed their second son, Dante Nicholas, into the world this week. Spoelstra missed Wednesday's game in Boston but was back Friday -- with all well on the home front. ""My wife and I are thrilled. Everybody's healthy. Everybody's home,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's been a crazy 48 hours, to say the least. But we're all home and the house is a little bit louder than it was before.""","401160966"
"CHICAGO --  Draymond Green is finally getting to see Glenn Robinson III's complete game. Robinson scored the go-ahead basket and finished with 20 points to help the Golden State Warriors rally past the Chicago Bulls 100-98 on Friday night. The Warriors beat the Bulls for the second time this season, their only victories in the last nine games. Golden State escaped when Zach Lavine missed a 3-pointer in the final seconds, and Green secured the rebound. Alec Burks added 14 points, and Green had eight points, seven rebounds, and four assists. The Warriors rallied from a nine-point deficit early in the fourth quarter. Green finally tied it at 92 with a runner in the lane, and Willie Cauley-Stein had a layup to put the Warriors up 94-92 with 5:32 left. Green found Cauley-Stein for an alley-oop dunk to put the Warriors up 97-94, but Lauri Markkanen answered with a 3 for the Bulls to tie it. After Green and LaVine both split a pair free throws, Green found Robinson for another slam to give the Warriors a 100-98 lead with 1:03 left. ""I've watched him for years, dating back to his days at Michigan and even his time in the league,"" Green said. ""He was always hampered by injuries, so you kind of see glimpses here and there, but never with any consistency because he was always hurt. I think he's got an opportunity this year and he's been healthy and that's the key and he's played really well."" It took the last game of a five-game trip to get a win. ""We wanted to go home with a win and we thought it was a winnable game,"" Green said. Markkanen finished with 20 points and LaVine had 21. The Bulls had won two in a row. ""It needs to be more of the 48 (minutes),""Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""That's the development part. So as much as I like some of those moments, there are moments when we've got to do better."" Chicago's Denzel Valentine was ejected with 7:50 left for his second technical. Valentine was jawing at the Warriors from the bench when he was issued his second technical. Valentine and Omari Spellman were given double technicals late in the third quarter. Valentine finished with 11 points off the bench. He scored eight points in the second half. ""The game of basketball was taken away from me for a year (because of ankle surgery). I'm just playing with passion and emotion. And that's what I did tonight,"" Valentine said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder had found multiple ways to lose close games this season. Not this time. Chris Paul scored a season-high 30 points and Oklahoma City pulled off an improbable 139-127 overtime victory over the Timberwolves on Friday night. With Minnesota ahead 121-119 and 1.1 seconds remaining in regulation, Oklahoma City fouled Karl-Anthony Towns. He missed a free throw, then Minnesota was issued a technical foul for a delay of game because Jordan Bell did not have his jersey tucked in when he subbed in. It was a technical because the Timberwolves had been called for delay of game late in the third quarter, and a technical is given on a second delay of game. Danilo Gallinari made the technical free throw for Oklahoma City, then Towns shot his second free throw at the other end. He made it, putting Minnesota up two but giving Oklahoma City a chance at a throw-in. The Thunder would have had to scramble if Towns had missed because they were out of timeouts. Steven Adams took advantage of the unexpected opportunity and completed a nearly length-of-the-court pass to Dennis Schroder, who made a layup as time expired to force overtime. It left the Thunder celebrating and the Timberwolves stunned. ""I ain't ever been part of something like that,"" Towns said. ""I've been a part of a lot of basketball games in my life, but I've never seen something like that happen . just the execution of everything going down."" Bell was in no mood to discuss it after the game. He walked past a group of reporters and said, ""I'll save my money."" Towns said he was trying to miss the second free throw, but that -- and everything else -- went haywire in that final sequence during regulation. Oklahoma City was prepared. ""We actually practiced that specific situation a lot in practice, and to see it pay off is good,"" sad Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored 29 points. Oklahoma City outscored the Timberwolves 17-5 in the extra period. ""We knew once we made the shot, we had a lot more work to do, and we were willing to do whatever it took to win,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. Schroder scored 25 points, Adams had 22 points and 11 rebounds, and Gallinari scored 21 points for the Thunder. Jeff Teague scored a season-high 32 points, and Towns added 30 for the Timberwolves. Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said Minnesota played well enough to win. ""We're going to pick ourselves up and be better,"" he said. ""But it hurts."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Andrew Wiggins sat out with a left thumb sprain. Wiggins averages 24.9 points per game. ... Committed 13 fouls in the third quarter. ....

According to the Thunder, it was the first time that has happened for any NBA team since the Atlanta Hawks did it in 2004. ""Oh wow,"" Paul said. ""That's sick. I didn't know that.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo had plenty of time to relax and enjoy his 25th birthday Friday night against the Los Angeles Clippers. Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 11 rebounds before exiting the game with 8:56 to play and his Milwaukee Bucks ahead by 36. The Bucks went on to win 119-91 and capture their 14th straight victory. ""The fans were unbelievable tonight,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""They made me feel special. They made this day feel special. Usually a lot of people, their birthday, they celebrate, they go out, they do all that. But that's not me. That's not what I do. But the fans made it really special for me."" The reigning MVP made 11 of 20 shots and recorded his 21st double-double of the season. ""It was Giannis' birthday and we searched all over the city to find a gift and we couldn't find one, so we gave him this one,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""That's all I can come up with because we were awful."" The Bucks led by as many as 41 and extended their longest winning streak since winning 16 consecutive games over two seasons in 1973. Khris Middleton added 17 points and Pat Connaughton and Ersan Ilyasova each scored 13 off the bench for Milwaukee. Rivers pulled all of his key players out of the game with the Bucks leading 101-67 with 9:25 remaining in the fourth quarter. The group exited to the chant of ""Overrated! Overrated!"" from the Milwaukee crowd. ""We were just still stagnant at the beginning of the fourth,"" Kawhi Leonard said. ""We weren't really running anything, not executing. Coming down, taking shots early with no passes. So, I mean, I understand why he pulled us. Plus the lead was up high and we really didn't have no type of momentum."" Leonard had 17 points and Paul George added 13 for the Clippers. Friday night was the first time Leonard and Antetokounmpo faced each other since the Eastern Conference finals in May, when Leonard's Toronto Raptors beat Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in six games en route to winning the NBA championship. Leonard said the biggest difference between Antetokounmpo then and now is he's shooting the ball with more confidence. Antetokounmpo agreed. ""Obviously, yes, I'm a little more confident with my jump shot,"" he said. ""I believe in myself more. I think my teammates believe in me even more this year. But I'm just aggressive. Since the year started, I've been on a mission to help my team win every night and I think I've stayed on that path."" Milwaukee led 30-15 after the first quarter, with Middleton scoring 10 points in the opening frame. The Bucks held a 52-43 advantage at the break. After scoring 10 points in the first half, Antetokounmpo dropped 10 in the first 4:13 of the third quarter to help the Bucks outscore the Clippers 35-19 in the period. Milwaukee dominated Los Angeles inside, outscoring the Clippers 58-38 in the paint. ""They were so much more physical than us. It was not even close,"" Rivers said. JaMychal Green missed his second straight game for Los Angeles after suffering a bruised tailbone last Friday night against the San Antonio Spurs. TIP-INS Clippers: Leonard and George practiced together for the first time as teammates on Thursday in Milwaukee. ""It was nice we could run some end-of-the game stuff against live defense,"" Rivers said. ""When you messed it up, you had a chance to correct it. I could share what I was looking for and they could share what they liked. We've not had the opportunity to do that."" Bucks: Milwaukee completed the season sweep of the Clippers. Antetokounmpo was an assist shy of a triple-double (38 points, 16 rebounds) in a 129-124 win in Los Angeles on Nov. 6. Neither George nor Leonard played that night.","401160969"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Enduring a dismal start to the season allowed the Spurs to see the beauty in an ugly victory. LaMarcus Aldridge had 19 points and 13 rebounds in his return from an injury and San Antonio rallied from nine points down in the final 1:50 of regulation before beating the Sacramento Kings 105-104 in overtime on Friday night. The Kings missed four shots on their final possession of overtime, including a pair of 3-point attempts by Trevor Ariza. ""It's definitely dramatic, but a win is a win,"" Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said. ""I think it's the best way for us to understand how we need to close out game, what mistakes cause us to be in a hole where we have to fight back so hard. For the most part, as long as we get the win, that's all that matters."" San Antonio (9-14) has won three of four after losing 12 of 14. Buddy Hield had 23 points and Harrison Barnes added 19 for Sacramento, which has lost three straight. It was the Spurs' second straight overtime game. San Antonio beat Houston 135-133 in two overtimes on Tuesday. ""This is two really hard-fought wins,"" Spurs forward Rudy Gay said. ""We dug ourselves out of holes, we got it together. These are games we were losing a couple of games ago. We're just figuring a way to get these wins now."" Dejounte Murray's 16-foot jumper with 29 seconds was the go-ahead shot. Sacramento had taken a one-point lead 19 seconds earlier on Hield's 16-footer. Murray finished with 14 points, DeRozan had 15 and Patty Mills and Jakob Poeltl had 13 points apiece. Aldridge was 8 for 18 from the field in his return from a two-game absence due to a sore right thigh. He had 10 points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs rallied to win their third straight at home. The Spurs forced overtime by outscoring the Kings 11-2 in the final 1:50 of the fourth quarter. After Barnes hit a pair of free throws with 14.3 seconds left, Marco Belinelli drained a leaning 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds remaining to tie it at 100. ""I didn't lock in and pay extra attention on Belinelli,"" Hield said. ""It's on me."" DeRozan drove the lane and kicked the ball out to Belinelli, who came off a screen from Aldridge to break free from Hield. ""They executed the play really well and (Belinelli) came off wide open and he knocked it down,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He loves those situations. He always has for his whole career, so we went to him and he came through."" The teams combined for 32 turnovers and each squandered a double-digit lead in a sloppy game between teams that are each five games below .500. The Kings scored nine straight points after the Spurs tied the game at 89 with 3:44 remaining on DeRozan's third 3-pointer. Cory Joseph capped the run with a 3-pointer with 1:50 remaining. Mills had consecutive steals against Joseph that cut the Kings' lead to 98-95 with 1:13 left. ""It was a tough one for us because we felt like we had it,"" Joseph said. ""We made, including myself, a couple of bonehead mistakes at the end."" After holding Sacramento to a season low for points by an opponent in any half in building a 52-42 lead, San Antonio set a season low with 17 in the third quarter to give away the lead. TIP-INS Kings: Joseph, who played for the Spurs from 2011-15, made his 12th start at point guard for Sacramento. Joseph had seven points and an assist in 38 minutes. . Guard Bogdan Bogdanovic, who was questionable with a bruised right knee, had nine points in 21 minutes. Spurs: DeRozan had three 3-pointers in a game for the first time since April 4, 2018, when he was with Toronto. His career high is six with the Raptors. . Poeltl had three blocks, extending his streak to nine straight games with a block. It's second only to his streak of 13 straight games with a block in 2018. TIME OFF After playing 19 games since Nov. 1, Popovich was grateful the Spurs have five days off before playing again. ""We are going to give them another couple of days off like we did before this game,"" Popovich said. ""Because those 34 days, playing every other day, was really tough on them. This is a good break so we can practice on Monday and Tuesday and get some good work in and go from there.""","401160970"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  While Anthony Davis may have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, it certainly didn't show against Portland. Davis scored 39 points and the Los Angeles Lakers routed the Blazers 136-113 on Friday night. You see what he did on this road trip being sick? And hes starting to feel a lot better and I dont quite like it. I might sneeze on him a couple of times,"" said teammate LeBron James, who added 31 points. It was the 11th straight road win for the Lakers, who have lost just three games overall this season and sit atop the Western Conference standings. The game was costly for Portland. Starting forward Rodney Hood was injured in the first quarter and the team later announced that he had torn his left Achilles tendon. You've just got to keep going forward. We've got a season to play, and as disappointing as it is to lose players to injuries, we have a team, and we've got to keep competing and playing. You don't have any other choice,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Stotts was ejected late in the third quarter after angrily protesting a foul call that earned him a double technical. It was the first time that Stotts has been tossed from a game as an NBA coach. Damian Lillard, who helped pull Stotts back from the confrontation with referee Leon Wood, finished with 29 points. Portland trailed by as many as 27 in the fourth quarter. It was the first meeting of the season between friends James and Carmelo Anthony. The two shared a quick hug on the court just before tipoff. Anthony scored 15 points after the Trail Blazers guaranteed the 10-time All-Star's contract for the the rest of the season earlier Friday. Portland (9-14) got off to a slow start this season but had won four of its last five games, including Wednesday night's 127-116 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (20-3) were coming off a 121-96 rout of the Jazz in Salt Lake City on Wednesday. Davis had 26 points in that one. We have our mind set on something special. In order to reach that goal we have to stay in the moment and go game by game, Davis said. We take every game personal. We want to go out there and be the best team."" Anthony followed up a layup and a free throw with a 3-pointer to pull the Blazers ahead 18-17 midway through the first quarter. The Lakers led 39-34 after the period, led by Davis with 15 points. Rajon Rondo hit back-to-back 3 pointers to kick off a 15-0 run. Davis had 25 points at the half and the Lakers led 77-62. A pair of free throws from CJ McCollum pulled Portland within 13 points in the third quarter, but the Blazers were never able to close to within single digits. Davis' dunk extended the lead to 101-81. Lillard got the team together before the start of the fourth quarter. I just told them we're up against it. We're playing against a good team, we haven't had a great night, we're not getting anything, you know no calls for us, nothing is going in our favor, not getting the benefit of the doubt in those situations,"" Lillard said. So we're just going to have to get more aggressive. We're getting called for every touch anyway, so we might as well get physical, get aggressive and live with whatever happens, give ourselves a chance. It was the first of three meetings between the teams this season. TIP-INS Lakers: Rondo did not return to the game after halftime because of hamstring soreness. ... Los Angeles became the second NBA team to reach 20 wins this season, joining Milwaukee. ... James also had seven rebounds and eight assists before heading to the bench late in the final quarter. ... The team's 136 points were a season high. Trail Blazers: Hood left the game late in the first quarter after injuring his left leg. He was helped off the court and did not return. ... The Lakers' 77 first-half points were the most the Blazers had allowed in the half this season. ... Hassan Whiteside had 17 points and 10 rebounds for his 13th double-double of the season. FEELING MELO James was asked after the game about how he felt playing against his old friend. I cant even lie, its always special to be on the floor with a brother of mine. We got so much history, you know weve competed against each other since 2001 when it all started. In Colorado Springs, at the Junior Olympics. ... Its always great to compete. Its great to be on the same floor period. No matter if we are teammates or competing on our respective clubs, James said. DISAPPOINTMENT The Blazers locker room was somber after the game, not so much because of the loss, but because of the loss of Hood. Portland has been hit by difficult injuries this season. The team also lost forward Zach Collins to a shoulder injury. ""You hate to see one of your teammates go down to an injury like that, especially a starter, and somebody who is really a good person and having a great season, fitting in really well with our team, and a big part of what we do. You just feel for him personally more than anything,"" Lillard said.","401160971"
"DALLAS -- With Kristaps Porzingis joining Luka Doncic in the Dallas lineup this season, the Mavericks expected to be better. But Boban Marjanovic? Doncic scored 28 points in 26 minutes, Porzingis had 13 points and the 1,500th rebound of his career and Marjanovic had season highs of 15 points and 16 rebounds to help Dallas rout the New Orleans Pelicans 130-84 on Saturday. Doncic also had nine assists and six rebounds. Dallas led 64-52 at halftime. Doncic already had 20 points, and Marjanovic scored 11 points, nine in the second quarter. ""[Marjanovic] did a great job,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The group in the second quarter really did a good job of giving us a 10-point lead. He was a big part of it, getting it to him with a smaller guy on him. He was doing a lot of damage."" The Pelicans didn't get within 10 points in the second half. ""The rest of the game was just a formality,"" Porzingis said. Last season, Doncic was the NBA's rookie of the year and Porzingis was injured and didn't play after being acquired in a trade with the New York Knicks. Marjanovic, a 7-foot-4 Serbian, played for two teams before taking a 50% pay cut to sign with Dallas as a free agent. He was a force against the undersized Pelicans. ""When they elected to use [Jahlil] Okafor, that was an opportunity for us to use Boban,"" Carlisle said. ""It's hard to use him against guys like [Jaxson] Hayes because of the quickness and shooting."" Porzingis and his teammates were happy for Marjanovic. ""Can't stop Bobie,"" Porzingis said. ""He played great on the boards. He's so big, so strong. Once he gets the ball in the paint, they can't do much out there."" Marjanovic energized the crowd and his teammates. ""When you hear [the crowd] cheering for you, basically you warm up your body so fast. Blood keep going through the body, and you're not too tight anymore."" The 46-point margin was two shy of Dallas' season high against Golden State. Dallas has won five in a row to improve to 18-8. The Mavericks have won 10 of 11 for the first time since winning their only NBA championship in 2010-11. New Orleans has lost eight in a row. ""A poorly played game, a poorly coached game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Doncic, Porzingis and the other starters didn't play in the fourth quarter after the Mavericks ran up a 38-point lead at 104-66. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 14 points. Off the bench, Jalen Brunson scored 14 on 6-for-6 shooting and Seth Curry had 11. J.J. Redick led New Orleans with 15 points. Brandon Ingram and Jrue Holiday scored 14 each and Hayes had 11. TIP-INS Pelicans: Redick had a 4-point play 3:27 into the game. Only Jamal Crawford and James Harden have more career 4-point plays in NBA history than Redick. ... F/C Derrick Favors, who is on a personal leave, missed his 11th straight game. Mavericks: G Delon Wright didn't play after the first quarter because of a right adductor strain. ""Very unlikely he's playing [Sunday],"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ... C Dwight Powell was in the starting lineup after leaving Wednesday's game with an injury to his left wrist. ... Dallas scored a season-high 104 points in the first three quarters. ... The Mavericks' 40 points were the most in the third quarter this season. ... They are 10 games over .500 for the first time since 2014-15. 20, 5 AND 5 OR MORE When Mavericks G Luka Doncic grabbed a defensive rebound 23 seconds into the third quarter, it marked his 18th straight game with at least 20 points, five assists and five rebounds in a game. The only player to have done that since the NBA/NBA merger in 1976 was Hall of Famer Michael Jordan in 1976-77. Oscar Robertson had a 29-game streak before the merger.","401160972"
"RJ Barrett reacts to the first coaching move in his NBA career, saying David Fizdale's firing has opened his eyes to play harder. (1:13) NEW YORK -- The New York Knicks didn't have any close games in David Fizdale's final days, then got one right away under interim coach Mike Miller. Julius Randle's missed free throw ended their chance to win it, but just being competitive again was a good start after a rough couple of days. ""You get in those games, you've got to make another play and we just didn't make another play,"" Miller said. ""Loved the effort. That was fun."" Randle missed a free throw with 0.1 seconds left, sending New York to a 104-103 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night in the Knicks' first game since firing Fizdale. The Knicks were much more competitive under Miller than they had been in recent games under Fizdale, who was fired Friday. They chased after rebounds and loose balls throughout the fourth quarter, erasing an 11-point deficit and giving themselves a shot at overtime when Randle was fouled while trying to put back the rebound off a scramble. He calmly made the first free throw but the second was well long, sending New York to its ninth straight loss and a 4-19 record. ""It was tough. Very difficult, but we played really hard,"" Randle said. ""We gave everything that we had. Came up short, but keep doing that and we're going to win a lot of games."" T.J. Warren scored 25 points and Domantas Sabonis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Pacers. They bounced back from a loss at Detroit on Friday. ""We knew it was going to be a tough game, whether with the coach or without the coach,"" Sabonis said. ""They are a dangerous team because they play with a lot of energy and the crowd is into it."" The Knicks lost by 44 to Milwaukee and by 37 to Denver in their past two games under Fizdale and he was fired Friday after running practice. The Knicks offered no details about the decision in their news release announcing the firing, and team executives didn't speak Saturday. Players had held a team meeting Friday to discuss their outlook going forward, even before learning it would be without Fizdale. They responded with a good effort in the first game since the change but couldn't overcome their 40.6% shooting. Marcus Morris Sr. scored 25 points for the Knicks and Randle finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds. The Knicks led by two with about 4 minutes left in the third before Indiana outscored them 13-3 to end the period. Warren had a three-point play to start it and Doug McDermott had the final five points of the quarter with a 3-pointer and long 2 to make it 89-81. He made another 3 to open the fourth to make it 92-81. ""When I get to my spots I can be aggressive and productive, kind of make plays just scoring the ball and being myself,"" Warren said. ""My teammates did a great job of finding me early and getting me going."" TIP-INS Pacers: Sabonis, who had a 12-for-12 shooting game here last season, made his first five and finished 8 for 11. ... Malcolm Brogdon sat out because of an injured right hand. Knicks: Keith Bogans was added to the staff as an assistant coach after previously serving as an assistant for Westchester in the G League. The Knicks also fired assistant Keith Smart on Friday. ... G Wayne Ellington missed the game because of a sore left Achilles tendon. BACKING FIZDALE Knicks players who spoke before the game said they had good relationships with Fizdale and had spoken about the need to step up and take pressure off him. They said management discussed with them the reason for the change, but none of the players shared it. ""Fiz is one of the types of guys that will be around the league for a long time,"" Morris said. ""It didn't work out here, so be it, but we've got to keep going forward, we've got to keep getting better.""","401160973"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Ben Simmons hit another 3-pointer, and his coach wants him to keep on firing. Simmons hit his second career 3 and scored a career-high 34 points, and the Philadelphia 76ers didn't need Joel Embiid's help to rout the Cleveland Cavaliers 141-94 Saturday night. Simmons made 12 of 14 field goals, including his only 3-point attempt, and hit 9 of 12 free throws in 26 minutes to help Philadelphia improve to 11-0 at home. ""I was locked in,"" Simmons said. Simmons' jump shot -- or lack thereof -- has been a hot topic in Philadelphia. He entered the season 0 for 17 from long range. Coach Brett Brown has repeatedly said shooting is a part of Simmons' game that will develop with time. After Saturday's performance, Brown publicly upped the ante and called for more from his All-Star point guard. ""This is what I want,"" Brown said. ""I want a 3-point shot per game, minimum. ... He will be liberated. His world will open up and, in many ways, so will ours."" Embiid sat out with a left hip contusion. Darius Garland had 17 points for the Cavaliers, who have lost six in a row and 12 of 13. ""They were going downhill on us all day long,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. Philadelphia has been projected to be an NBA title contender, but the 76ers haven't been able to consistently field its starting five of Simmons, Embiid, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris and Al Horford. They have only started nine games together due to injuries and Embiid's two-game suspension for fighting Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns. The 76ers needed little more than Simmons in a dominant first half that ended with them ahead 77-36. Simmons attacked the basket often and showed off a rarely seen mid-range game when he drained an 11-foot jumper with 6:04 left in the second quarter. That had 76ers fans cheering, but it was just an appetizer for Simmons. With 3:41 left in the half, Simmons took a cross-court pass from Trey Burke and knocked down a 3 from the left wing. That send the sold-out crowd into a frenzy, and the roars continued when Simmons finished an alley-oop dunk from Burke on Philadelphia's ensuing possession. Simmons received a standing ovation at the next stoppage. ""I'm getting more comfortable learning my spots and just adjusting,"" Simmons said. ""I'm trying not to force it, trying to play the game I know how to play. Hard work pays off. Stay in the gym and keep working."" Simmons finished the tremendous four-possession sequence with assists on Philadelphia's next two trips, first to Horford for a 3-pointer and then to James Ennis III for a jumper. Finally, Simmons ended the first half scoring with a 9-foot jumper for a 41-point lead entering the break. WINNING BIG The 47-point margin of victory is tied for third-most in Philadelphia history. The club's greatest victory is a 62-point rout of the Knicks on Dec. 25, 1960 prior to the move to Philadelphia when they were the Syracuse Nationals. BACKING BEILEIN Brown knows what Beilein is going through trying to resurrect the Cavaliers, having accumulated just 47 combined wins himself over his first three seasons during Philadelphia's rebuilding process. The 76ers coach said prior to the contest that he believes Beilein is wired to be successful in the NBA after compiling 829 victories in 40 years of coaching at the college level. The coaches embraced after the game with Brown offering some words of encouragement. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland set a season low for points in a half, worse than the 40 the Cavaliers scored against Orlando on Dec. 6. ... Cleveland's previous largest margin of defeat this season was 42 points, 143-101 at Dallas on Nov. 22. 76ers: Richardson (right hamstring tightness) missed his fifth straight contest.

"HOUSTON --  On a night where James Harden's shots weren't falling for three quarters, the Houston Rockets got big performances from those in supporting roles until the star stepped up late to close out the victory. Harden scored 18 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter and Ben McLemore added 27 points to help the Rockets outlast the Phoenix Suns 115-109 on Saturday night. Harden had a tough shooting night through three quarters and was 5 of 19 overall and 1 of 10 on 3s with 16 points before getting going in the fourth. The game was tied with about 7 minutes left, and he scored all of Houston's points in a 13-6 run that made it 102-95. That's how deep we are, Harden said. We have a really good team and guys that can make plays and knock down shots. More importantly we were focused on our defense. Russell Westbrook had 24 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his third straight triple-double and sixth this season. Harden finished 8 of 27, 3 of 17 on 3s and made 15 of 18 free throws. Devin Booker led the Suns with 35 points after scoring a season-high 44 in an overtime victory at New Orleans on Thursday night. Phoenix coach Monty Williams was proud of his team for staying in it until the very end. We have a mentality that we just don't give in, Williams said. We're playing young guys that are learning how to play against physical NBA men and that's part of developing. The Suns cut the lead to five twice in the last 90 seconds, but both times Westbrook made a layup to extend the advantage. And the second time he was fouled on the shot and made the free throw to make it 114-106. The Suns scored seven straight points, capped by a dunk from Kelly Oubre, to tie it at 85 with about 9 minutes left. After a timeout, Harden scored Houston's first points in about three minutes on a layup to put Houston back on top. It was tied again before Harden scored five points to give the Rockets a 94-89 lead. He stole the ball from Ty Jerome after that and was fouled by Booker on a drive, with Harden aggressively continuing forward and pushing Booker off the court. Harden later shoved Booker, and they both received technical fouls to the bewilderment of the Suns. Harden made both free throws to make it seven points in a row and was fouled again after he stole the ball from Mikal Bridges. Harden made one of those free throws to make it 97-89. He finds a way to win the game, Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. A lot of guys contributed. A lot of guys played well. TIP-INS Suns: Oubre had 19 points. ... Dario Saric added 13 points and 12 rebounds. ... Bridges had 14 points. ... The Suns made 11 of 35 3s. Rockets: C Tyson Chandler missed the game with flu-like symptoms. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Defense is a work in progress for Utah, and the Jazz are starting to put more pieces of the puzzle together. Utah used a strong defensive performance in the second quarter to power its way to a 126-112 victory over Memphis on Saturday night. The Jazz smothered the Grizzlies during the quarter, forcing turnovers and contesting shots with a vigor not previously seen during a road trip in which they dropped four of five games, or during a lopsided loss at home to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. Through the first 10 1/2 minutes of the second quarter Saturday night, Utah gave up just 10 points. The Jazz forced seven turnovers and scored 14 points off the miscues. It set the Grizzlies on their heels, and Memphis never really recovered. ""We got stops,"" center Rudy Gobert said. ""We raised our level defensively and we stopped turning the ball over offensively. All of a sudden, we were able to score, to get stops, to run on them. The ball was moving."" Donovan Mitchell led a balanced offensive attack with 22 points. Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Jeff Green scored 19 points apiece. Green matched his season-high. Utah shot a season-best 57% from the field and went 19 of 34 from 3-point range. Excellent ball movement produced high percentage shots through all four quarters. The Jazz had 32 assists on 45 baskets. Joe Ingles led the way with a season-high 10 assists to go along with his 10 points. Gobert (five) and Emmanuel Mudiay (seven) also finished with season highs in assists. ""We moved the ball,"" Mitchell said. ""We were all on the same page, for the most part, trying to get each other involved. That's just how we have to continue to play."" Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 26 points and Jae Crowder added 13 for the Grizzlies. Memphis lost despite forcing 22 turnovers and shooting 53% from the field. ""They came out firing on all cylinders,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""They hit 19 3s. That's hard to overcome."" The Jazz shot 60.5% and went 11 of 19 from 3-point range in the first half alone. Memphis kept pace with the Jazz in the first quarter. The Grizzlies went on a 15-5 run to take a 35-28 lead near the end of the quarter. Crowder sparked the run with back-to-back 3-pointers, drawing a foul and converting a free throw on the second. Memphis took advantage of six Jazz turnovers in the first quarter, converting them into 13 points. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, committed only two turnovers. ""They came out really physical early,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""I think as the game progressed, our level of determination to cut and move alleviated some of that."" That all changed in the second quarter when the Jazz clamped down on defense to break the game open before halftime. It opened the door for Utah to make a 20-4 run and take a 60-42 lead. Mitchell bookended the run with a layup and a 3-pointer. Green fueled the bulk of outburst with a pair of 3-pointers and a running alley-oop dunk over a two-minute stretch. ""We just missed shots, man,"" Jackson said. ""They shot really well today, it was just a couple we needed here and there. Probably taking smarter shots, maybe we used too much of the clock at times. We just missed."" Memphis cut the deficit to single digits midway through the third quarter. The Grizzlies closed within 82-75 on back-to-back baskets from Solomon Hill and Grayson Allen. Memphis never got closer than seven points. Ingles and Bogdanovic hit back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a 15-4 run. Green capped it off with another outside basket, putting the Jazz up 97-79. DISHING IT OUT Ingles made a splash in his second straight start. He became the first Jazz player to record 10 or more assists this season. Three of his assists came in the first quarter while the Jazz were trying to keep pace with the Grizzlies' hot shooting. Four came in the third quarter when Memphis attempted to rally from a double-digit deficit. ""He's starting to fall into a comfort level and I know (he showed) his ability to make plays and find people on the perimeter or finish,"" Snyder said. ""He had a great decision-making game."" WARM WELCOME Crowder received a nice ovation from the crowd during pregame introductions. He also shared a hug with Snyder in front of the Jazz bench just before tipoff. The veteran forward appeared in 107 games with Utah, making 11 starts, before a trade in July sent him, Allen, Kyle Korver, and a 2020 first-round draft pick to Memphis in exchange for Mike Conley. He averaged 11.9 points and 4.5 rebounds during his stint with the Jazz. ""Feels good to be back,"" Crowder said. ""Me and the crowd have a good relationship and left on a good note, so it felt good to get an ovation when I came back here."" TIP INS Grizzlies: Ja Morant missed his fourth straight game because of back soreness. . Crowder got a nice ovation from the crowd during pregame introductions. He played with the Jazz from 2017-19. ... Allen finished with 13 points in his first game back in Utah. He spent his rookie season with the Jazz, appearing in 38 games. ...

"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie saved the Brooklyn Nets -- again. Dinwiddie scored 24 points and the Nets held off the Denver Nuggets 105-102 on Sunday for their third straight victory. ""As long as it's working, you're all going to love me,"" Dinwiddie said. ""As soon as I miss, you're all going to hate me and tell me I'm selfish or something. We're going to keep rolling with it until that moment and I'll deal with whatever I've got to say then."" Denver had a chance to force overtime, but Jamal Murray missed a 3-pointer from the wing as time expired. Jarrett Allen added 19 points and 11 rebounds for Brooklyn. Star guard Kyrie Irving missed his 12th straight game because of a right shoulder impingement. Nikola Jokic had 24 points and 11 rebounds for Denver, and Murray scored 21 points. The Nuggets have lost two straight. Dinwiddie made consecutive driving layups to give Brooklyn a 103-102 lead with 26.3 seconds remaining. Denver's Will Barton missed a 16-foot off-balance floater, and Taurean Prince grabbed the rebound and was fouled. Prince made both free throws to make it 105-102 with 6.8 seconds left. ""It's like having an elite running back if you're an NFl coach,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said about Dinwiddie. ""You can just pitch it to him and he can go get a bucket. ... When he gets speed downhill he's basically unstoppable. Those were the two plays where he got a head of steam and you can't stop him."" Dinwiddie has scored 20 or more points in 10 of his last 12 games. For Jokic, Brooklyn's ability to get to the rim at will in crunch time was unacceptable. ""It was too easy for them,"" Jokic said. ""Second half it was too easy for them. We got to do something. I don't know what it is, but (we) probably need to do something."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Coach Michael Malone praised Paul Millsap. ""He's been the quiet unsung hero of our team,"" Malone said. ""We've had a lot of younger guys who have been up and down, inconsistent. If you looked at our first 20 games, Paul has been Mr. consistency for us, and that's what you expect from a 14-year veteran."" Millsap had nine points and four rebounds in 21 minutes.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Trae Young took a knee to the face, then returned to deliver a knockout blow to the Hornets. Young turned in perhaps his most complete game of the season with 30 points, nine assists and six rebounds and the Atlanta Hawks beat Charlotte 122-107 on Sunday night for their second victory in three games after a 10-game losing streak. ""I thought I was going to be out forever,"" a fat-lipped Young said about the blow. ""But I just cut my lip though. It felt worse than it looks."" Jabari Parker added 19 points and Vince Carter had 17 off the bench on 7-of-9 shooting to help the Hawks improve to 6-17. Center Alex Len finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds and played a big role in helping turn the tide of the game in the third quarter. But it was Young who provided the daggers. He had 20 points in the second half, including 14 in the decisive fourth quarter in which the Hawks blew open a game in which they trailed at halftime. This was Young's 10th 30-point game of the season, but only the second time the Hawks have won when he's reached that scoring plateau. ""I love it, whenever we win that's all that matters to me,"" Young said. ""If I play good and we win, I feel great. Play good and we lose, I'm mad."" ""I thought that was his best game of the year,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""He had leadership on both side of the floor. He was engaged. He was yelling out their plays and barking to us. When you're locked in on both side of the ball and leading your team, I just thought it was his best game as a floor general."" The 7-foot Len scored 11 points in the third quarter after being shut out in the first half. He played aggressive, scoring on a 3 from the top of the key, a pick-and-roll dunk from Carter and was strong on the offensive glass, helping give the Hawks a five-point lead entering the fourth quarter. From there, Young took over as the Hawks broke open the game with a 19-8 run to start the fourth quarter. Young was 5 of 7 from the field in the final quarter with two 3-pointers. Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington each had 20 points to lead the Hornets. Charlotte has lost three of four during a five-game homestand. Washington left the game midway through the fourth quarter after rolling his right ankle on a drive. Its unclear if he will miss any time. ""I just thought we were going through the motions in the second half,"" Washington said. ""It felt like we could have put them away, but we just let them hang around, they got on a run and started making shots and they just put us away."" TIP INS Hawks: DeAndre Hunter returned after missing a game because of a dislocated right index finger. He had 10 points and five assists. ... Atlanta's backups outscored Charlotte's 57-36.

Scoring leader Devonte Graham had a rough night shooting, finishing with 12 points on 4-of-17 shooting. He had eight assists. CARTER STILL HAS IT The 42-year-old Carter still has what it takes to bring the crowd to its feet. Returning to North Carolina, where he played college ball, Carter always gets a little more amped. He made one move to the basket and finished with his left hand, drawing ""ooohs"" from the crowd. ""I mean the stuff he did today was unbelievable,"" Len said. ""He had steals, was making moves, spin and step back making 3s. It was just great to see. When he was playing that way we all just picked it up and played with it like it was contagious."" KIDD-GILCHRIST RETURNS Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has spent the majority of the season on the bench, but did see his most extensive action against the Hawks and scored seven points in nearly 23 minutes. ""I was giving MKG a look,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said of the former No. 2 pick in the NBA draft. ""He's the one guy that has stayed ready. He's working and I went with him tonight instead of Nic (Batum). That's where we're at."" Batum, the team's highest-paid player at more than $20 million per season, did not play at all.","401160978"
"MIAMI --  Game on the line, perfect home record on the line, and the Miami Heat turned to their teenager. Tyler Herro came through. The rookie guard scored 27 points -- including 16 of Miami's final 18 -- and the Heat held off the Chicago Bulls 110-105 on Sunday night. They improved to 10-0 at home this season, extending the best home start in franchise history. ""I don't shy away from taking the big shot,"" Herro said. That's obvious. The 19-year-old made three 3-pointers in overtime, plus another with 7.1 seconds left in regulation just to help Miami get into the extra session. Of his five field goals in the final 6 minutes, four of them were assisted by Jimmy Butler. ""If your max player trusts you at that point in the game -- and Jimmy was looking for him -- that says all you need to know,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That trust has been earned within our walls. Jimmy has seen what this kid does in those situations."" Butler scored 23 points for the Heat, going 17 for 21 from the foul line. Bam Adebayo had 21 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for Miami, which also got 18 from Kendrick Nunn. Lauri Markkanen had 13 of his team-high 22 points in the third quarter for the Bulls, who got 18 from Zach LaVine and 16 from Kris Dunn. Markkanen missed a potentially game-tying corner 3-pointer with about 1.5 seconds left in overtime, Coby White fouled Herro on the rebound, and Miami's first-round draft pick made a pair of free throws to seal the win. ""I liked the way we fought,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""I liked the way we competed. I thought we played our (butt) off."" The Bulls fell to 1-4 in games decided by five points or less. It was tied at 97-97 after regulation, after the lead changed hands four times in the final 84 seconds. Herro's 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left put Miami up 97-95, but Butler fouled LaVine on the ensuing Chicago possession. LaVine -- an 81% foul shooter -- made both, Butler's 50-footer as the horn sounded merely hit the backboard, and off to overtime they went. From there, Herro took over. He had 11 of Miami's 13 OT points; the other two were from Nunn, another rookie. ""Definitely frustrated to lose. But we played well,"" Dunn said. ""A lot of guys played well. I thought we did the right things to put us in position to win the game. We just didn't come up with the victory."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago led by as many as 11 and held Miami without a field goal for the first 5:55 of the fourth quarter. ... Thaddeus Young, who missed Friday's loss to Golden State for personal reasons, was back with the Bulls and played off their bench. ... Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder sprain) missed his fifth consecutive game, but is improving. ""Every day his shoulder gets less sore, more loose,"" Boylen said. Heat: Butler played 44 minutes, shooting 3 for 14. ... Miami is 3-0 in overtime this season. ... Goran Dragic (groin), Dion Waiters (illness) and Justise Winslow (back) were unavailable. Waiters has not played this season and Winslow has missed 13 of Miami's 23 games. ... Adebayo -- who's been listening to pleas from Butler to shoot more 3's -- missed one in the second quarter. He's now 1 for 7 from deep this season. FOR STARTERS Miami has played 23 times this season and has yet to be beaten in consecutive games. That's a first in franchise history. QUICK WORK Bulls backup Daniel Gafford committed three fouls in an 83-second span of the first quarter, earning him a quick trip back to the bench. He checked in with 3:53 left, committed his first with 3:35 left, his second with 3:10 left and the third with 2:12 remaining.","401160979"
"PHILADELPHIA --  This victory over the Toronto Raptors didnt feel as good as it should have to the Philadelphia 76ers because of their shaky finish. Tobias Harris scored 26 points and rookie Matisse Thybulle had a career-high 20 points, including a pair of free throws with 23 seconds left, to lead Philadelphia 76ers to their 12th straight home victory, 110-104 over the Raptors on Sunday night. Ben Simmons had 16 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists a day after scoring a career-high 34 points while hitting his second career 3-pointer as the Sixers remained unbeaten at home this season. Philadelphia led by 20 points with 6 minutes left and seemed on the way to an easy victory before seven turnovers down the stretch, including turnovers by Joel Embiid on three consecutive possessions, had coach Brett Brown feeling lukewarm about the win. Where do we begin? Brown responded when asked about the finish. The way it ended left a little bit of a sour taste. Thybulle finally iced the game with a pair of free throws with 26.3 seconds left that made it 107-100. Kyle Lowry, playing in his second game after missing 11 in a row due to a broken left thumb, scored 26 points, and OG Anunoby had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. The defending champion Raptors have lost three in a row. Our rhythm wasnt great and we didnt shoot it great, Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. Embiid returned from a one-game absence due to a hip injury, finishing with 10 points and eight rebounds. Embiid was benched with 2:08 remaining after committing the three turnovers but did return to the floor. He had seven of Philadelphias 17 turnovers. He had some rough decisions, but hes one of the main reasons we won, Brown said. Something we will learn and grow from. Toronto got close late, but the Raptors had dug too big of a hole in the third quarter. Philadelphia held Toronto to 36% shooting in the first half while taking a 57-42 lead at the break. The 76ers continued to clamp down on the Raptors offense after halftime and got a big lift from the bench during a decisive third-quarter run that saw their lead grow to as many as 20 points, 73-53, on Al Horfords hook with 4:23 remaining in the period. It was 63-53 Philadelphia when Lowry made the first of two free throws with 5:51 left. Then, Thybulle sandwiched a pair of 3-pointers around a James Ennis III layup before Horfords shot that capped a 10-0 run over 1:28. Simmons put the exclamation point on the quarter with a driving, one-handed slam over Gasol. STREAKING SIXERS Philadelphia is nine games shy of tying the club record for home wins to start a season. The franchise has won 21 straight home games to start a campaign three times, twice in Syracuse (1949-50 and 1952-53 seasons) and once after moving to Philadelphia (1966-67). IMPROVED EMBIID It wasnt Embiids best performance, but it was much better than the last time the teams met. Embiid had the worst game of his career in a 101-96 loss at Toronto on Nov. 25. He was scoreless in 32 minutes, went 0 for 11 from the field, including 0 for 4 from 3-point range, and missed all three free-throw attempts. In the five games that followed and entering Sunday, Embiid averaged 26.8 points and 15.2 rebounds while going to the free-throw line 64 times, making 56. TIP-INS Raptors: Fred VanVleet (right knee contusion) was injured in the first half and didnt return. He had two points in 12 minutes and missed his only 3-point attempt, ending his streak of at least one 3 in every game this season. Now, only Houstons James Harden and Brooklyns Taurean Prince have a 3 in every game this season.  Terrence Davis II was issued a Flagrant 1 foul with 34.4 seconds left in the first quarter while contesting Mike Scotts 3-pointer. 76ers: Josh Richardson (right hamstring strain) missed his sixth straight game.  The teams will meet twice more, Jan. 22 at Toronto, and March 18 in Philadelphia.  Philadelphia Flyers goalie Carter Hart rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell prior to the game and sat courtside with teammate Scott Laughton.","401160980"
"WASHINGTON --  The Los Angeles Clippers are making progress. The Washington Wizards want the refs to make more calls. Kawhi Leonard had 34 points and 11 rebounds as the Clippers bounced back from their worst loss of the season by pulling away for a 135-119 win over the Wizards on Sunday night. Paul George scored 27 points and Montrezl Harrell had nine of his 20 in the fourth quarter for Los Angeles, which improved to 4-6 away from home two games into their six-game trip. The victory came two days after Los Angeles, now second in the Western Conference, opened the trip with a 119-91 loss at East-leading Milwaukee. ""I think the key to it is just getting more games, more times on the court,"" said George, one of several Clippers who battled early season injuries while searching for team chemistry. ""That's really the only way we're going to learn to trust, learn to play with confidence with one another, and learn to play together."" After seeing Leonard and George held to just 30 points combined against the Bucks, this time the Clippers frustrated one of the NBA's elite scorers, holding Bradley Beal to 20 points on 5-for-18 shooting. Nine of Beal's points came from the foul line, and the Wizards' 30 foul shots were three more than the Clippers had. But Beal believed he and his teammates got the short end. ""It's completely unfair and unacceptable,"" Beal said, ""that they allow a lot of stuff to go on with me out there and not get calls. Period."" Washington's bench kept the game competitive for more than three quarters. Davis Bertans tied his season-high with 25 points, including six 3-pointers. Troy Brown Jr. scored a career-high 20 points. The Wizards earned three of the games' five technical fouls, with Bertans even picking one up from the bench and Ish Smith picking up his during the fourth quarter. ""When Ish gets a tech, I know something's going on,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who received the other Wizards technical. ""That guy's is the nicest guy on the planet. He gets a technical by just telling a referee to call it the same on the other end. But we've got to play through it."" Los Angeles closed the game with a 22-10 run, including a stretch when Leonard and Harrell combined to score 17 consecutive points. Leonard turned his 10th defensive rebound into a transition dunk and unconventional four-point play after absorbing a personal foul and Smith's technical to make it 121-109. Later, he added a reverse layup and a pull-up jumper to stretch the lead to 125-112. Harrell followed with a thunderous baseline dunk and three-point play, and then another layup to make it 130-114. ""We found mismatches and just kind of put the game away,"" George said. TIP-INS Clippers: Maurice Harkless picked up a technical foul with 4:39 left in the first quarter, and Beverley picked up another 45 seconds later. . After leaving Friday's loss at Milwaukee early, F Patrick Patterson sat out with back spasms ... F JaMychal Green returned (tailbone) after a one-game absence. Wizards: Beal's first field goal came with 2:26 left in the first half, an acrobatic runner off the glass that tied it at 58-all. He finished the half with 11 points. . Smith's technical foul was one of three. Coach Scott Brooks picked up a technical with 4:39 left in the opening quarter, and Bertans got one while on the bench 39 seconds before halftime. COACH-ISMS ""I think our chemistry is really good, but I don't think we're playing well yet as a group -- that's two different things. Usually those things go hand-in-hand. They don't this year because we're around each other a lot, we just don't play with each other a lot. It's really the strangest thing I've ever seen."" -- Clippers coach Doc Rivers on his team's offensive flow at this point in the season. ""You can look at, yeah it is back to back to back, but it's really not back to back to back. Right? I'm not trying to have you agree with me, but I am."" -- Brooks on F Admiral Schofield playing three straight days between the NBA and G League. SIX FOR THE SIXTH MAN Bertans has now hit at least six 3s in five appearances this season, his first in Washington. He accomplished the feat only twice in his first three seasons in San Antonio.","401160981"
"Luka Doncic explains what he has to do better with his behavior around the referees after Dallas' loss at home to Sacramento. (0:55) DALLAS --  Nemanja Bjelica could see another game slipping away from the Sacramento Kings with the ball in Luka Doncics hands. But Doncic missed a tying attempt in the final seconds as the Kings withstood a furious rally and beat the Mavericks 110-106 on Sunday night. With the memory of an overtime loss at San Antonio on Friday fresh in his mind, Bjelica matched his career best with 30 points. Richaun Holmes rebounded Doncics attempt to tie the game with eight seconds left. Doncic had taken Sacramentos Cory Joseph down the lane for the turnaround shot that clanged off the front of the rim. After the rebound, the Kings called a timeout. Bogdan Bogdanovic in-bounded to Bjelica for a layup that sealed the win. We all see how great Luka is, Holmes said, so you just try to do as much as you can to take him out his comfort zone. Sacramento ended a three-game losing streak. Dallas had won five straight and 10 of 11 before the loss. It feels good to win, Bjelica said. After we lost (Friday) against San Antonio, its a very important win for us. Buddy Hield scored 26 points, including five 3-pointers, for Sacramento. Former Maverick Harrison Barnes had 13, Holmes added 12 and a game-high nine rebounds. Bogdanovic and Trevor Ariza scored 10 each. (Bjelicas) got the skill, the passing ability and shooting ability to really put pressure on the defense, Kings coach Luke Walton said. Were constantly encouraging him to be more aggressive and tonight he was aggressive. The Mavericks high scorer was Tim Hardaway Jr. with 29 points. He kept the Mavs in the game by making a career-high nine of 12 3-pointers. Doncic finished with 27 points, including 17 in the second half after Sacramento had sprinted to a 66-46 lead. We were very disappointed at our defense in the first half, and the second half was certainly way better, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. But, gotta play the whole game. A disappointing loss. Hardaway said there was a message at halftime. Do you guys want to get smacked at home or do you want to get the crowd involved and give yourself a chance to win and keep this thing going? Everybody took it to heart and did just that, Hardaway said. For Dallas, Dorian Finney-Smith and Kristaps Porzingis each had 13 points. Sacramento didnt trail in the game and led by as many as 24 points. The lead was 106-90 with 6:34 remaining. A 10-0 run capped by a 3-pointer by Doncic pulled the Mavericks within six points. The Kings lead dwindled to two points on a fadeaway by Porzingis with 34 seconds left. Barnes missed a shot in the lane. Finney-Smith grabbed the rebound with 14 seconds left. After a timeout, Doncic got the ball. Hes in the paint with a small defender on him, Hardaway said. Ill take my chances with him all day long. TIP-INS Kings: PG Cory Joseph started despite experiencing pain in his lower back after playing 38 minutes on Friday night. ... F Marvin Bagley III remained out because of a fractured right thumb. He has not played since the Oct. 23 season opener. ... Kings not named Hield or Bjelica were 1 for 11 (9%) on 3-pointers in the first half.

"Chris Paul laughs off the situation of being called twice for delay of game in the Thunders' win over the Trail Blazers. (0:56) PORTLAND, Ore. -- It was less than two weeks ago that the Oklahoma City Thunder last visited Portland, but this time they wouldn't leave with a loss. Dennis Schroder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each scored 21 points and the Thunder opened a four-game trip with a 108-96 victory over the Trail Blazers on Sunday night. The Thunder, who led by as many as 18 points in the first half, have won four of their last five games, the team's best stretch of the season. Chris Paul finished with 20 points. ""Obviously, the last time we came here we were really beat handily, from start to finish. We did get it back to nine, but we never really were in control of the game, constantly fighting an uphill battle,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said, recalling the 136-119 loss n Nov. 26. ""It was good that we were able to come into a tough place and play and find a way to win the game."" Damian Lillard had 26 for the Blazers, who have lost three of four. After trailing 55-47 at the break, the Blazers closed the gap in the third quarter and the Thunder held just an 82-78 advantage going into the final period. But Danilo Gallinari's 3-pointer put Oklahoma City up 95-87 with 4:14 left. Gilgeous-Alexander hit a 3-pointer and a floater that extended Oklahoma City's margin to 100-89 with 3:13 left and essentially put the game out of reach for the Blazers. ""I think we kind of just play well in stretches, and we don't really have the luxury of playing well in stretches. We're a team that if the ball's not going in, we gotta be getting to the 50-50 balls, we can't be letting teams get second and third opportunities. We foul every 30 seconds,"" Lillard said. ""I mean we are are doing a lot of things as a team that are putting us at a disadvantage."" Portland (9-15) was coming off a costly 136-113 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Starting forward Rodney Hood tore his Achilles during the first half and will miss the rest of the season. The Blazers had already lost forward Zach Collins to a shoulder injury that required surgery. And center Jusuf Nurkic continues to rehab from a broken leg. Portland made a move to shore up the frontcourt with the Nov. 19 signing of 10-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony, who hadn't played for more than a year. Anthony has fit in well with the Blazers, averaging 16.7 points and 5.6 rebounds through his first nine games. But he struggled against the Thunder, going 4 of 18 from the field and finishing with just nine points. Kent Bazemore started in Hood's place against Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City (10-12) was without Terrance Ferguson because of right hip soreness for the second straight game. Coach Billy Donovan said before the game that he expects Ferguson will miss Monday night's game at the Jazz as well. Abdel Nader started in his place. The Thunder were coming off a 139-127 overtime victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Oklahoma City forced overtime when Steven Adams threw a length-of-the-court pass that Schroder caught and laid in at the buzzer. The game got attention because Thunder guard Chris Paul alerted the officials that Minnesota's Jordan Bell had an untucked shirt, which led to a technical foul that helped the trailing Thunder send the game to overtime. Neither team looked sharp at the start on Sunday. Oklahoma City held a slight 21-20 lead at the end of the first quarter, on 31.8% shooting. Portland shot 27.6% to open the game. Schroder's pull-up jumper stretched the Thunder's lead to 41-29 midway through the second quarter. Portland clawed back into it and closed to within 51-47 on Anthony's 3-pointer, which capped a 10-0 Blazers run. But Portland couldn't get closer and trailed 55-47 at the break. Paul led all players with 16 points. Portland closed within 62-60 on Lillard's 3-pointer in the third quarter. The Blazers eventually pulled in front when Lillard made a trio of free throws, but it was short lived and the Thunder led 82-78 going into the final quarter. ""That's what's fun about our team,"" Paul said afterward. ""It's a team effort every night. As long as we keep playing like that I think we're going to keep grinding."" The teams split their first two games earlier this season. TIP INS Thunder: In the third quarter a fan dropped a phone on the court and Dennis Schroder picked it up and handed it back. ... It was the first of a four-game trip for Oklahoma City. ... Luguentz Dort fouled out with 4:34 left in the game. Trail Blazers: Damian Lillard went 0 for 6 from the field to start the game. His first basket was a floater with less than a minute left in the opening quarter. Then he had 16 points in the third quarter alone. ... Hassan Whiteside finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. REVENGE? Paul got a couple of delay of game penalties, which was the foul when Bell didn't have his shirt tucked in on Friday. One of them on Sunday was that he had his shooting shirt and his pants on when he was checking in, Paul said. ""He got me, got me back,"" Paul said. Asked if he thought it was because of Friday night, Paul responded, ""What do you think?"" Paul added diplomatically that he learned something about the rules, too. MISSING HOOD Lillard said he thought about Hood before the game when the team was watching clips, but the Blazers had to put aside their feelings about their injured teammate before the tip. ""Rodney's my boy, but I knew he wasn't coming out there to warm up and play the game with us. I think it impacted us on the floor (Hood was a starter), but I don't think mentally guys were out there thinking `Oh, We don't have Rodney.' It's what we've been dealt,"" Lillard said.","401160983"
"LOS ANGELES -- Anthony Davis had a season-high 50 points and the Los Angeles Lakers improved to a league-best 21-3 with a 142-125 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. Davis hit a floater with 4:39 remaining to reach 50 points for the fourth time in his career. He was 20 of 29 from the field and made all 10 of his free throws to go along with seven rebounds and six assists.

Each of the Timberwolves' starters had at least 12 points. Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins each had 19 points as Minnesota lost its fourth straight game. Davis had 42 points through three quarters, one more than his previous single-game best this season, 41 points in his return to New Orleans on Nov. 27. He tacked on 15 points in the third, but balanced scoring allowed Minnesota to stay within 110-103 as the quarter closed. It wasn't until the fourth quarter that the Lakers could relax. Davis went hard to the rim against Towns and drew a foul that put the Lakers in the bonus with 5:30 remaining. Davis had eight points during an 11-0 run that gave the Lakers a 73-65 lead at the half. He had 27 through two quarters, making 12 of 15 shots, including his first six attempts from the field. He provided a spark after James got his fourth foul with 2:27 left in the second quarter.

"Paul George teases that one day he'll share his end of the story as to why his time with the Pacers came to an end. (1:25) INDIANAPOLIS --  Paul George had the perfect response to a crescendo of boos Monday night. He silenced the crowd by making play after play and basket after basket. The former Pacers star scored 36 points, grabbed nine rebounds, made a season-high seven 3-pointers and had five assists in his first game in Indianapolis with the Clippers, leading short-handed Los Angeles to a 110-99 victory. ""It brings incentive when the moments are dead, it brings energy when moments are dead, it brings an aggression when moments are light,"" George said. ""I feed off it. It's fun, it makes the game that much more fun to compete in."" While George starred in the lead role, he got plenty of help, too. Montrezl Harrell added 26 points and eight rebounds and helped keep the Pacers at arm's length when they charged back in the final minutes. Patrick Beverley finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, while Maurice Harkless snagged 14 rebounds as the Clippers earned their fourth win in five games. But this night was all about George -- and the fans, many of whom still haven't forgiven him for forcing a summer trade three years ago. And with Kawhi Leonard sitting out, George took charge of his new team and didn't disappoint. He turned the game with a quick scoring flurry late in the second quarter by drawing a foul, making three free throws and then knocking down 3s on the next two possessions to give the Clippers a 55-46 lead. Harrell and Ivica Zubac continued the flurry by making four straight free throws before Zubac capped the 14-4 run with a tip-in that made it 60-48 at the half. ""Given the circumstances, I always want to win here,"" George said. ""And I always enjoy playing here. You put those two together and I'm going to compete on every possession to try to get a win."" George was just warming up. His fifth 3 extended the lead to 18 early in the third quarter and when Indiana cut the deficit to 13, George accounted for all of the Clippers' points in an 8-0 run to make it 84-65 and quiet the crowd. ""They got tired of booing when the fourth quarter came around and I cooled off a bit because they stopped booing,"" George said. Indiana, led by 20 points from Malcolm Brogdon, did make one last run. The Pacers got within 106-99 on T.J. Warren's 13-footer with 1:46 left, but Harkless answered with a layup and the Pacers didn't score another point. ""The last quarter, coach (Nate McMillan) just said go out and play, try to get it down to 10, put some pressure on them and try to make a run,"" Domantas Sabonis said after finishing with a career-high 22 rebounds. ""But we didn't make enough shots at the end."" TIP-INS Clippers: George has scored at least 31 points in three straight games. ... Zubac finished with 13 points. ... Los Angeles outscored Indiana 56-36 in the paint and was 10 of 32 on 3s. ... The Clippers won at Indiana for the first time since January 2016. Pacers: Sabonis also scored 18 points.

Doug McDermott had 17 points and made five 3s, matching his highest total since joining Indiana last season. ... Jeremy Lamb and T.J. Warren each scored 12. ... Indiana's four game home winning streak ended. INJURY REPORT Leonard sat out on the second night of a back-to-back with a sore left knee. The three-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP has missed seven games this season. The Clippers also played without JaMychal Green (bruised tailbone), Rodney McGruder (strained right hamstring) and Landry Shamet (sprained left ankle). But George doesn't expect Leonard to receive a similar reception when he returns to Toronto on Wednesday. ""The exact opposite of what it was like tonight,"" George said. POOR SHOOTING The Pacers couldn't overcome their poor shooting Monday. They finished at 35.4% from the field, were 10 of 35 on 3s and 21 of 28 from the free-throw line.

"BOSTON --  Gordon Hayward got back in the lineup and helped the Boston Celtics build a big lead. Kemba Walker made sure it didnt completely disappear. Walker led Bostons balanced scoring with 22 points, Hayward had 14 points in his return from a broken hand and the Celtics remained unbeaten at home with a 110-88 victory over the sinking Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. Jaylen Brown had 20 points and seven rebounds, Jayson Tatum added 19 points with 11 boards, and Daniel Theis scored 10 for Boston, which improved to 10-0 at TD Garden. It was good to have him back, Tatum said of Hayward. I was excited, everybody was excited, and he was excited. Jordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 19 points, and Tristan Thompson had 17 points with 11 rebounds. The Cavaliers have lost seven straight games and 13 of 14. Hayward returned exactly a month after breaking his left hand when he collided with San Antonios LaMarcus Aldridge as the Spurs big man was setting a screen. Hayward played 26 minutes, finishing with five rebounds and four assists. He spent the fourth quarter on the bench while his teammates let the Cavs cut into a huge deficit. Cleveland trailed 94-81 before Walker hit a trio of 3-pointers in a 1:22 span to put it away. I just told the team afterwards, I said: If you want to be special, then model (yourself) after Kemba, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Because Kemba sits over there and thinks his nights done, gets put back in the game, drills three 3s, and ends it. Hayward was expected to miss about six weeks. But he said this weekend the bone is healed and -- thanks to a plate with screws -- might even be stronger than it was before. It got hit,"" he told the team's flagship network, NBC Boston, during a postgame interview. ""It didnt even move, hardly. The Celtics, who never trailed, led by 13 at halftime and broke it open by outscoring the Cavaliers 26-10 over the opening 7:53 of the second half. Tatum had eight points and Hayward six in a spree that gave Boston a 79-50 edge. We didnt give in. I think we got down by 30, and then all of a sudden were down by 13, Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. Thats a huge positive that we didnt stop at that point. Cleveland scored 14 straight points spanning the end of the third quarter and early fourth. The Cavaliers sliced the margin to 85-73 on John Hensons layup with just over nine minutes to play, but Tatum nailed a 3 to spark a 7-0 spurt that pushed the Celtics ahead comfortably. Thats how we need to play, Cleveland forward Kevin Love said. The problem is putting it together for a quarter, two quarters, three quarters, 48 minutes. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love played his second straight game after being sidelined with an illness. He scored only seven points.  Collin Sexton came in averaging 20.6 points per game in his career against Boston, but went 1 for 8 in the first half. He finished with eight points. Celtics: G Marcus Smart missed the game with an eye infection and center Robert Williams was sidelined with left hip soreness.  The Celtics won Nov. 5 at Cleveland in the first meeting between the teams this season. QUICK START Boston hit seven of its initial 10 shots, opening its first double-digit lead (17-6) on Haywards fast-break layup -- his first basket of the game -- nearly halfway into the opening quarter. They led 29-18 after one. SEATS FOR SOLDIERS The Celtics and their season-ticket holders combined to give out more than 1,000 seats to the United Service Organizations. MISSING FREEBIES Thompson missed five of his first six free throw attempts and went 1 for 7 from the line. He shot 8 of 11 from the floor. MOMENT OF SILENCE The Celtics held a moment of silence before the national anthem for former Boston College baseball player Pete Frates, who died earlier in the day after a battle with Lou Gehrigs disease. He was 34. Frates helped inspire the ALS ice bucket challenge that has raised more than $200 million worldwide.","401160986"
"CHICAGO --  The Raptors held off the Chicago Bulls and then turned their attention toward the superstar who led them to their first championship in his lone season with Toronto. It figures to be quite a night on Wednesday when Kawhi Leonard visits Toronto for the first time since signing with the Los Angeles Clippers. The NBA Finals MVP will pick up his ring and probably get a warm welcome. ""I think it's going to be a good moment for him and I think he's going to be really, really happy to get his ring,"" Kyle Lowry said. The Raptors were happy to leave Chicago with a victory on Monday night. Pascal Siakam scored 22 points, and Toronto held on to beat the Bulls 93-92 when Zach LaVine missed a runner in the closing seconds. Norman Powell added 17 points, including six in the fourth quarter, and the defending NBA champions ended their first three-game skid since last November. After beating Chicago for the 11th straight time, their focus shifted toward Leonard and the Clippers. ""I would imagine that our fans are going to give him an amazing ovation,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""If they give him one-fifteenth of what they gave us on opening night, it's still going to be something. It was really amazing the night we got ours."" LaVine scored 20 for Chicago -- all in the first half. Wendell Carter Jr. and Daniel Gafford each had 14 points for the Bulls, who made just 12 of 46 3-pointers on the way to their sixth loss in eight games. ""I coach by faith,"" the Bulls' animated Jim Boylen said. ""I coach and teach every day on where I think we're gonna be. When that's gonna happen, when that's gonna break through, I'm not sure. But I'm gonna keep coaching that way."" He insisted the Bulls are making progress even though the losses continue to mount in a season when they expected to contend for a playoff spot. Some fans are staying away, leaving conspicuous empty seats. Boylen insisted the Bulls are playing ""good, hard basketball"" and simply need to win ""two or three more possessions."" ""I'm not gonna let any negativity deter us from that mission,"" he added. Raptors guard Fred VanVleet missed the game because of a bruised right knee. Lowry scored 11 points in his third game after missing 11 in a row with a broken left thumb. The five-time All-Star made 1 of 8 3-pointers, and the Raptors hit 7 of 29 from beyond the arc. HANGING ON Denzel Valentine led the way as Chicago opened the fourth quarter with a 14-6 run that turned a 71-all tie into an 85-77 lead. He nailed a jumper, buried two 3-pointers and fed Gafford for two alley-oop dunks. But the Raptors responded by scoring nine straight, going ahead on Lowry's two free throws with 3:52 remaining. Toronto was leading 89-87 when Chicago's Lauri Markkanen nailed a 3 with 1:45 left. Powell scored for Toronto and Gafford hit a layup to give Chicago a 92-91 lead. Then Lowry scored on a drive with 51 seconds remaining. The Bulls had a chance to win in the closing seconds after an out-of-bounds call got overturned by replay review. Tomas Satoransky inbounded to LaVine, who missed a runner in traffic along the left side. Gafford was unable to control the rebound, and the ball bounced around as time expired. TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse said an MRI showed no structural damage on VanVleet. Averaging 18 points and seven assists, he left in the first half of a loss at Philadelphia on Sunday. ... Siakam scored 13 points in the first quarter. Bulls: Chicago has not beaten Toronto since Feb. 14, 2017. ... Valentine scored a season-high 13 points. ... F Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder sprain) missed his sixth consecutive game. Boylen said Hutchison is not ready for contact in practice. ... Boylen said LaVine (shoulder) and G Coby White (hamstring) are playing through pain.","401160987"
"HOUSTON --  When Luke Walton took over as coach of the Sacramento Kings, he thought Nemanja Bjelica was just a big man he could use to create space. As he's gotten to know Bjelica, Walton has started to see that the 6-foot-10 forward is much more than that, which was clear on Monday night against the Houston Rockets when Bjelica made a 3-pointer at the buzzer to lift the Kings to a 119-118 victory. As I get to know him and see what he's capable of ... (I see) he's a skilled player, Walton said. The game was tied before Russell Westbrook drove into the lane for a layup that put Houston on top with a second to go. After a timeout, Cory Joseph inbounded the ball to Bjelica and his 3-pointer swished through the net to give the Kings the win and send the entire bench onto the court to celebrate. Great pass by Cory and I was open and went deep because I felt good at that range, Bjelica said. And I just took a shot and it went in. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni explained what happened with his team's defense on the final play. Just a breakdown, he said. We just left a guy wide open for no reason whatsoever. Buddy Hield had 26 points to lead the Kings, who had six players score in double figures as they won their second straight after losing the previous three. Hield and the rest of the Kings were thrilled to see Bjelica make such a big play. You saw when he made the shot how everyone loves him, Hield said. He's one of the best teammates on the team so everybody is happy for his success. Westbrook had a season-high 34 points and James Harden added 27 points and 10 assists for Houston. The game was tied earlier in the fourth when Westbrook dished it to Ben McLemore, whose 3-pointer made it 116-113 with 22.7 seconds to go. Hield missed a 3-pointer after that, but Bogdan Bogdanovic grabbed the rebound and got it back to Hield, who didn't miss this time to tie it again with 8.4 seconds left. Westbrook tied it earlier in the period on a layup before Harrison Barnes made it 113-110 with a 3-pointer. The lead was short-lived as Westbrook made a 3 seconds later to tie it again with about a minute left. The Kings led by six after a 3-pointer by Yogi Ferrell with about 9 minutes left. The Rockets scored the next four points before Bogdanovic's 3-pointer pushed Sacramento's lead to 105-102 midway through the quarter. Houston got four quick points from Clint Capela before Harden made two free throws to put the Rockets on top 106-105 with 4 1/2 to play. Harden had a 3-pointer waved off late in the third quarter when he was called for an offensive foul. D'Antoni challenged the call, but it was upheld. Joseph had a three-point play on the other end before Harden made a 3-pointer. This time Trevor Ariza was called for a foul on Harden and Walton challenged the call. Officials ruled that Ariza did foul Harden, but that it was before the shot so three points were taken off the board. Harden made both free throws to put Houston on top, but Barnes added a pair of free throws for Sacramento after that to leave the Kings up 94-93 entering the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Kings: F Marvin Bagley (broken right thumb) is getting close to a return after missing 22 games with his injury, but Walton wouldn't say exactly when he expects him to return. ... Bjelica had 17 points and made three 3-pointers. ... Barnes had 19 points and eight rebounds. Rockets: C Tyson Chandler missed a second straight game with flu-like symptoms. ... G Austin Rivers sat out with an illness. ... P.J. Tucker had 10 points for his fifth game with at least 10 points in the last seven. ... Houston outrebounded Sacramento 51-37. CREATIVE PRACTICE Walton wanted to try some new things on defense against Harden and Westbrook on Monday, but Sacramento's schedule hadn't left any time for practice lately. So he got creative. We put that in this morning in our film session, he said. We had tape down on the floor in the hotel ballroom that we were in and we walked through it in a ballroom. So with that being said, I think our guys did a good job of executing something that is new for us.","401160988"
"MILWAUKEE --  After outscoring opponents by an average of 34 points in their previous four games, the Milwaukee Bucks found out right away things would be tougher Monday when their first two shots were blocked. That slowed the Bucks down, but they still can't be stopped. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 15 rebounds to lead Milwaukee to its 15th straight victory, 110-101 over the Orlando Magic. ""Sometimes, it's good to have close games. You learn from that. You get used to being in close games and not always winning by 20 or 30,"" said Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP. ""We got the win, we grinded it out and played defense, but I think the two days in between made us a little bit rusty."" The Bucks were off Saturday and Sunday. They outrebounded Orlando 54-44, angering Magic coach Steve Clifford. ""You can't come on the road and get smacked on the glass like that. There's got to be some physicality,"" he said. ""Too man hustle points, second-chance points,"" added Aaron Gordon, who had 13 rebounds and 10 points. Khris Middleton scored 20 points for Milwaukee and Dante DiVincenzo added 12 points off the bench. Evan Fournier had 26 points for the Magic, who had won four straight. Terrence Ross scored 23. Ross hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Eric Bledsoe with 50 seconds left to cut the Bucks' lead to 107-101, but he missed the free throw. Then Middleton put away the game by responding with a 3-pointer. At 21-3, Milwaukee is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA's best record. The Bucks' first two shots were rejected by Magic forward Jonathan Isaac, the league's leading shot blocker. In all, Isaac recorded four blocks against four different players before the game was 8  1/2 minutes old. He finished with five blocks. Despite the rough start, the Bucks surged to a 31-18 lead after a 14-0 run late in the first quarter, with forward Ersan Ilyasova sinking two 3-pointers. They led 52-40 at halftime. Orlando shot just 29.5% from the field, including 14.3% from behind the 3-point line, in the first half. ""I think our defense, even though I didn't love the way we played tonight, our first-half defense kind of carried us through,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. The Magic, fueled by six 3-pointers in the third quarter, including three by Ross, drew within five points just before the end of the period. But they couldn't get any closer. TIP-INS Magic: C Mo Bamba was helped to the locker room in the second quarter with a left knee contusion, but returned. . Played without C Nikola Vucevic (right lateral ankle sprain) for the ninth straight game. ... Just as the Magic reached .500 for the first time this season, they faced a brutal trio of games. After the Bucks (1st place, Eastern Conference), they have home games against the Lakers (1st place, Western Conference) and Houston (4th place, West). Bucks: Entered Monday leading the league in points (121) and rebounds (51.8) per game. . Guard George Hill entered Monday leading the league in 3-point field-goal percentage (.516).... In attendance: California high school football coach Rob Mendez, who was born without arms and legs, accompanied by Packers linebacker Blake Martinez. GYM CLOSED The Bucks' being off Saturday and Sunday was a rare occurrence. ""It was well placed for us. But, if we don't play well tonight, we think it's a terrible idea,"" Budenholzer joked before Monday's game. ""I think we had good enforcement on a lockout day yesterday,"" he said of players staying away from the practice facility. KNEED-ING ROSS Ross shot 25 for 51 (49%) during the Magic's winning streak. ""I think, one, he's healthy,"" Clifford said. ""I think that the little knee injury that he had, it didn't prevent him from playing, but he wasn't explosive.""","401160989"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Derrick Rose is 31 and his body has taken a beating, but the 2011 NBA MVP showed once again he can still take over a game and knock down the decisive shot. Rose hit a 14-foot jumper in the lane with 0.3 seconds left and scored 17 of his team-high 21 points in the fourth quarter to lift the Detroit Pistons over the skidding New Orleans Pelicans 105-103 on Monday night. It was Rose's second consecutive strong fourth-quarter performance for the Pistons, who have won four of five. New Orleans lost its ninth straight. ""I don't talk or boast or brag about it, but I still have goals,"" said Rose, who has endured a series of physical setbacks, including an ACL tear, that have resulted in him playing for five teams over the past five years. ""I know overall where I'm at as a player and as a person, and I believe in myself,"" Rose added. ""That's where it all starts -- with me believing in myself -- and going to an organization and playing for a team that believes in me, too. I believe this is the start."" With the game tied at 103, Detroit worked an isolation play for Rose, who dribbled the ball out top against Jrue Holiday, one of the best defenders in the league. Rose drove into the lane, spun to the right and hit his jumper over Holiday's outstretched arms. ""He has everything,"" Holiday said. ""I think it was a good play on his part. I'm not going to take anything from him. He's a great player and the shot that he made was a tough shot. There was nothing I could do about it."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said Rose is not completely recovered from a strained right hamstring that forced him to miss five games last month. But his leg must be improving. In a 108-101 victory over Indiana on Saturday, Rose had 10 fourth-quarter points -- including four in the final 1:14 and a floater in the lane with 18.4 seconds left that iced the game. ""This man has done it,"" Casey said. ""His timing and his rhythm -- I still don't think he's back 100%, but it's coming. We've just got to make sure we play high IQ basketball."" Rose went 7 of 8 from the field and drained both 3-point attempts during his fourth-quarter flurry. After his go-ahead basket, New Orleans inbounded the ball from halfcourt toward Jaxson Hayes, but the rookie center could not get the tying tip-in. Brandon Ingram's 18-foot turnaround gave New Orleans a 103-101 lead with 1:11 to go, but Rose hit a spinning layup to tie it at 103 with 38.7 seconds remaining. Ingram then missed a tough-angle jumper from the left baseline over Blake Griffin, who switched over to guard him in the final 90 seconds. Ingram led the Pelicans with 31 points but scored only four in the fourth quarter. ""We knew Blake couldn't guard Ingram for long periods of time, but for one possession or two possessions, we wanted him to use his physicality (on Ingram), and he used it,"" Casey said. ""He did a great job on him."" Detroit had three players in double figures besides Rose: Langston Galloway (16 points), Luke Kennard (14) and Andre Drummond (13). Drummond also grabbed 10 rebounds. The Pelicans missed their first 10 3-point attempts in the third quarter and Detroit erased a six-point deficit to take a 67-61 lead. TIP-INS Pistons: Improved to 3-9 on the road. . Griffin played well defensively down the stretch, but he had a rough shooting night, going 1 of 9 and finishing with just five points. Pelicans: The team's marketing slogan this season has been ""Won't Bow Down,"" reinforced every game before tipoff by an employee banging a drum at midcourt. In the wake of a 46-point road loss to Dallas on Saturday, the drumbeat was shelved, at least temporarily. ... Derrick Favors, who has missed the last seven games since the unexpected death of his mother, has returned to the team but did not play against Detroit.","401160990"
"PHOENIX --  Kelly Oubre Jr. was ready for a low-key night on the town with friends and family to celebrate his birthday, dressed head to toe in black with a jacket, shirt, pants and shoes. His work was already done and the results were exactly what he wanted. The new 24-year-old had just poured in 24 points to help the Phoenix Suns top the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-109 on Monday. ""It's easy to get lost in the sauce when it comes to the emotions of the game,"" Oubre said. ""It's my birthday, definitely wanted to win, so I just wanted to go out there and do everything I possibly could to get the win."" Devin Booker led the Suns with 26 points, Oubre shot 8 of 15 from the field and Ricky Rubio finished with 16 points and 14 assists. The Suns won at home for the first time since Nov. 14, snapping a four-game losing streak at Talking Stick Resort Arena. Dario Saric added 20 points for Phoenix. Rubio has dished out at least 13 assists in three straight games and had only one turnover on Monday. ""You better keep your eyes up, don't get hit in the head with it, because it's going to come if you're open,"" Oubre said of Rubio's passes. ""He's just a wizard with it. He can do a lot of things on the basketball court that, looking at him, you wouldn't think he could do."" Minnesota lost its fifth in a row. The Timberwolves were led by Karl Anthony-Towns, who scored 33 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. He shot 12 of 18 from the field. Andrew Wiggins added 23 points and Jeff Teague had 16 off the bench. ""Not a good road trip for our defense,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Not a good road trip for us in general. We have things we need to clean up going home. We will have challenges but opportunities."" Phoenix trailed by three at halftime but rallied for a 94-85 advantage at the end of the third quarter. The Suns pushed that margin to 12 early in the fourth after Rubio's 3-pointer. The Timberwolves made a few small runs in the final period but could never get the deficit under seven. Rubio hit another 3 with 4:26 left to push the Suns ahead 111-98, and they cruised in the final minutes. ""We dug deep, found out what worked and spread the love,"" Oubre said. Towns had 21 points and eight rebounds in the first half as the Timberwolves took a 64-61 halftime lead. Oubre and Saric both scored 13 for the Suns. DEFENSIVE THIRD Suns coach Monty Williams said the game was won in the third quarter when his team held the Timberwolves to 21 points. Minnesota had 44 points in the paint in the first half, but Phoenix made it much tougher after the break. ""It wasn't anything we changed,"" Williams said. ""We just made a concerted effort to do what we wanted to do better."" PLAYOFF POSITION It's probably a little early to talk about playoff positioning, but the Suns and Timberwolves appear to be among the teams that could end up fighting for the final few spots in the Western Conference. Phoenix is 11-12 and tied with Oklahoma City for seventh place. Minnesota fell to 10-13 and is tied with Sacramento for the No. 9 spot. The top eight teams make the playoffs. ""We've been losing games that are important, that might come back to haunt us,"" Wiggins said. Said Anthony-Towns: ""We know the team we can be, we've just got to go out there and act and get it done."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Jake Layman (toe sprain) missed his ninth straight game. ... Towns scored at least 30 points against the Suns for the fourth time in his five-year career. The 33 points were a career high for him in the series. Suns: C Aron Baynes returned after missing nine of the past 10 games because of hip and calf injuries. Baynes has been productive when healthy this season, averaging 14.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. He played 15 minutes on Monday, finishing with 12 points and four rebounds. ... The Suns are 11-0 when leading after three quarters.","401160991"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Dennis Schroder's basketball identity is built on being aggressive at both ends of the court. Schroder is flourishing in his sixth man role because he goes into attack mode and never stops. That paid off again for the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 104-90 victory over the Utah Jazz on Monday night. Schroder's 27 points paced a Thunder second unit that outscored the Jazz reserves 45-23 in bench points. Schroder also made plenty of noise on the defensive end, pressuring multiple players into low-percentage shots and creating a turnover-friendly environment for a Utah team prone to making turnovers in bunches. ""I just try to impact the game when I get in,"" said Schroder, who set his career-high of 41 points in a game against the Jazz last season. ""Try to make the right plays offensively and defensively. It's just energy coming in and playing with pace."" Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points and Chris Paul added 16 points and seven assists for Oklahoma City. Steven Adams chipped in with 11 points and 13 rebounds. The Thunder shot 47% from the field after getting a big lift from the bench. It marked the 19th time in 23 games Oklahoma City has outscored its opponent in bench points. Schroder has led the bench in scoring in 19 of those contests. ""It's probably not talked enough about how selfless Dennis is,"" Paul said. ""Dennis a starter in this league on just about any other team. He's a star in his role and that's why our bench is so good."" Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points to lead the Jazz. Rudy Gobert added 19 points and 17 rebounds. The Jazz shot just 40% from the field and had just seven baskets in the third quarter when the Thunder pulled away for good. Utah lost for the sixth time in eight games and finds itself mired in an early season slow start yet again. ""It's kind of like a here-we-go-again situation,"" Mitchell said. ""It's only my third year, so I'm still trying to figure things out as well ... the biggest thing is to stick with it and trust. I ain't got much else to say besides that."" Utah and Oklahoma City traded big runs in the first half. The Jazz surged ahead 24-19 late in the first quarter on the strength of a 13-2 run. Gobert highlighted the spurt with back-to-back baskets -- part of the 14 points he scored before halftime. The Thunder answered with a 18-5 run that extended into the second quarter. Schroder got things going with a pair of baskets before the first quarter ended. Paul capped it off with back-to-back baskets, giving Oklahoma City a 37-29 lead. Oklahoma City stayed in front for the remainder of the game. The Thunder opened their first double-digit lead in the third quarter, going up 85-65 behind a 19-4 run. Schroder did most of the damage during the outburst, scoring four total baskets. His driving layup ignited the run and his third 3-pointer of the game finished it. ""We want to make sure he stays aggressive,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""He can get to his spots. He kind of knows what his shots are and his spots are. . We just want him to play with confidence. The team believes in him. I believe in him."" RISING ROOKIE Dealing with an injury-depleted roster, Donovan played guard Luguentz Dort 20-plus minutes for the second straight game. Dort made the most of his time on the court. The rookie, who is on a two-way contract, finished with a career-high nine points and a pair of rebounds in 29 minutes. He is averaging 5.5 points and 2.5 rebounds on Oklahoma City's current road trip. ""You wouldn't know he's a rookie, the way he's competing,"" Paul said. ""You just have to be ready when your name is called, and he's been unbelievable."" NO FOUL ZONE Utah shot just 12 free throws, matching a season-low. The Jazz had zero attempts in the fourth quarter. The inability to get to the foul line summed up a game in which the Jazz were low on energy and lacked aggressiveness in the second half. Utah turned the ball over frequently on drives to the basket or just settled for mediocre outside shots. ""Our decision making, collectively, that's where we need to come together and help each other on the offensive end,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""At the same time, we need to impose our will on the game, on that end."" TIP INS Thunder: Danilo Gallinari did not play because of a left ankle sprain. Terrance Ferguson also missed his third straight game because of right hip soreness. ... Darius Bazley collected a career-high seven rebounds. ... Oklahoma City forced 15 turnovers and scored 19 points off those miscues. Jazz: Mike Conley missed his third straight game with left hamstring tightness. .

"SAN FRANCISCO --  Ja Morant squashed the Golden State Warriors hopes for their first winning streak of the season. The rookie guard returned to Memphis lineup and scored 26 points to lead the Grizzlies to a 110-102 victory Monday night. Morant added seven assists, two rebounds and a steal in 29 minutes after missing the previous four games with a sore back. The No. 2 pick in the draft came up particularly big for Memphis (7-16) in the fourth quarter, scoring 13 points as the Warriors tried to claw their way back into it. Theres a lot of trust with the ball in his hands to make the right play, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. He had a couple assists late that we needed. Big moments for him, and its awesome to see so early in his career. The Warriors (5-20) finished a five-game road trip with a victory in Chicago on Friday and were trying to win consecutive games for the first time this season. Despite long-term injuries to stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, their roster is healthier and the bench deeper than its been in weeks. But Golden State shot just 38% from the floor and looked out of sync on both ends of the court for much of the night. I honestly think we just (messed) around with the game, forward Draymond Green said. Were not good enough to do that. Our transition defense was bad.  We played pretty horrible the entire game. It was definitely disappointing. Dillon Brooks scored 17 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 16 for the Grizzlies, who won for just the second time in 11 games. DAngelo Russell and Alec Burks each scored 18 for the Warriors, but Russell shot just 6 of 22. Morant, who entered the night leading NBA rookies at 18.6 points per game, was one of several Grizzlies who had an answer every time Golden State tried to make a run. With just over a minute remaining and the Warriors within 106-100, Morant drove the middle of the lane and went flying for a monster dunk that hushed the Chase Center crowd. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Brandon Clarke, who has been bothered by left hip and left oblique soreness, missed his fourth game in a row.  Kyle Anderson didnt play after testing out his sore right heel in warmups. Warriors: Jacob Evans III, sidelined since Oct. 28 with a left hip strain, played nine minutes in his return Monday.  Damion Lee, out with a fractured right hand, originally was listed as probable, but coach Steve Kerr said he needs more time before returning to the active roster. ALLENS INJURY Grayson Allen scored 15 points for Memphis and hit a couple timely shots from beyond the arc when the Warriors tried to rally. But Allen left the game in the third quarter after twisting his right ankle. Hopefully hes back pretty soon, Jenkins said. KERR ON GUN CONTROL On Monday night, the Warriors hosted a group of first responders and others affected by a mass shooting in Gilroy, California in July that left four dead and many more injured. Kerr, who has been outspoken about gun violence, was asked about the issue before the game and reiterated his feelings about the need for background checks before someone purchases a gun. The first thing that has to happen is our government officials have to decide that the safety of our citizens is more important than the money they receive from the NRA (National Rifle Association), Kerr said.","401160993"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Miles Bridges said he spent most of his rookie season thinking about highlight-reel plays. But the ultra-athletic 6-foot-6, 225-pound Charlotte Hornets forward, who was featured in the NBA All-Star Game dunk contest last season, said his mentality has changed in year two. ""This year it's about doing anything to get the win,"" Bridges said. ""(I'm) focusing my defensive assignment, trying to be aggressive and making plays in the clutch."" Devonte Graham scored 29 points, Bridges hit a huge 3-pointer with 7.7 seconds left and the Hornets beat the Washington Wizards 114-107 on Tuesday night in a game that featured 20 lead changes. Terry Rozier scored 17 points, Bridges had 16, P.J. Washington added 15 and Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo both had double-doubles as Charlotte salvaged a 2/3 record on a five-game homestand. Davis Bertans scored a career-high 32 points and made eight 3-pointers for Washington. Rui Hachimura added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Wizards, who have lost six of seven. ""The guy is a bucket-getter,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Bertans. ""Every shot is a great shot because it's always squared up. He has a great release. It's such a high release and he's 6-10."" While Bridges' 3 stood out, Hornets coach James Borrego said he likes that the former Michigan State standout is attacking the basket more often. ""For our offense to be successful, we have to get the rim,"" Borrego said. ""We have to put pressure on the rim. If we just play on the perimeter, that won't work. And Miles is one of those guys who can put pressure on the rim, whether it's a post-up or rim attack or drive or offensive rebound. When he does that, he creates offense for us."" Graham said when Bridges drives, it opens things up for other players. ""I keep telling to him be aggressive,"" Graham said. ""Bradley Beal was talking to him a little bit, so it kind of turned him up a little bit. I love it when he plays like that. He has the body to play like that and he needs to do it every time."" The Hornets led by one when Graham drove the left side of the lane, scored on a left-handed scoop layup and drew the foul for a three-point play with 1:34 left. Rozier added one of two free throws before Bertans made a 3 from the wing to cut Charlotte's lead to 109-107 with 31.4 seconds left. With the Wizards pressing up on the ball, Graham passed to Washington, who found Bridges alone in the right corner for a 3 that the lefty swished to make it a two-possession game and essentially seal Washington's fate. ""I thought DB (Bertans) was huge,"" Washington's Ish Smith said. ""He got us back in the game, but we just came up short."" TIP-INS Wizards: Beal picked up a technical foul in the final seconds of the first half for arguing that he got fouled on a coast-to-coast dunk. Beal had a rough night all around. He had 16 points but was 0 for 7 from 3-point range. Hornets: Marvin Williams sat out his second straight game with knee soreness. ... The Hornets held the Wizards to 48 points in the first half, their fewest allowed in the opening half this season. GRAHAM'S ADJUSTMENTS With his dramatic improvement in his second season, Graham is now starting to see different looks on defense. Teams are blitzing him, playing him full court and face-guarding him. But Graham keeps on producing. ""He's just reading the defense right now,"" Borrego said. ""If he can get downhill, he gets downhill, when they bring the big up he knows he's got to pocket pass, so this is just him learning on the fly right now. Teams are throwing different coverages at him. We'll see a different coverage (Wednesday) night."" ANOTHER INJURY As if the Wizards don't have enough injuries, starting guard Isaac Bonga left the game in the second quarter after getting off-balance while driving to the basket and hitting the back of his head on the floor. The Wizards were already without John Wall, Thomas Bryant, Jordan McRae, Isaiah Thomas and CJ Miles.","401160994"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid threw the ball over his shoulder into the basket and celebrated the no-look shot with a little shake and shimmy for the crowd. It was vintage Embiid -- and something the fun-loving center wants to do more. Yes, the 76ers are winning. But their star big man wants to be in the middle of it. Embiid scored 22 points, including two key free throws with 15.3 seconds left, and Tobias Harris added 20 to keep Philadelphia perfect at home with a 97-92 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night. Matisse Thybulle added 13 points for the Sixers, who are 13-0 in Philadelphia. They have won three straight and seven of eight. Embiid added 10 rebounds but once again struggled offensively down the stretch. After being benched late in Philadelphia's 110-104 win over Toronto on Sunday for committing three straight turnovers, he missed a 3-pointer, a jumper and committed a turnover in crunch time before making the two big foul shots. Fortunately for the 76ers, their defense clamped down on Denver down the stretch. ""I need to be myself,"" Embiid said. ""When I'm having fun, I dominate."" Embiid said he has cut back on the extra-curricular activity while trying to be more mature since his two-game suspension for fighting Karl-Anthony Towns on Oct. 30, which was followed by a postgame barrage of insults on social media. Embiid, however, let loose after his improbable shot ended the third quarter with Philadelphia ahead 83-76, and the crowd loved it. ""I need to do it more,"" he said. A two-time All-Star, Embiid entered averaging 21.9 points and 12.5 rebounds per game after putting up 27.5 points and 13.6 boards last season. Will Barton had 26 points to lead the Nuggets, who have lost three in a row and five of six. Leading scorer Jamal Murray was injured with 6:49 left in the first quarter when he collided with Ben Simmons and didn't return. The Nuggets set a franchise record for largest fourth-quarter comeback when they rebounded from 19 points down to start the final period in a 100-97 win over Philadelphia in Denver on Nov. 8. They tried again, but couldn't come all the way back this time. The 76ers led by 10 early in the fourth after Josh Richardson's deep 3-pointer from the top of the key made it 88-78 with 8:54 remaining. The Nuggets scored the next eight, capped by Barton's three-point play with seven minutes left, to pull to 88-86. But then Thybulle hit a pivotal 3 and grabbed a big offensive rebound on Philadelphia's next possession, which ended with Al Horford's jumper that put the 76ers in front 93-86 with 4:36 to play. ""You could feel the building light up,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said of Thybulle's impact. ""He's an energy giver when he can make those plays."" Denver had chances from that point on but went cold from the field, making just one field goal until Nikola Jokic's runner made it 95-92 with 18.9 seconds left. The Nuggets had just six points in the last seven minutes, missing seven of nine shots. Nuggets coach Michael Malone liked his team's resolve but said the lack of offensive execution is a recurring problem. ""Our offense has been holding us back and tonight was another example,"" he said. ""We have to find ways to be more consistent."" HOME SWEET HOME Philadelphia is within nine victories of matching the franchise mark for consecutive home wins to start a season, set during the 1966-67 season. ""It says we have a great crowd and great focus here,"" Harris said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone received a technical with 7:16 left in the first half. . Barton scored the first 13 Denver points. . Jokic had 15 points, seven rebounds and 11 assists. ... Murray went scoreless and left with what the team called a ""trunk contusion."" 76ers: Richardson returned to the lineup after missing six games with a right hamstring strain. He had three points.","401160995"
"MIAMI -- Trae Young figured the game was over. Turns out, Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat were just getting started -- on one of the wildest stat nights in team history. Duncan Robinson tied a franchise record with 10 3-pointers, Butler and Bam Adebayo each had triple-doubles, and the Heat went on a late flurry to beat the Atlanta Hawks 135-121 in overtime Tuesday. The Heat were down by six with 59 seconds left in regulation when Young took a celebratory walk to the Atlanta bench for a timeout, with Butler hearing him shout, ""It's over!"" Miami scored the next 22 points -- the final six of regulation and the first 16 of overtime -- to improve to 18-6 overall and 11-0 at home. ""I don't think anybody really thought the Heat were relevant,"" Adebayo said. ""We're making people watch us."" Kendrick Nunn scored a career-high 36 points, one off the Heat rookie single-game record. Robinson scored 34, a career high. Adebayo finished with a career-high 30 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. Butler had 20 points, a career-high 18 rebounds and 10 assists. Afterward, Butler couldn't resist a jab at Young on Instagram, writing: ""this man @traeyoung is a teller of the future. he was right. game WAS over!"" Young also took to social media and acknowledged his mistake in a short tweet. Butler praised his teammates, telling reporters, ""Everybody in this locker room has a confidence that they're the best player on the floor at any given time. Man, when you've got guys who think like that, nothing's ever over."" It was the NBA's widest margin of victory in an overtime game since Oct. 31, 2009, when Philadelphia beat New York 141-127. De'Andre Hunter scored 28 points and Young added 21 points and nine assists for Atlanta, which fell to 0-3 against the Heat this season. ""What's tough is Robinson goes 10-for-14, a career high, two guys with triple-doubles, they played out of their minds a little bit with a couple guys, and we still had a six-point lead with under a minute to go,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I feel bad."" Vince Carter, in the 1,500th regular-season game of his career, scored 12 for the Hawks. Jabari Parker had 16 points and Cam Reddish added 14 for Atlanta. The Hawks used a 13-0 run to take an eight-point lead early in the fourth before the Heat clawed back and tied the score 111-111 on a 3-pointer by Robinson with 3:11 left. Atlanta scored the next four to reclaim the lead, Butler missed a pair of free throws with 1:18 left, and Alex Len had a dunk on the next Hawks possession for a 117-111 lead. The rest was all Heat. ""Our energy was dead as soon as overtime started,"" Young said. In other words, it was over. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta made 13 3-pointers in the first half, tying a team record set on three other occasions. The Hawks had only nine 2-pointers before intermission. ... Hunter returned to the starting lineup and Reddish played off the bench. ... Kevin Huerter (shoulder) remains on a minutes restriction of about 25 per night, though that isn't expected to last much longer. He played 26 in regulation, then didn't play in overtime. Heat: Miami again played without four of its six highest-paid players. Goran Dragic (groin strain), Justise Winslow (back strain), James Johnson (illness) and Dion Waiters (illness) were out. Dragic is working toward a return. Winslow has missed 14 of Miami's 24 games, Johnson has made only six appearances, and Waiters has yet to play. FAREWELL, VINCE Barring a playoff meeting or trade, this was Carter's final game in Miami. He appeared in Miami as an opponent 36 times including playoffs, tying Allan Houston for third most all time behind Paul Pierce's 42 and Patrick Ewing's 37. Carter's 714 points are fourth most of any opponent in Miami, behind Pierce's 867, Ewing's 754 and Michael Jordan's 722. STAR WARS NIGHT The Heat threw a Star Wars-themed celebration, replete with lightsabers on the court during the pregame delivery of the game ball, Darth Vader patrolling the arena and radio analyst Ruth Riley Hunter with her hair done like Princess Leia. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is a fan of the sci-fi saga. ""Every summer, the whole family gets together in Hawaii, and we end up watching Star Wars,"" Spoelstra said.","401160996"
"In the wake of an easy win, the Portland Trail Blazers agreed they needed the rout for their own morale. Damian Lillard had 31 points, including eight 3-pointers, and Portland handed the wretched New York Knicks their 10th straight loss, 115-87 on Tuesday night. Anytime you have that type of win, and the way that we did it, I think we should feel good about it, especially in a game that we feel we should have won,"" Lillard said. Hassan Whiteside added 17 points and 15 rebounds as the Blazers ended a two-game skid. Portland led by as many as 32. Those kind of games feel good,"" coach Terry Stotts weighed in. Julius Randle had 15 points for the Knicks, who have won just four games, fewest in the NBA. They have one victory on the road. The Knicks opened their four-game West Coast trip in disarray after coach David Fizdale was fired on Friday, just hours after he ran practice. Mike Miller was named interim head coach, and New York lost 104-103 at home to Indiana the next night. In an 82-game schedule you may have some nights where it won't go in, and we found ourselves in that, Miller said. In Portland, New York faced Carmelo Anthony, who played for the Knicks from 2011-17. When the Blazers picked up Anthony on Nov. 19, the 10-time All-Star had been out of the game for more than a year. But he has fit in well with Portland as a starter, averaging nearly 16 points and six rebounds a game. Anthony finished with 16 points. We were locked in, since this morning, since shootaround, we were locked in, Anthony said. Dame came out and led us, Hassan played great, but I thought overall defense was what got us going. We were talking, we were active, a lot of energy on the defensive end. Portland was coming off a 108-86 defeat at home to Oklahoma City on Sunday, with the team still reeling from the loss of Rodney Hood, who tore his left Achilles tendon in a loss to the Lakers on Friday. Hood will miss the rest of the season. Lillard's step-back 3 put the Blazers up 32-22 at the end of the first quarter. Lillard had 17 points in the opening period. Portland led by as many as 21 in the half and was up 60-41 at the break behind 25 points from Lillard. The Knicks were 2 of 15 from 3-point range in the first half and 7 of 38 for the game. Lillard's 28-foot 3-pointer put the Blazers up 74-47 midway through the third quarter. He didn't play in the fourth. Anthony and CJ McCollum went to the bench for good early in the fourth. Miller also sat his starters for much of the final period. It was a team we felt we should (beat) on our home floor, but I thought our approach and how we came out, not looking like it was going to be an easy game or nothing like that -- we respected our opponent,"" Lillard said. We did the right things defensively, we executed our scouting report and offensively we executed as well as we have in a while, maybe all season. TIP-INS Knicks: New York hasn't beaten Portland since November 2016, losing six straight. ... Mitchell Robinson added 14 points for his ninth game in double figures this season. ... Miller was asked about whether the team was down after the lopsided loss: I think it's hard anytime when that happens. That's maybe the biggest challenge for any team is when someone is going good, you try to answer, and you miss a few of those shots. Trail Blazers: A report surfaced earlier Tuesday that Kevin Love, currently with the Cleveland Cavaliers, would be interested in playing for Portland. Love grew up in Oregon and was a star at Lake Oswego High School. The Blazers are considered candidates to make deals when trade restrictions lift on Dec. 15 because of their need at forward. IN THE ZONE The Blazers went to a zone defense on a couple of possessions. Stotts said the team was just experimenting. The way things are going, we are trying different things, different lineups, he explained. ""I talked to the assistants earlier today about, what can we look at? We are trying to find different things.""","401160997"
"CLEVELAND --  James Harden dropped another one of those demoralizing step-back 3-pointers that have made him famous, causing Cavaliers rookie Kevin Porter Jr. to look at Cleveland's bench for help. Nothing could be done. ""He made a lot of shots you can't do anything about,"" Porter said. A lot of them is right. Harden scored 55 points -- 20 in the fourth quarter -- and Russell Westbrook added 23 points as the Houston Rockets withstood an unexpected scare from Cleveland and held on for a 116-110 win Wednesday night over the free-falling Cavs, who have lost eight straight and 14 of 15. Harden made four 3-pointers and shot 7 of 8 in the fourth while matching Kyrie Irving's arena record for points in a game. His fourth 50-point performance this season bailed out the Rockets, who allowed the Cavs to score 24 straight points in the second half. ""He's incredible,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""If it was the first time he's done this, I'd be like, `Wow! Look at that,' but he's done it at this level for years."" Harden became the fourth player in NBA history with multiple games of 10 or more 3-pointers, joining Golden State's Stephen Curry (15) and Klay Thompson (5), and former Cavs guard J.R. Smith (3). Cleveland was still leading 108-107 when Harden, who came in as the league's top scorer at 38 points per game, dropped a floater in the lane with 1:03 left. After a turnover by Cavs guard Jordan Clarkson, P.J. Tucker hit a 3 from the corner and Clint Capela had a dunk following another Cleveland miscue. The inexperienced Cavs crumbled in the final minute, committing three turnovers. But it was their inability to slow down Harden that was their biggest undoing. His 55 points seemed almost effortless, as if he could score whenever he pleased. Need a bucket? Call on Harden. A 3-pointer? He's the man. Whatever Houston needed, Harden got it for the Rockets. ""We caught a guy who plays at an MVP level,"" Cleveland forward Kevin Love said. ""He couldn't miss."" Harden finished 20 of 34 from the floor, including 10 of 18 on 3s. He made all five free throws, and added eight assists and two steals. ""Good defense turned into James Harden offense,"" D'Antoni said. ""I've got nothing but praise for him on the defensive end, in addition to the offensive end. He realized that for us to win big, he's got to do it (play defense) -- and he is doing it. He's always in the right position."" Harden shrugged off another big personal night, saying the Rockets have learned they're going to get the other team's best shot every game. ""We're a great team,"" he said. ""We get their best whether they come to our place or when we're on the road -- so teams are like, `We're playing the Rockets, so we have extra juice."" Capela added 13 rebounds for Houston, which figured to have an easy time with the Cavs, who are struggling under first-year coach John Beilein. Cleveland, though, came to play and was led by Porter's season-high 24 points. Collin Sexton added 18 and Love had 17 points and 11 boards. Harden connected on a pair of 3-pointers during a 16-2 run in the third quarter when the Rockets, who were sleepwalking through long stretches of the first half, appeared to take control. But Houston relaxed, and Cleveland went on a jaw-dropping 24-0 run -- all without Love, who was on the bench -- over a 4:53 stretch bridging the third and fourth quarters to a take a 99-88 lead on Porter's bucket. Harden stopped the Cavs' surge with basket in the lane and scored Houston's next 13 points. LONG RUN Cleveland's 24-point spurt was the club's longest since a 29-0 burst on Dec. 6, 2009, against Milwaukee. POINT, COUNTER POINT Harden became the third player to score at least 50 in the building's history, joining Irving (55) and Allen Iverson (54, 50), who did it twice. TUNED OUT Beilein said the increased trade chatter surrounding Love has not been a distraction. ""I've been hearing about that from the day I was hired,"" said Beilein, echoing his predecessors. ""Whatever happens in this basketball business happens. We want Kevin to play at his best and I'm sure he does as well. We hope that happens today and every day going forward."" TIP-INS Rockets: Irving scored 55 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Jan. 28, 2015. ... Houston tied a club record with its ninth straight game scoring at least 115 points. ... Harden's 868 points through 23 games were the most since Rick Barry had 886 in 1966-67. ... Harden, who also leads the league in minutes per game, is the only player averaging more than 25.0 points and 2.0 steals. . C Tyson Chandler (illness) missed his third game in a row, while G Austin Rivers (illness) sat out his second straight. Cavaliers: Beilein said he and his staff discussed changing the starting lineup but stuck with the same five: Love, Sexton, Cedi Osman, Tristan Thompson and Darius Garland. ""We've really done some studying which five-man groups or even two-man combinations play best together,"" he said. ""We may be onto some things."" ... Garland is one of 11 rookies averaging double digits in scoring.","401160998"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana aced one major test Wednesday. Now coach Nate McMillan expects the Pacers to continue putting up high marks. Malcolm Brogdon scored 29 points and made all 15 of his free throws, the Holiday brothers combined for 20 fourth-quarter points and Indiana rallied from a 10-point deficit to finally beat the Boston Celtics 122-117. ""One of our problems all season has been closing out these games against elite teams,"" Brogdon said. ""Tonight we were able to do that so it will definitely help our confidence. The rebuilt Pacers snapped a seven-game losing streak against Boston, which included a first-round playoff sweep last season. They managed to dig themselves out of a 94-84 hole to start the fourth quarter with teamwork, defense and patience. And they did it with injured All-Star Victor Oladipo cheering throughout the stretch run. The fact this performance came on a night three-time All-Star Kemba Walker scored a season-high 44 points, making seven 3-pointers and dishing out seven assists to lead Boston only made it sweeter. ""He's obviously one of the great players in the league and once he gets downhill, it's tough to stop him,"" Aaron Holiday said. ""I just tried to fight over the screens and hoped my bigs could help me at the rim."" For McMillan, it was precisely the kind of effort he talked about Monday as the Pacers entered their most challenging three-week stretch so far. And against an old nemesis in Boston, the Pacers played it perfectly. They withstood Walker's 15-point first quarter, his scoring flurries at the end of the first half and start of the second half, even the 12-2 run Walker and Jayson Tatum spurred to close out the third quarter. So with Walker on the bench, Indiana took advantage and turned the game with a team effort. The Pacers forced five turnovers in the first 8 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter to close to 98-96. Doug McDermott finally tied the score at 102 with two free throws at the 5:07 mark. Aaron Holiday gave Indiana a 105-104 lead with 4:16 left and Justin Holiday added gave Indiana a 114-109 lead with 1:26 left. Brogdon made six free throws in the last 17.1 seconds and Walker fired an airball on a 3 that would have tied it with 4 seconds to go. Boston's four-game winning streak ended. ""I just missed,"" said Walker, who was 2 of 7 in the fourth. ""I took some good ones, maybe a few that weren't so good but I just missed."" TIP-INS Celtics: Guard Marcus Smart missed his second straight game with a left eye infection. ... Boston had assists on each of its first 11 baskets. ... Jaylen Brown had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists before fouling out. ... Tatum finished with 16 points, Brad Wanamaker had 12 and Daniel Theis scored 11. ...

Brogdon also had eight assists and had the best free-throw shooting performance by a Pacer since Danny Granger made all 16 of his attempts on March 1, 2011. ... Indiana's bench outscored Boston's 47-19... BACK HOME AGAIN Trips to Indianapolis are usually enjoyable for Boston coach Brad Stevens, who led nearby Butler to two Final Four appearances after growing up in Brownsburg -- an Indianapolis suburb. And he's far from alone. Gordon Hayward also grew up on the west side of Indianapolis and played on Butler's first Final Four team. Rookie guard Carsen Edwards starred at Purdue and rookie guard Romeo Langford was the state's 2018 Mr. Basketball Award winner. He played at Indiana University last year and had a large group of supporters make the trip from his southern Indiana hometown, New Albany, for the game. OLADIPO UPDATE McMillan said Oladipo looks better in practice and continues to make progress, but there's still no timetable for his return from a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee. He suffered the injury in January. ""He's still rehabbing, working hard and he's certainly getting better,"" McMillan said. ""He's getting closer but I think he's still a ways off.""","401160999"
"LeBron James explains how he was able to achieve a triple-double in the Lakers' win vs. the Magic. (0:44) ORLANDO, Fla. --  LeBron James has made a career out of carrying his team through tough stretches, and in his 17th season, he hasnt lost a step. James had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his sixth triple-double this season, helping the Los Angeles Lakers to a 96-87 win over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. Anthony Davis had 16 points and 12 rebounds and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 15 for the Lakers, who have won 13 of 14. But it was James who was the deciding factor, accounting for every point in a 10-0 run that broke a 71-71 tie early in the fourth quarter. Orlando had rallied from 24 points down to tie it at 71-all on a 3-pointer from Michael Carter-Williams with 10:48 left in the game. James pulled the plug on the Magic comeback. He assisted on the Lakers next three possessions, hitting a cutting Avery Bradley in the lane for a layup, Alex Caruso for a corner 3 and Jared Dudley for another wide open 3-pointer. He is the best in the world for a reason, Caruso said. Him just getting to the paint draws so many bodies the were open on the backside. He creates a lot of attention so its up to us to play off that and we did a good job tonight.. James finished the run with a defensive rebound and a bullish drive through the Magic defense for a layup and 81-71 lead with 7:47 left in the game. The Magic never got closer than five after that. LeBron was great, especially down the stretch, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. He quarterbacks the action for us, keeping the lead at a healthy distance and making plays on the defensive end. Jonathan Isaac led Orlando with 19 points, all in the second half. Evan Fournier had 18 and Aaron Gordon finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. Mo Bamba had 13 points. Orlando had to dig itself out of a 26-9 deficit after the first quarter. The Magic shot just 19% (4 of 21) in the quarter and gifted the Lakers five turnovers to go with the poor shooting. That first quarter is us not understanding who youre playing against or what our team has to do to play well, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. It took us 10, 11 minutes to get locked into what we had to do, and then we played fine. The Magic hit three straight 3-pointers, two by Fournier, to start the second half and eventually cut what had been a 24-point deficit to 57-55 on a dunk by Khem Birch with 7:27 left in the third period. Los Angeles never gave up the lead, but had trouble getting into any flow against an aggressive Orlando defense. SMARTER COACH NOW Frank Vogel returned to Orlando for the first time since being fired by the Magic in 2018. Vogel won just 32.9% (54-110) of his games in two seasons in Orlando. He is winning 87.5% of the time his first year in Los Angeles. Of course, he didnt have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on his Magic roster. All coaches are smarter with great players, Vogel said. TIP INS Lakers: Jared Dudley was ejected from the game with 7:06 for fighting.  Los Angeles missed its first six 3-point attempts of the game, then six of their next eight before halftime.  The Lakes committed 11 turnovers in the first half. Magic: Wes Iwandu was ejected from the game with 7:06 to play for fighting.  Starting PG Markelle Fultz sat out the game with stomach flu.  Three Magic starters got shut out and Aaron Gordon scored just one point in that period.","401161000"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard got his ring, and the Los Angeles Clippers got another win. Leonard scored 23 points in his return to Toronto, Lou Williams had 18 and the Clippers won their third straight game Wednesday, beating the slumping Raptors 112-92. Maurice Harkless scored 14 points and Paul George had 13 as the Clippers evened their road record at 6-6. Before the game, Leonard received his championship ring from the 2018-19 season, when he helped Toronto beat Golden State in six games for the franchise's first NBA title. Following a pregame video tribute, Leonard's former teammates, along with coaches and team executives, gathered in a circle at center court. As the standing-room-only crowd roared with approval, Leonard embraced each player in turn before guard Kyle Lowry presented him with his ring. After slipping it on, Leonard raised his arms and waved. ""It was great, it was a great moment,"" Leonard said. ""They did a great job putting it together, having all the players out there that won with me, standing there and presenting the ring. ""It was a special season for us, for me, for the whole city and country,"" Leonard added. ""I'm glad we were able to win. It was a blessing."" Leonard didn't put the ring on all the way before the game, but spent some more time with it afterward. ""I sat in the locker room with it for a little bit,"" he said, ""just admiring it and just remembering all the memories and all the hard work that went into it."" Lowry, who was planning to have dinner with Leonard after the game, said he was happy to hand over the diamond-studded hardware. ""He helped this franchise do amazing things and he got his ring,"" Lowry said. Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Leonard was touched by the warm welcome he got from Toronto's fans. ""It meant a lot,"" Rivers said. ""Some players just don't let you in but I can tell you that ovation, to him, was very heartfelt. There's no doubt about that."" Clippers guard Patrick Beverley scored 11 points in 19 minutes before leaving in the third quarter because of a concussion. Beverley collided with Marc Gasol's shoulder as the Raptors center was setting a screen. Pascal Siakam scored 24 points, Norman Powell had 22 and OG Anunoby 13 as the Raptors lost for the fourth time in five games and dropped their third straight at home. Toronto set a franchise record with nine straight home victories to begin the season. The Raptors last lost three straight at home between Nov. 29 and Dec. 5, 2015. The Raptors shot 8 for 36 from 3-point range, their worst mark of the season. Toronto matched a season low with 31 field goals. They also had 31 in a Nov. 29 win at Orlando. ""We're in a period where we're not playing very well here for about a week,"" coach Nick Nurse said. Leonard was held to 12 points, a season low at the time, when the Raptors visited the Clippers on Nov. 11. The three-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP shot 1 for 11 in that game, but Los Angeles won 98-88. Leonard shot 8 for 14 Wednesday, going 2 for 4 from 3-point range and 5 for 5 from the free throw line. ""I thought Kawhi was great,"" Rivers said. ""What I loved about him was he was patient. He just waited. He kept accepting the traps, he kept making the right play."" Leonard returned after sitting out Monday's win at Indiana because of a sore left knee.

Find Devonte' Graham,"" Hornets coach James Borrego joked. ""I learned from Pop (Gregg Popovich) that's a good move. He was rolling."" Graham scored a career-high 40 points, and the Charlotte Hornets rallied from a 20-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 113-108 on Wednesday night. ""I just want to win, that's what I'm thinking,"" Graham said of his mindset down the stretch. ""Make a play."" Graham had 27 points in the second half in Charlotte's second straight victory. Miles Bridges added 14 points. ""It's a mindset as a group,"" Graham said of Charlotte's comeback. ""All of us young guys all come from winning programs, so we know what it's like when you've got a target on your back in college and every team is coming for you and you've got to play every night as hard as you can."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 10 rebounds for Brooklyn, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Graham hit a step-back jumper followed by a deep 3-pointer to give Charlotte a 111-106 lead with 22 seconds remaining. ""When he has big nights, they have a chance to win,"" Dinwiddie said. ""When he doesn't, they're kind of dead in the water."" Dinwiddie cut the lead to 111-108 by hitting two of three free throws with 18 seconds left, but Bridges made a free throw and the Nets misfired on two 3-point attempts on their next possession. In the third quarter, Charlotte went on a 21-7 run to cut the deficit to 84-81. Graham led the comeback with 10 points during the run. The Hornets entered the fourth quarter trailing 86-84. ""I guess we could have double-teamed him,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We could have blitzed him. We did change our pick-and-roll coverage a bunch of times. That didn't seem to help. You call all-out double-team him. We could have done that. Didn't do it. Looking back, maybe should have done it."" The Nets took a 64-53 lead into the half as Allen led all scorers with 16 points. Graham had 13 for Charlotte, which shot 38% from the field in the first half. Brooklyn took it's largest lead at 52-32 during the quarter. Brooklyn took a 34-26 lead after the first quarter while shooting 57% from the floor as Allen led the Nets with 11 points. Charlotte's backcourt of Graham and Terry Rozier each had seven. TIP-INS Hornets: Coach James Borrego praised Allen's development. ""He looks to me like a smarter and more active defender this season,"" Borrego said. . Nicolas Batum (left hand) and Marvin Williams (right knee) were both out. Nets: Kyrie Irving (shoulder impingement) missed his 13th straight game. Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) missed his 15th straight game. LeVert, who underwent right thumb surgery on Nov. 14, is on track to return from his original 4-6 week timeline, coach Kenny Atkinson said. DINWIDDIE STAYS HOT Dinwiddie has registered 20 or points 11 times in his last 13 games.","401161002"
"CHICAGO --  Zach LaVine believes he needs to be a dependable fourth-quarter scorer for the Chicago Bulls to have success. Against Atlanta on Wednesday night, though, he was happy being a spectator. LaVine scored 35 points in three quarters, Lauri Markkanen added 22 and Chicago snapped a three-game losing streak with a 136-102 victory over the road-weary Hawks. LaVine, who sat out the final 14 minutes, was 12 for 15 from the field, including 7 for 7 from 3-point range. ""It feels good; you want to have wins like that,"" the 24-year-old said. ""It does good for the team and the body. I was just more excited about us just keeping the gas on and not have to come back in. ""We played a full game."" Wendell Carter Jr. had 11 points and 10 rebounds and rookie Coby White had 19 points. Trae Young had 15 points and 13 assists, Alex Len scored 17 points and rookie Cam Reddish added 16 for Atlanta, which has dropped two straight and 13 of 15. The Hawks were coming off a 135-121 overtime loss in Miami on Tuesday night -- a game in which they led by six points with less than a minute remaining. Atlanta didn't arrive at its hotel until about 3 a.m. ""We've had our struggles on second nights of back-to-backs,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I thought our guys were competing. It was a great start to the game. I thought it was one of our better starts to the game ... then it's a tough stretch at the end of the first quarter, tough stretch at the end of the second quarter."" Chicago scored the final 10 points of the first half for a 66-52 lead at the break. LaVine led the way with 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting before the intermission. The Bulls continued the surge and took their largest lead to that point, 93-69, on a layup by Carter with 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. LaVine had 17 points in the third on 5-for-6 shooting, including 4 for 4 from long range, as Chicago took a 106-87 lead into the fourth. ""Zach's efficiency was unbelievable,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""He's wants to be great and he's working."" The Bulls, who have blown big leads multiple times, put the game away with a 19-3 run early in the final quarter for a 125-93 lead. It was Chicago's biggest margin of victory since a 39-point win over Brooklyn in April 2017. ""We usually mess up with that,"" LaVine said. ""We finally figured it out today. I think we should have had a couple more wins where we did that. ""Finally, we were able to take a little bit of a break. We have to do more of that."" TIP-INS Hawks: Chicago native and former Bull Jabari Parker had 11 points and seven rebounds in 21 minutes. Bulls: F Otto Porter will be sidelined an additional four-plus weeks after an MRI revealed a small fracture in his left foot. Porter, who hasn't played since Nov. 6, originally was diagnosed with a sprain before a follow-up MRI two weeks later showed a bone bruise. He'll be reassessed in four weeks. ""It's heartbreaking for him and, obviously, difficult for us,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""He's a big wing and a 40% 3-point shooter. His experience, talent, versatility is something we need."" BY THE NUMBERS The announced crowd at the United Center was 15,084 two days following a crowd of 14,775 against the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Before Wednesday, the Bulls were averaging 18,747 per game, but the crowds have been shrinking of late. YOU GOTTA BELIEVE Young's reaction with 59 seconds to go in Miami -- he swung his arms apart and yelled, ""It's over!"" -- received plenty of attention because the Heat scored the next 22 points. Young offered a mea culpa with mostly emojis on Twitter following the game, but coach Lloyd Pierce said he had no issue. ""You gotta love his confidence,"" Pierce said. ""Celebrate. There's nothing wrong with that. It wasn't in anyone's face. He's celebrating his team's success in a position to win on the road.""","401161003"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  With energy on defense and ample shot sharing on the other end, the Utah Jazz discovered the pick-me-up they needed in Minnesota. The Timberwolves would be wise to take notes. Donovan Mitchell had 30 points and six assists, Joe Ingles pitched in a season-high 23 points and the Jazz won 127-116 on Wednesday to stick the Timberwolves with their sixth straight loss. ""We played together, moved the ball, shared the ball, shared everything on both ends,"" Mitchell said. ""That's what makes a good team."" Rudy Gobert added 20 points and 16 rebounds for the Jazz, who won for just the third time in their last nine games by taking over with a 38-24 advantage in the third quarter. Jeff Teague scored 32 points, making all four of his 3-pointers and all six of his free throws, but the Timberwolves dropped their sixth consecutive home game and fell to 3-8 at Target Center this season. They're 7-6 on the road. Andrew Wiggins had 26 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota, but the defense was problematic again, particularly between the paint and the perimeter. ""In the NBA season, there's a number of different tough times, and this is one of them for us,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. The Jazz shot 56.6% from the field. ""The coaching staff has done a great job of putting a system in place,"" Towns said. ""It's more about discipline and execution."" Utah has made its mark on defense under coach Quin Snyder, but that has fallen off lately in a stumble through the last three weeks. Five times in their last nine games, the Jazz allowed 120 or more points, which none of their opponents reached in their first 15 games. They're still eighth in the league in points allowed, but the lackluster communication and decreased intensity has had Snyder concerned. This was a better display, aside from the 36-point second quarter by the Wolves. The Jazz, who had separate spurts of 8-0 and 10-0 in the third quarter to break the game open, kept Towns from getting comfortable. Their ball movement on the other end was the ticket to success, with Jeff Green's corner 3-pointer with 1:58 left in the period a prime example that pushed their lead to double digits for the first time at 90-78. ""Ball movement, talking on defense, being able to get out in transition, and `Big Boy' did his thing locking down Karl,"" Mitchell said, praising Gobert. ""When you do that, it makes our life a lot easier."" Georges Niang tossed in a couple of 3-pointers down the stretch, and the Wolves never gained any more steam. Utah was credited with assists on 15 of 24 second-half field goals. With the Jazz leading 117-102 midway through the fourth quarter, Towns was called for charging after knocking Mitchell over with an elbow to the forehead in the post to negate a basket. ""When we move the defense a little bit, it gives those guys a chance to attack in a better spot,"" Snyder said. ""It was good to see Donovan cutting back and Joe as well being able to find people on the perimeter. I think we had more catch-and-shoot 3s tonight than we did in a while."" TOUGH TEAGUE With rookie Jarrett Culver recently cracking the starting lineup and Saunders preferring to use Wiggins as a primary handler, Teague has had to adjust to both coming off the bench and playing more off the ball. Even if he's in the final year of his contract, in his 11th season in the league, Teague has proven his value beyond just experience, and leadership. He scored 15 points in the second quarter, finishing with a 3-pointer and a reverse layup in the final 32 seconds to forge a 59-all tie. After Mitchell's 3-pointer gave the Jazz a 47-40 lead that was their largest of the half, Teague answered with one of his own just 11 seconds later. He was fighting through a sore left ankle, too, that had him listed as questionable to play earlier in the day. ""He was aggressive, and he was keeping us in the game,"" Saunders said. TIP-INS Jazz: Guard Mike Conley missed his fourth straight game with left hamstring tightness, keeping Ingles in the starting lineup. ... Mitchell shot 8 for 11 from the floor in the first half. Timberwolves: Forward Keita Bates-Diop was scratched with flu-like symptoms, leaving Minnesota a bit thin on the wing. Forward Jake Layman missed his 10th straight game due to a sprained left toe. ... Teague matched his season high and missed his career high by two points, registering his ninth career 30-point game.","401161004"
"PHOENIX --  Rookie Ja Morant had a quiet game by his standards but found himself on the perimeter with 45 seconds remaining, ball in hand and his Grizzlies clinging to a four-point lead. The 6-foot-3 guard dribbled a few times and then blew past Phoenix's 6-foot-10 forward Aron Baynes, who desperately tried to stay in front before Morant elevated and slammed the ball over Baynes' outstretched arms. The Memphis bench howled in delight. A tight game was essentially over and the Grizzlies finished with a 115-108 victory over the Suns on Wednesday night. ""Oh my gosh, I was screaming,"" Memphis guard Dillon Brooks said. ""That's how electric he is. He's a special player -- even if he's having a tough game, he can find a way to electrify. That just put us over the top."" Brooks scored 27 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 and the Grizzlies won two games in a row for the first time in nearly a month. Morant had 13 points, six assists and four rebounds. Jackson shot 10 of 18 from the field, including 3 of 7 from 3-point range, and the Grizzlies improved to 6-0 when Brooks scores at least 20 points. The Grizzlies led 84-79 going into the fourth quarter after Jackson scored 11 points in the third and they pushed their advantage to 91-81 early in the fourth quarter. The Suns pulled within 93-90 with 6:37 left, but couldn't get any closer. ""We were guarding,"" Brooks said. ""We were taking it personal. They beat us at our house, so we wanted to beat them at their crib."" But the game was still in doubt until Morant's poster-worthy dunk. The rookie said the bench was laughing in the aftermath, joking that it took him two months to finally finish a huge slam in a clutch moment. ""It felt good,"" Morant said. ""I feel like everybody knows that's my game. To go to the rack with force and try to finish the play aggressive and was able to get one tonight."" Frank Kaminsky III led the Suns with a season-high 24 points and Ricky Rubio tied a season-high with 22. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 14 points and 13 rebounds. Leading scorer Devin Booker had an off night with just 15 points on 6-of-17 shooting. ""I think we came in complacent thinking it was going to be easier than it was,"" Booker said. ""They came ready to play and credit them for playing hard, but we have to do better."" Phoenix scored the first 11 points of the game but Memphis responded quickly, going on a 25-6 run to take a 27-19 lead by the end of the first quarter. The teams were tied at 51 going into halftime. Kaminsky led the Suns with 15 points in the first half, shooting 6 of 7 from the field, including 3 of 3 from 3-point range. Brooks and Brandon Clarke -- who played high school basketball in Phoenix -- both had 13 for the Grizzlies before the break. BIG BENCH The Grizzlies' got a lot of production from bench players Clarke and De'Anthony Melton. The 6-foot-2 Melton had nine points, six rebounds and three assists and the Grizzlies outscored the Suns by 22 points during the 19 minutes he was on the floor. GOOD STARTS, NO FINISH Phoenix started the game on an 11-0 run, the second quarter on a 7-0 run and the third quarter on a 6-0 run. None of that mattered after the loss. ""That was fool's gold,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said of the initial 11-0 start. ""We just didn't have a defensive focus tonight."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Guard Grayson Allen didn't play because of right ankle soreness. ... Kyle Anderson (heel) played after missing five straight games. He played 12 minutes and finished with three points and four rebounds. ... The Grizzlies improved to 8-16 for the season. Suns: Starting center Deandre Ayton missed the 23rd of his 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's drug policy. He's eligible to return on Dec. 17 in a road game against the Los Angeles Clippers. ... The Suns fell to 11-13 for the season.","401161005"
"MILWAUKEE --  No Giannis was no problem for the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. Reigning league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo sat out but the Bucks kept on rolling, getting 29 points from Eric Bledsoe and 24 from Khris Middleton in a 127-112 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans that extended their winning streak to 16 games. The Bucks (22-3) tied the second-longest winning streak in franchise history and moved closer to the franchise record of 20 set during the team's 1970-71 championship season. Antetokounmpo sat out with a right quad tendon injury, missing his first game this season. ""I think we took a little more ownership of what's going on out there,"" Middleton said. ""When Giannis is out there, he draws such a huge crowd that we play through him a lot. Without him tonight, we know we have to do a little bit more. ""It was a great test; they play with a fast pace just like us. I think we did a great job."" Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova, starting in place of Antetokounmpo, had a season-high 18 points and nine rebounds. George Hill contributed 13 points off the bench. Bledsoe drove aggressively and scored 11 points in the third quarter to answer a Pelicans rally, and he finished making a season-high five 3-pointers and going 10 for 13 from the field while adding six assists. ""I try to get in the paint as much as possible,"" Bledsoe said. ""If I don't have a shot, I kick it out to my teammates and trust them to make the right play."" New Orleans (6-19) lost its 10th straight game despite a season-high 31 points from J.J. Redick. Brandon Ingram had 25 points and 10 rebounds and point guard Jrue Holiday added 21 points. A frustrated Redick spoke up in the locker room at halftime, when New Orleans trailed by 23 points. ""It's not like this is the first time we've had a talk at halftime,"" Redick said. ""I would say emotionally sometimes you reach a tipping point. That's the timing of that."" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said his team needs to communicate better. ""It's the quietest group I've ever been around, even on the plane and in the meal room,"" Gentry said. ""But we do have to get them talking on the court and have them communicate on the court. ""When we do, we're pretty solid. I thought we did a good job in the second half of communicating. But when you're trying to come back from 25 to-28-point deficits, the least little thing is going to have a glaring effect."" The Bucks hit six of their first eight attempts from 3-point range, including 3 of 3 by Bledsoe, to take a 28-12 lead. Milwaukee led by 23 points in the opening quarter before New Orleans closed the period on an 8-0 spurt to pull within 35-20. The Bucks used a 17-0 run to grab a 56-28 lead in the second quarter before settling for a 69-46 halftime margin. Middleton and Bledsoe each had 13 points and Ilyasova and Hill added 11 apiece. The Pelicans outscored the Bucks 40-36 in the third quarter. New Orleans pulled within 120-108 with 2:51 remaining but Middleton hit a pair of jumpers to put the Bucks safely ahead. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans was coming off a two-point home loss to Detroit on Monday and has struggled without No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson, who has missed the first 25 games of the season after undergoing surgery for a torn right lateral meniscus. ""You either win or you learn,"" Gentry said. ""I think the guys are still playing hard. We just have these moments, these stretches where we struggle some and go away from what we're doing."" Bucks: Milwaukee won for the 20th time in its last 21 games and improved to 12-1 at home. The only loss at the Fiserv Forum came in the home opener against Miami. ... The Bucks hit 19 of 39 attempts from 3-point range, one shy of their season high. MISSING GIANNIS Antetokounmpo did not participate in the team's shootaround on Wednesday morning and quickly was ruled out. ""I don't think we know exactly when it happened,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""This morning the soreness was such that he was not able to play tonight. The severity of it, we're hoping it's not too serious. ""We'll take it day by day and we're always going to err on the side of caution."" Ilyasova, the 6-foot-8 veteran, made his first start of the season and responded with 8-of-10 shooting while drawing two offensive fouls and showing his usual energy. ""Ersan is in a great place,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's making a lot of those feel plays, those rhythm plays. The offense is moving a little better recently and I think that suits Ersan. His ability to slip and roll in the pick-and-rolls and work behind the defense, he's just a really smart player.""","401161006"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Buddy Hield was upset about not getting a foul call when Oklahoma City double-teamed him in the final seconds while he was attempting to get free for a shot. When no whistle blew, Hield calmed down and passed the ball to Sacramento teammate Bogdan Bogdanovic. ""I found the best shooter in the gym, so its cool,"" Hield said. Bogdanovic made a 3-pointer with 13.4 seconds remaining and the Kings overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Thunder 94-93 on Wednesday night. It was the second time in three days Sacramento hit a late 3 to win. Nemanja Bjelica's 33-footer at the buzzer lifted the Kings over Houston 119-118 on Monday. They also got a clutch defensive stop from Cory Joseph to hold off the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. ""When you trust the guys you have on the court, sometimes at the end you have to sit back and let them do what they do,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""I enjoy those moments."" Both teams committed turnovers with the game tied in the final minute before Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hit two free throws to put the Thunder up 93-91 with 31.6 seconds left. That came 24 seconds after Oklahoma City failed to advance the ball past midcourt within the allotted eight seconds. We had some opportunities in the fourth to have better possessions offensively, Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. The possessions we had werent good enough. They made some shots that I thought we defended really well, but we didnt close the game as well as we had some other games. Bogdanovic, who missed five of his first six 3s, got the ball outside the arc and paused as Oklahoma City defender Dennis Schroder went flying past him trying for a block. Bogdanovic then hit a 28-foot jumper to give Sacramento the lead. Chris Paul missed a shot from the elbow for the Thunder as time expired. I watch all these games on League Pass night in and night out, and as soon as it left (Bogdanovics) hand you just know it's going in, Paul said. I got to the spot I wanted to. I have to knock that down. Hield had eight of his 23 points in the fourth quarter for the Kings. Bogdanovic scored 17 and Marvin Bagley III added 11 points and six rebounds after missing the previous 22 games with a broken right thumb. It was great, said Bagley, the second overall pick in the 2018 draft. Being back out there after that period of time rehabbing and making sure I was healthy enough to play, it felt good to be back out there playing a game that I love. Schroder had 17 points to lead six Thunder players in double figures. Paul wasnt one of them. Oklahoma Citys point guard had eight points, 12 assists and seven rebounds. The Thunder had won three straight. Sacramento trailed by 14 early in the third but made a late run and cut the gap to 71-69 following consecutive 3s by Hield, who had missed six of his first seven attempts from beyond the arc. TIP-INS Thunder: Schroders three 3-pointers in the first half matched that of the entire Sacramento team. Oklahoma City finished with 13 3s.  Steven Adams had 12 points and 11 rebounds. Kings: Bagleys first shot was an airball and he finished 5 of 13. He was injured in the first game of the season.  Hield missed nine of his first 11 shots.  Sacramento had only three assists in the first half and finished with 12.","401161007"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Warriors coach Steve Kerr liked the comeback attempt he saw Wednesday night from his young Golden State team. That sort of effort just isn't paying off in the win column. Marcus Morris scored a season-high 36 points and the New York Knicks held off Golden State 124-122 in overtime to snap a 10-game losing streak. Golden State (5-21) trailed by 21 in the second quarter but roared back with a second-half rally. The Warriors still lost for the sixth time in seven games and fell behind the Knicks (5-20) for the NBA's worst record. ""At halftime we were down 18, and we were sort of lifeless,"" Kerr said. ""We got back in the game pretty quickly in the third quarter. That's a good lesson for young players in this league. It's a really long game and you have to stay with it."" The Warriors returned from a five-game road trip with optimism, seeing a favorable stretch of schedule ahead that offered seemingly winnable games at home. Over the past three nights, however, they've dropped games to the Knicks and Memphis Grizzlies, who own a combined record of 13-36. Julius Randle had 24 points and 13 rebounds, and rookie RJ Barrett scored 22 for New York, which fought off the Warriors' comeback bid and gave Mike Miller his first win as interim coach. ""We had to bounce back again and again and again,"" Miller said. ""(The Warriors) continued to make plays, continued to stretch the game out. We had a lot of guys contribute and play well tonight."" The NBA's two worst teams staged an entertaining fourth quarter, with D'Angelo Russell hitting a 3-pointer for the Warriors to tie it at 112 with 3.9 seconds left and force overtime. New York controlled the extra period, with Randle's 3-pointer snapping a 114-all tie and putting the Knicks in front for good. Russell finished with 32 points to lead Golden State. The Knicks had their way inside in the first two quarters, shooting 58% and outscoring the Warriors in the paint 32-18. Morris had 18 points as the Knicks took a 68-50 lead into the break. Golden State's cold shooting from Monday's loss to Memphis carried over. Many of those misses came from close range, too, as the Warriors hit just 17 of their 51 shots (33%) in the first half. TIP-INS Knicks: Miller, three games into his tenure after David Fizdale was fired, said the front office hasn't given him any indication whether he'll be leading the team for the rest of the season. ""We're in constant communication. They've been really supportive. It's just been about getting to the next game. I'm fine with that,"" Miller said. Warriors: F Eric Paschall was listed as questionable Wedneday morning with a sore left hip, but he was in the starting lineup for the 19th time in Golden State's 26 games. He scored only five points in just under 17 minutes and was taken out as a precaution when his hip acted up, Kerr said. FILM SESSION Barrett, the No. 3 pick in the draft who has battled through a shooting slump, watched video of his recent play and turned things around Wednesday, going 8 for 16 from the floor and finishing with 22 points for New York. ""I'm just trying to play basketball,"" Barrett said. ""Make the right plays and just get my mojo back, really.""","401161008"
"BOSTON -- Joel Embiid answered the criticism from a couple of Hall of Famers in the most productive way possible. After Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley said Embiid wasn't playing up to his potential, the 76ers center conceded that they were probably right. Then he produced one of his best games of the season: a season-high 38 points along with 13 rebounds in a 115-109 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night. ""All of the stuff he has been dealing with he handled like an adult, with humility. And he responded in a dramatic way,'' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""He was dominant, was a leader and one of his best games as a Sixer.'' Embiid scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, hitting 5 of 6 free throws in the final 26 seconds after Boston scored seven straight points to erase most of a nine-point deficit. With Philadelphia leading by four in the final 15 seconds, he blocked Daniel Theis' shot to help clinch it. Earlier in the week, Barkley said Embiid is the toughest matchup in the league, but he doesn't take advantage of it. O'Neal said on the TNT broadcast that Embiid shouldn't settle for 22 points a game, his current average, but should aim for more like 28 or 30. ""I like when I get criticized,'' Embiid said after the game. ""For them to say I have the potential to be the best player in the world, and I haven't shown that yet, I need to play harder.'' Celtics center Enes Kanter said he approached Embiid during the game and told him not to worry about the criticism. ""He's one of the best big men in the league,'' said Kanter, who scored a season-high 20 points with nine rebounds. ""I told him, 'Hey, don't worry about it.' I told him to just go out and play your game.'' Tobias Harris had 23 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Sixers, who won their fourth consecutive game and their eighth in nine tries. Kemba Walker scored 29 points for Boston, which lost at home for the first time all season. Gordon Hayward scored 19. LATE RUNS After helping the Sixers hang around for three quarters, Embiid dragged them to a 106-97 lead with just over two minutes left. Walker hit three free throws, then Kanter scored on a tip-in and Hayward hit a fallaway jumper to make it 106-104 with 61 seconds left. It was 110-106 when Jayson Tatum made a rainbow 3-pointer over Embiid to make it a one-point game. But Embiid hit his foul shots, and then gave the 76ers a stop on defense to help them pull two games ahead of rival Boston in the Eastern Conference. ""In the fourth quarter, I haven't been the closer these guys have needed me to be this whole season,'' Embiid said. EARLY LEAD  Walker scored 12 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics opened an eight-point lead before Philadelphia scored eight in a row to tie it. Boston scored the final six points of the first and the first basket of the second to make it 36-28, but that lead didn't last, either. It was a three-point game at halftime, then back and forth in the third before the Sixers began to pull away in the fourth. TIP-INS Sixers: Former Celtic Al Horford sat out the game with left knee and hamstring injuries. He received a standing ovation when he was shown on the scoreboard, and he acknowledged the crowd with a wave. Horford spent three seasons with Boston before opting out of his contract and signing with Philadelphia as a free agent last summer. Celtics: Marcus Smart (eye) and Robert Williams (hip) both missed Wednesday's game at Indiana and both were unavailable against the 76ers. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  Cleveland veteran Kevin Love has struggled to find a bright spot during a gloomy season for the Cavaliers, so he created his own. Love hit a tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation and finished with 30 points and 17 rebounds as the Cavs rallied past the San Antonio Spurs 117-109 in overtime Thursday night to stop an eight-game losing streak. ""Hell, yeah,"" Love said when asked about the importance of having fun. ""I think that's what is lost sometimes. It's human nature to feel that way after the losses pile up or you fall on hard times, but I think it's a really long season. You have to find some bright spots and know at the end of the day that if you really love this game, there is going to be ups and downs."" Love had 10 points in the fourth quarter and OT to help Cleveland win for the first time since Nov. 23 against Portland. San Antonio played a third straight overtime game for the first time in franchise history. The Spurs won the previous two at home but failed to maintain a five-point lead with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter this time. DeMar DeRozan had 21 points but missed a pair of free throws with 14 seconds remaining in regulation and the Spurs leading 103-100. ""No excuse why I shouldn't have made those free throws,"" DeRozan said. ""That's just not acceptable on my part."" Love followed by tying the game at 103 on a 3 with 7.5 seconds to go. ""Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, right?"" Love said. ""It was a little bit of a broken play there. Got off a good pump fake. Could have shot it but felt that little pump fake was going to give me a little bit better look, which it did."" DeRozan missed a 20-foot fadeaway jumper at the close of regulation. The Cavaliers opened overtime on an 8-4 run, including back-to-back 3s by Love and Cedi Osman, to capture just their third road win of the season. ""It was a great celebration as a team and you could tell (from) the energy (at the close of regulation that) we were going to come out with the victory,"" guard Collin Sexton said. Sexton had 28 points and San Antonio native Jordan Clarkson added 25 for the Cavaliers (6-19). The duo shot 20 for 37 with only four turnovers. ""We just kept going to the action with both of them in the pick-and-roll and we were able to make some really good things happen,"" Love said. The Spurs outscored the Cavs 35-22 in the fourth period after trailing by 13 in the third. Consecutive layups by DeRozan put San Antonio up 84-83 with 6:23 remaining. It was the Spurs' first lead since Rudy Gay's 3-pointer put them ahead 7-6 with 8:19 left in the first quarter. Derrick White added 17 points and LaMarcus Aldridge had 12 for San Antonio (9-15). ""It's on all of us tonight,"" Aldridge said. ""We let a good opportunity slip away."" Cleveland lost four of its previous five games by 20-plus points but dominated for three quarters. The Cavaliers built a 10-point lead in the second while shooting 47% from the field. ""Cleveland played for 48, we played for 24,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""That's the bottom line."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Their previous victory against the Spurs was March 12, 2015, in San Antonio. ... Dylan Windler missed the game with a lower left leg stress reaction. Windler is the only injured player on the roster. Spurs: Assistant coach Tim Duncan missed the game due to illness. Fellow assistant Mitch Johnson took Duncan's spot on the front row of the bench alongside Popovich and assistants Becky Hammon and Will Hardy. . DeRozan was assessed a technical foul at the close of the first half for chucking the ball high over the backboard from the opposite lane. He appeared frustrated after the Cavaliers scored with 1.1 seconds left in the second quarter after rebounding a missed 3-pointer. WELCOME HOME Playing in his hometown has lost some of its luster for Clarkson, who is in his seventh NBA season. ""I don't have no emotion,"" Clarkson said. ""I'm free of mind. So, it's just like I just come out here and hoop and have fun. It's definitely a big moment for my family coming to see me play on this court. But for me, it's a game.""","401161010"
"MEXICO CITY --  Luka Doncics Spanish was flawless. His game was pretty good, too. Doncic scored 41 points and posted his eighth triple-double of the season, Seth Curry added a season-high 30 points off the bench and the Dallas Mavericks topped the Detroit Pistons 122-111 on Thursday night in the opener of the NBA Mexico Games. Doncic finished with 12 rebounds and 11 assists for the Mavericks, who at 17-7 are off to their best 24-game start since posting the same mark at this point of the 2014-15 season. He picked us apart,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Curry scored 18 points in the second quarter alone for Dallas. The Mavericks trailed by seven late in the first half, then went on a 14-0 run before intermission and eventually led by as many as 24. Curry became the first Dallas reserve to score 30 off the bench since Jason Terry had 34 against San Antonio on Jan. 29, 2012. Even when Detroit was playing zone, our guys were making an effort to drive-and-kick, drive-and-kick and find Seth ultimately for the shot,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. Real happy for him. He did everything. He drove it. He shot it. He made a couple good plays on the breaks. He made a couple good passes. He was a huge contributor tonight."" Doncics eight triple-doubles already match his total from last season. Kristaps Porzingis added 20 points for the Mavericks, who outrebounded Detroit 52-34. I think we're getting better and better every day,"" Doncic said. He's going to get better. I'm going to get better. And with us two, the team is going to get way better."" Andre Drummond led the Pistons with 23 points and 15 rebounds. Derrick Rose scored 19 points and Markieff Morris added 16 for Detroit, which got 12 from Tony Snell and 10 apiece from Christian Wood and Blake Griffin. Back to the drawing board,"" Casey said. Dallas is a great team. Rick's done a heck of a job with that team. But we missed a lot of shots that we normally make. And then defensively, I thought we missed a lot of rotations."" It was the 29th game in Mexico since 1992, the most of any country other than the U.S. or Canada in that span and came on a night where the NBA announced that Capitanes -- a Mexico City-based team in that countrys top pro league -- will be joining the G League starting next season. Playing out here was incredible,"" Drummond said. The atmosphere was outstanding."" Doncic addressed the Mexico City crowd pregame -- to their delight -- in flawless Spanish, before turning the microphone over to Griffin. Hola, Mexico, was the extent of Griffins Spanish offering, as he grinned and a very amused Doncic looked on standing a few feet away. The night didn't get much easier for Griffin from there: He shot just 3 for 16, and 1 for 10 from 3-point range. Doncic, meanwhile, went on to post his second 40-point triple-double of the season. Hes the first player in NBA history to have multiple 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21; he doesnt celebrate that birthday until Feb. 28. TIP-INS Mavericks: It was the third time Dallas played a regular-season game outside of the U.S. or Canada -- the Mavs played Houston in 1997-98 and Phoenix in 2016-17, both in Mexico City. ... NBA Commissioner Adam Silver misspoke before the game at a news conference, introducing deputy commissioner Mark Tatum as Mark Cuban -- the Mavs owner. Pistons: Before Thursday, Detroits only other regular-season game outside of the U.S. or Canada was Jan. 17, 2013 -- a loss to New York in London. ... This was only Detroits second chance at a three-game winning streak so far this season. The Pistons had won two straight before losing to Milwaukee on Dec. 4, and had won two straight again before Thursday. AVOCADO WOES Drummond was a game-time decision because the Pistons said he had an allergic reaction to an avocado. He had swelling around his eyes Wednesday, but played as planned. SECOND GAME San Antonio plays Phoenix in Mexico City on Saturday. Itll count as a home game for the Suns. This is the first time that the NBA has brought four teams to the Mexico games.","401161011"
"DENVER --  With his team well ahead in the final seconds, Nikola Jokic heaved a shot from the top of the key that swished through the net for a 3-pointer. It was that kind of night for the Denver Nuggets. Jokic and Jerami Grant scored 20 points apiece and Denver overcame a career-high 33 by Hassan Whiteside to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 114-99 on Thursday. Gary Harris and Will Barton each added 15 points for the Nuggets, who had lost five of their previous six games and failed to surpass 100 points in four of those losses -- with poor outside shooting a big factor. They were back on target against Portland, making twice as many 3-pointers (18 of 36) as the Trail Blazers (9 of 30). Grant accounted for five of them. ""The main thing is we were making shots and when we make shots, I think we can beat anybody,"" Jokic said. ""When we're scoring, we create open 3s and those are the best 3s."" Denver coach Michael Malone thought crisp ball movement was the key to generating open looks for his team. ""And I liked the fact that guys were stepping into their shot, shooting with confidence, being a lot more shot ready and playing in attack mode,"" Malone said. Carmelo Anthony, who spent the first 7 1/2 years of his career in Denver, received a warm reception from the crowd during pregame introductions. He had 20 points for Portland, and CJ McCollum added 15. Trailing by seven at halftime, Portland cut the deficit to one on Damian Lillard's 3-pointer late in the third quarter. But the Nuggets scored 10 straight points in the last 2:33 of the period, including two 3s by Grant, to rebuild their lead to 89-78 going into the fourth. Barton's 3-pointer with 9:43 remaining put the Nuggets up 96-80, their biggest lead to that point, and Denver maintained a double-digit advantage the rest of the way. ""They made 18 3s the first time we played them (in a preseason game) and they made 18 3s tonight. To me, that was the difference in the game,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Some of it was on us leaving shooters and not contesting as much, and some of it was on them because they moved the ball really well and found the open man."" The final margin was a departure from recent meetings. The previous seven regular-season encounters between the Nuggets and Trail Blazers had all been decided by single digits. Denver, which lost to Portland in the Western Conference semifinals last season, has won the first two matchups this season, including an opening-night victory at Portland that snapped its 18-game winning streak in home openers. Harris hit three 3-pointers in the first half, helping the Nuggets take a 62-53 lead. MEMORABLE MEETING During an early stretch, second-year Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. found himself defending Anthony, one of his childhood basketball inspirations. ""It was crazy,"" Porter said. ""When I first checked in, he was like, 'What's up young fella?' That was definitely cool for me. He was one of my favorite players growing up."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: C Jusuf Nurkic, working his way back from a broken left leg suffered last March, ran the stands at the Pepsi Center during the team's shootaround. Nurkic has been doing conditioning and shooting drills in recent weeks. The team hasn't given a timeline for his return, but Stotts said before the game, ""He is doing everything he is supposed to do behind the scenes."" Nuggets: Jamal Murray was back on the floor after leaving Tuesday night's game at Philadelphia in the opening minutes with what the team described as a ""trunk contusion"" following an on-court collision. Murray finished with 12 points.","401161012"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- James Harden found his 3-point shooting touch -- again. Harden scored 54 points -- matching the team record of 10 3-pointers he set in Houston's previous game -- in the Rockets' 130-107 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. ""I just want to win,"" Harden said simply. ""Whatever it takes."" Harden scored 50 or more for the fifth time this season and the fourth time in his past seven games. The rest of the NBA has combined for only five such games this season. Harden was 10-of-15 from long range and 19-of-31 overall from the field. He also had seven assists, five rebounds and two steals in 36 minutes, receiving a loud ovation from the Orlando crowd when he headed to the bench in the final minutes. ""I feel like we lost against just him tonight,"" Magic guard Evan Fournier said. ""He's the MVP for a reason. We talked about in pregame that he'll take shots, and we'll just live with the results. He did not miss tonight, period."" Harden set the Houston record for 3-pointers with 10 in 18 attempts Wednesday night in a 55-point game in a victory at Cleveland. ""When he's shooting over the top like that, I don't know what you can do,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Russell Westbrook added 23 points for Houston. The Rockets were 22-of-39 from 3-point range, setting a record for the most 3-pointers by any Magic opponent in franchise history. ""We just shot the ball extremely well,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""When James is like that, it's hard for anybody to really beat us -- no matter what kind of defense you're going to throw, we've got guys."" The Rockets pulled away in the second quarter, with Harden scoring 18 points, including Houston's last 11 for a 59-49 lead. Fournier led Orlando with 27 points. Aaron Gordon added 21. The Magic have lost three straight after winning four in a row. TIP-INS: Rockets: Beat the Magic for the 12th time in the past 15 meetings. ... Hold four of the top five spots for most made 3-pointers by a team this season. ... D'Antoni said he assumes his team will play Saturday without Westbrook, who sat out the second game of both of Houston's previous back-to-backs this season. Magic: Orlando was without C Nikola Vucevic for the 11th consecutive game because of a right ankle injury. ... G Markelle Fultz returned after missing Wednesday's game against the Los Angeles Lakers with a stomach virus. ... The Magic held their annual charity golf tournament Thursday to benefit the Orlando Magic Youth Foundation. More than $200,000 was raised.","401161013"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Tobias Harris seems to have found a comfort zone with his offensive game, providing another concern for opponents of the Philadelphia 76ers. Harris scored 31 points, Ben Simmons had 24 points and 11 assists, and the 76ers survived a late scare to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 116-109 on Friday night. Joel Embiid finished with 24 points and 11 rebounds in Philadelphia's fifth straight victory. It was also the 14th consecutive home victory for the 76ers, the franchise's longest streak to start a season since winning 22 straight home games in their NBA championship season in 1966-67. They are now the only undefeated team at home in the NBA after Miami dropped its first home game of the season on Friday night to the Los Angeles Lakers. One night after Embiid put up 38 points and 13 rebounds during a 115-109 win in Boston, it was Harris who became the main scoring threat by rolling outside and taking advantage of some double-teams that the Pelicans threw against Embiid. Harris shot 12 for 20 from the floor, many of them mid-range jumpers. ""I know that when I'm aggressive and getting things in the flow, I'm a very hard player to guard,"" said Harris, who has averaged 23.6 points in seven December contests. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said Harris has been steady. ""He has been so reliable and a go-to guy for us,"" Brown said. ""I put him in a bunch of different spots: pick-and-roll, isolation, 3-ball, and he plays the backdown game. He's having a hell of a year."" Harris was a trade deadline acquisition for the 76ers in February, but seemed to struggle at times fitting into the offensive attack when Jimmy Butler was around. There seems to be an added comfort level in his play this season after re-signing as a free agent in the summer. ""This is one of my best stretches as a player and since being here,"" Harris said. ""I feel like I'm in a good rhythm and balance here. I never want to come off the floor. I want to do what I can to help us win. Just being able to get familiar with guys on this team has helped and continues to increase. Being able to find ways to play with Ben and Joel in pockets of the game has been great. I understand more of what I need to do."" Brandon Ingram scored 32 points and J.J. Redick had 19 for the Pelicans, who have lost 11 in a row. ""We don't have any kind of margin of error,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We missed nine free throws at one point. We can't do that. We have to make those. And there's a couple of plays here and there. Our margin of error is not good enough that we can let those plays go by."" New Orleans briefly took a lead in the third quarter after trailing by as much as 16 in the first half. Philadelphia responded, however, with a 22-11 run to close out the quarter to swell the lead to 92-82 at the end of the period. TIP-INS Sixers: Al Horford missed his second straight game on Friday night with left knee soreness and left hamstring tightness. Horford, who sat out his first game back in Boston Thursday since departing as a free agent in the summer, is averaging 13.8 points and 6.8 rebounds. Horford was listed as day-to-day. Pelicans: Derrick Favors returned to the starting lineup. Favors missed time with a knee injury and following the death of his mother in late November. Favors had eight points and eight rebounds in 15 minutes. . Redick returned to Wells Fargo Center for the first time since signing as a free agent with New Orleans over the summer. Redick was Philadelphia's leading 3-point shooter during his two seasons, shooting 40.8 percent and averaging 17.6 points. A video tribute was played during a timeout in the first quarter and Redick received a standing ovation. . Zion Williamson, the top pick in the draft, missed his 22nd straight game with a right knee injury. There is no timeframe for Williamson's return. SLOPPY FINISH Philadelphia missed nine free throws in the final 3:17 to allow the Pelicans back in the game after trailing by as many as 13 earlier in the period. Embiid also fouled Jrue Holiday behind the 3-point arc with 21 seconds left. The former Sixers guard hit two of three from the line to cut Philadelphia's lead to 112-109. Those mistakes seemed to irritate Brett Brown. ""There are some good things that happened in that game and there are some poor things that happened in that game,"" Brown said. ""My mind is completely on what do we have to do to not be in that situation. Some of it is missing free throws -- a lot of free throws. And we had poor fouls. We fouled them too much when it mattered most in the last three minutes.""","401161014"
"ATLANTA --  Malcolm Brogdon wasn't about to let Trae Young score at will, not after the Indiana Pacers almost lost to the Hawks and their star point guard two weeks ago. ""He's a great shooter, a great player,"" Brogdon said. ""He has the ball in hands the whole game, so you have to be alert the whole time you're out there."" Brogdon had 19 points and 12 assists, Domantas Sabonis had 12 points and 14 rebounds, and the Pacers beat Atlanta 110-100 on Friday night. T.J. Warren scored 18 points as all five Indiana starters finished in double figures. Sabonis, who began the game second in the NBA in double-doubles, has reached the marks in 11 straight games and 21 overall. The Pacers improved to 5-2 this month and 17-9 overall. They are eight games over .500 for the first time this season. Young had 23 points, but missed 21 of 30 shots from the field, as Atlanta lost for the 14th time in 16 games. DeAndre Hunter scored 21 and Jabari Parker 20 for the Hawks. Young finished with 49 points in Indiana's one-point overtime win over Atlanta on Nov. 29, but this time Brogdon helped limit Young in the first half and teamed with reserve point guard Aaron Holiday to stymie him in the second. ""It's a good parallel, me and Aaron,"" Brogdon said. ""I'm a big guard. I can provide the length and bother him with my size. He's a smaller guard who get into him and stay in front of him. He can really harass him."" Atlanta, which dropped to 6-20, began the game ranked last in 3-point accuracy and missed its first 14 attempts beyond the arc. The Hawks finished 6 for 28 on treys with Young missing 10 of 13. ""For me, trying to be one of the closers, I have to be better,"" Young said. ""I was getting wide-open looks and missing. I felt like I let my team down tonight."" Brogdon drove the lane and converted with his right hand against Young to make it 108-100 with 1:09 remaining and hit a pair of free throws to end the scoring with 27.9 seconds left. He was the catalyst on offense. Indiana was coming off a 122-117 home win two nights ago over Boston, its best performance of the season as it beat an opponent that was 17-5 and had won four in a row. Holiday's layup put the Pacers back up by double-digits with 6:55 remaining, but Young answered with a 3 before Hunter's two free throws made it a five-point game. Sabonis, though, followed with a tip-in and then scored close to the rim with a left-hander to make it 101-94 with 4:56 remaining. The Pacers' lead swelled to 18 early in the third, but the Hawks quickly pulled within nine on Parker's fast-break dunk. Cam Reddish's 3 from the left corner trimmed the lead to 81-76 late in the period before Holiday hit a straightaway 3 and T.J. McConnell's 12-footer gave the Pacers an eight-point advantage. Allen Crabbe's 3 from the left wing pulled Atlanta within three entering the fourth. Turner's three-point play put the Pacers up by 17 late in the first half. Indiana let the Hawks score 35 in the third quarter but limited them to 17 in the fourth. ""We want to play draw-and-kick and if they're not stopping us, get to the rim or get to the free throw line,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. SERIES Indiana has won seven straight against the Hawks and 11 of the last 12. The Pacers won 105-104 in overtime at home two weeks ago, rallying from an 11-point halftime deficit and Young's 49 points. TIP-INS Pacers: G Doug McDermott scored 16 points in 29 minutes off the bench. ... G Jeremy Lamb, a starter, had 11 points and has finished in double figures in all but one game this season. ...

"MIAMI --  LeBron James compared the game to a heavyweight fight. If so, then the final punch was thrown by the Miami Heat -- and it missed. Anthony Davis scored 33 points, James had 28 while coming within a rebound of a triple-double and the Los Angeles Lakers held off the Heat 113-110 on Friday night. ""Two teams that are playing extremely well right now in this part of the season,"" James said. ""Two teams that play physical, play together, play hard. That's why they are where they are at this point in the season and that's why we are where we are."" James had 12 assists and nine rebounds and Davis grabbed 10 rebounds. The Lakers improved to 23-3 and remained tied with Milwaukee for the NBA's best record. They also extended the second-longest road winning streak in franchise history to 13 games and rallied from a double-digit deficit to win for the eighth time already this season. It wasn't over until the very last second -- Jimmy Butler knocked over James on his way to getting free enough to take the last shot, but his 3-pointer over Davis' outstretched arm bounced off the rim. ""It's always great to go against a great competitor in our league,"" James said about Butler. Including playoffs, they've squared off 34 times -- going 17-17. Butler led Miami with 23 points, Derrick Jones Jr. had 17, Kendrick Nunn added 16 and Kelly Olynyk had 15 . Bam Adebayo had 12 points and 12 rebounds for Miami, which had been 11-0 at home. ""All things being equal, these are two really good teams playing back and forth,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We were able to create some separation in the first half, and then in the third quarter they were able to impose their will."" The Lakers outrebounded Miami 50-34, and the last of those was the biggest. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a free throw with 8 seconds left to keep the Heat within two, but Miami couldn't get the rebound. Caldwell-Pope went back to the line with 4.2 seconds left, made one of two again and the Lakers' lead was pushed to three. Butler took the last shot for Miami, a 3-pointer with about a second left. It hit the rim and bounced off, the Heat argued that he was fouled to no avail, and the Lakers survived in James' lone trip this season to the city where he won championships in 2012 and 2013. ""We were able to get that stop,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. The Lakers were down by as many as 14 in the first half. James connected on a deep 3-pointer with 8:21 left in the third to tie the game at 65-65, spinning halfway around afterward and punching himself in the chest with both fists as the Heat called time -- after what had been a 10-point lead a mere 3:05 earlier was gone in a flash. Davis hit a 3 on the next possession to put the Lakers on top, JaVale McGee threw down an alley-oop lob from James while getting fouled a few seconds later to push the lead to 71-65, and Los Angeles was suddenly in control. The Lakers' lead got as big as 11 later in the third -- a 21-point turnaround from earlier in the quarter -- before Miami clawed back within three going into the fourth. But the Lakers held the lead the rest of the way. TIP-INS Lakers: When Miami's Chris Silva made a pair of free throws with 4:02 left in the first half, the Lakers trailed 51-41 -- the team's first double-digit deficit on the road in their last 3 hours, 43 minutes and 33 seconds of play. ... James improved to 6-13 at Miami as a visitor. He went 163-35 in home games with the Heat. Heat: Celebrities at the matchup included Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez -- both with personalized Heat ""Vice"" jerseys -- along with Heat legend Chris Bosh, Gucci Mane and DJ Khaled. ... Not only had Miami been 11-0 at home, but the Heat also were 13-1 when leading at halftime and 14-1 in games where they had led by more than 10 points. SPO VS. VOGEL It was the 50th time, including playoffs, that Spoelstra and Vogel went head-to-head -- the majority of those coming in the four-year span where James was in Miami and Indiana was an annual postseason problem. ""It's always a chess match,"" Vogel said. Spoelstra leads the head-to-head, 26-24. GOING HOME James is headed to Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday for a high school game like no other. It pits his alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Mary's of Akron, against Sierra Canyon -- the team featuring, among others, his son Bronny and Dwyane Wade's son Zaire. James said he won't be conflicted. ""I'll be cheering for my son,"" James said.","401161016"
"CHICAGO --  The Charlotte Hornets werent sharp offensively, yet a couple of timely scoring bursts and solid defense helped them to win again. Devonte Graham scored 16 points, Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington each had 13 and the Hornets bounced back after squandering an early 15-point lead, beating the Chicago Bulls 83-73 on Friday night for their third straight victory. The term we keep using is resiliency, Charlotte coach James Borrego said. These guys, we just keep bouncing back. We don't hang our heads. We just keep playing."" The Hornets bounced back twice in this one. After the Bulls rallied with 15 straight points to tie it at 44-all early in the third quarter, Charlotte responded with eight straight. Charlotte led 59-50 after a sloppy third quarter, but Kris Dunns jumper with 5:25 left in the fourth cut Charlottes lead to 66-64. Then, Terry Rozier and Graham hit back-to-back 3s to give the Hornets some breathing room and they held on. It was the lowest offensive output of the season for both teams. Charlottes previous low was 87 points against Boston on Nov. 7. Chicagos low was 84 against Toronto on Oct. 26. The Bulls point total was the lowest in the NBA this season. Charlotte shot 38% from the floor, but the Bulls were even worse at 30% in a choppy game between sub-.500 teams. Bismack Biyombo had 12 points for the Hornets. The Hornets outrebounded the Bulls 60-45, including 49 defensive boards to 34 for Chicago. ""We had probably one of our best rebounding games, Biyombo said. And defensively, we were playing attention to detail. So, overall, it was a great game for us."" Zach LaVine and Ryan Arcidiacono each had 12 points, Thaddeus Young and Lauri Markkanen added 10 apiece as Chicago lost for the fourth time in five games. It seemed like an 80s game, we just couldnt score LaVine said. We didnt let our bad offense affect our defense. That was one thing Bulls coach Jim Boylen said he liked after his team hit only 27 of 90 shots from the floor. Our defense was so good even though we were in transition 63 times, Boylen said. Think about it, 63 missed and our defense was still was where it was at. I am proud of that part of it. Charlotte led 24-15 after the first quarter as Biyombo scored eight points. The Hornets shot 40% in the period, and the Bulls missed on their first seven attempts from the floor, shooting only 28% for the quarter and allowing Charlotte to establish control early. The Hornets picked up the pace in the second quarter and opened a 15-point lead at 44-29 on Roziers finger-roll layup with 2:53 left. But the Bulls reeled off 11 straight points to close to 44-40 at the half. LaVine scored eight points in the quarter, including a running dunk with 27.3 seconds left. Markkanen hit a 3-pointer 14 seconds into the third and Dunn sank a free throw 39 seconds later to extend Chicagos run to 15-0 for a tie at 44-all. Charlotte then countered with eight straight points to restore its lead at 52-44. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum sat out his second game (left hand injury discomfort) and Marvin Williams missed his fourth for right knee soreness.

Bulls: Young entered averaging 21.6 minutes and nine points, his lowest numbers in both categories since his rookie season of 2007-08 with Philadelphia. He played 26:33 in this one. The 31-year-old forward signed a three-year, $41 million deal with Chicago in July after three seasons with Indiana, where he averaged 30.7 minutes last season. LEADING AGAIN Graham led all scorers for a second straight game, but it was quite a drop from his career-high 40 on Wednesday at Brooklyn when the Hornets rallied from a 20-point deficit to beat the Nets 113-108. SITTING OUT While Young got more time and points in this one, Markkanen played 25 minutes, 34 seconds and sat nearly 15 minutes in the second half. The 22-year-old Finn entered playing an average of 29.9 minutes.","401161017"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  After sitting out Milwaukees previous game with right quad tendon soreness, Giannis Antetokounmpo had plenty of energy to lead a fourth-quarter burst that kept the Bucks winning streak alive. Antetokounmpo scored 17 of his 37 points in the final period to help Milwaukee pull away for its 17th straight victory, 127-114 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks outscore Memphis 37-19 in the fourth to pull away. I thought he was fabulous, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said of the leagues reigning MVP. He makes at least one, maybe two 3s, finishing at the basket, and defensively, I think he is doing good things. So, he was just outstanding in the fourth quarter. The Bucks overcame Jaren Jackson Jr.s career-high 43 points. He scored 26 in the third quarter, converting 7 of 11 3-pointers in the third alone, to give Memphis a 95-90 lead heading into the fourth. There hasnt been anything like that, Jackson said of his third-quarter offense, because everything for a minute was going in for me. I felt just like a crazy rhythm and the basket got bigger."" But the Grizzlies couldnt hold on as Antetokounmpo almost outscored Memphis in the fourth on his own. The Bucks improved to 23-3, keeping pace with the Los Angeles Lakers for the best in the league. The Bucks have not lost since Nov. 8 at Utah. We were able to keep our composure, stay together, play together and execute on offense, defend even harder, said Antetokounmpo, who missed his first game of the season Wednesday night against New Orleans. It says a lot about this team. It says a lot about how good this team can be, and how good this team is. Khris Middleton added 26 points for the Bucks, while Eric Bledsoe finished with 12 before leaving in the third quarter with an injury. The 17-game winning streak is second-longest in franchise history, trailing only a 20-game run in the 1970-71 season. Dillon Brooks had 19 points for Memphis, while Jae Crowder had 15 points. Memphis played without star rookie Ja Morant, who took the night off for injury maintenance on a balky back. It took a heck of a fourth quarter from the Bucks to come away with the victory, said Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins, a member of the Bucks staff before taking over the Grizzlies this season. TIP-INS Bucks: Bledsoe left with a right shin contusion.  Antetokounmpo has reached double figures in all 25 games hes played and has 23 double-doubles. ... D.J. Wilson had 11 points, shooting 5 for 7.  Brook Lopez had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Grizzlies: Jacksons 26-point third quarter was a franchise record. The previous mark of 22 points was shared by Troy Daniels and Greg Anthony.  Rookie Brandon Clarke also was out because of a left oblique injury. Clarke ranks fifth in the league  and first among rookies -- in field goal percentage at 63.8%  Jackson has made at least two 3-pointers in seven straight games. He also recorded a block on the night running his string to nine straight game with at least one 3-pointer and one block. SPEAKING FOR JENKINS Jenkins naturally got a clear endorsement from Budenholzer in the Memphis coachs first season. I couldnt be more excited for Taylor, Budenholzer said before the game. I am missing him terribly.  Hes incredibly talented and incredibly gifted. Hopefully, through all of his experiences, he is prepared. But the game also was like watching mirror images of the two teams. We knew what they were doing, and they knew what we were doing, but it is so hard to stop, Antetokounmpo said. They were running our play -- actually their plays -- but it was the same as our plays.  Its fun playing against (Jenkins). FEELING IT Jackson made seven of his first nine attempts behind the arc in the third. As shots started falling in the third quarter, Jackson seemed to go into heat-check, converting shots deeper and deeper on the floor. One from straight away even banked in. That was when Jackson realized he was having a big game. The banker was just like Thank you for the backboard being there because otherwise, I wouldve airballed it. That one was cool.","401161018"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  It's hard to stop Paul George. It's hard to stop Kawhi Leonard. It's really hard to stop both at the same time. George and Leonard showed what the Los Angeles Clippers had in mind when they teamed up the superstar duo Friday night. George scored 46 points, Kawhi Leonard had 42 and the Clippers held on to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-117 for their fourth consecutive victory. ""It's special, two guys offensively,"" George said. ""The thing about it is, we're dishing, finding each other, feeding each other. And then when we have moments to be aggressive, we're looking to get aggressive, attack, look for our shots. It's great when both guys can get it going"" Leonard and George became the first set of teammates in Clippers' history to each score 40 points. It was the 21st time in NBA history it has happened. The last time it was done, it also involved George. He and Russell Westbrook did it for Oklahoma City last season. Leonard and George's previous high this season came Dec. 1, when they combined for 65 points against Washington. ""It's great that we can have somebody else out there to help scoring the ball, making the game easier for myself,"" Leonard said. ""We're still trying to build our chemistry out there."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 39 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota, which lost its seventh in a row. Towns had 14 points, including a 4-point play, in a 22-6 fourth-quarter run that trimmed a 21-point Los Angeles lead to five. Andrew Wiggins added 34 points for the Timberwolves. His basket with 1:04 left cut the Clippers' lead to 119-115. Minnesota didn't get closer than four the rest of the way. ""Disappointed from the loss, but we fought back,"" Wiggins said. ""We were down big. Dug ourselves a hole. We fought back though. We went out swinging."" Leonard and George set the tone early, combining to score the first 23 points for a Clippers team playing without Lou Williams, who sat out with a calf injury. In his absence, George and Leonard accounted for 54 of Los Angeles' 65 first-half points. They became the first duo to each score 35 or more points through the first three quarters of a game in the past 20 seasons, according to ESPN Stats and Info. Leonard made a career-high 19 free throws. He was 19 for 19 from the line. ""That was great,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We knew without Lou tonight, every play was basically for those two guys. And they came up big."" The Timberwolves took a 51-50 lead in the second quarter with a 15-2 run, capped by a Towns 3-pointer. Leonard responded with seven consecutive points to give the Clippers the lead for good. George started the third quarter with a 7-0 run of his own. He scored 16 in the third, when Los Angeles took control by outscoring Minnesota 37-23. ""Forty-six and forty-two, they make it very tough on you,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. Leonard's 31 first-half points set a career high for points in a half. He tied a career high for points in a first quarter with 16. ""We got into our spots early, made shots,"" Leonard said. ""Paul carried us in that second half."" Montrezl Harrell scored 18 points for the Clippers. Jeff Teague scored 22 for the Timberwolves. TIP-INS Clippers: Guards Patrick Beverley (concussion) and Landry Shamet (high ankle sprain) also did not play. Shamet missed his 16th consecutive game. Only four Clippers scored in the first half: Leonard, George, Harrell and Patrick Patterson. Timberwolves: Forward Jake Layman missed his 11th consecutive game with a left toe sprain. Forward Keita Bates-Diop returned to the rotation after missing Wednesday's loss to Utah with flu-like symptoms. All 10 of Robert Covington's points came in the second quarter. OLD FRIENDS Assistant coach Sam Cassell and Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders were assistant coaches on the Washington staff from 2009-14. Cassell also played two seasons for the Timberwolves from 2003-05 when Saunders' father, Flip, was the coach. ""I can go on and on about how good of a person he is,"" Ryan Saunders said.","401161019"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Nearly eight weeks into the season, the New York Knicks finally have back-to-back wins. They did it after falling behind by 16 points, too, 48 hours after taking Golden State to overtime and winning. Elfrid Payton had seven of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, Marcus Morris scored off an offensive rebound with 9.1 seconds left and the Knicks rallied to beat the Sacramento Kings 103-101 on Friday night. ""It's a good feeling,"" forward Julius Randle said. ""We just turned up our intensity and our aggressiveness. The bench did a great job coming in and playing well. We just kept fighting, locked into the details, and came out with a win."" Julius Randle had 24 points and nine rebounds, Mitchell Robinson added 14 points and nine boards, and Damyean Dotson scored 11 points. The Knicks (6-20) hadn't won consecutive games since beating Washington and Chicago in April in their 80th and 81st games last season. This season, victories have been hard enough to come by, let alone stacking them back-to-back. ""We were in positions where we bent a few times but we didn't break,"" New York interim coach Mike Miller said. ""Terrific effort, so many good performances, and showing character to keep coming back when you get down."" Two nights after beating Golden State 124-122 in overtime to snap a 10-game losing streak, the Knicks fell behind 77-61 in the third quarter. New York closed within 80-72 entering the fourth then got on roll behind Payton. Payton made a 4-footer to give the Knicks a 95-93 lead. After Buddy Hield tied it with a long jumper, Payton responded with a 20-foot jumper to put New York ahead for good. Cory Joseph missed a tying 3-pointer for the Kings, and Morris tipped in a miss by RJ Barrett. ""We started locking into detail and then we started getting some stops,"" Payton said. ""We all were out there making plays. Everybody was rolling."" Hield scored 34 points and had a career-high 11 rebounds for Sacramento. Harrison Barnes had 18 points and Nemanja Bjelica added 12 points and seven assists. The Kings had won their previous three. ""We've had some nice emotional wins lately, and in the past that has caused us to have a letdown,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""We built up a nice lead and we didn't maintain it. We fell off. The Knicks imposed their will on us."" The Kings' top 3-point threat, Hield made nine of his first 10 shots and had a pair of dunks on offensive rebounds in the first half. After New York trimmed a 15-point deficit to 52-45, Hield threw a lob pass to Richaun Holmes for a dunk that put Sacramento up by nine at halftime. TIP-INS Knicks: New York had lost four straight against Sacramento. . The Knicks went on an 11-2 run to close the third quarter. . Dotson made a 3-pointer from 33 feet away with the shot clock running down early in the fourth. . Dennis Smith Jr. (illness) was cleared to play but was held out because of coach's decision. Kings: Hield has 10 games this season with five or more 3s. WRONG BUCKET Knicks reserve Kevin Knox was going for a defensive rebound following a miss by Marvin Bagley in the second quarter when it looked like he dunked the ball back in the basket. Replays appeared to show Knox's hand on top of the ball before it went in, although Hield was credited with the points.","401161020"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Golden State worried so much about defending Donovan Mitchell that Bojan Bogdanovic repeatedly found himself wide open on the perimeter. That turned out to be just what the Utah forward needed to overcome a recent shooting slump. Bogdanovic made a go-ahead basket in the final two minutes, hit eight three pointers and scored 32 points to help the Jazz beat the Golden State Warriors 114-106 on Friday night. Mitchell added 28 to help Utah win for the third time in four games. While going 8 for 13 from 3-point range, Bogdanovic encountered token resistance much of the time. ""They were more scared of Donovan than my 3s,"" he said. ""That was their game plan."" Getting in the win column proved tougher than expected. Utah did not take the lead for good until Bogdanovic and Mitchell hit back-to-back 3-pointers with 1:18 remaining that gave the Jazz a 109-104 lead. Bogdanovic shot 61.5% from 3-point range and went 8 of 18 overall after shooting under 40% from the field in five of his last six games. That slump is a memory now. ""He's a big part of our offense,"" Mitchell said. ""He's confident shooting the ball. I told him, 'You can go 1 for 26. No one cares. Just shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot.' And that's what he did."" Rudy Gobert added 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz. Joe Ingles chipped in 13 points and eight assists, and Royce O'Neale added 14 points. Alec Burks scored 24 points and Damion Lee added 21 for the Warriors. D'Angelo Russell added 18 points. Golden State lost despite outscoring Utah 52-12 in bench points. Still, the Warriors showed enough promise to make head coach Steve Kerr believe they are turning a corner. ""So, I like where we're heading. I really do,"" Kerr said. ""I know that may sound crazy, because of our record, but I think we're going to start winning some games. I think we're getting better."" Golden State got a big lift from its bench starting in the waning minutes of the first quarter. The Warriors held Utah without a basket over the final four minutes of the quarter. That opened the door for a 9-0 run, capped by a step-back jumper from Russell just a few seconds into the second quarter that gave Golden State a 31-22 lead. Golden State totaled eight offensive rebounds in the first quarter while holding Utah to seven total rebounds. ""The offensive rebounds really hurt us in the first half,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Those were additional possessions. Golden State makes you expend a lot of energy in the half court guarding them and then they go to the boards."" The Warriors led by as many as 13 points during the second quarter. O'Neale buried a 3-pointer and threw down a dunk to help the Jazz trim the deficit to 41-37. Golden State countered with a 9-0 run, scoring baskets on four straight possessions. Burks punctuated the run with a jumper that gave the Warriors a 50-37 lead. Utah came alive in the third quarter behind the perimeter shooting of Bogdanovic. He buried back-to-back 3-pointers to fuel a 14-4 run that gave the Jazz a 76-68 lead. ""Our energy was completely different in the third quarter,"" Bogdanovic said. Golden State went ahead once again early in the fourth quarter when Russell started a 7-0 run with a 3-pointer that put the Warriors up 91-88. FEELING AT HOME Burks was a standout once again on a return trip to Salt Lake City. He averaged 22.0 points on 50% shooting over two road games against the Jazz. The Warriors guard spent eight seasons in Utah, appearing in 382 games and averaging 9.6 points. Some of Burks' ex-teammates remain on the roster and that familiarity has bred success for him in a normally tough road venue. ""In eight years here, I scored on every one of them, more than a few times,"" Burks said with a laugh. ""It's always fun to play against those guys."" BATTLING FOR BOARDS Golden State finished with a 48-43 rebound advantage against Utah. The Jazz came away feeling good about it after recovering from a sluggish start on the glass. The Warriors outrebounded Utah 26-16 in the first half. The Jazz picked it up in the second half and edged Golden State 27-22 on the boards. They limited the Warriors to four offensive boards after halftime. ""We could have easily said 'Here we go again' down at home to a team we should beat,"" Mitchell said. ""For us to be resilient and continue to fight just shows the progress we've made."" TIP INS Warriors: Draymond Green (rest) and Eric Paschall (left hip soreness) did not play. . Marquese Chriss matched his career-high with 13 rebounds. Chriss also scored 12 points. ... Golden State totaled eight offensive rebounds in the first quarter while holding Utah to seven total rebounds. Jazz: Mike Conley (left hamstring tightness) and Tony Bradley (illness) were inactive. Conley missed his fifth straight game. . Ingles has dished out at least eight assists in four of the last six games. . Utah outscored Golden State 11-4 in fast break points.","401161021"
"MEXICO CITY --  San Antonio set a record. Patty Milly got the Spurs a win, too. Mills made a jumper from the free throw line with 0.3 seconds left in the Spurs' record-setting fourth consecutive overtime game, and they outlasted the Phoenix Suns 121-119 on Saturday. The NBA record book shows 20 instances of teams playing three straight overtime games -- but never four straight, like the Spurs have. They're 3-1 in those games, their best stretch since opening the season 4-1. ""We've had four overtime games in a row now and we've won three of them and I think there's something positive to be said for that,"" Mills said. ""Tonight it was the execution. We haven't had the greatest of seasons but we're learning as we go."" DeMar DeRozan pulled the Spurs even with a drive and fling -- after a foul by Mikal Bridges -- down the right side of the lane, but missed the free throw. The ball went out of bounds on a scramble after the missed free throw, and San Antonio kept the ball after a replay review. Phoenix, with star guard Devin Booker sitting out because of a sore forearm, overcame a late seven-point deficit to force overtime on Kelly Oubre Jr's 3-pointer from the corner in the final seconds. Mills led the Spurs with 26 points. ""If it doesn't go in, then it doesn't work,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said about Mills' winner. ""This one happened to go in."" DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge and Dejounte Murray each added 18 for San Antonio, and Lonnie Walker IV had 16 on his 21st birthday. Ricky Rubio had 25 points and 13 assists for Phoenix. Frank Kaminsky added 22, and Oubre had 17. ""With Devin out, we knew Ricky was going to have to have a big game,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""And he just kept making play after play after play. ... But as a young team, Ricky's a guy that we rely on in a lot of situations."" MORE GAMES IN MEXICO Saturday was the 30th game -- 10th of the regular-season variety -- that the NBA has held in Mexico, and Commissioner Adam Silver said more are being planned. The Mexico City-based Capitanes team will join the G League next year, and Silver said that move may mean the NBA pivots back to bringing preseason games to Mexico going forward. ""If we bring preseason games, which we have in the past, we can work in conjunction with our G League affiliate, work to grow the game and spend more time in the community,"" Silver said. Besides the two regular-season games -- Dallas beat Detroit on Thursday night -- and the G League announcement, the NBA also opened Mexico's first NBA Store on this trip. The 2,000-square-foot space opened in Mexico City's upscale Polanco neighborhood. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio has been below the .500 mark for more days this season than it has been in the previous 10 seasons combined; 32 and counting this season, 28 in the previous decade. The Spurs will soon spend their 100th day with a losing record over the last 22 years -- amazingly, every other team in the NBA has spent at least 1,000 days below .500 in that span. Suns: This was the next-to-last game in Deandre Ayton's 25-game suspension without pay after testing positive for a diuretic. He can return Tuesday night when Phoenix visits the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Phoenix has played 20 times outside the U.S. or Canada, with the majority of those appearances coming in either Mexico or Italy. The Suns have played in those nations six times each. GLOBAL POP Mexico becomes the fifth country in which Popovich has coached a game in 2019. The list: the U.S., Canada (San Antonio played at Toronto on Feb. 22), Australia (USA Basketball played three games there in August before the World Cup), China (where the U.S. finished seventh at the World Cup), and now Mexico. He'll add Japan to the list next year during the Tokyo Olympics. HELLO, AGAIN Williams played for Popovich in San Antonio, began his coaching career with the Spurs as an intern in 2004-05 -- a title year for the silver and black -- and had been a vice president of basketball operations in San Antonio from 2016 through 2018. Phoenix's next game is a reunion of sorts for Williams as well; the Suns play Monday night against Portland, the team that gave him his first assistant coaching position in 2005.","401161022"
"TORONTO --  One huge quarter from 3-point range helped the Toronto Raptors halt a rare home losing streak. Pascal Siakam scored 30 points, Marc Gasol set season highs with 17 points and 15 rebounds and the Raptors beat the Brooklyn Nets 110-102 on Saturday night to snap a three-game slump on their home court. ""Our overall feel-good was there tonight,"" Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. Norman Powell fouled out with 25 points and Lowry had 17 to help the Raptors win their ninth straight home game against the Nets and beat Brooklyn for the 16th time in 17 meetings. ""I really think tonight's game was fuelled by the defense we had,"" Powell said. Serge Ibaka had 12 points and 12 rebounds as Toronto extended an NBA record by winning its 34th straight at home against a division foe. The Raptors are unbeaten at home against Atlantic Division opponents since a Nov. 10, 2015, loss to the New York Knicks. The Raptors made nine of 12 attempts from 3-point range in the first quarter, including their first seven straight. ""It gave us some good energy to start to shoot the ball so well,"" coach Nick Nurse said. The hot shooting didn't last, and Toronto went 5 for 28 from distance the rest of the way. ""We've just got to keep shooting, keep getting shots up and playing aggressive,"" Lowry said. Toronto came in having made 27.2% of its 3-point attempts in its previous five games, four of them losses. The Raptors made a season-low seven 3-pointers Monday night in a 93-92 win at Chicago. Wednesday's loss to former teammate Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers was Toronto's third straight at home after a franchise-record nine consecutive home wins to begin the season. The Raptors hadn't lost three straight at home since Nov. 29 to Dec. 5, 2015. Siakam topped 25 points Saturday for the first time in six games. Toronto lost four of the five games in which Siakam failed to score at least 25. ""Our energy was where we want it to be,"" Siakam said. ""We made a lot of mistakes but we covered it up with our energy."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 26 points, Garrett Temple added 16 and Taurean Prince had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who are 0-4 on the road against opponents with winning records. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said sloppy ball handling and poor outside shooting was too much to overcome against the defending NBA champions. Brooklyn shot 12 for 46 from long range, with Temple missing 12 of 14 attempts. The Nets also made 20 turnovers, leading to 29 points for the Raptors. ""When you have 20 turnovers and then you miss the amount of shots we did, it's just not good enough,"" Atkinson said. Temple couldn't convert a three-point play after making a layup to begin the fourth, and Powell scored five points as Toronto replied with a 9-0 run, taking a 99-85 lead with 8:32 left to play. Nine of Toronto's 12 field goals in the first were 3-pointers, one shy of the team record for a single quarter. Siakam had 14 points in the first as the Raptors overcame an early 12-2 deficit to lead 38-31 after one. ""Credit to them being locked in from the jump,"" Prince said. TIP-INS Nets: Jarrett Allen had 10 rebounds, extending his career-best streak of 10-plus rebound games to 10. It's the longest streak by a Nets player since Reggie Evans did it in 18 straight in 2012-13. . Brooklyn's 59 rebounds were a season-high. . The Nets are 3-7 against opponents with winning records. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (right knee) missed his third straight game. . Gasol had a career-high 17 rebounds against Charlotte last Jan. 23. SHORT REST The Nets play again in less than 24 hours, hosting Philadelphia at 6 p.m. on Sunday. ""It's part of the job,"" Allen said. ""We've been built to play basketball. We condition our bodies to be able to do this and let's just go play tomorrow."" DOUBLY DISAPPOINTING Brooklyn, which led by 10 points early, couldn't hold a double-digit lead for the second straight game. The Nets saw a 20-point lead slip away in Wednesday's 113-108 home loss to Charlotte. REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVING With his 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's drug program complete, the Nets will have Wilson Chandler active for the first time Sunday. Prince said the veteran forward will provide defensive toughness and 3-point shooting. ""He makes good decisions on offense, doesn't really step outside of his game,"" Prince said.","401161023"
"CHICAGO --  After blowing several late leads to lose games, the Chicago Bulls were able to flip the script Saturday night. Zach LaVine scored 31 points and converted a decisive three-point play in the Bulls' 109-106 victory over the short-handed and weary Los Angeles Clippers. Chicago trailed by five points with less than two minutes to go. Tied at 106, the Bulls inbounded with 5.4 seconds left. LaVine got the ball near the 3-point line, drove to his right and was fouled by Montrezl Harrell as he scored with 2 seconds left. Paul George then missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""We made big plays,"" LaVine said. ""I think that's what it comes down to, making plays. ""We've been playing good, but we just haven't been able to get that win in the last two minutes, three minutes of the game. Hopefully, we can start stringing some together."" Lauri Markkanen had 13 points and 17 rebounds, Thaddeus Young scored 17 points, and Denzel Valentine had 16 for the Bulls. Harrell had 30 points and George had 27 for Los Angeles. The Clippers had won four in a row. Besides playing for the third time in four days at the end of a six-game trip, the Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard (injury management, left knee soreness), Lou Williams (right calf), Patrick Beverly (concussion) and JaMychal Green (tailbone contusion). This was the eighth game Leonard has missed. He scored 42 points Friday night at Minnesota. George was asked if the poor finish was a result of fatigue. ""Not necessarily,"" he said. ""This isn't new. We just got outplayed tonight."" Los Angeles led by 15 points midway through the second quarter before Chicago closed the first half with a 19-6 run to pull to 57-55. The Bulls continued the surge early in the third, scoring 17 straight points for a 75-61 lead. The 75 points were two more than Chicago scored Friday night in an 83-73 home loss to Charlotte. The Clippers answered with a 12-1 run to trim the deficit to 76-73 and pulled to 81-79 in the final minute of the third on a three-point play by Harrell. LaVine then hit a 3-pointer to give Chicago an 84-79 lead entering the fourth. In the final three minutes, George hit a pair of free throws to break a tie at 98 and Landry Shamet hit a 3-pointer for a 103-98 Clippers lead with 2 1/2 minutes remaining. With L.A. up by five a minute later, LaVine and Valentine hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions -- sandwiched around one of two free throws by George -- for a tie at 106 with 47.9 seconds left. TIP-INS Clippers: G Shamet returned after missing a month (17 games) with a high right ankle sprain. He finished with 11 points in 21 minutes. Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder sprain) missed his ninth straight game. He hasn't been cleared for contact and there is no timetable for his return. ""He shot earlier today, he got some three balls up, so that was encouraging,"" coach Jim Boylen said. WINNING PLAY The Bulls had planned to hold for the last shot, but that changed when George got caught out of position, clearing the path for LaVine. ""I just saw the one-on-one with Montrezl, so just go in there with a strong finish, try to get to the line,"" he said. ""I was able to come up with the and-one."" When asked what created the lane, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said: ""It was created by bad defense."" QUICK TURNAROUND The start of Friday night's game at Minnesota was pushed back nearly two hours to accommodate national TV, so the Clippers had less recovery time than a typical back-to-back. ""Our league has been great, but today's game, in my opinion, should not be played or happen,"" Rivers said. ""When you play basically an 8:45 p.m. game and then have to fly and get to your hotel at 3:45 and go to bed at 5, you probably shouldn't be playing basketball the next day -- especially if they're talking about our health."" HE SAID IT When asked if an 82-game regular-season schedule was too much, Rivers said: ""I don't know. If you see me walk, clearly 82 games is not healthy.""","401161024"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Rookie Ja Morant is drawing the accolades for the Memphis Grizzlies. Fellow first-round pick Brandon Clarke is showing his value as well. Clarke, who leads the league's rookies in field goal percentage at 65%, scored a season-high 25 points, converting 11 of 14 shots and the Grizzlies sent Washington to its fourth straight loss, beating the Wizards 128-111 on Saturday night. While Dillon Brooks led Memphis with 27 points, Clarke continued his accurate shooting touch, including making his only 3-point attempt. Clarke's play has been rewarding for Memphis. The 6-foot-8 forward from Gonzaga appeared undervalued on draft night last summer, dropping to 21st before Oklahoma City drafted Clarke and the Grizzlies immediately traded for him. ""Whoever passed up, messed up,"" said Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who had 16 points. ""He's definitely a Top 10 pick, if you're re-drafting this,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Clarke said the secret to his accuracy is built on work, particularly from 3-point range where he is 13 of 25 this season. ""Hard work and getting the reps and being comfortable shooting in the game,"" Clarke said. ""It took time in our practice, but now it feels really comfortable to shoot that wide-open 3."" Morant added 18 points to help the Grizzlies win for the third time in the last four. Memphis would set a season-high with points in the paint (70), and Clarke's 25 points helped the Grizzlies establish a season-standard for bench points with 59. ""That's been a problem,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of the points in the paint. ""I told our guys, I know we are short-handed, but we still have to be able to scrap. We did not scrap. enough."" Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 29 points, but was 8 of 23 from the field. Troy Brown Jr. had 16 points, while Ish Smith and rookie Admiral Schofield scored 14 each for Washington. Memphis built its lead late in the first half and then extended it to 21 early in the third. Solomon Hill, who was scoreless in the first half, converted all four of his 3-point shots in the third, as Memphis led 104-84 entering the final frame. The Grizzlies would stretch the advantage to 24 in the fourth. ""We haven't lost like this in a long time,"" Beal said. TIP-INS Wizards: C Moritz Wagner was out with a left ankle sprain. With Wagner out and Thomas Bryant suffering from a stress reaction in his right foot, little-used Ian Mahinmi was the only true center available and started. ...Beal had 10 rebounds to record his sixth double-double of the season. Grizzlies: F Jae Crowder did not play, suffering from left ankle soreness. ... The victory snapped a seven-game home losing streak. ... Memphis is 7-0 when Brooks scores at least 20. .The 17-point victory matched the largest over the Wizards in franchise history. The other 17-point win in the series was four years ago on Dec. 14, 2015 JAPANESE CONNECTION Wizards rookie Rui Hachimura and Grizzlies two-way player Yuta Watanabe were on the court at the same time in the second quarter, marking the first time in an NBA regular-season game that two Japanese-born players appeared in the same game. TOUGH NIGHT FOR BERTANS Davis Bertans who had 32 points in Tuesday's game at Charlotte, was held to nine points. He had reached double figures in 12 of his previous 13 games. Against Memphis, he was 2 of 9 from the field and made only one of his six 3-point shots. ""It's bound to happened,"" Brooks said. ""The guy has been on fire. He's been knocking down everything once he has stepped on the court. ... He will bounce back."" THOMAS CLOSE TO RETURN Wizards guard Isaiah Thomas, who was listed as questionable before the game, did not play, missing his fifth straight with a left calf strain. Thomas was a game-time decision. ""He's getting better, and that's the good thing,"" Brooks said of the decision to sit Thomas another game. ""He had a good workout (Saturday). It was close. He wanted to go once again, but that's the way he is. We just have to be careful.""","401161025"
"DALLAS --  A Dallas crowd stunned by Luka Doncic's ankle injury and the big deficit that followed was standing with the Mavericks in position to win late. Still, a huge comeback without the young phenom came up short. Doncic left in the opening minutes with a sprained ankle and the Mavericks rallied from 24 points down to take a lead into the final minute of regulation before falling to the Miami Heat 122-118 in overtime Saturday night. Bam Adebayo put Miami in front for good on a put-back dunk with 1:15 remaining in overtime and finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his second triple-double in three games. ""Anytime you lose your best player, the way he's been playing, it's rough,"" said guard J.J. Barea, a big part of the rally with 12 points in 13 minutes. ""But yeah, I think we did a great job. Everybody that came in stepped up and we put in a great effort."" Doncic's right foot landed on the foot of Heat guard Kendrick Nunn on a drive less than two minutes into the game. The reigning rookie of the year lost control of the ball for a turnover and limped off the court before going down behind the basket while play continued at the other end. He got up a short time later but went straight to the locker room. The team said X-rays were negative, but he didn't return. Doncic was playing two nights after the 20-year-old dazzled the crowd in Mexico City with a pre-game speech in Spanish before scoring 41 points with 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 122-111 victory over Detroit. It was his NBA-leading eighth triple-double of the season. The Slovenian guard entered the game averaging 30.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 9.3 assists per game while leading the resurgent Mavericks to the Southwest Division lead. While stressing it was just his opinion, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said he doesn't expect Doncic to play Monday at Milwaukee. ""If you play hard and do the right things for 48 minutes, you're always going to have a chance in this league,"" Carlisle said. ""We got plenty on this roster to win a game like this, even with Luka out. We just got to do better."" Without Doncic, Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 18 of his 28 points in the second half to help Dallas rally, but was shut out in overtime. Kristaps Porzingis, the other half of Dallas' star European pairing with Doncic, had 22 points and 14 rebounds but couldn't convert on two possessions late in the extra period. Then the 7-foot-3 Latvian gave up an offensive rebound after Jimmy Butler missed two free throws with nine seconds remaining. With another chance after another foul, Butler made two free throws for a three-point lead, and Jalen Brunson missed a 3-pointer just before the buzzer. Butler led Miami with 27 points, and Tyler Herro scored 19 as the Heat again avoided back-to-back losses for the first time this season. It was Miami's first win in five tries on the second night of a back-to-back, coming off a 113-110 loss to LeBron James and the Lakers at home. ""Obviously, the game looked totally different without Doncic there,"" Heat coach Eric Spoelstra said. ""But regardless, this team, the guys in that locker room, we needed a breakthrough. We've been playing horrible basketball on the second night of back-to-backs."" The Mavericks trailed by four when Doncic went down and the deficit ballooned to 19 in about five minutes and reached 24 in the second quarter. But Dallas wiped out a 23-point halftime deficit and the led twice in the fourth quarter, including 112-108 before the Heat scored the final four points of regulation. Hardaway missed a runner in the final seconds of regulation before Butler misfired on a pull-up 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""It's tough, especially winning on the road,"" Butler said. ""They're a good team, even without Luka. My prayer's out for him. I hate to see people go down, especially him and the year he's having. I was looking forward to the matchup."" Porzingis gave a stunned crowd the first chance to cheer by making a 3-pointer from the logo at center court to beat the first-quarter buzzer. TIP-INS Heat: Miami has won five straight games in the series. ... Butler extended his streak of games with at least 20 points to eight, the longest since Dwyane Wade had eight in March 2015. ... Adebayo also had two blocks. ... Kelly Olynyk had 17 points and eight rebounds. Nunn scored 13. Mavericks: Delon Wright returned after missing two games with a right abductor strain, going scoreless in nine minutes. ... Brunson had 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. ... Maxi Kleber, whose dunk gave Dallas its first lead at 104-103 with 4:28 remaining in the fourth quarter, scored a season-high 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting. BUSY BUTLER Butler played at least 40 minutes for the third time in five games, finishing at 43 minutes while going 1 of 6 from 3-point range while making 10 of 12 free throws. In the two games that fell short of 40 in the past five, Butler played 36 and 37 minutes. TALE OF TWO HALVES The Heat shot 63% from 3 (12 of 19) in the first half before 4 of 21 after halftime. Duncan Robinson and Butler combined to go 1 of 11 from beyond the arc in the second half and overtime. Robinson was among five Miami players with at least two 3s before halftime.","401161026"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo displayed his remarkable skills early and often as the Milwaukee Bucks continued their quest to break a franchise record that has stood for nearly half a century. The reigning MVP sank a 3-pointer for his first points of the game, then followed with a spinning layup, a wide-open dunk and a step-through slam for nine quick points to give Milwaukee an early lead. And when the Cleveland Cavaliers made it close in the second quarter, Antetokounmpo streaked down the court, received a feed from Donte DiVincenzo and threw down a one-handed dunk as the Bucks began to pull away. Antetokounmpo and the Bucks went on to beat Cleveland 125-108 Saturday night, their 18th consecutive win. ""You can try to game plan for Giannis and you can try to game plan for a team like that, but they're very long, they can shoot the ball and they can play inside out,"" Cavaliers forward Kevin Love said. ""They are on a major winning streak right now and they're playing some of the best, if not the best, basketball in the NBA."" The Bucks have won 22 of their last 23 and improved to 24-3, one-half game ahead of the idle Los Angeles Lakers for the best record in the league. The Bucks have not lost since Nov. 8 at Utah. The streak is the second longest in franchise history. The Bucks won 20 consecutive games in the 1970-71 season on the way to winning their lone NBA championship. ""When we run and our pace is really fast, everyone gets easy ones, and everyone gets open shots,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It just makes the game fun. And when the game is fun, I think everyone defends, also."" Kevin Porter Jr. had 15 points and Jordan Clarkson scored 13 for the Cavaliers, who grabbed a brief lead in the second quarter on a jumper by Clarkson but were then outscored 34-14 to close the period. The Bucks' lead grew to as many as 28 points in the third quarter, and they cruised the rest of the way for their 13th straight win at home. ""They're explosive in offensive transition,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""We have to do a better job there collectively. That lead can explode on you in a minute."" Cleveland, which had ended an eight-game losing streak with an overtime win over San Antonio on Thursday night, committed 18 turnovers that the Bucks converted into 21 points. ""Our turnovers are killing us right now,"" Beilein said. Love had 12 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland. Antetokounmpo, who missed his first game of the season Wednesday night against New Orleans, played just 24 minutes, while Middleton, who had 26 points on Friday night, played 23. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Dylan Windler is being re-evaluated for a stress reaction in his left leg. The team's first-round pick this year has yet to play for Cleveland. ""He really could give us a spark right now,"" Beilein said. ""I really feel bad for him. We'll let him go dormant for a couple weeks, see if it's nothing."" ... Ten players scored in the first half, but none reached double figures. Thompson and Darius Garland each had eight. ... John Henson, who hadn't made a 3-pointer this season, connected on back-to-back shots from deep in the fourth quarter.

The man crawled off the court before being immobilized and was carried away on a stretcher by emergency medical personnel. FINDING MOTIVATION Budenholzer said players have found their own motivation during the lengthy win streak. ""I'm not a big motivator,"" he said. I think (general manager) Jon (Horst) and the front office, we try to find guys that are competitive and self-motivated because I'm probably terrible at (motivating).

"HOUSTON --  When the Detroit Pistons had a comfortable lead entering the fourth quarter Saturday night, coach Dwane Casey knew the Houston Rockets would make a run late and he'd need someone to step up to hold them off. He got that boost from Derrick Rose, who came off the bench to score 10 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter to help the Pistons outlast the Rockets 115-107. ""That's what you've got to have and that's what his league is about is having players that can create their own shot,"" Casey said. ""And he did that. He was tough downs the stretch."" Luke Kennard scored 22 points as the Pistons didn't trail in the last two quarters and were up by double figures for most of the second half. Houston used a 9-2 run, with a 3 from Chris Clemons, to cut the lead to 112-107 with 41 seconds remaining. But Tony Snell made two free throws after that and Bruce Brown made one of two free throws after a miss by Houston to secure the victory. James Harden led the Rockets with 39 points after two straight 50-point games, but it wasn't enough to keep Houston's winning streak going on a night Russell Westbrook sat out to rest. Harden played 38 1/2 minutes, but was taken out with 1:23 left and didn't return. ""Our 3s were short and James got beat up and tired,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said of Harden, who played 36 minutes in a win over Orlando on Friday night. ""He carries a big load, but there were other things that needed to happen that just didn't happen for us."" Rose had 12 assists, Bruce Brown had 16 points and 10 rebounds and Markieff Morris added 15 points as the Pistons won for the third time in four games. Casey gave Brown credit for making things tough on Harden. He made just 14 of 33 shots. ""What Bruce did to pick up full court for every minute he was in there was a man's job because you're tired,"" Casey said. ""He's a little bit more tired because he played last night but it takes discipline and a lot of grit."" The Rockets used a 5-0 run to cut the lead to 8 with two minutes left. But Detroit got baskets from Rose and Kennard after that to push the lead to 110-98 with about 90 seconds to go. Detroit led by 12 after a 6-0 run capped by two dunks from Brown before the Rockets used a 7-2 spurt to get within 98-91 with about five minutes left. An 8-2 run by the Pistons, with the last six points from Rose, came next to push the lead to 106-93 with 3 1/2 minutes to go. The Pistons led by 10 at halftime and opened the second half with a 7-2 run to push the lead to 69-54 with about eight minutes left in the third. Detroit was still up by 15 later in the third quarter before the Rockets made the next eight points, with six from Harden, to cut it to 80-73 with three minutes left in the quarter. But the Pistons scored the next six points, with a 3 from Morris, to push the lead to 86-73 with about a minute left in the third. Detroit led 88-75 entering the fourth.

"DENVER -- Breaking out of a mini-slump, Nikola Jokic is reasserting himself as the centerpiece of the Denver Nuggets' offense. Jokic had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists for his fourth triple-double of the season, leading the Nuggets past the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-102 on Saturday night. Jokic now has 32 regular-season triple-doubles to tie Rajon Rondo for 11th on the career list. The stat line signaled his return to form after a series of off-target shooting performances and sluggish ball movement that bogged down the Nuggets' attack over the last two weeks. ""He's definitely well past rounding back into form,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""For Nikola, getting past those struggles that everybody goes through, it's just handling that adversity, staying with it and finding a way to stay aggressive, knowing that's the only way you're going to right the ship."" Jokic was effective from the perimeter and the low post, hitting three 3-pointers and muscling in a pair of dunks. When the defense collapsed on him, he was dishing off to the open man and figuring prominently in all five Denver starters scoring in double figures. Will Barton had 18 points and Jamal Murray scored 14 as the Nuggets beat the Thunder for a seventh straight time. ""When (Jokic) is aggressive, it just opens up everything for everybody else,"" said Gary Harris, who finished with 11 points. ""We were all clicking today. He was able to get assists, rebounds, points. He was able to do whatever he wanted."" Said Jokic: ""I've been playing like that my whole life, so it kind feels like I'm playing the way I'm supposed to play."" Dennis Schroder had 22 points to lead the Thunder. Steven Adams had 18 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 16 for Oklahoma City. Chris Paul finished with 15 points and 10 assists. ""I think it was a game where we just didn't shoot well,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""This was a game where we needed to have our defense be really elite, but we had some breakdowns, some missed opportunities, some blown coverages, and we couldn't overcome those things."" Leading by three at the break, Denver used a 12-2 burst late in the third quarter to take a 77-62 lead. Abdel Nader had the Thunder's lone basket in that span while Murray highlighted the Denver surge with a lob off the backboard that he put back through the net with a two-handed dunk. Torrey Craig later hit a 3-pointer and Juancho Hernangomez had a driving layup to help Denver take an 82-68 lead into the fourth quarter. The Thunder narrowed the deficit to five points on a jumper by Gilgeous-Alexander with 6:50 left to play, but the Nuggets then scored nine straight points, including a dunk and 3-pointer by Jokic for a 102-88 advantage with 4:35 remaining. The Thunder couldn't mount another threat. The Nuggets got off to a hot start, opening a 22-6 lead early, but the Thunder steadily gained on them and Adams' dunk pulled Oklahoma City within 52-49 at halftime.

"NEW ORLEANS -- Jonathan Isaac had 21 points and 10 rebounds and the Orlando Magic beat New Orleans 130-119 on Sunday, sending the Pelicans to their franchise-record 12th straight loss. We just got to play better. We got to play better, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. We just got to keep competing, and well try to get it figured out. Gentry was ejected late in the third quarter after receiving two technical fouls for complaining about officiating. It was his first ejection of the season. Orlando center Nikola Vucevic returnd from a sprained ankle to score 20 points. He played 29 minutes in his first game since Nov. 20. Im really happy to finally be back, Vucevic said. His teammates were thrilled to have the All-Star center back. He just knows how to play, Isaac said. Hes a great player. I think he slows the game down for us, and his ability to just bail us out with post-ups and knocking down shots is really (important for us). The Magic snapped a three-game losing streak. Jrue Holiday led the Pelicans with 29 points and eight assists. J.J. Redick added 23 points against the team that drafted him in the first round in 2006. Its hard to lose. Its also hard to win, so I feel like we got to just try to stay positive, Holiday said. The Magic led 58-57 at halftime and pulled away with a 41-point third quarter. Isaac had 11 points in the quarter. Orlando made a season-high 17 3s, shooting 50% from long range. The Magic shot 51.2% overall from the field and had just eight turnovers. TIP-INS Magic: D.J. Augustin had 17 points, and Even Fournier added 16. On Saturday night, Augustin, a New Orleans native, became the first athlete in any sport to have his jersey retired at Brother Martin High School. Augustin, who wore No. 14, led the school to two Louisiana state championships and is the programs career scoring leader. Pelicans: Brandon Ingram added 21 points, but early foul trouble limited him to 27 minutes.  Guard Josh Hart scored 20 points.  Before the game, Gentry reiterated the team is being overly cautious with No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, who has yet to play this season due to a knee injury. Hes still in the rehab stage of it.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Aaron Holiday didnt offer much of an explanation for his recent scoring surge that has helped the Indiana Pacers win three consecutive games. But theres no denying the second-year reserve guard has had a hot hand lately. On a Sunday when the Pacers relied heavily on their bench, Holiday scored 12 of his game-high 23 points in the final quarter of a 107-85 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Holiday, who entered with a 9.3-point average, had his third consecutive double-digit game and was a point shy of a career high set last month at Brooklyn. He was coming off games of 18 and 13 points. Im just playing, he said. My teammates did a good job of finding me in the right spots and I was able to knock some shots down for them. If he was certain of anything, it was that his team needed to regroup entering the fourth quarter after almost blowing a 15-point halftime lead. The cold-shooting Hornets managed to trim their deficit to 70-66 with a 22-13 third quarter. Once they cut the lead down, we just had to calm down and get back to playing the basketball we were playing before, push the pace and play defense, Holiday said. The Pacers finished the final frame with a 35-19 edge. Thirty-one of their points came from the bench, which provided 55 for the game. Reserve guard T.J. McDonnell also had 12. Those guys have been playing good since getting their opportunity, Pacers coach Nate McMillan said of his bench players. Theyve been a spark for us this short season, bringing energy to the game, a pace that speeds us up. Doug McDermott, a reserve guard who had not scored in three quarters, helped with a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth. By the time Holiday hit his second 3-pointer of the game, the Pacers had a 93-75 lead with 4:54 remaining. The Pacers held the Hornets to a season-low in points and shooting percentage (30.8). The visitors had a three-game winning streak snapped. Theyre a very good team, theyre deep, their bench is one of the strengths so they played well, give them credit, Hornets coach James Borrego said. They made shots and unfortunately we just didnt get enough stops there down the stretch. Pacers center Myles Turner scored 14 points with 10 rebounds. Domantas Sabonis added 12 points and 12 rebounds. Hornets forward Cody Zeller, a Hoosier native who typically plays well in front of family and friends, had 19 points and 12 rebounds. He accounted for eight of the teams 20 points in the opening quarter. If you would have told us wed win three in a row, I think wed be happy with that, Zeller said. It will be good to go back home off a pretty good road trip.","401161031"
"ATLANTA -- LeBron James finished off a whirlwind weekend with another dazzling performance. Not looking the least bit tired, James scored 32 points and the Los Angeles Lakers extended their winning streak to seven with a 101-96 victory over the pesky Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night. The Lakers pulled even with Milwaukee for the NBA's best record at 24-3. ""Highlights: sometimes they happen, sometimes they don't,"" James said. ""I try to play the game with a lot of joy."" After scoring 28 points in a win at Miami on Friday night, James flew to Columbus, Ohio, to watch son Bronny play a high school game Saturday night. Then, James traveled on to Atlanta to face the struggling Hawks. He never considered sitting out. ""I don't know how many games I've got left in my career,"" the 34-year-old James said. ""I don't know how many kids show up to come see me play. ... That's my obligation. My obligation is to play."" The Hawks kept it close all the way. Vince Carter passed up an open layup and dished to rookie Cam Reddish in the corner for a potential tying 3-pointer, but the shot clanked off the rim. Danny Green went to the other end and knocked down a pair of free throws to send the Hawks to their fourth straight loss. ""We did our best to compete,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I'm proud of our guys."" If the home team was hoping to get an off night from James, he quickly dispelled that notion. James had the crowd -- many of them decked out in his No. 23 jersey -- oohing and ahhing with an appropriate 23-point effort in the first half. He threw down three thunderous slams. He knocked down a couple of mid-range jumpers. He ventured out beyond the arc to swish a couple of 3-pointers -- including a step-back shot from nearly 5 feet behind the stripe to finish off the first half, sending the Lakers to the locker room with a 55-48 lead. He also had seven rebounds and blocked a shot, but the play that really had everyone talking was an assist -- a no-look, between-the-legs pass that caught Dwight Howard breaking down the lane for a massive dunk. Rondo also contributed to the ""Showtime"" performance, finishing off a four-on-one with a dazzling move that looked as though he was about to throw up a lob to James streaking off the wing. The lone defender, De'Andre Hunter, was left reeling as Rondo hung on to the ball for an uncontested layup. James flew in behind his teammate like he was going for the block, adding some style points to an already impressive play. James wasn't done. In the third quarter, he pulled up just inside the Hawks center-court logo and swished another 3-pointer from 36 feet to give the Lakers a 10-point edge. ""He was spectacular,"" Laker coach Frank Vogel said. ""He had some all-time clips."" Atlanta trailed by as many as 11 but kept the margin in single digits nearly the entire way. Trae Young led the Hawks with 30 points. Anthony Davis scored 27 points and grabbed 13 rebounds for the Lakers. James also had 13 rebounds, along with seven assists. HUERTER'S SHOULDER Kevin Huerter's left shoulder is hurting again. The Hawks guard re-injured his left shoulder about 4 minutes into the fourth quarter when he collided with Howard. ""I was trying to box him out and the arm kind of went limp,"" Huerter said. He was holding his left arm gingerly after the game, but the team doesn't believe the injury is as serious as his previous one. Huerter already missed 11 games with a strained left rotator cuff. ""We'll know more tomorrow,"" he said. ""We haven't done any tests yet."" TIP-INS Lakers: Davis grabbed at his right ankle when fouled on a lay-up in the closing minutes, but he was able to finish. ... Rondo was slapped with a technical late in the second quarter for griping about being called for a foul on Young.

Hawks: Pierce picked up a technical in the first half for arguing that a Lakers block should have been called for goaltending. ... Atlanta was outrebounded 56-42. ... The Hawks shot just 36 percent from the field. Young reached 30 points for the 13th time this season but was held to 9-of-22 shooting, including 3 of 11 from 3-point range.

"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie has been on the receiving end of some friendly banter from his Brooklyn teammates, especially Kyrie Irving, over not using his athleticism to rise above the rim. He took the opportunity on Sunday night against the 76ers and former teammate Tobias Harris, scoring 24 points and riling up the Brooklyn bench with an impressive jam on an inbound pass from Garrett Temple, as the Nets went on to beat Philadelphia 109-89. ""We showed it again in the locker room in the end and they got a big kick out of that,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I don't think people realize how good an athlete Spencer is. You could argue our best athlete. He's fast. He's got an incredible vertical. He's unbelievable. It doesn't surprise me. I wish he'd do it more."" Joe Harris scored 16 points, DeAndre Jordan had 13 points and 11 rebounds and Temple finished with 13 points for the Nets, who ended a two-game skid. Dinwiddie credited Temple's pass for his rim-shaking moment. ""Honestly it was a great pass by GT (Garrett Temple). I believe he threw it right over Tobias' ear,"" Dinwiddie said. ""I wouldn't have dunked it if they hadn't been calling fouls. So I was like, `Oh, OK, he's under the rim, he'll probably foul me.' But then I was like, `Man, I ain't gonna get no free throws out of this."" With All-Star center Joel Embiid sitting out with an upper respiratory illness, the 76ers did not have much of an answer for Dinwiddie and the Nets, who scored 64 points in paint. Ben Simmons scored 20 points and Tobias Harris chipped in 17 for the Sixers, whose five-game winning streak ended. ""He's aggressive. He's very talented. He gets downhill, loves downhill,"" Simmons said of Dinwiddie. ""He just plays. He plays with the freedom. I love the way he plays, but he dominates."" It was the first regular-season meeting between the teams since last April, when Philadelphia eliminated Brooklyn from the first round in Game 5 of the playoffs. Philadelphia looks much different this time around, having since added Al Horford to its interior game while losing Jimmy Butler as a free agent to Miami. Brooklyn was finishing a back-to-back after losing at defending NBA champion Toronto on Saturday night. The 89 points allowed to Philadelphia marked the fewest given up by the Nets this season. Brooklyn got a needed lift from its bench, with reserves scoring 23 first-half points en route to a 57-43 lead at halftime. For the game, the Nets bench outscored Philadelphia's 40-23. Dinwiddie's dunk midway through the third quarter sparked the Nets, who blitzed Philadelphia with a 10-0 run, capped by his pass to Jarrett Allen for an alley-oop jam that stretched the lead to 76-58 with 3:03 left. The 76ers didn't do themselves any favors during that stretch by missing seven shots. ""They're really hard to guard, especially Spencer Dinwiddie's ability to get into the paint,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. BACK IN UNIFORM F Wilson Chandler made his season debut for Brooklyn after serving a 25-game ban for using performance-enhancing drugs. Before taking the court, he gushed over his second chance after he was suspended August 29 for taking Ipamorelin. Chandler, who was signed to a one-year deal in July, was forced to watch his new team's games at home or at a restaurant. The 12-year veteran checked into the game with 5:26 remaining in the opening period and finished with two points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes. ""Having to watch those games, being away from the team, I was just hoping I could be out there and help at some point,"" Chandler said. TIP-INS 76ers: Horford played with a sore left knee and left hamstring. He finished with 10 points on 5-for-15 shooting from the field and added nine rebounds and five assists. . Philadelphia struggled with its 3-point shooting, making 5 of 26 attempts. . The 76ers, who have not lost a home game in 14 tries, dropped to 6-8 on the road. Nets: Dinwiddie has scored more 20 points in each of Brooklyn's last four games. He's notched 17 20-point games this season after doing so 18 times last year. HOME SWEET HOME Brooklyn improved to 10-5 against Philadelphia at Barclays Center, matching the most wins the team has recorded against any team at home since the team moved from New Jersey in 2012. The Nets are 10-2 against Orlando in Brooklyn.","401161033"
"DENVER --  Little went right for the Denver Nuggets in a rough third quarter. They made up for it with a big finish. Nikola Jokic scored 11 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, including a late go-ahead 3-pointer, to help the Nuggets hold off the New York Knicks 111-105 on Sunday night. ""That third quarter, we defended absolutely nobody,"" said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, whose squad blew nearly all of a 16-point halftime lead while being outscored 33-20 in the third. ""What I liked about that fourth was 21 points allowed, 29 percent shooting from the field (by the Knicks). Our defense stepped up when it needed to. Offensively, guys stepped up and made some plays and made some big shots."" Will Barton had 16 points, Gary Harris added 15 and Jamal Murray had 14, including a key 3-pointer in the late going. The Nuggets, who led by as many as 20 points, hung on for their 12th straight victory over the Knicks in Denver. ""We just stuck with it,"" Murray said. ""We know how good of a team we are. I think we just took it to another level in terms of our intensity and focus, especially in those last seven minutes."" Marcus Morris led New York with 22 points. The Knicks were coming off back-to-back road wins under interim coach Mike Miller. They played Denver 11 days ago in New York and lost by 37 points, a setback that preceded the firing of David Fizdale as coach. Miller said he liked the way the Knicks fought back to make a game of it. ""We put ourselves in a good position,"" Miller said. ""If we can put ourselves in the position where, with four minutes to play, we have a chance to win, then we're doing what we need to do."" Taj Gibson banked in a shot to put the Knicks up 91-89 with 9:50 left to play their first lead since the opening minutes. New York led by as many as five points before Denver came back to tie it at 98 on Barton's 3-pointer. Jokic connected on a 3-pointer and Denver regained the lead at 102-100. His driving layup with 24.4 seconds left capped an 11-0 run that stretched Denver's lead to 109-100. ENCOURAGING TRIP The Knicks finished 2-2 on their four-game West Coast swing, including winning successive games for the first time this season. ""We grew a lot this road trip,"" said Julius Randle, who finished with 20 points. ""Being able to come out .500 on a road trip is always good. We gave ourselves a chance to make it a great one, being up four late in the fourth. We didn't capitalize and missed some easy shots. They made shots and we lost. We get to come home and give ourselves a chance to start up again and play good again."" TIP-INS Knicks: Guard Allonzo Trier was inactive for a second consecutive game because of a concussion. Nuggets: Forward Paul Millsap missed a second straight game because of a right quadricep strain.","401161034"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  The Sacramento Kings flipped the script Sunday night in their one-sided rivalry against the Golden State Warriors. Bogdan Bogdanovich scored 25 points and Buddy Hield added 19 as the Kings routed the Warriors 100-79. Sacramento won for the fourth time in five games and shook off a disappointing home loss Friday to the lowly New York Knicks. The Kings also took a step in reversing the storyline against their Northern California rival, beating the Warriors for just the fourth time in the past 25 games between the teams dating to the 2013-14 season. ""I thought our guys were making the right pass, the extra pass,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""It shows what kind of shooting (we can have) when we play that way."" Sacramento improved to 12-14, holding Golden State to 39% shooting. The Warriors have lost eight of nine to fall to 5-23. The Kings thrived offensively, displaying excellent ball movement and shooting a season-best 60% from the field. The 79 points allowed also was a season-low for an opponent. Things could get better for the Kings, too, as their roster gets healthier. Second-year big man Marvin Bagley III, who had 17 points Sunday, recently returned from a broken thumb. Sacramento also expects to get starting point guard De'Aaron Fox back from a severely sprained ankle in the next week or so. Fox has missed five weeks. ""I'm just getting back, and to have him come back not too long after me, it'll be great for us,"" Bagley III said. ""We'll kind of get back to what we were doing before all the injuries happened."" The short-term future isn't as promising for Golden State, which because of injuries is just a shell of the team that's gone to five consecutive NBA Finals. Golden State was 6 of 25 from 3-point range Sunday and matched its season low for points in a game. Sacramento turned the ball over 29 times, yet the Warriors couldn't make the Kings pay. ""I've never seen a box score like this, where we forced 29 turnovers but lost by 21 points,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It shows you how poorly we played. Our decision-making was awful. It was an embarrassing loss tonight."" Willie Cauley-Stein, facing his former team, led the Warriors with 14 points on 7-for-9 shooting. Sacramento ended all doubt after halftime, outscoring Golden State 28-17 for the third quarter to command a 79-59 lead. TIP-INS Kings: Bagley III has played center since returning two games ago, and Walton said he envisions that continuing for the foreseeable future. Walton cited the Kings' success playing ""small-ball"" recently, and he thinks Bagley can be more effective in the pick-and-roll at the center spot. ... Sacramento's 29 turnovers were an NBA-high for any team this season. ... On the bright side, the Kings notched 27 assists. Warriors: Surprisingly, Golden State's 18 points in the first quarter weren't a season low for the opening period. That came Oct. 30 with 14 vs. Phoenix. ... F Eric Paschall missed his second game in a row with left hip soreness, but Kerr anticipates the rookie returning Wednesday against Portland. LINEUP SHUFFLE Golden State trotted out its 14th different starting lineup in 28 games this season. Damion Lee started at shooting guard in his first start as a Warrior and contributed 13 points, 10 of them in the first half. Glenn Robinson III slid from shooting guard to small forward with Paschall out.","401161035"
"DETROIT --  The Washington Wizards hardly missed during the first quarter, shooting 81% from the field. Then in the final period, they nearly repeated that feat. Bradley Beal scored 35 points and Isaiah Thomas added 23 to lift the Wizards to a 133-119 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. Washington led 43-31 after the first quarter, and after the Pistons rallied, the Wizards shot 78% from the floor in the fourth. Beal and Thomas each scored 11 points in the fourth and missed only one shot between them in that quarter. ""Brad's going to be Brad, so he's going to do what he's been doing all year, his whole career,"" Thomas said. ""Slowly, I'm feeling like myself more and more."" Thomas returned from a calf injury, while the Pistons were without injured stars Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. Washington shot 17 of 21 from the field in the first quarter. The Wizards made all three of their 3-point attempts and all six of their free throws in the opening period. ""You give a team 43 points in the first quarter, that's the game,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""You let a team see the ball go through the basket, a team that's been struggling. They lost how many straight?"" The Wizards snapped a four-game losing streak, and the Pistons failed to build on their victory at Houston on Saturday night. Detroit rallied after falling behind by 16 in the second quarter, but the Wizards were relentless offensively. Davis Bertans added 17 points for Washington. Derrick Rose and Markieff Morris each scored 22 points for Detroit. It was 67-61 at halftime, and Washington led 96-91 after three. In the final quarter, the Wizards' lead stayed between two and five until Beal's two free throws made it a six-point game with 5:20 to play. Thomas then added a 3-pointer to make it 117-108. The Wizards shot 14 of 18 in the final quarter and ultimately won comfortably. ""We couldn't get stops all game, couldn't get stops when they were shooting 3s,"" Morris said. ""It wasn't just in the fourth. They figured out how to get their best players involved."" Griffin has been dealing with a sore left knee, and Drummond missed a second straight game with left eye inflammation. BENCHES The Pistons and Wizards both came into the game averaging 46 points from their reserves -- two of the top marks in the NBA. In this game, Washington narrowly won the battle of the benches, 50-49. ""Both teams were out there scrambling and trying to figure out a lineup with all the injuries,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks, whose team has been missing star guard John Wall all season. ""We made enough plays and passed the ball and made some big shots."" BEEN A WHILE According to the Play Index at Basketball-Reference.com, this was the most points the Pistons allowed in regulation since 1995, when Seattle scored 134 against Detroit on March 12 and 133 against the Pistons on March 18. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington went 18 of 33 from beyond the arc in its 17th straight game with at least 10 3-pointers. ... Thomas missed five games with his calf injury. ... Rookie Rui Hachimura left with a groin injury after scoring seven points in 17:01. Pistons: Bruce Brown scored 20 points, two short of his career high.","401161036"
"TORONTO --  Raptors coach Nick Nurse expected guard Norman Powell would lose his starting spot once Fred VanVleet was healthy. Powell's recent offensive outburst is forcing Nurse to reconsider. Pascal Siakam scored 33 points, Kyle Lowry had 20 points and 11 assists, and Toronto beat the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers 133-113 Monday night. Powell scored 26 points, Serge Ibaka had 14 and OG Anunoby 12 as Toronto set a season-high in points and won for the eleventh time in 14 home games. The Raptors have won back-to-back at home after losing three straight here. Powell has scored 20 or more points in three straight games for the first time in his career. He scored 20 or more four times in 60 games last season. Lowry said it's the best string of games he's ever seen from Powell. ""Great stretch right now,"" Lowry said. ""He's shooting the ball confidently, pushing it in transition. I think he's understanding how to play in transition a lot better now."" Nurse echoed Lowry's praise. ""What I like is the speed at which he sees the open floor and goes for it,"" Nurse said. VanVleet has missed four straight games because of a sore right knee but is getting closer to a return. Whether he comes back as a starter or a bench player remains to be seen. For his part, Powell doesn't mind whether or not he starts. ""I'll do whatever helps the team,"" he said. ""Coming off the bench or starting, it doesn't matter to me as long as we're winning."" Lowry's double-double was his 110th with Toronto, tying Antonio Davis for third-most in franchise history. They trail Jonas Valanciunas (137) and Chris Bosh (239). The double-double was Lowry's second in seven games since returning from a left thumb injury that sidelined him for 11 games. ""I'm getting a little bit better,"" Lowry said. ""Still need a little bit of time, but I'm getting a little bit better."" Collin Sexton scored 25 points, Darius Garland had 20 and Tristan Thompson 18 as the Cavaliers lost for the 16th time in 18 games. Cleveland has dropped two straight after winning 117-109 at San Antonio on Thursday night to snap a season-long eight-game skid. ""They're just a really good team and certainly a better team than us tonight,"" Cavs coach John Beilein said of the Raptors. The Raptors scored eight points off six Cavaliers turnovers in the first quarter. Love led the Cavs with seven points in the first, and Cleveland closed the quarter with a 10-0 run but still trailed 37-29. The Cavaliers made only two turnovers in the second but couldn't close the gap on Toronto. Powell scored six points in the quarter and the Raptors led 66-54 at halftime. Powell drew gasps for his one-handed slam dunk from Siakam's high lob pass in the third. Powell scored 16 points in the quarter, and Siakam added 13 to give the Raptors a 104-84 lead. ""It was good to show that I've still got the bounce,"" Powell said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland is 1-8 against Atlantic Division opponents. ... The Cavaliers are 3-11 on the road. ... Cleveland has lost seven of eight games in December. ... The Cavaliers finished with 11 turnovers, leading to 18 points for the Raptors.

TAKE CARE Toronto's seven turnovers were a season-low. The Raptors had two turnovers in the first half.","401161037"
"HOUSTON --  After Houston completed the biggest comeback in franchise history, Russell Westbrook was asked about the key to the win. The star guard didn't speak for several seconds. He simply patted his chest several times, crediting the Rockets' heart for the victory. Westbrook scored 31 points, James Harden had 28 and Houston set a franchise record by overcoming a 25-point deficit to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-107 on Monday night. Sometimes you've got to want it more than the other team, Westbrook said. It's that simple. No plays or no possessions or no shots can change that. The comeback eclipses the 23-point deficit Houston faced in a 110-107 victory against Portland on Jan. 22, 1977. The game was tied with 2 1/2 minutes remaining when Houston's P.J. Tucker hit a 3-pointer from the corner. A layup by Rudy Gay got the Spurs within one with just under a minute left before Harden missed a 3 on the other end. A 3-pointer by Bryn Forbes rolled on the rim before bouncing out, and Harden made two free throws to extend the lead to 109-106 with 16.2 seconds left. Forbes missed another 3 with 10 seconds left, but the Spurs got the ball back when Clint Capela knocked the the ball out of bounds while fighting for a rebound. The Rockets then intentionally fouled two times, and Derrick White made a free throw before purposely missing the second one with 2.7 seconds left. But Westbrook grabbed the rebound to secure the win. Houston fell behind early in a game where Harden had just nine points on 4-of-17 shooting in the first half. He warmed up after the break and finished 10 of 29. My confidence is never gone, no matter if I go 0 for 20 or whatever, he said. I'm always going to shoot the ball and be aggressive. Early my shot wasn't falling ... and then other guys stepped up. The Spurs managed just 35 points after setting a season high for first-half scoring. LaMarcus Aldridge led San Antonio with 19 points and 13 rebounds, and Forbes had 18 points. Some ways it's like your worst nightmare to go up 20 quickly because you know the thing is going to turn to some degree, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. So the way it was an even game down the stretch is pretty much what you'd expect most of the time."" It was the first meeting between the teams since a 135-133 win by the Spurs in double overtime on Dec. 3 in which a dunk by Harden was wrongly disallowed, leading to a protest by the Rockets. Houston lost the protest, which would have resulted in part of the game being replayed. But the league said it disciplined the officials who got the call wrong and botched the aftermath by not allowing Houston to challenge the ruling. The Rockets cut the lead to three on a dunk by Capela with about 10 minutes left before DeMar DeRozan scored four quick points to stretch it to 93-86. A 13-4 run by Houston made it 99-97 with five minutes to go, lifting the Rockets to their first lead since 2-0. The Rockets got four points from Danuel House and a 3 from Harden in that stretch while the Spurs missed seven shots. DeRozan tried to explain how things went so wrong for the Spurs after the break. They just picked it up, he said. We kind of slacked. It's always hard playing with a lead. Every single quarter, you have to play even harder, because nobody wants to get embarrassed. The Spurs were up 72-53 at halftime. THEY SAID IT Popovich on if playing four straight overtime games caught up to the Spurs on Monday night: How would I know that? Is there a way to gauge that? Right. TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray received a technical for pushing Harden in the first quarter. Harden also got a technical. ... White had 16 points off the bench. Rockets: The Rockets made just 11 of 43 3s. ... Capela had 15 points and 15 rebounds.","401161038"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  This time, Ja Morant and Memphis landed the final punch against Miami. Morant had 20 points and 10 assists to lead the Grizzlies to a 118-111 victory over the Heat on Monday night. Jonas Valanciunas finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds as Memphis won for the fourth time in five games. De'Anthony Melton scored 16 points, and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 15. The Grizzlies also played Miami in their season opener on Oct. 23, losing 120-101 when the Heat rallied in the fourth quarter. The Heat put together another big finish Monday night, but the Grizzlies responded with their own push. ""We just learned,"" Morant said of the difference since the first game of the season. ""I feel like we lost a lot of games late in the fourth quarter. A team would go on a run, and we weren't able to bounce back from it. ... We're just learning from our mistakes."" Miami had won four of five, including three overtime victories. Jimmy Butler had 25 points and eight assists, and Tyler Herro scored 22 points. ""Our (man) defense was pretty poor all the way through,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""The zone defense gave us a little bit of life. I don't know if it was because it got them out of rhythm or because we were just more active."" The Grizzlies were up by 11 when Butler went on his own 7-0 run in the fourth. Derrick Jones Jr. then scored five points to help Miami take a 107-104 lead with 5:30 left. Memphis responded with 11 straight points for a 115-107 lead on a Morant drive with 2:31 left. Jones finished with 15 points for Miami, and Bam Adebayo recorded his sixth straight double-double with 14 points and 13 rebounds. It was Miami's first loss of the season to a sub-.500 team. ""Even in the midst of the second half (the Heat) were going on, you wouldn't believe the communication the guys had,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""No one was overthinking it and putting their heads down, which were some of the moments earlier in the season."" BAM AWARD Adebayo was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week earlier Monday after averaging 20 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.7 assists in three games last week. ""I love it. I love it for him,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's all about the right things. This won't go to his head. It's not like he is doing this for individual accolades.""

"MILWAUKEE --  The Bucks have little time to reflect on the end of their 18-game winning streak. Milwaukee's impressive run was halted Monday night when Seth Curry and Kristaps Porzingis each scored 26 points to help the Dallas Mavericks hang on for a 120-116 victory even without star guard Luka Doncic. Milwaukee, which dropped to 24-4 with its first loss since a 103-100 setback Nov. 8 at Utah, next hosts LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers (24-3) on Thursday in a matchup of conference leaders. ""It's going to be a test for us,"" said Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 48 points and 14 rebounds. ""The Lakers are one of the best teams in the league. We've got to play good basketball. We've got to move the ball. Obviously as a team, we don't want to lose two in a row."" The winning streak was the Bucks' longest since a franchise-record 20 consecutive victories by the 1970-71 championship team that featured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, and Oscar Robertson. Dallas led comfortably for most of the fourth quarter until the final half-minute. Tim Hardaway Jr. hit the second of two free throws to make it 119-114 with 7.6 seconds left. Antetokounmpo scored on a layup and was fouled, but missed the free throw. Sterling Brown grabbed the offensive rebound, but his putback was blocked by Porzingis. ""I'm proud of the way the guys fought to the very last second tonight,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""To find a way to be close in the fourth quarter and have an offensive rebound and give ourselves a chance, I think it's just a sign of the competitive nature of this group."" Doncic sat out with a sprained right ankle, while the Bucks were missing injured point guard Eric Bledsoe. Milwaukee trailed 86-76 entering the fourth quarter and pulled to 99-92 before Porzingis hit back-to-back 3-pointers from long range. The Bucks got no closer until the final 23 seconds. Dallas was 16 of 41 from 3-point range, including four 3s each by Curry and Porzingis. The Bucks went 11 of 41 from beyond the arc. ""I hit those two deep 3s but even then, Giannis was right there in front of me,"" Porzingis said. ""They know we are a pretty good shooting team. But we have so many weapons and anybody on any given night can score 20-plus points. That's the dangerous thing about us. Tonight, Seth played great. It's kind of hard to play against a team that has so many options."" Kyle Korver added a season-high 17 points for Milwaukee, including five 3-pointers. Milwaukee trailed 69-67 when Antetokounmpo went to the bench with 6:32 left in the third quarter, having scored all 11 of the Bucks' points in the period. Dallas led 75-69 when Antetokounmpo returned after a two-minute breather, and the Mavericks pushed the margin to 80-69. Dallas was 7 of 13 beyond the arc in the first quarter en route to a 36-22 lead entering the second period. ""I've been in this league a long time and an 18-game winning streak is a spectacular demonstration of how good a team is,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""But you're not going to win every game to finish the season. We just felt that if we came out and really concentrated on ourselves, with a pretty simple game plan, we give ourselves a chance."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic, who sprained his ankle Saturday against Miami, is improving. ""He is responding well to treatment. He's off crutches and out of a boot,"" Carlisle said. ""He's progressing well. He will not play on Wednesday. If there's any update, it will be Wednesday night."" The 20-year-old Doncic, third in the NBA in scoring at 29.3 points per game, did not travel with the team to Milwaukee.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Chris Paul had a simple message for the Oklahoma City Thunder amid a 19-point halftime deficit. ""We always got a chance,"" he said. He made sure of that Monday night. Paul hit five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and the Thunder overcame a 26-point second-quarter deficit to beat the Chicago Bulls 109-106. Paul took over in the fourth, going 5 for 5 from deep and scoring 19 of his 30 points. His fourth 3-pointer of the quarter put Oklahoma City ahead 101-100, its first lead since the opening seconds. Paul also had nine rebounds and 10 assists. The Bulls tied it at 106 before Steven Adams put the Thunder ahead with a free throw and Paul added two more in the final five seconds.

Zach LaVine scored 17 points, Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 and Ryan Arcidiacono added 10 while the Bulls shot 58% in the half. LaVine finished with 39 points. ""They were so aggressive and a lot of our turnovers were turning into buckets for them,"" Paul said. ""Once we settled down and let the game come to us, I think we got better."" Paul had two points at the break. ""He really did a great job. Not only finding his spots to go score, but certainly making the game easy for everybody else,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I'm really glad that he's around a lot of our younger players. He understands how long the game and he understands the number of possessions. I think guys like him have a mental computer that helps them gather information on what's available."" The Thunder pulled within 19 at halftime, with Danilo Gallinari keeping them close with 17 first-half points. Oklahoma City whittled it down to eight after three quarters and an 8-0 run in the final minute of the period. Gallinari finished with 22 points and Dennis Schroder had 18 off the bench for the Thunder. ""Chris Paul made some big-time plays,"" Bulls guard Kris Dunn said. ""That's him being a vet. You've got to take the positives out of there. The biggest thing we've got to harp on is finishing games.""

"PHOENIX --  Damian Lillard wasn't concerned when officials went to video review over his potential tying layup with 26 seconds left. Either he'd be called for a charge, or the Suns' Aron Baynes would be called for a block. ""I knew it was a block,"" Lillard said. ""He was moving underneath."" Sure enough, Baynes was called for the foul and the layup counted. Lillard converted the ensuing free throw for a three-point play, the Blazers put together a final defensive stand and Portland escaped with a 111-110 win over the Suns on Monday night. CJ McCollum led the Blazers with 30 points on 11-of-20 shooting from the field while Lillard added 27 points. Portland led for most of the fourth quarter, but Phoenix pulled ahead 110-108 with 32 seconds left when Kelly Oubre Jr. converted a four-point play. He took an inbound pass from Ricky Rubio and nailed a turnaround 3-pointer while being fouled, then hit the free throw. On the next possession, Lillard drove straight through the lane and made a layup while crashing into Baynes, who was trying to slide into position for the charge. Lillard made the free throw and Phoenix couldn't score on its final possession as Rubio's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim with two seconds left. ""There's a lot of opinions in there, but if I would have made the shot, we would've won the game,"" Rubio said. ""It was almost a buzzer beater. We'll take that every day."" Portland has won 11 straight against the Suns. The Blazers trailed 49-33 midway through the second quarter but methodically worked their way back into the game. Phoenix scored just 43 points in the second half on 34% shooting. ""We held them to 21 points in the third quarter and that was huge for us,"" McCollum said. ""It gave us a chance to come back. Fourth quarter we got stops."" Oubre led Phoenix with 24 points. Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky III both added 17 for the Suns, who played a second straight game without star guard Devin Booker because of his right forearm injury. ""It was an exciting game,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""I think both teams at the end could have ended up with a win and we were fortunate at the end that we made one extra play."" Portland pulled ahead for the first time midway through the third when McCollum's 3-pointer made it 82-80. The Blazers took a 90-88 advantage into the fourth quarter. Carmelo Anthony, who scored 23 points, hit a 3 to put the Blazers ahead 100-97 with seven minutes left. The 35-year-old also made a turnaround jumper over Oubre with less than three minutes remaining that pushed Portland's advantage to six. Hassan Whiteside added 10 points and 14 rebounds for the Blazers. Phoenix lost for the fourth time in five games and has a quick turnaround against the Clippers on Tuesday. ""If you're going to play in high-level games, you've got to learn how to manage nights like this,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. The Suns grabbed an early 11-3 lead and stayed ahead for the entire first half, taking a 67-59 advantage into the break. Oubre and Saric both scored 13 points for Phoenix, while Kaminsky added 12. McCollum led the Blazers with 18. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: G Mario Hezonja (back spasms) didn't play in the second half. ... The Blazers improved to 11-16.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Malik Monk noticed teammates Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier were struggling from the field, so he figured it was time to do something about it. ""I seen that a little bit when I looked at the (stat) sheet,"" Monk sad. ""We were just off, and there wasn't anybody else scoring. So somebody had to step up and I was able to do that."" Monk scored 14 of his season-high 23 points in the fourth quarter on 5-of-5 shooting, and the Charlotte Hornets spoiled De'Aaron Fox's return from injury with a 110-102 win over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. Cody Zeller had 17 points and nine rebounds, and Bismack Biyombo added 10 points and 12 rebounds as the Hornets (13-17) won for the fourth time in five games. On a night when Graham and Rozier shot a combined 5 of 21 through the first three quarters, the Hornets needed a spark in the fourth and Monk provided it. He scored eight straight points early in the quarter, including a pair of 3s from the same spot just a few feet left of the top of the key. That seemed to ignite Graham, Charlotte's leading scorer this season, who knocked down two more 3s for a 10-point lead with six minutes left as part of a 23-11 run to begin the fourth. Monk had five his career-high 10 rebounds in the fourth quarter, including a putback dunk off a missed 3-pointer by Rozier to seal the game with 42 seconds left. ""I was attacking the rim, wasn't being too passive and just looking to score first,"" Monk said. Hornets coach James Borrego said it was Monk's best game of the season. ""He was fantastic on both ends of the floor,"" Borrego said. ""To have 10 rebounds is just a credit to his engagement on that end of the floor. Rebounding, defending, attacking the rim. I thought he was fantastic tonight. Really proud of his effort tonight. Our bench tonight was great."" Fox returned after missing 17 games with left ankle sprain and led the Kings (12-15) with 19 points. He played 30 minutes despite supposedly being on a minutes restriction. ""It was nice to get De'Aaron Fox back out there,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""I thought he looked good and was moving well, created some good looks and opportunities for us and we will continue to get better and learn from this game."" TIP-INS Kings: Were outrebounded 51-33. Hornets: F Nic Batum (hand) did not play. ... Charlotte scored 52 points in the paint. WILLIAMS BIG RETURN After missing the previous five games with knee issues, veteran Charlotte forward Marvin Williams had 16 points, three rebounds and two blocks in his first game back. His 16 points came on 5-of-8 shooting from the field, including 3 of 5 from beyond the arc. This was his sixth game of the season with at least three 3-pointers. GOING BIG With P.J. Washington recovering from a broken finger, the Hornets started two big men in Zeller and Biyombo. ""It's given us size, its given us rebounding, rim pressure,"" Borrego said. ""We just feel bigger, stronger out there with those two guys. I don't know where we go from here. I thought tonight and last game it gave us at what those two guys can do for us defensively and on the boards. They're both great rebounders and they both play extremely hard."" BAGLEY FEELING BETTER Marvin Bagley III had 14 points and seven rebounds off the bench in 22 minutes for the Kings. ""I feel great,"" Bagley said of slowly working back into form. ""I feel like how I was before I got hurt conditioning-wise. Just have to keep going and keep pushing."" Bagley said it might take the Kings some time to get used to him and Fox being back in the rotation for the team to regain its chemistry. ""Its different because the whole time I was out and De'Aaron was out they had a certain group (on the floor) and we just need to work our way back in,"" Bagley said. ""It changes it up a little bit but I think it's coming along. It's coming along fine. Like I said, we just let this one go. It's nothing to worry about. We just have to fix our mistakes and continue to move forward and try to win.""","401161043"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Malcolm Brogdon saw an opening and took it Tuesday night. And just like that, the Los Angeles Lakers' long winning streak away from home was over. Brogdon drove past Dwight Howard with 36.4 seconds left, scoring the tiebreaking basket on a nifty reverse layup to help the Indiana Pacers protect their home court with a 105-102 victory over the NBA's best road team. ""We knew when we threw a punch, they would punch back,"" Domantas Sabonis said. ""We just stuck together."" Eventually, the Pacers threw enough scoring jabs to earn their fourth straight victory -- perhaps their most impressive all season. The Lakers (24-4) came into the game with the league's best record and 14 straight wins on the road, the second-longest streak in franchise history and two wins short of their record-setting mark from 1971-72. But even LeBron James couldn't bail them out with All-Star forward Anthony Davis missing the game because of a sprained right ankle. Yes, James scored 20 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, but he missed a step-back 3-pointer with 11.7 seconds left that would have given the Lakers the lead. A replay review overturned a call and gave the Pacers the ball. Sabonis then made one of two free throws to finish with 26 points and 10 rebounds. Rajon Rondo and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope each missed a shot before time expired as the Lakers desperately tried to force overtime. ""Throughout the winning streak, we were able to keep our composure, whether we were up or down, still being able to make a game of it, which we did tonight,"" James said. ""But sometimes the ball doesn't bounce your way."" That was certainly true Tuesday. After leading most of the first half, the Lakers trailed most of the second half until a 9-0 spurt midway through the fourth quarter turned a five-point deficit into a 95-91 lead. It didn't last long. Brogdon's mid-range jumper with 2:20 left tied the score at 100. Myles Turner broke the tie by making two free throws with 1:59 left. Nineteen seconds later, James' free throws tied it up again and that's how it stayed until Brogdon took matters into his own hands and charged right past Howard and deftly used the rim to protect the ball for the basket. ""We trust him with the ball in his hands and he's been making tough shots for us,"" Sabonis said. ""He's been big for us all year."" TIP-INS Lakers: James scored only seven points in the second half -- all in the fourth quarter -- and had five turnovers. ... Howard had a season-high 20 points. ... Avery Bradley had 13 points, Alex Caruso had 11 while JaVale McGee and Caldwell-Pope each scored 10. ... Rondo had seven points and seven assists. ... The Lakers were 8 of 31 on 3-pointers. Pacers: Jeremy Lamb left in the second half with a sore right groin. ... Sabonis posted his 23rd double-double this season and had four assists ... Turner finished with 16 points and seven rebounds, while Brogdon had 14 points and six assists. ... T.J. Warren had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocks as Aaron Holiday and T.J. McConnell combined for 21 points off the bench. ... Indiana was 13 of 20 from the free throw line. SPEAKING FRANK-LY As Pacers coach Nate McMillan scouted the Lakers game tape, he saw some familiar plays and heard some familiar language. That shouldn't come as a surprise given his experience working alongside Lakers coach Frank Vogel for three seasons with Indiana. ""A lot of times, things travel with us,"" McMillan said. ""So they're doing some of the things he did when he was here, and they're doing some of the things he wanted to do when he was here."" Vogel hired McMillan as associate head coach in 2013. McMillan took over as the Pacers head coach when Vogel was let go after the 2016-17 season. THEY SAID IT Lakers: ""We wanted to get LeBron coming off a pin down from Dwight and we didn't execute the play very well,"" Rondo said when asked about his 29-footer in the waning seconds. ""I got a look that I wanted, it just went in and out."" Pacers: ""We're a really good team. We've got to come to play every night,"" Brogdon said. ""But we can compete. We can beat anybody.""","401161044"
"NEW YORK --  In a battle between struggling teams, the New York Knicks had arguably their best game of the season and the Atlanta Hawks hit a new low. Rookie RJ Barrett scored a career-high 27 points, and the Knicks ran away from Trae Young and the Hawks for a 143-120 win on Tuesday night. Mitchell Robinson had a career-high 22 points along with 13 rebounds, and Marcus Morris also scored 22 for the Knicks, who have won three of four after a 10-game losing streak. New York improved to 3-3 under interim coach Mike Miller, who took over after David Fizdale was fired eight games into the skid and has the team believing it can turn its season around. ""We're trending in the right direction,"" Morris said. ""I'm not going to go out and say we're going to make the playoffs, but ... that's what we're fighting towards. That's the goal. We're definitely trying hard. Hopefully, we do make it. If we continue to play like this and pull together, we have a great shot to do it."" Robinson said the coaching change was a catalyst for the team. ""We were pretty much tired of the way the season was going,"" he said. ""We just decided we needed to make some changes. We did that energy-wise and we came out and we compete our (butts) off."" Young scored 42 points for the Hawks, who lost their fifth straight. De'Andre Hunter added 19 points. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce delayed his postgame meeting with reporters to talk to his team. ""As expected, a very frustrated room,"" Pierce said. ""It's tough when you come off of an effort you have on Sunday against the Lakers and you come here. We couldn't hit first, we played on our heels, we let a lot of things impact our effort. That's the biggest thing I keep talking about. Competitive spirit, trying to find that effort. We don't have it right now."" New York went ahead by 31 points on Barrett's three-point play early in the third quarter and never looked back. Young did his best to keep Atlanta in the game with 22 points in the first half, but New York held the Hawks to 42% shooting in building a 77-53 lead at the break. The Knicks went on a 26-5 run starting in the first quarter and continuing into the second. TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce said he believes Young and John Collins are the best pick-and-roll duo in the league. ... Collins (suspension) missed his 23rd straight game and is eligible to return on Dec. 23.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Spencer Dinwiddie and the Brooklyn Nets didn't sound bothered that a team that hasn't won in almost a month took them to overtime. They were more gratified to know their defense could bail them out on nights when shots aren't falling. Dinwiddie scored 31 points and the Brooklyn Nets beat New Orleans 108-101 in overtime on Tuesday night, extending the Pelicans' franchise-long losing streak to 13 games. ""I know I sound like a broken record, but it's the same old thing,"" Dinwiddie said. ""If we can hold a team to 100, then we have a chance to win. ""Tonight, we were pretty bad offensively,"" he added. Joe Harris scored 24 points as he and Dinwiddie scored more than half of the Nets' points on a night when they shot 41.7% (40 of 96) and missed 28 of 39 3s. ""The shots will definitely come. We've just got to continue to be aggressive,"" Harris said. ""Sometimes you're going to have a couple of games -- a stretch -- where you might be off, but what's important is that the defense has been constant throughout. That's something that's really encouraging, that when you can play that solid defensively and give yourself a chance to win."" Harris curled to the right wing on a play drawn up out of a timeout, received the inbound pass and immediately pulled up for his fifth 3 of the game to put Brooklyn ahead 104-98 with 1:28 to go in the extra period. Brandon Ingram quickly responded with a 3, but the Pelicans, who missed 71 of 108 shots on the night, got no closer. ""The guys, they are still competing and playing hard,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""This was probably our best defensive game against a team that's really a good offensive team. ... I didn't think we got discouraged. I though we played. I thought we battled. We just came up short."" Ingram had 22 points and 10 rebounds but missed 10 of his first 11 shots before scoring all but two of his points after halftime. Jrue Holiday scored 21 points for the Pelicans, who kept the game competitive despite shooting 34.3% and missing 29 of 40 from 3-point range. Jarrett Allen had 12 points, 14 rebounds and tied a career-high with six blocks for the Nets, who've won five of seven. ""It was an ugly game,"" said Allen, whose transition dunk to tie the game at 93 in the final minute of regulation. ""I don't know how we pulled it out."" No team led by more than eight points in a game with 14 lead changes and 13 ties. Brooklyn looked primed to take control when Taurean Prince scored his first points of the game on a transition 3 with 2:53 left in regulation for an 89-83 Nets lead. But the Pelicans quickly responded with Holiday's layup and Lonzo Ball's 3, then took a 93-91 lead when Holiday was fouled while attempting a two-handed dunk that rolled in off the front rim. Holiday and Dinwiddie both missed 3s in the final half-minute or regulation. ""They're going to break their streak. We're just happy it wasn't against us,"" said Nets guard and former LSU star Garrett Temple. ""For us to be in OT after shooting the way we did against a desperate team like that on the road, we felt good that we were going to be able to close them out."" TIP-INS Nets: Dinwiddie has scored 24 or more points in five of his last six games. ... Reserve David Nwaba had 12 points, going 2 of 3 from 3-point range. ... The Nets shot 41.7% (40 of 96) and missed 28 of 39 3s. Pelicans: Executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin said rookie Zion Williamson's surgically repaired right knee is now ""fully weight-bearing,"" allowing him to begin some on-court basketball activities including shooting. ""We are a little ways away yet, but today was a really big first step,"" Griffin said. Williamson is now beyond the initial six- to-eight-week timeframe for his rehab from a scope of his meniscus. Griffin did not provide a new target date for his return. ... J.J. Redick did not play because of his sore left groin. ... The Pelicans had 17 offensive rebounds and outrebounded Brooklyn 59-55, but had only 13 second-chance points. DRY SPELL The Pelicans led by as many as eight points in the first half when Josh Hart made three 3s in less than two minutes to make put New Orleans up 35-27 with 7:30 left in the second quarter. The Pelicans then went scoreless for the rest of the half, missing 16 straight shots and turning it over three times, twice on shot-clock violations. The Nets took advantage with a 15-0 run during which Dinwiddie scored eight points and took a 42-35 lead into halftime. New Orleans' scoring drought ended just short of nine minutes on Ball's pull-up jumper. ""We defended amazingly,"" Temple said. ""Any stretch like that has an effect on the game.""","401161046"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchells dunk changed everything. With the Jazz trailing by seven in the fourth quarter, Mitchell drove down the lane and rose up to jam the ball in traffic over Nikola Vucevic. The highlight-reel play awoke a moribund offense and energized the crowd, sparking a late spurt that sent Utah past the Orlando Magic 109-102 on Tuesday night. On a play like that you cant lay it up, youve got to go up there and try and dunk it, Mitchell said. I really dont know how it happened. I didnt dunk in warmups. I just didnt have any legs. But he found plenty of energy when Utah needed him most. Mitchell finished with 30 points, including eight as the Jazz (16-11) closed the game on a 19-5 run for their third victory in a row. The guys kept their focus. There was no hanging their heads, coach Quin Snyder said. We didnt let those mistakes pull us apart, but they brought us together and thats what the game at the end reflected. Bojan Bogdanovic scored nine of his 30 points during the decisive surge, and Joe Ingles had 16 points and a season-high 12 rebounds. Bogdanovic and Mitchells two-man game was unstoppable down the stretch as they became the first Jazz duo to score 30 points each in a game since Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer did it in 2008. When it gets to six minutes and under, Bogey doesnt miss. To have that type of confidence  it makes our team so much better and we missed that at times last year, Mitchell said. Bogdanovic feels the same way. Theres a great, great connection between us ... especially at the end of games, he said. D.J. Augustin had 22 points off the bench, including 14 in the fourth quarter, and Evan Fournier added 19 for the Magic, who fell to 12-15. The game was there for us to take it. We just didn't make plays in the last three minutes. It (stinks) because we fought our way back,"" Vucevic said. After a 3-pointer by Ingles and a free throw by Ed Davis, the Jazz led 82-65. But the Magic mounted a quick comeback against Utahs struggling bench players. Fourniers basket capped a 12-0 run to get the Magic to 82-77 early in the final quarter. Orlando then overcame an eight-point deficit to lead 97-90 after a 15-0 spurt powered by Augustins seven points. A game after hitting a season-high 17 3-pointers, the Magic missed their first 10 attempts from beyond the arc and ended up 7 for 35 from 3-point range as they seemed reticent to challenge Rudy Gobert inside. Obviously, it opens up a lot of things when you can make 3s -- especially with a guy like Rudy inside. You want to split him off. But if you keep missing, he's going to stay in there,"" Fournier said. Gobert had a double-double by halftime with 10 points and 12 rebounds as the Jazz built a 58-47 lead at the break. We fought hard, so I just told the guys, Look, if we would have played as hard in the first half, we might have won, Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Mike Conley returned for the Jazz after missing five games with a tight hamstring but left in the third quarter when the pain returned. He had seven points and six assists. Ingles, who has primarily been a reserve this season, began starting when Conley was out and has been scoring and shooting at a much higher clip. The Australian forward stayed in the starting lineup Tuesday. Vucevic, in his second game back after an 11-game absence, had 12 points on 4-for-15 shooting. He grabbed 11 rebounds. YOU GOT TO MOVE IT, MOVE IT One sequence typified the way the Jazz aspire to play. Mitchell drove the lane and passed the ball to Bogdanovic, who moved it to Royce ONeale and around the 3-point line to Ingles, who found Mitchell in the corner for an open 3. If the ball can stay moving like that and the way the teams constructed, it gives a lot of guys opportunity. Thats the way we want to play, Snyder said. The Jazz had 27 assists on their 42 field goals, and four starters had four or more. TIP-INS Magic: Michael Carter-Williams got a taunting technical after stealing the ball from Ingles, and then Clifford got one for arguing the call.  The Magic challenged a loose-ball foul in the fourth quarter, but the call was upheld.  Orlando committed just three turnovers, which set a season low and tied a franchise record. Utah had 14. Jazz: Ingles hit a 3 just before the first-quarter buzzer and stared down Carter-Williams for several seconds with a wry smile.  Career assists and steals leader John Stockton attended the game and received a standing ovation when he was shown on the video board.  Gobert finished with 12 points and 19 rebounds, his 19th consecutive double-double, as Utah outrebounded Orlando 58-41.","401161047"
"Max Kellerman states his reasons for wanting Kawhi Leonard on his team over LeBron James at this point in the season. (1:48) LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Clippers are one player short of finally fielding their entire team. And it can't come too soon for Paul George and Kawhi Leonard. George scored 24 points, Leonard added 20 and the Clippers returned home after two weeks away to beat the Phoenix Suns 120-99 on Tuesday night.

We can see what our rotation is."" The Clippers went 4-2 on their recent road trip, which matched their longest of the season. Leonard didn't play in the finale, a loss Saturday at Chicago. But he came back strong at Staples Center, teaming with George in a dominant third quarter that saw the Clippers stretch their lead from five points to 21 by the time it was over. The two superstars combined to score 18 points in a 32-16 run that sent the Clippers into the fourth leading 90-69. We just couldn't figure out the Clippers' zone,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. We were a bit tired, playing in three time zones in four days. Our starting group just passed it around and was hoping for something to happen."" Lou Williams added 20 points for the Clippers, scoring their first 11 of the fourth -- including three 3-pointers. When he gets it going there is no shot that he can't make,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. That was a good stretch for us.

As a team, however, the Suns had 30 assists, their 11th straight game with 29 or more, which made them the first team to do so since Charlotte went 13 straight games from March 30 to April 23, 1989.","401161048"
"CLEVELAND --  Terry Rozier was stunned as he set up to take a shot that would have capped a huge comeback for the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier, who almost single-handedly brought the Hornets back from a 24-point deficit, missed a wide-open 3-pointer with three seconds left and the Cleveland Cavaliers hung on for a 100-98 win Wednesday night. ""It was crazy I was so open,"" he said. ""I couldn't believe it. I was so open for the last couple shots. It would have been good to get this one. It stinks that I missed it."" Rozier scored 19 of his career-high 35 points in the fourth quarter, including five 3s, as the Hornets nearly dealt the Cavaliers a crushing defeat after Cleveland led the entire game and was ahead 67-43 early in the third. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, who had his feet in a bucket of ice while sitting at his locker after the game, knew what his reaction would have been if Rozier's shot had gone in. ""I probably would have dumped this ice on my head and then left,"" he said. Collin Sexton scored 23 points and Cedi Osman had 18 for Cleveland, which had lost 16 of 18. Rozier's 3-pointer with 21 seconds remaining cut the deficit to 100-98. Sexton dribbled the ball off his foot and out of bounds with 16 seconds left. Rozier, thanks to a strong screen set by Cody Zeller, popped open at the top of the key, but the shot hit off the rim and Sexton grabbed the rebound to finally secure the victory for the Cavs. Cavaliers coach John Beilein said a defensive breakdown led to Rozier being so open on the last play. ""We missed a switch, so we were not in a position for the next switch,"" Beilein said. ""Rozier was just terrific. There were a couple tough shots, but a couple where we just got lost."" Rozier was 12 of 27 from the field and 7 of 15 on 3s. Zeller had 15 points for the Hornets. Love had 16 points and 14 rebounds for Cleveland. Tristan Thompson added 14 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland's biggest lead came on Darius Garland's 3-pointer, but Charlotte heated up from the field and cut into the margin. Rozier scored seven points, including a 3 at the third-quarter buzzer that trimmed the margin to 76-64. The Hornets continued to slice into their deficit in the fourth. Rozier and Devonte' Graham hit 3s on consecutive possessions, cutting it to 84-74. Charlotte, which defeated Sacramento at home on Tuesday, looked like a team on a back-to-back to start the game. The Cavaliers made 14 of 25 shots in the first quarter and led by 12. Cleveland controlled the first half despite not attempting a free throw. Charlotte committed four fouls before halftime. The Cavaliers finally got to the foul line less than a minute into the third quarter as Osman was fouled while scoring on a fast break, but missed the free throw. Osman had a highlight-reel defensive play when he chased down Marvin Williams and blocked his layup attempt in the third. Sexton made his first eight shots and was 10 of 14 from the field. TIP-INS Hornets: F Nicolas Batum missed his fifth straight game. He's still feeling discomfort in his left hand after breaking a finger in the season opener. ... G Mailk Monk bruised his left hip in the first half and didn't return. Cavaliers: G Kevin Porter Jr. played with protective padding on a sore left shoulder. He took a lob pass from Garland and slammed home a dunk with his right hand in the first quarter. ... Sexton made his 100th career start, joining LeBron James and Kyrie Irving as the only players in franchise history to do so before turning 21. CLEVELAND ROCKS Rozier was born in Youngstown and played high school basketball at Shaker Heights, which is 7 miles from downtown Cleveland. He said he had about 40 family members and friends in attendance. ""It was in my city,"" Rozier said. ""No matter what happens, it's my city. I could play better basketball, but I had a lot of people who are special to me here.""","401161049"
"DETROIT --  The Toronto Raptors beat Detroit but lost two more players in the process. ""A win with a heavy price,"" coach Nick Nurse said. Kyle Lowry had 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for a triple-double and the Raptors had an 11-0 run in the third quarter on their way to a 112-99 victory over the Pistons on Wednesday night. By the time the game ended, however, Toronto was short a few key players after Marc Gasol and Norman Powell left with injuries. The Raptors were without guard Fred VanVleet because of right knee injury. Then Gasol left in the first quarter with a left hamstring strain. With 3:17 left in the fourth, Powell departed holding onto his left shoulder. ""Don't know much,"" Nurse said. ""We've got to check them both tomorrow."" Toronto still had enough firepower to handle the Pistons. Detroit allowed 133 points in a loss to Washington on Monday night. The Pistons got frontcourt standouts Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond back from injuries for this game, but they still allowed 70 points in the first half and 40 in the second quarter. ""You never want to give up that many points, but I liked our start, I liked our effort and I like the competitive edge,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""If we can keep that up, we can build on that, but that's still one of the best teams in our league."" Lowry fed Serge Ibaka for a dunk with 37.4 seconds left for the assist he needed for a triple-double. That was a nice accomplishment, but now the defending champions will have to find out the extent of their latest injuries. ""We avoided the injury bug last year, and that really helped us throughout the whole year,"" Lowry said. ""It's pretty tough for our team, but we've got a bunch of guys that have to step up now, and hopefully it's nothing serious with those two guys."" Lowry already missed time this season with a thumb injury, and Ibaka was sidelined with a sprained ankle. Toronto led 81-76 before its 11-point run in the third. Pascal Siakam and Ibaka had back-to-back dunks that made it 90-76, and a layup by Rondae Hollis-Jefferson pushed the lead to 16. Drummond had 22 points and 18 rebounds for Detroit. TESTY As is often the case so close to the Canadian border, there was a divided crowd of Pistons fans and Raptors supporters. The action on the court was contentious at times as well. There were four technical fouls handed out: Lowry, Siakam and Drummond received theirs in the second quarter, and Griffin got one in the third. DRY SPELL Detroit came into the game shooting 38.5% from beyond the arc, but the Pistons went just 6 of 35 on Wednesday. ""They did a good job of contesting our shots, but so do other teams,"" said Luke Kennard, who was the only Detroit player to make more than one 3-pointer. ""We usually knock some of those down, but we've had other nights like this."" TIP-INS Raptors: Siakam scored 26 points and Ibaka added 25. Siakam was 6 of 11 from 3-point range. Pistons: F/C Christian Wood left the game with a left knee strain. He scored six points. ... Detroit was not called for a foul in the first quarter until Svi Mykhailiuk committed one with 4.5 seconds left.","401161050"
"WASHINGTON --  Chicago Bulls forward Zach LaVine offered blunt advice to teammates as they rallied against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. ""It just seemed like a real ugly game,"" LaVine said. ""I just kept telling them, `Hey, man it's an ugly game, might as well get ugly with them."" It worked. Wendell Carter Jr. made a layup with 9.1 seconds left in overtime, completing the Bulls' comeback from an 18-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Wizards 110-109. LaVine capped a 21-3 Bulls run with three free throws that tied the game at 96 with 5.5 seconds left in the fourth. Bradley Beal hit a jumper with 0.5 seconds remaining to put Washington ahead 98-96, but LaVine was fouled on the ensuing inbound play and hit two free throws to force OT. ""It showed that our identity should be like that for the rest of the year,"" former Wizards player Tomas Satoransky said. ""We won thanks to our defense."" Lauri Markkanen's alley-oop basket gave the Bulls their first lead since the first quarter, 106-105 with 1:47 left in overtime. Beal's two free throws put Washington back on top, and Isaiah Thomas' two foul shots made it 109-106 with 53 seconds left. Carter, aided by a lane violation by Washington, made two free throws with 40 seconds to go and scored the winner after Beal's miss. Beal missed another jumper at the buzzer. ""Felt good,"" Beal said. ""I got an open shot over a small defender. It was just short."" Markkanen had 31 points and nine rebounds, and LaVine added 24 points. Davis Bertans led Washington with 26 points, and Beal finished with 22 on 4-of-19 shooting from the field. The Wizards led 93-75 with 8:21 left in the fourth before Carter's dunk started Chicago's spurt. LaVine's 3-pointer pulled the Bulls within 96-93 with 1:33 remaining. LaVine scored 10 points in the final three minutes of the period. ""Just didn't execute like we did to get us the lead and I think that hurt us."" Thomas said. ""We played like we were stalling, playing against the shot clock and hoping to make the shot at the end of the shot clock."" In his return to Washington, Satoransky had 17 points. Washington led by six at halftime, and Beal and Thomas combined for three 3-pointers in a 9-2 run that gave the Wizards a 74-61 lead midway through the third quarter. STARTING THEM UP Chicago's reserves were outscored by Washington's bench 35-14. ""Trying to find a lineup that would work, that could get some juice going, and we went back with our starters. ... They battled, they made simple plays, they hung in there,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said after his starting five all played 34 minutes or more. WELCOME TO THE SHOW The Wizards signed Anzejs Pasecniks to a two-way contract this week, and the 7-foot-1 center made his NBA debut against the Bulls, finishing with nine points and nine rebounds. Pasecniks, who turns 24 on Friday, had been playing with the Wizards G-League team. ""He was terrific,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""He's big at the basket, pretty good hands. He knows how to play, makes good passes, makes good reads, and he is only going to get better."" TIP-INS Bulls: Satoransky was the subject of a video tribute during the first quarter. ... Carter picked up a flagrant foul in the fourth quarter. He had nine points and nine rebounds. ... The Bulls have seven straight games with at least five blocks. ... Chicago has won three straight versus Washington for the first time since a seven-game streak from April 2, 2010-Jan. 30, 2012. Wizards: Bertans started in place of rookie Rui Hachimura, who injured his groin in Monday's win at Detroit and is out for at least five games. ... The 13-point fourth quarter was their lowest-scoring quarter of the season.","401161051"
"Stephen A. Smith gives high praise to the Heat as he says they have the potential to make it to the Eastern Conference finals. (1:43) PHILADELPHIA --  Perfect home record at stake, a game down to the wire, and the Philadelphia 76ers sure could have used Jimmy Butler in the clutch, just like he was for them so many times last season. The Heat were glad to have the All-Star on their side -- and Butler did enough to help spoil the Sixers' perfect home record. Kendrick Nunn scored 26 points and Bam Adebayo had 23 to help the Miami Heat hand the 76ers their first home loss of the season, 108-104 on Wednesday night. Butler and the Heat won their 20th game, and perhaps proved they're more than a one-man show. ""This is a team of one star?"" Butler asked incredulously. ""Who's our star, Bam? I'll take it. I'll take Bam as our star any day. I ain't worried about what anybody says. We're content with who we are."" The 76ers had been 14-0 at home, including a 113-86 victory over the Heat last month. They came within a late bucket or two of staying flawless in Philly. Tobias Harris buried a 3-pointer for the Sixers with 25.5 seconds left that made it 106-104 and they had sudden life when Nunn missed twice at the free throw line. Al Horford, though, missed an open 3-point attempt from the wing and the Heat escaped in a thriller. Duncan Robinson had 15 for the Heat and hit a pair of 3s in the fourth that stretched the lead to 14 points. Nunn buried a 30-footer for a 99-83 lead that should have been enough of a cushion for Miami. Joel Embiid, who missed Sunday's rout by the Nets with an upper respiratory illness, had 22 points and 19 rebounds. Harris scored 20 points and the Sixers struggled to get going until late against Miami's 2/3 zone that put them on their heels. ""We weren't making shots and when you're not making shots, especially when a team is playing zone, they're going to keep on doing it,"" Embiid said. ""They did it all game and that's how they won the game."" Butler scored 14 points for the Heat and was pretty much a non-factor until late in his second game back in Philadelphia. Butler was soundly booed the first few times he touched the ball and continued to get jeers throughout the game. He played 55 regular-season games for the Sixers last season, averaging 18.2 points after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last November. He helped Philadelphia beat Brooklyn in the first round of the playoffs before the 76ers were eliminated in the second round by Toronto. Butler left Philadelphia in the offseason, signing a $142 million, four-year deal with the Heat in a sign-and-trade that brought Josh Richardson to Philadelphia. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Butler has been a perfect fit for a team trying to return to the playoffs after missing them last season. ""I feel like I've coached a lot of guys like Jimmy that are adults, that are very serious about winning, about the process of winning,"" he said. ""Ultra competitive. He's a max player. We wanted a max player, someone that would fit our culture and our system."" Richardson did his part late, hitting a 3 that made it an eight-point game and one more that made it 101-97 and sent another packed house into a frenzy. With a perfect home start still within reach, the 76ers coughed up the ball to Miami -- and Butler crushed them with an assist on a 3 from Derrick Jones Jr. that gave the Heat needed breathing room. Butler sank two free throws with 33.9 seconds left, toying with the 76ers to the end. ""I don't think we had a sting to our defense,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""What did they have, four 3s with a second left? Sometimes it's just not your night. There were times they were hurling up shots at the end of the clock, one of which was a bank shot, you feel like maybe it's going to be a long night."" TIP-INS Heat: The Heat went on a 27-7 run to close the first half and seemingly put the game away. The Heat stymied with the Sixers with the zone defense that helped them bust the game open. ""It was by any means necessary,"" Spoelstra said. ""We're only playing eight guys. We probably would have gotten into a lot of foul trouble if we just stayed with our man. We still trust it. We'll have to do both, obviously."" 76ers: Butler struck a friendship with Embiid and remained a fan of the All-Star center. ""That dude, he's real,"" Butler said. ""He does everything well. He's a true generational talent."" HE SAID IT ""Gregg Popovich and Pat Riley."" Brown on how to build a generational franchise like San Antonio and Miami.","401161052"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry let out a sigh of relief after being asked the first question in his postgame news conference. Gentry and the Pelicans could finally enjoy discussing a game. Brandon Ingram scored 34 points and New Orleans snapped its 13-game losing streak with a 107-99 win against the short-handed Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. Jrue Holiday had 18 points and Lonzo Ball added 10 points, six rebounds and six assists off the bench for the Pelicans, who were coming off a 108-101 overtime loss at home to Brooklyn a night earlier. ""We were tired, but I thought we just kind of grinded it out,"" Gentry said. ""We talked about playing blue-collar desperate. We had to be the most desperate team, not just in this game tonight, but the most desperate team in the league."" Playing without leading scorer and rebounder Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota lost its seventh straight game after shooting 38% from the field. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 27 points. While the Pelicans traveled, Minnesota was rested. The Wolves last played on Friday, a loss at home to the Los Angeles Clippers, and used the time off to practice three times. ""We had four days off, they're on a back-to-back, but you would think it was the other way around if you watched the game,"" Wiggins said. ""They played harder than us. They got more of the loose balls. They played like they wanted it more."" Minus the injured Towns, Minnesota continued to struggle despite altering its starting lineup. The Wolves led 7-0 early before Ingram started to carry New Orleans. Ingram made seven of his first 10 shots and scored 18 of New Orleans' first 30 points. The Pelicans took control by finishing the second quarter on an 18-8 run, with Ingram scoring seven during the stretch. Minnesota closed within eight in the fourth but got no closer. ""It feels good to get a win,"" Ingram said. ""I don't think we talked about the streak much. I think we just talked about staying together. I think in the last few games, we just didn't close them out, but we played really, really good defensively to be able to win basketball games."" While New Orleans was able to enjoy snapping its skid, the Wolves must deal with theirs being extended. ""When you lose games, it's heavy, especially in a streak,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""I liked what we did the last couple days in practice. I know we felt good about those things. It didn't translate tonight."" INGRAM'S DEVELOPMENT Ingram continues his rise in his first season with New Orleans. With rookie Zion Williamson missing the entire season so far after knee surgery, Ingram has been the primary offensive option. In three seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Ingram averaged 13.9 points, 2.0 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game. Entering play Wednesday, he led the Pelicans with 24.9 points per game while chipping in 3.6 assists and 7.1 rebounds. The 34 points on Wednesday were six off his career high set in November. ""He really wants to be a great player,"" Gentry said. ""He continues to work on his defense. He continues to work on expanding his game from a 3-point shooting standpoint because he's really dedicated to becoming a great player."" MISSING TOWNS Towns was held out because of a left knee sprain and Saunders called the big man day-to-day with the injury. It's the first game this season Towns has missed due to injury. He sat out two games after being suspended for an altercation with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid. Towns had 39 points and 12 rebounds in the previous game. In the fourth quarter, he went down hard after a missed dunk while being guarded by Montrezl Harrell. TIP-INS Pelicans: The 18 points in the first quarter and 25 in the first half were career highs for Ingram in a quarter and half. ... Holiday made three 3-pointers and became the Pelicans' career leader with 556, surpassing Peja Stojakovic. ... New Orleans held an opponent under 100 points for the first time this season. . E'Twaun Moore played 18 minutes and scored seven points in his first action since Dec. 3. Timberwolves: Robert Covington didn't start for disciplinary reasons after Saunders said Covington arrived late. He came off the bench for the first time this season and scored 15 points. Minnesota was also without starter Jarrett Culver because of flu-like symptoms. Gorgui Dieng started for Towns and had 13 points and eight rebounds. Jeff Teague and Treveon Graham also started in place of Culver and Covington.","401161053"
"Chris Paul treats his Thunder teammates to custom tailored suits, which they all wore before Oklahoma City's win against Memphis. (0:48) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Dennis Schroder scored 31 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 24-point deficit and beat the Memphis Grizzlies 126-122 on Wednesday night. Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each scored 20 points and Chris Paul added 18 for the Thunder, who rallied from 26 points down to beat the Chicago Bulls on Monday. Brandon Clarke scored 27 points, Jonas Valanciunas scored 24 and Ja Morant added 22 for the Grizzlies. The Thunder got off to another shaky start on Wednesday. Memphis shot 54% in the first half and took a 68-59 lead at the break. Valanciunas and Morant each scored 13 points for the Grizzlies while Gallinari scored 11 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City did not score for three minutes to start the third quarter, and Memphis took an 80-59 lead. The Grizzlies' largest lead was 89-65. The Thunder surged at the end of the third quarter. Abdel Nader hit a 3-pointer with nine seconds left, then Schroder stole the inbound pass and Gilgeous-Alexander hit a 16-footer at the buzzer to cut Oklahoma City's deficit to 100-93. Oklahoma City finally took the lead on a pull-up jumper by Schroder with just over eight minutes to play. Paul's short jumper gave the Thunder a 122-120 lead in the final minute. Memphis could have tied the game, but Morant and Clarke missed in close and Schroder made two free throws at the other end for Oklahoma City to push the Thunder lead to four.

"Chiney Ogwumike breaks down the Celtics' improved chemistry this season, saying Kemba Walker is a good complement to Jayson Tatum. (0:59) DALLAS --  The Boston Celtics turned to a new Big Three to earn a key road win. Kemba Walker scored 32 points and combined with teammates Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for 82 as the Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks 109-103 on Wednesday night. Brown had 26 points and Tatum added 24 to help Boston prevail on a night when both teams were missing key players and struggled to shoot 40% from the field. The trio combined for 27 of the Celtics' 33 points in the final quarter when Boston pulled away from a Mavericks team missing star guard Luka Doncic. Boston had injuries of its own, playing without Gordon Hayward (left foot soreness) and Marcus Smart (left eye infection). No other Celtics player scored more than seven points. ""The three guys we were going to play through were very clear tonight,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""Those guys all had good scoring nights, thankfully."" Doncic sat out his second straight game with a right ankle sprain, and his absence was felt more than in Dallas' win Monday over Milwaukee. The Mavs scored a season-low 18 points in the third quarter and finished 15 points below their season average despite hitting a flurry of 3-pointers in the final minutes. Kristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 23 points and 13 rebounds but fouled out in the last minute. Seth Curry added 20 points. Jalen Brunson started at point guard in place of Doncic and tied his career high with 11 assists, but struggled with 4-for-13 shooting and had two crucial turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""Most importantly, I've got to stop turning the ball over so late in the game,"" Brunson said. ""Two straight home games turning the ball over late -- that's on me."" After falling behind early in each of the first three quarters before rallying, Boston jumped out front in the fourth with Brown hitting a 20-footer and Tatum a 3 to build an 83-78 lead. Tatum converted a three-point play with 6:38 to go to give the Celtics an 88-80 edge. After two Dallas free throws, Walker hit a 3 and then made four free throws in a row to extend the lead to double digits. ""Our development together is getting better,"" Walker said. ""Chemistry's getting better each and every day."" Dallas hit five 3s in the final 3:34 to trim the deficit. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said Hayward had soreness in his foot since before the broken hand that cost him 13 games. Hayward didn't feel better at practice this week despite a cortisone shot last Friday, and he will undergo an MRI on Thursday. . Smart missed his fourth game in a row. Mavericks: Coach Rick Carlisle said Doncic was improving and would join the team on its two-game road trip to Philadephia and Toronto, but said it was ""highly unlikely"" he would play in either game. HOME WOES Dallas is 18-9 but only 8-7 at home and has lost four of its last six at American Airlines Center, despite announcing its 800th consecutive sellout, including playoffs. ""Sometimes we start a little bit slow and we have to fight our way back,"" Porzingis said. ""Tonight we didn't come out with the same aggression or the same intensity that we did in Milwaukee."" START STRONG, FINISH STRONG Walker did nearly all his damage in the first and fourth quarters, with 16 and 13 points, respectively. In between, Dallas largely used top defender Dorian Finney-Smith to check Walker, which opened up opportunities for Tatum and Brown. ""Those guys just make it easy for me,"" Walker said. ""Whenever I'm missing, they always come up to me and keep me confident. That's especially important for me, being the new guy.""","401161055"
"DENVER --  Jamal Murray knew Denver was scoring at a nice clip and getting some timely stops in the third quarter. To the tune of a 24-0 run? Now that caught him by surprise. ""I mean,"" Murray said, ""I didn't even realize it."" Paul Millsap started the pivotal stretch and Murray helped keep it going as the Nuggets rallied for a 113-104 win over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. For more than six minutes, the Nuggets kept scoring and scoring on one end and making stop after stop on the other. Sure, the scores were nice, but the stops were what immensely pleased Nuggets coach Michael Malone. ""No doubt in my mind the defense was able to fuel the offense and the guys got into a rhythm,"" Malone said. ""We never gave up."" Murray finished with 33 points, including 13 in that third quarter. Millsap scored 14 of his 15 points during the third in his return from a strained quadriceps. Even more, Millsap rattled off Denver's first 12 points of the second half and launched the game-altering run. Trailing 69-50 with 9:18 left in the third, the Nuggets stormed back. By the time the pivotal quarter was over, Denver had an 84-76 lead and was on its way to an eighth straight win over the Magic. After the game, Malone's message to Millsap was simple -- welcome back. ""Guys just want to win,"" said Millsap, who also had 12 rebounds as he returned after missing two games. ""We weren't really ourselves in the first half. It was sloppy. ... Second half, we know what our staple is and that's on the defensive end. We got some stops and got out and ran."" Nikola Jokic added 18 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds. After the decisive run by Denver, the Magic regained their composure and sliced it to 98-96 with 4:30 remaining. But Murray hit a fade-away and a 3-pointer to extend the lead. ""We did a good job of handling their runs, especially in the fourth,"" Murray said. For a half, the Magic looked like the more energetic team despite a seven-point loss in Utah on Tuesday. They ran out of steam after halftime. Orlando went 5 of 23 from the floor in the third quarter. The Magic also lost their cool in the quarter, too, with coach Steve Clifford and guard D.J. Augustin each drawing technical fouls. ""We couldn't make shots and we got good looks. We let it affect our defense,"" said Nikola Vucevic, who scored 20 points. ""We let our heads drop and it cost us."" Orlando erupted for 60 points in the opening half against the defensive-minded Nuggets, who entered allowing a league-low 101.7 points per game. There was a comical moment early in the first quarter when Murray tried to tip the ball away from a defender and accidentally knocked it into the Magic hoop. Vucevic happened to be in the vicinity and received credit for the basket. Murray just stared in disbelief for a moment. He knows that could end up on TNT analyst Shaquille O'Neal's ""Shaqtin a Fool"" segment. ""I was just trying to tip it to myself,"" Murray explained. ""I tipped it too hard."" TIP-INS Magic: Fell to 1/3 on the second night of a back-to-back this season. ... F Aaron Gordon picked up a technical late in the fourth. ... Augustin had 18 points. ... F Jonathan Isaac experienced some tightness in his hamstring. He played 17 minutes and had seven points. ""I don't think anything is hurt,"" he said. ""I just wanted to take it easy."" Nuggets: Murray was 9 of 10 from the free throw line. WHAT'S IN A NAME The spelling of their first names may be the same, but the pronunciation remains vastly different between Denver's Nikola (ni-KOLA) and Orlando's Nikola (KNEE-coal-uh). It was quite an entertaining showdown between the two big men. Jokic finished a rebound shy of his 33rd career triple-double. FAN OF FULTZ Count Malone as a big fan of Markelle Fultz. Malone appreciates the guard's ability to make the most of his opportunity in Orlando after being a No. 1 pick by Philadelphia. ""I root for kids like that,"" Malone said. ""What he went through I'm sure wasn't easy for him."" REST BREAK As a coach, Malone is exhausted following a recent stretch that included eight games in 12 days. ""If I'm this tired, imagine how our players are,"" he said. That's why Malone's managing their court time by nixing shootarounds. ""There are a lot of ways to approach load management,"" Malone said.","401161056"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Portland Trail Blazers aren't concerned about style points. A mid-December win was enough -- tight as it felt against the team with the NBA's worst record. Damian Lillard had 31 points and a season-high 13 assists, Hassan Whiteside grabbed 23 rebounds and the Trail Blazers beat the Golden State Warriors 122-112 Wednesday night. CJ McCollum scored 30 points and Carmelo Anthony added 17 for Portland. Whiteside also scored 16 points. ""Tonight was just one of those nights,"" Anthony said. ""It was a physical game, a game that we had to win no matter what. We did that. We need to find a groove, just a rhythm amongst the team and string some wins together."" After starting the season 4-8, Portland is 12-16 and only a half-game back of the Sacramento Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference standings. ""It was an emotional roller coaster ride,"" McCollum said. ""We gave up a ton of offensive rebounds, lots of 3s in transition, but we tightened up in the fourth quarter. We did a better job of getting stops and running out."" McCollum, Anthony and Lillard combined for 78 points a game after combining for 80 in a win at Phoenix. Anthony thinks he's settling into his role as the team's third option. ""I'm just playing off of those guys,"" Anthony said. ""I'm letting them do what they do and I get to take advantage of what's left and the opportunities that's out there. That's all I've been doing."" D'Angelo Russell led Golden State with 26 points and seven assists. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was pleased with his team's effort. ""The effort was great, we did a lot of good things,"" Kerr said. ""I like the way we executed offensively, but we had too many breakdowns defensively."" Lillard set the tone in the first quarter. Going against the team he grew up rooting for, Lillard had 16 points and five assists in the opening quarter to help the Blazers build a 40-29 halftime lead. The Warriors still showed plenty of fight even though they entered Wednesday with the worst record in the NBA. After trailing by 13, the Warriors led 66-65 late in the first half after a 3-pointer by Eric Pascall. Golden State had a 27-11 advantage in second-chance points and went 16 for 38 from the 3-point line. A driving layup by Lillard got Portland a 67-66 lead heading into halftime. TIP-INS Warriors: While they now find themselves with the league's worst record at 5-23, Kerr believes the Warriors' youthful energy is helping an otherwise difficult year. ""This is basically a brand new group and I really love the young energy we have,"" Kerr said. ""These guys have been great in their willingness to learn and their eagerness to learn."" Trail Blazers: If there's one player who has struggled to find his footing with the Blazers after their signing of Anthony, it's Anfernee Simons. Only 20 years old, Simons is Portland's backup point guard but has struggled over the past month with his shot, shooting 36.3% from the field in the 14 games since Anthony joined. Lillard has often been in the gym after hours with Simons, telling him to trust in his work ethic. ""I tell him more than anything, just make sure you keep getting your work in,"" Lillard said. ""Keep getting your time in and you know everything will balance itself out and you'll come around. "" NEXT Warriors: Friday vs. New Orleans Pelicans.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo looked over at LeBron James and Anthony Davis and thought about his past. ""I wasn't supposed to be here,"" the 6-foot-11 Greek Freak said. Hardly looked that way Thursday night. Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 11 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks beat James, Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers 111-104 in a showdown of the NBA's top teams. The reigning MVP had seven assists and a career-best five 3-pointers as Milwaukee improved to 25-4 after ending an 18-game winning streak against Dallas on Monday night. ""I wasn't the No. 1 pick, AD was, LeBron was,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I wasn't supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to go up against these two beasts.

""You tip your hat off to him and we move forward,"" Davis said of Antetokounmpo. The Lakers dropped their second straight game and fell to 24-5 largely because their bench was outscored 34-4 by the Bucks' reserves. George Hill had 21 points off the bench for Milwaukee. The last time two teams that were 20 games over .500 played each other before Jan. 1 was 1980. The Boston Celtics (28-8) played the Suns (32-8) in Phoenix. Boston won 116-97. ""No matter what team we play,"" Hill said, ""we come in with the same mentality to get better that night on both ends of the floor, and it just happened to be the Lakers tonight."" Milwaukee led by six after the first quarter then opened the second with a 20-7 run. Davis and James combined to shoot 6 for 20 in the first half, and the Lakers had 10 turnovers. The Bucks led 65-46 at the break. Los Angeles outscored Milwaukee 68-46 in the second half to close the gap. The Lakers now head home after ending a five-game trip. ""We continue to build chemistry, we continue to build camaraderie,"" James said. ""Pretty much every time anyone does anything, we pretty much do it together on the road. Just kind of have that bunker mentality, that brotherhood when we hit the road."" The Bucks improved to 3-0 against the two teams from Los Angeles, including a dominant 119-91 win over the Clippers at home on Dec. 6. BROTHERLY Antetokounmpo, his older brother and teammate, Thanasis, and their younger brother Kostas, who plays for the Lakers, swapped jerseys and posed for photos together on the court after the game. ""This is unique,"" Giannis Antetokounmpo said. ""You can't take this for granted. Three brothers under the same roof, going through the same game, going through our pregame warmup. We're blessed."" TIP-INS Lakers: Kyle Kuzma remained out with a sore ankle. Coach Frank Vogel said he's hopeful the third-year forward will be able to practice fully Saturday and be available to play Sunday. Bucks: Milwaukee played its third game without guard Eric Bledsoe. The 2018-19 all-defensive first-team performer fractured his right leg against the Memphis Grizzles on Friday.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The last active player from the San Antonio Spurs glory days, Patty Mills remembers when winning wasn't such a struggle. Mills tells his teammates to stay positive, remain patient and keep fighting. On Thursday night, he showed them how to do it. Mills had 27 points and the Spurs overcame a career-high 41 points from Spencer Dinwiddie to beat the Brooklyn Nets 118-105. Weve just got to find ways to win, Mills said. A lot of it comes down to energy and effort. Were working out the kinks of being able to execute a lot more than we have. Were just grinding it, grinding it out and finding ways to win. Mills had 21 points in the second half, shooting 5 for 8 on 3-pointers as the Spurs rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat the Nets for the 17th straight home game. As tough as the defeat was, Brooklyn suffered a greater loss when David Nwaba suffered a season-ending torn right Achilles tendon. Nwaba left a minute into the fourth quarter after dropping to the court following a scramble for the ball near the top of the key. Its tough to focus on the game right now, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. He was playing as well as anybody on our team. Tough blow. Thats where our hearts and minds are right now. Already without Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert, Brooklyn played its 17th straight game without injured point guard Kyrie Irving. Dinwiddie tried to cover by shooting 14 of 29 from the field, eclipsing his career high by two points. LaMarcus Aldridge was playing the lob a lot, Dinwiddie said. You just try to be aggressive because hes trying to take away (Jarrett Allen) and theyre trying to take away shooters. If they went under, I shot a 3. If they went over, I attacked the basket. The strategy helped the Nets build a 14-point lead in the first half. The Spurs closed the third quarter on a 12-0 run and notched their first lead at 83-81 on Mills layup with 3.8 seconds left. San Antonio was 4 for 9 on 3-pointers in the third, including Derrick Whites 3 to tie it at 81. Mills finished 7 for 10 on 3-pointers. Hes everything, Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray said. Ive never seen him with an attitude in the four years Ive been here. Not an attitude, no head down. Hes a real pro. The Nets never trailed in the first half while the Spurs plodded along. San Antonio committed nine turnovers and shot 40% from the field in the first half. Brooklyn opened the game on a 12-2 run, including two emphatic dunks by Allen. The second slam came off an uncontested drive that prompted a timeout by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich 3 minutes into the game. Allen finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds. Aldridge added 20 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio. TIP-INS Nets: Irving did not travel with the team on its two-game road trip as he battles a right shoulder impingement. Atkinson said there is no update on Irvings injury status. Brooklyn is 11-6 in Irvings absence. Spurs: Former Nets F DeMarre Carroll did not play for the 16th time due to a coachs decision. Carroll is averaging 2.5 points and 10.9 minutes in 11 games since signing with San Antonio as a free agent. FUTURE HALL OF FAMERS San Antonio assistants Tim Duncan and Becky Hammon were both nominated for enshrinement into The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Popovich said he expects both to enter the Hall, but Duncans admission comes with a caveat. Popovich joked that his vote would depend on if the Spurs can turn things around with Duncan as an assistant.","401161060"
"Russell Westbrook reacts to getting a technical foul for waving off Patrick Beverley, who was ejected from the game. (0:28) LOS ANGELES --  Russell Westbrook has had his share of big games at Staples Center in front of family and friends. The Houston Rockets All-Star guard had one of the best outings of his career Thursday night. The Lawndale native and former UCLA standout scored 40 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the Rockets rallied for a 122-117 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. ""It's fun to come in here and get a big win, but the win is the main thing,"" Westbrook said. It is the most points Westbrook has scored in 45 NBA games at Staples and his 12th with 30 or more. It is also the 44th 40-point game of his 11-year career, which ties him with Karl Malone for 22nd on the career list. ""When you give so much attention to (James) Harden you forget the other MVP that is on their team,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""You have to respect him and play him the right way. We lost our discipline a lot on him tonight, especially in transition. Once he gets in front of you, you're not going to catch him, and that happened a lot during the second half."" Westbrook is the first Rocket other than Harden to have a 40-point game since Kevin Martin scored 45 against Portland on Jan. 5, 2011. He is also the first Houston player besides Harden to have consecutive games with 30 or more points since Jeremy Lin in 2013. Houston rallied from a large deficit for the second straight game. It was down 16 three minutes into the third quarter before coming back to take the lead at the end of the quarter. The Rockets trailed by 25 on Monday night against San Antonio before winning by two, marking the largest comeback in franchise history. The Rockets -- who have won two of three against the Clippers this season -- are 7-6 when trailing by double digits this season. Westbrook scored 14 points during a wild fourth quarter that saw both teams lead by at least six. The Rockets led by three at the start of the quarter before extending it to 101-89. Los Angeles went on a spurt of its own to lead 113-107 with 4:29 left. The Rockets closed on a 15-4 run to snap the Clippers' 10-game home winning streak. Harden scored nine of his 28 points during the final six minutes, including a 3-pointer with 2:57 remaining to put the Rockets up for good at 116-113. ""We kept plugging and the difference in the final 3 minutes was that James hit a few daggers and took his game to a higher level,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""(PJ Tucker's) defense on (Kawhi) Leonard was unbelievable and Russ was really good out there all night."" Paul George led the Clippers with 34 points and Leonard added 25. Los Angeles shot 56.7% from the field during the first half (27 of 48) but made just 41% (16 of 39) over the final 24 minutes. Clippers guard Patrick Beverley had yet another tense night against Westbrook and was ejected with 2:52 remaining after receiving his second technical. Westbrook was also given a technical for taunting Beverley as he left the floor. ""We had a chance to knock them out and we didn't,"" Rivers said. ""In the fourth quarter our problem was more of our composure. I just thought we lost it as a team. It happens. It shouldn't, but this is a good learning lesson for us."" The Clippers led by 15 at halftime and extended their lead to 77-61 three minutes into the third quarter before the Rockets went on a 14-2 run. They scored nine of the last 10 points in the period to lead 90-87 going into the fourth. ""We lost that aggression in the third quarter that we started the game with and that was it,"" George said. ""Russ made some big shots when James was struggling and he was ultra aggressive."" MILESTONE George grabbed his 4,000th career rebound during the second quarter. He is one of 10 active players that has at least 12,000 points, 4,000 rebounds, 2,000 assists and 1,000 steals. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden recorded 10 assists and has 4,412 with Houston, passing Calvin Murphy (4,402) for the most in franchise history. Clippers: Lou Williams was ejected with 11:05 remaining in the fourth quarter after receiving two technicals for arguing a foul. It is the second ejection of Williams' 14-year career. ...

"Kevin Love shares his reaction to almost getting posterized by rookie Ja Morant. (1:02) CLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Cavaliers didn't panic when faced with a 12-point deficit early in the fourth quarter. Instead, the Cavaliers rallied to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-107 on Friday night, winning back-to-back games for the second time this season. Jordan Clarkson scored a season-high 33 points, and Kevin Love hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with just over a minute to play. ""We had a deficit, but we were able to fight back,"" said Love, who had another 3-pointer earlier in the quarter. ""We knew we had to get this one on our home floor."" Love's clutch shot gave the Cavaliers a 109-107 lead with 1:03 left. Collin Sexton made three free throws and rookie Darius Garland added two to put the game away. Clarkson hit 12 of 17 shots, including 6 of 8 3-pointers. Love had 21 points, including five 3-pointers, and 13 rebounds. There was a point in the fourth quarter where I didn't think we'd be sitting up here with a W,' Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""I love the way we fought back."" Jaren Jackson led Memphis with 24 points while Dillon Brooks scored 16, but the Grizzlies took their second straight tough loss. Memphis failed to hold a 24-point third-quarter lead against Oklahoma City on Wednesday. ""A disappointing loss, given the lead we had,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Credit the Cavs for coming back in the fourth."" Rookie Ja Morant matched a season low with eight points. His basket with 1:23 left put Memphis ahead 107-106, but the Grizzlies didn't score again. The game had 25 lead changes and was tied 16 times. Grayson Allen's four-point play gave Memphis a 93-81 lead with 10:28 to play. He hit a 3-pointer from the corner and was fouled by Kevin Porter Jr. The call on Porter was upgraded to a flagrant foul, but Memphis failed to convert the extra possession and Cleveland quickly rallied. Clarkson scored five points and Tristan Thompson's rebound dunk cut the lead to 103-102. Love made one of two free throws with 3:15 left to tie the game and hit a 3-pointer with 2:50 left to give Cleveland a 106-103 lead. Memphis regained the lead on baskets by Jackson and Morant, who matched a season high with 11 assists. Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 14 rebounds. Morant, taken with the second pick in the draft, failed to reach double figures for only the third time in 23 games. He took blame for the defeat. ""The last minute I made a turnover and I missed a box out,"" he said. ""Put that loss on me. Ill take it. Cleveland also won consecutive games on Nov. 8-10 against Washington and New York. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Allen returned after missing five games because of a sore right ankle. He was hit with a technical for clapping in Porter's face after being fouled by Cleveland's rookie in the third quarter. Allen scored nine points in 11 minutes. ... The franchise is 4-19 on the road against the Cavaliers. Cavaliers: Garland had 14 points while Cedi Osman scored 13. ... Thompson had 10 points and 15 rebounds. He became the second player in franchise to reach 2,000 offensive rebounds in his career. Zydrunas Ilgauskas is first with 2,336. ROOKIE MEETS VET Morant took off in the lane and tried to dunk over Love in the first quarter, but the ball hit off the back of the rim and sailed toward the other end of the court. Morant's leg struck Love in the head and both players went to the floor. The 12-year veteran helped the first-year player to his feet as Cleveland scored on a fast break. Love joked that he might have asked for a medical retirement had Morant finished the play. ""Boy, I was so glad he missed that dunk,"" Love said. ""I looked back, I helped him up. That was my tip of the hat to him. That kid, he's really special and you gotta give credit where credit is due. He's going to continue to get better."" ""He was in the way,"" Morant said with a sly smile. ""You dont get any cool points if you miss it. I probably cocked it back too much because it hit the rim.""","401161062"
"Scottie Pippen is impressed by how the Pacers are playing without Victor Oladipo and sees them as a 2- or 3-seed when he returns. (1:33) INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan discussed the possibility of a trap game Friday night with Sacramento. The host Pacers beat Western Conference leader Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night and play at Eastern Conference leader Milwaukee on Sunday. However, there was no letdown, with T.J. Warren scoring 23 points to help the Pacers beat the Kings 119-105 for their fifth straight victory. ""We just had the same approach as we did against the Lakers,"" Warren said. ""We've just been following the game plan and excecute while we're on the floor, just continue to play hard, listen to the coaches and believe in ourselves."" Despite being ill, Warren sank 10 of 16 shots, 3 of 4 from 3-point range. ""I just wanted to come out and be aggressive,"" Warren said. Myles Turner added 17 points, and Domantas Sabonis and T.J. McConnell each had 15, with Sabonis also grabbing nine rebounds to help the Pacers improve to 20-9. McConnell hit 7 of 8 shots and had eight assists off the bench. Malcolm Brogdon and Doug McDermott had 13 points each, and Aaron Holiday had 11 in Indiana's balanced attack. ""Everyone is unselfish on this team so we know anyone can get going on any given night,"" McDermott said. ""We had a balanced attack out there and it's good to see. We're clicking right not but we have a really tough test against Milwaukee. We can't be complacent."" Richaun Holmes led the Kings with 20 points on 9-of-10 shooting and a team-high nine rebounds. Marvin Bagley III added 17 points, and Justin James had 14. ""I feel like they imposed their will on the game and we didn't respond,"" Holmes said. Buddy Hield, the Kings' leading scorer, was just 3 of 15 shots for seven points. He did contribute eight rebounds and a team-high six assists. The Pacers shot 64% in the first half to take a 68-57 lead. They finished at 52% The Kings made 53% in the first half and 45% overall ""We gave them too many easy looks in the first half and we just wanted to put a stop to that,"" McDermott said. Indiana led by 22 points in the third quarter before settling for a 92-79 lead entering the fourth. The Kings scored the last nine points of the third, with James hitting a long 3-pointer at the quarter buzzer. The Kings narrowed the deficit to 11 points at 91-81 before the Pacers pulled away again. ""In the first half, we didn't establish ourselves defensively and (the Kings) were playing in the paint,"" McMillan said. ""We did a better job in the second half defensively and we had good ball movement all game. I like our effort collectively."" TIP-INS Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic, who averages 14.6 points off the bench, was sidelined by right ankle soreness. Trevor Ariza was not with the team for personal reasons. Pacers: Jeremy Lamb (14 points per game) was out with a sore right groin injury. Aaron Holiday started in his place. DEFENSIVE WOES Sacramento coach Luke Walton saw too many defensive breakdowns. ""You talk about guarding our man and there's three or four possessions early where somebody just drove right past us into the paint,"" Walton said. ""When you do that at this level, you just put so much pressure on the rest of your defense. If you let your man just by you one-on-one, it's tough to get any stops."" BUCKS ON MIND Myles Turner knows the Pacers are headed for another test against Milwaukee. The Bucks won the season's first meeting 102-83 in Indianapolis. ""We know they're a top team and we have to respect them for that,"" Turner said. ""But we have to go with the mindset that we're going to punch first and, hopefully, leave there with a win.""

"BOSTON --  Even with Gordon Hayward out of the lineup and Kemba Walker having a tough shooting night, the Boston Celtics had more than enough offense against the struggling Detroit Pistons. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum each scored 26 points in only three quarters of work, and the Celtics rolled past the Pistons for a 114-93 victory Friday. ""There's a lot of versatility in scoring with those two,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""They can both put it on the ground. They can both get to the rim. They're both aggressive. They were really good tonight."" The short-handed Pistons helped the Celtics by turning the ball over 25 times. Boston also dominated inside, outscoring Detroit 58-34 in the paint and finishing with a 51-36 rebounding advantage. All 12 Boston players in the lineup scored at least two points and all but Walker, who went 0 for 6 from the floor, hit at least a pair of field goals. ""It wasn't Kemba's night, but everybody on our team contributed to winning,"" Stevens said. Walker still had 11 assists and a pair of free throws. The Celtics finished 45 for 86 from the floor while playing without Hayward (sore left foot) and Marcus Smart (left eye infection). Rookie Grant Williams added a career-high 18 points and Enes Kanter pulled down 18 rebounds. Rookie Tacko Fall finally made his home debut for the Celtics when Stevens answered fans' repeated chants of ""We want Tacko!"" midway through the fourth quarter. ""As the game was closing out, I knew I was getting in for sure,"" Fall said. ""Then it was just a matter of going out there and having some fun."" The Celtics had lots of fun, much of it at the expense of the Pistons. Detroit trailed just 28-26 entering the second quarter, but the Celtics started pulling away before halftime and continued throughout the third. The Pistons were missing Blake Griffin (sore left knee), Luke Kennard (bilateral knee soreness) and Christian Wood (left knee bruise). ""Our biggest nemesis was our turnovers. You're not going to beat a junior high team turning the ball over 25 times for 32 points,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""So that's the game right there."" Andre Drummond had 12 points and 11 rebounds for Detroit. Thon Maker added 15 points and seven rebounds, and Derrick Rose finished with 14 points. The Pistons lost for the fourth time in five games. ""We were in it, you know, in the first half,"" Maker said. ""We just have to continue to grow and take care of the ball like Coach always preaches. And we've just got to find a way to stay together and take care of the ball."" TACKO NIGHT As Boston continued to expand the lead in the third quarter, some Celtics fans started chanting ""We want Tacko!"" -- hoping for their first look at the 7-foot-5 center who had played in just one game this season. They got their wish with 4:31 left in the fourth. Fans roared when Fall got up from the bench and removed his warmups, and then replaced Kanter at center. He quickly committed a foul -- although the fans were certain it was a clean block. Fans altered the chant to ""M-V-P!"" when Fall went to the foul line with 52 seconds left and leaped to their feet when he put back an offense rebound with a dunk with 32 seconds to go. Fall finished with five points and two rebounds. PULLING AWAY The Pistons trimmed a 14-point lead down to six late in the second quarter, but Boston quickly regained control. Brown hit back-to-back 3-pointers, then another from beyond the arc while drawing a foul with 1.1 seconds left in the second quarter. Brown hit the free throw to help the Celtics to a 60-48 halftime lead. Boston kept up the pace in the third quarter, outscoring Detroit 31-21 while taking advantage of seven more turnovers by the Pistons. TIP-INS Pistons: Griffin was out for the second time in three games. ... Detroit came close to matching its season high of 29 turnovers from Oct. 28 against Indiana. Celtics: Kanter hadn't pulled down more than 13 rebounds in his first season with Boston. ... Williams' previous scoring high was 10 points against the Knicks on Nov. 1. ...

"TORONTO --  Serge Ibaka stepped into the starting lineup and helped the injury-riddled Raptors keep winning. Kyle Lowry scored 26 points, Ibaka had 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Toronto overcame the absence of three key players to beat the struggling Washington Wizards 122-118 on Friday night. Fred VanVleet returned from a five-game absence with 16 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, and OG Anunoby scored 18 as Toronto won its sixth straight over the Wizards. VanVleet said Ibaka, who started for the first time this season, has more talent than the typical NBA reserve. ""Serge is a starter,"" VanVleet said. ""He took that sacrifice to come off the bench for the betterment of our team, but he's still a starting-caliber big in this league, and a very good one at that."" Ibaka has recorded double-doubles in three of his past four games. ""He's feeling good about himself,"" Lowry said. ""We just need him to play at that level."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks had Ibaka on his roster for six seasons in Oklahoma City, and still has a fondness for the Congolese big man's intense style. ""He's as passionate and competitive and angry on the court as I've seen any player, and I love that about him,"" Brooks said of Ibaka. ""He's hard to guard, he's strong."" The Raptors won their third straight home game despite playing without leading scorer Pascal Siakam (groin), center Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and guard Norman Powell (left shoulder). ""Any win is tough in this league, especially when you're missing half your team,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Siakam and Gasol were the only two players to start each of Toronto's first 27 games. Powell had started 16 of the past 19, including 11 in place of Lowry while the five-time All-Star was recovering from an injured left thumb. VanVleet had missed Toronto's past five games because of a right knee contusion. ""I'd like to think that I increased our chances of winning tonight, regardless of how ugly it was,"" VanVleet said. Bradley Beal scored 37 points, Ish Smith had 26 and Isaiah Thomas scored 12 as the Wizards lost for the eighth time in 10 December games. ""I feel like we should have won,"" Beal said. ""We had enough flow and juice to win. Down the stretch, we kind of got away from ourselves. We weren't defending. They made some tough shots down the stretch, too."" Smith made all nine of his field-goal attempts, including four from 3-point range. He also shot 4 for 4 at the free throw line. ""I expect him not to miss tomorrow night, either,"" Brooks joked. The Wizards visit Philadelphia on Saturday. Beal shot 3 for 10 from 3-point range while teammate Davis Bertans went 2 for 12 from long range. Bertans finished with 10 points. Toronto led 96-85 to begin the final quarter, but Beal and Admiral Schofield made back-to-back 3-pointers to cut the deficit to two points, and Smith's 3-pointer with 5:21 to go tied it at 107-107. McCaw hit a tiebreaking 3 with 3:02 remaining and, after Beal missed a 3 that would have tied the score, Lowry answered with a 3 with 2:00 left, putting the Raptors up 116-110. Beal and Troy Brown Jr. each made baskets in the final 21 seconds to cut the deficit to two points, but VanVleet made four free throws down the stretch to preserve the win.

Miami's starters got the fourth quarter off. Dragic played 24 minutes after being sidelined for nine games. ""You need to get back and try to fit in again with the system,"" Dragic said. ""And I feel like I didn't miss any games."" Duncan Robinson scored 18 for Miami on 6-for-10 shooting from 3-point range. Kendrick Nunn scored 15, Derrick Jones Jr. had 14, Tyler Herro finished with 12 and Kelly Olynyk added 10 for the Heat. Miami led by as many by 34 and posted its sixth wire-to-wire win of the season. The Heat won easily and Jimmy Butler was called upon to take only three shots. Butler finished with nine points and eight assists in 28 minutes -- his third-lightest night of the season, and after a stretch where he averaged nearly 40 minutes in Miami's last nine games. ""Jimmy really facilitates a mindset for guys to grow because he's such a giving and unselfish player,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Bobby Portis came off New York's bench to lead the Knicks with 30 points on 12-for-17 shooting. Mitchell Robinson scored 18 points, Marcus Morris had 15, Julius Randle added 13 and Kevin Knox finished with 11. ""They were getting everything they wanted,"" Portis said. ""They were getting lobs at the rim, open 3s. This wasn't our best game defensively and they exposed us a little bit on the defensive end, but the best part about the NBA is we have a game tomorrow and we can go there and try to correct it."" It was the first meeting between the clubs since the Knicks fired coach David Fizdale and replaced him with interim coach Mike Miller. Fizdale is a former Heat assistant and a close friend of Spoelstra, who still is disappointed about New York's decision. ""They hired him to do a job,"" Spoelstra said. ""It takes time to build culture and build something, which we've done as well. It takes time. It takes a great deal of stability from the people you work for, which I'm so grateful we have here. I just think it stinks."" New York allowed the Heat to shoot 56 percent. ""They put a lot of pressure on our defense,"" Miller said. TIP-INS Knicks: RJ Barrett had only two points on 1-for-10 shooting. ... Reggie Bullock (cervical disk herniation) and former Heat guard Wayne Ellington (sore left Achilles) were ruled out. Allonzo Trier was questionable with concussion-like symptoms but played in the fourth quarter, logging 10 minutes. ...

Heat: Miami had assists on each of its first 20 field goals and finished with 34 assists on 43 baskets. Of the 10 Heat players who appeared, nine had multiple assists. ... Justise Winslow (strained lower back) missed his eighth consecutive game citing that issue and was unavailable for the 19th time in Miami's last 25 games overall. HELPING HAND Knicks assistant coach Kaleb Canales once sought a video internship with the Heat -- so he sent weekly letters to Spoelstra, a former Miami video-room guy himself, looking for help and advice. The Heat brought Canales in for an interview, but ultimately hired current Heat assistant Dan Craig instead. Spoelstra and Canales stayed in touch, and Canales eventually got an NBA job. ""He's relentless and he's been a friend,"" Spoelstra said. ONE-SIDED The Heat led 39-20 after one quarter and 70-47 at the half. Out of the 152 Heat-Knicks games all-time, including playoffs, those margins -- 19 points after one quarter, 23 at the break -- tied for the second-biggest leads Miami ever had over New York at that point in a game.","401161066"

""You never want to be without Luka, and we need him back as soon as possible,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""But as long as he's out, we have a plan and guys are executing well. We really played together and extremely well. If you're going to win in this building, you're going to have to fight and our guys did."" Porzingis put his inside-outside game on display again, reaching at least 20 points and 10 rebounds for the fourth straight contest. He said the Mavericks are deep and gelling. ""The chemistry is good in the locker room and on the floor,"" Porzingis said. ""We got out and do what we're supposed to and play hard. No secret. We have a great bench and that's our strength, just so many weapons."" Joel Embiid had 33 points and 17 rebounds for Philadelphia, which lost its third in a row overall. The 76ers were booed for much of the night while falling to 14-2 at home. The 76ers suffered their first home loss on Wednesday, 108-104 to Miami in a contest in which the Heat stifled Philadelphia with a 2/3 zone. ""The past three games we have laid eggs,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We have not played with a competitive drive that reflects this team."" Philadelphia couldn't solve Dallas' matchup 2/3 zone, either. Dallas held the 76ers to 29.4% shooting from long range; Philadelphia missed 24 of 34 3-pointers. Dallas took control in the second quarter, going up by as many as 17 points. The Mavericks held an 88-77 lead entering the fourth. Trey Burke, normally not in Brown's rotation, came off the bench and pulled Philadelphia within seven points, 94-87, with seven minutes remaining. But the Mavericks kept coming offensively, with a Hardaway 3 initiating an 11-6 spurt that ended with a jumper by Jalen Brunson that put Dallas ahead 108-93 with 3:22 left, leading to more boos and chants for the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles will host the Dallas Cowboys in an important NFC East divisional game across the street on Sunday. Porzingis put an exclamation point on the victory with a driving, one-handed jam with 39.3 seconds left. ZONING OUT Carlisle said the Mavericks went to the zone four minutes into the contest and stayed with what was working. ""We got hot with the zone and we were active in it,"" he said. ""Guys scrambled around and played their butts off. The most important thing is to play hard in it, and that's what we did."" Embiid said the 76ers need to attack the zone with more aggressiveness and take the shots when they are there. ""We were playing scared,"" he said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Brunson, who starred collegiately at nearby Villanova, was booed during introductions. He finished with 11 points and seven assists in 24 minutes. . Dallas also won at Milwaukee on Monday without Doncic, ending the Bucks' 18-game winning streak with a 120-116 victory. 76ers: Longtime Philadelphia news anchor Jim Gardner rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell in the pregame. . Tobias Harris had seven points and Al Horford had nine. ... Ben Simmons had 12 points, eight assists and five turnovers.","401161067"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder proved earlier in the week they can rally for dramatic wins. On Friday night, they showed they can control a game throughout. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 32 points, and the Thunder rolled past the Phoenix Suns 126-108. The Thunder had come back from 26 points down against Chicago to win on Monday and from 24 points down against Memphis to claim a victory Wednesday. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan prefers what he got against the Suns. ""These guys are working hard and they know the last two games against Chicago and Memphis -- that's not sustainable,"" Donovan said. Gilgeous-Alexander helped put the Thunder in a better position by making 13 of his 18 field-goal attempts. ""The shots just went in today, honestly,"" he said. ""I get those shots a lot of nights, and they went in tonight. But that's just a testament to the work I put in every day, and I trust it, and it worked out for me."" Gilgeous-Alexander, a second-year guard, leads the Thunder in scoring. ""It's just a good experience for me,"" he said. ""Not a lot of young guys get to play as much as I do. And the times I do it, I'm blessed and fortunate to be in the position. I'm trying to take full advantage of it."" Dennis Schroder scored 24 points and Danilo Gallinari scored 22 for the Thunder, who shot 56.3% from the field. Oklahoma City has won three straight and eight of 11 to even its record at 14-14. Ricky Rubio scored 24 points for the Suns. Devin Booker returned to Phoenix's starting lineup after missing three games with a right forearm contusion. He finished with 18 points, seven below his average. He made 6 of 11 shots. ""I feel good,"" Booker said. ""I'm excited to be back out there. Obviously not the outcome that I want."" It was Phoenix's fourth straight loss. ""We're in a tough stretch right now,"" Booker said. ""It's my job, it's our job as leaders on this team to dig ourselves out of this hole."" Oklahoma City led 57-50 at halftime behind 15 points from Gilgeous-Alexander. Gallinari hit a 3-pointer, was fouled and made the free throw to put the Thunder ahead 77-69 in the third quarter. Oklahoma City led 101-91 at the end of the period. Oklahoma City closed the game out by outscoring the Suns 25-17 in the fourth quarter. ""That's what we talked about going into this game is that we've really got to try to put a whole game together,"" Donovan said. ""And inside the whole game, you're going to have lapses and moments where you're not playing maybe, pretty basketball. But I felt like the way we were trying to play to an identity standpoint on both ends -- the guys were executing pretty well."" TIP-INS Suns: Coach Monty Williams is a former Thunder assistant. ... Phoenix's starters shot 14 for 23 in the first half while its reserves shot 3 for 12. ... C Aron Baynes was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter. Thunder: C Steven Adams was issued a technical foul in the second quarter for throwing a ball that hit Baynes. ... Oklahoma City shot 50% in the first half. ... Gallinari was called for a technical in the third quarter for voicing disapproval after Baynes wasn't called for a foul following contact. SECOND HALF DOMINANCE In victories over Chicago, Memphis and Phoenix, the Thunder have averaged 65.3 points in the second half while allowing 50. SIXTH MAN Schroder has come in hot off the bench during the win streak. He's averaged 24.3 points in the three games and has made 26 of 50 shots from the field. HE SAID IT Gallinari, joking about Gilgeous-Alexander's big game: ""It's nice to see him play like that. I always tell him that when he plays like this, he just looks like a young Gallo (Gallinari). So he did a great job.""","401161068"
"DENVER --  Jamal Murray has found his scoring touch just in time for the Denver Nuggets to face the best team in the Western Conference. It helps to have one of the best passers in the NBA getting him the ball. Murray scored 28 points, including nine in the final minutes of the third quarter to stem a rally by Minnesota, and Denver completed a sweep of a five-game homestand with a 109-100 win over the Timberwolves on Friday night. Nikola Jokic had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his fifth triple-double of the season and 33rd of his career. He has eight straight double-doubles, including two triple-doubles in that span. Murray struggled to score recently, but has put up 61 points in the last two games, hitting shots that impress his teammates. ""Sometimes he has a wide-open shot and he takes a stupid shot and he makes it,"" Jokic said with a laugh. ""He's a talented player; he can make every shot, especially inside the 3-point line."" The Nuggets' five-game winning streak has come against teams with losing records, but now they will face the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, a team that beat them by nine in Denver on Dec. 3. ""When we played them, we weren't making shots,"" Murray said. ""Now, we are, so hopefully it carries over."" Minnesota, playing without center Karl-Anthony Towns for the second straight game due to a sprained left knee, has lost nine straight. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 19 points and Gorgui Dieng had 18. ""We played hard and competed. That has been common throughout the streak,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""There just haven't been the results."" Dieng was the only Minnesota player to have a positive night behind the arc. He was 4 for 6 from 3-point range while the rest of the team was 6 of 36 from long range. ""We have to have faith to continue to shoot the ball,"" Dieng said. The Nuggets flipped the script from Wednesday when they trailed Orlando by 19 in the third quarter and went on a 32-2 run to take a lead they never relinquished. Denver never trailed Friday, using a fast start to force the Timberwolves to play catch-up. The Nuggets hit 13 of their first 15 shots before missing five straight to end the first quarter. Minnesota got within four points in the second and trailed by just two late in the third, but was never able to take the lead. The Timberwolves had a couple of chances to go up when it was 72-70, but missed two 3-pointers and Murray scored seven points in 1:37 to help the Nuggets pull away. ""I'm looking for my shot more and when I'm open not hesitating,"" Murray said. Denver led by as many as 19 points late in the fourth before Minnesota pulled within single digits. TIP-INS Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell was recalled from Iowa of the G League. It is his third call-up of the season. ... G Jarrett Culver missed Wednesday's game with flu-like symptoms. He had two points and three rebounds in 12 minutes. Nuggets: The 13 home wins are second-most in the Western Conference behind the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Denver has two winning streaks of five or more games this season. ... The Nuggets are 5-0 against Northwest Division opponents. Last year, they finished 12-4 within the division. MOVING ON UP Jokic tied Bob Cousy for 10th all-time in career-triple doubles. He is fifth among active players and at age 24 is the youngest player in the top 10. ""It's nice to be in that company,"" Jokic said. Jokic is nine behind Houston's James Harden and 10 behind eighth-place Fat Lever, who holds Denver's franchise record.","401161069"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard powered the Portland Trail Blazers to another big win. Even a little injury scare for Carmelo Anthony turned out all right. Lillard scored 36 points, CJ McCollum had 31 and the Trail Blazers beat the Orlando Magic 118-103 on Friday night. Portland earned its season-high third straight victory despite losing Anthony to a bruised left knee in the second quarter. The Trail Blazers improved to 8-7 since Anthony joined the team a month ago. ""Everything is good,"" Anthony said. ""It was just a knee-to-knee contusion. I've done it before. I didn't want to take a chance going out there, we were rolling and we set the tone early. I was fortunate enough to look at the score and we were up 20 at one point in time. It happens."" Anthony said he intends to play Saturday night against Minnesota. Hassan Whiteside added 10 points and 17 rebounds for Portland in his 13th straight double-double. ""It feels good for the game to feel like we're supposed to win,"" Lillard said. ""When it gets down the stretch, whether it's a tough game or whatever is happening, it feels like we're going to pull this out. Not like, alright, how is this going to go? It feels like we're rolling. It's not like crazy things are happening for us to win."" Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Portland's backcourt took over in the third quarter. Lillard had 16 points and three assists in the period, helping the Blazers build a 93-75 lead. McCollum scored 10 points in the quarter. D.J. Augustin scored 17 points for Orlando, and Evan Fournier had 16. Aaron Gordon grabbed 11 rebounds in the Magic's sixth loss in seven games. Orlando was hurt by a slow start. Portland put together a 14-0 run and led 31-13 after the first quarter. ""We just tried to pack the paint, force them into tough shots, funnel them into Whiteside and secure the rebound,"" McCollum said. The long scoring drought prompted Vucevic to throw a towel down in frustration after being subbed out. ""Our defense wasn't at the level it needed to be against a team like that with the kind of players they have,"" Vucevic said. ""With two great players like Lillard and (McCollum) we just have to so a better job at that end."" Gordon struggled again, going 4 for 17 from the field while scoring 11 points. He is shooting 40.6% from the field, by far the lowest mark of his six-year career. ""We all go through it at some point. He'll bounce back out of it,"" Vucevic said. ""We all know how good Aaron is and what he brings to the table for us. He keeps competing and keeps playing hard so he's gonna make shots."" The Magic got back into the game with a 14-2 run to start the second quarter. They trailed 57-44 at halftime. Orlando played without Michael Carter-Williams in the second half after he departed with a left shoulder injury. The Magic closed out a 1/3 road trip. TIP-INS Magic: One of the biggest surprises of the NBA season has been the play of Markelle Fultz, who was selected by Philadelphia with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft. Fultz struggled at the start of his career with the 76ers, but he has worked his into the starting lineup for the Magic. ""He has an ability to set a tone on both ends of the floor on every possession,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""And I think that's what the best point guards do. He's in the paint, which was one of our big weaknesses last year. When he's on the floor we're much more inside out and we score off of his penetration."" Fultz had 10 points and four assists in the loss. He also had a rousing dunk in the fourth quarter on Portland's Anthony Tolliver. Trail Blazers: Former Blazers forward Al-Farouq Aminu, who is rehabbing his way back from a torn meniscus, got a loud ovation when he was shown on the big screen during the fourth quarter. Aminu signed with Orlando in free agency. ""He was probably our best post defender,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""He guarded perimeter guys, he guarded centers. He was an exceptional player in his role for us in that, especially defensively but also offensively he developed into a very important 3-point shooter for us.""","401161070"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Slowly but surely Steve Kerr is seeing growth in Golden State. Having DAngelo Russell around to take big shots at key times certainly helps. Russell made a tiebreaking 22-foot jumper with 32.9 seconds remaining, and the struggling Warriors won after blowing a 20-point lead, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 106-102 on Friday night in a matchup of the worst teams in the West. ""That's who he is. Hes built in that way, to close a game, because hes not afraid to miss,"" Kerr said. ""You cant worry about missing. D-Los never worried about that. With Steph (Curry) and Klay (Thompson) out, hes a guy we have to rely on."" Russell finished with 25 points and seven assists as the Warriors (6-24) snapped a five-game losing streak with their second win over the Pelicans (7-23) this season. Damion Lee had 20 points and six rebounds for Golden State. Draymond Green added 10 points and eight assists. Jrue Holiday and Brandon Ingram scored 25 points apiece for New Orleans. Lonzo Ball had 14 points. The Warriors jumped on the Pelicans early on, but New Orleans rallied to take an 81-78 lead on Holidays 39-foot buzzer-beater to end the third. Holiday stayed hot in the fourth quarter and made a 20-foot jumper that put the Pelicans ahead 97-91. Golden State trailed 98-93 before ripping off seven straight points. After Ingram made a pair of free throws, Russell made the go-ahead jumper just inside the arc. Thats our growth, Russell said. I always say young teams find a way to lose at the end of games. Older teams dont do that. Theyre solid the course of the game. Thats where our growth was today. We made that free throw, we made that extra rebound, we got that stop. New Orleans lost two nights after beating Minnesota on the road to end a 13-game losing streak. We didnt establish anything until the second quarter so already we (were) behind the eight ball, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. From the second quarter on we did a good job but obviously D-Lo made some pretty big shots. Thats what hes supposed to do. We have to find a way to win that game. TIP-INS Pelicans: J.J. Redick made four 3-pointers in the third quarter. He finished with 14 points. Warriors: Lee had 10 points in the first quarter. ... Green picked up his sixth technical foul of the season in the third. ... Injured star Curry made a rare appearance and sat on the bench. The two-time MVP drew a rousing ovation when he was shown on the giant video screen.  Eric Paschall left in the second quarter with a right knee injury and was being evaluated after the game. WILLIAMSON ON SLOW ROAD BACK Zion Williamson continues to make steady progress in his rehabilitation from right knee surgery, although New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry is not yet ready to set a timetable for the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. I dont know if theres a one, two, three, four (steps) towards when he gets back out there, Gentry said. We are going to be overly cautious, I know that. Hes making normal progress in a situation like this. Its just not going to be anything that we are going to rush.","401161071"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  With his team trailing by eight points at halftime, Jazz coach Quin Snyder showed his players some clips from the first half when they were missing players in the corners for wide open 3s. Utah fixed those mistakes in the second half and rallied for another victory. Bojan Bogdanovic finished with 26 points, Rudy Gobert had 17 points and 19 rebounds and the Jazz shot 10 of 19 from 3-point range in the second half to beat the Charlotte Hornets 114-107 on Saturday for their fifth straight victory. Donovan Mitchell added 20 points for the Jazz (18-11), and Joe Ingles had 14 points, including two pivotal 3s in the fourth quarter. ""It was about keeping it simple and making the simple read,"" Mitchell said. ""And we ended up doing that in the second half."" Snyder wasn't around to see his strategy fully come to fruition after being ejected midway through the fourth quarter after arguing for a call. ""We have an unselfish team we just have to be aware of what the defense is doing and where the rotations are and how to find people,"" Snyder said. ""I think when we have that awareness we are a team that's willing to move the ball, and that's what happened, the ball the started moving and our guys got open looks."" Bogdanovic finished 7 of 12 from the field and made all eight free throws. ""I have never seen a guy that everyone on the bench, every time he gets it, yelled at him to shoot, and he usually does at the right times particularly,"" Snyder said. ""When the game gets close, he is at his best."" Terry Rozier, who was coming off a career-high 35 points in a 100-98 loss to Cleveland on Wednesday night, had 29 points for the Hornets (13-19). Devonte Graham added 22 points. ""Obviously it's tough to be a team that lives and dies by the 3 when they're hitting,"" Rozier said of the Jazz. ""So you try to stay locked in for 40 minutes, but sometimes you can't do anything about it. All the credit goes to them for knocking down shots."" Added Hornets coach James Borrego: ""They've got multiple ball handlers with size that can pass over our defense. Give them credit, they kicked it, they made shots."" The Hornets played one of their better first halves of basketball, shooting 58% from the field to build a 64-56 lead behind 25 total points from Graham and Rozier. But the Jazz battled back to take the lead for good with 9:15 remaining when Ingles knocked down a 3 after a turnover by the Hornets. Bogdanovic knocked down a 3 to help push the lead to eight points, and Gobert had a dunk with 16 seconds left to help seal the win. TIP INS Jazz: Gobert and the Hornets Nic Batum were teammates on the French national team, most recently competing in the 2019 FIBA World Cup. ... Guard Mike Conley sat out again with a hamstring injury. ... Bogdanovic was so mad at himself after being called for travelling in the third quarter he purposely bounced the ball off his own head in the direction of the official. ... Utah was 19 of 20 from the foul line. Hornets: Batum got a rare start for the Hornets and Cody Martin saw playing time off the bench as Borrego looked to mix things up, as he's been known to do when he feels he needs a spark. SNYDER EJECTED Snyder got ejected for arguing with an official on a play in which two of his players collided while going for a loose ball. Snyder got in the face of Ray Acosta and was immediately tossed. But the Jazz didn't let it bother them and outscored the Hornets 15-11 in the final 6:44 with Snyder in the locker room. ""I thought there was a foul, but those guys have a tough job,"" Snyder said. ""But our staff kept them together and I thought our guys responded as well."" BEST FRIENDS Mitchell said his high school teammate Graham should be the NBA's Most Improved Player. Graham is averaging 19.1 points and 7.5 assists this season for Charlotte after moving into a starting role earlier in the season. ""That's a Devonte that I have known for my whole life,"" Mitchell said. ""He's a kid that steps up and wants the clutch moment and wants everything. And he's going to go get out there and get it. I think he really deserves the Most Improved Player. To do what he's doing, it's really unmatched.""","401161072"
"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie carried the Brooklyn Nets to their largest comeback victory of the season. Before the game, Dinwiddie spoke with NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who he grew up idolizing. According to Dinwiddie, Bryant told him he's ""playing like an All-Star."" Dinwiddie played like one on Saturday night, scoring 39 points as the Nets overcame a 47-point performance by Trae Young and beat the Atlanta Hawks 122-112. Garrett Temple added 25 points, and DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and a season-high 20 rebounds for Brooklyn. Temple praised Jordan for being Brooklyn's most consistent bench player, so far. ""You know what you're going to get out of D, a veteran guy that can really protect the rim, put pressure on the basket on the offensive end and get every rebound that comes off the rim,"" Temple said. ""We need his veteran presence."" Alex Len had 23 points and 14 rebounds for Atlanta, which lost its seventh straight game. ""Frustrating,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I thought our guys gave all that they had to put us in a position to win the game. The offense really let us down tonight -- 39 points in the second half. We go 2 for 24 from 3 in the second half. I think you saw some glimpses of a young team lose their will, lose their confidence in a game where we had the will, we had the pace and control of the game."" With Atlanta trailing 113-110, Kevin Huerter lost the ball and Joe Harris drove for a layup and converted a free throw. Dinwiddie iced the game with a layup to give Brooklyn a 118-110 lead with 1:13 remaining. Atlanta took an 18-point lead, its largest lead of the game, as Young hit a floater in the lane with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter, but couldn't protect it. The Nets went on a 14-0 run to begin the fourth quarter and took a 99-98 lead as the Hawks missed their first nine shots. ""We had, I think, a 13-point lead headed into the fourth quarter,"" Young said. ""We just let one get away from us. They went on a run, and we couldn't stop it. So yeah, we definitely felt like we let one get away."" The Hawks took a 73-60 lead into the locker room at halftime as Young led all scorers with 24 points. Young's pick-and-roll partner, Len, had a double-double in the half with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Dinwiddie scored 20, a career-high for first-half points, to keep Brooklyn within striking distance. ""There wasn't much said at halftime,"" Temple said. ""We knew we weren't playing with any energy in the first half. They were outrebounding us, doing everything better than us.""

"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons swept the season series with Chicago in 2018-19. Now the Bulls are a win away from returning the favor. Chicago can only hope that becomes relevant in a few months, if both teams are competing for a playoff spot. Zach LaVine scored 33 points and Coby White added 19 to help the Bulls outlast the short-handed Pistons 119-107 on Saturday night. Chicago is 3-0 against Detroit this season. The Bulls (12-19) and Pistons (11-19) are 10th and 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, but Chicago trails eighth-place Orlando by only one game. ""We see it, and that's our goal -- get into the eighth place,"" Chicago's Kris Dunn said. ""We've got to go in Monday against Orlando and do what we do."" The Pistons were without Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, and the Bulls pulled away late thanks to LaVine's outside shooting. He and White made five 3-pointers apiece. Detroit has lost four straight. ""I thought we competed in the first half, but we ran out of gas in the second half,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We were trying to get guys in and out and give them a blow, but it is a 48-minute game."" The Pistons led 59-53 at halftime but allowed 40 points in the third quarter. Chicago led 93-83 late in the period, but Markieff Morris made two 3-pointers in the last 10 seconds to cut the margin to four. LaVine broke a 96-all tie in the fourth with a 3-pointer. Then with the Bulls up by four, Detroit challenged a foul call on Tony Snell with 4:21 left. The call was overturned, but Chicago controlled the ensuing jump ball, and LaVine made another 3 to make it 106-99. Andre Drummond had 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Pistons. Griffin has been dealing with an illness, and Rose missed the game with left knee soreness. Chicago was 18 of 35 from 3-point range. TURNOVERS AND REBOUNDS The Pistons had 25 turnovers in a 114-93 loss at Boston on Friday night. Then they had to face a Chicago team that entered the game forcing a league-high 18.6 turnovers per game. Detroit had only 16 turnovers to Chicago's 21 on Saturday, but the Bulls made up for that by outrebounding the Pistons 46-29. ""We won the boards, which I think you have to do in this building to have a chance to win,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""I didn't like the turnovers, but when you make 18 3s you have a little margin for error."" QUOTEABLE Dunn on LaVine's offensive efficiency: ""It's almost like setting up the table. You just can't make food and then think you're just going to eat it out of the pot. You've got to put the plates down, you've got to put the forks down, you've got to put the glasses down. That's what he's doing. He's not scoring, scoring, scoring, scoring. That's easy to guard. You're getting your team involved, you still stay aggressive, and when the fourth quarter comes, be you."" TIP-INS Bulls: Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 rebounds, surpassing 600 in his 75th career game. He's the fifth player in team history to reach 600 rebounds in his first 75 games, joining Tom Boerwinkle, Elton Brand, Charles Oakley and Clifford Ray.

"PHILADELPHIA --  The Philadelphia 76ers finally figured out how to beat a zone defense. Joel Embiid had 21 points and 13 rebounds and Josh Richardson added 21 points to lead Philadelphia to a 125-108 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Ben Simmons had 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the 76ers, who snapped a three-game losing streak overall and a two-game skid at home. Philadelphia suffered its first two home losses in its last two times out, Wednesday against Miami and Friday versus Dallas. Both teams used zone defenses that neutralized Philadelphia's offense. But the Wizards, playing without several key players, weren't as effective when they tried to use the zone. Simmons said it was because the 76ers kept the ball in motion. ""I think we did a lot better moving the ball,"" Simmons said. ""That's really the key, we can't hold on too long. I've been playing against it my whole life. It's not new. Everyone has to be on the same page as far as moving the ball."" Brown said before the game that he thought Simmons, the team's star point guard, could be most effective against the zone as a ""committed offensive rebounder."" Simmons had four offensive boards, and Brown was pleased overall with his players' approach to the previously troubling defense. ""I give them a lot of credit for executing plays that would expose zone rotations,"" Brown said. Bradley Beal had 36 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Wizards. Washington has lost three in a row and nine of 11. ""This is a championship team,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said of the 76ers. ""We're not close to that right now. We want to get there."" Both teams were playing the second game of a back-to-back, and Philadelphia had all players available. ""I wish they could have had some load management games,"" Brooks joked. Isaiah Thomas added 20 points, but was ejected with 2:53 remaining for going into the stands. Philadelphia took control with a 19-0 run over a nearly six-minute stretch in the second quarter, pushing a 34-30 advantage to 53-30 with 4:19 left in the half. Beal's corner 3 with 1:40 left in the third got Washington as close as four, 84-80, but the 76ers scored the last four points of the quarter to take an 88-80 lead into the fourth. The 76ers kept Washington at a distance throughout the fourth to improve to 15-2 at home. THOMAS' TAKE Thomas said he confronted a spectator who thrice repeated two expletives while flashing the Wizards guard two middle fingers. According to Thomas, the fan apologized when confronted and said he was upset Thomas made a free throw because a miss would've given fans a milkshake from a local establishment as part of a team promotion. ISH MISS Ish Smith, coming off a perfect performance in Washington's 122-118 loss at Toronto on Friday, went scoreless in 20 minutes. He was 0 for 7 from the field, including 0 for 2 from beyond the arc, and missed both of his free-throw attempts.

"Jay Williams compares Giannis Antetokounmpo to Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant and believes Giannis has separated from the rest of the NBA. (1:22) NEW YORK --  Giannis Antetokounmpo had a triple-double, though his brother had the highlight. And while the NBA MVP wasn't interested in talking about his stats, he certainly was impressed by Thanasis' one basket, a follow slam with his left hand in the fourth quarter. ""That was amazing. That was a crazy dunk. He came out of nowhere,"" Giannis said. And the Greek Freak had a good seat on the bench to celebrate it after another easy win for the NBA's top team. Antetokounmpo had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his third triple-double of the season, and the Milwaukee Bucks followed their big victory over the Lakers by routing the New York Knicks 123-102 on Saturday night. Avoiding any letdown two nights after winning a showdown against Los Angeles for the NBA's best record, the Bucks (26-4) made their first six 3-pointers to open a big early lead that grew to 29 points. ""Luckily we've got a group that is very professional, very motivated,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think they take their work seriously, they take their routine, the process seriously, and I think it reflected coming off a big win and coming out and playing the way we did in the first quarter."" Antetokounmpo had secured his triple-double by midway through the third quarter after playing just 23 minutes. It appeared for a while that he was going to be finished for the night at that point, but he was eventually called on for some fourth-quarter minutes. He took only 10 shots, making eight. ""I don't look into stats,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""All I care about is that we came in here, we got the job done. Got another one tomorrow."" Khris Middleton scored 23 points and Kyle Korver had 17 for the Bucks, who are playing without starters Wesley Matthews and Eric Bledsoe because of right leg injuries. They didn't miss them at all. It wasn't quite as easy as Milwaukee's 132-88 home victory in one of David Fizdale's final games as Knicks coach, but it was plenty good enough to increase the average victory margin for a team that came in leading the league at 12.8 points per game -- a figure that would be the highest in NBA history if it stood until the end of the season. Julius Randle had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Knicks, who lost for the second straight night. They were out it early after missing nine of their first 10 shots, though they did keep fighting hard enough to force the Bucks to bring Antetokounmpo and other starters back off the bench midway through the fourth after Milwaukee led by 25 through three quarters. ""They went 6 for 6 from the 3-point line to start the game, which was our game plan, to make their guys take shots,"" Randle said. ""They did to start the game and then they cooled off. We didn't make shots to start the game, which just hurt us."" Milwaukee put seven players in double figures in its second straight win after Dallas snapped its 18-game winning streak earlier this week. The Bucks bounced back from that by beating the Lakers 111-104. The Bucks led by 47 points in the first matchup against the Knicks and started this game poised to deliver another blowout. Donte DiVincenzo scored the first five points, consecutive 3-pointers by Brook Lopez made it 17-4, and Ersan Ilyasova's second 3-pointer made it 23-6 and forced the Knicks to call their second timeout in less than 4 1/2 minutes. TIP-INS Bucks: With Matthews sitting for the first time this season, the Bucks used their seventh different starting lineup. ... Milwaukee beat New York for the fourth straight time. Knicks: Elfrid Payton replaced Frank Ntilikina as the starting point guard and had six points, 10 assists, five rebounds and four steals. ... Kevin Knox II had 19 points off the bench. LIFE IS GOOD Budenholzer was a candidate for the Knicks coaching job following his successful run in Atlanta. The Knicks hired Fizdale instead, and Budenholzer doesn't wonder about what might have been. ""No, I don't really think that way,"" the 2018-19 Coach of the Year said. ""Life works out the way it's supposed to and just beyond happy with being in Milwaukee. Ton of respect for the Knicks and their organization here, but at the end of the day just very, very happy with Milwaukee and the team, the organization, the city. Just, I'm in a great place and I feel very, very fortunate.""","401161076"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  This time, the Memphis Grizzlies made their fourth quarter lead hold. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 18 points, Jae Crowder added 17 points and 10 rebounds, and the Grizzlies beat the Sacramento Kings 119-115 Saturday night. Memphis lost road games to Oklahoma City and Cleveland earlier this week, squandering fourth quarter leads in both defeats. The Grizzlies were able to hold on despite the Kings slimming the advantage to 118-115 in the closing seconds. Seven Grizzlies reached double figures, including 16 from Dillon Brooks. Grayson Allen and Ja Morant had 13 each as Memphis snapped a two-game losing streak. ""Hopefully we're learning, trying to find out how to close games. That's a big part of the NBA being able to close games,"" Crowder said. ""We withstood some runs and responded. The other two nights, other teams went on runs, and we sort of didn't answer the bell."" Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 25 points. De'Aaron Fox, easing back after missing 17 games with a left ankle sprain, scored 22, and Richaun Holmes had 18 points and 12 rebounds. Sacramento dominated the paint 60-40 against a Memphis team that is among the league leaders in that category. Sacramento's 18 offensive rebounds contributed to a 31-5 advantage in second-chance points. ""We should've won that game,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""I was proud of the guys continuing to fight being down in the fourth quarter."" Barnes' 13 points in the third quarter helped Sacramento put a dent in a Memphis lead that reached 16 in the first half. The Grizzlies built the lead back to double-digits and led by at least eight until the final 49 seconds when Fox scored five straight points. Barnes hit three free throws and Trevor Ariza's 3-pointer with five seconds left pulled the Kings to 118-115. ""Everybody is upset when you lose,"" said Kings guard Buddy Hield, who continued to struggle with his shooting. ""I don't know who is not upset. If you're not upset, you shouldn't be playing on this team."" TIP-INS Kings: G Bogdan Bogdanovic missed his second straight game because of right ankle soreness. ... Fox was back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the past two games following the ankle injury. ... Marvin Bagley III had 11 points and 11 rebounds. ... Hield, who was 3 of 15 from the floor and 1 of 9 from 3-point range in Friday's loss at Indiana, was 3 of 18 overall and 2 of 11 from outside the arc against Memphis. It was only Hield's fourth game this season not reaching double figures, half of those coming the last two games. Grizzlies: C Jonas Valanciunas was out with right foot soreness. Solomon Hill started his second game of the season in Valanciunas' absence. ... Had 15 3-pointers, marking a franchise-best nine straight games where Memphis has made at least 10 3-pointers. ...

NO WORRIES ON BUDDY Hield is 9 of 33 on 3-pointers over the past four games. Despite the misfires, Kings coach Luke Walton said before the game he's not worried about the guard's recent shooting woes. ""Buddy's a great shooter. He's a hard worker,"" Walton said. ""People are going to make and miss shots in this league. ... We're not concerned with Buddy. He'll get it going more nights than not.""","401161077"
"SAN ANTONIO -- The LA Clippers dunked on the San Antonio Spurs more times than any team in 20 years en route to Kawhi Leonard's first victory in San Antonio since his exodus from the franchise. Leonard finished with 26 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and five of the Clippers' 20 dunks as LA dusted the Spurs 134-109 on Saturday night. ""He was as sharp as I've seen him,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""Not only with his scoring, but with his defense and his passing."" The Clippers' 20 total dunks are the most since play-by-play data started tracking the stat before the 1996-97 season. The second highest was 17 dunks by the Lakers in April 1998, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research. Leonard was roundly booed during pregame introductions and each time he touched the ball, just as he was in two previous visits to San Antonio. The reigning Finals MVP gave the sellout crowd plenty to jeer about during an active 27 minutes. Leonard was 11-for-16 from the field with four steals and only two turnovers in setting a hurried pace the Spurs were unable to match. The Clippers had 74 points in the paint, 26 fast-break points and 36 points off 18 turnovers. ""It's embarrassing,"" said Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, who had 24 points. ""It's frustrating, especially when you're out there trying hard, definitely frustrating."" Leonard benefited from the increased pace, slamming in his season-high five dunks. ""I was able to get out in transition, especially get down the paint and able to dunk the ball,"" Leonard said. Leonard demanded a trade after playing just nine games for the Spurs in 2018 due to a right thigh injury. San Antonio relented and traded him the next summer to Toronto, where he led the Raptors to their first NBA championship last season. Spurs fans have remained bitter about his forced departure, making the team's blowout victories over Leonard and the Raptors last season and the Clippers on Nov. 29 that much sweeter. ""Just the way I probably left and how it was portrayed, the narrative that was portrayed in the media,"" Leonard said. ""But, I don't make no sense of it. I know it's a game and it's competitive. When we're not playing or if I'm walking on the street or I see someone from San Antonio, they thank me for everything I did and they respect the way I played when I was here. It's just a part of the game, I feel like."" Leonard turned the tables in his fifth matchup with San Antonio, spending the entire fourth quarter on the bench as Los Angeles stretched its lead to 33. The Clippers went on a 12-2 run for a 52-44 lead with 7 minutes left in the first half as Leonard and Paul George remained on the bench. Leonard returned shortly thereafter, making all three of his attempts in the second quarter to push the Clippers to a 64-52 lead. The Clippers outscored the Spurs 41-21 bridging the second and third quarters. Los Angeles had six players in double figures, including 21 by Montrezl Harrell and 20 by Lou Williams. George finished with 11 points. DeRozan, who had 13 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the first quarter, finished with 24 points to lead San Antonio. Marco Belinelli added 17 points. TIP-INS Clippers: Former Spurs F JaMychal Green missed the game with a bruised tailbone. ... Landry Shamet had three points in 14 minutes in his third game off the bench after 13 starts. Spurs: F Rudy Gay had seven points in 20 minutes after being listed as questionable due to an undisclosed illness. ... C Jakob Poeltl had four blocked shots, raising his season total to 41 in 28 games. ... San Antonio is 73-15 against the Clippers at home. BACK TO BACK Leonard has not played in back-to-back games this season, and Rivers said that won't change when the Clippers visit Oklahoma City on Sunday night despite his limited minutes against the Spurs. ""I haven't even thought about it, but we'll see. I doubt it,"" Rivers said. ""Just too early for me, to be honest. He may bring it up, but I still don't think we'll do it.""","401161078"
"PHOENIX --  The James Harden-Russell Westbrook combo is starting to become everything the Houston Rockets hoped it would be. The two superstar guards bring different speeds to the offense, and the Phoenix Suns couldn't stop either one Saturday. ""Russell is go, go, go, go,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""When it's half-court, maybe it's James' time."" Harden scored 47 points, Westbrook added 30 and the Rockets rolled to a 139-125 victory over the Suns for their 10th victory in the past 13 games. Phoenix pulled to 115-107 with 9:37 left but the Rockets responded with a 21-9 run -- which included four 3-pointers from Harden -- that slowly deflated the Suns' players and crowd. Harden shot 15 of 27 from the field, including 9 of 19 from 3-point range. He leads the NBA with 38.5 points per game and blew past that number with his fourth quarter outburst, hitting his quartet of 3s in a span of about three minutes. The former Arizona State star has already scored 1,124 points this season, most for a player through 29 games since Rick Barry had 1,134 in the 1966-67 season. By the end of the night, he received an ovation from a big chunk of the fans. ""This city has shown me so much love before I even got to the NBA,"" Harden said. ""So I feel like it's my job to go out there and put on a show."" Harden's scoring has been a constant throughout the season, but Westbrook's production has spiked in recent weeks. He's averaging 33.7 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists over his past three games. The two players took turns dominating on Saturday, hitting Phoenix with waves of offense that couldn't be stopped. ""I don't know if 30 (points) is a benchmark or not, but Russell's playing really well, doing a lot of stuff,"" D'Antoni said. ""And you know James has been playing great."" Said Westbrook: ""It's a good balance for our team, for myself. I think it's moving in the right direction."" Westbrook added 10 assists, and Clint Capela had 14 points and 17 rebounds. The Rockets shot 59% from the field. The Suns have lost six straight games and fell to 11-18. Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 26 points, and Devin Booker had 19. Elie Okobo scored 17 in his first start of the season and all five starters scored in double digits for just the third time this season. Booker said he thought the Suns did a good job of competing in the second night of a back-to-back after losing to the Thunder on Friday, but they couldn't figure out a way to stop Harden or Westbrook. ""They're MVP players, they're going to make those shots,"" Booker said. ""It's how you respond and just keep defending and playing the right way."" Harden scored 18 points in the first quarter and had 29 by halftime, shooting 10 of 15 from the field, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range. The Rockets led 70-65 at the break after shooting 61% from the field. TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon (knee) has missed the past 19 games after having knee surgery. He had the surgery on Nov. 13 and was expected to miss about six weeks. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said he wasn't sure if Gordon would return during the team's four-game trip that ends on Christmas Day against Golden State. Suns: C Deandre Ayton missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle. Ayton played in just one game after returning from his 25-game suspension, scoring 18 points against the Clippers in 24 minutes before leaving in the second half after injuring his ankle. ... PG Ricky Rubio missed the game because of an illness. Okobo started in his place. ""You can boo-hoo and whine about it, but it does no good,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said pregame. ""You look around the league, Minnesota is missing players, New Orleans is missing players all year. ... It's happening to everyone. I don't know if anyone's dealt with what we've dealt with, but I like my team, I like the fight and the way they show up every day.""","401161079"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Hassan Whitesides play, good or bad, is critical to the Portland Trail Blazers. The 7-foot center was at his best Saturday night, finishing with 16 points, 22 rebounds and seven blocks as the Trail Blazers beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-106 for their season-high fourth straight victory. Even while he was struggling with injuries earlier this season and became the subject of trade speculation, Whitesides teammates never stopped motivating him to dominate. When you see games like this game, the Golden State game, stuff like that, its almost like its obvious when hes not doing it, said Damian Lillard, who scored 29 points for Portland. Its obvious when hes not bringing it because when he does, its so obvious and its such a big deal for our team. It was a great game. Great game. Whiteside leads the NBA with 73 blocked shots. That was a challenge from my coach -- lead the league in blocks, Whiteside said. I feel like Im the best rim protector in the league, he added. Even last year, through all the naysayers or whatever, you look who protected the rim in field goal percentage, it was still me at the end of the day. So I feel like Im the best rim protector (and) its not even close. Over the last four games, Whiteside has averaged 13 points, 19 rebounds and four blocks. We really need him to rebound defensively or were not going to get the rebound, as weve shown, Portland guard CJ McCollum said. McCollum had 26 points and swingman Kent Bazemore scored a season-high 19 for the Blazers, who played without a banged-up Carmelo Anthony. Andrew Wiggins scored 33 points for the Timberwolves, but Whiteside made things difficult for them inside all night. Its hard to finish over him, Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. Minus injured All-Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns, the Minnesota offense continued to struggle early, particularly from outside as the Wolves missed nine of their first 10 3-point attempts. Gorgui Dieng helped by making three 3-pointers and scoring 15 points. Shabazz Napier had 18 points and four assists, while Jeff Teague scored 18 off the bench. Lillard had 19 points in the first half to push Portland to a 61-52 halftime lead. Minnesota went on a 7-0 run to start the second half, fueled by Portland turnovers. After committing only five turnovers in the first half, the Blazers had five to begin the third quarter. Teagues running 3 cut the Blazers lead to 83-80 at the third-quarter buzzer. Another 3-pointer by Teague tied the game 83-all at the 11:02 mark of the fourth quarter. He scored 12 straight points for Minnesota before being subbed out. Minnesota tied it two more times in the fourth before Portland pulled away. A basket from Lillard and a 3-pointer from McCollum pushed Portland ahead 98-93 with 5:24 left. The Blazers kept the Wolves at arms length for the rest of the game as Minnesota never again got closer than three. Whitesides putback gave Portland a 107-100 lead with 41 seconds left to put the game away. TIP-INS Timberwolves: For the third straight game the Timberwolves were without Towns, their leading scorer. His injury has forced Saunders to tinker with his lineups, such as moving Teague to a sixth-man role off the bench to help power the reserves to 44 points on Friday. It makes a big difference, Saunders said. Obviously, were missing a big piece in Karl and we just ask for daily growth. We just ask these guys to compete. We felt good coming out of the game last night. Saunders said Towns was progressing but didnt offer much more. Trail Blazers: After banging knees against Orlando on Friday, Anthony was ruled out for this one. He left Fridays game in the second quarter and did not return. After working out a little bit Saturday morning, Anthony made the determination not to play. He got treatment this morning just to see how things felt and it just wasnt quite right, coach Terry Stotts said. Anthony is averaging 16 points and six rebounds per game while shooting 41.7% on 3-pointers.","401161080"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors used a huge fourth quarter to pull off the NBAs biggest comeback in a decade. Lowry had 32 points and 10 assists, Chris Boucher scored a career-high 21 points and the Raptors overturned a 30-point deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 110-107 on Sunday. Lowry had one fewer point in the fourth (20) than the Mavericks managed as a team (21). Ive never seen anything like it, coach Nick Nurse said of Lowrys explosive finish. It was the biggest comeback in Raptors history, and the NBAs first 30-point comeback since Sacramento beat Chicago on Dec. 21, 2009, according to Elias. Players from both sides found the outcome tough to comprehend. Im definitely going to go watch the game again, just to see how exciting this game was and how the fans helped us so much, Boucher said. Dallas forward Kristaps Porzingis wasnt interested in a second viewing after making five of 15 shots. Tonight was a weird game, honestly, Porzingis said. I still cant process what happened. Even Lowry wasnt sure he wanted another look at the first three quarters. I probably wont enjoy it till later on, fourth quarter, Lowry joked. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 18 points and Fred VanVleet had 10 as the short-handed Raptors won their fifth straight and improved to 13-3 at home, ending the Mavericks seven-game road winning streak. Porzingis had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Jalen Brunson scored 21 points as Dallas dropped to 2-2 without guard Luka Doncic, who sat for the fourth straight game because of a sprained right ankle. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said his team didnt maintain its aggression after the Raptors started fighting back. When you get hit with that kind of force, youve got to respond with equal or greater force, and we just didnt do it soon enough, Carlisle said. Toronto trailed 83-53 with 2:55 remaining in the third, but used a swarming defense and hot shooting from Lowry to tie the score at 95 with 5 1/2 minutes to go in the fourth. They were just taking it to us, Dallas guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said. Before you knew it, they cut the lead to 10 and then cut the lead to five. Hollis-Jefferson made a pair of free throws with 4:31 remaining to put the Raptors up 98-97, their first lead of the second half. Lowry hit a 3 on Torontos next possession, making it a four-point game. A three-point play by Brunson with 1:14 left cut it to 106-105 and Porzingis made a pair from the line with 32 seconds remaining, putting Dallas up one. Lowry fed Boucher for a go-ahead dunk and, after a Dallas timeout, Brunson missed a jumper that would have given the Mavs the lead. Boucher was fouled as he grabbed the rebound and made both free throws, putting Toronto up by three with 1.6 seconds left. Porzingis launched a game-tying shot from his own side of half before the buzzer but it fell short. The Raptors made four of 23 attempts from 3-point range through the first three quarters, then made six of 11 shots from distance in the fourth, four of them from Lowry. Dallas missed 11 straight field goal attempts to begin the game, and didnt score until Porzingis hit the second of two free throws with 6:43 left in the opening quarter. Dorian Finney-Smith made a 3 with 6:19 left in the first to halt the shooting slump. The Mavericks had more turnovers (seven) than made baskets (five) in the first, but Toronto couldnt take advantage and led 20-17 after one. Dallas used a 16-2 run in the second to lead 51-42 at halftime. The Mavericks led 86-63 through three quarters before matching the biggest blown lead in franchise history. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas G Delon Wright played in Toronto as a visitor for the first time. The Raptors drafted Wright 20th overall in 2015. He played in 172 games with Toronto before being traded to Memphis last season, part of the trade that sent Marc Gasol north of the border. The Raptors honored Wright with a tribute video at the end of the first quarter.  Brunson led Dallas with nine assists.  Six of Dallas 12 made baskets in the second were 3-pointers. Raptors: Lowry had eight rebounds.  C Dewan Hernandez (right ankle) was inactive. CALL IT A COMEBACK Torontos previous biggest comeback was from 25 down at Detroit on Dec. 11, 2010. Jerryd Bayless matched his career high with 31 points as the Raptors beat the Pistons 120-116. FANTASTIC FOURTH The Raptors set a franchise record for points in the fourth quarter with 47. It was Torontos biggest single quarter of the season. LATEST ON LUKA Doncic worked out and ran sprints on the court before the game, and is expected to take part in Mondays practice. Asked when Doncic will play again, Carlisle said the four games between Christmas and January are certainly in play.","401161081"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics found a game plan that worked in crunch time against the Charlotte Hornets. They got the ball to Jayson Tatum and got out of the way. Tatum scored 22 of his career-high 39 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 12 rebounds as Boston pulled away and beat Charlotte 119-93 on Sunday night. ""I was really happy with our team for finding him,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""As he got hot, they were locked into him."" Tatum eclipsed his previous high of 34 points against Brooklyn on Jan. 14. The promising 21-year-old forward didn't have a 30-point game before that but has now had four. ""I just try to stay aggressive no matter what,"" Tatum said. ""I feel like we've done a good job this year with (finding) different guys. Just trying to continue to make the right play but find the guy that's hot."" Kemba Walker added 23 points against his former team. Jaylen Brown had 16 points and nine rebounds, and rookie Grant Williams added 12 points off the bench for the Celtics. Boston has won three straight and seven of nine. Devonte' Graham had 23 points and 10 assists, Bismack Biyombo scored 18 and Miles Bridges 15 to lead the Hornets. Charlotte has dropped three straight and four of five. Terry Rozier scored 14 for the Hornets in his return to Boston. He left the team in free agency last summer. Rozier finished with three points on 1-of-11 shooting in a 108-87 home loss to Boston on Nov. 7. Rozier didn't get a video tribute as some ex-Celtics do in their return, but a small picture of him with the caption ""welcome back"" was hung outside the Hornets' locker room. ""Yeah, I think I need a bigger sign,"" Rozier said with a laugh. Walker had 14 points on 4-of-12 shooting in his return to Charlotte in November. Walker left the Hornets in July after eight seasons, joining the Celtics on a four-year, $141 million deal in free agency. Boston opened the game's first double-digit lead at 72-62 on a 3-pointer from the right corner by Semi Ojeleye with 7:24 left in the third quarter. Charlotte pulled within 75-73 after Biyombo's floater with 4:30 left capped an 11-3 run. Malik Monk's three-point play 13 seconds into the fourth cut the Celtics' lead to 84-80, but Tatum scored 17 of the Celtics' next 19 points to blow the game open. ""You know he's going to score at some point,"" Charlotte's Marvin Williams said of Tatum. ""You just hope he doesn't get 40 like he did tonight. He's good enough to get 40. It's just one of those nights for him."" Tatum's step-back 3-pointer with 4:30 remaining gave him a career high. Tatum's late surge reminded Rozier of what it felt like to go on a run in front of the Boston crowd. ""There's nothing better than these fans. They make you feel like you can touch the sky. He did just that,"" Rozier said. ""He's a superstar in the making and just killed us tonight."" Boston led by as many as 26 points in the closing minutes. Graham scored 17 points as Charlotte led 37-30 after one quarter, but the second-year guard was held to two in the second and Boston took a 59-56 lead into halftime. KEMBA-LIKE Graham was hot in the first quarter, going 5 for 6 from beyond the arc. Graham tied a franchise record for 3-pointers in a quarter, a record shared by ex-Hornet Walker. Graham's 17 first-quarter points also matched Walker for the most by a Hornets player in the last two seasons. NOT SO SCARY Rozier, nicknamed ""Scary Terry"" during his tenure in Boston, is a combined 7 for 28 in two games against his former team. TACKO TIME II For the second straight game, the crowd erupted when Celtics' 7-foot-5 reserve Tacko Fall stood up to check in with three and a half minutes remaining. The crowd again chanted ""MVP!"" and cheered wildly for every play Fall was involved in. Fall finished with four points, two rebounds, and a block. TIP-INS Hornets: Rookie F P.J. Washington was sidelined for a fifth straight game after fracturing his right pinkie finger on Dec. 13 at Chicago. Washington, the No. 12 overall pick in this year's draft, is averaging 12.3 points through 28 games.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo makes a fan's day by giving her his shoes and shirt, plus taking a picture on the court after the Bucks' win. (0:29) MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks gave Malcolm Brogdon a warm welcome. Then they went about their usual business. Antetokounmpo had 18 points, 19 rebounds and nine assists, and the Bucks spoiled Brogdon's return to Milwaukee with a 117-89 win over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night. ""Happy for him,"" Antetokounmpo said of Brogdon. ""We had a chance to talk a little bit before the game. Just keep getting better, man. He's going to help his team."" Wesley Matthews scored 19 points for NBA-leading Milwaukee, which has won three in a row since a 120-116 loss to Dallas stopped an 18-game win streak. Brogdon was drafted by Milwaukee and spent his first three seasons with the Bucks before he was acquired by Indiana in a sign-and-trade deal over the summer. He was welcomed back with cheers and a tribute video, and finished with 10 points on 5-of-19 shooting and 10 assists. ""It was great to be back in Fiserv (Forum),"" Brogdon said. ""These fans have been amazing to me. They were amazing to me tonight. They've been amazing to be the past three years. Just incredibly thankful for them."" The 6-foot-5 Brogdon was voted NBA Rookie of the Year in 2017. He became the eighth member of the league's 50-40-90 club last season (shooting at least 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 90% from the free-throw line). ""I would have loved (to continue) to play for this team if they had wanted me, if they had valued me the way the Pacers valued me,"" Brogdon said before the game. Brogdon scored his first points on a layup with 10:28 to play in the second quarter, giving the Pacers a 26-24 lead. Donte DiVincenzo made a layup to give Milwaukee a 56-55 advantage with 53 seconds left in the first half, and the Bucks never trailed again. Milwaukee outscored Indiana 58-34 in the second half and had a 48-34 advantage in points in the paint. ""They do a really good job of collapsing on you in the paint so it's hard to get some of those floaters and mid-range shots up,"" Pacers forward Doug McDermott said. ""So it was a little bit of an adjustment. You gotta hits 3s if you want to beat these guys and we didn't hit enough."" Domantas Sabonis had 19 points and 18 rebounds for Indiana, and McDermott finished with 15 points. The Pacers shot 12 for 40 from 3-point range. The Bucks made 15 3-pointers, including five straight in the fourth. ""I felt we were able to make plays,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Once you see one going in and somebody making a play for the guy next to him, it makes the game a lot easier and gives everybody momentum."" Brook Lopez and George Hill each had 17 points for the Bucks. Hill is averaging 16 points off the bench over the last three games. ""I think in the first half, without him, we probably would have been in a hole,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said of Hill. ""He carried us in the half. He's been doing it every night."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana has lost four straight against the Bucks dating to last season. The Pacers are 0-2 against Milwaukee this season, losing 102-83 at home on Nov. 16. Bucks: Milwaukee played its fifth game (4-1) without guard Eric Bledsoe, who fractured his right leg against the Memphis Grizzles on Dec. 13. Bledsoe is expected to miss about two weeks.","401161083"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George's return to Oklahoma City was spoiled by a player the Thunder got back when they traded him. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander matched his career high with 32 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder rallied to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 118-112 on Sunday night. George, who finished third in the MVP voting last season, was sent to the Clippers for Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari in a deal that began the restructuring of the Thunder roster. George was cheered when he was introduced during the starting lineups. ""It was great,"" he said. ""It made me feel appreciated, just being here. I enjoyed my time here."" George scored 18 points, but he made just 6 of 17 shots and had five turnovers. Gilgeous-Alexander made 12 of 25 field goals. Oklahoma City trailed by 18 points in the second quarter, making it the third time in seven days the Thunder overcame a deficit that big to win. This time, the victory came against the No. 2 team in the Western Conference standings. ""That's a really good team over there,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""Obviously, they've been in all type of different situations. It's good. It's really good, especially they way we were down in the first half."" Los Angeles scoring leader Kawhi Leonard sat out because of left knee soreness. Dennis Schroder scored 16 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and Steven Adams added 20 points and 17 rebounds to help the Thunder win their fourth straight. Oklahoma City has won nine of 12 to move above .500 for the first time this season. ""You just go on chemistry, being more comfortable with the offense, defense, you could do all that sort of stuff,"" Adams said. ""Figuring out playing habits -- you could go on, mate."" Lou Williams scored 22 points for Los Angeles, and Montrezl Harrell had 18. The Clippers led 63-57 at the half, with Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 19 points for the Thunder. Gilgeous-Alexander's layup tied it at 66 in the third quarter. After the Clippers seemed to regain control, the Thunder remained competitive. Paul's 3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer cut it to 89-86. With 5:35 to play, Harrell appeared to score and draw a foul from Nerlens Noel. The basket would have given the Clippers a 100-94 lead with a free throw coming. The Thunder challenged the call and it was changed to a charge on Harrell. The Clippers weren't sure if the challenge worked as it was supposed to. Some time passed as Harrell waited to shoot the free throw. ""I just thought the delay was strange,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We kept asking, 'What was the delay for? What was the delay for?' The ref kept holding the ball."" The Thunder took advantage. Schroder's 3-pointer put the Thunder ahead, then Adams had a steal and a layup to make it 110-106 with 1:19 to play. After the Thunder got a stop, Schroder's layup put the Thunder up by six. ""I think as mad as we are that we're letting games get away early, we're starting to figure out how to win them now,"" Paul said. ""We've got to keep it going. Even if we're not making shots, knowing we can get stops. Really good teams in this league -- that's when they buckle down -- the fourth quarter."" TIP-INS Clippers: Patrick Patterson, who played for the Thunder last season, started and also was cheered during pregame introductions. ... G Patrick Beverley sat out with a sore right groin.

"LOS ANGELES --  Buoyed by a perfect five-game homestand, the Denver Nuggets hit the road and kept on winning. Paul Millsap scored 21 points and the Nuggets dominated the second half in defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without LeBron James, 128-104 on Sunday night for their sixth win in a row. ""Our last homestand gave us confidence to come on the road and win,"" Millsap said. ""We have so many weapons."" The Nuggets had six players in double figures. Gary Harris added 19 points, Nikola Jokic had 18 points, Malik Beasley had 16 points and Will Barton III had 14 points and a career-high-tying 13 rebounds for the Nuggets, who pulled away to a 23-point lead early in the fourth. ""It feels good to get a win in L.A. even if LeBron wasn't playing,"" Jokic said. James missed his first game of the season because of a thoracic muscle strain. That left the Lakers without his 25.8 point average and 10.6 assists. ""It's kind of hard to next-man-up LeBron,"" said Kyle Kuzma, the only other Laker in double figures with 16 points. ""He does so much. Shots come easier when he's on the floor because everyone just looks at him."" With James looking on in street clothes, Anthony Davis did his best to make up for it with 32 points and 11 rebounds. He scored 11 points playing all 12 minutes of the first quarter. ""It's tough when he's out but we still got to find ways to win,"" Davis said. ""We lost our energy defensively. We got to continue to defend and once we get that edge back we'll be fine."" Davis slipped and tweaked his right leg in the third quarter, but felt good enough to play 7 1/2 minutes in the fourth. ""Hopefully nothing significant happens,"" he said. The Lakers can't afford to have Davis go down at the same time as James with a Christmas game against the Clippers looming. The Western Conference-leading Lakers have lost three in a row since winning seven straight. Kuzma returned after missing five games with a sprained left ankle. ""This is probably the healthiest I've been all season,"" he said. ""Just got to get my legs back a little bit."" Millsap was questionable to play because of a left knee contusion, but he consistently scored with Davis and Kuzma in the lineup late in the second quarter. His 3-pointer put the Nuggets up 55-53 at the break. Denver scored 73 points in the second half while holding the Lakers to 51 points. ""It was the best game we've had from start to finish this season,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Our starters played well and our second unit played outstanding. When we do that we are hard to beat."" The Lakers successfully challenged a goaltending call against Davis midway through the third that took a basket away from the Nuggets. But Denver responded with a 23-11 run to take a 91-78 lead into the fourth. Seven players scored during the spurt, led by Millsap with seven. ""We came out more aggressive in the second half and got rebounds and knocked down our shots and played excellent defense,"" Millsap said. The Nuggets opened the fourth with a 17-7 run with Harris and Beasley doing all the scoring that gave them a 108-85 lead. Beasley had nine points, making two 3-pointers, and Harris had eight. ""We played a great team basketball game,"" Jokic said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Improved to 4-0 in the first game of a back-to-back. ... Their three-game road skid ended. Lakers: They fell to 10-3 at home. ... Rajon Rondo made his first start of the season and had five points and eight assists. ... There was a pregame moment of silence for JoAnn Buss, the former wife of late Lakers owner Jerry Buss and mother of their four children, who now own the franchise.

"CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Cavaliers' backcourt of the future pushed them to victory Monday night. Rookies Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr. took over in the fourth quarter and the Cavaliers held off a late Atlanta comeback for a 121-118 victory. Collin Sexton, a second-year player, scored 25 points while Garland had 21 and Porter added 15. Garland had 10 points and Porter added nine in the final period. The two will take on a bigger role after the Cavaliers agreed to trade veteran guard Jordan Clarkson to Utah for guard Dante Exum before the game. Porter and Garland are both 19 years old, and dealing with a teammate being traded was a new experience. ""I've never been in this situation,"" Porter said. ""It was kind of devastating. For the first three quarters I kept thinking about it. It's not a good feeling, but you've got to keep going."" The Cavaliers will also receive two future second-round draft picks in the trade, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press. Cleveland will get a pick in 2022 and one in 2023, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the teams have not yet had the required conference call with the NBA to approve the swap. The deal came together shortly before the Jazz played in Miami and the Cavs' game began. Clarkson warmed up on the floor at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse before he was informed of the trade. Cleveland has won three straight for the first time since taking five in a row from March 28 to April 5, 2018 in LeBron James' final season with the team. ""It shows that we are improving,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""I don't know if we win this game a month ago."" Trae Young scored 30 points, but his 3-pointer that would have tied the game in the closing seconds hit off the front of the rim and sent Atlanta to its eighth straight defeat. ""We've got to take way more pride on the defensive end,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""That's what competition is. It's personal pride. I don't know how you make guys mentally tough. That's where it is right now."" Cleveland built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter before the Hawks rallied. Young scored eight points in the quarter and Atlanta had a chance to tie with 5.1 seconds to go after a Cavaliers' miss. The Hawks set up for a final shot, but Young's attempt from about 30 feet fell short. Atlanta forward John Collins returned from a 25-game suspension for violating of the NBA's drug policy. He was in the starting lineup and scored 27 points with 10 rebounds. Kevin Love had 20 points for the Cavaliers. Cleveland led 71-64 at halftime, scoring a season high in points for a half. TIP-INS Hawks: C Bruno Fernando took Love's elbow in the mouth in the third quarter and went to the locker room with a towel to his face. He did not return. ... Backup Alex Len sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and didn't return. Cavaliers: Beilein hopes rookie guard Dylan Windler, who has been out all season with a stress reaction in his left leg, will play in January. Windler missed training camp with the injury and played for Canton of the G League before being shut down a couple of weeks ago. COLLINS RETURNS Collins was suspended Nov. 5. He averaged 17 points and 8.8 rebounds in the first five games of the season. Atlanta went 4-21 without Collins, who is in his third season. ""It knocks the rust off, going against a guy like Kevin Love,"" he said. ""I felt good, OK."" SHORT-HANDED In addition to Clarkson's departure, Larry Nance Jr. missed the game for Cleveland because of a sore left knee. The 6-foot-7 forward averages 8.6 points and 7.2 rebounds. ""He's sort of a Swiss Army knife out there,"" Beilein said of Nance's versatility. ""He does a lot of things.""","401161086"
"DETROIT --  Two years ago, the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Clippers made a blockbuster trade, with Blake Griffin coming to the Motor City in exchange for Tobias Harris. Monday, it appeared the long-term winner of the trade has been the Philadelphia 76ers. Harris outscored Griffin 35-8 and Ben Simmons added a triple-double as the 76ers beat the Pistons 125-109, ""We were able to get our offense rolling, score, get stops and get out in transition"", said Harris, who was traded to Philadelphia in February. ""We did a good job of just attacking."" Joel Embiid had 20 points and eight rebounds for the 76ers, who improved to 11-4 in their last 15 games. Simmons finished with 16 points, a career-high 17 assists and 13 rebounds. ""I was just sharing the ball, moving with pace and trying to tighten any gaps,"" he said. Reserve Furkan Korkmaz added a career-high 21. ""Furkan gave us some good contributions,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""We had 33 assists and 12 turnovers, which is an incredible ratio -- Ben had 17 of those assists -- and I especially liked our offensive rebounding."" Andre Drummond had 27 for the Pistons, who have lost five in a row. Griffin, who had missed the previous two games with knee soreness, scored eight points on 2-for-14 shooting. ""I've got no excuse,"" said Griffin, who has also been dealing with flu-like symptoms. ""I've just got to be better. I'm used to contributing more and I just haven't been able to do that."" The Pistons rebounded a season-low 59% of Philadelphia's missed shots. Detroit's three lowest defensive-rebound percentages of the season, all under 70%, have come in the last three games. ""We've been looking at it, believe me,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""Some of it is just boxing out, but a lot of it is guys coming in from the corners. It's a little bit of everything. Guys are shooting in and we don't have vision of them, and when Andre helps on someone, we have to crack down on his man."" Korkmaz had 10 points in the third period to help the Sixers build a 10-point lead, but Derrick Rose's layup made it 94-86 going into the fourth. Philadelphia forced three turnovers in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter and expanded their lead to 103-92. After that, its dominant rebounding kept the Pistons from getting back into the game. Drummond sat out the first 8:42 of the game after missing shootaround Monday morning. It was the first time he had come off the bench since his rookie season. ""That's a team rule,"" Casey said. ""We might be getting our butts kicked on the floor, but we're going to have discipline."" The Sixers led by as many as 12 in the first half, but Svi Mykhailiuk and Markieff Morris combined for 19 points to keep Detroit within 60-52. Late in the half, Harris threw a misplaced lob to Simmons, who was able to reach back and make a reverse layup. On the next possession, the pair flipped roles, with Harris guiding a Simmons alley-oop into the basket. ""He had a small defender, and I know he can make spectacular plays, so I just threw the ball in the air,"" Harris said. ""He made a crazy layup and the next time he threw me one like I have athleticism like he does. I managed to get it in, so that was cool."" Tim Frazier scored seven points in the first four minutes of the third, helping the Pistons tie the game at 65, but the 48-30 rebounding deficit was too much for Detroit to overcome. ""I think a lot of the problem is coming from transition defense,"" Griffin said. ""We're not getting matched up, so we're all trying to pick up someone we aren't used to guarding from a position we're not used to playing."" TIP INS 76ers: The Sixers have beaten the Pistons five straight times and are 5-0 at Little Caesars Arena. Pistons: Griffin, Christian Wood and Rose all played despite knee issues, but Bruce Brown (calf) and Luke Kennard (knee) missed the game. STRUGGLES AT HOME The Pistons have lost five straight at home, matching their longest streak since moving to Little Caesars Arena in 2017. LINGERING BAD FEELINGS Griffin and Harris had to be separated with 5:21 to play. Both players were issued technicals, just as Simmons and Wood had been after a third-quarter disagreement. BEST IN 51 YEARS Simmons became the first 76er to have at least 16 points, 17 assists and 13 rebounds since Wilt Chamberlain did it twice in 1968.","401161087"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Aaron Holiday likened the back-and-forth test of resiliency against the defending NBA champions to that of a playoff game. Each time the Indiana Pacers or Toronto Raptors sank a dramatic shot, the intensity level increased that much more, the escalating emotion eventually spilling into overtime. That's when Holiday hit his two most important attempts, both 3-pointers, to help the host Pacers snap the Raptors' five-game win streak with a 120-115 overtime triumph on Monday. ""It's a big win for us,"" said Holiday, who finished with 19 points in getting the start at point guard for the injured Malcolm Brogdon. ""It's fun playing with emotion, especially in big games."" His fourth 3-pointer of the game gave the Pacers a 116-113 lead with 2:05 remaining in overtime. His fifth and final 3-pointer provided a 119-115 advantage with 54 seconds remaining. ""It just shows the toughness, 48-plus minutes, we're going to be relentless on both ends,"" said T.Y. Warren, who along with Myles Turner led the Pacers with 24 points apiece. ""I'm glad the way we responded, tough shots and we got some key stops at the end."" The Pacers (21-10) set a franchise record with 42 3-pointers attempted and matched a season high with 18 made. That included four in the fourth quarter and overtime. The Raptors (21-9) missed 17 of their first 19 shots from 3-point range in falling behind by 15 points in the second quarter. They eventually rallied, despite finishing 11 of 40 from beyond the arc. Both teams missed potential game-winning shots in the final minute of regulation as Holiday's layup was too long off the glass before Kyle Lowry's last-second 3-pointer bounced off the front of the rim. Lowry tried his best to be the hero for a second consecutive night in leading all scorers with 30 points. He scored 32 points in a record comeback win from 30 points down at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. ""We gutted it out, we played our butts off and gave ourselves a chance to win at the end,"" Lowry said of the Raptors, who were missing two starters due to injuries. ""Unfortunately, we came up short."" Lowry managed just two points in overtime, when the Pacers outscored the Raptors 13-8. ""We got ourselves a five-point lead, probably should have put it away there but give them credit,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of the Pacers' fourth-quarter deficit. ""A bunch of 3's late, a bunch in the fourth quarter, a bunch in overtime."" Serge Ibaka added 23 and Fred VanVleet 21 for the Raptors The Pacers' Myles Turner sank 5 of 6 3-pointers in finishing 9 of 12 from the floor. ""Resilience, that's what we showed tonight,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""That's one of the better teams in the conference. We knew they were going to be a team that scrapped, and our guys came and they fought. They kept their composure throughout the game, despite losing the lead, and stayed with it.""

"NEW YORK --  Washington coach Scott Brooks understands how difficult it has been for Gary Payton II to find a spot in the league since going undrafted three years ago. The 27-year-old guard could hang around for a while if he continues to play the way he did Monday night. Payton finished with 10 points, 11 rebounds and five assists off the bench to help the short-handed Wizards outlast the New York Knicks 121-115. With almost half their roster out due to injuries, the Wizards had to reach out to the G League to grab an extra body even before they learned that Isaiah Thomas was going to be hit with a two-game suspension for entering the stands to confront a fan during Saturday night's game in Philadelphia. Payton took a red-eye flight from Las Vegas that night and landed in Washington on Sunday. A physical exam came back fine and Payton was off to New York on an Amtrak train. ""Hopefully, he sticks and plays a long time in this league. He has what every coach wants. Defensive toughness. A presence,"" Brooks said. ""Makes winning basketball plays. It's remarkable. He flies in and meets with me for two minutes. He meets with our staff and has a breakfast meeting and plays so well. Give him credit."" Bradley Beal scored 30 points and Troy Brown Jr. added 26 off the bench for the Wizards, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Ish Smith added 17 and Anzej Pasecniks, who's on a two-way contract, chipped in 14 for a Washington team that only had nine healthy players ready at tip-off. Payton was one of them and certainly didn't disappoint. ""They told me they were short-handed and I was going to go. I was prepared to go,"" Payton said. ""They told me about the basic schemes and what not. We went over a few plays on offense."" The son of Hall of Famer Gary Payton, who was nicknamed `The Glove' because of his defensive presence, Payton wasn't too shabby on that end of the court as he finished with six steals over a career-high 34 minutes. He picked up whatever he could during a pregame meeting with the coaching staff that lasted no more than 10 minutes. ""He just took advantage of his opportunities given and he's a true talent,"" Beal said. Julius Randle had 35 points and reserve Damyean Dotson added 19 for New York, which lost its third straight. Randle was critical of New York's lack of focus, which he traced all the way back to the team's morning shootaround at its practice facility despite jumping on Washington early to start the game. ""I think our approach the whole day was terrible,"" Randle said. ""From shootaround on, I think we had a bad approach as a team collectively, top to bottom, myself included. We could have been better. We jumped out on them, got the lead and didn't sustain it. Washington trailed by 13 points late in the first quarter before heading into halftime down 64-63. The Wizards then went on a 14-0 run to open up the second half and seemed on their way to an easy win after increasing the lead to 116-99 with 4:40 remaining before New York stormed back. New York then went on a 16-2 run, highlighted by Mitchell Robinson's hustle in the paint for a dunk that cut the lead to 118-113 with 1:20 left. On the next possession, Robinson swatted Beal's layup, leading to Randle's layup on the other end that made it 118-115 with 48 seconds to play. Brown then missed a 3-pointer, but Elfrid Payton missed a potential tying 3 from the top of the arc. Brown then hit three straight free throws to seal it for Washington. TIP-INS Wizards: F Jason Robinson made his first NBA start. He was recalled from Capital City Go-Go, Washington's G-League affiliate. . Beal attempted a career-high 38 shots. He made 13. Knicks: F Marcus Morris (sore left Achilles tendon) did not play. . Veteran forward Taj Gibson (illness) was also held out. . Payton had 12 assists. RIGHT AND WRONG Brooks understood where the league was coming from when it issued its suspension of Thomas, but also called for improved control over fans attending games. ""I understand the rule. The rule is there and it's a good rule,"" Brooks said. ""But I think we also have to be cognizant that we have to control some of the fans. What they say, it's just out of control at certain places."" FILLING IN Payton was averaging 21.4 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists for the South Bay Lakers and was the G League player of the week for the week ending Dec. 16.

"MIAMI --  Derrick Jones Jr. knows there is some debate over whether he dunked on two-time reigning defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert, and his stance on the matter could not be clearer. ""It was a dunk,"" Jones insisted. Gobert may have thought otherwise. Doesn't matter. The numbers on the scoreboard were absolute. Jimmy Butler scored 20 points, Bam Adebayo scored 18 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and the Miami Heat survived a huge night from Gobert to beat the Utah Jazz 107-104 on Monday night -- improving the NBA's best home record to 13-1. ""We found a way just to grit it out and a different way to win,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Against a team like that, that's a heck of a win."" The Heat were down by seven late in the third, then went on a 21-4 run to take a 10-point lead early in the fourth -- and stayed ahead the rest of the way. Tyler Herro scored nine of his 17 points in the fourth for Miami. ""I'll take the blame for that. It's on me,"" said Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell, who shot 5 for 18 and finished with 13 points. ""He kicked my (butt) on three straight possessions."" Goran Dragic scored 15 for Miami, which outrebounded the Jazz 55-46 and ended Utah's season-best five-game winning streak.

But Butler hit a pair of free throws for Miami moments later, sealing the outcome. ""I thought we got tired,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We had some really good looks. And then not getting stops doesn't give you an opportunity to score off your defense."" Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 for Utah. Gobert had a huge night -- 18 points on 9 for 11 shooting, a season-high 20 rebounds and five blocks. ""He's super-smart,"" Spoelstra said. Heat fans were standing at the end. They had another highlight worth remembering in the second quarter -- when one of the game's best dunkers took on the two-time defensive player of the year. Jones went into the lane, took off about five feet from the basket and scored over Gobert. It was officially recorded as a dunk, and Jones said he made contact with the rim on his follow-through. Jones headed to the other end, hands on either side of his head in disbelief of what he had done. Twitter lit up with the consensus being that Gobert had been posterized, and the Heat guard agreed. ""That's for sure,"" Jones said. Shortly before the game, the Jazz agreed to trade little-used reserve guard Dante Exum and a pair of future second-round picks to Cleveland for Jordan Clarkson. Exum averaged 2.2 points in 11 appearances this season; he was on the active roster for the game, but his locker was cleaned out not long afterward. TIP-INS Jazz: Ingles played in his 334th consecutive game, extending the NBA's longest active streak. ... Mitchell had seven assists, but the Jazz managed only 17 on 39 field goals. Heat: Miami announced a sellout for the 433rd consecutive time, including playoffs, which ties for the sixth-longest streak in NBA history. ... Duncan Robinson's team-record streak of 14 straight games with multiple 3-pointers ended. He had one. WAITERS RETURNING Monday's game marked the end of Dion Waiters' latest suspension, his third of the season -- of the one-, 10- and now six-game varieties. Waiters has not played this season and it's unclear when or if the Heat will put him back on the floor. But he will be permitted to attend practices again later this week, and games again starting Friday. EARLY TROUBLE Bogdanovic hadn't committed more than one first-quarter foul in any game this season -- then got whistled for three in a span of six minutes of the opening quarter on Monday. The only other Jazz player with three first-quarter fouls in a game this season was Jeff Green, who did it against Minnesota on Nov. 20. It was Bogdanovic's first three-foul opening quarter of his career.","401161091"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The San Antonio Spurs scored early, often and at a season-best shooting pace both overall and from 3-point range. The combination, along with 40 points from LaMarcus Aldridge and 26 points, plus 10 assists from DeMar DeRozan, contributed to a 145-115 rout of the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. San Antonio shot 67.4% overall, 62.5% from 3-point range and recorded its season-high point total. DeRozan would miss only one of his 11 shots; Aldridge was 17 of 25 from the field. The 67.4% from the field was the best shooting percentage in an NBA game this season. The 36 assists also were a season high. ""It was just one of those nights,"" said Aldridge, who also had nine rebounds and five assists. ""We've had nights where we've been on the other end of it, where we couldn't throw it in the lake."" As the positive records fell the way of San Antonio, the misery landed on the Grizzlies. The 145 points were the most ever given up by the franchise, and the 46 first-quarter points by the Spurs were the most ever scored against the Grizzlies in a quarter. ""They played unbelievable tonight,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""They had a response for everything we were throwing out there coverage-wise, schematic-wise. .They had a heck of a shooting night, especially from the midrange, the rim, the 3s, all that."" Trey Lyles finished with 17 points and Dejounte Murray scored 14 for the Spurs. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 22 points for Memphis, converting 8 of 14 shots and 6 of 9 from 3-point range. Rookie Ja Morant finished with 19 points, and Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and 12 rebounds as Memphis lost for the third time in the last four. The Spurs were uncanny in their shooting accuracy from the start, connecting at 79% in the first quarter -- and that included missing their final two shots in the period. While San Antonio couldn't keep that pace, it dropped only slightly. The Spurs were 31 of 42 in the second half (73.8%) and made 7 of 12 3-pointers. ""It is just about letting that build our confidence,"" DeRozan said. ""Go out there and be consistent. Go out that and play like this -- especially on the defensive end -- every single night."" With the Spurs shooting, Memphis never really had a chance at overtaking San Antonio once the first-quarter lead reached 19. There were a few times the Grizzlies got the deficit under double-digits in the second half but never less than eight. The San Antonio lead eventually swelled to the final 30-point margin. ""They have a lot of shooters,"" Morant said. ""All shot it great. It's hard when they are hitting a lot of shots. . It's rare for a team to shoot how they shot."" TIP-INS Spurs: Hit 19 of their first 22 shots. The streak of made baskets went so long that once Aldridge missed a shot late in the first quarter, it drew a loud cheer from the Memphis faithful. . Aldridge reached at least 30 points for the fourth time this season. . Marco Belinelli had 10 points. Grizzlies: Valanciunas returned to the starting lineup after missing Saturday's game against Sacramento with right foot soreness. He recorded his 16th double-double. .The 145 points given up by Memphis were the most this season. The previous high was 138 by Dallas on Nov. 9. NOT THE WORST NIGHT The 30-point loss was not the worst of the season for Memphis. The Grizzlies lost by 32 at Orlando, 118-86, on Nov. 8. ""Defense is the thing we hit all the time,"" Jenkins said. ""Not trying to downplay this, but it's been 30 games and this is the first time (in a while) that we've gotten our rear end handed to us."" LAST WORD The Spurs were in a similar situation to the Grizzlies on Saturday when they lost at home to the Clippers 134-109. And, even a coach of few words, like San Antonio's Gregg Popovich, recognized the swing in fortunes. ""(LaMarcus) and DeMar led the way. It was great to see the whole team jump in. We had a bad game last game. This is the way you react to something like that.""","401161092"
"PHOENIX --  Jamal Murray shot fearlessly in the final seconds, with only one thought on his mind: winning. Denver's been doing a lot of that lately. I was just in a zone, not thinking about anything really, Murray said. Just in a zone. Everybody was locked in. Murray made a tiebreaking jumper with 3.2 seconds left, Nikola Jokic finished with a triple-double and the Nuggets rallied for a 113-111 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Monday night. Murray finished with 28 points on 12-of-19 shooting from the field, including 4 of 8 shooting on 3-pointers. Jokic had 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his seventh triple-double of this season. The Nuggets extended their winning streak to seven games while the Suns have lost seven in row. The teams traded clutch shots in the final moments. First it was Murray who hit a 3-pointer with 27 seconds left to push Denver ahead 111-108. Two seconds later, Devin Booker nailed a 3-pointer off an inbounds play to tie it. Murray had one more big shot in him, making a jumper just inside the 3-point line with 3.2 seconds left to give the Nuggets a 113-111 lead. Booker had a 3-point attempt blocked by Jerami Grant just before the final buzzer. Down the stretch, (Murray) was phenomenal, Denver coach Michael Malone said. This wasn't our best game, but when you don't play your best on the road, you have to find ways and that is what I'm proud about. The Suns trailed for most of the night, falling behind by 16 points in the second quarter, but slowly fought their way back. The Nuggets hit 12 of their first 17 3-point attempts but finally cooled off midway through the third quarter and missed their next seven from long range. That allowed Phoenix to make a push and Frank Kaminsky's short jumper early in the fourth quarter gave the Suns an 83-82 lead, their first since the first quarter. Rookie Cameron Johnson hit two 3-pointers in a row -- one on a bank shot -- to put the Suns ahead 91-88 with about 9 minutes left in the game. Phoenix pushed that advantage to 101-92 but Denver rallied to tie it at 108 with 2 minutes left on Jokic's 3-pointer. The Suns haven't won a game in two weeks and this one hurt more than most. That was a tough one, Johnson said. I felt like we had a lot of momentum going into that fourth quarter, halfway through and that's a tough one. I really though we were going to pull that one out. Ricky Rubio scored 21 points for the Suns. Eight Phoenix players scored in double figures, but it wasn't enough to snap its lengthy losing streak. It's the deep hurt that allows you to grow, Suns coach Monty Williams said. It's a life principle, and certainly in sports. We have to start closing these games out. I thought some of our possessions, we just missed shots or made passes that just weren't there. Five minutes to go in the game, that's a playoff game and everything has to be executed well. Denver jumped out to a 34-22 by the end of the first quarter after shooting 67 percent from the field but the Suns were able to cut the deficit to 56-49 by halftime. Murray had 10 points in the first half. Rubio had 16 before the break on 7-of-10 shooting from the field. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was playing its third game in four days. ... The Nuggets hit 10 of 15 3-pointers in the first half. ... The Nuggets improve their record to 21-9, matching last season and the 1976-77 season for the best 30-game start in the franchise's NBA history. Suns: Starting center Deandre Ayton missed a third straight game because of a sprained ankle. He's played in just two out of the team's first 30 games. ... Rubio returned to the starting lineup after missing Saturday's game against the Rockets because of an illness. ... The Suns fell to 1-6 this season in one-possession games.","401161093"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  For a Portland team looking to ride a five-game winning streak into Christmas, Monday night was a bad time for Damian Lillard to have one of the worst shooting games of his career. Jrue Holiday scored 21 points, Brandon Ingram had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans capitalized on Lillard's shooting struggles to beat the Trail Blazers 102-94. The Pelicans held Portland to just 48 points in the second half, the lowest mark the Pelicans have surrendered in a half this season, and won for the second time in three games. ""There's a big thing in the NBA about 3s and layups and we try to take away at least one of them,"" Holiday said. ""Tonight they had a lot of paint points but how they shot the 3 was in our favor."" Carmelo Anthony had 23 points and nine rebounds but Portland had its four-game winning streak snapped. Hassan Whiteside added 16 rebounds and 11 points. Portland's backcourt duo of Lillard and CJ McCollum was a combined 2 for 20 from the 3-point line. Lillard had an especially tough night, going 0 for 10 beyond the arc, the first time in his career that he's failed to make a 3-pointer while attempting at least nine. His previous low mark was 0 for 8 in his rookie season. ""First time for everything,"" Lillard said. ""Tonight was one of those nights. I've been scoring and shooting the ball well enough in this league where it's not something I'm about to go and stay up over."" The Blazers shot 13.8% from the 3-point line, tying a franchise worst in percentage with at least 25 attempts, going 4 for 29. New Orleans, on the other hand, was 15 for 35 from the 3-point line. The Pelicans outscored the Blazers 45-12 behind the arc. ""We were into it,"" Lillard said of his team's effort. ""But if you make four 3s and they make 15, it's going to be hard to win."" Derrick Favors had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Pelicans, while JJ Redick had 16 points. Anthony had 11 points in the first half of his return from injury, including a steal and 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer to tie the game at 31. However, Anthony's 3-pointer was the only one the Blazers made in 12 attempts in the first half. Lillard finished 6 of 21. He didn't make a field goal in the fourth quarter until there were 58 seconds left. The Blazers led 56-54 at halftime but the Pelicans made six 3-pointers in the third quarter and pushed the ball while Portland continued to struggle shooting the ball from the outside. Anthony had eight points in the third quarter to help keep Portland within single digits. A 3-pointer by Holiday gave the Pelicans a 95-88 lead with 7:09 left in the game. A dunk by Kenrich Williams gave the Pelicans their biggest lead of the game at 101-91 with 3:34 left. TIP-INS Pelicans: Zion Williamson hasn't played yet this season but while the Pelicans aren't giving many details about his rehab, Williamson looks like someone who is getting closer to playing condition. Williamson worked up a sweat on Monday night after going through a 20-minute workout prior to the game after participating the Pelicans' shootaround earlier in the day. ""He's done some stuff,"" Gentry said. ""But as I said we're taking it slow and he's working his butt off to get back out on the court. When the time comes, we'll put him out there."" The Pelicans say they will be overly cautious. Trail Blazers: After missing the better part of the last two games, the Trail Blazers got Anthony back. Anthony banged knees with an opposing player in Portland's win on Friday over the Orlando Magic and left after playing only 10 minutes. ""He's been working with the health and performance department over the last three games and it just gradually got to the point where he feels good to play,"" coach Terry Stotts said.","401161094"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  One week after setting a franchise record by coming back from 25 point down to win, the Houston Rockets nearly went the other way after taking a big lead against Sacramento. Like it has much of the season, Houston's defense made the difference down the stretch when the Rockets offense went silent. James Harden scored 34 points, Russell Westbrook had 28 and the Rockets overcame one of their worst fourth quarters of the season to beat the Kings 113-104 on Monday night. ""I thought we did a good job defending at a high rate, staying true to ourselves and leaning on our defense, not our offense,"" Westbrook said. ""We lean on our defense every night. We have obviously a great offense, a lethal offense, but we lean on our defense."" Clint Capela added 15 points and 14 rebounds as the Rockets won their seventh straight on the road. It didn't come easily. Two weeks after losing to the Kings on Nemanja Bjelica's buzzer-beating 33-footer, the Rockets squandered most of a 25-point lead before holding on at the end. That was in stark contrast to Houston's win over San Antonio on Dec. 16 when the Rockets rallied from down and beat the Spurs 109-107. ""A 10- or 15-point lead was like a five-point lead back in the day,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""They got hot and they did what they were supposed to do. We made some mistakes but a win here is a good win."" The Rockets won despite shooting 3 of 17 in the fourth quarter. All three baskets were 3-pointers, including one by Westbrook that put Houston ahead 107-96 after the Kings had pulled within six. Harden made a 3-pointer then added a pair of late free throws. ""We just got lax,"" Harden said. ""That's just human nature. You get up 18, 20 points and you start doing things that you weren't doing to gain the lead. It happens."" De'Aaron Fox tied his career-high of 31 points and had nine rebounds and six assists for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes added 12 points and 14 rebounds. The Kings have lost four straight. ""We didn't do the little things well enough tonight to win the game,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. Houston built a 16-point lead in the first quarter despite slow starts by Harden and Westbrook. The two took five shots total in the opening period and had nine points combined, while House and Capela handled the scoring load early. The Rockets big two got going after that. Harden scored 13 in the second quarter and Westbrook had 10. Houston pulled away in the third and led 86-61 following a short jumper by Harden. TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook's streak of 30 points or more ended at three games. . Ben McLemore scored eight points against his former team. McLemore was Sacramento's first-round pick (seventh overall) in 2013. Kings: Trevor Ariza had 12 points and six rebounds off the bench. . Bogdan Bogdanovic (right ankle soreness) did not play. HIELD SITS OUT FOURTH Buddy Hield is Sacramento's leading scorer but was on the bench the entire fourth quarter. He finished with 10 points on 3 of 12 shooting. ""I played the guys that had it going,"" Walton said. ""It wasn't a punishment at all. It was more, `Look, we're a team and we're trying to win out here and if these guys are going well, well then we keep rolling with them."" DON'T FORGET Westbrook said Bjelica's buzzer-beater on Dec. 9 was a source of motivation going into the game. ""We definitely had it on our radar and I made sure that we all knew that coming in,"" Westbrook said. MISSED FREEBIES Fox scored 19 in the fourth quarter but missed five free throws over the final 6 minutes.","401161095"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  For a team that went to the NBA Finals five straight years and came away with three championships over that stretch, it might not seem like much. But considering where the Golden State Warriors are at, winning consecutive games for the first time this season qualifies as progress. D'Angelo Russell scored 30 points, Alec Burks had 25 points and eight assists, and the Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-104 on Monday night. ""I think it's good man, in the way we're winning too,"" Russell said. ""We're growing. ""It's not like we just so happened to be making shots . we're getting better with the little things that we've found a way to lose games with. Rebounding, free throws, box (outs), all that little stuff."" Draymond Green added 14 rebounds and nine points and Damion Lee had 14 points for Golden State, which won consecutive games for the first time since last season's Western Conference finals. ""It feels ... amazing,"" Green said. ""I never thought I'd be so excited for two regular-season wins in my life."" Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points and Jordan McLaughlin had 19 for the Timberwolves, who dropped their 11th straight. Jeff Teague added 12 points for Minnesota. The Warriors broke open a tie game midway through the second quarter with an 18-3 run to take a 53-38 lead. Green scored on a hook shot with 2:30 left in the first half to cap the run. The Warriors opened up a 64-47 lead after starting the third quarter on a 7-0 run. The Warriors led 82-58 late in the third quarter on Omari Spellman's layup. Minnesota went on a 14-2 run to close within 84-72 early in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves closed to 109-104 with 22 seconds left when McLaughlin was fouled on a dunk and completed the three-point play with a free throw. The Timberwolves are 5-19 since a 125-119 win over Golden State on Nov. 8 in which Russell scored 52 points and Wiggins had 40. ""It's no secret we're in a funk right now,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Young team or not, we've got to learn lessons in this league, because you've got to go through hard times to get to where you want to be."" The Warriors are playing their best ball ahead of a Christmas home game against the Houston Rockets that will be seen by a national audience. ""We need this regardless of what's coming next,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""We just needed to win a couple of games in a row just to get a little momentum and feel good. Christmas is always a special day to play on, you know that everybody's watching. It's got a different vibe, a different feel, and our players will be really excited it'll be good to go into that game with momentum.""

"TORONTO --  Bostons Jaylen Brown celebrated Christmas with something he had never enjoyed before: a road win at Toronto. Brown scored 30 points, Kemba Walker had 22 and the Celtics beat the Raptors 118-102 Wednesday in the first Christmas Day NBA game played in Canada. It was good to get a win here on Christmas, said Brown, who made five 3-pointers and shot 10 for 13 from the field. Ive never won here period, so it was great to just get one. Enes Kanter had 12 points and 11 rebounds as the Celtics snapped an eight-game losing streak north of the border and became the first Atlantic Division opponent to win in Toronto in more than four years. The Celtics have won four straight to improve to 8-2 in December. Bostons Gordon Hayward returned to the starting lineup after missing the past three games because of a sore left foot. He scored 14 points in 26 minutes. Its still a little sore but its playable, Hayward said. Its good, its good. Fred VanVleet scored 27 points in the Raptors' second straight loss, and Chris Boucher had a career-high 24. We werent quite physical enough, I thought, for most stretches of the game, Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. The Raptors are 2-2 since losing center Marc Gasol (left hamstring), guard Norman Powell (left shoulder) and forward Pascal Siakam (groin) to injuries. Nurse had no update on the status of the trio, but acknowledged their absence is making life difficult. Scoring is not very easy for us right now, Nurse said. Its tough. Toronto had gone an NBA-record 34 games between home losses to division foes. The Raptors last home loss to an Atlantic team was a 111-109 defeat to the New York Knicks on Nov. 10, 2015. Kyle Lowry scored 14 points and Serge Ibaka had 12 for Toronto. The Raptors shot 8 for 23 from 3-point range. Kanter arrived dressed in a black t-shirt that read Freedom for ALL in white letters. He played outside the United States for the first time since visiting Toronto with the Knicks on Nov. 10, 2018. Definitely amazing, a smiling Kanter said. I just cant describe it with words. Just going out there was more than just a basketball game. For me, it was just going out there and living this freedom. Kanters outspoken criticism of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government led to his passport being revoked in 2017. Turkish prosecutors have accused Kanter of membership in a terror organization and issued an international warrant for his arrest. Kanter did not travel with the Knicks to London last January because he feared he could be killed over his opposition to Erdogan. After being traded to Portland in February, he did not join the Trail Blazers for their March 1 game at Toronto. The Raptors jumped out to a 10-0 lead as the Celtics missed their first five shots of the game, leading to a Boston timeout with 10:03 left in the opening quarter. After the stoppage, the Celtics outscored Toronto 28-9 to lead 28-19 after one. They hit us early but I thought we recovered well, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Brown made all five of his field goal attempts in the third, including three from long range, and scored 16 points. Boston led 88-69 through three quarters. TIP-INS Celtics: G Marcus Smart (eye infection) traveled to Toronto but was not active. Smart has missed the past seven games.  F Grant Williams dislocated his right index finger in the second quarter but returned before halftime.  F Jayson Tatum shot 1 for 10 in the first half. He finished 5 for 18 and scored 11 points.  Boston scored 11 points off seven Toronto turnovers in the first. Raptors: Toronto made a season-worst seven 3-pointers in a Dec. 9 win at Chicago.  Torontos only previous Christmas Day game was a 102-94 loss at New York in 2001. HOME SWEET HOME The road team won a Boston-Toronto game for the first time in 13 meetings. TAKE A CHANCE Boston outscored Toronto 24-4 in second-chance points. HOT SHOTS The Celtics shot 46 for 92 (50%). Boston is 8-0 this season when shooting 50% or better.","401161097"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid was unyielding under the basket, arms extended sky high as Giannis Antetokounmpo tried to plow through the All-Star center for a bucket. Embiid absorbed the contact and slapped the ball out of Antetokounmpo's hands, one of a bountiful of disruptive plays triggered by the big man. Embiid used a national showcase to play like an MVP, and the Sixers pushed around a Bucks team that had the best record in the NBA. ""A lot of people have kind of forgotten who I am,"" Embiid said. ""When I'm needed, I'm going to show up."" Embiid had 31 points and 11 rebounds in Philadelphia's first home Christmas game in 31 years, and the 3-point happy 76ers beat Milwaukee 121-109 on Wednesday. Tobias Harris sank five 3s, Josh Richardson and Furkan Korkmaz each had four and even Embiid hit three as part of Philly's franchise record-tying 21 3s (on 44 attempts) in its most complete game of the season. ""I think this team is designed for the playoffs,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""I believe the road we have traveled so far has been a little bit erratic, at times. But I think the landing spot is exciting."" Harris and Al Horford hit 3s over the final 90 seconds to push back a late Bucks run, and the Sixers improved to 16-2 at home. There was a charged atmosphere for the anticipated matchup featuring Embiid and Ben Simmons taking on Khris Middleton and Antetokounmpo. Fans dressed as elves, wore ugly sweaters and held signs that said all they wanted for Christmas was a Sixers win. They got it, with Embiid bullying the reigning MVP in Antetokounmpo on the way to the Sixers' biggest halftime lead (21 points) against the Bucks under coach Mike Budenholzer. ""It was just one of those nights,"" Budenholzer said. Embiid scored 23 points and was troublesome defensively, holding Antetokounmpo to 4-for-14 shooting in the half. The Sixers hit 11 3s in the half and made the NBA-best Bucks (27-5) look like anything but Eastern Conference contenders. Brown said before the game the Bucks were ""NBA royalty."" They have a ways to go before they're crowned tops in the East. With fans chanting ""Trust the Process!"" on Embiid free throws, the star center was worthy of the holiday highlight video. ""I reminded our team, people in America have more appreciation for this day in the NBA,"" Brown said. ""We're grateful for the opportunity."" The Sixers aced their test against the NBA's best. ""I'm not going to overvalue one game,"" 76ers general manager Elton Brand said, ""but it's a good barometer."" It wasn't just Embiid that flustered the Bucks. Korkmaz was knocked on his rear and buried Philly's 16th 3 of the game late in the third for a 93-67 lead that had the crowd going wild. Korkmaz's shot capped a string of 3s on five straight Sixers baskets. Mike Scott, the reserve better known for his man-of-the-people popup appearances, became the seventh Sixer to hit a 3 for a 98-70 lead. The 76ers led 100-73 through three. Middleton scored 31 points and Antetokounmpo had 18 points and 14 rebounds. Antetokounmpo got flustered over a perceived missed call on an eye poke and was whistled for a technical in the fourth. Antetokounmpo, who was 8 for 27 from the floor, 0 for 7 3s, said he briefly suffered blurred vision. ""We had to go through this today. We had to go down 30,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We had to have our character tested today because the only way you get better is when you face adversity. Our team is going to be better."" Brand held a state-of-the-franchise press conference before the game and preached chemistry and continuity would eventually get the Sixers among the best in the East, a conference many pundits picked them to win. ""We are going to get there,"" Brand said. ""Home-court advantage is important but having Joel healthy in the playoff in May, June, that is important to us. We could still grow into a team that could be a No. 1 seed."" For a game, the 76ers sure played like one. TIP-INS Bucks: The Bucks trailed by 29 and held only an early three-point lead. 76ers: Embiid had his seventh game this season with 30 points and 10 rebounds. He scored 20 points before halftime for the second time this season. ... Simmons had 15 points and 14 assists. ..

The former Wildcats star was named Final Four Most Outstanding Player in the '18 title run. ""There's two of them things. That's tough,"" he said.

"SAN FRANCISCO -- Damion Lee made a statement on a rare big stage this season for injury-ravaged Golden State. Lee had 22 points and a career-high 15 rebounds, Draymond Green scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half and the Warriors beat the Houston Rockets 116-104 on Wednesday. ""I'm thankful that we got the win, but there's still things that I feel I have to get better at day in and day out to fully solidify myself as an NBA player and not a two-way,"" Lee said. D'Angelo Russell added 20 points and Glenn Robinson III had 18 to help the Warriors win their third straight and end the Rockets' four-game winning streak. Golden State improved to 8-24. ""We're probably not going to play a bigger game than this all year,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""A national TV game against the Rockets. This game meant a lot to us."" Russell Westbrook had 30 points and 12 rebounds for Houston. James Harden had 24 points and 11 assists and Danuel House Jr. had 18 points. ""We had a lot of great opportunities that we just didn't convert,"" Harden said. ""It's pretty simple."" Westbrook had his ninth consecutive game of at least 20 points, the longest by any Rockets player other than Harden since Tracy McGrady did it in 10 straight games in 2007. ""For whatever reason we just didn't get it done,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It's too bad we didn't play with the spirit and energy we usually have."" Green also had 11 rebounds. He gave the Warriors the lead for good with just under five minutes left in the third quarter on a driving layup. ""It's been a really trying season for us,"" Green said. ""To come out Christmas Day and get a win against a very good basketball team feels good."" Ky Bowman hit a driving layup at the buzzer to give the Warriors an 92-87 edge heading into the final quarter. ""This felt like an opportunity for us and the guys seized it,"" Kerr said. ""I think the fans see how hard our guys are playing. Everybody is feeling great on Christmas Day to get that win."" After falling behind by eight points midway through the first quarter, the Rockets outscored Golden State 48-17 over the next 13 minutes to open a 53-40 advantage. Russell hit a short jumper in the final minute of the second and the Warriors drew to 68-64 by halftime. ""We were up by 13 in the first half and for some reason we decided to start fouling them and putting them on the line and that cost us,"" D'Antoni said. ""Defensively we gave up 64 points in the first half and that's not good enough."" CHRISTMASTIME IN THE CITY Kerr said playing on Christmas ""is definitely a special feeling. It's a great day already with a lot of good vibes in the air. It's nice to be home this year."" D'Antoni said: ""It's a special day for basketball; privileged to be able to play on these days.""

"Anthony Davis laments the Lakers allowing the Clippers to come from behind to get the win. (0:41) LOS ANGELES -- The Clippers were resilient and dominant in the second half to put away the Lakers, using the NBA's marquee Christmas game to show why the city and the Western Conference might belong to them this season. Kawhi Leonard scored 11 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter and had 12 rebounds and 5 assists to help the Clippers beat Lakers 111-106 on Wednesday night. The Clippers trailed by 12 points at halftime, by 15 in the third quarter, and by seven in the fourth quarter with 6 minutes, 39 seconds remaining, but they rallied to improve to 2-0 against the Lakers this season. ""And we didn't flinch,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Like, we just kind of hung in there. Almost felt like we were biding our time and just trying to make a run. That's something you have to have when things aren't going great for you. You just got to hang in there, and I thought we did that tonight."" Leonard set a franchise record for points on Christmas, and he became the 10th player in NBA history with at least 35 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists on Dec. 25. Montrezl Harrell had 18 points off the bench and Paul George added 17, and the Clippers are 15-2 at Staples Center. ""We have so many interchanging parts,"" Clippers guard Lou Williams said. ""We have guys that's going to have big nights. I think I had five or six points tonight, and that's just how this team is built. It's going to be different guys every night."" Kyle Kuzma led the Lakers with 25 points. LeBron James had 23 points, 10 assists and 9 rebounds, and Anthony Davis had 24 points. The Lakers have lost four consecutive games. Williams made two free throws -- after a questionable foul call against Davis for tapping the swingman after his transition layup rimmed out -- to give the Clippers a 105-103 lead with 3:29 to go. Leonard, who had a 3 to cap a 7-0 run and tie it at 101 with 5:14 remaining, then made four late free throws. ""They wanted it more,"" Davis said. ""We had a lot of mistakes down at the end of the game, mental mistakes at both ends of the floor. We fouled a lot in the fourth quarter, put them to the line. ... We gave that one away."" Los Angeles had a chance to tie in the final seconds, but video review showed James touched the ball last after Patrick Beverley knocked it away as James went up for a 3. George hit two free throws for the final margin. ""That wasn't the game right there,"" James said. ""I mean, it's a big play and you want to try to get it right, but it wasn't where the game was lost."" TIP-INS Clippers: Williams had six points and seven rebounds. ... The Clippers had a 50-42 edge in rebounds. Lakers: Kuzma had 15 points in the first quarter, making 5 of 7 shots, including 3 of 4 3s. ... The Lakers' bench outscored the Clippers' reserves 49-36. ... James played in his 14th Christmas Day game, second in NBA history to Kobe Bryant at 16. BIG RESPONSE After allowing a 14-2 run over the final 2:52 of the second quarter, the Clippers regrouped with nine different players scoring to tie it up at 86-all going into the fourth quarter. Defensively, they held the Lakers to 9-of-23 shooting in the third, including 1-of-10 from 3. ""We've done worse,"" Williams said of the struggles closing out the first half. ""We've dropped 15-point leads in three straight games before this, so I think that's just growing pains."" SANTA'S LAP There was plenty of star power sitting courtside for the highly anticipated game, including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and R&amp;B star The Weeknd. But Kevin Hart found himself closer to the action than expected when Davis missed a fallaway shot at the end of the first half and ended up on top of the comedian. James ran over from the bench and did the same, much to the amusement of Hart's kids.","401161100"
"DENVER --  Brandon Ingram had no clue how many 3-pointers he'd made until a voice from across the locker room informed him. Seven. An assist to injured rookie Zion Williamson for providing the pertinent information. Ingram scored 31 points, including a career-high in 3-pointers, and the New Orleans Pelicans surprised Denver 112-100 on Wednesday night to halt the Nuggets' seven-game winning streak. Rarely has Ingram's shot felt as pure as it did -- from deep anyway. ""It's been college and high school,"" Ingram said of his long-range accuracy. ""They (teammates) found me when I was open. I had the confidence to knock it down."" The 9-23 Pelicans are now 2-0 against the Nuggets this season. They spoiled the festive mood at the Pepsi Center as the Nuggets played at home on Christmas for the first time in 25 years. ""The character of our guys showed that although our record is what it is, we continue to play,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We will continue to play. I don't see any quit in these guys or anything like that. There's no fragmentation or anything like that."" New Orleans sprang the upset despite committing 19 turnovers that led to 27 points. The Pelicans pulled away late courtesy of the long-range shooting of Lonzo Ball and Ingram. They also out-rebounded the Nuggets, which included 14 offensive boards. Derrick Favors was a force in grabbing 13 rebounds and dishing out a career-best eight assists to go with eight points. ""He was huge,"" said Jrue Holiday, who had 20 points, six steals and eight assists. ""We ask him to do a lot, but he's doing it."" New Orleans finished a four-game trip with a 3-1 mark, which includes consecutive wins for the first time in a month. This was the first time the Nuggets have hosted on the holiday since 1994 when they beat Seattle 105-96 in front of a sold-out crowd at McNichols Arena. The fans at Pepsi Center didn't leave in a particularly merry mood. Then again, in the five Christmas games Wednesday, the home teams went 2-3. ""We got bullied on the boards. They dominated us with their physicality,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We don't have a match-up for Ingram. So I've got to do a better job helping our guys out."" Neither team led by more than eight points until Ball's 3-pointer with 4:07 remaining made it 104-95. That all but sealed the win. Nikola Jokic finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for Denver, while Jerami Grant had 17. The Pelicans also knocked off the Nuggets 122-107 on Halloween. ""They did the same stuff they did the first time we played them,"" Gary Harris said. ""We didn't bring the fight today."" This looked like an entertaining matchup when the NBA schedules were released. But that was before Williamson had surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee on Oct. 21. On Wednesday, Williamson sat on the bench dressed in a dark suit. The Pelicans have struggled without Williamson, while the Nuggets (21-9) have soared to one of the top marks in the West. Williamson did provide some valuable information to Ingram, who knew he made a few 3-pointers but didn't know the total. ""That,"" Ingram said, ""was when I found out."" TIP-INS Pelicans: G Josh Hart finished with 16 points. ... The Pelicans were 12 of 12 from the free-throw line. Nuggets: Former Nuggets standout and Denver native Chauncey Billups was part of the broadcast team for the game. ... Broncos pass rusher Von Miller was in attendance. REDICK'S SURGE JJ Redick scored 13 of his 15 points in the second quarter, including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from near half-court to give the Pelicans a 58-55 lead. Redick now has 1,799 career 3-pointers and moved past Klay Thompson for 16th place on the all-time list. The next name on the list is Kobe Bryant, who finished with 1,827. EARLY PRESENT On Christmas Eve, Malone agreed to a contract extension that runs through the 2022-23 season. He's fourth in franchise history in wins among head coaches. ""The players in there, my coaches, are a big, big part of that,"" Malone said of having his contract extended. ZION UPDATE Asked about Williamson before the game, Gentry said: ""He is making progress. He is in rehab. He is doing everything that he's supposed to do and he's moving forward toward playing.""","401161101"
"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons didn't want to take a six-game losing streak into their longest road trip of the season. Turns out, Pistons coach Dwane Casey and his banged-up squad were facing one of the few NBA teams dealing with even more injuries ahead of hitting the road. Blake Griffin had 14 points and a season-high 11 rebounds and Detroit ended a five-game losing streak with a 132-102 rout of the Washington Wizards 132-102 on Thursday night. ""We did a lot of good things, and now we've got to carry that on the road,"" Casey said. ""We knew we had a wounded team over there and I thought our ball movement was as good as it has been all season."" The Pistons were missing Reggie Jackson (back) and Luke Kennard (knee), while Griffin, Bruce Brown and Derrick Rose played through injuries. ""I thought we did all the little things right,"" Griffin said. ""We obviously weren't in a good spot with a five-game losing streak, but we just focused on tonight and making sure we played our game."" John Wall, Davis Bertans, Isaiah Thomas, Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura sat out for Washington. ""We didn't play well and they have a great game,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""They came back healthy and their bigs were a handful. We paid so much attention to (Griffin and Andre Drummond) that their guards took us out of a good offensive rhythm."" Detroit, which had already lost twice to the Wizards, got 14 points and 10 rebounds from Andre Drummond. Pistons coach Dwane Casey was able to use the lopsided margin to rest his key players, including sitting Griffin for the fourth quarter. Christian Wood finished with 22 points and Tim Frazier scored 18 for Detroit, which had eight players in double figures. The Pistons took 48 3-pointers, tying the franchise record set on Dec. 19, 2018, in a 129-123 overtime win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Frazier hit five of six attempts. ""Timmy has been in the league for five or six years, so he's got experience and he knows what is going on,"" Casey said. ""He was shooting well, but he also helped with our ball movement and pace."" Anzejs Pasecniks scored a career-high 17 in his fifth NBA game to lead the Wizards. Bradley Beal had 15 points before leaving the game in the fourth quarter. ""He had some soreness in his right lower leg, so we'll see how he feels tomorrow and evaluate it from there,"" Brooks said. ""He wanted to keep playing, but we were down big and thought it was wise to let him sit out the rest of the game."" Despite a makeshift lineup, the Wizards were able to stay close early, taking advantage of Detroit's defensive rebounding issues. Washington pulled down 45% of their own misses in the first quarter. But, the Pistons moved out to a 68-48 lead by halftime. The Pistons finished the game with rebounds on 67% of the Wizards' missed shots. That's still one of their four worst totals of the season, all of which have come in the last four games, but it was a significant improvement on the 59% they recorded in Monday's loss to the Chicago Bulls. ""Our biggest adjustment was getting after the ball,"" Casey said. ""It was a concern before the game and it was still a concern during the game. Everybody's got to do a better job, starting with the old-fashioned box out. We did a better job in the second half, but it is still an issue."" The Pistons have struggled all season in the third quarter. They were able to keep the momentum going against the Wizards, pushing their lead to 29 points, 89-60, midway through the period. Detroit led by as many as 34 points in the fourth quarter. ""We've got to go out there and play hard the whole game, and we didn't go hard and we weren't aggressive,"" Wizards guard Jordan McRae said. ""Against a team with big guys like Drummond and Griffin, you have to be physical. I don't think we were."" TIP INS Wizards: Washington was playing in Detroit on the day after Christmas for the second year in a row. In 2018, Beal and Wall combined for 42 points in a 106-95 loss. Markieff Morris had 12 points for the Wizards in that game and scored four for Detroit this year. Pistons: The team announced Thursday that Kennard will miss at least two weeks with knee soreness. Kennard had missed two of Detroit's last three games in an attempt to remedy the problem. WELCOME TO THE LEAGUE Louis King made his NBA debut for Detroit in the fourth quarter, finishing with two points and a rebound in four minutes. DEFENSIVE STRUGGLES Washington allowed at least 110 points for the 24th straight game, one short of the longest season-season streak since the 1990-91 Denver Nuggets did it in 28 straight games. The New Orleans Pelicans finished last season with a 25-game streak, while the 1990-91 Nuggets started a 24-game streak one game after breaking the 28-game run.","401161102"
"NEW YORK --  A local rivalry was supposed to go national Thursday, with the Knicks and Nets scheduled to play on TNT before the game was recently replaced. That turned out to be a wise decision because it was anything but must-see TV. Julius Randle had 33 points and eight rebounds, and New York forced Brooklyn into the worst shooting performance in the NBA this season in a 94-82 victory. Brooklyn finished 21 of 78 (26.9%) from the field. Chicago had the previous worst shooting game this season when it hit 29.9% against Toronto exactly two months earlier. ""They just outplayed us. Plain and simple,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""You could sit there and write and talk about missed shots -- we did miss lots of open shots -- but give them the credit. They simply were the better team tonight."" Marcus Morris added 22 points and eight rebounds for the Knicks, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Elfrid Payton scored 13 points as New York won for the first time in three meetings with Brooklyn this season. ""We were just sharp. To hold that team to 82 points, 14 points in the paint, is just really, really sharp,"" Randle said. ""We grinded the whole way, played a complete basketball game and we got the win."" The Nets' eight 2-point field goals were the fewest in an NBA game since 1950, when the Lakers and Pistons each made four shots from the field in a game with a final score of 19-18, according to Elias Sports. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 25 points but was only 5 for 15 for the Nets, who were held to their lowest point total of the season. ""For us, the target was to keep them under 100. We also shot 27 percent,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Maybe too much eggnog?"" The game even lacked the usual energy of a matchup between the city rivals, when there's almost always noise because both teams have plenty of fans in the building. This time, there were simply too many long spells when there was nothing to cheer from the sellout crowd of 17,732. The Nets hadn't played since Saturday and couldn't shake off their holiday rust. Randle scored 12 points in the first quarter, when his five baskets were as many as the Nets. Brooklyn shot 21% for the period and the Knicks led 24-15. That wasn't the Nets' only bad quarter. After they had cut it to 46-41 at halftime, they came out for the third and took more than eight minutes to make a basket. That allowed the Knicks to break it open with an 18-4 burst that extended an eight-point lead to 71-49 on Payton's layup. ""It is a tough task when you shoot like 25 percent,"" Nets center Jarrett Allen said. ""That makes playing defense much harder and running up and down the court harder."" Payton said he could sense the frustration in the Nets' body language during that third quarter, when the Knicks outscored them 33-20. ""You could feel it, you could see it,"" he said. ""And credit to us that we made some plays to kind of like seal the game."" Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot finally gave the Nets their first basket with a 3-pointer with 3:52 to play in the period, and he hit another later in the quarter, finishing with half of Brooklyn's baskets in the period as it went 4 for 12. TIP-INS Knicks: F Morris and C Taj Gibson were back in the starting lineup after missing the loss to Washington on Monday. Morris had a sore left Achilles tendon and Gibson was ill. G Dennis Smith Jr. was out with a strained left oblique. ... Mitchell Robinson had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Nets: Atkinson reported no change for Kyrie Irving, who missed his 19th straight game with a right shoulder injury. He said the All-Star point guard continues to work out on the court but they haven't gotten to the point where they can add contact, which would be the next step. He added that the Nets aren't at the point where they're thinking Irving will need surgery on the shoulder. ... Among the ugly nights for the Nets: Taurean Prince was 1 for 10, Garrett Temple 2 for 10 and Joe Harris 3 for 12. CARIS CLOSE Starting Nets guard Caris LeVert is moving closer to returning from right thumb surgery in November. Atkinson said LeVert just needs a little more work involving contact before he is ready to rejoin the lineup. He has missed the last 21 games. ""He did a lot of contact today,"" Atkinson said. ""Probably need a couple more of those sessions until he and our medical team, performance team feels like he's ready to go, but obviously getting much closer."" STILL ON TOP The Knicks' victory allowed them to keep a slim lead in the all-time series. The Nets would have evened it at 99 wins apiece with a victory. They had won the last four meetings.","401161103"

Jonas Valanciunas scored 21 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 20 and the Grizzlies held onto the lead this time in a 110-97 victory over the Thunder. Tyus Jones added 15 points off the bench on 6-of-7 shooting for Memphis, which blew a 24-point third-quarter lead during its last visit to Oklahoma City on Dec. 18 and lost 126-122. That started a stretch in which the Grizzles dropped three out of four games. ""Last time was disappointing, because we had a big lead and we lost it,"" Jackson said. ""We weren't able to respond. This time we made sure we responded the right way. We got a big lead again . then made sure we took care of the ball and made the right plays. ""That one stung before, so we definitely owed them one. I'm glad we got it done."" Chris Paul had 23 points and 11 assists, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 and Dennis Schroder added 20 points for Oklahoma City, which had a four-game winning streak snapped. The Thunder had beaten Memphis nine straight times at Chesapeake Energy Arena, a streak that dated to Nov. 14, 2012. ""They were rebounding on us and they were just making timely shots,"" Paul said. ""They made the floaters, the mid-range, the 3s. Honestly, we can look and see what we need to do better, but I think give them credit, too -- they played an all-around great game."" The burly Valanciunas went 9 of 11 from the field and fueled an 8-0 run early in the fourth quarter that essentially put the game away. Memphis shot 55% from the field and outrebounded the Thunder 50-34. Memphis didn't trail after the first quarter. The Grizzlies led by nine in the first and were up 49-47 at halftime. They extended their advantage to double digits for the first time at 79-67 on a 3-pointer by Jones with 2:53 left in the third and pushed their lead to 20 with 9:10 left after six straight points by Valanciunas. Oklahoma City pulled to 106-97 with 2:15 to go, but Schroder missed an open 3 on the Thunder's next possession and Valanciunas dunked at the other end with 1:25 remaining. ""We've had some tough endings the last (few games), but we don't dwell,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We move forward. Our guys are continuing to get better. The competitiveness is there every single night. But when you get that production, that competitive fire from all 11 guys, the unselfishness that we're talking about, the critical learning opportunities that we've had, in the fourth quarter to close out a win is huge for us."" Brandon Clarke scored 13 points for Memphis, going 5 of 6 from the floor. Steven Adams had 16 points for the Thunder.

"DALLAS -- Luka Doncic barely missed a step and added a little Magic on his return to the Dallas lineup on Thursday night. He had missed the previous four games because of a sprained right ankle. Doncic scored a game-high 24 points as the Mavericks beat the San Antonio Spurs 102-98. He finished with 10 rebounds and eight assists and barely missed adding to his NBA-leading total of eight triple doubles. He last had played on Dec. 14 against Miami. Against San Antonio, Doncic played 32:39, about half a minute more than his season average. ""I'm not going to lie,"" Doncic said. ""I was pretty tired."" Tired or not, he impressed Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ""I hate to say this, he's not Magic Johnson but it's Magic Johnson-like in the sense that he sees the floor in that same way. He's got a real intuitive sense and you can't teach that. He's just got it and he's great at it. I'm not trying to put the Magic Johnson pressure on him, he's not ready for that yet but he's doing a hell of a job."" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said that Doncic could have been even better. ""He had a few challenges early with rhythm and getting his legs under him. He got into a great flow as the game went on."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 17 points, Porzingis and Dorian Finney-Smith had 13 each, and Delon Wright added 12 off the bench for Dallas. Dwight Powell's 11 points all came in the first half.

The Mavericks led 79-74 after three quarters, and all but put the game away by making 7 of 9 3-point shots to start the fourth quarter. ""They had their little barrage there when they made six in a row, and that was the game,"" Popovich said. Doncic didn't make any of the seven in that barrage, but his presence was felt even then. ""He draws so much attention that he gets everybody else open,"" Porzingis said. ""We get good looks. It's up to the rest of us to knock down the shots or make the next play. ""It was good to have him back."" Doncic said his ankle was good. ""I'm going to keep icing it. I'm young. I just want to play. I don't want to miss no games."" The Mavericks (20-10) pulled within half a game of idle first-place Houston in the Southwest Division. Dallas scored the first eight points, with 3-point shots by Finney-Smith and Hardaway bracketing Doncic's first basket 1:23 into the game from short range. TIP-INS Spurs: They made only one of six 3-point attempts (17 percent) in the first quarter. On a positive note, San Antonio held Dallas to 2 for 10 (20 percent) during that time.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  As he watched Buddy Hield's last-second 3-point attempt clang off the back of the rim at the end of double overtime, Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins breathed a sigh of relief that was nearly a month in the making. For the first time in December, the Timberwolves won a game. ""All you could do was look and watch,"" Wiggins said. ""I was looking at the shot and it missed. Thank God."" Wiggins scored the first basket of the second overtime and then fed Robert Covington for another score, and Minnesota ended its 11-game losing streak by beating the Sacramento Kings 105-104 on Thursday night. Minnesota hadn't won since Nov. 27 before limiting Sacramento to 11 points in the fourth quarter and then outlasting the Kings in two overtimes. The Wolves did it without Karl-Anthony Towns, who missed his fifth straight game with a left knee sprain. ""We did a lot of great things tonight,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Our offense was not pretty tonight but we found ways. That locker room deserves to feel good."" Wiggins got the Wolves going in the second OT with a short jumper that started a 6-0 run. After Jeff Teague made a floater, Wiggins passed to Covington for a layup. Gorgui Dieng's dunk with 3:11 left put Minnesota up 105-99. Hield scored five straight points for Sacramento to close the gap, but the Wolves held on after Hield missed the potential game-winner. ""Winning in double overtime, winning in regulation, either way I would have took it,"" Minnesota's Treveon Graham said. Wiggins finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Dieng had 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Covington scored 19 for the Timberwolves. Richaun Holmes had 20 points and a career-high 18 rebounds for the Kings, who have their own injury concerns. De'Aaron Fox left two minutes into the first quarter with back spasms. Sacramento's point guard missed 17 games this season with an ankle injury sustained in practice. Marvin Bagley III limped off the court in the third quarter and was wearing a walking boot on his left foot after the game. Bagley had also recently returned after missing 22 games because of a broken right thumb sustained in the season opener. ""Give Minnesota credit. They knocked down some big shots when they had to and we didn't,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""We have to keep scrapping and fighting. We have to be better."" Both teams turned chances to win in the first overtime into turnovers. In the final 0.5 seconds alone, Teague threw away an inbounds pass and Bogdan Bogdanovic missed the rim on a 3-point try.

Wiggins had an emphatic one-hand dunk in the first quarter but clanged another attempt off the rim in the second. Kings: Fox had two points and two assists before leaving. ... Bagley, who had 18 points, was called for a technical after picking up his fourth foul. QUOTABLE ""There are some trust issues going on, I guess. Guys are now starting not to believe in players.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Joe Ingles was hot early and Donovan Mitchell had it going in the second half. But it took three big plays in the final three minutes by Rudy Gobert for the Utah Jazz to turn back the Portland Trail Blazers. Mitchell scored 28 of his 35 points in the second half to power the Jazz to a 121-115 win over the Trail Blazers on Thursday night, but it wouldn't have been possible without a few Gobert gems that won't jump out of a box score. ""Those hustle plays by Rudy really sealed the game. You can say what you want about my scoring, or Joe, but at the end of the day it came down to Rudy making two big plays. That's why he is who he is and that's why we rely on him,"" Mitchell said. Clinging to a two-point lead, Gobert used all of his 7-foot-9 wingspan to dive after a ball that was passing over the baseline and flick it to Bojan Bogdanovic for a 3-pointer from the corner with 1:45 to play. ""That was as good a play, as impactful a play as anybody's made all year,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Gobert, who had 16 points and 15 rebounds, forced Carmelo Anthony into an air ball with 22.4 seconds remaining and blocked Damon Lillard's driving shot with 5.2 seconds left to quell the Trail Blazers' furious fourth-quarter rally. ""Those two guys (Lillard and McCollum) -- when they get going, they're not easy to stop. We knew we were going to need those key stops to win the game,"" Gobert said. Lillard scored 34 points, including a pair of 30-foot contested 3-pointers in the final minutes, and CJ McCollum tallied 17 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter for the Blazers (14-18), who have dropped two straight after winning four in a row. McCollum, who struggled with his accuracy all night, finally made a jumper to cap a 10-0 Portland spurt to draw within 100-93 with 7:23 to play. ""We came out of the huddle saying, `No worries ... keep competing and try and put pressure on them and steal the game.' I thought we did that. We just came up short,"" Lillard said. Gobert made a basket and a free throw, but McCollum scored five more points in a 7-0 run to trim the lead to 103-102. But Mitchell seemed to have an answer for every improbable Blazer shot down the stretch. The Jazz (19-12), who have won six of the last seven games, took their largest lead at 86-63 after Gobert's push shot in the lane. Lillard scored eight straight points but Mitchell wouldn't let Lillard go on one of his epic runs without a response. ""(Mitchell) was poised. I think he made the right play. Didn't settle for jump shots. He attacked the rim, drew some fouls, and won us the game on that end,"" Gobert said. CLARKSON DEBUTS Cleveland traded Jordan Clarkson to the Jazz for guard Dante Exum and two future second-round draft picks on Tuesday. Hours after passing his physical, Clarkson checked in with 4:05 left in first quarter and made a pull-up jumper off the dribble, a minute later. That's not a shot Jazz fans have seen Exum take. He got nine attempts in his 11-minute stint and scored 9 points but missed all three of shots in the second half. ""He has a hunger about him,"" Snyder said. Exum, the No. 5 overall pick in 2014, didn't play in his last six games. KING OF THE RIM PROTECTORS On Saturday, Hassan Whiteside proclaimed he was the best rim protector in the league and ""it wasn't even close."" Of course, two-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert believes otherwise even though Whiteside leads the league in blocks with 78. ""Rudy takes a lot of pride in being able to defend in a lot of different ways,"" Snyder said. The Jazz made 17 of 22 shots at the rim and 13 of 19 on other shots in the lane. Portland was outscored by 28 points in Whiteside's 22 minutes on the court. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard, who missed all 10 3-point attempts in Monday's loss to New Orleans, made three 3s by halftime and had 17 points. He made seven 3s by the end of the game... Portland outscored Utah 26-7 in the first 7:20 of the fourth quarter. ... Both Anthony and Royce O'Neal committed in-bound fouls in the final 18 seconds resulting in a free throw and the ball. Jazz: Ingles was so hot to start the game, he let the Trail Blazers know it and was hit with a taunting technical. ... Mike Conley missed five games with a sore hamstring. He then re-injured it in his first game back and has missed four more games. ... The Jazz waived Jeff Green on Tuesday and signed Rayjon Tucker from the Milwaukee Bucks' G-League affiliate. Tucker didn't play Thursday.","401161107"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics have quite a young pair of stars developing in Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. Brown matched his career high with 34 points, Tatum had 24 of his 30 points in the opening half and the Celtics cruised to their fifth straight victory, 129-117 over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. They both have been able to do a lot and have consistently grown and gotten better, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. But I dont think we saw anything today that we havent seen out of both those guys in the last couple weeks, the last couple months. Theyve been playing well, and they obviously are playing confidently and feel good. Brown posted the first consecutive 30-point games of his career. He had 30 in a Christmas Day win at Toronto. He also scored 34 points in a playoff loss at Milwaukee on April 22, 2018. I think that the both of us together, its hard to scheme and stop us both, Brown said. We just come out and try to be aggressive. Days like today they couldnt stop either of us. Enes Kanter added 14 points and Kemba Walker had 13 for Boston, which improved to 13-1 at home. Kevin Love equaled his season high with 30 points and had seven rebounds for the Cavaliers, who had won their last three games and four of six. Collin Sexton added 21 points. Every time I watch Boston, Im very envious of what they have out there, and remind myself they were much like us five years ago, Cleveland coach John Beilein said. They just have so many, four guys out there that are explosive, can score at any time. The Celtics only trailed in the opening minutes and led 62-47 at halftime. Boston closed the first quarter by scoring the final seven points, taking a 33-22 lead into the break after Tatums 3-pointer with 4.9 seconds left. The Celtics then had a 10-0 spree midway through the second, turning a 12-point lead to 48-26 on Tatums step-back 3 from the right wing. Yeah, you see progression from both of those guys, and theyre going to continue to get better because theyre so young and hungry to get better, Love said of Bostons emerging pair. After intermission, Boston maintained a double-digit lead for the entire third quarter, building it to 84-62 on Kanters layup midway in before Love helped the Cavs slice it to 92-81 after three. Cleveland finally got its deficit into single digits early in the fourth, but Boston put it away when Brown nailed consecutive 3s from the left wing 25 seconds apart that made it 108-90 with just over seven minutes to play. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Guard Dante Exum, acquired with two second round-picks from Utah for guard Jordan Clarkson, made his debut with Cleveland. He wore No. 1 and scored nine points in 15 minutes. Obviously trying to learn a new system in two days is tough, he said.  Sexton has scored at least 20 points in five of the last seven games.  Cleveland came in averaging 111.9 points per game in its last seven. Celtics: Marcus Smart missed his eighth straight game with an eye infection. Stevens said before the game that Smart hasnt been ruled out for Saturday yet.  Gordon Hayward tied his career high with 39 points in Cleveland on Nov. 5. On Friday, he had seven points and eight assists in his second game back after missing three with a sore left foot. STRONG START Tatum went 9 of 13 from the floor and connected on 4 of 6 from 3-point range in the opening half. TRY AGAIN The Celtics improved to 3-0 against the Cavaliers this season. The teams final regular-season meeting is March 4 in Cleveland.","401161108"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  After 15 seasons in the NBA, Chris Paul said there's nothing that beats playing in the fourth quarter. After making some clutch plays in it Friday, he had enough left to come up big in overtime. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 27 points, Dennis Schroder added 24 off the bench and Paul had 10 of his 16 points after the third quarter as the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Charlotte Hornets 104-102 for their fifth win in the last six games. ""I love it man,"" Paul said. ""I kept telling Shai, 'All right, it's the fourth quarter and we will turn it on.' And that's the thing that gets your blood flowing, those fourth-quarter situations."" Paul didn't put up gaudy numbers in his nearly 35 minutes of action, finishing just 6 of 20 from the field. But he contributed seven rebounds, six assists and gave the Thunder the floor general and playmaker they needed down the stretch after his team let a 16-point lead slip away in the fourth quarter. ""He was great,"" said Thunder coach Billy Donovan. ""He made obviously some big shots and some big plays. ... He made some key shots coming down the stretch."" Paul, a North Carolina native who was playing in front of his father, brother and grandparents who were sitting courtside, hit two jumpers in the final 1:06 of regulation. Then he knocked down a pull-up jumper in overtime to give the Thunder a five-point lead. He also had three rebounds in the extra period. Said Hornets coach James Borrego: ""Chris Paul is a handful -- he's still a handful."" Terry Rozier scored 26 points and Devonte Graham had 15 points and 13 assists for the Hornets, who finished 7 of 39 from 3-point range after missing their first 18 attempts from beyond the arc. Steven Adams tipped in a miss by Paul to give the Thunder a 103-99 lead in the extra period, but Graham answered with a quick 3 from the top of the key. The Hornets fouled Gilgeous-Alexander, who made one of two free throws with 8.4 seconds left, giving Charlotte a chance to win or send the game into a second overtime. But Charlotte's inbounds play went awry as Graham slipped trying to get the ball. P.J. Washington improvised and drove to the basket and was fouled with 1.9 seconds left. But Washington missed the first free throw badly to the right and was forced to try to miss the second. Washington's second shot hit the front rim, but the Hornets were unable to corral the rebound and get a shot off as time expired. ""I think we came out really sluggish,"" Washington said. ""Missing shots, missing assignments on defense, just watching ball, watching the offense. We could have done a better job of that coming in, so we just have to get better from the start of the games and just have to maintain that for the whole game."" The Thunder got off to a slow start, failing to score until nearly five minutes into the game after missing their first eight shots from the field and both free throw attempts. But Oklahoma City still managed to build a 16-point lead in the first half largely because the Hornets struggled from long distance. TIP-INS Thunder: Adams had 14 points and 12 rebounds. ... Bench outscored the Hornets' 47-26. Oklahoma City's bench has outscored its opponent's reserves in 24 of 31 games this season. Hornets: Washington returned to the starting lineup after missing the last five games with a fractured finger on his right hand. ... Graham has increased his scoring output by 14.6 points over last season. No one else in the league is averaging more than an 8.4-point improvement. ODD ENDING TO REGULATION Overtime started in an odd way with the Thunder getting a free throw after Rozier was assessed a technical foul for throwing the ball into the crowd at the end of regulation. Donovan said he'd never seen a technical free throw attempt before the start of an overtime period. Rozier called it a ""silly technical"" on his part. GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER DOING MORE Gilgeous-Alexander led Oklahoma City in scoring again, but Donovan was most impressed with his post defense late in the game when the Thunder went to four guards. He had two steals that helped change the momentum in the final three minutes of regulation. ""That was really critical because they had a lead at that point and time and those couple steals kind of got us back in control and we got some momentum,"" Donovan said. ""It was two consecutive steals on two post-ups, so those plays were big when we were small.""","401161109"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic could've had a smoother finish, though they couldn't complain about their performance the rest of the night. Evan Fournier scored 20 points and the Magic survived a collapse from the free throw line in the final minute to squeeze out a 98-97 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday. ""The end wasn't great, but we can clean that up,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""That's a good win against a good team."" Aaron Gordon had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 12 rebounds for Orlando, which won its second straight. ""It felt like Magic basketball tonight as far as the defense and preparation,"" Fournier said. ""They are one of the top teams in the East and we were ready for a fight. We need to be like that every night."" Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris each had 24 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Embiid missed a desperation 30-footer at the buzzer that could have won it. Orlando led 93-83 after Gordon's dunk with 1:49 left in the game, but it was far from over. The Magic were 5 of 11 from the free throw line in the final 1:30. That included four misses in the final 30 seconds. Philadelphia's last four field goals were 3-pointers that gave the visitor's a chance at winning. Embiid hit the last of them with 5.1 seconds to play that cut the Sixers' deficit to 98-97. Ben Simmons then stole the inbounds pass at the Magic end of the court and gave it to Embiid, who launched his desperation shot as the buzzer sounded. It was short and left and Orlando survived. ""If I'm open I'm going to shoot it,"" Embiid said of his late-game offensive burst. ""That's the mentality you have to have. I didn't make the last one so it doesn't matter."" The game was a defensive struggle from start to finish. Most possessions were a battle to find an opening somewhere before the 24-point shot clock expired. Philadelphia had a 47-46 lead at halftime and pushed it to 62-54 early in the second half with the first offensive burst of the game. Embiid had seven points and Harris five as the Sixers took advantage of five Magic turnovers in a three-minute stretch to establish their biggest lead of the game. Orlando returned the favor, running off nine straight points off Sixers miscues. Vucevic's layup put Orlando up 63-62 and Orlando nursed that the rest of the quarter, taking a 71-68 lead into the fourth. ""It was a playoff-type movement as far as the physical side of it and I thought we responded with a D-minus,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""It was a statement thing, a physical thing and we responded poorly."" Both teams spent the first half searching unsuccessfully for a hot hand. Philadelphia's 39-34 lead in the middle of the second quarter was the biggest either team could muster before halftime. There were 13 lead changes and eight ties as the defenses got the best of the action. TIP-INS 76ERS: Philadelphia, which scored 30-plus points in 10 of its previous 12 quarters, had a high of 29 against the Magic. . Simmons has 38 assists in his last three games. . The Sixers had a chance to tie the game with 24 seconds left, but Simmons turned the ball over on an inbounds play. MAGIC: C Mo Bamba (ankle) and G Michael Carter-Williams (shoulder) did not play.","401161110"
"ATLANTA --  Khris Middleton scored 23 points, Ersan Ilyasova had season highs of 18 points and 17 rebounds and the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks overcame Giannis Antetokunmpo's absence to beat the Atlanta Hawks 112-86 on Friday night. Antetokunmpo, the league MVP last season and second-leading scorer this season, sat out because of back soreness.  He watched from the bench as his teammates helped Milwaukee improve to 28-5 overall and 13-3 on the road. The Hawks lost their ninth straight to drop to a league-worst 6-26. They lost guard Trae Young, the NBA's fourth-leading scorer, to a right ankle sprain late in the second quarter. He had to be helped off the floor  and was ruled out for the rest of the game. Brook Lopez had 19 points for Milwaukee to match his season high. Allen Crabbe led the Hawks with 20 points in a reserve role. Starting forward John Collins, Atlanta's second-leading scorer, finished with nine points and missed 10 of 14 shots from the field. Ilyasova's 3 at the 6:25 mark of the third put the Bucks up 78-46. With his team trailing by 30 a couple of minutes later, Atlanta's DeAndre' Bembry stole the ball and missed a dunk. The Bucks improved to 26-3 since Nov. 1 and are 2-0 without Antetokoumpo, who missed a Dec. 11 win over New Orleans with right quad tendon soreness. Middleton, Lopez and Ilyasova, who started in Antetokounmpo's spot, sat out the fourth quarter with a comfortable lead. TIP-INS Bucks: It was unclear before the game how time Antetokounmpo will miss.

"MIAMI --  Erik Spoelstra warned his team before the game that matchups between Indiana and Miami tend to get decided by a loose ball somewhere. Sure enough, he was right. Goran Dragic scored in the lane with 6.8 seconds remaining to cap a wild finish, and the Heat improved the NBA's best home record to 14-1 by defeating the Pacers 113-112 on Friday night. Dragic's shot was the third by Miami on the go-ahead possession, after Jimmy Butler and Kendrick Nunn both missed but the Heat were able to grab offensive rebounds to keep hope alive. Those were Miami's final two boards on a night where the Heat outrebounded the Pacers 56-34. ""Those last two rebounds, those plays speak for themselves,"" Dragic said. ""We're never going to give up."" Aaron Holiday had a chance to win it for Indiana, but his 10-footer -- well defended by Derrick Jones Jr. -- with about a second left bounced away. The lead changed hands five times in the final 2:21. Butler scored 20 points for Miami. Bam Adebayo had 18 points and 15 rebounds, including the offensive board that set up Dragic's shot. Nunn scored 17, Dragic had 14 and Tyler Herro scored 10. ""We knew it would be a grind,"" Spoelstra said. Duncan Robinson had 18 points, all on six 3-pointers to reach 101 for the season. He reached the century mark in 31 games, four games faster than anyone else in Heat history. Damon Jones needed 35 games in 2004-05. Aaron Holiday scored 17 for Indiana, which got 16 from TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb, 14 from Doug McDermott, 13 from Myles Turner and 11 apiece from Justin Holiday and Edmund Sumner. ""It comes down to two plays we have to execute and we didn't,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""That defensive possession where if we get a stop and we get the rebound and possibly win the game. I think they got three offensive rebounds on that possession and then we have the last possession of the game and we don't score. You have to make those plays and we didn't do that."" The Heat stretched their lead to nine points on two occasions early in the fourth quarter -- first on a 3-pointer by Dragic, the second on a 3 by Herro. And both times, Indiana answered with 3s of its own to avoid letting Miami pull away; Sumner hit the first, McDermott hit the second and then connected again with 8:44 left to trim Miami's lead to 96-93. That set up the down-to-the-wire finish, and the Pacers couldn't get the bounce. ""We'll take that shot any day,"" McDermott said. ""Aaron, we have a lot of faith in him, he's a great scorer, and that's why we want the ball in his hands."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana committed only four turnovers, tying a franchise record. ... Malcolm Brogdon tested his balky hamstring Friday morning, but was not cleared to play. ""Still a little sore,"" McMillan said. ... Turner had four fouls, all of them against Butler. ...

"SAN FRANCISCO --  With four consecutive wins, Golden State coach Steve Kerr joked that there is really no stopping the Warriors. ""You can only hope to contain us right now,"" Kerr said with a grin. That's how good things are going these days for the worst team in the Western Conference. Small winning streaks, which use to be taken for granted while Golden State was winning three NBA titles in five years, are now a rarity worth chucking over. D'Angelo Russell had 31 points and six assists, and the Warriors rallied from 10 down in the fourth quarter to beat the Phoenix Suns 106-95 on Friday night. Damion Lee added 16 points, Alec Burks scored nine of his 13 in the fourth quarter, and Draymond Green had 11 points and seven rebounds. ""I just think we've got a little momentum and our guys are feeling it,"" Kerr said. ""Just stayed with it. At this point we believe we can win down the stretch. We've definitely taken a step forward in that regard."" Two days after beating Houston on Christmas, the Warriors trailed for most of the second half against Phoenix and were down 86-76 with 7  1/2 minutes remaining. Russell started the comeback with a pair of free throws and Burks followed with a three-point play. Burks later had an assist on Willie Cauley-Stein's alley-oop dunk. Phoenix led 89-87 before Golden State went on an 8-0 run. Glenn Robinson III's putback dunk following a miss by Russell put the Warriors ahead for good 91-89. Russell shot 10 of 25 while topping 30 points for the sixth time this season. ""We're getting better as a team,"" Green said. ""A month ago we would have lost this game by 40 with the way we were playing in the first half. We were able to stick around. When you stick around the way we did, eventually shots will fall."" Devin Booker scored 34 points for Phoenix. The Suns committed 27 turnovers and have lost eight straight. ""We put ourselves in situations where we weren't playing good,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""I thought we would play with more energy and an edge. We just have to be more solid."" The Warriors, who lost to the Suns 121-110 on Oct. 30, have won 19 of 21 against Phoenix. Booker, who was limited to 11 points in a loss to Denver on Monday, had 17 in the first half against Golden State, including a one-handed dunk that put the Suns ahead 47-38. Booker later banked in a 16-footer to give Phoenix a 51-43 halftime lead. After Booker had his shot blocked from behind by Golden State's Ky Bowman, Mikal Bridges scooped up the loose ball and scored on a three-point play. Bridges added a 3-pointer that -made it 74-63.
