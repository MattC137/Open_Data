"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors slipped on shiny new rings, unfurled a championship banner, then got their title defense started with a hard-fought victory. Fred VanVleet scored a career-high 34 points, Pascal Siakam fouled out with 34 points and 18 rebounds, and the defending champion Raptors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 130-122 in overtime on Tuesday night in the NBA's season-opening game. ""Pascal and Freddy, they are the young core, they are the guys who will carry this thing on,"" Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. ""I'm so happy for those guys to go out and perform like tonight. We'll see them grow all year."" Lowry scored 22 points, including a pair of free throws that put Toronto in the lead for good, and Serge Ibaka had 13 as the Raptors won their seventh straight season opener and posted their eighth win in nine meetings with the Pelicans. ""It's very fun to be in the position that we're in where we just won it but we're kind of on the climb again,"" VanVleet said. Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday tied it at 122 by making a pair of free throws with 2:23 left in overtime. Lowry answered with his foul shots, VanVleet hit a corner 3, and Lowry also connected from long range to cap a decisive 8-0 run. ""They made a couple of big plays at the end that gave them separation,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""That was the difference in the game."" Brandon Ingram scored 22 points and Josh Hart had 15 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, which began the season without No. 1 pick Zion Williamson. JJ Redick scored 16 points, Nicolo Melli had 14 and Holiday added 13. The Pelicans made 19 turnovers, leading to 22 Toronto points. Twelve of New Orleans' turnovers came in the second half and overtime. ""We played hard, but we've also got to play smart,"" Gentry said. ""We didn't play smart down the stretch there."" Lowry made a pair of free throws to tie it 117-all with 29 seconds left in regulation, and Toronto's Norman Powell grabbed the rebound on a missed shot by Holiday, giving the Raptors one last shot with 8.9 seconds to go. Powell got the ball, but his long 3-pointer hit the back of the rim and bounced out, sending it to overtime. Before the game, the Raptors received the biggest championship rings in NBA history and unfurled a banner celebrating their six-game triumph over Golden State last June. ""I have to start lifting more weights so I can carry it around,"" VanVleet joked. The Raptors lost NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard to the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency, and also saw guard Danny Green leave for the Lakers. Before the game, Gentry said losing a star player doesn't always hurt a team's fortunes. ""Bryce Harper is gone, too, but where are the Nationals?"" Gentry asked rhetorically about Washington's World Series baseball team. ""I wouldn't count these guys out just yet."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson is expected to miss at least six weeks after right knee surgery Monday. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound former Duke star averaged 23.2 points in four preseason games. He missed New Orleans' final exhibition game in New York last Friday night. Raptors: Toronto was without forwards Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (left groin) and Patrick McCaw (left knee). NO CHARGES FOR UJIRI California prosecutors said Tuesday they won't charge Raptors President Masai Ujiri for an altercation with a sheriff's deputy after the NBA championship clincher in Oakland last June. The DA's office said it met with Ujiri and his attorneys Monday and decided the matter was better handled ""outside of the courtroom."" BACK OFF! VanVleet was frustrated after rolling his ankle late in the third quarter when he landed on a courtside cameraman. ""How many times does it have to happen before you think about doing something else?"" VanVleet said. ""It's happened to me at least four or five times in the last two years. This is the worst."" VanVleet was able to return, playing eight minutes in the fourth and all of overtime.","401160623"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard hit seven straight shots in one stretch, creating a run for the Clippers that his new teammates quickly joined. ""It's a great sign of leadership,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""He talks with his game."" Leonard began a new career chapter Tuesday night, scoring 30 points to go with a strong bench effort in a 112-102 victory over LeBron James and the Lakers in the teams' season opener. Leonard chose the Clippers because he wanted to come home and his family was on hand. ""All those emotions went through me again,"" he said. Lou Williams added 21 points and Montrezl Harrell had 17 off the bench when the Clippers began their 50th season overall and 36th in Los Angeles as the once unlikely but now favorites to win the franchise's first NBA championship. ""It's one of 82 (games),"" Rivers said. ""Next question."" Leonard won his second NBA title last season in Toronto. The Lakers showed off their new 1-2 punch of James and Anthony Davis. Davis scored 25 points, making 9 of 14 free throws, and James had 18. ""For us, we're both aggressive,"" Davis said. ""Sometimes we kind of miss each other. I missed him a couple times and he missed me, so just trying to figure it out."" Danny Green outscored them both with 28 points, including seven 3-pointers, in the highest-scoring debut by a Laker in franchise history. Leonard got it done without his personal recruit Paul George, sidelined indefinitely while rehabbing from a pair of offseason shoulder surgeries. ""It's just the first game of the season, so it's going to take the season and mistakes and success to get us on the same page,"" Leonard said. Wearing a black tuxedo jacket and bow tie, George received a mixed reaction when introduced in the playoff-like atmosphere at Staples Center, where the Clippers were the home team for the first of four meetings in the arena the teams share. ""Their fans were very loud early and I thought our fans took over from that point on,"" Rivers said. ""It's great for the city."" The Clippers' reserves outscored the Lakers' bench, 60-19. Last season, Williams and Harrell were the NBA's highest-scoring reserve duo, and they picked up where they left off. ""This bench is going to be better this year than even last year,"" Rivers said. It came down to the fourth quarter, and the Clippers dominated. Tied 85-all, they opened with a 19-7 run to go up 104-92. Five different players scored and Leonard assisted on Maurice Harkless' 3-pointer. James had three of the Lakers' six turnovers in the fourth, when Harkless and Leonard each blocked shots by Dwight Howard. ""That was just very careless and they capitalized off of it,"" James said. With 4  1/2 minutes left, Lakers fans chanted ""Let's go, Lakers! Let's go, Lakers!"" while others hit the exits. ""The NBA's back and everyone's trying to have the narrative of it's a rivalry game and it's a huge test,"" James said, ""but I think both teams are not where they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve."" The Lakers erased a 14-point deficit in the third, led by Danny Green's 18 points. He capped a 15-0 run with his fifth 3-pointer before JaMychal Green's 3-pointer pulled the Clippers into an 85-all tie heading into the fourth. The Clippers outscored the Lakers 40-29 in the second quarter, buoyed by 16 points from Leonard. He made seven straight shots on a variety of moves -- pullups, fadeaways, a cutting dunk. The Lakers raced to a 13-2 lead, their largest of the game. James scored over Leonard and he later heard ""MVP! MVP!"" chants while sinking his first free throws of the season. The Lakers shot 53% from the floor in the first quarter, while the Clippers missed shots and had a basket by Williams taken away when the Lakers challenged a foul call on Howard. The rivalry was on early with a male fan shouting ""Go Lakers!"" during the national anthem, drawing big cheers while Clipper fans booed. ""It was everything I expected,"" Davis said. ""Very anticipated game and it was fun."" TIP-INS Lakers: They fell to 43-29 all-time in season openers. ... G Rajon Rondo (sore right calf) sat out. Clippers: They improved to 25-25 in openers all-time, but still trail the Lakers 3-2 when the teams meet in a season opener. ... G Rodney McGruder (right ankle sprain) missed the game. WARNING FANS As part of the NBA's crackdown on fan behavior this season, cards carrying a message from league security were on seats located courtside and the first couple rows back. They reminded that every fan is required to comply with the league's fan code of conduct and anyone who acts inappropriately may be subject to ejection and-or revocation of their tickets. The public address announcer reminded fans before both halves about minding their manners. LEONARD'S GREETING Leonard took to the mic to welcome Clippers fans to the game. He had to raise his usually low voice to be heard over the din, a mix of cheers from Clippers fans and boos from Lakers fans. ""It's going to be a great season,"" Leonard said. ""We're going to play hard every night. Let's get it going."" STARRY NIGHT Famous faces came out, including Kate Hudson, Angela Bassett, Jeff Garlin, and athletes Lisa Leslie and Diana Taurasi of the WNBA, Joc Pederson of the Dodgers and soccer player Alex Morgan. Halsey performed outdoors at LA Live before the game and Ty Dolla $ign rapped at halftime.","401160624"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  When Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak took PJ Washington with the 12th pick in the draft, he suggested the Kentucky forward might spend this season bouncing back and forth between Charlotte and its G League affiliate to gain experience. Washington had other ideas. The 21-year-old was stellar in his NBA debut, scoring 27 points on 7-of-11 shooting from 3-point range as the Hornets opened the post-Kemba Walker era with a thrilling come-from-behind 126-125 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. Washington's seven 3s set an NBA record for a player making his debut, and his 27 points were the most since Gordan Giricek in 2002. Washington, who wasn't named a starter until 90 minutes before tipoff, laughed when asked about the idea of playing in Greensboro. ""Definitely I used that as motivation,"" Washington said. ""It's not a bad thing to go down to the G League and produce and get some playing time. But I didn't want to. I wanted to be up here on the biggest stage and improve my game every day."" Washington won't be going anywhere if he plays anywhere near like he did against the Bulls. He led the charge for the Hornets, who made 23 3-pointers, setting an NBA record for the most 3s in a season opener. It was also the Hornets' most 3-pointers in a regulation game. The franchise record is 24, set in a game that had two overtimes. Backup point guard Devonte Graham was a difference-maker off the bench with 23 points on 6-of-7 3-point shooting to go along with eight assists, while Marvin Williams had 17 points on five 3s. Washington, Graham and Williams were a combined 18 of 25 from 3-point range, offsetting the Bulls' 78 points in the paint. ""They got open looks and they got comfortable,"" said Chicago's Lauri Markkanen, who finished with 35 points and 17 rebounds. ""Even if our hand was up, they were making shots. So, 23 3s is way too many."" Cody Zeller added 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte. TIP-INS Bulls: Outrebounded the Hornets 49-41. ... Allowed the Hornets to shoot 52.3% from 3-point range. Hornets: Coach James Borrego went with Rozier, Dwayne Bacon, Miles Bridges, Zeller and Washington as his starting five, a combination that has just 13 years of combined NBA experience. ... The previous record for points by a Hornets rookie in a season opener was Emeka Okafor with 19. ... Nic Batum left the game in the second half with a broken finger. GRAHAM STEPS UP Graham played so well that he replaced high-profile acquisition Terry Rozier at point guard in the game's final minutes. He led the Hornets back from a 10-point deficit with less than 6 minutes remaining, knocking down a pair of 3-pointers to ignite a rally. Graham also had two key free throws with 11.3 seconds to put the Hornets up by three late in the game. ""Just keep shooting,"" Graham said. ""My coaches keep telling me to let it fly and they have a lot of confidence in me, so I just have to come out here with that same confidence that they believe I have."" FORGETTABLE DEBUT Rozier, who was brought in as Walker's replacement, struggled in his Charlotte debut with seven points on 2-of-10 shooting. He had six assists but turned the ball over four times. COSTLY DECISION Instead of going for a 3-pointer to tie the game with 4 seconds left, Zach LaVine drove for a layup. The Hornets ran out the clock from there with the Bulls unable to foul. ""I think he was hoping it was like six seconds, but it was four and a half,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. WHITE'S HOMECOMING Chicago got a strong game from its top draft pick Coby White, who had 17 points, seven assists and only one turnover in his NBA debut in his home state. ""I feel like I played with a lot of effort and a lot of energy,"" said White, who was 6 of 13 from the field. ""I felt like I could have hit more shots, but shots aren't always going to fall so I'm not going to be too hard on myself. For me, it's all about winning so I'm kind of discouraged we didn't come up with a win."" IN THE PAINT Borrego said if the Hornets give up 78 points in the paint on a regular basis, ""that's going to cost us a lot of points. Our defense has to be better.""","401160625"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Andre Drummond softened up the perimeter by hammering away in the middle. Luke Kennard finally took advantage late. It was quite an opening-night combination for the Detroit Pistons. Drummond scored 32 points, grabbed 23 rebounds and blocked four shots while Kennard made half of his career-high six 3-pointers in the final six minutes to help the Pistons pull away for a 119-110 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. ""I'm glad he (Drummond) is on my team,"" Derrick Rose said after his Pistons debut. ""It just feels good to win, especially the first game."" The Pacers had billed their opener as the debut of a new era complete with four new starters and a retro lineup with 6-foot-11 Myles Turner and 6-11 Domantas Sabonis playing alongside one another. But Drummond and Kennard ruined the big unveil. The league's three-time rebounding champ was a wrecking ball right from the start, knocking down 12 of 18 shots and even making his last eight free throws after missing the first two. Kennard warmed up late, scoring 16 of his career-high 30 points in the final 11 minutes. Indiana never recovered. Sabonis had 27 points and 13 rebounds and Malcolm Brogdon added 22 points in his first game with the Pacers. ""We got outworked tonight, I think,"" Turner said after scoring 25 points. ""That's one thing we hang our hat on here, outworking people. I think we got outworked and they were a little grittier than we were."" It was far from pretty, though. The teams combined for 33 turnovers and 29 fouls resulting in a back-and-forth game in which neither team seized control for long. Indiana extended a 55-54 halftime lead to 73-64 midway through the third quarter then nearly gave it all away as the Pistons closed to 86-83 after three. Drummond helped the Pistons trade punches early in the fourth, just long enough for Kennard to heat up. When he knocked down the second of back-to-back 3s to end an 8-0 run with 4:40 to play, Detroit led 105-101. His third 3 of the quarter, with 1:24 left made it 113-103 and sealed the Pacers fate. ""I love the way we fought,"" Kennard said. ""That was great to come into an atmosphere like this, opening night, for a team on the road it's not always easy to come away with a win. TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond, the NBA leader in double-doubles last season, moved within one game of tying Shaquille O'Neal (34) for the second-most 20-20 game since 1988-89. ... Rose had 18 points and went 5 for 5 from the field in the first half. ... Tony Snell scored 10 points on a night the Pistons committed 18 turnovers. ... Detroit's bench outscored Indiana 57-16. Pacers: T.J. Warren was taken straight to the locker room with 3:46 left after taking a hard spill following an offensive foul. He finished with 10 points. .... Brogdon was 10 of 11 from the free- throw line, and Jeremy Lamb scored 10 points in his first game with Indiana. ... The Pacers were outrebounded 45-36 and lost on opening night for the first time in four years. OLADIPO UPDATE Two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo has participated in two five-on-five practices since he was cleared by team doctors late last week. So far, coach Nate McMillan said Oladipo has had looked fine. But he's also likely weeks away from taking another big step. ""He looks OK out there,"" McMillan said, noting Oladipo is only practicing every other day. ""He wants to play a little more but he's limited for what he can do for the next month or so before he gets re-evaluated."" REPLACING THE PISTON Six-time All-Star Blake Griffin missed the game with an injured left hamstring and a sore knee. And until he returns, the Pistons may find themselves cobbling together spare parts till he can return. But coach Dwane Casey had to like what he saw Wednesday. When times get tough, that's when everyone looks to Blake,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""You know when you go a couple possessions without a basket, we usually look to Blake. So in those situations, who do we go to? I think that's what we have to find out.""","401160626"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Markelle Fultz's first show in Orlando was a big hit. Fultz had 12 points and six assists, helping the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 94-85 on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. ""He was the difference in the game in the second half,"" coach Steve Clifford said. Fultz was selected by Philadelphia with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft. The 21-year-old guard played 33 games in two seasons with the 76ers before he was traded to Orlando in February. He was the first Magic player off the bench with 7:10 left in the first quarter. He made his first four shots. ""Anytime you have a chance to see the ball go in the hoop, the basket just keeps getting bigger and bigger,"" he said. ""It just gave me more confidence. It made me say: `Hey, it's back. I'm good. Let's just keep moving."" Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and nine rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 16 points. Kevin Love had 11 points and 18 rebounds for Cleveland, which trailed by as many as 20 points. Collin Sexton and Tristan Thompson each scored 16 points in John Beilein's first game as Cavs coach. Darius Garland finished with eight points on 3-for-9 shooting in his NBA debut. Garland was drafted by Cleveland with the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft. Fournier scored to give Orlando a 53-33 lead with 2:37 left in the first half, but Cleveland battled back in the third quarter. Sexton made a 3-pointer and Thompson had two straight buckets to trim the Magic's lead to 59-54 with 7:31 left. The Cavaliers were down 73-67 early in the fourth when Terrence Ross and Mo Bamba each made a 3 to help the Magic pull away. ""There were a few key moments when we had wide-open shots and missed them, and they had wide-open shots and made them,"" Beilein said. ""We get it to five and then all of a sudden it's 12. Then we get it back to five or six and all of a sudden it's 12 or 14."" HOW TO GET BETTER Beilein figures the Cavaliers will get better just by playing. ""There's nothing like being in game shape,"" Beilein said before the game. ""How do you get in game shape? You play games. You'll improve exponentially once you start playing games, and that's where the improvement should really spike now."" REBOUNDING DEFICIENCY ""We did a lot of good things, but the rebounding game was a problem,"" Clifford said. ""We haven't rebounded in preseason and we didn't rebound tonight. And turnovers. We were just really sloppy with the ball and that was really impacting how we play."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love (18), Larry Nance Jr. (14) and Thompson (11) led Cleveland to a 54-46 rebounding edge. ... Garland also had five assists. Magic: Fultz shot 6 for 12. He missed all three of his 3-point attempts. ... The Magic have won five of eight against the Cavaliers since losing 17 straight.","401160627"
"Kyrie Irving discusses his first game as a Net and what he could have done differently at the end of overtime. (1:48) NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving fell down and frantically rose up, still with a shot to save his Nets debut. Moments later he was back on the court, laying on his back in disbelief after falling just short in the highest-scoring first game for a team in NBA history. Irving scored 50 points but lost his balance and missed a potential winning shot that allowed the Minnesota Timberwolves to pull out a 127-126 victory over Brooklyn in overtime Wednesday night. Despite the loss, Irving said the first game in his new uniform felt incredible. ""It's a great starting point,"" he said. ""Obviously, you wanted to come out and get a win in front of our home crowd, but we got another chance on Friday."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 36 points and 14 rebounds for Minnesota, and Andrew Wiggins finished with 21 points, including the go-ahead basket with 1:19 remaining. Following a Nets timeout, Irving had the ball in his hands with a chance to cap his dazzling debut with a victory. He ran the clock down and then began his drive, but went down after spinning near the foul line. He retained his dribble, got up and shot, but his jumper missed. He then fell back onto the court, hands on his head. After signing with the Nets during the summer, Irving broke Kiki Vandeweghe's record for most points by a player in his first game with a team. Vandeweghe scored 47 for Portland at Kansas City on Oct. 27, 1984. Irving finished with eight rebounds and seven assists. Caris LeVert added 20 points. Irving signed along with Kevin Durant in July, wanting to come back home after growing up in New Jersey. He had to pause during his remarks to the crowd before the game but had no trouble keeping his composure -- but ultimately not his footing -- once it started, making seven 3-pointers as the Nets tried desperately to win a season opener for the first time in seven years. But Brooklyn didn't have many answers for Towns, who also made seven 3s. Then in OT it was Wiggins, who shot only 10 for 27 but made two straight baskets after the Nets took a 124-123 lead. Irving sandwiched two 3-pointers around three free throws in just over a minute late in regulation, and with the game tied found a cutting Jarrett Allen in the lane. Allen was fouled but missed both free throws with 5.7 seconds remaining, and the game went to overtime when Wiggins missed a long jumper at the buzzer. ""This is a special group where very rarely this happens in the NBA,"" Towns said. ""Everyone in this locker room is here for one goal. That's to win."" Early on it was all Minnesota as it started its first full season under coach Ryan Saunders. The Wolves led 20-19 in the first quarter before breaking it open with an 18-3 run that lasted into the second and expanded their lead to 38-22. It would increase to 46-28 and Minnesota took a 68-56 advantage into halftime. But the Nets outscored the Wolves 37-20 in the third and it was close from there. ""It was eventful,"" Saunders said. ""You're kind of lost for words."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jarrett Culver, the No. 6 overall pick from NCAA runner-up Texas Tech, had four points. His parents and grandmother were at the game. ... Minnesota has won the last four meetings. Nets: Durant, recovering from Achilles tendon surgery, was the first player announced when the Nets introduced the entire roster before the game. He walked onto the court and eventually joined his teammates to watch from the bench. ... Brooklyn has lost seven straight season openers. ... The Nets signed Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, a former first-round pick, to a two-way contract. OPENING NIGHT EMOTIONS Irving spoke to the crowd from the court before the game and briefly had to stop his speech when it appeared he was getting choked up. ""It just hit me before the game,"" Irving said. ""I wasn't trying to get too emotional or anything like that, but I'm just a Jersey kid playing for his home team. There's nothing like it. This has been brewing since I was in fourth grade."" SLEEPING IN The Wolves opted against holding a morning shootaround. Saunders said the team will at times look to get players extra rest while on the road. ""I'll use the word fluid and say that it'll be a game-by-game decision and see how these guys feel,"" he said. ""Obviously we're a team that looks at analytics and looks at data and looks at numbers. We want to make sure we take care of our players and these players especially, the pace we were able to play at in preseason, we want to make sure these guys are rested.""","401160628"
"MIAMI --  An opening-night sellout crowd in Miami came to see Jimmy Butler. They wound up being enthralled by rookies Kendrick Nunn and Chris Silva instead. Justise Winslow finished with 27 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, Nunn scored 24 points in his NBA debut and the Heat -- playing without Butler, who missed the game for personal reasons -- put together a huge fourth quarter to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 120-101 on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. ""Just the beginning,"" Nunn said. His beginning had a heck of a finish. A 24-1 run in the fourth turned everything around for Miami, which trailed 86-83 after Grayson Allen scored the opening basket of the final quarter for Memphis. After that, it was all Miami. Nunn and Silva -- also making his NBA debut -- combined for 19 points on 8-for-10 shooting in the fourth, with eight rebounds and three blocks. The Grizzlies, total, managed 17 points, seven rebounds and no blocks in the fourth. ""Obviously a tough one,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said after his career debut. ""The fourth quarter is not indicative of who we are and what we can be."" Ja Morant, the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, scored 14 points and had four assists for Memphis. Jaren Jackson Jr. led the Grizzlies with 17 points, and Tyus Jones added 15. Morant got off to a fast start, making his first four shots and going 5 for 7 in the first half. He picked up his fourth foul 17 seconds into the second half, and finished 6 for 12 from the floor. ""I'm not focused on the positives,"" Morant said. ""For me it's just the negative. I felt I could have been better in a lot of places, help my team out with turning up the pace to keep us going. They capitalized on a lot of our mistakes tonight."" Goran Dragic scored 19 points for Miami, while Bam Adebayo had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Butler was with the Heat for their morning shootaround practice, then told the team around mid-afternoon that he would not be able to play. ""Everything is fine,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Heat were also without guard Dion Waiters, suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team, and forward James Johnson -- still out because of a conditioning issue that kept him from training camp and sidelined for all five of Miami's preseason games. Memphis hasn't won a season-opening game on the road since the franchise's inaugural game at Portland in 1995. The Grizzlies are 0-7 in openers away from home since. TIP-INS Grizzlies: None of the five players who started Memphis' opener last year are still with the Grizzlies. ... Jonas Valanciunas picked up four fouls by halftime, a first in his career. He'd had three fouls by the break on 73 previous occasions, including playoffs. ... Memphis had 60 points by halftime, a team record for a season opener. The previous high was 56 -- by Vancouver against Seattle in 2000. A year ago, Memphis had 39 at halftime of Game 1. Heat: Having Herro and Nunn in the starting lineup marked the fourth time in franchise history that Miami had two rookies in the first five on opening night. They joined Kevin Edwards and Rony Seikaly (1988), Udonis Haslem and Dwyane Wade (2003) and Mario Chalmers and Michael Beasley (2008). ... Spoelstra is beginning his 25th season with the organization. ALLEN RETURNS Ray Allen was back, and back in his spot. The former Heat guard attended the opener, and when he was introduced to the crowd after the first quarter, he went to the far corner opposite the Heat bench -- where he hit the overtime-forcing 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals against San Antonio, a series Miami would win in seven games. ""It's like I never left,"" Allen said. YOUNG DEBUTS Herro, at 19 years and 276 days, became the youngest player to ever start for the Heat. Morant -- 20 years and 74 days -- became the second-youngest player to start a season opener for the Grizzlies. Shareef Abdur-Rahim was 19 years, 326 days old when he opened for Vancouver against Portland on Nov. 1, 1996.","401160629"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid was popped in the mouth by an elbow that drew blood, rattled teeth, and stunned the Sixers' big man. Embiid shook off the knock after a short stint on the bench, then Philadelphia took off and won the first round in a bruising matchup between two teams expected to fight for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Embiid had 15 points and 13 rebounds, Ben Simmons scored 24 points and the 76ers beat the Boston Celtics 107-93 on Wednesday night. The season opener had a May feel from the opening tip. Boston and Philly roughed up each other, combining for more than 60 fouls. They each showed off their prized free agent acquisitions. But it was the Sixers who turned in a dominant fourth quarter. ""It felt like a playoff atmosphere, already,"" Philadelphia guard Josh Richardson said. ""It was ready to pop from the jump."" Philly's superstars can only do so much, and the other Sixers were clutch in the fourth when they needed them. Furkan Korkmaz and Tobias Harris buried consecutive 3-pointers -- after the Sixers had missed 21 of 24 through three quarters -- to stretch the lead to 10. Even without that scrutinized jumper in play, Simmons was smooth and sensational as he attacked the hoop for easy baskets. He used a nifty spin move in the paint to hit Kyle O'Quinn for a basket that made it 90-74. The packed house went wild as the backups, a weak spot in the postseason, put the Sixers on the decisive run. Simmons also had nine assists and eight rebounds, though he played his 161st career game without a 3. ""I'm skilled, I'm gifted, I'm pretty good at what I do,"" Simmons said. Gordon Hayward led the Celtics with 25 points. Jayson Tatum had 21. Kemba Walker scored 12 points on 4-of-18 shooting in his Boston debut, and Al Horford had 16 points in his first game with the 76ers. Horford spent the last three seasons with the Celtics and was one of the few defenders that gave Embiid fits. Horford signed a four-year deal to come to Philly and quickly became a popular teammate. Walker was signed to a four-year, $141 million deal, the most Boston could offer, but $80 million less than the Charlotte Hornets could have paid him over five seasons. ""Tough night for many of us,"" Walker said. ""I wish I could have played a lot better for these guys."" About the only sign of a rough patch for Philly came when Embiid was drilled by Jaylen Brown's elbow early in the third. Embiid pressed a towel to this face after the hit and did not talk to the media because of swelling. Brown was whistled for his fifth foul, and Embiid sat out for a couple of minutes. He hardly seemed bothered by his mouth the rest of the game -- he slid across the court as he tried to save the ball from going out of bounds, drawing a loud ""Let's go Sixers!"" chant. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston twice missed consecutive free throws in the second half, giving delirious 76ers fans a free dessert and fries at a food fast chain. 76ers: Allen Iverson was in the house wearing a No. 23 Trey Burke jersey. ... Rapper Biz Markie was at the game. ... The bell trolls for thee? Horford rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell. SLOW START Walker had a rough night from the floor, Tatum scuffled through 8-of-22 shooting and the Celtics shot only 37 percent overall. ""All that means with Kemba and Tatum, there are a lot of good nights coming,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. GAME SHAPE Embiid said at the start of training camp that he lost 20 pounds over the offseason and aimed for at least five more before opening night. Coach Brett Brown said he didn't know if the two-time All-Star center had reached his weight goal. Brown said Embiid's health is the ""best he's ever been,"" but there's work ahead. ""Is he an A-plus right now,"" Brown asked. ""No, he is not. But he is trending in the way that we want. And nobody asked him to be that on opening night."" The 25-year-old Embiid has never played in more than 64 games a season and has vowed to top that total in 2019-2020. The Sixers care more about having their franchise player healthy for the postseason than reaching some arbitrary number. ""I feel when I look at him, I think he looks healthy,"" Brown said. ""He looks like he's ready to have a great season.""","401160630"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic won a showdown with Bradley Beal because the star Dallas guard stayed in the game while his Washington counterpart was ejected after the last of several fourth-quarter exchanges between the two. Not long after, Kristaps Porzingis had a one-handed dunk on an alley-oop to help the Mavericks turn away a late rally by the Wizards. Perhaps not exactly how the Mavericks saw the European pair tag-teaming on the way to a win in their long-awaited first game together, but effective nonetheless. Doncic had 34 points and nine rebounds, Porzingis finished off his 23 points with the game-sealing dunk in the final minute and the Mavericks beat the Wizards 108-100 in the season opener Wednesday night. ""It's just hoops,"" Beal said. ""You see it when I got kicked out, he came over and he was the first one to dap me. We weren't fighting. That was just basketball, trying to frustrate him. He was kicking our butt. Had to do something."" Washington rookie Rui Hachimura, the first Japanese-born player drafted in the first round, had 14 points and 10 rebounds. The ninth overall pick out of Gonzaga scored his first points before Porzingis hit his first bucket as a Maverick. The Wizards had cut a 23-point deficit going into the fourth quarter to seven when Doncic and Beal were called for double technicals with 1:09 remaining. Beal was ejected when he was almost immediately whistled for a second technical. Doncic missed the free throw and a 3-pointer, but the Mavericks kept the ball alive and Jalen Brunson found a cutting Porzingis for the slam. Porzingis missed his first four shots before taking a break and coming back to score nine points in the final 2:45 of the first quarter. The 7-foot-3 Latvian acquired in a blockbuster deal with the New York Knicks before the trading deadline last season was 7 of 16 from the field. Doncic and Porzingis traded long 3-pointers throughout the game, finishing 7 of 16 between them (4 of 9 for Doncic, 3 of 7 for Porzingis). Doncic was 12 of 19 overall to help the Mavericks win their opener for the first time in four years. The Slovenian guard and reigning NBA rookie of the year could have played with Porzingis last season, but the Mavericks decided to let the 2018 All-Star continue recovering from a knee injury in what ended up being his final game for the Knicks 20 months ago. ""It's finally here,"" Porzingis said. ""I just want to enjoy the moment. I don't want to put too much pressure on myself when I'm out there. Most importantly I'm here to win. I'm not here to chase something individually."" Beal scored 19 points less than a week after the All-Star guard signed a $72 million, two-year extension that will go through the 2022-23 season, with a player option after that. The Wizards are without his backcourt mate, John Wall, who tore an Achilles tendon last December. ""Give our guys credit, they battled back and then they cut the lead to a respectable number,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""Brad came in and almost made it more interesting than the final score."" TIP-INS Wizards: Moritz Wagner was 3 of 4 on 3-pointers and scored 13 points before the second-year player fouled out with three minutes left in his Washington debut. ... Thomas Bryant had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Mavericks: Dallas still isn't sure how much longer Dwight Powell will be out with a left hamstring strain sustained early in training camp. The sixth-year player is expected to start at center when he's ready. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. left the game in the second quarter after injuring his right ankle but returned before halftime. RUI'S DEBUT Hachimura scored six points in the first quarter and finished 7 of 15 from the field. The 6-8 forward missed all three of his 3-point attempts, including one with the Wizards down nine points just inside two minutes. ""This is just the beginning,"" Hachimura said. LIFE AFTER DIRK The first look for Dallas fans at the Doncic-Porzingis pairing came in the Mavericks' first game at American Airlines Center without German star Dirk Nowitzki. Their last home game without the only NBA player to spend all 21 seasons with the same franchise was April 14, 1998, a 111-95 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at Reunion Arena. Nowitzki retired at 40 after last season as the league's highest-scoring foreign-born player.","401160631"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The lessons are coming early for New York Knicks rookie RJ Barrett. From his first NBA game? ""You've got to keep going, especially if you get up,"" he said. It's a concept Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray knows well. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points, Bryn Forbes added 20 and San Antonio rallied for a 120-111 victory over the Knicks on Wednesday night, spoiling Barrett's debut. The Spurs outscored the Knicks 37-27 in the final quarter after Barrett rallied New York from a 16-point deficit in the first half. Barrett scored 21 points on 9-for-13 shooting with five rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. ""You've got to keep putting it on them,"" Barrett said. ""Just like we're not going to quit, they're not going to quit either."" The Knicks have pinned a great deal of hope on Barrett, the No. 3 overall draft pick out of Duke, after failing to sign any marquee free agents in the offseason. ""I told you,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. ""When the popcorn's popping, that kid is ready."" Marcus Morris led New York with 26 points, and Julius Randle added 25 points and 11 rebounds. The Spurs are similarly counting on Murray, who played in his first game since tearing his right ACL in a preseason game last October. ""I'm blessed, I'm thankful,"" Murray said. ""I put in the work, but I've got a lot of work to do. A year ago today I was at home, I couldn't walk, and a year later I'm playing. So, I'm thankful."" Murray had 18 points, including a 3-pointer with five minutes remaining that put San Antonio up 105-97. The 6-foot-5 point guard had six assists and eight rebounds. ""I thought he was aggressive, tried to do what we wanted to do and played pretty good defense,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Probably needs to take care of the ball a little bit better, but overall after being out so long, he's come a long way pretty quickly."" Murray had four turnovers and San Antonio committed 21 as a team, which led to 32 points for New York. The Spurs did not have any turnovers in the fourth quarter, however. NOTHING SETTLED New York started Barrett, Randle, Morris, Bobby Portis and Alonzo Trier, but Fizdale said the lineup could change as soon as Saturday against Washington, especially at point guard. Barrett started at point guard, but veteran Elfrid Payton had nine points and four assists in the second half while running the point with Barrett at off guard. TIP-INS Knicks: Morris, who signed with the Knicks after backing out of a verbal agreement with the Spurs on a two-year deal, was heavily booed throughout the game. Morris responded to the initial boos by backing down and then hitting a turnaround jumper on DeMar DeRozan for the game's opening points. ... The Knicks signed F Ivan Rabb to a two-way contract. The 6-foot-10, 220-pounder averaged 5.7 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 14.6 minutes over two seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies. He will primarily play for New York's G League affiliate, the Westchester Knicks. Spurs: Trey Lyles, who the Spurs signed after Morris reneged, started at center and had eight points and 11 rebounds. ... Popovich opened his 24th season as San Antonio's coach, setting the record for most seasons coaching one franchise. Popovich was previously tied with Utah's Jerry Sloan. ... Popovich acknowledged the Spurs fully guaranteed the final year of Aldridge's contract. Aldridge was guaranteed $7 million for 2021 before the Spurs picked up their option Wednesday to fully guarantee his $24 million contract. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Soon as Donovan Mitchell started imposing his will on both ends of the court in the fourth quarter, there was nothing anybody could do to stop him. Mitchell's all-around performance Wednesday night led the Utah Jazz to a 100-95 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the season opener for both teams. On one end, the Jazz guard was crashing the boards and securing the ball. At the other end, he repeatedly slashed to the rim for one big basket after another. Mitchell finished with 32 points and 12 rebounds, becoming the first Utah player with at least 30 points and 10 boards in a season opener since Carlos Boozer did it to open the 2007-08 season. ""I just wanted to attack,"" Mitchell said. ""When you have teammates that trust you, coaches that trust you with the ball, it really makes it easy to keep going and make the right plays."" His biggest impact came in the fourth period, when Mitchell had 14 points and seven rebounds. He made several key buckets down the stretch to help the Jazz rally and snap a seven-game regular-season losing streak to the Thunder. Oklahoma City built an eight-point lead early in the fourth before Utah surged ahead 85-80 on a 9-0 run capped by Bojan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer. Chris Paul capped a 6-0 spurt with a long jumper of his own to put the Thunder ahead 86-85. Mitchell answered by slashing into the lane for back-to-back layups to put the Jazz ahead for good. A mid-range jumper from Mitchell gave Utah a 96-91 lead with 21 seconds remaining. Jazz coach Quin Snyder pointed to Mitchell's effort on help-side defense and his rotations as being an equally important difference-maker during that stretch run. ""He's much improved right now defensively because he's demanding it of himself and he's competing,"" Snyder said. Bogdanovic added 16 points and Royce O'Neale chipped in with 14 for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert grabbed 14 rebounds. The Jazz outscored the Thunder 58-34 in the paint to offset 6-of-24 shooting from 3-point range. ""We missed a lot of stuff at the rim tonight and generally we've been fairly good there and getting stuff downhill at the basket,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shined in his Thunder debut, scoring a career-high 26 points on 10-of-23 shooting. Paul added 22 points and eight rebounds. Danilo Gallinari had 21 points and seven boards. Oklahoma City missed nine of its first 11 shots and hit just 23.8% (5 of 21) overall from the floor in the first quarter. Those shooting struggles opened the door for Utah to sprint out to a 23-10 lead. Starting with a jumper from Joe Ingles, the Jazz scored baskets on four straight possessions to carve out a double-digit advantage. The Thunder made a pair of 8-0 runs to tie the game at 28 in the second period. They finally took their first lead after Gilgeous-Alexander made three straight baskets to fuel a 9-2 spurt. Paul capped it with a pair of free throws, giving Oklahoma City a 46-42 lead. Utah answered with a 7-0 run -- punctuated by a thunderous dunk from Mitchell -- to go ahead 49-46 at halftime. ""We learned we've got a lot of grit and fight with us, but there is no moral victories,"" Paul said. ""We felt like we let one slip away, but I do feel good about how we played."" SHOTS NOT FALLING Mike Conley went 1 of 16 from the field in his Utah debut after spending his first 12 seasons with Memphis. He missed his first 12 shots before finally scoring on a floater in the lane with 5.9 seconds left in the third quarter. Conley finished with five points after adding a pair of free throws with 2.1 seconds left. He made a big impact on the defensive end late, helping limit Paul and Gilgeous-Alexander to eight combined fourth-quarter points. ""I didn't want to just be out there missing shots,"" Conley said. ""I wanted to be out there helping the team as best as I can and I just tried to be that for the team tonight."" MEMORABLE MUDIAY Emmanuel Mudiay shrugged off a tough preseason that included a hamstring injury by scoring 12 points and dishing out five assists in his Jazz debut. Mudiay hit a pair of critical layups midway through the fourth quarter to help Utah rally. ""He's been doing the work,"" Snyder said.  ""Our whole staff is dug in on him."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City went 6 of 12 from 3-point range in the second quarter. ... Darius Bazley finished with zero points and three rebounds in his NBA debut. ... Steven Adams pulled down 11 rebounds but finished with just three points after shooting 1 of 8 from the field and 1 for 6 from the line. Jazz: Bogdanovic went to the locker room midway through the second quarter after injuring his ankle. He returned in the third. ... Utah finished with an 18-7 edge in fast-break points.","401160653"
"PHOENIX --  Coach Monty Williams wanted Jevon Carter to slow down. The backup point guard didn't pay attention. Two unexpected 3-pointers later, the Phoenix Suns had the spark they needed to blow past the Sacramento Kings for a 124-95 win in the season opener for both teams on Wednesday night. ""Jevon just doesn't listen to me, that's pretty much it,"" Williams said with a grin. ""He just goes nuts, hits shots and defensively he gets all over people. He has selective hearing. I was trying to scream to him to slow down, but he's a pitbull. That's what I love about him."" While the reserves stepped up, the starters played well, too. Devin Booker had 22 points and 10 assists, and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 21 points. Veteran guard Ricky Rubio had 11 points, 11 assists, six rebounds and four steals in his first game after signing a three-year deal worth $51 million. It was an encouraging night for a franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs since 2010 and finished with a dismal 19-63 record last season. ""We have a lot of potential, but it's just one game,"" Rubio said. ""We have to show it every night. Tomorrow we come back, go to practice and get better."" Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick one year ago, added 18 points and 11 rebounds while shooting 9 of 14 from the field. Sacramento was led by Buddy Hield, who scored 22 of his 28 points in the first half. Hield shot 10 of 19 from the field, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range. Marvin Bagley III added 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Kings shot just 28 percent from the field and had 18 turnovers in the second half. ""They had the momentum, they made shots, they made plays, they played harder than us,"" Hield said. ""They deserved to win."" Williams won in his Suns coaching debut. The 48-year-old Williams coached the New Orleans Hornets for five seasons from 2010-15 and got another opportunity with Phoenix during the offseason. The Suns trailed by five at halftime but rallied for an 86-76 advantage headed into the fourth. Carter hit back-to-back 3-pointers late in the third to give the Suns some unexpected offense, highlighting an impressive run by the Suns' second unit. Carter finished with 11 points, including three 3-pointers. Tyler Johnson added 10 points in 17 minutes. ""We just go out there, play hard and play together,"" Carter said. ""Sometimes it's going to work. Sometimes it's not. But I feel more times than not it's going to work."" EMOTIONAL NIGHT Williams also won as a head coach for the first time without his wife Ingrid, who died in a car accident in 2016 at 44 years old. ""First time I've done this without Ingrid and that was just different,"" Williams said. ""A lot of emotions, a lot of good stuff. So thankful my kids were there tonight for the whole game and got to see that. So glad I got to do that with this group."" TIP-INS Kings: F Harry Giles III (sore left knee) was held out. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Early foul trouble in the season opener wasn't going to get Nikola Jokic down. He had 20 points and 13 rebounds despite sitting much of the first half, and the Denver Nuggets spoiled the first game of Portland's 50th season with a 108-100 victory over the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Will Barton added 19 points for the Nuggets, who also snapped Portland's 18-game winning streak in home openers, the longest streak in league history. Denver made 18 3-pointers. ""I didn't want to force it. I just wanted to win the game,"" said Jokic, who had 16 points in the fourth quarter alone. ""I wanted to go out there to be the positive energy to win the game."" Damian Lillard led the Blazers with 32 points and eight assists, and Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 19 rebounds in his Portland debut. Whiteside, acquired in an offseason trade with Miami, tipped in Lillard's 3-point attempt to help the Blazers to an 88-87 lead with just under five minutes left. But the Nuggets answered with consecutive baskets from Jokic and Gary Harris. Jokic hit back-to-back 3-pointers to extend Denver's lead to 97-90. Lillard landed a 3-pointer with 1:58 left to narrow the gap but the Blazers couldn't catch up. ""Nikola in the fourth quarter was phenomenal,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""I think he had 16 and 8 in the quarter. He showed everybody why he's an MVP-caliber player."" It was the first meeting between the teams since the Western Conference semifinals, won by the Blazers in seven games. ""When the game was being decided, we just had too many lapses on both ends of the floor,"" Lillard said. ""We put ourselves in a position where it was going to be hard to come back from them."" The Nuggets didn't make a lot of changes over the summer, returning the nucleus of the team that won 54 games last season and earned the West's second seed, ending a six-year postseason drought. The team's biggest move was acquiring Jerami Grant from Oklahoma City. Portland, meanwhile, has six new faces on the roster, including Whiteside, who started at center. The Blazers also picked up veteran big man Pau Gasol as they await Jusuf Nurkic's return from a broken leg. The Blazers finished 53-29 last season and clinched the West's third seed, playing through to the conference finals for the first time in 19 years. Jokic collected three early fouls and went to the bench with 8:15 left in the first quarter, and the Nuggets struggled. ""In the beginning of the game it brought out a lot of memories from last year's series,"" Jamal Murray said. ""We just wanted to come out and have a good game and come out with a win."" Rodney Hood hit a 3-pointer and made a free throw to give Portland a 19-7 lead. Lillard's first points of the game came on a dunk that made it 21-16. The Blazers closed to 70-69 on Lillard's 3-pointer late in the third quarter and then tied it on Anfernee Simons' free throw. But they didn't regain the lead until Simons' driving layup made it 74-73 and capped a 16-6 run going in to the final period. CJ McCollum's 3-pointer pushed the lead to 79-73 and Portland held on until Murray's 3 made it 83-all. Jokic's jumper gave Denver back the lead before Whiteside's tip. ""They had won 18 straight openers here so to come in here and win on the road against a division rival to start the year off I couldn't ask for a better start,"" Malone said. TIP INS Nuggets: Former Oregon center Bol Bol, the son of Manute Bol, warmed up with the Nuggets but was not available to play. A second-round pick, he signed to a two-way contract with the team. ... The 18 3-pointers were the team's most for an opener. ... Michael Porter Jr., the No. 14 draft pick in 2018 who sat out last season as he recovered from back surgery, did not play for the Nuggets. Trail Blazers: Gasol, who is still rehabbing from foot surgery, did not play. ... Lillard addressed the crowd before the game: ""Rip City! Rip City! We would like to welcome you to our 50th season, and hopefully our best."" ... The previous record for longest winning streak in home openers was 14, held by Boston from 1979-92. WHITESIDE'S DEBUT: Whiteside gave his debut mixed reviews, lamenting Jokic's late 3-pointers. ""We need to get the 3-point defense down,"" he said. ""They made some tough shots, but we can definitely get better at defending the 3.""","401160655"
"DETROIT --  Trae Young feels like a veteran as he enters his second NBA season. That'sbad news for the rest of the league. Young had 38 points and nine assists and the Atlanta Hawks opened the season with a 117-100 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night. ""I'm a lot more comfortable than I was at this point last year,"" Young said. ""Obviously, I'm not a rookie anymore and I felt great out there tonight. Once I hit a couple shots, I knew it was rolling."" If anyone at Little Caesars Arena doubted how good Young was feeling, he made it clear midway through the second quarter, hitting a 3-pointer from the edge of the Pistons logo at half court. ""I knew it was deep, but I didn't realize I was on the logo until someone told me at halftime,"" he said. ""Ever since high school, I've known when I was in range and let it go."" John Collins added 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Jabari Parker had 18 points. Vince Carter checked in for Atlanta with 6:52 left in the first quarter, becoming the first player to see action in 22 NBA seasons. ""Vince stabilizes this team,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Our starting lineup has about half as many years as he does, and we've got a bunch of guys who weren't even born when he started. He didn't have a basket tonight, but the boxscore can't show you everything he did to help us win."" Derrick Rose led Detroit with 27 points, and Andre Drummond had 21 points and 12 rebounds. Drummond had 32 points and 23 rebounds in Detroit's season-opening victory on Wednesday in Indiana, but the Hawks scored 60 points in the paint. ""I thought we came out tonight with a laissez-faire attitude defensively, and they took the game to us,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We had a good game last night, but that didn't mean a hill of beans tonight."" Drummond, who played 78 minutes in just over 24 hours, didn't think that was the problem. ""I really didn't have time to ease myself into the game, but this was just a tough night for us overall,"" he said. ""We're NBA players. There's no excuse for the way we started the game."" Young's four-point play with 3:43 left in the first half gave him 26 points -- the highest-scoring half of his career -- and put the Hawks up 58-51. Rose, though, scored 15 points in the half and Langston Galloway's late 3-pointer gave Detroit a 63-60 halftime lead. The teams stayed close for most of the quarter, but back-to-back dunks by Parker -- one over Thon Maker -- put Atlanta up 88-79. Parker added two free throws, giving him 18 points, and the Hawks took a 91-81 lead into the break. De'Andre Hunter's 3-pointer extended Atlanta's lead to 97-83 with 8:47 to play. Detroit scored the next four points before the game was delayed for several minutes because of the clock failure. The Pistons narrowed the lead to 98-92, but a pair of Rose turnovers helped the Hawks scored the next seven points and take a 13-point lead with 4:47 to play. Detroit got the margin to single digits, but Young's three-point play with 1:33 wrapped it up. TIP INS HAWKS: Carter has played 62 games against Detroit, second only to the 64 he has played against the Boston Celtics. Only 11 players have faced the Pistons more often since the NBA-ABA merger, led by Robert Parish with 90. PISTONS: PF Blake Griffin (hamstring/knee) is expected to miss three more games before being evaluated for a possible return. OLD-SCHOOL BASKETBALL The teams played without game and shot clocks for three minutes in the fourth period. The time remaining was announced at each stoppage in play and the shot clock was announced at 10 seconds and counted down from five. The clocks returned to the scoreboard for the final six minutes, but the boards above the baskets remained blank. ""That was disappointing -- I don't know what happened -- but it disrupts the flow of the game when you are looking around to see the clock,"" Casey said. INJURY UPDATE Reggie Jackson left early in the third quarter due to back tightness. Casey said he will be examined on Friday to see if he can face the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday.","401160656"
"HOUSTON --  When Giannis Antetokounmpo fouled out with more than five minutes left after putting up a triple-double against the Houston Rockets, the rest of the Milwaukee Bucks didn't panic. ""These guys in this locker room, we're fighters, we're competitors,"" Wesley Matthews said. ""If Giannis fouls out we can't just come into the locker room."" Antetokounmpo scored 30 points and his supporting cast held on to lead the Bucks to a 117-111 victory over the Rockets on Thursday night in a star-studded opener featuring the last three MVPs. Antetokounmpo, the MVP last season, also had 13 rebounds and 11 assists. While certainly upset after fouling out, he was impressed with the way his team responded. ""They did an amazing job,"" he said. ""Moving the ball, knocking down shots."" Brook Lopez made two free throws with about a minute left before a layup by Russell Westbrook. But Lopez made a fadeaway shot to leave Milwaukee up 115-109 with 39 seconds remaining. James Harden added a pair of free throws before Ersan Ilyasova made a jump shot with about 15 seconds to go that sent many fans heading to the exits. Some had wondered what would happen with the pairing of the two ball-dominant guards in Harden and Westbrook after the 2017 MVP was traded from Oklahoma City for Chris Paul this summer. In their first game together with the Rockets both filled up the stat sheet, but they were unable to come away with a win after leading for much of the game. Westbrook had 24 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists. Harden, the 2018 MVP, added 19 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds. He was 2 of 13 from the field, 1 of 8 on 3s and made 14 free throws without a miss. ""They're going to be fine,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It's sad to say, but we're not going to win 82 games this year. Now we've got a chance to win 81."" The Bucks led by six when Antetokounmpo fouled out. He walked to coach Mike Budenholzer and implored him to challenge the call, but he'd already used his one challenge per game that coaches get this season and couldn't do anything to help his superstar. Harden echoed his D'Antoni's sentiment and raved about Westbrook. ""Everybody saw it tonight,"" Harden said. ""He's a different type of breed on that court. But it's Game 1, we're not going to get too down, and even if we won, we're not going to get too excited."" Houston scored the next five points, with the last four from Westbrook to cut the lead to 101-100. But Khris Middleton hit a 3-pointer with 3 1/2 minutes left to stretch Milwaukee's lead. The Bucks were up by six with about two minutes left before P.J. Tucker knocked a 3 from the corner. But Matthews added a 3-pointer for Milwaukee seconds after that to push the lead to 111-105. Milwaukee opened the fourth quarter with a 13-3 run to make it 91-90 and take its first lead of the night. Antetokounmpo led the way in stretch, scoring eight points. The Rockets missed several shots and had a turnover before they finally got back on track. There were about eight minutes left when Harden found Westbrook connected on two straight plays. On the first one Harden dished to Westbrook and he was fouled on a layup to get a 3-point play. The next time down the court Harden sent a bounce pass to Westbrook in the lane and he finished with a two-handed dunk that put Houston up 95-91 and brought a huge ovation from the crowd. But the Bucks made the next 10 points, led by five from Brook Lopez, who capped the run with a 3-pointer to make it 101-95 with about 5 1/2 minutes left. TIP-INS Bucks: Lopez had 14 points and four rebounds. ... Ilyasova had13 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. ... Milwaukee made 16 of 46 3-pointers. Rockets: Tucker had 17 points and made five 3-pointers. ... Houston also made 16 3-pointers. ... Clint Capela had 13 points and 12 rebounds. NBA/CHINA RELATIONSHIP A group of 30 fans held signs and wore shirts in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong at the game. Houston general manager Daryl Morey angered China with a since-deleted tweet in support of the protesters earlier this month. Wednesday's opening-night games were not televised in China in the wake of Morey's tweet that caused tension between the NBA and Chinese officials. One man held a sign the read: ""Thank you Morey,"" with a red heart after Morey's name. Another sign read: ""No censorship in America"" and a third declared: ""Freedom is not FREE."" Another man held a sign that said: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,"" which are the exact words included in Morey's tweet.","401160657"
"Draymond Green claims he's not into moral victories and blasts the Warriors' execution in their opening-night loss to the Clippers. (0:36) SAN FRANCISCO --  Kawhi Leonard sure knows how to spoil Golden State's fun. Leonard did it again in the Warriors' first game at Chase Center just like in their farewell at Oracle Arena four months ago, scoring 21 points in three quarters to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 141-122 victory Thursday on opening night at Golden State's snazzy new arena. Reigning NBA Finals MVP Leonard shot 9 for 17 and also dished out nine assists in his second game with L.A. after leading the Toronto Raptors to their first title last season in a six-game finals against the Warriors. ""I thought he started doing it in the second round last year,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""In the first round he was just dominating and then I thought as each round went on he started playmaking more and more, but what he's doing now is on another level."" Stephen Curry scored 23 points but committed eight turnovers and D'Angelo Russell added 20 points in his Golden State debut, but the Warriors got beat up the way they used to do it against the entire NBA -- even giving up a 46-point third quarter. ""They hit us with our typical third quarter type of vibe,"" Curry said. What a dud for the Dubs as they formally opened new Chase Center in San Francisco after 47 years at Oracle Arena in Oakland. Patrick Patterson scored 20 points and Ivica Zubac had 16 points, 10 rebounds and two blocked shots for Los Angeles. In a rematch of the hard-fought first-round playoff series last season won by the Warriors in six games on their way to a fifth straight finals, the Clippers jumped to a 14-0 lead making 5 of their first 6 shots. Golden State started 0 for 6 and missed four 3s. Russell's jumper at 8:23 gave Golden State its first points and he scored the Warriors' initial seven before Curry hit a 3 at 6:42. The Warriors got a scare when they briefly lost Draymond Green at the 9:03 mark of the opening quarter after he injured his right elbow on a screen, and it was sore all night because of a nerve issue. Green returned to the court at the start of the second and wound up with 11 points. Curry, who at 31 is the oldest Warriors player, was 2 of 11 on 3s as new-look Golden State went 15 for 42 from deep. Kevin Durant is long gone and so are several other key veterans part of the recent Warriors championship runs. ""I'm sure the film session tomorrow won't be pretty,"" Curry said. Golden State coach Steve Kerr is embracing the move and new arena -- he's still figuring his way around the building -- but noted ""I'll miss everything about Oracle. It's a great place to play."" Some fans left after the third quarter with the home team trailing 111-87. There will be plenty more lumps along the way for this young group, with Kerr noting, ""This is not a one off."" ""This is more the reality of the NBA. The last five years we've been living in a world that isn't supposed to exist,"" Kerr said. Leonard and Patrick Beverley were booed during pregame introductions for the Clippers, who beat the Lakers 112-102 in their opener Tuesday with Leonard scoring 30 points on 10-for-19 shooting. TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles shot 56.8% in the first half (21 of 37), making 6 of 11 3s. ... The Clippers were outrebounded 23-20 in the first half and 42-39 overall. ... G Rodney McGruder missed his second straight game with a high right ankle sprain. ... The Clippers scored 58 points in the paint. Warriors: Golden State called a late timeout when it had none remaining, resulting in a technical foul. ... Kevon Looney started at center for the Warriors after working back from a strained right hamstring then dealt with right hamstring tightness in the second half and didn't return as a precautionary move. The hope had been he would play about 20 minutes with four stretches of five minutes or so, Kerr said. ... Kerr challenged a foul call on Looney late in the first half and the call was upheld. ... The Warriors had won the last three at home against the Clippers. NICE TOUCHES Newly enshrined Hall of Famer Al Attles, who will be 83 next month, took part in a ceremonial tipoff just before the ball actually went up. Attles joined the organization in 1960 and played in the Philadelphia Warriors in Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game on March 2, 1962. Injured Splash Brother Klay Thompson, who could miss the entire season recovering from surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee, spoke to the fans at midcourt before the game. He also shared a hug and a few words with Leonard. Construction workers who built Chase Center held the flag for the national anthem. LOCKED OUT Kerr joked he might need to wear his key card around his neck even on game nights. ""I've been locked out of my office a couple times after games, true story,"" he said. ""... We're slowly but surely figuring those things out."" QUOTEABLE Rivers hardly considers Curry past his prime beginning his 11th NBA season. ""I want him to get older. I'm all for the 40 Steph, I can't wait for that one,"" Rivers quipped. ""He'll still be playing because he can shoot. He just won't be as agile I don't think. He's been around a long time. It's amazing when you think about it how quickly it goes.""","401160658"
"BOSTON --  Kemba Walker said he wants to earn the role of being a leader with the Celtics this season. He didn't mind following his teammates in Boston's win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night. Walker recovered from a second straight poor shooting start to score 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and help the Celtics rally to beat the defending NBA champions 112-106. Jaylen Brown had 25 points, including a key 3-pointer in the closing minutes. Jayson Tatum finished with 25 points and nine rebounds. Walker said support from his teammates helped him shake off a 0-for-5 start from the field just two days removed from his  4 for 18 performance in Boston's season-opening loss to Philadelphia. ""That's what I needed,"" Walker said. ""The things that they said to me are the things that I needed to hear. They seen my face, kind of down at times. They just kept encouraging me."" The Celtics shot only 38%, but it wasn't for a lack of trying. They had 109 attempts in the game. Pascal Siakam scored 33 points and had eight rebounds to lead the Raptors, who went 18 of 36 from the 3-point line.  Kyle Lowry finished with 29 points, including six 3-pointers.  But the pair also had nine turnovers between them. Siakam said teams are playing him differently through two games. ""There's more help, obviously,"" he said. ""Last year, I felt like I was always out there on the side just working. Now there's a little more intention."" There were 12 ties and 19 lead changes, with neither team holding more than a seven-point lead. Boston found its shot in the fourth quarter, outscoring Toronto 36-24. One of the plays that got the Celtics going came with 5:43 to play. Brown corralled a Marc Gasol miss, took two dribbles and threaded a half-court bounce pass between three Raptors defenders to a cutting Gordon Hayward for a layup to give the Celtics a 99-98 lead. ""I have definitely been working on that side of my game, being a playmaker and making plays for others,"" Brown said. ""Hopefully there will be a lot more passes like that coming soon."" Later, the Celtics were leading 107-106 when Brown hit a 3-pointer with 2:49 to play. O.G. Anunoby was called for a charge on Walker with 1:26 left, which was challenged by the Raptors. But after a review, the call was upheld. Boston got a shot-clock violation on its next trip down the floor, but Lowry turned it over on Toronto's ensuing possession when his one-handed pass along the baseline sailed out of bounds with 45 seconds remaining. The Celtics closed out the final 9:07 of regulation on a 30-17 run. Coming off a 34-point game in Toronto's season-opening win over New Orleans on Tuesday, Siakam also started slow. He missed his first four shots and was scoreless in the first period before he got a finger roll to fall just before halftime. TIP-INS Raptors: Hollis-Jefferson and McCaw (sore right knee) sat for the second straight game, but Nurse said one or both could be ready to go on Saturday. Celtics: Daniel Theis left the game in the second quarter with a sprained left ankle, but returned in the third period. . Enes Kanter (left knee contusion) Tacko Fall (concussion protocol) and Romeo Langford (sore right knee) were both inactive. CHALLENGE Celtics coach Brad Stevens is 1-0 in using the coach's challenge this season. He successfully challenged a foul called on Williams as he contested a 3-point attempt by Gasol from the corner with 0.3 seconds. Replay appeared to show Williams whiff on his contest of Gasol's attempt. The NBA Replay Center agreed, prompting a jump ball. ""Exhilarating,"" Stevens said of winning the challenge. ROTATING BIG MEN Stevens said they will likely have a rotating center spot early throughout this season. Even before Enes Kanter was injured in the opener, he said the expectation was for the center position to often vary by opponent. ""We'll see how we go, night to night, who is the best option to look at,"" Stevens said. Theis started Friday and played 14 minutes. Robert Williams III logged 14 minutes off the bench.","401160659"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Karl-Anthony Towns took advantage of an obvious mismatch Friday night when Charlotte center Cody Zeller wasn't there to defend him. Towns had 37 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, and the Minnesota Timberwolves remained unbeaten with a 121-99 win over the Hornets. Without Zeller, who missed the game due to undisclosed personal reasons, the Hornets were forced to turn to Bismack Biyombo and Willy Hernangomez to defend the two-time All-Star. Towns took full advantage, finishing 13 of 18 from the field while using his big frame create space inside. He also drained four 3-pointers. Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said he wants his team working on a balanced inside-outside attack, but admitted ""the fact that there was not a defender like Cody Zeller on the court tonight -- and obviously our prayers are with him -- we went inside a little more."" Andrew Wiggins added 16 points for Minnesota, which outscored Charlotte 45-25 in the third quarter to break open a two-point game. Towns said he felt like he needed to take control when the Timberwolves fell behind 12-2 after missing 7 of 8 shots to open the game. ""That's where I have to do my job and get people buckets and get us going by drawing a lot of attention and making the right pass,"" Towns said. Said Minnesota guard Josh Okogie: ""This was a regular night for KAT. I definitely know that he can definitely do more, so I'm definitely excited to see what he can do this season."" Saunders said his team's defense fueled the offense in the decisive third quarter. ""We feel confident that even when we're missing shots, we were generating good looks and we just needed some to fall, but really our defense fueled our offense,"" Saunders said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Outrebounded the Hornets 52-42. ... Shabazz Napier had nine assists. Hornets: Rookie PJ Washington, who had 27 points on seven 3s in Charlotte's season opener, had 10 points and 10 rebounds.. ... Nic Batum said he will miss at least three weeks with a broken finger. IMPRESSIVE START Hornets backup guard Devonte Graham continued his torrid start to the season, finishing with a team-high 24 points on 6-of-9 shooting from 3-point range. Graham is shooting 75% (12 of 16) from deep in two games. ""His confidence, he's impressive,"" Saunders said. ""I was telling a few our assistants on the bench that they way he is shooting the ball and the way he is rising up, with that rhythm -- he's definitely got a future."" Graham played nearly 28 minutes, while starting point guard Terry Rozier played just 17. TURNOVER CENTRAL Minnesota turned 20 Charlotte turnovers into 21 points. The Hornets, who played eight players with less than three years of NBA experience, have now turned the ball over 39 times in two games. ""We're gonna get smacked in the mouth a few times, it's how you respond,"" said Hornets coach James Borrego. HONORING THEIR COACH Members of the Timberwolves presented their head coach with a game ball and the assistant coaches gave him a large sheet cake to help honor the memory of his father, Flip Saunders, who died on this day four years ago. ""The motto is `us,' and when someone feels something and is having a moment, we want to be helpful in that moment,"" Towns said. ""We thought it was very important as a team. Me personally, I got our guys understanding how important this game is, four years from the day, we've got to win this for him. We've got to take care of our leader."" Cake was one of Flip Saunders' favorites. ""I know he's smiling,"" Towns said. ""His son's doing really well, a tremendous job.""","401160660"
"NEW YORK --  The Knicks had the momentum on the court and their fans cheering wildly in the stands. The Nets have Kyrie Irving. He's the main reason that for now, all roads -- and bridges and tunnels -- point Brooklyn's way in New York's basketball rivalry. Irving scored 26 points and made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 22 seconds left after the Knicks had taken a late lead, and the Nets held on for a 113-109 victory Friday night in the first meeting this season between New York's teams. ""Having a player like that, where you know that he can make plays down the stretch, it gives the team a lot of confidence,"" Nets forward Joe Harris said. ""I don't think any one of us, when the Knicks got up by three there with a like a minute and a half to go, I don't think any of us were worried."" The Nets controlled much of the game and then responded just in time after the Knicks had surged ahead with a big fourth quarter. Irving, who scored 50 points in an overtime loss in his Brooklyn debut, scored five straight points down the stretch after New York took a three-point lead. Spencer Dinwiddie added 20 points. Allonzo Trier scored 22 points for the Knicks, who fell to 0-2. Rookie RJ Barrett and Kevin Knox II each added 16. Nets fans hoping to see the first victory for their new-look team had to wait through an anxious fourth quarter, when the blue-shirted fans in the building started making plenty of noise after the Knicks came back from 19 points down. Wayne Ellington's 3-pointer capped a run of 10 straight points that tied it at 104. Irving made a layup, but then Ellington hit another 3 and Barrett stole Irving's pass and made a layup, making it a 15-2 run and giving New York a 109-106 lead with 3:41 to play. ""So I just had to bring the guys, tell them to calm down,"" Irving said. ""We just had to get three solid possessions offensively and defensively, and down the stretch I feel like we made some big-time plays."" Irving then hit a jumper and a step-back 3-pointer from the right wing that was reminiscent of his game-winning 3 in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals for Cleveland. ""He's a great player. A champion. Great players make great plays and that's what he did tonight,"" Barrett said. ""Same shot he hit to win the championship against Golden State."" The Knicks had a chance to tie but Julius Randle lost the ball on a spin move under the basket and Dinwiddie closed it out with two free throws. The Nets have been in New York since 2012, but this is the first time they clearly have the bigger share of the city's basketball buzz. Kevin Durant and Irving committed to come to Brooklyn in the opening hours of free agency, and the Knicks weren't able to get an All-Star, even though they had enough salary cap space to sign two of them. The Nets gave away Irving jerseys -- which some people took as an attempt to taunt the Knicks. There was certainly plenty of Brooklyn black inside Barclays Center, which often seems split more evenly and where Knicks fans have made plenty of noise in the past during better times. This time, when the Knicks came out to warm up they were greeted with chants of ""We got Kyrie! We got Kyrie!"" and ""Where is Zion?"" ""Where is Zion?"" -- a reminder that the Knicks didn't make the biggest score in free agency or the draft, where they ended up with the No. 3 pick and missed a chance to draft Zion Williamson. TIP-INS Knicks: Randle was just 5 for 15 and finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. ... Mitchell Robinson started at center after missing the opener with a sprained right ankle. He had six points and seven rebounds. Nets: DeAndre Jordan, who signed along with Durant and Irving, had seven points and 11 rebounds after finishing with just two points and three rebounds in his debut. ... Harris scored 13 points. SECOND-QUARTER SCUFFLE Bobby Portis and Taurean Prince were given second-quarter technical fouls after a brief scrum. Randle leaped to stop a drive by Irving, who landed on the court with the ball in his hands. He refused to let go as Portis tried to rip it out of his hands -- all but lifting Irving off the court in his attempts -- and Prince ran over to pull Portis away from Irving before other players rushed in. BRONX CHEER Aaron Judge and CC Sabathia were in the crowd and both received loud ovations when they were shown on the overhead board. Fans stood and cheered for Sabathia, who injured his shoulder in the American League Championship Series in his final outing before retiring.","401160661"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Zach LaVine may have led Chicago scorers, but it was rookie Coby White who sparked the Bulls' comeback. LaVine had 37 points, and White, the seventh pick in last summer's NBA Draft, scored 21 of his 25 points in the second half as the Bulls rallied to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 110-102 on Friday night. ""I told ya'll from the jump, I knew how good he was going to be,"" LaVine said when asked about White. ""He's going to continue to get better."" Memphis built a first-half lead to 14 points before holding a 60-47 advantage at the break. At that point, White had a mere four points. The North Carolina product's 21 second-half points included 8 of 11 from the field and 4 of 6 from outside the arc. ""It was a team win,"" the rookie said. ""I was just one little piece of it. We got it done as a team. ... I was just doing what I can to create some type of spark."" Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 23 points and 11 rebounds, while rookie Brandon Clarke had 14 points, missing only two of nine shots. Grizziles rookie Ja Morant, the No. 2 pick in the draft, and Jonas Valanciunas added 10 points apiece. Valanciunas grabbed 13 rebounds. The Bulls turned up the defense to start the second half, cutting into the Grizzlies' lead as Memphis missed its first six shots. White would end up playing the entire fourth quarter as the Grizzlies saw their lead slip away. ""I wasn't taking him out,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said of White. The Bulls caught Memphis with about four minutes left on a 3-pointer from White. After the teams exchanged leads, Chicago pulled ahead for good when LaVine scored on a drive with 1:31 left, part of a 12-1 Bulls closing run. The loss marked the second time in the first two games in which Memphis squandered a lead it held entering the fourth quarter -- perhaps a sign of a young team. ""We kind of got away from what we needed to be doing offensively in the third quarter,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""We have to learn from how the first half is more indicative of what we have to be offensively and defensively. Then we have to get better in the third and fourth quarter."" TIP-INS Bulls: Have won five straight in the series -- the longest victory stretch over the Grizzlies since Chicago won the first seven games after the franchise started in Vancouver. ... Lauri Markkanen made only one of eight shots in the first half, including missing six from outside the arc. He finished 4 of 15 from the field, scoring nine points. ... White scored 10 points in the third quarter to start the Bulls' comeback. Grizzlies: Play five of their next six games at home. The lone road game is at Los Angeles against the Lakers next Tuesday. ... The loss snapped a streak of three straight home-opening wins. ... An indication of the new faces on the Grizzlies, swingman Dillon Brooks is the longest-tenured Memphis player entering his third year. ... Valanciunas earned the Grizzlies first home technical of the year, debating a no-call in the second quarter. ... Morant, who had six turnovers in the season-opening loss to Miami, committed four against the Bulls. He has nine assists to 10 turnovers in his first two games. MANAGING OTTO Before the game, Chicago coach Jim Boylen indicated forward Otto Porter Jr. would play less than 24 minutes as the Bulls manage his time. Chicago plays their first back-to-back of the season on Saturday against Toronto. ""We'll manger him appropriately to play (Saturday), and then we will evaluate him after the game if he does play (against Toronto),"" Boylen said. Porter played just more than 21 minutes.

"NEW ORLEANS --  As he watched his late, rainbow 3-pointer drop in off the glass, Luka Doncic skipped backward toward the defensive end for the Dallas Mavericks with a snarl on his face and clenched fists lowered near each hip. ""He makes those shots. He's wild,"" teammate Kristaps Porzingis said. ""At the end of the game, he was really clutch."" Doncic highlighted his triple-double by scoring eight of his 25 points in the final five minutes, and the Mavericks topped New Orleans 123-116 in the Pelicans' home opener Friday night. Doncic also had 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while Porzingis added 24 points and five blocks to help Dallas start 2-0 for the first time since the 2004-05 season. ""Everybody's happy after this win, but it's just the start,"" Doncic said, adding he wants to see the Mavs in the playoff hunt come April. ""We've got to keep it going."" Delon Wright scored 18 points, effectively finding close-range shots with decisive cuts and drives to the hoop, and highlighted a strong defensive outing with a late steal. ""He played an amazing game,"" Doncic said. ""He was the key to our win."" Brandon Ingram led New Orleans with 25 points after scoring 22 in a loss at defending NBA champion Toronto in overtime to open the season Tuesday night. The game was tied at 109 after Ingram's jumper with about five minutes left, but Doncic responded with a jumper while being fouled by Jrue Holiday to start a six-point mini-run capped by Jalen Brunson's turnaround near the baseline that made it 115-109. New Orleans missed five straight 3-pointers before Ingram finally hit one to make it 115-112. Doncic's right-handed runner in the lane over a crowd of defenders, followed by his left wing 3 off the glass with 1:23 left, made it 120-113, and the Pelicans couldn't recover. ""That's him,"" Porzingis said of Doncic. ""He loves those moments. I love those moments. And we're going to try to be dangerous there at the end."" Derrick Favors and Josh Hart each had 16 points for the Pelicans. Lonzo Ball added 15. Holiday, however, labored through an uncharacteristically rough shooting night, going just 2 of 11 from the field. ""I feel like we go through this every year, especially with me, but it's just timing -- new lineups, new situations, new team,"" Holiday said. ""There's always a positive. Last two games, we were in it at the end, so we'll just go back to the film and see what we can do."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Brunson finished with 14 points and Maxi Kleber grabbed 10 rebounds. ... Dwight Powell, who plays center and forward, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. ... Coach Rick Carlisle lost a replay challenge of an officials' decision that Wright committed a blocking foul on Hart's fourth-quarter pull-up that cut the Mavs' lead to 103-101. ... Dallas went 14 of 40 from 3-point range but shot 48.4 percent (45 of 93) overall. Pelicans: Reserve guard Frank Jackson scored 10 points in just 14:47. ... New Orleans finished 15 of 41 from 3-point range, with Ball missing nine of 12 and Hart missing four of five. ... Coach Alvin Gentry rotated 11 players into the game and 10 of them played at least 14 minutes. In New Orleans' opener at Toronto, 12 players got in the game, each playing at least 13 minutes. SECOND-QUARTER SURGE New Orleans led by 16 early and double digits for much of the first half. The Pelicans went up 53-40 on Nickeil Alexander-Walker's 3 in the second quarter, but Dallas outscored New Orleans 32-11 during the final eight minutes of the half, and Porzingis said it started with Dallas' defense. ""I told everybody we're going to step it up. We're going to put it in a different gear defensively,"" Porzingis said. ""We got out there with more energy, with more intensity, more vocal. ... That got us going."" Wright and Doncic each scored eight during that surge, which was ignited by Doncic's step-back 3. Soon after, Porzingis, who had 17 first-half points, added a dunk, a 3 and free throws on successive possessions to make it 55-50. Tim Hardaway Jr.'s 3 put Dallas ahead 72-64 at halftime. DELAYED DEBUT Top draft pick Zion Williamson, coming off arthroscopic surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee, was on the court for introductions in street clothes, using a crutch. He is expected to be out six to eight weeks, meaning the Pelicans could be 20-plus games into the season before he plays.","401160663"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The crowd was fired up after Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's jumper capped a rally and tied it in the closing minutes against the Washington Wizards. The new-look Oklahoma City Thunder, in their first home game since trading away All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George in the offseason, seemed prepared to give their fans some hope. The Wizards, unfazed, responded with a 14-0 run and beat Oklahoma City 97-85 on Friday night. ""I told the guys that's why the fans are going to fall in love with our team -- because we give a lot of incredible effort,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""I mean, it's maximum effort every time on the court, and some of the time, you don't know what's going to happen."" Thomas Bryant had 21 points and 11 rebounds, rookie forward Rui Hachimura scored 19 points and Bradley Beal added 17 for Washington. Oklahoma City shot just under 40 percent, made just 14 of 22 free throws and had 19 turnovers. Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 28 points and Danilo Gallinari added 18 for the Thunder. Point guard Chris Paul, who scored six points in 30 minutes and had four assists and five turnovers, blamed himself for the loss. ""If I would have contributed at all we would have won the game, and that's something, and you can't sugar coat it,"" he said. The Wizards led 52-46 at halftime, then scored the first six points of the second half. The Wizards led 78-70 at the end of the third quarter. The Thunder held the Wizards scoreless for the first 4 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter to tighten the game. Gilgeous-Alexander's mid-range jumper tied it at 83 with 4:26 to play. Washington responded quickly. A 3-pointer by Davis Bertans put the Wizards up by five, and a layup by Beal forced a Thunder timeout. The Thunder made just one more basket the rest of the way, and that came with 20.9 seconds remaining. Brooks said Washington is improving because the team's young players have the right attitude. ""It's hard to teach when you have students who aren't interested in learning,"" Brooks said. ""I love the group that we have. We want to get better, and that's a coach's dream."" TIP-INS Wizards: G Jordan McRae sat out with a finger injury. He played 23 minutes in the opener against Dallas. ... Ish Smith, who had a short stint with the Thunder, started the game and finished with four points and five assists. ... Beal made 4 of 17 shots the first three quarters but 3 of 5 in the fourth.

He's averaging 12.5 rebounds, but his offensive struggles have hurt a team that has been in two close games to start the season. QUOTABLE Adams, talking about a Thunder team that has three new starters since last season: ""Just chemistry, mate. Just chemistry, get a bit more flow. It's just constantly building. This stuff ain't easy."" Paul took a different approach. ""It's the NBA, we are all pros,"" he said. ""You can't be taking time and losing games.""","401160664"
"DENVER --  This was Jamal Murray's overriding emotion after watching his teammate block a last-second shot to preserve the win, after seeing another teammate called for a foul on a half-court shot to send the game into overtime and after his clutch baskets in the closing moments: ""Tired,"" the point guard said. A fitting feeling following such a crazy contest. Murray scored seven of his 27 points in OT and the Denver Nuggets regrouped to beat the Phoenix Suns 108-107 in their home opener Friday night after Ricky Rubio tied the game late in regulation when he was fouled on a half-court shot. ""It was definitely a game of different emotions,"" Torrey Craig said. The final emotion? Relief. Murray hit two free throws with 19.4 seconds remaining in overtime to give the Nuggets the lead. Devin Booker took a last-second shot for Phoenix, but Craig glided over from the opposite side to get a hand on the jumper. ""Sometimes you need games like that,"" said Craig, who had four blocked shots. ""You can learn from it."" Nikola Jokic finished with 23 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists to help the Nuggets escape after leading by nine with 3:10 remaining in the fourth. Rubio extended the game in improbable fashion when he dribbled up the court and launched a 3-pointer as Malik Beasley grabbed his arm with 1.8 seconds remaining in regulation. He made all three free throws. ""Just an immature play by me. I've got to learn time and score,"" Beasley said. ""We still pulled it out and still made great plays."" In overtime, Murray took control. His game-winning free throws came soon after Gary Harris swatted the ball away from Frank Kaminsky down low. Rubio, Aron Baynes and Kelly Oubre Jr. all fouled out in OT. Oubre led the team with 23 points. ""We fought hard all night,"" Booker said. ""Couple of things we need to clean up on, but we faced adversity tonight and we responded well to it."" Especially at the line, where the Suns went a combined 31 of 32. Kaminsky was 11 of 11, Rubio 7 of 7 and Oubre 6 of 6. ""If we keep playing like that it's going to be a good season,"" Rubio said. Before Beasley's unnecessary foul, he was having quite a fourth quarter -- scoring eight straight points for Denver during a critical stretch. Jerami Grant also came up big in the fourth with a crowd-energizing, one-handed dunk off a missed 3-pointer. The Nuggets have improved in each season under coach Michael Malone, going from 33 wins his first season to 40, 46 and 54 last season when the team earned the No. 2 overall seed in the West. A big reason for their success was an NBA-best 34-7 mark at home in 2018-19. Malone has challenged them to improve that record. ""Let's hold ourselves to an even higher standard,"" he said. Suns big man Deandre Ayton missed the first of 25 games after being suspended Thursday for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program after testing positive for a diuretic. Baynes had 15 points in place of the second-year center. ""We know things are going to happen, so when your name's called up you've got to perform,"" Rubio said. TIP-INS Suns: F Cameron Johnson missed a second straight game with left calf soreness. ""He's close,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ... Kaminsky had 19 points and 11 boards. Nuggets: Denver had 12 blocked shots. ... Denver was misfiring from long range all game after making 18 3-pointers in a season-opening win at Portland. The team was 7 of 27 against Phoenix.  ... Trailing by as many as 14 points, the Nuggets took their first lead of the game, 57-55, on Jokic's three-point play at 4:16 of the third quarter. LOCAL AIRING Altitude TV purchased air time with a local station to broadcast the Nuggets home opener. Altitude Sports remains in negotiation with three former Altitude cable and satellite carriers -- Comcast, DIRECTV and DISH Network. The companies have dropped Altitude from its lineups. Altitude also broadcasts the Colorado Avalanche. TIGHT RELATIONSHIP Williams holds Malone in high esteem. The feeling is mutual. Malone was a member of Williams' staff in 2010-11 when Williams was the head coach in New Orleans. Malone remembers an important lesson Williams imparted -- family first. ""He was kicking me out of office, telling me to go home,"" Malone recalled. ""He understood the importance of family.""","401160665"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  As he watched Damian Lillard take over in the fourth quarter, Hassan Whiteside stood up from his spot on Portland's bench and began pointing to his wrist. Having seen Lillard repeatedly burn teams with late shots while playing against him, Whiteside knew his new teammate was ready to do it once again. Lillard scored 13 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter and the Trail Blazers pulled away to beat the Sacramento Kings 122-112 on Friday night. ""I knew what time it was,"" Whiteside said. ""I think everybody knew what time it was."" Lillard added five assists and five rebounds, Whiteside had 22 points and nine rebounds despite sitting out the entire fourth period, and C.J. McCollum scored 19. ""In the first half we didn't think we played well at all,"" Lillard said. ""We were able to come out and assert ourselves starting the third quarter and pretty much controlled the game through the finish."" Portland (1-1) overcame a sluggish first half but couldn't shake Sacramento until Lillard took over midway through the fourth. The All-Star point guard weaved through the Kings defense for an uncontested layup, then nailed back-to-back 3-pointers, including one from 31 feet, and a pair of free throws to make it 114-101. Hield hit a 3-pointer for the Kings but McCollum scored on consecutive trips down the floor and Lillard added his third 3 of the quarter. It was nothing new to Whiteside. He's seen it all before from both Lillard and McCollum. The only difference now is Whiteside's vantage point. ""That's part of the reason I was so excited coming here,"" Whiteside said. ""I knew what it was. I've guarded it. Being out there with those guys means a lot."" Blazers coach Terry Stotts credited his team's defense for making the difference. ""That was a really challenging game,"" Stotts said. ""Sacramento plays a style that's really tough to guard. We made most of our runs when we defended well."" De'Aaron Fox had 28 points, five assists and six rebounds for Sacramento. Buddy Hield added 21 points but the Kings remained winless in two games under new coach Luke Walton. ""We need to be able to get stops, and tonight we were not able to,"" Walton said. ""I actually thought we had some nice strides toward the end of the preseason with our defense but it has unfortunately not carried over into the regular season."" Anfernee Simons added 15 points off the bench for Portland. Sacramento controlled most of the first half and led by seven late in the second quarter before Portland closed on a 12-5 run. McCollum fueled the surge with a steal, dunk and short floater, and Lillard made a step-back 22-footer over Fox to tie it at 57. RESTING HASSAN Stotts rested Whiteside in the fourth quarter after the big man logged 26 minutes in the first three periods. Whiteside also played 26 minutes in the opener against Denver. It helped that Sacramento's two centers, Dewayne Dedmon and Richaun Holmes, were in foul trouble, forcing the Kings to go with a smaller lineup. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard picked up two fouls in a five-second span early in the first quarter. ... Simons scored 10 points in the second quarter after being held to five on 2-of-7 shooting in the season-opening loss to Denver. Kings: Marvin Bagley III, who broke his right thumb in the opening loss at Phoenix, did not play and is expected to miss four-to-six weeks. Harry Giles (left knee soreness) also was held out. WEBBER, WALTON ON HAND Chris Webber attended the game and sat courtside next to Kings owner Vivek Ranadive. Webber, a four-time All-Star with Sacramento and one of the most popular players in franchise history, was greeted with a loud ovation from the Golden 1 Center crowd. Former Blazers star Bill Walton, the father of Sacramento's coach, was also in attendance wearing a purple Kings shirt.","401160666"
"LOS ANGELES --  Less than 90 seconds into the game, Anthony Davis leaped and slammed home an alley-oop pass from LeBron James for the first points of his home debut with the Los Angeles Lakers. By the final 90 seconds, Davis and James were enjoying a blowout win from the bench. It's only a start, but it's exactly what the Lakers had in mind when these two superstars elected to team up in Hollywood. Davis had 21 points and seven rebounds in his first home game with the Lakers, and James delivered 32 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds Friday night during Los Angeles' 95-86 victory over the Utah Jazz. Troy Daniels hit four 3-pointers and scored 15 points for the Lakers, who were impressive in unveiling their revamped lineup. Along with the offensive fireworks expected from a team boasting Davis and James, Los Angeles forced 23 turnovers by a talented Utah squad and won comfortably behind that gritty defense. ""We are the real deal defensively,"" Davis said. ""We try to lay our hats on defense. We want to be a defensive-oriented team, and guys came in and were pesky today."" Davis had already played in a regular-season game at Staples Center in a Lakers uniform while getting wildly cheered -- but that happened three days earlier during the Lakers' loss in the Clippers' home opener. The star big man is still looking for his flow, but he blocked five shots and contributed steadily on offense. James was aggressive throughout the final three quarters, bulling his way to the hoop and sliding away from defenders in another impressive two-way game. ""He was just locked in and had a really good night in both halves, but particularly in the second half,"" Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points for the Jazz, who played without injured newcomer Bojan Bogdanovic. Utah has committed 34 turnovers in its first two games. Jeff Green had five points while starting in place of Bogdanovic, Utah's $73 million free agent acquisition. The Jazz beat Oklahoma City in their opener, but didn't have enough offense to compete with the new-look Lakers and their solid defensive schemes. ""We were talking about our offense all preseason and how it was good, and our defense was bad,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Now our offense hasn't been good. ... There's a part of it that you're getting connected and things like that, but there's also part of it where we just need to be stronger with the ball. We need to be more decisive. We need to be more precise."" The Lakers never trailed after the opening minutes, and they took firm control with a strong third quarter featuring 12 points from James and three 3-pointers from Daniels, the proficient outside shooter acquired specifically to knock down spot-up 3s. Los Angeles opened the third quarter with a small lineup using Davis as its center to minimize the defensive impact of Utah big man Rudy Gobert, and it worked splendidly. ""You've got to give credit to the Lakers, too,"" said Mike Conley, who had 13 points on 3-of-11 shooting. ""They defended us the way they wanted to, but a lot of it is us learning each other. Us learning guys. Who's handling the ball? Who's running? Who's in different lanes?"" DWIGHT RETURNS Dwight Howard heard a few boos when he checked in for his first home game back with the Lakers, whom he spurned in free agency in 2013 after one tumultuous season. He had been booed relentlessly for six years since -- but in his return as Los Angeles' backup center, Howard played a strong defensive game and earned cheers by the second half with his obvious effort. DANNY SPEAKS Danny Green had nine points after scoring 28 against the Clippers in his Lakers debut earlier this week. The veteran who won a ring with Toronto last season also took the microphone before the game and told cheering fans: ""I promise we'll do better than last year."" TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic sat out after rolling his left ankle in Utah's season opener Wednesday. He returned in the second half of that win over Oklahoma City, scoring nine of his 16 points on a bad ankle. ... Joe Ingles started and scored just two points after Royce O'Neale started the opener. Lakers: G Rajon Rondo missed his second straight game with a sore right calf. He will return soon, and F Kyle Kuzma will be right behind him. Kuzma didn't participate in training camp while recovering from a left ankle injury incurred during the summer, but he is participating in 4-on-4 drills and other activities.","401160667"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks had a 21-point lead in the third quarter at home and lost. That's not what good teams do, and Giannis Antetokounmpo knows it. Goran Dragic scored 25 points off the bench, Bam Adebayo added 19 points and 13 rebounds, and the Miami Heat rallied to beat Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in overtime 131-126 on Saturday night. Antetokounmpo finished with 29 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists, but last season's MVP also had eight turnovers and fouled out with 2:31 to play in overtime. Antetokounmpo also fouled out Thursday night in Houston. ""Obviously, we've got to learn from tonight's game,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We were up 21 and we allowed them to come back into the game. We cannot let that happen. Good teams don't let that happen. Definitely, we're going to learn from this."" After trailing 74-53 with less than 11:00 to play in the third quarter, the Heat outscored Milwaukee 78-52 the rest of the way, including 49-33 in the fourth quarter and overtime. ""A tremendous amount of perseverance and guts,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. ""Our guys made some really big-time plays in the second half. Our level of intensity, urgency went up. If you are going to try to beat one of these teams on their home floor, you are going to have to play a lot harder than we did in the first half. It was one inspiring play after another."" Duncan Robinson hit a 3-pointer for the Heat to tie the game at 105 with 7:00 to play in regulation. Dragic then added a pair of free throws to give Miami its first lead since 2-0. Kelly Olynyk, who had 14 points off the bench, hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put the Heat ahead 113-107 with 4:52 to play. With Miami up 121-119 with 3 seconds to go in regulation, Khris Middleton shot an air ball and Antetokounmpo tipped it in at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. Adebayo sank four free throws in the extra period and Dragic scored six points in overtime to lift Miami to its second win. ""We were down and we never quit,"" Dragic said. ""We fought back. We could make our job a little bit easier if we hit all those free throws. But in the end, a great comeback. When Giannis hit that layup (at the horn), a lot of teams in this league would just quit and we didn't. I'm proud of the guys."" Kendrick Nun scored 18 points before fouling out for the Heat, who had seven players score in double figures. Justise Winslow had 10 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, and Miami rookie Tyler Herro, a Milwaukee native, finished with 14. ""I didn't really know what to expect, but I was happy to hear the crowd cheer for me,"" Herro said. Middleton added 25 points for the Bucks. Heat guard Jimmy Butler missed his second straight game after he and his girlfriend welcomed a baby on Wednesday. The Bucks hit 14 3-pointers in the first half -- the most the Heat have ever allowed in a first half -- en route to building a 70-53 lead at halftime. Milwaukee finished 17-for-54 from beyond the arc. ""Sometimes you're going to go 2-for-24 but if you don't allow 39 points in the fourth quarter, you probably have a decent chance to be on the other side of the score,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""The offense definitely needs to be better, but 39 is the number that stands out to me. TIP-INS Heat: Derrick Jones left the game with a left groin strain. Bucks: Antetokounmpo came one assist shy of becoming the fourth player in NBA history to record a triple-double in consecutive games to start a season (Magic Johnson in 1981 and '82, Jerry Lucas in '72 and Oscar Robertson in '61).","401160668"
"DETROIT --  The Philadelphia 76ers are expected to be one of the NBA's top teams this season. Saturday night, they lived up to those expectations with their best player was in street clothes. With Joel Embiid sidelined with an ankle injury, the 76ers still had too much height and speed for the Detroit Pistons, beating them 117-111. Tobias Harris scored 29 points against his former team, Al Horford added 23 and Mike Scott had 17 as a reserve. Of their 69 points, 33 came on 11-of-19 3-point shooting. ""They are really tough to guard because they've got so many big guys who can pop out and knock down a 3-pointer,"" Pistons center Christian Wood said. Harris said the Sixers won by sticking to their game plan despite Embiid's absence. ""We were playing defense, moving the call and creating shots,"" he said. ""I had a lot of great looks because we would get a stop at one end and we would get down the floor and create something off the run."" Philadelphia had 30 assists to Detroit's 20 and held one of the league's best offensive-rebounding teams to five in 37 attempts. ""We've got a lot of new parts and we're still learning each other, but we kept battling tonight,"" said Ben Simmons, who had 13 points and 10 assists. ""That was huge."" The Pistons also weren't at full strength, either. Blake Griffin's season won't start for Detroit until November because of knee and hamstring soreness and Reggie Jackson missed the game with a back injury. Detroit led by 13 points in the third quarter, but Drummond came out of the game with his fourth foul, leaving Dwane Casey to improvise a lineup that also couldn't include leading scorer Derrick Rose. Philadelphia cut the lead to one in less than four minutes. ""A stretch without Blake, Reggie, Andre and Derrick is going to be tough,"" he said. ""We're asking guys to play together who have never been on the floor as a group with the game on the line."" Rose led Detroit with 31 points in 27 minutes, but his history of injuries doesn't allow Casey to use him as much as he'd like. ""Believe me, I would love to have him out there for 40 minutes a night, but he just can't do it,"" Casey said. The Pistons turned the ball over 23 times, leading to 31 Philadelphia points, and missed 15 free throws in a game that was close until the closing moments. Drummond had 13 points and 12 rebounds, but only three came on the offensive end, and he was 3-of-10 from the line. ""You can't make 21 free throws out of 36 and turn the ball over 23 times against a great team,"" Casey said. Drummond had a chance to tie it in the final five minutes, but Kyle O'Quinn blocked his layup and Simmons scored at the other end before Drummond got off the floor. That gave the 76ers a 101-97 lead with 4:37 to play and forced coach Dwane Casey into a timeout. After a Pistons miss, Horford hit a 3-pointer, then made it 107-97 with a three-point play after a Detroit turnover. Horford added two more baskets as the Sixers closed out the game. TIP INS 76ers: Horford scored 15 points in the first 10 minutes of the third quarter. ... Harris, a fan favorite during his time in Detroit, playfully waved to the crowd after one of his 3-pointers. Pistons: Casey challenged a second-quarter foul on Drummond. The call was upheld, costing Detroit a timeout. ... Markieff Morris had 14 points and Luke Kennard combined for 26 points in the first half, but only seven in the second half. WOOD LOOKING FOR PLAYING TIME Pistons center Christian Wood played four minutes in the season opener and didn't get on the floor Thursday against Atlanta, so he wanted to make the most of his 19 minutes on Saturday. With Griffin out and Drummond in foul trouble, Wood had 11 points and five rebounds. ""I'm trying to show that I deserve to be in the rotation,"" he said. ""I want the coaches to know I can guard someone like Ben Simmons or Mike Scott in a key situation.""","401160669"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young wants the ball when the game is on the line. He knows he's expected to be Atlanta's big-time player. Young scored 39 points, including Atlanta's last eight, to continue his hot start and the Hawks beat the Orlando Magic 103-99 on Saturday night. When asked how he flourished in the final minutes, Young said: ""That's what makes big-time players what they are. They step up in big moments."" Young, who had 38 points in Atlanta's season-opening win at Detroit, again carried the scoring burden for the Hawks. Atlanta had no other player with more than 10 points. The second-year point guard added nine assists and seven rebounds. Young took over the game after Orlando led 96-95. His baseline reverse layup gave the Hawk the lead. Following a tying free throw by Aaron Gordon, Young's layup again gave the lead back to the Hawks. Young added a long, fallaway 3-pointer, stretching the advantage to 102-97 with 25 seconds remaining. He celebrated with a shimmy strut toward the other end of the court. ""He's clutch, man,"" Hawks forward John Collins said. ""He just has that clutch gene. Guys like him take the shots down the stretch and just expect them to go in."" The Magic couldn't find a way to stop Young. ""I tried to stay in front and make him shoot over top of me,"" said Markelle Fultz. ""He shot it. Just got to slap him on the butt and say, `Good shot."" Young's 38 points against Detroit were the most in a season opener since Dominique Wilkins' 39 against the Nets in 1986. Young led NBA rookies with nine 30-point games last season, and now he already has two. ""Whatever it takes,"" Young said. ""I'm just glad we're winning."" In a matchup of 21-year-old point guards, Young had 17 first-half points. Fultz finished with 12 points. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 23 points. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 10 rebounds. D.J. Augustin had 14. While Young sank 5 of 10 3-pointers, Orlando made only 5 of 31. ""You can't win an NBA game shooting 17% from the 3,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. The actual figure was 16.1%. ""We're all pros,"" Gordon said. ""We got to make those shots."" The Hawks' 9-2 run to open the second half included Young's back-to-back trademark one-handed floaters. He added a steal of Gordon's pass and a 3-pointer for a 61-52 lead -- Atlanta's biggest of the game. Atlanta led 85-84 before Augustin's four free throws and Michael Carter-Williams' powerful jam gave Orlando a 90-85 advantage. Atlanta twice pulled even on shots by Young. His long 3-pointer tied the game at 90, and his jumper knotted the score at 94-all. Jabari Parker and Kevin Huerter each had 10 points for Atlanta. YOUTH IS SERVED The Hawks' youth doesn't end with Young. Atlanta's other starters were 20-year-old Cam Reddish, 21-year-old De'Andre Hunter, 22-year-old Collins and 26-year-old Alex Len. Reddish and Hunter, the team's first-round draft picks, each had six points. Collins had nine points and a game-high 12 rebounds. FREE FOR ALL The Hawks overcame a lopsided disadvantage at the free-throw line. The Magic made 24 of 26 free throws. The Hawks were only 8 of 15 from the line. TIP-INS Magic:  Orlando opened a string of five games in eight days. The stretch ends with home games against the Knicks, Milwaukee and Denver next week. Hawks: Rookie F Bruno Fernando left the game in the third period with a right ankle sprain. He was helped off the court. ... Huerter, who missed all five preseason games with right knee soreness, saw his playing time expand. He was limited to 15 minutes in the opener at Detroit and had 10 points and four assists in 20 minutes.","401160670"
"NEW YORK --  With so much new for Kemba Walker this season, it sure helped to have some familiar feelings. Once he finished with another big night at Madison Square Garden, it was Tacko time. Walker scored a season-high 32 points, snapping out of an early season shooting slump with seven 3-pointers, and the Boston Celtics beat the winless New York Knicks 118-95 on Saturday night. Walker began his Celtics career by going 4 for 18 in an opening loss to Philadelphia, and even with a strong finish against the Raptors was only 8 for 22. But the New York native and former UConn star thrived again at Madison Square Garden, going 11 for 17 overall and 7 for 12 behind the arc. ""It's great energy in here,"" Walker said. ""I'm from here, I've been playing here since I was in high school, so it's just always good to come back."" Jaylen Brown added 19 points for the Celtics, who won their second straight after beating NBA champion Toronto on Friday. Jayson Tatum had 15 points and nine rebounds, and Boston broke open a close game so thoroughly in the fourth quarter that 7-foot-5 rookie Tacko Fall was able to make his NBA debut, scoring four points on a pair of loudly cheered dunks that required barely any jumping. ""It was unbelievable,"" Fall said. ""All throughout the game I didn't know it was going to happen. Once the score kept going up, I was thinking in my mind this might be go time."" Rookie RJ Barrett scored 26 points for the Knicks, who were outscored 72-44 after halftime in their home opener and fell to 0-3. Mitchell Robinson added 17. ""That was an embarrassing second half,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. New York raced to an early lead and trailed only by six after three, but the Celtics scored the first eight points of the final period to make it 90-76. The Celtics then put it away with a 19-4 surge, featuring three straight baskets by Walker, to expand it to 109-85. ""It's a new team, new situation for me,"" said Walker, who had played his entire career in Charlotte. ""But tonight in the second half, yeah, I felt great."" The Celtics had a six-point lead with 5 minutes remaining in the half, but the Knicks outscored them 16-5 the rest of the way to bring a 51-46 advantage with them into the locker room. TIP-INS Celtics: The Celtics were short-handed at center, where Daniel Theis didn't travel because of a sprained left ankle, joining Enes Kanter (bruised left knee) on the inactive list. ""So we're slowly working our way towards 5-less, but we've got a few more left,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Boston did have Fall active for the first time after missing the first two games while in concussion protocol. Knicks: The Knicks have lost four straight at home to the Celtics. ... Julius Randle had 10 points and 10 rebounds but struggled again with his shot, going 4 for 11. NO HOMECOMING Walker moved quickly to join the Celtics in free agency even though the Knicks had a need at point guard and the money to pay him. He understands why some players wouldn't want to play at home, but that wasn't why he made his choice. ""I think it can be a distraction just because you obviously grew up there and you know so many people, but that wasn't the case for me,"" Walker said. ""It wasn't even about that. It was more about the fit, style of play, things of that nature. Like I said, I just thought that Boston was the best fit and opportunity for me."" STRUGGLING SMITH Dennis Smith Jr. continues to struggle after being sidelined with a back injury during preseason. A night after going 0 for 4 in 4  1/2 minutes in Brooklyn, the point guard was 0 for 3. Fans booed during his last stint and then began a chant of ""We want Frank! We want Frank!"" But fellow point guard Frank Ntilikina didn't come back in, playing only 1 minute. ""All we got is us in this locker room,"" Smith said. ""That's what we got to focus on.""","401160671"
"CLEVELAND --  John Beilein was soaked from his shirt to his socks after an unexpected shower. Cleveland's rookie coach had his pro basketball baptism. Beilein picked up his first NBA win and got doused with water in the locker room by Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and the rest of the Cavaliers, who played the kind of ball their rookie coach has been preaching for weeks in a 110-99 win over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. Thompson scored 25 points and made his first career 3-pointer and Love scored 21 and just missed a triple-double as the Cavs opened their 50th season at home with a solid win over a playoff team from last year. Following the game, Beilein presented with the game ball by general manager Koby Altman before he was ambushed by the Cavs, who jumped from their seats and dumped water bottles over his head. ""Excuse my appearance,"" the former Michigan coach said as he sat down for his news conference. ""I just took a little bath."" Beilein, who won at every level in college, said he'll savor the memento from his first pro victory. ""I'm very fortunate to have a lot of game balls, but this one is going to be pretty special,"" the 66-year-old said. ""It's an NBA ball No. 1, but anytime you change jobs like this it's a very difficult time on your family, on you and everyone -- it's such a transition. It will be special."" Cavs forward Larry Nance was thrilled for Beilein. ""It was awesome just to see him breathe a nice sigh of relief,"" he said. ""There was a lot of pressure on us, especially the home opener so for him to get this win. First win for a lot of the guys -- all the rookies. The Cavs began their golden anniversary by honoring the club's past. They brought back some of their legendary players and wore uniforms from the 1990s while taking a look back their history. The present looked more promising. Love was much more involved than during an opening-night loss at Orlando on Wednesday, adding 13 rebounds and nine assists. Thompson also had 13 rebounds, Collin Sexton scored 18 and rookie Darius Garland 12, making a key, step-back 3-pointer down the stretch to slow Indiana's comeback. Malcolm Brogdon scored 30 and had 10 assists to lead the Pacers. The Cavs blitzed the Pacers to open second quarter, going on a 26-4 run. They made seven 3-pointers and outscored Indiana 39-20 in the period to open a 65-48 halftime lead. ""They pretty much did whatever they wanted,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Giving up 39 points, you just can't have quarters like that. They were the more aggressive team, the scrappier team."" It was Thompson's stunning 3-pointer in the first quarter that got the Cavs going. Thompson, who has been working on his range in practice, hadn't attempted a 3 since the 2016-17 season, when he pulled up and dropped a 27-footer -- his first make from beyond the arc in 642 games. ""No way,"" Beilein said with a smile when asked if Thompson will have the green light going forward.

He's been scrimmaging, but hasn't been cleared to play in full-court workouts. ... G Jeremy Lamb sat out with a bruised right hip sustained in the season-opening loss to Detroit on Wednesday.

McLEOD HONORED Love wore a neck tie while warming up before the game to pay tribute to Fred McLeod, the club's popular broadcaster who died unexpectedly in September. McLeod's widow, Beth, sent ties from her husband's collection to select players, coaches and media members to wear for the opener. The Cavs showed a moving video during the first quarter with highlights from McLeod, who handled play-by-play duties for the Detroit Pistons before coming to the Cavs in 2006.

"CHICAGO --  Pascal Siakam is trying to adjust to the attention opponents are giving him now that Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green are no longer around in Toronto. The fourth-year power forward is certainly providing offense. He just needs to cut back on the turnovers. Siakam scored 19 points, OG Anunoby added 17 and the Raptors spoiled Chicago's home opener by beating the Bulls 108-84 on Saturday night. The defending NBA champions went on a run in the second quarter to take a 48-40 halftime lead and pulled away for their 10th straight win over the cold-shooting Bulls. Siakam is giving the Raptors the scoring they need, averaging 28.7 points through three games. But he got called for five fouls and committed four turnovers against Chicago, bringing his team-leading total to 13. ""I can always argue if it was a foul, wasn't a foul. But as a leader, I have to be able to not be in those situations -- and be in the game,"" said Siakam, the NBA's Most Improved Player last season. ""I've got to figure that out. Turnovers, obviously, it's something new for me seeing double teams. I've got to find a way to not turn the ball over."" Anunoby hit three 3-pointers, and Serge Ibaka added 18 points and seven rebounds. Fred VanVleet scored 16 as the Raptors shook off a loss Friday in Boston. The Bulls see themselves as playoff contenders coming off a 22-60 season that ranked among the worst in franchise history. But they hardly looked the part, shooting just 30.2% overall and 9 of 35 on 3s. ""They brought the physicality to us and they threw the first punch,"" Otto Porter Jr. said. ""We didn't really respond well."" Wendell Carter Jr. led Chicago with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Zach LaVine scored 11 after averaging 26.5 over the first two games. Lauri Markkanen struggled again, finishing with nine points for the second straight night. The 7-footer from Finland shot 3 of 10 after going 4 for 15 in a loss at Memphis. PORTER HURT It didn't help Chicago that Porter missed most of the second quarter after taking what appeared to be an inadvertent elbow to the face while drawing a charge against Stanley Johnson. Porter spent several minutes lying face down as blood poured out, leaving a puddle on the court. He went straight to the locker room with the team's medical staff to get six stitches in the left corner of his mouth and returned to start the second half. By then, the Raptors led by eight after outscoring Chicago 17-4 over the final 6 1/2 minutes of the second quarter. PULLING AWAY Marc Gasol and Kyle Lowry hit consecutive 3s in the third. Anunoby added another from beyond the arc to bump it to 62-46 with 7:47 left in the quarter, and the Raptors remained in control the rest of the way. ""That's what we need (Anunoby) to do,"" VanVleet said. ""The way he played tonight, if he plays like that we'll be a tough team to deal with."" QUOTABLE ""Most likely, yeah."" -- Porter, when asked after the game if he was sore. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto outrebounded Chicago 59-45. ... Raptors coach Nick Nurse might have to pay more attention to the Angels now that Joe Maddon is managing Los Angeles and not his beloved Cubs. ""It's a tough one for me,"" said Nurse, a big Cubs fan growing up in Iowa. ""Always loved the Cubs. Joe and I have become friends the last couple years. I certainly will become a much bigger Angels fan than I ever have been in my life now."" Nurse brought the Larry O'Brien Trophy to Wrigley Field last season and sang ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" while wearing Harry Caray-style glasses. Maddon and the Cubs parted after the season, ending a five-year run that produced a drought-busting championship in 2016. David Ross, a member of the title team, is the new manager. ... F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (sore left groin) played four minutes in his season debut after Nurse said he and F Patrick McCaw (sore left knee) would not be available. McCaw has missed all three games. Bulls: Coach Jim Boylen said F Chandler Hutchison (hamstring) is ""closer than ever"" to making his season debut. ... The Bulls are obviously looking to play better at the United Center after tying New York for the league's worst home record at 9-32 last season. ""It's a huge point of emphasis,"" Boylen said. ""But those are just words. You've got to go do it.""","401160673"
"HOUSTON --  Russell Westbrook said he'll take some time to reflect on the significance of his latest performance. After posting his second straight triple-double since joining the Houston Rockets and the 139th of his career, Westbrook passed Magic Johnson for second on the all-time list, behind only Oscar Robertson's 181. Westbrook had 28 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds and James Harden had 29 points to lead the Rockets to a 126-123 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. ""I know nowadays getting a triple-double seems normal, but I take a lot of pride and a lot of energy and sacrifice and a lot of things I do off the floor to get ready to compete and play at a high level,"" Westbrook said. ""For me, that's a great accomplishment, especially growing up and never thinking I would be able to play in the NBA. Now, I'm able to be in the history books. It's a blessing, and I don't take it for granted."" Westbrook hit two clutch free throws to give Houston the three-point lead with 6.1 seconds remaining. Josh Hart missed a 3 at the buzzer and Houston held on. Houston worked through occasional chemistry issues, frequently turning the ball over on errant passes. Westbrook and Harden combined for 12 turnovers, with Harden leading the game with eight. Harden was 2 of 18 from the 3-point line after going 1 for 8 in the season opener. He was 8-for-29 from the field, but was 11 of 12 from the free throw line. Harden shrugged off the shooting woes. ""I'm going to take as many shots as they give me,"" Harden said. ""Tonight, they didn't fall. But the most important thing is, we've got to win. I think we locked in defensively when we needed to get stops. It's slowly coming together."" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni also said he wasn't alarmed by Harden's rough shooting start to the season. ""I don't care who he's playing against, what kind of scheme -- either he gets 50 or he doesn't, and that's depending on him,"" D'Antoni said. ""I'm expecting next game he'll do it, and if not, the game after."" On Westbrook, D'Antoni complimented his poise and how nothing fazes him, calling the guard ""relentless."" Similarly, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry called Westbrook the Energizer Bunny for his unwavering energy. ""The people that say, `How are they going to fit or how are they going to do?' When you're great players, you find a way to make it work, and they're great players,"" Gentry said. The Rockets bounced back after a 117-111 season-opening loss to Milwaukee on Thursday night. Brandon Ingram gave Houston's defense fits, scoring 35 points while adding a game-high 15 rebounds. Lonzo Ball had 18 points on 4 of 9 shooting from 3. New Orleans is off to its first 0-3 start since the 2016-2017 season. ""We're a work in progress,"" Gentry said. ""I loved the effort that we played with and thought we did a really good job. We put ourselves in a position to win against a really good team."" The Pelicans were without point guard Jrue Holiday, who is day-to-day with a left knee sprain. Hart started in Holiday's place, scoring 23 points in 34 minutes. The Pelicans are already without top draft pick Zion Williamson, who is expected to miss the first six to eight weeks of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee. For the last play of the third quarter, Westbrook found Austin Rivers for a corner 3 to cut New Orleans' lead to 100-97 entering the fourth quarter. The Rockets opened up the final quarter on an 8-0 run, capped off by a thunderous two-handed dunk by Westbrook in transition to put Houston up 105-100. The Rockets led 29-24 at the end of the first quarter, but the Pelicans had a better second quarter and entered halftime tied at 61. In the final play of the first half, Harden was unable to cleanly get a 3 off at the buzzer in a heavily defended shot attempt. After the horn sounded, Harden slammed the ball off the court in frustration, only for it to come back hit him in the mouth. ""It got my beard so it just protected me,"" Harden said with a laugh. TIP-INS Pelicans: Hart received a technical foul shortly after hitting a 3-pointer midway through the third quarter, possibly for taunting but it was unclear. ... Jahlil Okafor fouled out of the game early in the fourth quarter after playing less than 12 minutes in the game. Rockets: All Houston starters scored in double-figures, and Eric Gordon added 13 points off the bench. ... Houston went 13 of 45 from 3 (28.9%). NBA/CHINA RELATIONSHIP There was a pre-game demonstration outside of the main entrance of the Toyota Center by several dozen people holding signs and wearing shirts in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Houston general manager Daryl Morey angered China with a since-deleted tweet in support of the protesters earlier this month. Several protesters attended Thursday night's season opener, but fewer were seen in attendance on Saturday night. ASTROS SCORE UPDATES Some of the loudest cheers from the relatively lightly attended Toyota Center crowd came when the Rockets posted score updates and video highlights on the videoboard from the Houston Astros' World Series Game 4, happening simultaneously in Washington. The Rockets PA announcer even accidentally called JJ Redick ""Josh Reddick"" on one 3-pointer to the crowd before correcting himself. Reddick is an Astros outfielder.","401160674"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs admitted it was tough trading Davis Bertans to Washington, and the subsequent circumstances surrounding his departure only made matters worse. The Spurs certainly had some seller's remorse after Bertans' play Saturday night, but San Antonio was happy to prevail over the Wizards. DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points, including the game-winning basket in heavy traffic in the final seconds, and San Antonio beat Washington 124-122. Bertans, traded from San Antonio to Washington in the offseason, made all five of his 3-point attempts and scored 23 points against his former team. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was grateful Bertans didn't take the Wizards' final shot. ""I almost jumped out on the court,"" Popovich said. ""He had a great game. He was wonderful. He's a super human being, a heck of a player. I'm actually happy for him. He was great. He was great."" Bertans was traded to clear cap space for Marcus Morris, who agreed to a two-year deal with San Antonio only to back out of the agreement and instead sign a one-year contract with New York. Having already dealt Bertans, the Spurs opted to sign Trey Lyles. ""It was emotional a little bit,"" Bertans said of his return. ""I spent a lot of time here. As I see it, even though I got traded, there's nothing but love for the Spurs and that's mutual."" That love was evident in Popovich's playful banter with Bertans on the court following the game and former Spurs general manager R.C. Buford's long embrace with Bertans in the Wizards locker room. Bertans got to see the Spurs grind out a victory as an opponent for the first time in his four-year career. San Antonio recorded its 20th straight home victory over Washington with some late heroics. Using a screen by LaMarcus Aldridge near midcourt, DeRozan drove to the basket and spun in a layup between Rui Hachiumra and Thomas Bryant, putting the Spurs up with 5.5 second remaining. ""I tell him all the time, I need you to take over at all times, not just when we really, really need it,"" San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray said. ""But he did his thing tonight. None of us were shocked or surprised. That's DeMar for you."" Bradley Beal attempted to force overtime with a driving layup, but Derrick White blocked his shot and grabbed the ball as the buzzer sounded. ""Bottom line is, he didn't get the call,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said, ""but that's basketball. You move on to the next game. We keep playing like this, we're going to get the respect."" Aldridge led the Spurs with 27 points. Murray had 10 points, 10 rebounds and four assists and Bryn Forbes added 16 points. Beal had 25 points and Hachimura added 16 points for the Wizards. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington's last victory in San Antonio was Dec. 11, 1999, when Mitch Richmond scored 31 points to beat Tim Duncan, who is now a Spurs assistant coach. ... The Spurs played a tribute video for Bertans prior to player introductions. Bertans averaged 6.2 points in 220 games over three seasons with San Antonio. ... Isaiah Thomas played in his first game since April 7, when he had 10 points and three assists in 24 minutes at Portland. Thomas was healthy, but did not appear in any postseason games for Denver last season. Thomas had 16 points and five assists against the Spurs. Spurs: Aldridge was 2 for 3 on 3-pointers, making multiple 3s in a game for the first time since Dec. 23, 2017. Aldridge has made 124 3-pointers in his 14-year career. ... Bryn Forbes played in his 200th career game, joining Avery Johnson, Bruce Bowen, Mark Olberding, Fabricio Oberto, Jaren Jackson and Gary Neal as the only undrafted players to reach that milestone with the Spurs. ... Lonnie Walker IV drew loud cheers as he made his season debut two minutes into the fourth quarter. Walker made his first attempt, a right-handed runner in the lane, for his only points in five minutes. ... The Spurs had just nine turnovers after committing 21 in their season opener. WATCHING THE CLOCK The Spurs are limiting Murray's minutes as he returns from surgery to repair his right ACL, which forced him to miss last season. Murray played 23 minutes against the Wizards after playing 24 minutes in the Spurs' season opener against the Knicks on Wednesday. The 6-foot-5 guard has looked good in both games, but neither he nor the Spurs are ready to do away with his minutes restriction. ""No, no, no, no, no, I trust them,"" Murray said when asked if he would request more time. ""They've been doing this a long time. So, I trust them and they know what they're doing.""","401160675"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Bojan Bogdanovic wasn't about to let a sore ankle keep him from making his presence felt on offense Bogdanovic hit five 3-pointers and scored 26 points, powering the Utah Jazz to a 113-81 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night. He shot 10 of 18 (.556) from the field overall while playing just 24 minutes after sitting out a game with a sprained left ankle. Bogdanovic was a game-time decision before making his second start. ""It's awesome to see him so happy and just be back,"" guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""He creates. He does a lot of things off the ball. He gets into the paint. It draws a lot of attention and makes it easier for us."" Mitchell added 15 points, while Mike Conley chipped in 12 points and eight assists. Georges Niang added 12 points off the bench. Utah shot 48.6% from 3-point range after shooting just 28.6% from long distance over the team's first two games. ""We all live long enough to have good days and bad days,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""The way that our team responded from (the loss to the Lakers) to me is the significant thing."" Dwayne Dedmon scored 11 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 10 for the Kings, who failed to overcome 37% shooting from the field. The teams combined for 39 turnovers. Sacramento coach Luke Walton pulled all of his starters at once with 8:39 remaining in the third quarter after the Kings fell behind by 32 points. Only Dwayne Dedmon returned in the fourth quarter. ""There really wasn't much to be discussed,"" forward Harrison Barnes said. ""We weren't getting it done with the energy and effort starting off the game in that third quarter, so he made the decision to pull us."" Once Bojan Bogdanovic hit the court, he wasted no time torching Sacramento's defense. He scored three straight baskets to ignite a 16-2 run in the first quarter. Then Bogdanovic punctuated the run with his first 3-point basket, giving the Jazz an 18-8 lead. ""He might need to take a couple of more games off if he's gonna come back like that every time,"" Conley said. ""He's a big piece and when he's hot, he's hot. We kept finding him. Guys were being unselfish and finding the hot hand."" Sacramento cut the deficit to five points on four occasions during the quarter -- the final time on Nemanja Bjelica's layup that made it 28-23. The Jazz offense smothered the Kings after that and steadily pulled away. Jeff Green hit back-to-back 3-pointers to extend Utah's lead to 46-33 early in the second quarter and the Jazz maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way. The Jazz used a 19-2 run, spanning the second and third quarters, to take a 75-43 lead. Bojan Bogdanovic, Mitchell, and Conley all hit 3-pointers to fuel the run, which prompted Walton to sub out his entire starting lineup. ""That's not who we are,"" Walton said. ""That was, honestly, an embarrassing performance we gave out there, coaches included."" ROAD WOES Sacramento has dropped its first two road games by an average margin of 30.5 points. During their 0-3 start, the Kings have allowed each opponent to shoot over 50% from the field. Sacramento, on the other hand, shot under 40% in two of the three contests. Transition baskets, normally a strength for the Kings a season ago, have tapered off. Sacramento has totaled 19 fast-break points in three games. ""Three games, we're barely getting over 100 points,"" Barnes said. ""The fast-break points are obviously low. Our turnovers, you know, aren't allowing us to get out and run."" HOT SHOTS The Jazz tied a franchise record with 13 made 3-pointers in the first half. Bogdanovic accounted for four of those outside baskets. Utah finished the game with 18 3-pointers, after combining for 14 baskets from the perimeter over its first two games against Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Lakers. ""It was much needed,"" Conley said. ""Our defense has really carried over the last few games. Tonight, our offense picked up on that end too."" TIP INS Kings: De'Aaron Fox finished with five assists in 20 minutes. . Bogdanovic's turnaround bank shot with 5.5 seconds left in the second quarter was waved off at halftime after being ruled a shot-clock violation. ... Sacramento forced 21 turnovers.

"PHOENIX --  It had been a downright depressing 24-hour stretch for the Phoenix Suns, who found out their starting center was suspended for 25 games and then immediately lost to the Denver Nuggets by one point in overtime. The next night, with every reason to pout, the Suns didn't do it. Instead, they came out and beat one of the NBA's preseason championship favorites. Devin Booker scored 30 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 20 and the Suns beat the Los Angeles Clippers 130-122 on Saturday for their first win in the series in more than three years. ""It feels amazing,"" Oubre said. ""Everybody chipped in. We fought through adversity once again, we're finding who we are and we're continuing to grow. That's the most beautiful thing about it."" Phoenix (2-1) snapped a 12-game losing streak to the Clippers and won for the first time since losing starting center Deandre Ayton to a 25-game suspension after he tested positive for a diuretic. The Suns had a 15-point lead midway through the fourth quarter before Los Angeles' Lou Williams made things interesting with back-to-back 3-pointers. The Clippers pulled within six on Kawhi Leonard's 3-pointer with less than two minutes left, but the Suns' Tyler Johnson responded with his own 3-pointer to stop the rally. The teams were tied at 55 at halftime and the Suns pushed to a 91-85 lead after three quarters largely thanks to the unlikely duo of Frank Kaminsky III and Jevon Carter, who combined for 17 points during the rally. ""When you have losses like (Denver) on the first night on a back-to-back you're just antsy to play because you have that bad taste in your mouth and it's fresh,"" Kaminsky said. ""That showed tonight. We came out with a lot of energy, physicality and set the tone on defense."" Carter started in the absence of Ricky Rubio, who missed the game because of a knee injury suffered on Friday against Denver. The second-year pro finished with eight points and six assists in 33 minutes. Kaminsky had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. The Suns have won two of the season's first three games for the first time since 2015. ""The fight was really evident tonight,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""Holding that team to 22 points in the first quarter, we got off to a great start. Then after that, they were the Clippers, but we were pretty good."" Los Angeles (2-1) was led by Montrezl Harrell's 28 points. Leonard added 27 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists. The Clippers fought foul trouble for much of the second half, but coach Doc Rivers said his team didn't have anyone to blame but itself after a poor defensive showing. ""You have a couple of these games where you're just late on everything,"" Rivers said. ""I thought we were late on everything. On the offensive end, we had no pace. We deserved to lose."" THE TALKING GAME Booker had an efficient night, shooting 10 of 20 from the field and 3 of 6 from 3-point range. He was also locked in when it came to conversation, going back-and-forth with Clippers guard Patrick Beverley with buckets and barbs. Oubre said Booker's performance was fun to watch. ""It's Devin Booker, man,"" Oubre said. ""I've seen it before. I'll see it again."" TIP-INS Clippers: The Clippers got 66 points from the bench, including Harrell's 28 and Williams' 23.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Finally, Thunder fans have something to cheer about. Dennis Schroder scored 22 points to help Oklahoma City rout the Golden State Warriors 120-92 on Sunday for their first victory of the season. It was a long-awaited ray of hope for fans who have been looking for something to cling to after the Thunder traded away longtime star Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul in the offseason. The blowout matched Oklahoma City's largest margin of victory over the Warriors since the franchise moved from Seattle before the 2008-09 season. The fact that the breakthrough came against the Warriors didn't mean much to Paul. ""I think it was more about us, not about them,"" he said. ""We've got to have an identity. How we are going to play defensively and offensively? Pushing the pace, moving the ball and playing with the right spirit."" Now, Paul and Westbrook will face off Monday night in Houston. Paul said it might be a bit awkward, but he won't make a big deal about it. ""It'll be my first time back there since I got traded so you know, it's another game,"" he said. ""Move on. See a couple familiar faces say what up to my man the equipment manager. Keep it pushing."" The Warriors still have a lot to figure out. Stephen Curry scored 23 points on Sunday, making 7 of 18 shots while his teammates made just 23 of 74. Golden State was coming off a season-opening home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Kevin Durant left the Warriors for Brooklyn in the offseason and Klay Thompson is likely out for the season with a torn left ACL. Still, Golden State expected to be more competitive early in the season. ""It sucks,"" Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ""But I guess just about everybody except Tim Duncan has been through it. But it sucks pretty bad."" Oklahoma City roared out to a 70-37 halftime lead. The Thunder shot 56.5% before the break while holding the Warriors to 27.5%. Schroder had 16 points and six rebounds in the first half.

Oklahoma City led 105-68 heading into the final period. Gallinari scored 21 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 19 points and nine rebounds for the Thunder. The Warriors allowed the Thunder to shoot 56% from the field after allowing the Clippers to shoot 63%. ""Everybody loved our offense, but it wasn't our offense that was making us great,"" Green said.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Rookie Ja Morant had the best game of his young career and veteran Jae Crowder hit a game-winner to make the Memphis Grizzlies' first victory of the season memorable. Crowder's 3-pointer from the top of the key as time expired in overtime lifted the Grizzlies to a 134-133 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night. ""We've been playing well these first two games,"" Crowder said of losses to Miami and Chicago. ""We put five quarters together and came out with a win."" The winning shot was possible after Spencer Dinwiddie split a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds left, Grizzlies reserve Solomon Hill grabbing the rebound when the second shot was missed. After a Nets foul in the backcourt, Memphis inbounded the ball with 3.7 seconds left. Morant, who led the Grizzlies with 30 points, dribbled behind his back as he crossed half court, then handed out his ninth assist, shuffling a pass to the trailing Crowder for the 28-foot game-winner. ""I believe in Jae the whole way, and he delivered for us,"" Morant, the second pick in last summer's NBA Draft, said of the winning basket. ""Anytime you lose at the buzzer, it's always a tough loss,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Dillon Brooks scored 21 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies. Morant also blocked Kyrie Irving's 17-footer at the end of regulation to keep the score tied at 120-all. Crowder's winning 3-pointer was his second basket of the game, as he finished with six points. His previous 3-pointer came with 1:09 left as Memphis took its first lead of overtime at 131-128. Irving finished with 37 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Nets. Caris LeVert added 27 points, Dinwiddie had 16 points on 3-for-13 shooting from the field. ""What a game, huh?"" Grizzlies first-year coach Taylor Jenkins said. "". Obviously, to get our first win of the season it took a complete team effort."" Morant led that ""team effort,"" helping Memphis reach overtime by scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter. Morant's layup -- his final points of the period -- tied the score at 120 with 7 seconds left. He blocked Irving on the ensuing possession as time ran out in regulation. ""I head-faked,"" Irving said. ""I tried to shoot a fade. He's got long arms. He got a good contest on it and blocked the shot.""

"DALLAS --  Damian Lillard helped the Portland Trail Blazers a few ways on Sunday night. He scored the eventual winning basket and talked his coach into making a replay challenge, all in the closing seconds. Lillard's twisting layup with 26 seconds remaining proved to be the winner as the Trail Blazers beat the Dallas Mavericks 121-119. Lillard scored 26 of his 28 points in the second half, including a basket that gave the Blazers a 120-119 lead. The Blazers' CJ McCollum had a game-high 35 points. Kristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 32 points. After Lillard's score, the Mavericks' Luka Doncic missed a 3-point attempt and Portland won a challenge of a call that would have sent the Mavericks' Dorian Finney-Smith to the foul line after he'd grabbed a rebound and attempted a shot with eight seconds left. The foul was called on Lillard. Instead, there was a jump ball. Crew chief Courtney Kirkland explained how a one-year experimental rule applied to this review. ""Once Portland challenged the play and we were able to go and look at replay, we were able to have clear, conclusive evidence that Damian Lillard legally deflected the ball from Dorian Finney-Smith. The ball was loose when the whistle blew, which led to an inadvertent whistle. Therefore, we ended up having a jump ball."" Lillard had insisted to coach Terry Stotts that he should challenge the call, even though losing it would have cost the Blazers' last timeout. ""If we lose the challenge, they are on the (foul) line and we are down one (point), but (Lillard) was pretty adamant, so I trusted him,"" Stotts said. Dallas still seemed likely to win the jump with 7-foot-3 center Kristaps Porzingis. Portland center Hassan Whiteside had fouled out and 7-footer Zach Collins left the game with an injury. ""I was thinking we don't even have a five man in the game, so how are we going to win a jump ball?"" McCollum said. ""Then Porzingis tipped it to us, so it worked out."" The Blazers' Kent Bazemore got the ball and was fouled. He made the first of two free throws. Doncic rebounded and passed to Tim Hardaway, whose shot from about midcourt rattled off the front of the rim as time expired. Lillard, who scored 67 points in Portland's first two games, had only two points in the first half on 1-for-7 shooting. ""I didn't feel bad,"" he said. ""I didn't feel like I was just missing terrible shots."" Porzingis said the Mavericks discussed at halftime trying to keep Lillard in check. ""We knew we couldn't let him get going. Then in the second half, Damian really got going."" For Portland, Rodney Hood had 20 points, Bazemore 11 and Zach Collins 10. Doncic finished with 29 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. Teammate Maxi Kleber had 14 points, Seth Curry 12 and Hardaway 11. Portland never held the lead through the first three periods but rallied to tie the game at 95 on one of two free throws by Lillard eight seconds before the end of the third quarter. Dallas struggled through a 2-for-19 shooting spell and fell behind by as many as six points before Curry hit a 3-pointer that tied the game at 107. Kleber, who had totaled only eight points in the Mavericks' first two games, scored eight in the first 2:49 with two 3-pointers and a dunk. Dallas led at halftime 71-59. OWNER'S TWEET-MENT Mark Cuban tweeted about Portland's successful challenge. ""I'm a fan of the nba challenge rule, but if a play is overturned and they don't show the replay that justifies overturning a call along with an explanation then it's going to have real problems. From the angles we saw in arena it looked like a clean strip but body contact first."" GOOD TIME, LONG TIME Dallas' Kristaps Porzingis' 32 points marked the 15th time he has scored 30 or more, and the first since December 2017. For Portland, McCollum's 35 points were his most in a game since he scored 40 on Dec. 12, 2018. TIP-INS Blazers: F Zach Collins left the court holding his right shoulder in the third quarter. ... F/C Pau Gasol still hasn't played in his 18th season because of an injured left foot.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Andrew Wiggins has been the face of unfulfilled potential for the Minnesota Timberwolves, beginning his sixth NBA season and starting the second year of his $147 million maximum contract. The Timberwolves haven't come close to giving up on him, though, and Wiggins put on a late-game show in their home opener that provided another reminder of why they're counting on more progress. Wiggins made four 3-pointers and scored 16 of his 25 points in the final six minutes, propelling the undefeated Timberwolves to a 116-109 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday night. ""It's going to take time for all of it to come together with our emphasis and changing of systems, but he is going to have a good year,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""I'm in his corner, and I want to make sure he knows that."" How often does Wiggins hear that? ""Every day he's telling me I'm going to have a good year,"" he said. ""Just trust in the system."" Karl-Anthony Towns added 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Wolves (3-0), who matched the second-best start in this long-languishing franchise's history. They were 6-0 in 2001-02 and 3-0 in 2013-14. The Wolves have trailed in all three games, and Wiggins produced clutch contributions in two of them. ""He's a star player, and he knows when he has to kick it up,"" Towns said. ""For some reason, he always hits those shots at the end when we need him the most."" Kendrick Nunn had 25 points on 5-for-9 shooting from 3-point range, Duncan Robinson pitched in with 21 points, and Justise Winslow scored 20 for the Heat, who played again without new star Jimmy Butler and took their first loss after playing in Milwaukee the day before. ""That's two straight games where the first half really hurt us and we expended a lot of emotional energy,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""In the first half, we just didn't bring the necessary passion and communication."" After erasing a 21-point deficit in the third quarter to beat NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in overtime Saturday, the Heat didn't flinch after trailing by 13 at the end of the first quarter and facing a double-digit margin for most of the second period. Goran Dragic swished a 3-pointer for a 57-53 lead, capping an 18-2 run just before the break. The Heat had a lead as big as 84-74 on Robinson's 3-pointer late in the third quarter, but Towns answered from behind the arc in the final minute of that period to give the Wolves momentum. Adapting to a faster-paced, 3-point-friendly style under Saunders, they climbed back into striking range with stiffer defense before Wiggins delivered the decisive blows. ""I'm going to keep at it. Whenever they need me to make a play down the stretch, I'm going to give it my all to make a play,"" Wiggins said. After started the season 0 for 13 from long range, Wiggins had a well-timed first make with 5:52 left to tie the game at 96. He gave the Wolves the lead for good with 2:56 left, the first of three 3-pointers he hit in as many possessions. With 1:45 remaining, he simply dribbled back and forth on the left wing and, with Robinson trying to guard him, stepped back to swish the inevitable launch for a 110-101 edge that gave him 11 straight points. His teammates mobbed him on the court after the Heat called a timeout. ""If you're a scorer, you see the ball go in, you start to get some rhythm, now you can become a lot more dangerous,"" Spoelstra said. ""In the fourth quarter, basically you really have to treat everybody as a threat, regardless of where they are on the scouting report. You just can't give open looks."" TIP-INS Heat: With Butler out, Derrick Jones Jr. (groin) injured and Dion Waiters and James Johnson still away from the team for disciplinary reasons, the bench was thinned to six backups, including a pair of two-way players. Veteran forward Udonis Haslem (wrist) was active for the first time this season but did not play. ... The Heat went 10 for 15 from the free throw line, perpetuating a problem from last season. Timberwolves: After joining Kevin Garnett (1999-2000) as the only players in franchise history to post consecutive 30-point, 10-rebound games to start a season, Towns went 2 for 11 from the field after the first quarter. ... The Wolves have won four straight home openers. NUNN BETTER Nunn, one of four rookies on a Heat roster that's half-filled with under-25 players, has been quite the fill-in for Butler on the wing over his first three NBA games. Nunn came off the bench in the G League for the Santa Cruz Warriors last season, but he parlayed a strong Summer League performance for the Heat into a prominent spot in the rotation so far. NO JEERING JIMMY Butler became a father earlier this week when his girlfriend had a baby, his paternity leave delaying the debut for Miami's prize offseason addition. The crowd in Minnesota was also deprived of the now-annual opportunity to direct boos at Butler, who forced his way out a year ago after helping the Wolves in 2017-18 end a 13-season absence from the playoffs. The fans had their first chance to jeer last spring when Butler played here with Philadelphia.","401160681"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Lakers acquired two veteran NBA big men in the offseason, and they both got wild cheers for their outstanding performances Sunday night in a runaway win over Charlotte. That's no surprise in the case of Anthony Davis, who gave Lakers fans their best look yet at his world-class talent. In the case of Dwight Howard, it's a minor miracle how quickly he has landed in Los Angeles' good graces again. Davis had 29 points and 14 rebounds, and Howard added 16 points, 10 boards and four blocked shots in a 120-101 victory over the Hornets. LeBron James had 20 points, 12 assists and six rebounds for the Lakers, who took control of their second straight victory with an 18-2 rally starting late in the third quarter. But he was most excited afterward about their strong defensive performance and the potential for growth encapsulated in Davis and Howard. ""That's the luxury of our depth,"" James said. Davis showed off the breadth of his skills during a 25-point first half, scoring 16 points in the first quarter while dominating on both ends. After a sometimes-tentative start to his Lakers career, he was aggressive from the start against Charlotte's young frontcourt. ""I shot the ball poorly the first two games, and I was just trying to get into a rhythm,"" Davis said. ""When I get easy looks, it kind of gets me going."" When Davis took a step back after halftime, James and Howard took charge. That's what the Lakers' depth allows them to do in difficult matchups, even with these partnerships and connections still new in the third game of the season. While James orchestrated the offense, Howard put in an impressive all-around performance that drew multiple ovations from the same fan base that booed him relentlessly for the past six years after he left the Lakers in free agency. Now back as a reserve center, Howard has already turned the tide with his dunks, defense and overall effort in the team's first two home games. When Howard blocked a shot into the crowd and did a Mutombo finger-wag while flashing his famous smile, Lakers fans jumped from their seats to cheer. ""I wasn't thinking about anything but doing whatever I can to help the team win, keep the crowd energized,"" Howard said. ""Great things happen when you do that. I'm just going to keep doing whatever it takes and enjoy every moment on the court."" Miles Bridges scored 23 points, while Cody Zeller and Terry Rozier added 19 apiece for the Hornets in the opener of a four-game road trip. Charlotte's 1-for-12 shooting on 3-pointers in the third quarter allowed the Lakers to break it open. ""We were trying to get out in front of the situation, but they're a championship-level team,"" Bridges said. ""It was a close game. They've got veterans. They did what they did, and we showed our youth a little bit."" Bridges scored 15 points in the first half, but Los Angeles held the Hornets to 39 points after halftime. ""I thought we competed tonight,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""I thought we were great. ... (Bridges) really stood out to me tonight (with) his maturity, the way he's grown, the presence he has, the way he attacked them. He took on that challenge of guarding LeBron, and I thought he was great tonight."" AD'S OPENER Davis was dominant from the start, racking up his 16 points in the first quarter on 6-of-8 shooting. He hit three 3-pointers and grabbed six rebounds during his huge first half. He even persevered after Zeller and Davis accidentally elbowed each other in the face while fighting for a rebound with 2:10 to play. Zeller got a loose ball foul after a long video review, but he was in the Hornets' locker room getting help for a cut. QUIET START James didn't score his first points until he hit two free throws 1:40 before halftime, and he got his first field goal with a layup on LA's next possession. James was mostly a facilitator until the fourth quarter, when he scored his 10th point on a layup with 9:57 left. James hasn't been held under 10 points in a regular-season game since Jan. 5, 2007, although it also happened twice in the playoffs in the nearly 13 years since. TIP-INS Hornets: Devonte Graham converted a four-point play in the second quarter. He finished with nine points after scoring 23 and 24 in the Hornets' first two games. ... Nicolas Batum missed his second straight game with a broken finger on his left hand. The big man got hurt in Charlotte's season opener. Lakers: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope finished with 10 points after he ended his 0-for-11 start to the season from the field with three straight baskets in the second quarter. ... The backup point guards both played well. Quinn Cook had 12 points and eight assists, and Alex Caruso added five points and two assists.","401160682"
"DETROIT --  Derrick Rose made a driving layup with 28.3 seconds left to give Detroit the lead, and the Pistons went on to a 96-94 victory over winless Indiana on Monday night for their second win against the Pacers in less than a week. Rose shot just 4 of 16 from the field and was having a particularly tough time in the fourth quarter, but his left-handed layup went in off the glass to put Detroit up 95-94. Malcolm Brogdon missed at the other end, but Indiana got an offensive rebound. T.J. Warren then missed badly on a tough shot from the corner, and the Pistons came up with the ball. Luke Kennard made one of two free throws for Detroit, and Indiana had one more chance with 2 seconds left. Warren missed a 3-pointer from the left wing. Andre Drummond had 18 points and 18 rebounds for the Pistons, and Christian Wood had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Detroit led most of the game, but the Pacers erased a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter and led by four late. Kennard then got a fortunate bounce on a 3-pointer to make it 94-93, and Rose's basket gave the Pistons the lead. Domantas Sabonis had 21 points and 14 rebounds for Indiana, and Brogdon contributed 15 points and 11 assists. REPEAT Indiana entered the night one of five NBA teams without a victory. The Pacers are minus star guard Victor Oladipo, who is still working his way back from a right knee injury. But the Pistons are nowhere near full strength either -- Blake Griffin (hamstring and knee injuries) hasn't played yet this season -- and they've still beaten Indiana twice. TIP-INS Pacers: G Jeremy Lamb (right hip pointer) did not play. Pistons: Detroit was also without G Reggie Jackson (lower back tightness) and rookie F Sekou Doumbouya (concussion protocol). ... Former Pistons star Isiah Thomas was at the game, and the team announced it is teaming up with him on a champagne sponsorship deal.","401160683"
"NEW YORK --  Bobby Portis is over his anger at the Chicago Bulls, so Monday night wasn't about the need for revenge. All he wanted was a win, and he knew it wouldn't come until he started playing better. Portis scored a season-high 28 points against his former team, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:47 remaining, and the New York Knicks beat the Bulls 105-98 for their first victory of the season. Portis had totaled just 18 points in his first three games with the Knicks, but was superb in bringing New York back from an 18-point deficit. The reserve was 10 for 14, making all four 3-pointers, and added 11 rebounds. The 2015 first-round pick of the Bulls spent 3 1/2 seasons in Chicago before being traded last season to Washington. He played them three times after the trade, so he viewed them as just another team -- even though it appeared he turned and said something toward the Bulls bench after one of his baskets. ""I'm just an animated player. I don't know what I'm saying sometimes,"" Portis said. ""I just have fun. I love playing this game. ""I feel like I wasn't myself the first couple games and I didn't bring the energy, so I had to get back to being who I am."" The Knicks needed all of it on a night when they fell behind with a dreadful start and stayed that way until the fourth quarter. They never even led until Portis' go-ahead 3, which he followed with another 3 that pushed it to 103-98 during a 15-0 run to finish the game. ""I've always said that Bobby Portis is one of my favorite guys of all time,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""He's a tough, competitive guy who works and cares. We traded Bobby Portis because that's what happens in our league. It doesn't mean we're not fond of that player or don't believe in that player. There are situations when a deal works and you put a player in it. He played great tonight. I'm disappointed that we lost but I'm happy that he played well."" Rookie RJ Barrett added 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who had dropped their first three games. Kevin Knox II scored 14 points, and Julius Randle finished with 13 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. Zach LaVine scored 21 points for the Bulls, who fell to 1-3. Wendell Carter Jr. had 20 points and 10 rebounds -- and didn't buy that it was just another game for Portis. ""He was juiced about this game as soon as he came to New York,"" Carter said. ""He put on social media that he was looking forward to playing against the Chicago Bulls. We all knew that he was excited and very juiced, and he played a great game."" The Knicks missed 13 of their first 15 shots and quickly fell behind by double digits. The Bulls led 33-15 after one quarter and re-opened an 18-point cushion in the third quarter. After Portis made a 3-pointer to tie it at 88 with 6:09 to go, Chicago pushed ahead again. LaVine and Lauri Markkanen made consecutive 3-pointers to cap a 10-2 burst that made it 98-90 with about 3 1/2 minutes left, but the Knicks pitched a shutout from there. Fans chanted Portis' name in the final minute after booing the Knicks during their home opener two nights earlier. ""It was great. It was electric in there,"" Barrett said. ""Hopefully we get to have this feeling many more times."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago scored before any time had come off the clock in the third quarter. The Knicks' Marcus Morris was called for a technical foul as the first half ended, and LaVine made the technical free throw before the second half began. ... Markkanen scored 18 points. Knicks: The Knicks were without Dennis Smith Jr., who is away from the team because of a death in his family. Coach David Fizdale said he didn't know when Smith would rejoin the team, saying it was the guard's choice. ... Elfrid Payton left the game with a sore right hamstring. ... The Knicks said Al Bianchi died Monday in Arizona at 87. Bianchi was the Knicks' general manager from 1987-91. PERFECT NO MORE Otto Porter Jr., who was dealt to the Bulls from Washington in the Portis trade, lost for the first time as a pro at Madison Square Garden. He had been 7-0. RANDLE'S ROLL Randle has double-doubles in all four games, the longest streak by a player to begin his Knicks career since Zach Randolph did it in his first seven in 2007-08.","401160684"
"ATLANTA --  Joel Embiid missed the previous game with an ankle injury, and the Philadelphia 76ers weren't sure he'd be able to play Monday night until he tested it during warmups. He didn't seem to be in any pain. Embiid scored 36 points, including the winning free throws with 5.3 seconds left, and the 76ers won their third straight to begin the season with a 105-103 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. In a matchup between the last two unbeaten teams in the Eastern Conference, Philadelphia made things tough for Trae Young and dominated down the stretch to deny the young Hawks their first 3-0 start in three seasons. Embiid made 12 of 19 shots from the field -- including a couple of 3-pointers -- and knocked down all 10 of his free throws. He also had 13 rebounds, five assists and three steals. ""He was our crown jewel in a blatant way,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We needed him, particularly offensively."" The Hawks tied the game at 103 with 7.4 seconds left when John Collins tipped in a missed free throw by Young to complete a de facto three-point play after the Atlanta guard made his first attempt from the line. The 76ers had fouled Young before he could attempt a tying 3, but the Hawks wound up getting the points they needed when Al Horford failed to block out Collins, who flexed both arms on his way back down the court. After a timeout, Horford made up for his mistake by lobbing a pass to Embiid breaking loose in the lane. Collins fouled the 76ers big man to deny the basket, but Embiid calmly drained both free throws. The Hawks had one final chance, getting the ball to 42-year-old Vince Carter sprinting along the sideline. He threw up a wild 3 that never really had a chance, bouncing over the backboard as the horn sounded. Tobias Harris had eight of his 13 points in the final quarter as the 76ers outscored the Hawks 15-5 over the final five minutes. Josh Richardson chipped in with 14 points, and Ben Simmons also had 14. ""We have a lot of weapons,"" Embiid insisted. Young, the first Eastern Conference player of the week this season, had 25 points on 7-of-20 shooting. Collins added 16 points and De'Andre Hunter 14, including a 3 from the corner that gave the Hawks a 98-90 lead. Philadelphia dominated the rest of the way. Young averaged 38.5 points in Atlanta's first two games. He was held to six over the final two quarters by the 76ers. ""They were denying me the ball,"" he said. ""They got it out of my hands the whole game."" The 76ers made sure Young didn't get a chance on that final play. ""I had two defenders on me,"" he said. ""I couldn't get open."" INJURY REPORT Philadelphia's Shake Milton exited in the third quarter with a hyperextended left knee. He was injured on a drive to the basket when he stepped on an Atlanta player's foot and twisted his knee. Before that, Milton gave the 76ers a boost off the bench by scoring nine points. TIP-INS 76ers: Former Hawk Mike Scott was ejected in the second quarter for a flagrant foul on Atlanta's Damian Jones. Scott gave Jones a chest bump as the Hawks center was driving to the basket, sending him flying out of bounds. While the play didn't look especially egregious, officials upheld the call after checking the replay. Scott shook hands with Jones before leaving the court, stopping on his way to the locker room to give his wrist bands to young fans hanging over the railing. ... Philadelphia trailed by 13 midway through the opening quarter and didn't grab its first lead until late in the first half. The 76ers never led by more than four. ""We were soft in that first quarter,"" Embiid said. ""We just had to turn it on a little bit."" Hawks: No. 10 overall draft pick Cam Reddish hasn't made much of an impact in his first three NBA games. He has a total of 11 points. ... Carter played only 10 minutes but was on the court for key minutes down the stretch. ... Rookie C Bruno Fernando had the first double-figure scoring game of his career with 11 points. ... Collins fouled out on the play that led to Embiid's winning free throws.","401160685"
"TORONTO --  The Orlando Magic are the only NBA team still looking for their first 100-point game of the season. Another score in the 90s wasn't enough to stop the Toronto Raptors. Kyle Lowry got 10 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, Pascal Siakam added 24 and the Raptors withstood a late rally to beat the Magic 104-95 on Monday night for their third win in four games to start the year. Marc Gasol had 10 points and 10 rebounds, Fred VanVleet scored 14 and OG Anunoby added 12 as the Raptors won for the 10th time in 15 regular-season meetings with Orlando. Jonathan Isaac scored a career-high 24 points, Evan Fournier had 18 and Markelle Fultz 13 for the Magic, who have lost two straight. Ex-Raptor Terrence Ross scored 11 for Orlando, and D.J. Augustin had 10. Isaac and Fultz combined to shoot 13 for 21, but the rest of the Magic went 21 for 68. ""We've just got to stick to the plan,"" Isaac said. ""Guys haven't shot the ball great. I hit some shots tonight but I haven't shot the ball great. All of us, we just need to step up, make open shots and continue to trust the offense and we'll be OK."" Orlando center Nikola Vucevic finished 1 for 13 and scored five points in 25 minutes. He did not play in the fourth. ""Offensively, we can't get much going,"" Vucevic said. ""We need to figure it out sooner than later."" The Magic trailed 81-67 after VanVleet's three-point play to begin the final quarter, but Ross' 3-pointer with 4:18 to play capped a 13-0 run that gave Orlando an 89-87 lead, its first since being up 9-7. After a timeout, Siakam halted the run with a three-point play. Fultz replied with a reverse layup but Lowry hit a 3, then made a pair of free throws to put Toronto ahead 95-91 with 2:35 to go. ""That's a sign of us hanging in there real strong,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Lowry was later fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three at the line. Toronto went 13 for 13 on free throws in the fourth. ""Lowry scored six points on mistakes late,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""That was it."" After finishing 5 of 31 from 3-point range in Saturday's 103-99 loss to Atlanta, the Magic went 4 for 10 in the first quarter Monday. However, they shot 4 of 15 from inside the arc, missing 10 straight to begin the game. Isaac had three of Orlando's 3-pointers in the opening quarter. Siakam scored 11 points in the first and the Raptors were 6 of 13 from long range to lead 31-22 after one. Toronto shot 4 for 20 in the second, missing 11 straight before consecutive baskets from Lowry in the final 28 seconds, including a buzzer-beating reverse layup that gave the Raptors a 51-46 halftime lead. Gasol scored five points in an 11-2 Toronto run to start the third, and the Raptors took a 78-67 lead into the fourth. THROWBACK On the first of six nights scheduled to celebrate the Raptors' 25th anniversary season, Toronto wore its original warmups and pinstriped dinosaur jerseys. The game was played on a replica of the 1995 court, with 2-point territory shaded purple. FAMILIAR FOE Orlando beat Toronto in Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs last spring, but the Raptors bounced back to win the series in five games before going on to capture the first NBA title in franchise history. BAD MEMORY Vucevic said he couldn't recall enduring such a rough shooting performance. ""I don't remember going 1 for 13,"" he said. ""I don't think I've ever done that before."" UNDER 100 Toronto, which beat Chicago 108-84 Saturday, has held opponents below 100 points in back-to-back games. The Raptors did that three times last season.

"Russell Westbrook explains what it's like for him to have friends in the NBA and how when he's in the middle of a game, all those friendships go out the window. (0:38) HOUSTON --  After Russell Westbrook helped the Houston Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night in his first meeting against his former team he insisted there weren't different emotions in facing the guys he played with for so long. ""When I hoop I have no friends,"" he said. ""On the court they know not to talk to me."" But as soon as Westbrook finished saying that, he walked right down the hall and bounded into the visitor's locker room for a reunion with his former teammates. James Harden scored 40 points and Westbrook scored 21 and fell an assist shy of a triple-double as the Rockets got the 116-112 win. Some players seemed taken aback to see Westbrook in their locker room and a confused Dennis Schroder asked him what he was doing in there. Westbrook smiled and said: ""Same thing I've been doing, coming to check on my homies."" Westbrook had 12 rebounds and nine assists after notching his 139th triple-double in his last game to pass Magic Johnson for second-most all-time. A 3-pointer by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 19 seconds left got Oklahoma City within 3. Westbrook made 1 of 2 free throws before fouling Nerlens Noel, who made both free throws. But Harden, who was 21 of 22 from the line, made four free throws down the stretch to secure the victory. It was the first game between these teams since a blockbuster summer trade reunited Westbrook with Harden and sent Chris Paul to Oklahoma City after the nine-time All-Star failed to help the Rockets to a title in two seasons in Houston. Paul had 15 points, four assists and five rebounds. Just before tipoff, Westbrook approached the Thunder bench and hugged coach Billy Donovan before slapping hands and greeting virtually every player on the bench. Westbrook spent the first 11 years of his career in Oklahoma City where he was the face of the franchise before moving to Houston in the deal the Rockets hope will help bring them their first title since 1995. Gilgeous-Alexander had 22 points and Schroder added 22 points to lead the Thunder, who fell to 1-3. Houston used a 39-point third quarter to take an 11-point lead into the fourth quarter. ""We picked up our defensive intensity,"" Harden said. ""That's going to be what gets us over the top, what gets us where we want to go. We got a little lackadaisical in the first half. Second half we picked it up and look at the results."" The Rockets opened the third quarter with a 17-4 run to erase a 10-point halftime deficit and take a 69-66 lead with about seven minutes left in the quarter. A 3-pointer by Tucker put Houston on top and Westbrook punctuated the run with a dunk before screaming and flexing as he passed the Thunder bench. PAUL HONORED The Rockets honored Paul with a video tribute that recounted some of his Houston highlights during a timeout in the first quarter. Paul got a huge ovation at the end of the video and smiled and waved to the crowd when he was shown on the Jumbotron. ""Extremely grateful,"" he said of the tribute. ""The fans here were always great to me and my family ... some of the people here became like family to me and I try to stay in touch with those who were as genuine as could be.""

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks were in a serious mood Monday night after a loss to Miami in their home opener over the weekend. Khris Middleton scored 21 points and the Bucks used a strong finish to hold off the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-112. Middleton scored 10 points in a late 28-12 run and seven Milwaukee (2-1) players finished in double figures. ""Khris really kind of put the nail in the coffin with a couple of his finishes,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He's a big shot-maker and closer."" Cleveland had pulled within 96-91 on a Tristan Thompson dunk with 9:26 remaining, but Milwaukee responded. Point guard Eric Bledsoe had six points as the Bucks went up by 12, and Middleton hit a pair of 3-pointers, the second one giving Milwaukee a 124-103 lead with 2:50 remaining. On a relatively quiet night for Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo (14 points on 5-of-15 shooting and 10 rebounds), Milwaukee got a huge boost from reserves George Hill and Pat Connaughton. Hill had 19 points and Connaughton scored 17, including 14 in the first half. ""We play great together; we have great continuity,"" Connaughton said. ""For us, it's about making sure we bring the energy and winning plays and do our job."" Brook Lopez had 16 points and Wesley Matthews and Bledsoe each added 14 for Milwaukee. Cleveland (1-2) was led by guard Collin Sexton with 18 points, and Tristan Thompson and Jordan Clarkson each had 17. ""This is a great team,"" Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. said. ""They're probably picked to come out of the East this year. ""So to play on their court and battle them down to near the last minute is positive. ""We put a lot of emphasis on Giannis, but that's what makes this team great. You take him out of it or at least contain him to a certain extent, and the other guys stepped up. Pat, G. Hill, Kyle (Korver). That's what makes these guys tough to beat."" The Bucks sank 17 of 38 attempts from 3-point range (44.7%), with Connaughton going 4 of 5 beyond the arc and Middleton hitting 3 of 5. ""They've been averaging 50 (three-point attempts) and they only got 38 off,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""They got some really good open ones but that's because they're veterans. There's a reason why they're contenders for the NBA championship."" Milwaukee trailed 31-30 after the first quarter, but rallied to take a 59-52 halftime lead. Connaughton scored 11 points in the second quarter. Hill, obtained from the Bucks in a trade with Cleveland last December, hit 7 of 10 shots and added eight rebounds and three assists. ""I think the first two games I was being very passive and unselfish and trying to make the right play instead of just playing basketball,"" Hill said. ""I'm just trying to make an impact on both ends."" Antetokounmpo scored 30 points while posting a triple-double in the Bucks' season-opening win at Houston and had 29 in the overtime loss to Miami. But he wasn't worried about being limited to 14 against Cleveland while dishing out seven assists. ""I'm just trying to be aggressive,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""One of the things I do well is finding others open shots. If I see a guy open, I just want to pass it on the money and hopefully he'll knock it down."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Former Bucks player John Henson played 8 minutes (3 points, 3 rebounds) in Cleveland's 110-99 victory over Indiana on Saturday, but suffered a strained right hamstring that could sideline him for a month. The Cavaliers acquired him from Milwaukee in a three-team deal last December, but he was out the rest of the season following wrist surgery. Henson and Ante Zizic (left foot plantar fasciitis) were out. ... Beilein is quite familiar with Bucks forward D.J. Wilson, who played for him at Michigan. ""He's got so many tools with his length and overall ability,"" Beilein said. ""He can shoot; he can pass. Finding his place and staying healthy and all those things are going to be key for him."" Bucks: Foul woes plagued Milwaukee in its first two games, and Antetokounmpo fouled out of both contests. Opponents are doing their best to draw fouls on the Bucks star or force a call by the officials. ""I haven't picked up on a strategy,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think Giannis can be more disciplined. He knows that. I have a ton of confidence that he can self-correct."" Antetokounmpo had two fouls in 29 minutes on Monday.","401160688"
"Steph Curry talks about what it feels like to have the first win of the season, citing the critics who doubted the Warriors and threw ""darts"" after a slow start. (0:34) NEW ORLEANS -- Draymond Green turned in the all-court performance the Golden State Warriors needed to secure their first victory of the season, and then said what he felt was necessary to preserve maximum humility and hunger in the locker room. ""We're still not a very good team,"" Green said. Green had 16 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists, leading the Warriors to a 134-123 victory over winless New Orleans on Monday night. Stephen Curry had 26 points, 11 assists and three steals for Golden State, which dropped its first two games by 19 or more points before dominating a Pelicans squad that was missing three injured starters, including top overall draft choice Zion Williamson. ""We got to continue to compete at a high level. The first two nights we didn't do that. Tonight we did,"" Green said, stressing the Warriors have seven players with three or fewer years of experience in the NBA. ""As leaders of this team, we continue to try to bring it every night and give them something to follow and, you know, we'll win some games."" D'Angelo Russell added 24 points, and Damion Lee set career highs with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Green's layup with 5:07 left put the Warriors ahead 128-99 before the Pelicans made an inconsequential run to make the final score look more competitive than the bulk of the game was. ""We were never in the game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We never had any chance at all to win and I think that's the most disturbing thing to me -- especially playing at home."" Brandon Ingram had 27 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who had not lost any of their first three games by more than seven points before being run out of their own building by the Curry and Co. The Pelicans were playing a second straight game without veteran guard Jrue Holiday, who has a sprained left knee, and also were without starting center Derrick Favors because of right knee soreness. ""We have enough guys in here where we feel like we can win basketball games,"" Ingram said. ""We won't get discouraged at all."" TIP-INS Warriors: Glen Robinson III had 12 points and nine assists. ... Kevon Looney missed his second straight game with right hamstring tightness, while Alec Burks (right ankle sprain), Willie Cauley-Stein (left foot sprain) and Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) have yet to make their season debut. Pelicans: Lonzo Ball had 12 points and nine assists. ... First-round draft pick Jaxson Hayes had 19 points in his Pelicans debut. ... Kenrich Williams scored 16 points and rookie Nickeil Alexander-Walker, picked 17th overall, had 15 points and nine assists. ... Veteran guard E'Twaun Moore did not play for a third straight game despite being healthy. NEW REALITY Curry said he and Green are accepting more complicated roles on a team that is trying to assimilate an infusion of youth. ""It's going to be a theme of the season -- we have to fight for everything we get this year and it may not be pretty,"" Curry said. ""It's not only do we have to perform every night, (but) for lack of a better term, you've got to teach."" ""We accept that challenge and that responsibility,"" Curry added. FIRST IMPRESSION Hayes debuted as a reserve, playing almost 24 minutes and pleasing the crowd with several dunks, including one on a long alley-oop pass from Ball. ""It felt great finally being out there and being able to play,"" Hayes said. ""We just have so many new people. I feel like just getting used to playing with each other, learning the defense, all that type of stuff will just help a lot more."" OFF THE MARK New Orleans went 15 of 47 (31.9 percent) from 3-point range and missed 10 of 22 free throws. J.J. Redick had a rough night for the Pelicans. The normally reliable veteran missed nine of 10 shots, including eight of nine from 3.","401160689"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Portland point guard Damian Lillard refused to give up when all seemed lost, and nearly willed the Trail Blazers to an improbable win over the San Antonio Spurs. DeMar DeRozan scored 27 points and San Antonio overcame a sluggish start and Lillard's hot finish to beat Portland 113-110 Monday night to remain undefeated. San Antonio is 3-0 for the eighth time in its 43-year history, but this outcome was in doubt until Lillard's 3-pointer from the right corner bounced in and out as time expired. ""We were on him,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He made shots. He drove it too easily, that's for sure. We didn't stay in front of him very well down the stretch, but he's a great player. He put it on himself to just take it and attack the rim and he did and we didn't stay in front of him very well."" Lillard had 28 points, including 18 straight in the final four minutes, as Portland erased a 15-point deficit. The 6-foot-3 guard was limited to 10 points on 3-for-16 shooting through three quarters before going 6 for 12 in the fourth. ""I'm not going to shy away because of that or try to go away and say, `Alright, it's just not my night,' "" Lillard said. ""I'm going to empty it and I'm going to go out swinging."" He almost took down San Antonio by himself. The Spurs seemed poised for a comfortable win after narrow victories against New York and Washington, but nearly let the game get away by closing out the contest as sloppily as they opened. Lillard took the Blazers on an 18-2 run, capped by a pair of 3s to close within 107-104 with 1:57 remaining. A dunk by Lillard cut the margin to a point, 109-108, with 1:10 left. Lillard and Anthony Tolliver missed consecutive 3-point attempts with Portland trailing 113-100. DeRozan missed a pair of free throws, setting up Lillard's final shot. ""You can never count a guy like Damian out,"" DeRozan said. ""He could get it going and missed shots are not going to deter him from trying to get it going. You've got to be aware and he got it going. Thank God we got bailed out."" San Antonio outscored Portland 30-27 in the third quarter after scoring just 19 points in the first period. The Blazers had a torrid start despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back and escaping with a 121-119 victory in Dallas on Sunday. CJ McCollum added 27 points for the Blazers (2-2). Derrick White added 21 points, LaMarcus Aldridge had 15 and Bryn Forbes 14. TIP-INS Blazers: Portland had an 11-man roster available, but coach Terry Stotts opted not to play Nassir Little or Gary Trent Jr. ... Former Spurs center Pau Gasol has not played this season for the Blazers as he continues to rehabilitate from left foot surgery in May. ... Bazemore finished with three points and three rebounds in 24 minutes before fouling out. Spurs: San Antonio has the fewest days with a losing record in the last 23 years, falling under .500 for 65 days. ... The Spurs will play on the road for the first time this season, taking on former San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers in Los Angeles on Thursday. STAYING PUT Popovich said Dejounte Murray's minutes will remain restricted after he missed last season following right ACL surgery in July 2018. Murray will not play in back-to-back games and will be limited to about five minutes per quarter. Murray had seven points and eight assists in 22 minutes against the Blazers. Popovich said he was not tempted to put Murray back in the game in the fourth quarter to help defensively as Lillard went on his 18-point run. ""No, he's on a minute restriction,"" Popovich said. ""Either he's on a minute restriction or he's not. One game isn't that important to put him out there when the docs feel he shouldn't be.""","401160690"
"PHOENIX --  Donovan Mitchell would have loved to end the game with some sort of highlight-reel dunk or step-back 3-pointer that would be replayed over and over again on television for the next 24 hours. But it wasn't that kind of night for the Utah Jazz. A physical drive, a drawn foul and a clutch free throw would have to do. Mitchell scored 25 points, including the game-winning foul shot with 0.4 seconds left, and the Jazz rallied to beat the Phoenix Suns 96-95 on Monday. ""It's me just attacking, coming downhill,"" Mitchell said. ""(Jevon) Carter was a great defender all game, but I just made a move and tried to get to the free throw line. I didn't do that much in the second half, but I did on the final play."" Mitchell took the ball in the backcourt in the final seconds and then drove through the lane past Carter, getting fouled by Devin Booker as he tried to make a layup. Mitchell sank the first free throw before missing the second, and Frank Kaminsky III's last-second heave was well short. Bojan Bogdanovic led the Jazz with 29 points on 8-of-13 shooting, including 4 for 8 from 3-point range. Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 18 rebounds and made 11 of 12 free throws. Utah won despite shooting just 38 percent from the field and committing 23 turnovers. The Jazz made up for it with good defense, especially in the final minutes. ""We didn't put our heads down after those mistakes. Got back and really worked to get stops,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""When you do that, you have a chance. We had some really big plays down the stretch."" The teams were tied at 70 heading into the fourth quarter before the Suns pushed ahead with five straight points. The game was tied again when Bogdanovic scored on a fast-break layup and was fouled with 1:45 left. He made the free throw to give the Jazz a 95-92 lead. Phoenix (2-2) was led by Booker's 21 points. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 and Carter had 15, including a 3-pointer that tied it at 95 with less than a minute left. Aron Baynes scored 12 for the Suns, including a career-high three 3-pointers. He made just 25 shots from beyond the arc in his first seven seasons, including 21 last year. Ricky Rubio faced Utah (3-1) for the first time since signing a free-agent deal with the Suns in the offseason. He finished with 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. ""I like how in the tough moments we get together and play with passion,"" Rubio said. ""The only difference not making the playoffs or making it is winning these kinds of games. I know we are young, we are learning, but we have to close out."" Both teams struggled to make shots in the first half as the Jazz built a 46-39 lead. Bogdanovic led Utah with 14 points. MORE THAN 0.4 SECONDS? Phoenix coach Monty Williams thought Mitchell got fouled with 1.8 seconds left instead of 0.4, which made it nearly impossible to get a last-second shot toward the rim. The call was not reviewed. Williams said that was frustrating, but it wasn't his team's biggest problem. ""That is a tough one to swallow but that wasn't the reason we lost,"" he said. ""Our ball movement was stagnant tonight."" TIP-INS Jazz: Dante Exum was out with a right knee injury. ... Utah outrebounded Phoenix 35-22 in the first half. ... Mitchell was called for a flagrant 1 foul in the third quarter after trying to fight around a screen by Baynes. Suns: Rubio returned after missing one game with a bruised left knee. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Jamal Murray took the blame for another slow start by Denver's offense and quickly pointed out how well the Nuggets have been playing defensively. ""Our defense has been our anchor,"" Murray said. ""It's been what's won us (games). Guys have to know we're a defensive team first. We can all score. We can all shoot. But defense is clearly how to win games."" Murray scored 14 points of his 18 points in the second half, including four in the final 31 seconds, Gary Harris added a pair of late free throws and the Nuggets held on after nearly blowing a big lead in the fourth quarter, beating the winless Sacramento Kings 101-94 on Monday night. The Nuggets (3-0) shook off a sluggish first half when they shot 17 of 52, took control in the third quarter with a stifling defense that repeatedly forced Sacramento into contested shots from the perimeter, then held off a late rally by the Kings to remain unbeaten. ""I challenged our guys to be a lot more physical and make them feel us,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""We didn't change our game plan. We just changed how hard and how physical we were playing. This was another night our offense struggled, but some guys stepped up and made big plays down the stretch."" Harris scored 17 points as Denver won its fifth straight against Sacramento. Nikola Jokic had nine points on 4-for-15 shooting with 13 rebounds and Will Barton added 13 points and nine rebounds. Denver led comfortably midway through the fourth quarter before Holmes scored five points as part of a 10-0 run that cut the Nuggets' lead to 90-88. Holmes later scored on a soaring one-handed dunk that made it 95-92, before Murray's deep shot just inside the 3-point line. After Barnes scored on a putback, Harris and Murray each hit two free throws. ""I came out more aggressive,"" said Murray, who missed five of his first six shots. ""That's something I have to change with myself from the jump. I can't just kind of be a part of the offense. I have to be aggressive and create for guys. That's what I did in the second half."" Richaun Holmes had 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Kings (0-4). De'Aaron Fox added 20 points and nine assists, and Harrison Barnes and Nemanja Bjelica each scored 12. First-year Sacramento coach Luke Walton felt his team made progress despite the loss, particularly defensively. ""That's what we have to be,"" Walton said. ""That's why we stress, and there was a point made, becoming a team that comes on defense so that when we have off shooting nights we still have a chance to win.  We really played a competitive game and we stuck together."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver outscored Sacramento 30-17 in the third quarter. ... Murray and Barton were a combined 2 of 12 in the first half when Denver shot 32.7% from the floor. Kings: The last time Sacramento started 0-4 was in 2008-09, when Reggie Theus was the coach. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard is only four games into his tenure back home in Los Angeles, and Paul George is still several games away from his Clippers debut. Everybody is still getting to know each other on this reconfigured roster. The Clippers have enough talent to keep stacking victories during this introductory process -- particularly against teams like the Charlotte Hornets, who have even more work to do. Leonard had 30 points, seven rebounds and six assists, and Lou Williams scored 23 points one day after his 33rd birthday in Los Angeles' 111-96 victory over Charlotte on Monday night. Montrezl Harrell scored eight of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, and Landry Shamet added 16 in the Clippers' third win in four games to start a season with championship aspirations. After following up their impressive season-opening victories over the Lakers and the Warriors with a shocking 130-122 loss to the Phoenix Suns two days ago, the Clippers managed to play enough defense in the second half to secure a comfortable win over the young Hornets. Their last two performances have been nowhere near complete, but the Clippers are working through it. ""There's so many things that we can get better in,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""And you just see them, like screening, timing, knowing where each other is at. There's so many new parts on the floor, and I just feel like we're nowhere near what we're going to be. Not even close, and that's a good thing. But during that time, you've still got to win games. You're in the West. You've just still got to tick off wins."" The Clippers pulled away with a 16-5 run spanning the final two quarters, stretching their lead to 96-79 with 7  1/2 minutes to play. Charlotte made an 11-2 surge, cutting the lead to single digits on Miles Bridges' 3-pointer with 4:16 left, but Harrell and Williams made big shots down the stretch. ""We've got to come in every game with a defensive hat on first, and we did that tonight,"" Leonard said. ""It's still early. We've got a long road ahead of us. We're still building chemistry, getting to know each other on the floor. I wouldn't say we're there yet. We've got to keep going."" Terry Rozier had 17 points to lead six Hornets scoring in double figures in the second game of a four-game trip. Devonte Graham had 14 points and 12 assists, while Cody Zeller added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte, which has lost three straight after a season-opening win over Chicago. ""I like the way we competed against two of the better teams in the league,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""We played even better tonight. Probably our best performance of the year defensively."" Indeed, Charlotte appeared to have more favorable defensive matchups against these Staples Center co-tenants than they did against the Lakers. But one night after the Hornets managed only 39 points in the second half of a loss to the Lakers, they scored only 42 in the second half against the Clippers. ""I feel like we're growing,"" Graham said. ""Even (against the Lakers), I feel like we took a step. We came out tonight to fight and be aggressive, but they did a good job on us in the second half."" RECENT EDGE The Clippers have won 10 straight over the Hornets at Staples Center since February 2009. Los Angeles has won 10 of its last 11 overall against Charlotte. KAWHI'S ASSISTS Leonard has added improved playmaking skills to his already formidable offensive arsenal since arriving in LA. Two days after setting a career high with 10 assists in Phoenix -- which surpassed his previous career high of nine, set two days before that against Golden State -- he had five in the first half against Charlotte, including a sublime bounce pass through traffic to Ivica Zubac shortly before halftime.

"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler made his first four shots and scored 21 in his Miami debut, rookie Tyler Herro scored 29 and the Heat defeated Atlanta 112-97 on Tuesday night in a game where Hawks star Trae Young left early in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle. The 19-year-old Herro had a 19-point second quarter for Miami, while fellow reserve Goran Dragic scored 21. Bam Adebayo had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Miami and Kendrick Nunn finished with 17.. Young left with 9:56 remaining in the first half, turning his ankle when he landed on the foot of Miami's Justise Winslow. The reigning Eastern Conference player of the week -- who had 102 points in Atlanta's first three games -- finished with five points in 11 minutes. John Collins scored 30 for Atlanta, including a career-best five 3-pointers, and Jabari Parker finished with 12 for the Hawks. Butler missed the first three games of the season while celebrating the birth of his daughter Rylee. He was 5 for 11 from the floor, and went 10 for 15 from the line. As a team, Miami was 33 for 45 from the line -- compared with 16 for 24 by Atlanta at the stripe. ""To win at home, in front of these fans, is special,"" Butler said. Even without Young, even with Kevin Huerter -- a starter last season -- on a minutes restriction while he works his way back off knee soreness and with Evan Turner out with a sore Achilles, the Hawks still wouldn't go away late. Tyrone Wallace made a pair of free throws to get Atlanta within 11 with 3:24 left, but the Hawks missed shots at the rim on their next two possessions and Miami put the game away. Herro set a Heat record for points off the bench by a rookie, topping the mark of 28 set by Michael Beasley on March 4, 2009. And Herro and Dragic became the ninth Heat duo all-time to have 20-point games off the Miami bench on the same night. TIP-INS Hawks: Vince Carter played in Miami for the 35th time, finishing with seven points and became the fourth visiting player to score 700 in road games against the Heat -- including playoffs. He now has 702 and joined Paul Pierce (867), Patrick Ewing (754) and Michael Jordan (722) in that club. ... Atlanta plays its next four games at home. Heat: Miami's 472 points through four games is a franchise-high. The previous high was 447 in 2012-13. ... Miami is 3-1 for the first time since the 2014-15 season.

"DENVER --  With their superstars held in check, the Dallas Mavericks relied on their supporting cast. They put on quite a show and helped hand Denver its first loss of the season. Maxi Kleber had 14 points, seven rebounds and a key block late, and Dallas overcame off nights from Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic to beat the Nuggets 109-106 on Tuesday night. Dallas had nine players score double figures, tying a franchise record, on a night their two top scorers combined for 22 points on 7 of 26 shooting. Doncic scored 12 points and Kristaps Porzingis had 10 points and 14 rebounds. No Mavericks player scored more than 14 points. ""It demonstrates the importance of having a deep roster,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Denver is very deep. We're deep and we're going to use our guys."" Doncic and Porzingis were also cold from deep, missing 12 of 14 from 3-point range. Porzingis was 1 for 8 and Doncic hit 1 of 6 and missed three free throws. ""We did a great job on those guys but the other guys got off,"" said Gary Harris, who shadowed Doncic most of the game. ""We can't allow that to happen. Those guys really hurt us today."" Nikola Jokic had his second triple-double of the season, with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and Paul Millsap had a season-high 23 points and eight rebounds. Will Barton scored 19 but it wasn't enough to prevent Denver from losing the second game of a back-to-back set. ""We couldn't get stops when we needed. Too many layups, too many broken assignments,"" Millsap said. ""We just weren't disciplined enough."" The Mavericks rallied from 11 down in the third quarter on the strength of their support players. They did most of their damage after Denver took a nine-point lead late in the third quarter. Tim Hardaway Jr., who finished with 14 points, hit three 3-pointers and Dorian Finney-Smith two during a 30-10 run that gave Dallas a 103-94 lead midway through the fourth quarter. The Nuggets chipped away at the lead and got within 107-106 on Harris' 3-pointer and appeared to take the lead with 1:05 left when Kleber was called for goaltending on Jamal Murray's layup. The officials quickly reviewed the play and overturned the call, keeping Dallas ahead 107-106. ""It's an automatic trigger; any goaltending in the last two minutes that's called is automatically reviewed,"" Carlisle said. ""It was pretty clear from my vantage point that it was going to be overturned."" Doncic hit a driving layup and Jokic lost the ball out of bounds with 29.2 seconds left. After Doncic missed two free throws Murray, who had 16 points, was hounded by Finney-Smith and missed everything on his 3-point attempt with 3.8 seconds left. ""I knew he was looking for a 3 so if he was going to get a shot off I just wanted it to be contested,"" Finney-Smith said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic took a shot to the side midway through the first quarter when he collided with Gary Harris going or a loose ball. He was bent over before a timeout but stayed in the game. ... C Dwight Powell made his season debut after missing the first three games with a left hamstring strain. He finished with four points in 13:34 of action. Nuggets: Millsap's previous season high was 11. He had that many in the first 3:34 of the game. ... Denver was 12-1 in the second of back-to-back games last season. BIG EASY Kleber finished with three blocks and one steal to go along with his 14 points. ""Kleber catches people by surprise because they don't see him and all of a sudden he's blocking a shot,"" Carlisle said. ""Sometimes it can elicit a whistle that blown by a referee who has never seen something like that before."" Kleber has earned the respect of his teammates. ""He's a great defender,"" Doncic said. ""He can do a lot of things. It wasn't just that play.""","401160695"
"LOS ANGELES --  Anthony Davis is four games into his first season with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he's already in good company. Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, George Mikan, Shaquille O'Neal -- and now AD. Davis had the fourth 40-point, 20-rebound game of his seven-year career and set a franchise record with 26 made free throws as the Lakers rallied in the second half for a convincing 120-91 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. He joined those Laker greats as LA players to get 40 points and 20 rebounds. ""It's an honor to be on that list with those legends but more important is we got the win,"" said Davis, who was 26 of 27 from the line. ""It was a grind in the first half and my teammates trusted me. I just tried to be a monster on the glass."" It is Davis' first 40-20 game since 2016. He's the first Laker to do it since O'Neal in 2003. Davis played only 31 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he is the first player to have a 40-20 game in 31 minutes or less since 1954-55. Prior to Davis, the quickest 40-20 game was 33 minutes by Baylor in 1961. Davis is also the fourth player in league history and first since Michael Jordan in 1987 to make 26 or more free throws. ""This solidifies why we went out and got him. He was big time for us,"" said LeBron James, who scored 23 points for the Lakers. Los Angeles is off to its first 3-1 start since winning its first eight in 2010. Davis was questionable two hours before the game due to a right shoulder injury suffered in Sunday's win over Charlotte. He did some dribbling and shooting on the court before being cleared. Davis had 16 points and nine rebounds in the first quarter but went back to the locker room at the start of the second to get the shoulder checked and re-taped. Coach Frank Vogel thought he might have to go the rest of the game without Davis until he saw him come back to the bench. ""He gutted it out playing in some pain and was dominant. They didn't have an answer and he was terrific,"" Vogel said. Los Angeles trailed for most of the first half but took a 49-47 lead into the locker room at halftime when Davis grabbed a rebound, drove down the court and tipped in his own miss at the buzzer. The Grizzlies (1-3) led 65-59 with seven minutes remaining in the third quarter when the Lakers went on a 27-2 run to close out the quarter. Davis scored 16 points during the rally, with all but two coming at the line. The final 10 Lakers' points in the quarter came via Davis' free throws. ""Everyone was playing well,"" Davis said. ""I was just trying to be aggressive. It was a close game until the third quarter. I knew some of their players were in foul trouble and tried to get them out of the game. "" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins agreed with Davis' sentiment, saying ""I thought he was super aggressive, and you are rewarded when you are aggressive."" Davis said his shoulder was still sore after the game, but he thinks it will improve since the Lakers have a couple days off. Memphis raced to a 15-2 lead before Los Angeles started to work its way back. Ja Morant led the Grizzlies with 16 points, and Jonas Valanciunas added 14 points and 11 boards. Morant, who was the second pick in the June draft, had only three points in the first half before finding his groove in the second. ""Coming into an environment like this we have to play all four quarters,"" Morant said. ""It was wow moment coming in (facing James and Davis) but I was still trying to go out and play my game."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis finished 22 of 23 from the line but was 7 of 34 on 3-pointers. ... Grayson Allen came off the bench to score 13 points. ... Dillon Brooks' four-point play early in the first quarter was the third of his career. That ties him with Shane Battier and Troy Daniels for second in franchise history behind Mike Conley's seven. Lakers: Avery Bradley had 12 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 11, with all but one coming in the fourth quarter. ... Los Angeles finished 33 of 39 on free throws.","401160696"
"CLEVELAND -- A year after losing their first six games, the Cleveland Cavaliers are putting a scare into other people during the first week of this season. Kevin Love, who had 17 points and 20 rebounds in Cleveland's 117-111 over Chicago on Wednesday night, went with the Halloween theme while sitting at his locker talking to reporters following the game. Love donned a hockey mask in honor of Jason, the evil character from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. He also arrived at the arena before the game wearing the mask. ""I know my scary movies,"" said Love. ""That's my favorite scary movie."" Cleveland, which has split its first four games didn't get its second win until its 13th game last season. Love and Tristan Thompson, who had 23 points 10 rebounds, have had double-doubles in each of Cleveland's four games. ""We're just feeding off each other,"" Love said. ""We talk every day that we need to set the tone for the rest of the team."" Love's basket on a goal-tending call on Lauri Markkanen gave Cleveland a 91-90 lead early in the tightly played fourth quarter. His jumper from the left wing put the Cavaliers ahead 110-106 with just under a minute to play. Collin Sexton, who sat most of the third quarter because of foul trouble, scored 10 points in the final eight minutes, including a dunk over Chicago center Wendell Carter Jr. following an assist from Love on Cleveland's next possession. Cleveland's first-year coach John Beilein's goal to establish a homecourt advantage for his rebuilding team is off to a good start. The Cavaliers won their home opener over Indiana and rallied to beat the Bulls. ""We talked about that today,"" Beilein said. ""We want it to be special for us. The goal always is to win at home. We want to continue that trend to have people watch us grow."" Sexton had 18 points, a day after the Cavaliers exercised his third-year contract option. Markkanen and Zach LaVine each scored 16 points for Chicago, which has lost three straight. Carter and Otto Porter Jr. added 15 apiece. The Bulls, who allowed 15 consecutive points in the fourth quarter of Monday's loss to New York, saw another game get away. ""As the game went on, their energy grew and ours didn't,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""They drove it at us and they rebounded us and brought the physicality you need in the fourth quarter. We battled, but we haven't played as well in key moments as I hoped they would."" Chicago went on a 15-0 run to take a 21-11 lead in the first quarter, but led only 53-50 at halftime. Sexton picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter and sat out most of the period. Cleveland hit five 3-pointers, including three by Cedi Osman. Jordan Clarkson was fouled while making a 3-pointer from the corner and converted the free throw. TIP-INS Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison (strained left hamstring), who is rehabilitating his injury with the G-League's Windy City Bulls, will rejoin the team Thursday in order to gauge his progress. ... C Cristiano Felicio was a healthy inactive for the fifth straight game. He is the only player on the roster not to play a minute this season. Cavaliers: Love tied a franchise record for rebounds in a half with 16 in the first two quarters. ... Rookie G Dylan Windler has increased his activity as he returns from a stress reaction in his lower left leg that occurred before training camp. Windler, taken with the 26th pick of the first round, is shooting and participating in on-court drills. MAJOR SLAM Sexton, who is listed at 6-foot-1, dunked over the 6-10 Carter during Cleveland's spurt that clinched the game, a highlight that surely will be replayed countless times. ""I was going to try and lay it in and I thought, I might as well dunk it,"" Sexton said. TIME TO WIN Carter started and played 27 minutes, despite waking up in the morning with eye inflammation. ""You hear people talking about us being a playoff team, but that's all people hollering about something that's really far away,"" he said after the Bulls fell to 1-4. ""We need to focus on winning the next game.""","401160697"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic's shooting woes continue early in the season. So has their dogged defense. Nikola Vucevic scored 21 points and had 14 rebounds and Aaron Gordon scored 10 of his 15 points in the final five minutes of the game to help Orlando beat New York 95-83 on Wednesday night to end a two-game losing streak. Evan Fournier added 14 points, Jonathan Isaac had 10 and Orlando finished on a 16-3 run. The Magic limited New York to just one basket and one free throw in the final eight minutes to rally from an 80-79 deficit. Orlando allowed the Knicks just one of 11 shooting and forced three turnovers in that game-deciding stretch. ""We're trying to find our way offensively, but I do believe we had great defensive talent on this roster,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Through these first 10-12 games, we can defend and compete our way through until we get our offense going. That's what we did tonight."" The defense was very much needed. Orlando, the worst shooting team in the NBA going into the game, had a nice run in the third quarter -- hitting 13 of 20 shots -- but the rest of the game was a struggle. Gordon had only five points when he nailed a 3-pointer that ignited the Magic's fourth quarter rally. After a Vucevic layup, Gordon drilled another 3-pointer, a follow shot and capped the run with a reverse dunk. It was his most impressive offensive stretch in the young season. ""It was part of the process of getting to the open spots, being in the right place and trusting my teammates,"" Gordon said. ""They made great passes that allowed me to shoot the shots in rhythm."" Julius Randle led New York with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Mitchell Robinson had 12 points, all in the first half, and Bobby Portis added 12. The Knicks withstood Orlando's offensive surge in the third quarter by scoring the last 10 points of the period. New York, which trailed by 15 at one point in the quarter, erased the last of that deficit when Portis hit a 3-pointer to put the Knicks up 80-79 with 8:05 left in the game. However, there wasn't much offense to talk about after that. ""Two things happened in the fourth quarter: we didn't come up with loose balls and the ball stopped moving,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""It was a trust factor. In tight situations, you've got to share the ball. When the ball stops moving for us, it's death."" The Magic, who have struggled with their shooting in every game, entered the game last in the NBA in shooting percentage, lived down to that reputation in the first half, hitting just 15 of 45 shots. No Magic player reached double figures in the first half, but New York couldn't make them pay for it. The Knicks, playing without their two top point guards, Dennis Smith Jr. and Elfrid Payton, got an unexpected 12 points from Robinson in the first half, but not much else from his teammates. New York did take a 44-42 into halftime. TIP INS Knicks: F Marcus Morris had four blocked shots in the first half. ... F Julius Randle has a double-double in every game this season. Magic: Orlando hasn't scored 100 points in a game this season. ... The Magic outrebounded the Knicks 52-44. ... The Magic limited New York to just 26.3 percent shooting (5 of 19) in the fourth quarter. LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN Frank Ntilikina was the only point guard available for the Knicks Wednesday, but Coach David Fizdale declined to start him because he said was afraid Ntilikina would get in foul trouble. Ntilikina, who hadn't scored in 25 minutes this season, came in at the 5:29 mark of the first quarter and hit three of his first four shots, including a 32-footer at the buzzer.  However, he didn't make another shot the rest of the game. He finished with two personal fouls.","401160698"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns got into a brawl that overshadowed a rout on the court. Embiid scored 19 points before he was ejected for fighting with Towns, and the Philadelphia 76ers cruised to a 117-95 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night for their fourth straight win to begin the season. The Sixers were leading 75-55 midway through the third quarter when Embiid and Towns went at it. The two big men have a history of talking trash to each other. After they got tangled under the basket, Embiid shoved Towns, who answered with a punch that missed as both men fell to the floor. Ben Simmons jumped in and forcefully held Towns down as other players and coaches ran onto the court to separate everyone. ""I didn't throw any punches, so I shouldn't get suspended,"" Embiid said. Embiid and Towns were tossed after a video review. ""We deemed the altercation a fight. Therefore, by rule, they're both ejected,"" said Mark Ayotte, the officials' crew chief. ""I just saw them each lock arms. And that escalated to the fight."" Embiid shadowboxed to the crowd's delight on his way back to the locker room. Fans responded with ""MVP!"" chants. ""I was built for this city,"" Embiid said. ""The love they have for me, I can't thank them enough. I appreciate all the love. That reaction was probably the loudest I ever heard them. That's what the city of Philadelphia is all about. You gotta come in here, you gotta fight, you gotta play hard, you gotta be gritty, you gotta be a Broad Street Bully. We're gonna keep on fighting and try to accomplish the goal we have set for us."" Towns downplayed the fight. ""It's a competitive game. As a team, we need to play better with our system. We didn't execute our game plan,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed in the (loss). I don't think we played our game. We were playing a different type of basketball. It wasn't what got us to 3-0. We can learn a lot from this game."" Embiid said the fight ""happened out of nowhere,"" but added: ""I like to get in people's mind."" Sixers coach Brett Brown said he's not concerned that Embiid will receive a suspension. ""I don't see punches being thrown (by Embiid) and I don't believe he was the instigator,"" Brown said. Both teams entered 3-0. The Spurs, at 3-0, are the only other unbeaten team in the NBA. Andrew Wiggins scored 19 points, Towns had 13 points and former Sixer Robert Covington had seven for the Timberwolves. Tobias Harris scored 18 points, Furkan Korkmaz had 17 off the bench and Simmons added 16 for Philadelphia. Al Horford grabbed 16 rebounds to go with 12 points. Minnesota led 11-9 midway through the first quarter before Harris hit a 3-pointer. Harris followed with a driving layup and Philadelphia led the rest of the way. Embiid punctuated a dominant first half with a 3 to put the Sixers up 63-42 going into the break. ""It's competitive, we knew it was going to be that way,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. BACK TO AI The Sixers haven't been 4-0 since Allen Iverson led them to the NBA Finals in the 2001-02 season. SIGHTINGS New Phillies manager Joe Girardi sat courtside in the first half. ... Eagles rookie running back Miles Sanders rang the bell and teammates Carson Wentz, Alshon Jeffery and several other players watched from a suite.

"BOSTON --  The Bucks exploited gaps in the Celtics' defense on their way to beating Boston in five games last season in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Celtics used a balanced, barrage of offense to return the favor in their first matchup this season. Kemba Walker had 21 of his 32 points in the second half and Boston rallied to beat Milwaukee 116-105 on Wednesday night. Jayson Tatum added 25 points, Gordon Hayward had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Marcus Smart finished with 19 points and six assists. Boston shot 54% from the field over the final two quarters. ""We've got so many talented guys on this team everybody should be chipping in to be the team we want to be,"" Tatum said. Milwaukee dominated in the first half, leading by 19 at one point. But the Celtics responded in the third quarter, using a 26-7 run over the final 6:38 of the period to take an 80-76 edge into the fourth. ""They got going pretty good,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Kemba's a great player, but they played through Hayward a little bit. Tatum made some big shots, tough shots. They mixed and matched well -- those three tonight."" Boston kept that momentum, beginning the final period with an 11-4 run to open a 91-80 lead. ""I think it started on the defensive end,"" Hayward said. ""We kept getting stops, our energy picked up and that kind of turned it around for us in the second half."" Khris Middleton led the Bucks with 26 points. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points and 14 rebounds, but the reigning MVP lost his composure late, first picking up a hard foul on Smart and then a technical foul in the final minute. Antetokounmpo said there was no malicious intent on the play with Smart. ""Nothing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I tried to go for the rebound. He tried to go for the rebound. Two guys that play hard and we both ended up on the floor."" The Celtics started Daniel Theis at center and the defensive-minded Smart at guard with Jaylen Brown out with an illness and Enes Kanter sidelined for the third straight game with a bruised left knee. It did little to stop the much bigger Bucks front line from getting in the paint early on as Milwaukee sliced through Boston's interior and hit nine 3-pointers on their way to a 58-42 halftime lead TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo had his third straight double-double. ... Milwaukee had a 37-8 edge in bench scoring. Celtics: Walker, Tatum and Hayward were a combined 7 of 26 from the field in the first half. AIR MAIL Antetokounmpo airballed a pair of free throws with 1:46 left in the second quarter, igniting a chorus of cheers from the home crowd. But Antetokounmpo, who entered the night shooting just 54 percent from the line, bounced back at the end of the half by connecting on all three of his free throw attempts after being fouled by Smart with one second to play. FIRST IMPRESSION One of the memories that still stands out for Celtics coach Brad Stevens about serving as Eastern Conference All-Star Game coach in 2017 is what Antetokounmpo -- then a first-time All-Star -- told him before the game. ""I remember him telling me, `I'm going to play hard,"" Stevens recalled. ""I'm like, `You might be one of a few.' But that's the deal, right? He just plays really hard."" Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, six rebounds, three steals and a block that night.","401160700"
"NEW YORK --  Domantas Sabonis and the Indiana Pacers finally got their first victory of the season. Sabonis scored 29 points, Jeremy Lamb added 25 and Indiana Pacers beat the Brooklyn Nets 118-108 on Wednesday night for their first victory in five games. ""(Sabonis) was a monster down there,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Just defending, rebounding, initiating offense. Had to play a lot of minutes, but was fired up and I thought we rode his energy."" Sabonis carried the frontcourt load when Myles Turner left the game after spraining his right ankle in the first quarter. ""It's tough,"" Sabonis said about losing Turner. ""Because it's the beginning of the season, we're also trying to find each other and find that chemistry and play together, and obviously he's going to be out for a little bit. It's tough. I wish him a speedy recovery. When he comes back he's going to help us, he's the best defender in the league."" Malcolm Brogdon added 21 points and 13 assists for Indiana. Kyrie Irving led Brooklyn with 28 points, Spencer Dinwiddie had 20 and Caris LeVert 15. The Nets have lost two in a row to fall to 1-3. ""We're not really running anything (on offense),"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""In training camp you're practicing a lot, but you have a nice flow, you kind of know what you're doing. I think we've lost a little bit of our structure and organization, which is natural with a new team and new guys."" The Pacers took their largest lead at 112-96 on Brogdan's 3-pointer with 4:43 remaining. Indiana took a 90-83 lead into the fourth quarter, with Sabonis and Lamb each scoring seven points in the third. With three new starters in Irving, DeAndre Jordan and Taurean Prince, the Nets have become more of an isolation team than the cohesive group from a season ago. ""Basketball has a way of being sequentially sound or it can be sequentially off completely,"" Irving said. ""Be able to weather the storm out there. Some possessions are not going to be perfect. We want to limit the mistakes out there where you have opportunities to attack the basket, shoot threes and get everyone confident. Wins and losses come and go. It just gives us a chance to dive into practice and really take it day by day. The details are really what separates the good and the bad teams in the league.""

""I feel comfortable,"" Siakam said. ""The more I get in situations like that, the more comfortable I get. Just having the coach trust me to have the ball in my hands, and my teammates also, it feels good."" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Siakam is becoming ""a prime-time scorer.""

Lillard had 23 points and 13 assists to help the Portland Trail Blazers hold off Oklahoma City 102-99 on Wednesday night. In last year's first-round playoff matchup between the teams, Lillard's deep 3-pointer over Paul George won Game 5 and the series.

Lillard rested to start the final period and mapped out his strategy. ""The whole time I was sitting on the bench, I knew I was going to come in and try to keep it in my hands a little bit more and try to impose my will on the game a little bit more,"" he said. ""And it worked out."" The Trail Blazers led the rest of the way. The Thunder have been competitive in their losses, but they haven't had a scorer like Lillard step up at critical moments to get them over the top. ""I was telling the guys postgame that's why guys get paid the big bucks -- to make big shots like that in the fourth quarter,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""Dame got it going."" C.J. McCollum scored 22 points and Kent Bazemore added 14 for the Trail Blazers. Paul scored 21 points, Dennis Schroder scored 17 and Nerlens Noel added 15 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder. Portland led 49-44 at halftime. The Trail Blazers shot 38.1% in the first half while the Thunder shot 35%. Lillard made just 2 of 8 shots in the first half and scored seven points. A 3-pointer by Paul tied the game at 53 early in the third quarter, and then he made a jumper to put the Thunder ahead by two. The Thunder took a 69-68 lead into the final period. Diallo grabbed three offensive rebounds on one possession before finally scoring to put the Thunder up 79-76, and Mike Muscala's layup on an assist from Paul put the Thunder up by five before the Trail Blazers rallied. ""It was an ugly game,"" Lillard said. ""Both teams turned it over, missing shots, a lot of bad possessions, low-scoring. So you knew it was going to come to the last five, six minutes."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Held the Thunder to 27.8% shooting in the first quarter to take a 24-17 lead. ... C Hassan Whiteside left the game late in the second quarter after injuring his left knee. He later returned. He finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds. ... McCollum made just 7 of 22 shots. Thunder: C Steven Adams sat out with a left knee contusion. Coach Billy Donovan said Adams will be re-evaluated on Thursday. ... Muscala made 2 of 9 shots and scored four points. ... G Hamidou Diallo had a career-high 10 rebounds to go with 12 points. STAT LINES The Thunder made just 4 of 27 3-point attempts and shot 39.3% overall. Danilo Gallinari made 3 of 9 3s, and the rest of the team made 1 of 18. ""We're getting great shots,"" Paul said. ""That's the thing. Sharing the ball isn't a problem for us. If that was a problem, I'd be worried. Shots are going to start falling, so we've just got to keep playing the way we're playing."" QUOTABLE Lillard on his late assist to Rodney Hood for a 3-pointer: ""Sometimes, we're going to be able to have success when I'm making shots, taking over, when I'm the one scoring the ball. But I think it'll go further and it will be stronger and we'll be able to do it more often when we trust in each other making that extra pass and guys are in that situation where they get an opportunity to take and make a big shot.""","401160704"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Utah Jazz had to kick Mike Conley out of the gym Wednesday morning. Conley kept shooting until the coaching staff pleaded for him to ""save something for the game."" Turns out, he had plenty left. Conley snapped an early season slump with 29 points and the Jazz beat the Los Angeles Clippers 110-96 on Wednesday night with Kawhi Leonard sitting out. ""I just wanted to get back to who I am,"" Conley said. ""I hit one, hit two and could feel going. I felt the energy from the crowd and my teammates and said, yes, this is the game."" Conley had 18 points in the third quarter as the Jazz scored 40 in the period and took a 90-71 lead. Utah (4-1) has won three in a row. Leonard missed the game for scheduled rest, though coach Doc Rivers has said his star forward has been healthy and energized. The Clippers play the second half of a back-to-back Thursday against San Antonio in Los Angeles. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points, Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 and Rudy Gobert 13. But, collectively, the Jazz were determined to get Conley on track. ""Just trying to get Mike open,"" Gobert said. ""He did a great job reading the defense and making all the shots, driving the lane."" Lou Williams paced the Clippers (3-2) with 24 points, 16 before halftime. The matchup of one of the league's top defenses against one of the top offenses lost some its luster without Leonard, but the Jazz showed how potent they could be with 55 percent shooting while holding their opponents below 100 points for the fifth straight game. ""Our guys take pride on the defensive end,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We were better on the ball, in pursuit of the ball handlers and got some contests (in the third quarter)."" JaMychal Green, who had 23 points, led his fellow Clipper reserves in a fourth-quarter rally, cutting a 23-point edge to 99-89. Conley responded with a 3-pointer and a lob to Gobert for a dunk. ""Second half, they made some tough shots,"" Patrick Beverly said. ""They made the shots that we wanted them to take."" Conley struggled in his first four games with Utah after playing 12 years in Memphis, including a 1-for-16 shooting performance in the opener and an 0-for-7 outing in the last game. In recent days, he admitted it has taken more time than he expected to feel comfortable with the Jazz plays and terminology. ""As much as I tried not to, I was pressing. I have to say some doubt crept in. It was consuming,"" Conley said. When Conley hit a 3-pointer and followed it with a tough layup high off the backboard in third quarter, he pumped his fist and yelled to the rafters. When Los Angeles called timeout, the entire Jazz bench leaped off the bench and ran onto the court to greet the point guard. ""It's a big relief and I've really wanted to start playing like I'm used to. I hope this is the beginning of the positive Mike,"" Conley said. A few minutes later, Conley hit a high-arcing 3-pointer and motioned for the crowd to get louder. Cheers rang out and then turned into chants of ""Con-ley, Con-ley, Con-ley"". ""I've never experienced that before in 13 years of playing basketball. It was special and I could tell the crowd was feeling like I was, just waiting and had a lot of energy built up,"" Conley said. After just nine made field goals in his first four games, Conley made 11 of 17 shots, including five 3-pointers, and had five assists with a season-low two turnovers. ""Mike's a pretty calm guy but when he was screaming and yelling, once we saw that, we were feeding of it,"" Mitchell said. The Jazz were hot from the start and led by 14 points early in the second quarter. The Clippers trimmed the advantage to 52-51 at halftime. TIP INS Clippers: Williams, who has won the Sixth Man of the Year award a record three times, started the game. ""Lou has no problem starting or coming off the bench,"" Rivers said. ... LA had 20 turnovers. ... Rivers lamented not having Leonard and Paul George, who continues his rehabilitation: ""Having guys back at home. That's a lot of points sitting out of the game for us."" ... Rookie Terrance Mann scored the first points of his career and finished with four points and five assists. Jazz: Dante Exum is still inactive as he recovers from knee surgery. ... Utah had a season-high 13 steals. ... Gobert had two blocks and reached 900 rejections in his career.","401160705"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  P.J. Washington controlled the post well enough to keep Charlotte close until the rest of his teammates found their rhythm. The Hornets rookie showed some versatility, too, when he stepped out and made a pair of shots beyond the arc. Washington scored 23 points to lead seven Charlotte players in double figures and the Hornets rallied from 14 down to beat the winless Sacramento Kings 118-111 on Wednesday night. ""I thought he imposed his will on that game immediately when he stepped on the floor,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""Right now we have a young man that has that potential to go down in the post and play out in the perimeter. That's a very complete young man."" The 12th overall pick in the draft, Washington has been everything the Hornets hoped for, particularly playing center when Borrego goes with his small lineup. Washington's perimeter shooting has provided an equally big boost. He had two 3s against the Kings and is shooting 13 of 25 beyond the arc through five games. ""I'm shooting it with confidence,"" Washington said. ""If I have an open look I'm definitely taking it. If you don't have a hand up I'm shooting it."" Terry Rozier had 22 points, six assists and five rebounds for Charlotte, which hadn't won since beating Chicago in the season-opener. The Hornets set a franchise-record with 23 3-pointers against the Bulls and had another big night beyond the arc against Sacramento, going 16 of 32. Cody Zeller added 12 points and 15 rebounds for Charlotte (2-3) while Malik Monk scored 18. Buddy Hield scored 23 points and Harrison Barnes had 22 for the Kings. Sacramento (0-5) is off to its worst start since 1990-91 when the Kings lost their first seven on the way to a 25-57 record. ""We have to punch back,"" said Sacramento's Richaun Holmes, who started at center as part of coach Luke Walton's attempt to shake the Kings out of their funk. ""Teams are going to make runs and we haven't responded, especially in the third quarter. We get punched. We have to be ready to respond."" The Hornets trailed 49-35 midway through the second quarter but closed within 66-61 at halftime, then took control in the third quarter. Rozier, Monk and Miles Bridges each made two 3-pointers, and Devonte Graham added a pair of free throws that made it 93-84. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum (broken middle finger) missed his third straight game after being hurt in the opener. Batum, who is expected to miss 3-4 weeks, has been able to practice while wearing a protective splint. Kings: De'Aaron Fox had 16 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. ... Sacramento's 14-point lead in the second quarter was its biggest of the season. The Kings had not led by more than 11 in its first four games. ... Marvin Bagley III (right thumb fracture) and Harry Giles (left knee soreness) did not play. HOLMES EARNS START Holmes has been Sacramento's most active player this season, which led coach Luke Walton to start him for the first time this season in place of 7-foot center Dewayne Dedmon. It paid off, as Holmes scored 11 of his 17 points in the first half. Holmes also had seven rebounds. GOING DEEP The Hornets made eight 3-pointers in the third quarter -- one more than they had in the first half. WILD THING Charlotte guard Dwayne Bacon attempted a cross-court pass that sailed three rows into the stands in the third quarter.","401160706"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  In what has already been a rough start to the season for the Warriors, now Stephen Curry is down. A two-time MVP, Golden State's longest-tenured player and its oldest at age 31. The heart and soul of his team. Curry broke his left hand and became the latest injured Warriors player when he fell hard in the third quarter of another embarrassing defeat by Golden State, 121-110 to the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. A CT scan will determine whether Curry needs surgery, the Warriors said. ""I just feel bad for him,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""When these guys who are the faces of the league go down it's not good for the league, but especially someone like Steph, who's done so much to raise the level of excitement here in the Bay Area and throughout the league."" Curry drove to his left defended by Kelly Oubre Jr. and with big man Aron Baynes standing solidly in the paint. Curry leapt with the ball then came down head first landing awkwardly on his hands to brace himself from the court, with Baynes crashing onto Curry's left hand. Curry grimaced in pain grabbing at his fingers then walked to the locker room with 8:31 left in the third quarter. ""Aron Baynes came up after the game and just wanted to know how Steph was doing,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""You could tell he felt really bad. It's just a random basketball play, so stuff happens."" Baynes had 24 points, 12 rebounds seven assists and three blocked shots, Devin Booker scored 31 points as the Suns jumped out to a huge lead they never relinquished. The Warriors have lost badly in their first two home games at sparkling new Chase Center. The ailing, undermanned Warriors welcomed back two players but still fell behind 39-11 shooting 4 for 17 as the Suns made 14 of their first 23 shots and 8 of 12 3-pointers. Curry had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting before getting hurt. Losing Curry for an extended period would be a huge blow for a young Warriors team. ""Of course it hurts knowing that Steph Curry's down,"" said rookie Eric Paschall, who made his first career start and scored a team-high 20 points. ""... That's a very, very valuable piece of our team but I feel like we're going to stay positive."" Golden State is struggling to start the season with Kevin Durant's departure to Brooklyn and Klay Thompson out for perhaps the entire season recovering from July 2 surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee. This was another rough one after an embarrassing season opener in the first game at Chase Center, a 141-122 loss to the Clippers last Thursday that saw some fans leaving after the third quarter. Golden State returned home with a 1-2 record and amid a stretch with five games over seven days and two back-to-backs. The Warriors trailed 72-46 at halftime Wednesday after falling behind 70-37 at the break in Oklahoma City on Sunday. Golden State center Willie Cauley-Stein, who missed all of training camp with a sprain in his left foot, had 12 points and five rebounds in his Golden State debut. He checked in for the first time at the 8:23 mark of the first quarter. LGBTQ NIGHT The Warriors held LGBTQ Night with a panel following the game featuring Golden State COO Rick Welts -- the first openly gay NBA executive -- WNBA and Olympic champion Sue Bird of the Seattle Storm and her partner, Megan Rapinoe, of the World Cup-winning U.S. women's soccer team. Kerr tried to connect with Rapinoe over the summer to have her speak to the World Cup basketball team he coached that went to China. It didn't work out but he hoped to get a few minutes with her Wednesday. ""She's such an incredible athlete and advocate and Sue has been one of the best women's players in the game for a long time,"" Kerr said. ""I know Rick is close with both of them so it's important I think, especially on a night like tonight where we're celebrating the idea of being accepting of everyone, it's great to have them here."" The women also spoke to members of the Warriors organization earlier in the day. Bird and the U.S. women's basketball team play at Stanford on Saturday. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix beat Golden State for just the third time in the last 21 regular-season meetings. ... The Suns' 115-111 win at Golden State on March 10 this year snapped an 18-game losing streak to the Warriors and a 14-game road skid in the series. ... Suns assistant coach Willie Green spent the past three years with the Warriors. Warriors: Kerr said F Kevon Looney, who missed his fourth straight game because of a right hamstring injury, is scheduled to be evaluated early next week by a team of specialists because of an ""on-going presence of a neuropathic condition in his body, which has a direct correlation to his recent injury."" Looney is limited to controlled workouts with the training staff for now. ""He's frustrated and we're frustrated for him,"" Kerr said. ... Alec Burks, who missed all five preseason games and the first three of the regular season, also returned for the Warriors and scored seven points in his first game with Golden State. ...

"ATLANTA --  Kendrick Nunn is enjoying the best start of any undrafted player in NBA history. The rookie is taking the Miami Heat along for the ride. Nunn scored a career-high 28 points to add to his record-setting start and Miami beat Atlanta 106-97 on Thursday night, giving the Heat two wins over the Hawks in three days. Nunn's 112 points are the highest total through the first five games for any undrafted player in NBA history. Connie Hawkins of the Phoenix Suns scored 105 points in his first five games of the 1969-70 season. ""It's surreal a little bit,"" Nunn said. ""... All I needed was the opportunity."" Nunn, a 6-foot-2 guard from Oakland University in Michigan, scored 14 points in the third quarter. He began his career with 24 points against Memphis on Oct. 23, and he has kept shooting. He has scored at least 24 points three times in Miami's first five games. ""He can shoot it,"" Hawks rookie Cam Reddish said. ""I have a lot of respect for that guy."" Another record-setting rookie, Tyler Herro, had 17 points. Herro scored 29 points off the bench in the Heat's 112-97 win over Atlanta on Tuesday night to set a franchise record for a rookie reserve. The rookies have helped Miami (4-1) enjoy a strong start. Nunn and Herro are feeding off Jimmy Butler, who had 11 assists while scoring only five points. He added nine rebounds, six steals and blocked three shots. The Heat had 29 assists with only 13 turnovers. ""To tell you the truth, that was winning basketball today,"" Butler said. Nunn was impressed by Butler's play, especially the assists. ""That's huge, for your star player to be unselfish like that,"" Nunn said. Butler had 21 points in his Heat debut on Tuesday night, but said he doesn't have to score big to do his job. ""I'm not here to score 50 points or whatever. ... If we win, I'm good."" Reddish filled in at point guard for Trae Young, who was held out with a sprained right ankle. Jabari Parker led Atlanta with 23 points. DeAndre Bembry had 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Miami held a lead of 18 points, but Atlanta made a late comeback attempt. Bembry's steal and basket cut Miami's lead to 94-88 midway through the final period. Following a timeout, Meyers Leonard sank two 3-pointers for Miami, followed by a Nunn layup, for a 102-88 lead. Leonard had 16 points. Reddish had nine points with four assists and only one turnover. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said Reddish had a good start before crossing the ""fine line between playing with good pace and playing too fast."" Reddish, who joined De'Andre Hunter as rookie starters, said ""I feel like I learned a lot tonight, especially at that position. I've got to slow down and let the game come to me."" TIP-INS Heat: F Justise Winslow (lower back stiffness) did not play. ... The Heat took the lead with a string of 3-pointers late in the opening period, including Bam Adebayo's fourth career 3 and first of the season. ... Coach Erik Spoelstra made a successful challenge of a charge call against Adebayo in the second period. ... Miami made 14 of 37 3s, including four of six by Nunn. Hawks: Young, who suffered the injury on Tuesday night, did not appear to be limping when seen walking before the game. ...

"NEW ORLEANS --  The New Orleans Pelicans' matchup against Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets looked troublesome on paper, yet a stunning performance by Jahlil Okafor lifted the Pelicans to their first win of the young season. Okafor scored 26 points, Brandon Ingram added 25 and the Pelicans beat the Nuggets 122-107 on Thursday night as New Orleans claimed it first victory in five games. The Pelicans' defensive performance -- particularly against Jokic, the reigning first-team All-NBA center -- helped them end their early-season struggles in which they allowed at least 123 points in each of the first four games. ""More so than anything, I thought we were locked in defensively,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I thought we did a really good job, especially on Jokic."" Jokic finished with 13 points, six assists and six rebounds for a Nuggets team that has now lost two straight after a 3-0 start. ""I thought our starting group struggled; I thought they were low energy,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""We were lucky to be down by four at halftime, and they come out and punch us in the mouth to start that third quarter. I thought tonight was a disappointing, embarrassing effort."" Okafor scored 20 points in the second half, and the fifth-year center went to the free-throw line a career-high 13 times, making 10. Ingram has scored at least 22 points in each of his first five games for New Orleans after coming over from the Los Angeles Lakers. The Pelicans led the final three quarters. They made four of their first five shots in the third quarter to take a 10-point lead, and Denver struggled to recover. New Orleans' best defensive performance of the season came after a listless wire-to-wire loss to the Golden State Warriors on Monday. ""We got killed the other day in film after that bad performance against Golden State, but it was necessary,"" Okafor said. ""It was much needed, and we were able to fix the things that we talked about."" Jrue Holiday added 19 points and seven assists after missing the previous two games because of a sprained left knee sprain. Frank Jackson had 21 points on 8-of-10 shooting, and Gentry said Jackson's improvement is a related to his offseason workouts with Holiday. ""He seems to get better the more time he spends around Jrue,"" Gentry said. Michael Porter Jr. led the Nuggets with 15 points in his NBA debut. Jamal Murray and Jerami Grant each had 14 points. New Orleans benefited from improved shot selection. The Pelicans attempted at least 41 3-pointers in each of their first four games, but they reduced that to 33 on Thursday and made a season-high 46%. New Orleans shot 53% overall from the field. The Nuggets made just 7 of 26 3-pointers. The divide in long-range shooting was crucial, but Okafor's aggressiveness helped the Pelicans win the battle down low, too. ""I think that tonight kind of showed people that he can go against anybody, and he can handle himself,"" Holiday said of Okafor. TIP-INS Pelicans: Jackson scored 13 consecutive points during the first half. ... Lonzo Ball scored nine points and had eight assists. ... Derrick Favors (right knee soreness) missed his second straight game. ... Nicolo Melli, a 28-year-old Italian rookie, made his first career start, replacing guard J.J. Redick. Melli had seven points and four rebounds. ... Veteran guard E'Twaun Moore did not play for a fourth straight game despite being healthy. Nuggets: Porter, the 14th overall pick in 2018, missed last season after undergoing back surgery and did not appear in the first four games this season. ... Paul Millsap and Mason Plumlee each scored 10 points. ... Will Barton (left toe soreness) did not play. Torrey Craig started in his place. MAD MALONE Malone bemoaned the Nuggets' ""embarrassing effort"" multiple times after the game, noting that New Orleans outscored Denver 37-20 on fastbreak points. ""You can give all the transition defense rules that you want. To me, transition defense boils down to one thing -- effort,"" Malone said. ""Get back. You can tell them. You can lead a horse to water -- whatever analogy you want to use. We did not get back."" STARTER STRUGGLES Denver's starters scored just 48 points while the bench contributed the other 59. ""I thought guys off the bench played hard, gave effort,"" Malone said. ""We gotta find ways to get our starters to play the same way because they're not playing like that right now, they're just not.""","401160709"
"LOS ANGELES --  Gregg Popovich and Kawhi Leonard exchanged some laughs and pleasantries after Leonard's new team, the Los Angeles Clippers, defeated his former coach and the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night. If Leonard has any more nights like that against his former club, the normally irascible Popovich won't be smiling again. Leonard scored 38 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the Clippers' 103-97 victory, which handed the Spurs their first loss. It is Leonard's first points-rebounds, double-double this season. It is also his first double-double in three meetings against San Antonio, where he played seven seasons (2011-18) before being traded to Toronto in July of 2018. The 38 points ties for the fifth-most Leonard has scored in a regular-season game in his eight-year career. He took a career high 32 shots. ""It was something I look forward to,"" Leonard said about facing the Spurs. ""Just to be able to play against a great coach and my old teammates is always fun."" Leonard is 2-1 against his former team. While his departure from San Antonio wasn't amicable, Leonard said his relationship with Popovich is good, for the most part. Popovich didn't have much to say about Leonard postgame other than: ""I thought he was great."" When someone tried to get Popovich to expound, he replied: ""Doc's coaching him, I'm not. I just said he had a great game, there's nothing else to say."" Another thing going well is Leonard's start with the Clippers, the team he signed with as a free agent during the offseason. He has scored 30 or more in three of his first five games and is the first Clipper since Blake Griffin in 2015 to have at least 38 points and 12 rebounds in a game. ""Tonight was a great night for him to do his thing. We just followed his lead,"" Clippers guard Lou Williams said. Leonard -- who sat out Wednesday's game at Utah due to load management -- took control of the game in the second half, when he had 25 points on 10 of 16 shooting from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers. Los Angeles went on a 9-1 run to take a 64-55 lead with 6:55 remaining in the third quarter. Leonard scored five of his 10 third-quarter points during the rally, including a dunk after a steal of DeMar DeRozan at midcourt. San Antonio got within five (80-75) at the end of the third quarter before the Clippers scored 11 of the first 13 points in the fourth quarter with nine coming from Leonard. The Spurs scored six straight points to get within 97-93 with 2:34 left but could not get closer. The Clippers shot just 42.9% from the field, but Rivers was pleased with his team's defense. LaMarcus Aldridge came in averaging 21.3 points, but was held to five. ""It was a gritty game by both teams where no one could make a shot,"" Rivers said. ""Tonight was not a great offensive night but we were able to win it on defense."" DeRozan, a Los Angeles native, led San Antonio with 29 points and Derrick White added 20. TIP-INS Spurs: Popovich was not amused with the play of second-year guard Lonnie Walker, who was scoreless in five minutes.  Popovich said: ""I expect better effort, better awareness and a better attempt to take advantage of the minutes he gets. I thought he was non-competitive. You guys will have fun writing that."" ... G Dejounte Murray will not play Friday night against Golden State as a precaution. He had knee surgery after tearing his right ACL during the preseason last year. Clippers: This is the sixth straight year Los Angeles has started 4-2 or better. ... The Clippers are 3-0 at home for the first time in four years. ... G Lou Williams scored 12 points but was an uncharacteristic 5 of 19 from the field. ... Rivers, who is two wins shy of 900 as a coach, improved to 7-0 on Halloween and 5-0 with Los Angeles.","401160710"
"NEW YORK --  Even though James Harden's jumpers weren't falling, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson wanted to make sure his players kept defending them. So he held up a sign with a picture of former Orlando Magic player Dennis Scott, wearing his No. 3 uniform, with a red line crossing through it. The message came through loud and clear. ""It was a ridiculous sign,"" center Jarrett Allen said, ""but it made us look and it worked."" Taurean Prince had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and the Nets slowed down Harden and the Houston Rockets in a 123-116 victory Friday night. Two nights after scoring a franchise-record 159 points in a victory at Washington, the Rockets couldn't get nearly enough shots to drop after opening an early 15-point lead. They went 12 for 48 from 3-point range, with Harden a dismal 2 for 16 in the face of an improved Nets defense -- and Atkinson's unusual sign. ""It's just a defensive coverage we have and we've had trouble communicating it to the guys in the past, so we came up with this idea to find a way to communicate so everyone knows,"" Atkinson said. ""Sometimes if you use humor in things it sinks in a little more with the guys."" Harden, the NBA's leading scorer last season, fell to 14 for 70 from behind the arc this season. ""I had a lot of opportunities,"" Harden said. ""The 3-ball hasn't been going for me but I'm just going to continue to shoot. I was here yesterday, this morning was here shooting so I'm not worried about it. Those are good shots. Those are shots that I've been taking the last couple of years, so even if teams are trying to take the 3-ball away, I'm going to still shoot them."" Harden finished with 36 points and eight assists, but he was 10 for 31 from the field. Russell Westbrook added 27 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. The Nets also forced sixth man Eric Gordon to miss all five 3s in his 0-for-7 night. Westbrook was 1 for 6. ""Wide open,"" Westbrook said. ""Just got to make them."" Neither Harden nor Kyrie Irving was at his best in a matchup of the NBA's two leading scorers. Harden came in leading the league with 36.8 points per game, and scored 59 in the Washington outburst. Irving was at 35.3 per game and had scored at least 26 in all four games, but he finished with 22 points on 7-for-18 shooting with 10 assists. The Nets didn't need a big scoring performance from him in a well-balanced effort. Caris LeVert scored 25 points, Garrett Temple had 16 and Joe Harris 15. Houston led 45-30 early in the second quarter, but LeVert scored 12 points in the period to send the Nets into halftime with a 61-59 lead. Prince hit two 3-pointers during his run of eight straight points for Brooklyn that extended the lead to 85-73, and the Nets were still up 12 after three. Westbrook had three baskets early in the fourth as Houston climbed within eight, but then he checked out for a few minutes when Harden came back on, and the Rockets' push fizzled. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston had won three in a row. ... Houston has scored 30 or more in the first quarter three times in five games. Nets: Brooklyn committed 10 turnovers in the first quarter. ... Temple scored in double figures for the first time this season. He went 4 for 6 from 3-point range after going 2 for 9 in the first four games. FIRST-QUARTER FLURRY Harden lost three points in the first quarter when a review of his 3-pointer showed he stepped out of bounds first. The Nets went from a 23-18 lead going into a timeout to 23-15 coming out of it. The Rockets then ran off the next 13 points and outscored Brooklyn 18-1 the rest of the period to lead 33-24. UNSTOPPABLE SCORER? Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni was asked what Westbrook's presence prevents teams from doing against Harden that they could do before. ""To be honest with you, it wouldn't matter if he's out there, I'm out there. You could play with him,"" D'Antoni responded. ""He's getting 60 if he wants. They can try anything they want to.""","401160711"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Malcolm Brogdon is putting up some big numbers for the Indiana Pacers. The newcomer filled the box score again Friday night with 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists to push the injury-riddled Pacers to their first home win of the season, 102-95 over the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""I love it. This is a basketball city, a basketball state,"" Brogdon said. ""People show me a lot of love. I'm going to enjoy playing here."" Especially as victories come. With their defense tightening and the bench finally finding its stride Friday, the Pacers have won two straight games after starting 0-3. In avenging a 110-99 loss in Cleveland last weekend, Indiana held the Cavaliers to 37% shooting and forced 16 turnovers in an uncharacteristically low-scoring game. Jeremy Lamb totaled 21 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana, and Domantas Sabonis added 18 points and 17 rebounds, but it was the second unit that broke open a close game in the fourth quarter. Reserves accounted for 10 points in a 12-3 run that provided the Pacers an 82-71 advantage, the largest for either side all night. T.J. McConnell, who finished with five points and six assists, faked Collin Sexton into a foul in the lane and completed a three-point play. Rookie center Goga Bitazde, who finished with 10 points and nine boards and blocked four shots, drained his first 3-pointer during the sequence. ""They told me I've got to be ready any time,"" Bitazde said. ""We're all for each other. We have good chemistry. We've just got to try to keep doing this."" Indiana outscored the Cavaliers by 15 points in the 25 minutes the 6-foot-11 first-round pick roamed the floor. Bitazde seized his opportunity as Indiana played without the injured All-Star guard Victor Oladipo and starting center Myles Turner. ""Goga made huge plays,"" Lamb said. Brogdon drained four clutch free throws in the final minute to keep the Cavaliers at bay. Jordan Clarkson, who finished with 20 points and five assists, missed a 3 from the left side that would have brought Cleveland within three points in the final minute. Brogdon was acquired in a July sign-and-trade deal with Milwaukee, where he played shooting guard and averaged 15.6 points and 4.5 rebounds. With his new team, at a new position, the fourth-year professional has upped his scoring to 22.6 points per game along with 10.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds. Sexton had 21 points for the Cavs, who led 26-19 after the first quarter but fell into a 42-37 hole at halftime. Indiana, which shot 41% for the game and missed 22 of 27 3-point tries, was ahead 68-61 entering the final period. ""I thought our bench did a good job in that first half as well as the second lifting us and getting us going."" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""You might have nights like that where your shot's not falling, and you're going to need your bench to help you."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Love had 22 points and 17 boards. ... The team announced that general manager Koby Altman signed a ""long-term"" contract extension. Coach John Beilein reacted by expressing his hope for ""a really strong partnership, that we've got each other's backs all the time."" Pacers: TJ Leaf started at power forward with Sabonis moving to center in place of Turner, who suffered a sprained right ankle Wednesday in a 118-108 win at Brooklyn. Leaf played eight minutes and did not score. ... Indiana outscored Cleveland in the paint 56-38. REMINISCING During shootaround, Beilein's mind wandered back to his days in college basketball when he coached Michigan in Big Ten tournament games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. ""It seemed like whenever we came into this building we were on the bubble,"" he said. ""We had to go in here and win one, two or three games to get in the NCAA tournament, so I've got fond memories. I love this town. Just the way it's laid out for fans and basketball, I love coming to Indy.""","401160712"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It was a pretty typical performance for Giannis Antetokounmpo. Donte DiVincenzo was a bit of a surprise. Antetokounmpo had 29 points and 14 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks pounded the Orlando Magic 123-91 on Friday night. While the reigning NBA MVP was great once again, DiVincenzo scored 14 points in his most extensive action so far this season. He played two minutes in the Bucks' first four games and had not taken a shot. DiVincenzo went 4 for 7 from 3-point range. He also contributed three assists and two steals in 17 minutes. ""He hasn't played all season, and one thing I told him was to stay ready,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""You're going to get your opportunity, and he was ready tonight."" Eric Bledsoe added 18 points, six rebounds and six assists for Milwaukee, which was coming off a 116-105 loss at Boston on Wednesday night. Khris Middleton added 16 points and six rebounds. The Bucks grabbed control by making nine 3-pointers during a key stretch in the first half. They went 17 for 47 from beyond the arc on the night. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 19 points. Nikola Vucevic had 14 points and seven rebounds. Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, Bledsoe, Ersan Ilyasova (two), Sterling Brown, George Hill and DiVincenzo (two) connected from long range during a 32-7 run for the Bucks. ""You could feel things shifting in that first quarter,"" DiVincenzo said. ""Everybody on our team is so unselfish. We have guys who could get 25 every night, but instead we have a balanced attack and guys getting open looks."" After making eight of their first nine shots on their way to a 20-7 lead, the Magic were outscored 40-9 over the next 11 minutes, most of it by Milwaukee's reserves. ""Orlando was doing a lot of things well early, but our bench came in and flipped the script,"" said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""We had really good bench play tonight."" The Bucks led 79-51 after Middleton scored seven straight points midway through the third quarter. Milwaukee shot 50.5 percent for the game. The Bucks also had a 57-41 rebound advantage and scored 54 points in the paint. ""They were wide open, wide open ... wide open. It wasn't like they made all these great shots, it was wide open,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""It was an unacceptable effort against a great team and they played well."" TIP-INS Bucks: Seventeen of the Bucks' first 21 shots were 3-pointers. ... G Pat Connaughton left the floor with a shoulder injury in the third quarter, but returned to the game. ... Kyle Korver rested. Budenholzer said the Bucks would look for periodic games off for the 38-year-old guard. Magic: F Amile Jefferson, who had been on a two-way contract with Orlando, signed a standard contract Friday. ... C Mo Bamba (load management) and G Michael Carter-Williams (bruised hip) were out. NO MAGIC TOUCH The Magic came into the game last in the NBA in scoring (95.8 points per game) and shooting (.395) and second-last in 3-point shooting (.288). They didn't do anything to help themselves, shooting 37.4 percent and scoring under 100 points for the fifth straight time.","401160713"
"BOSTON --  Jayson Tatum made a big play at a big moment for the Boston Celtics. Then he made it sound very routine. Tatum hit a turnaround jumper with 1.3 seconds remaining, and the Celtics beat the New York Knicks 104-102 on Friday night for their fourth straight victory. ""It feels great, but I don't want to get too excited,"" Tatum said. ""The guys that I look up to in this league, they've do things like this all the time."" Tatum finished with 24 points. Kemba Walker scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half, and Gordon Hayward had 13 points and nine boards. Walker called Tatum's basket ""a huge, big-time shot."" ""I'm happy we went to him,"" he said. ""Hopefully that keeps him confident. That can really just get something going for us. That was an unbelievable play."" Unlike a 118-95 rout at Madison Square Garden the previous Saturday, Boston was pushed by New York until the very end of a game that featured 24 lead changes and 10 ties. Marcus Morris, who played the last two seasons with the Celtics before signing with New York as a free agent, led the Knicks with 29 points. Morris made four foul shots in the final minute, and then hit a tying 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left. ""We stayed locked in all game long,"" said Knicks rookie RJ Barrett, who finished with 15 points and seven rebounds. ""The whole fourth quarter we was fighting, and that's the identity of our team. We did that tonight."" After Morris' late 3, the Celtics called timeout and Marcus Smart inbounded the ball to Tatum in the corner. He caught the pass, turned around and pulled up for a shot from the corner that was initially called a 3-pointer. It was quickly overturned during the timeout, but it didn't matter. The Celtics broke up a long inbound pass and the Knicks didn't get off another shot. Morris congratulated his former teammate after the game. ""It was good to see him get his first one (game-winning shot),"" Morris said. ""I wish it could have been against somebody else, but hey -- it's the NBA."" WELCOME WALKER It was the third straight game with 30-plus points by Walker, who scored 32 in the previous two and finished with his best game since signing with the Celtics as a free agent. Walker also hit all 14 of his foul shots and added five assists and six rebounds. ""We stuck with the game,"" Walker said. ""It came down to a last-second shot, but (we'll) take wins any way you can get them."" LONG BALL The Knicks led 50-49 at halftime and opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Frank Ntilikina, starting a period full of shots from beyond the arc. Both clubs hit five 3-pointers in the quarter before the Celtics carried a 75-74 lead into the fourth. The back-and-forth continued in the final period. Boston regained the lead on a three-point play by Walker, putting the Celtics up 87-86 with 5:19 remaining. Hayward followed with a 3-pointer and Tatum hit a pair of foul shots to stretch the lead to 92-86 with 4:14 left to play. The Knicks pulled within a point at 92-91, then again at 95-94 on a 3-pointer by Morris, but the Celtics answered with a pair of free throws by Walker and a 3-pointer by Tatum with 1:50 remaining, giving Boston a 99-94 lead. TIP-INS Knicks: Bobby Portis had 13 points and seven rebounds. ... Ntilikina scored 10. He started at point guard, where the Knicks were without Elfrid Payton (hamstring), Dennis Smith Jr. (death in the family) and Kadeem Allen (knee). Celtics: Rookie Grant Williams scored 10 points.","401160714"
"CHICAGO --  Trailing by one in the closing minutes, the Chicago Bulls were looking for someone to hit the big shots. Zach LaVine delivered the baskets they needed. LaVine scored 26 points, Otto Porter Jr. added 22, and the Bulls overcame a big effort by Derrick Rose against his former team to beat the Detroit Pistons 112-106 on Friday night. Rose delighted the hometown crowd with 23 points and seven assists. But the Bulls came away with the win after dropping three in a row while handing the Pistons their fourth loss in five games. LaVine put Chicago ahead for good with back-to-back 3-pointers and added four free throws in the final 11.5 seconds. ""Somebody's got to step up to the plate,"" he said. ""I think I'm that dude."" Porter did his part, shooting 8 of 12 and nailing three 3's. Wendell Carter Jr. added 16 points and 11 rebounds, and the Bulls snapped a seven-game losing streak against the Pistons. ROSE'S RETURN Rose got a loud ovation when he entered the game in the first quarter and heard those familiar ""MVP! MVP!"" chants from the Chicago crowd throughout the night. The South Side product flashed some of the old explosiveness that made him the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2008 and NBA's youngest MVP three years later, before injuries derailed his promising career with the Bulls. ""I felt the love out there,"" Rose said. ""I wish we would have gotten the win, but coming here is always special and playing here is always special."" Andre Drummond led Detroit with 25 points and 24 rebounds -- his third 20-20 game this season. Luke Kennard scored 15 and made three 3-pointers. But the Pistons missed their first 14 from beyond the arc before he hit one late in the first half and were 6 of 29 in the game. PULLING AWAY Chicago, which led by as much as 16, trailed 100-99 after a layup by Tony Snell. But LaVine responded by hitting back-to-back 3's to put the Bulls back on top 105-100 with three minutes left. Chicago was clinging to a 107-104 lead with just over a minute remaining when Tomas Satoransky got called for traveling. But Rose missed a runner. After LaVine missed a layup, Snell missed a 3 for Detroit. Carter then made 1 of 2 free throws with 17.5 seconds remaining to make it 108-104. Kennard then missed a 3, and LaVine hit two free throws, bumping the lead to six with 11.5 seconds left. QUOTABLE ""He is as tough a cover in the league as there is right now, with his ability to split, his ability to burst, his ability to sneak and his ability to shoot the ball. I'm really happy for him."" -- Bulls coach Jim Boylen on Rose. TIP-INS Pistons: Despite the poor 3-point shooting, Detroit shot just over 48 percent overall. ... The Pistons still don't have a timetable for the return of star F Blake Griffin (left hamstring and posterior knee soreness), who has missed the first six games. ""Obviously, we're all hoping that it's sooner than later,"" said assistant Sidney Lowe, who handled pregame media duties with coach Dwane Casey a game-time decision because of an illness. ""He was out there on his own today doing some stuff."" ... Casey worked the game. Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen hurt his left side and missed the final 9:30 after being held out down the stretch two nights earlier at Cleveland. Markkanen could have returned to the game and does not expect the injury to linger. ... Boylen expects F Chandler Hutchison (strained left hamstring) to practice Saturday and travel with the team to Indiana for Sunday's game. He wasn't sure if the second-year pro will be ready to make his season debut against the Pacers.  ... Rose wasn't the only former Bulls player to get a big ovation. The crowd greeted former teammate Joakim Noah with a big one when he was shown on the videoboard in the second quarter.","401160715"
"DALLAS --  LeBron James faced the crowd and sidestepped his way up the floor after a punctuating 3-pointer in overtime made possible by Danny Green's buzzer-beating 3 in regulation. The Lakers star took an extra peek toward the national TV crew at center court, perhaps to gauge the entertainment value of the first matchup of the 15-time All-Star alongside Anthony Davis against Dallas' young European pair of Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis. The extra period was anticlimactic -- but didn't really take away from the second half that preceded it. Davis started overtime with back-to-back dunks after Green's corner 3, and the Lakers beat the Mavericks 119-110 on Friday night amid matching triple-doubles from James and Doncic, the Slovenian who grew up admiring the four-time MVP. ""You never know who you can inspire along your path,"" James said. ""For me, playing the game the right way, getting my teammates involved and playing for the purity of the game, I was able to inspire a kid that wasn't even in America. That's pretty special."" James had a season-high 39 points with 16 assists and 10 rebounds, while Doncic finished with 31 points, a career-high 15 assists and 13 boards. According to the NBA, they became the youngest and oldest players in NBA history with triple-doubles that included at least 30 points and 15 assists, doing so in the same game. The 20-year-old Doncic, who grew up modeling his game after James, had his 10th career triple-double, extending his record for the most for a player under 21. James, who has 82 for his career, is third on that list with five. James had nine points in overtime, starting with a three-point play that followed Davis' dunks for a second 10-0 run going back to regulation -- following one that immediately wiped out a 10-point halftime lead to start the third quarter. The last of Doncic's assists went to Dorian Finney-Smith for a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute of regulation. The Mavericks got a stop, but Dwight Powell missed one of two free throws to keep their lead at three, setting up Green's tying corner 3 on James' 14th assist. The Mavericks had a foul to give when James dribbled inside the 3-point line before finding Green. ""That's on me,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Our plan in that situation was to foul a guy on the catch in a non-shooting situation. But the fact that we were unable to do it is on me."" Davis had 31 points and eight rebounds. Kristaps Porzingis finished with 16 points and nine boards after a fast start for the 7-foot-3 Latvian that included a crossover dribble 3-pointer in front of Davis in the best test yet of opposing big-name duos for him and Doncic. Doncic had his triple-double before the end of the third quarter, helping the Mavericks restore all but one point of a 10-point halftime lead after the Lakers put together a 10-0 run coming out of halftime. ""You can't watch this game and say the NBA isn't one of the most enjoyable things to watch in the world,"" Carlisle said. ""We're not happy about losing. That's all."" The Mavericks expanded a nine-point lead to 11 in the first half despite being without Doncic and Porzingis for nearly a full quarter because of foul trouble. Part of the reason was the season debut of 7-foot-4 (formerly 7-3) Boban Marjanovic, who had four points and seven rebounds along with three fouls in 11 minutes. TIP-INS Lakers: James was 4 of 7 on 3s in the second half after missing his two attempts before halftime. ... Green finished with 14 points. Avery Bradley scored 11. ... At 4-1, the Lakers are off to their best start since going 8-0 to open the 2010-11 season. Mavericks: Had a repeat of the starting lineup for the first time this season, using the one from a 109-106 win in Denver. It was Doncic, Porzingis, Powell, Seth Curry and Finney-Smith. Doncic and Porzingis are the only players to start all five games. ... Powell scored 14 points, Delon Wright had 12 and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 11. ... Dallas had five players in double figures after tying a franchise record with nine against the Nuggets. DONCIC'S BUMP Doncic took a hard fall in the final minute of regulation when he collided with Finney-Smith while they chased a loose ball on a rebound. He was checking the back of his head for blood as play continued and was getting stitches after the game. KUZMA DEBUT Kyle Kuzma made his season debut for the Lakers with nine points and three rebounds in 19 minutes, about how much coach Frank Vogel said he would play after missing the preseason with a right ankle injury from his stint with USA Basketball during the summer.","401160716"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  De'Aaron Fox got back to attacking the rim. Buddy Hield and Bogdan Bogdanovic found their rhythm from the perimeter. And Luke Walton finally got his first victory with Sacramento. With one all-inclusive performance, the Kings ended their worst start in nearly 30 years and shook off the label of being the NBA's only remaining winless team. Harrison Barnes scored on an offensive rebound with 2.9 seconds remaining after Nemanja Bjelica's missed 3-pointer, and the Kings won their first game of the season, beating the Utah Jazz 102-101 on Friday night. ""It was probably the first time all season we put together a full game,"" Barnes said. ""Everyone down the line came in and contributed, and that was the team effort that we needed, the energy, the fight when they made runs, that we needed."" It wasn't all pretty. Sacramento committed 17 turnovers, made only 12 of 17 free throws and was outscored 13-5 over the final 5 minutes. But for a franchise that had playoff aspirations after going 39-43 a year ago, it was a definitive step forward. ""We were hungry tonight? Yes. Have we been hungry most games to start? Yes, and then it fades out,"" Walton said. ""But that's the intensity that we have to have for an entire game. Hopefully we feel that, we build on it and we continue to go in the right direction."" Fox scored 25 points, Hield had 18 and Bogdanovic added 14 to help the Kings (1-5). Donovan Mitchell had 24 points for the Jazz (4-2). Rudy Gobert added 15 points and 16 rebounds, and Mike Conley scored 19. Mitchell's desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer grazed the front of the rim. ""We knew it wasn't the last minute that lost us the game. It was things we did in between the quarters,"" Conley said. ""Defensively we weren't ourselves in different areas. They attacked us in pick and rolls, they were aggressive, and you can tell they were trying to get a win. They did everything necessary to do that. We didn't come with the same energy."" Nearly a week after getting blown out by the Jazz 113-81 in Salt Lake City, the Kings built an early lead, nearly gave it all away, then made a pair of big plays down the stretch to win. Utah trailed 97-88 before scoring nine straight to tie the game on Mitchell's 22-foot jumper. After Dewayne Dedmon made a 3-pointer for Sacramento, Mitchell fed Gobert for an alley-oop dunk, then scored on a layup to put the Jazz up 101-100 with 11.2 seconds left. Bjelica, who made three 3s earlier in the game, missed from the left corner with the clock running down, but Harrison grabbed the rebound and scored the winner. ""Belly had a good look, a look that we all have a lot of confidence in (him) to knock that shot down,"" Barnes said. ""(I) found a good bounce and was able to put it in."" It's the first time in six games that Utah has allowed more than 100 points. SEVEN AND OH NO Sacramento had trouble taking care of the ball and committed seven turnovers in the first quarter. The upside? Utah failed to score a single point off the mistakes. HOLDING NOTHING BACK Walton used his final timeout with 6:36 left to play, a risky decision but one the Kings first-year coach was comfortable with. ""It's a philosophy of mine when other teams are going on a run, let's see if the players can figure it out first,"" Walton said. ""Tonight I wasn't going to let that happen. We've been slipping too much when other teams go on runs."" TIP-INS Jazz: Ed Davis scored eight points in 21 minutes before leaving the game with a left lower leg contusion. . Jeff Green made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to end the third quarter. . Coach Quin Snyder was called for a technical when he angrily stormed onto the court after Jeff Green was called for an offensive foul in the third quarter. Kings: Fox made a nice move to shake Conley and left the Utah guard standing at the 3-point line, but missed an open dunk and the ball ricocheted to the other end of the court.","401160717"
"Draymond Green says he hurt his left index finger in Friday night's loss to the Spurs, impacting his ability to grip the ball. (0:29) SAN FRANCISCO --  Draymond Green and the Golden State Warriors are finding out what it's like to be a team saddled with injuries. Patty Mills came off the bench to score 31 points and the San Antonio Spurs beat Golden State 127-110 on Friday night, hours after the Warriors learned they will be without injured star Stephen Curry for at least three months. A sellout crowd of 18,064 was announced at Chase Center, yet there were a noticeable number of empty seats in the Warriors' new arena. Curry's injury has compounded things for a franchise that appears destined for a long season after appearing in the NBA Finals for five consecutive seasons. ""We went the bulk of five years being pretty healthy. We went the bulk of five years beating up on pretty much everyone,"" Green said. ""Right now, it's our turn to get beat up on. It's kind of what's going on."" LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points for the Spurs (4-1), who were coming off their first loss of the season a night earlier. D'Angelo Russell led Golden State (1-4) with 30 points. The game was an indication of the uphill battle facing Golden State without Curry, who underwent surgery after breaking his left hand Wednesday against Phoenix. The Warriors, also without injured guard Klay Thompson for at least the first half of the season, hope they won't be missing another star. Green had his left index finger wrapped after the game and said he's unsure if he'll be able to play Saturday against Charlotte. Russell couldn't carry the Warriors alone, even with three teammates in double figures. Rookie Jordan Poole scored 20. Warriors fans began filing out of the arena midway through the fourth quarter. Golden State is winless in three home games this season. Russell scored 19 points in the first half and the Warriors were within two points at the break, 57-55. The Spurs took control in the third period, scoring 40 points and taking a 97-86 lead. That included 12 points from Aldridge in the quarter and a 13-2 Spurs run. Mills, who starred in college for Saint Mary's in nearby Moraga, California, hit six of his nine 3-point attempts and finished three points shy of his career high of 34 points. That career-best game came against the Warriors on April 26, 2012. ""I mean, just (being in) attack mode mindset, being aggressive. I think that was more the key than anything,"" Mills said. ""You've got to be in that mindset."" TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge (eight rebounds) broke the 8,000-rebound mark and became the first NBA player to hit the 8,000-rebound and 18,000-point milestones since he was drafted in 2006. He's scored 18,689 career points. . Forward DeMarre Carroll, a 10-year veteran who signed a two-year deal with San Antonio in the offseason, entered in the first quarter for his season debut. He finished with two points. Warriors: Coach Steve Kerr stressed before the game that he would look to manage Draymond Green's minutes to keep him fresh. Kerr also acknowledged the importance of the veteran's leadership in light of numerous injuries. ""Right now he's kind of the lone survivor."" TEAM USA The U.S. national women's basketball team attended Friday's game and received a standing ovation. Team USA is playing an exhibition at Stanford on Saturday. ODD NIGHT What a crazy stat line for Spurs center Trey Lyles. He finished with zero points and 14 rebounds. LEE SHINES Warriors guard Damion Lee came off the bench to score 16 points. He scored a season-high 23 on Monday at New Orleans.","401160718"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Oklahoma City Thunder coach Billy Donovan has experimented with a three-guard lineup early in a rebuilding season. He had to go beyond that Saturday, due to injury, illness and foul trouble. With starting center Steven Adams sidelined by a knee injury for the second straight game and backup Nerlens Noel getting into foul trouble, Donovan went with a lineup that sometimes featured 6-foot-10 forward Danilo Gallinari and no one else over 6-6 on the floor. It was effective enough to hold New Orleans at bay and propel the Thunder to just their second win of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 23 points and eight rebounds, and the Thunder beat the Pelicans 115-104. Dennis Schroder and rookie Darius Bazley each added 17 points for the Thunder. Gallinari scored 16 points and Chris Paul finished with 15 points and nine assists. ""I thought it was a good team win because everybody contributed,"" Donovan said. ""I thought at the end of the third (quarter) and throughout the beginning part of the fourth, we got really good play from our bench."" Bazley saw his most extensive action, playing just under 19 minutes. Hamidou Diallo stepped up to play more than 29 minutes when starter Terrance Ferguson came down with flu-like symptoms in the first quarter, and he contributed 12 points, five rebounds and rim protection.  Noel managed to navigate around his foul trouble to block six shots. JJ Redick scored 17 points for the Pelicans, who were coming off their only victory of the season. The Pelicans played most of the game without leading scorer Brandon Ingram, who left midway through the second quarter with an injury. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 10 points in the first seven minutes and had 18 at halftime. Bazley scored eight points in the third quarter. The Thunder took a 94-86 lead into the fourth quarter. New Orleans cut it to 104-101 with 5:10 remaining on Redick's 3-pointer, but Paul and Gallinari responded with back-to-back 3 and Schroder took control of the game in the final minutes on defense as Oklahoma City pulled away. ""I thought Chris and Gallo were really efficient tonight with the way they played,"" Donovan said. ""I think everybody contributed today and that was good to see. Offensively, we continue to improve and get better."" Jahlil Okafor took advantage of Oklahoma City's lack of size, scoring 15 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, but he was ineffective down the stretch as New Orleans fell to 1-5. ""We keep turning the ball over; 17 turnovers for 23 points. You just can't survive that, especially on the road,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We've got to do a much better job protecting the ball. We've got to do a better job of getting back and getting our defense set. And then we've got to do a better job of executing down the stretch. We didn't do those things."" Ingram, who was averaging 26.8 points, appeared to try and intentionally foul Gilgeous-Alexander on a drive to stop play, but didn't get a whistle.  A few seconds later, on a dead ball, he came out of the game and went straight to the Pelicans locker room with an apparent head injury. He did not return to the bench for the remainder of the game, finishing with just seven points. New Orleans is already missing rookie No. 1 pick Zion Williamson, who is recovering from knee surgery. TIP-INS Pelicans: Lonzo Ball injured his ankle in the third quarter but was able to return to the game. He finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. ... This was the first professional meeting between Pelicans guard Nick Alexander-Walker and Gilgeous-Alexander, cousins who played in prep school together. Alexander-Walker checked in at the 3:17 mark of the first quarter to guard Gilgeous-Alexander. He didn't allow Gilgeous-Alexander to score in their first encounter but did pick up a foul trying to cover him. ""It was a surreal moment,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""It was something we dreamed about obviously our whole lives and for us to be able to actually live it out is crazy."" Thunder: Adams is listed as day to day.

"DETROIT -- Though Bruce Brown had career highs in points and assists on Saturday night, his coach was just as interested with a stat he didn't pile up. No turnovers. Coach Dwane Casey praised his second-year player after a 113-109 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, in which Brown had 22 points and seven assists in his first career start as a point guard. ""That was the key to the game was not letting them get out in transition,"" Casey said of the turnovers. ""He did an excellent job. Him being a point guard, that's why the summer league was beneficial for him, to make sure that he learned to run pick-and-roll, to run the team. He did a good job."" Andre Drummond had 25 points and 20 rebounds, and Luke Kennard finished with 24 points and helped seal the win with a driving basket and two free throws in the final 30 seconds of both teams' second game in two nights. Drummond had at least 20 points and 20 rebounds for the third straight game and fourth time in seven games this season. He added six assists, five blocks and three steals. ""He's a big guy, and he's skilled under there in terms of rebounding,"" Nets center Jarrett Allen said. ""He knows where to put his body and he knows where to put himself. At the end of the day, he has every skill set needed for it."" Kyrie Irving had his first triple-double with Brooklyn with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. He played well late but scored six points in the first three quarters, in part because of Brown's defense. The game swung wildly in the middle quarters. The Nets outscored Detroit by 15 points in the second quarter, and the Pistons turned it around for a 14-point advantage in the third. ""We were down 14 in the third quarter, but it was nothing but grit and grind to come back the way the guys did,"" Casey said. ""We've got to be that way every night."" The Pistons, who averaged 19.8 turnovers in the first six games, committed eight in the first half but none after halftime. Spencer Dinwiddie split a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds remaining, and Drummond did the same with 6.7 seconds left to put the Pistons up 111-108. Prince then split a pair, missing the second on purpose, and Drummond grabbed the rebound and made a pair with 3.6 seconds left to seal the win. ""For some reason we ran out of gas in the second half, and I'm not sure why,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Drummond had 11 rebounds in the first quarter and assisted the first three baskets. His playmaking was a boost for a team short on ball handlers. Playing without injured point guards Reggie Jackson (back), Derrick Rose (hamstring) and Tim Frazier (shoulder), the Pistons played Brown and Kennard at the position, with Drummond facilitating from the high post. ""It was a game of opportunity for some guys,"" Kennard said. ""Bruce, the way he stepped up tonight, he was kind of one of our leaders on the court. So credit to the kid. He played his heart out offensively and he was guarding their best player throughout the entire game."" Taurean Prince added 20 points and Joe Harris had 18 for the Nets. TIP-INS Brooklyn: Caris LeVert said Friday night's 25-point performance against Houston was in honor of his grandmother, who died this week. LeVert had 14 points on Saturday. ... DeAndre Jordan returned to the starting lineup for the third game this season. Atkinson said before the game that Allen has struggled against Drummond, and that could force a change. In three games against Brooklyn last season, Drummond averaged 9.3 offensive rebounds per game. Detroit: This was Detroit's third different starting lineup in seven games this season. ... The Rev. Jesse Jackson was in attendance. MONTH OFF Jackson is out at least four weeks with a back injury, the team announced earlier Saturday. Jackson, who played the season's first two games but has missed the past four, has a stress reaction in his lower back. The team announced treatment and rehabilitation has started and he will be re-evaluated in four weeks. All-Star Blake Griffin has missed all seven games with lingering soreness in his left knee and hamstring. It was announced before the season that Griffin would be re-evaluated in early November. MAKING HISTORY Drummond became the third player in the past 25 years to have three straight 20-point, 20-rebound games, joining Kevin Love and DeMarcus Cousins. There has been only one other 20-20 game this season, by Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers. TRIP-DUB Irving now has three career triple-doubles. He now has had one with each of his three career teams -- Cleveland, Boston and Brooklyn.","401160720"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets pushed aside the Orlando Magic to snap a two-game losing streak. Murray scored 22 points, Jokic had 20 points and seven rebounds and both made big late plays to help Denver beat Orlando 91-87 on Saturday night. ""It's the little stuff that's going to help us be successful on offense,"" Murray said. ""We all know we can shoot, we're struggling with shots right now, but all that will change sometime."" Jokic hit a shot from the corner with 1:53 left to put Denver up 84-81. Murray made a jumper with 1:24 left, drove for a dunk and an 88-83 lead with 35 seconds remaining, and wrapped up the victory with two free throws with 5.1 seconds left. ""If you're a good team, you don't go on extended losing streaks. That's the reality of the NBA,"" said Denver coach Michael Malone. ""If you're going to be a good team, you respond. ... So we got back to defending and play with great energy and sharing the ball."" Sixteen of Jokic's 20 points came in the second half. ""I was just more aggressive,"" he said. ""I just wanted to make them react to me, and that takes a lot of pressure off other players."" The Nuggets shot only 37%, but pulled ahead in the third quarter when the Magic made only seven of 25 shots. Nikola Vuevic scored 24 points for Orlando, and Aaron Gordon added 21 points and nine rebounds. Vucevic made his first five shots and helped Orlando to a 12-point lead, the largest of the game for either team. Two free throws by Torrey Craig with 4:01 left in the third quarter gave the Nuggets their first lead, 61-60. A 3-pointer by Malik Beasley stretched Denver's lead to eight early in the fourth quarter. Vucevic's 3-pointer tied it at 81 with 3:57 left, but Murray and Jokic scored nine of Denver's 10 points after that. TIP-INS Nuggets: F Will Barton missed a second game with an inflamed left toe. ... Coach Michael Malone burned two timeouts within 41 seconds during a first-quarter Magic run. ... F Michael Porter Jr., who played 21 minutes in his NBA debut Thursday night, had three points and four rebounds in seven minutes. ... Denver failed to score 100 points for the first time this season.

G Michael Carter-Williams missed a second straight game with a left hip contusion. FULTZ GETS FIRST MAGIC START Markelle Fultz started for the first time for Orlando, replacing D.J. Augustin at point guard. The first overall pick by Philadelphia in the 2017 NBA Draft, Fultz was traded to the Magic in February but did not play last season for the Magic. Augustin had started 115 straight games for the Magic going back to Feb. 8, 2018. MORE SHOTS FOR JOKIC Jokic took 14 shots, matching his total in the two preceding games. ""For us to be at our best we need him to take at least 15 shots a night,"" Malone said. ""That's a challenge for him the way teams guard him. Nobody's ever going to accuse Nikola Jokic of being a selfish player, but I need him to come out and set the tone early, be more aggressive and look to score. Now that's going to open things up for everybody else.""","401160721"
"WASHINGTON --  The Minnesota Timberwolves had no problem in their first game without star center Karl-Anthony Towns. Andrew Wiggins scored 21 points, Robert Covington and Jarrett Culver each added 20 and the Timberwolves cruised to a 131-109 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Towns was serving the first of a two-game suspension for fighting with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid on Wednesday. In his first four games, Towns was among the league leaders in scoring and rebounds. ""We knew we were missing Kat,"" Wiggins said. ""Kat's not somebody you can replace, so everyone had to step up, and that's what everyone did. ""You've just got to remember, we play a certain way. You don't want to get out of character."" Minnesota, which improved to 4-1 for the first time since 2012-13, had six players in double figures. Bradley Beal scored 30 points for Washington (1-4). The Wizards began the 2018-19 season with seven losses in eight games. ""We were in a fog,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""There's no excuses. It's on me."" Minnesota led throughout the game. The Wolves were already ahead by 10 with 3  1/2 minutes gone in the second quarter and increased their lead steadily. Wiggins' 3-pointer at the buzzer to end the third quarter extended the lead to 106-72. Gorgui Dieng, who started in place of Towns, scored 18 points. Jeff Teague had 15 points and 13 assists, and Jake Layman added 14 points. Dieng had played just six minutes all season, not getting to play in three of the first four games. ""Even though he wasn't playing this year, he stayed ready, he stayed in place,"" Wiggins said. ""And whenever he got his chance, he maximized it."" After losing 159-158 to Houston on Wednesday, the Wizards completely fell apart against the Timberwolves. Minnesota won the last meeting between the teams on March 9, and this game broke a pattern of alternating wins and losses over 20 meetings that began March 9, 2009. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Coach Ryan Saunders, who was an assistant coach in Washington under his late father, Flip, keeps a residence in Washington. ""This is almost like a second home to me,"" Saunders said. ""It was fun to be here with the Nationals, and that excitement. I can't claim the Nationals. I've always been a Twins fan. They're my second favorite team."" Wizards: F Rui Hachimura, who had 23 points in just his fourth professional game, was held to four. He missed nine of his 11 field goals. HARD DECISIONS FOR SAUNDERS Dieng has played each of his seven seasons with Minnesota, and Saunders wants him to earn his playing time. ""I want hard decisions when it comes to playing guys,"" Saunders said. ""That means guys are playing well and guys are buying in. But as we can see tonight, there's roles that we have on this team. And we want to make sure we put the best groups out there together. And then we also can keep guys in roles, too."" POINT GUARD WITHOUT TOWNS Teague acknowledged that it was a major adjustment to play without Towns. ""Karl is one of those talents where you've got to make a point to get him the ball,"" Teague said. ""He has the ability to do so many things. When he's out, it's a little different."" HACHIMURA'S SLUMP Hachimura entered the game averaging 18 points in his first four  Brooks knew he was due for a slump. ""You have one bad game,"" Brooks said. ""Let's not make it two. If it's two, let's not make it three."" By necessity, Beal must serve as a mentor to Hachimura. ""He'll learn that as he continues to play, the game will slow down for him,"" Beal said. ""Right now it's probably 100 mph.""","401160722"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Aron Baynes isn't worried about style points from 3-point range. The Australian center converted a career-best four 3-pointers Saturday night, leading to 20 points and the Phoenix Suns used a third quarter burst to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-105. Baynes' last 3-pointer came from a familiar spot around the top of the key and caromed in from straight away. He didn't really say whether he called bank. ""I could have made a better play, but at the end of the day, happy it went down,"" the 6-foot-10 center said, adding: ""Better to learn in victory than it is in defeat, though. We'll take it."" Devin Booker had 21 points to help the Suns improve to 4-2. He and Baynes combined to go 14 of 23 from the field and 7 of 10 from 3-point range, with Booker converting all three of his 3-point attempts. The Suns finished the night shooting 50%, including 14 of 34 from distance. Rookie Ja Morant led Memphis with 24 points and seven assists. Dillon Brooks and Brandon Clarke scored 16 points each, Clarke adding 11 rebounds. As it has through much of the early season, the game would get away from Memphis in the third quarter, part of the ongoing second-half problems for the young Grizzlies. Memphis has held halftime leads in all but one game this season, but have stumbled in the final two frames. This time, Phoenix outscored Memphis 37-22 in the third, with the Grizzlies committing 11 turnovers. That helped the Suns to convert a two-point halftime deficit into a lead that reached 14 as Phoenix carried an 82-69 lead into the fourth quarter. ""We came in (before) the third quarter and talked about the adversity we've faced this season, and how we need to stick together through it all,"" Booker said about the second-half change. ""Went out there, kept moving the ball. Started out very good in the third quarter and it just continued the rest of the game."" The second-half struggles are part of the growing pains for Memphis as it tries to make its way through a rebuilding phase around Morant and second-year forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who left the game in the third quarter with a right knee injury. ""Up (at) halftime, we've faced this before where teams pick up their energy,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""I didn't feel our energy was there in the third quarter."" TIP-INS Suns: Kelly Oubre Jr. added 15 points and Frank Kaminsky had 14, 11 in the first half. .Were 11 of 14 inside the arc in the first quarter; 2 of 7 from 3-point range. ...

They ranked in the bottom five in pace every season since 2012-13. ""When we started hitting the first day of camp, our guys really started to buy in,"" Jenkins said. ""Every single day we talk about our pace. Every day in film, we talk about our pace.""

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo carried a big chip on his broad shoulders against the Toronto Raptors. Antetokounmpo had 36 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and four blocks to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 115-105 victory over the Raptors on Saturday night in the first meeting between the teams since the Eastern Conference finals. ""Definitely, I had a lot of motivation,"" he said. ""Obviously, a different team. Kawhi (Leonard) is not on the team, but I think guys have stepped up. (Kyle) Lowry is still playing amazing. (Pascal) Siakam has stepped up a lot for this team. They are the team that cost us a trip to the NBA Finals. Obviously, you are going to come out and play a little bit harder and have a little bit extra juice in you."" Eric Bledsoe added 14 points and five assists, and Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each had 11 points for the Bucks. The Bucks had the best record in the East last season and then took a 2-0 lead over the Raptors in the conference finals, but Toronto took the next four en route to its first NBA championship. In this rematch, Lowry scored a season-high 36 points on 11-of-18 shooting, including 5 of 9 from 3-point range. Pascal Siakam added 16 for Toronto, which had won four of its first five this season. Marc Gasol grabbed 12 rebounds and had 10 points. The Bucks' habit of blowing big leads nearly cost them again. They led by 19 in the first half against Boston and 21 in the third quarter over Miami, but lost them both. ""We've got to get better,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's happened three times so far. We've got to get better and be in the moment. We cannot relax. People are coming after us. Nothing is going to be given to us."" The Raptors, who had trailed by as much as 26 points, pulled within four three times in the fourth quarter, the last on a 3-pointer from Fred VanVleet that made it 107-103 with 2:24 to play. Toronto coach Nick Nurse challenged the call on Siakam's sixth foul with 1:41 to play, but a review confirmed it and George Hill pushed the lead to six with two free throws. Antetokounmpo tacked on two more baskets and Bledsoe added one for the final margin. VanVleet, who finished with 12 points and seven assists, looked at this game as an early season matchup, a learning experience and nothing more. ""We didn't go into this with a playoff game-plan scheme,"" he said. ""We had a good game plan. We didn't execute it very well. There's going to be games like that."" Lowry's 17 points and 12 from Siakam pulled Toronto to 95-90 heading into the fourth quarter. The Bucks led 36-17 at the end of the first quarter and 66-50 at the half behind 17 points from Antetokounmpo and a dismal offensive showing from Toronto. The Raptors shot 13 of 41 from the floor. Siakam, Toronto's leading scorer averaging 28 points, had five points on 2-for-8 shooting. ""We played terrible. We couldn't make a shot. We couldn't do anything,"" Siakam said of the Raptors' first half. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had one game out of 65 last season with 30-plus points. ... Toronto shot 3 for 18 (16.7 percent) from the floor at the end of the first quarter. ... G Patrick McCaw missed the game with left knee pain.

QUOTABLE Reflecting on Lowry scoring 17 of his 36 points in the third quarter, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said, ""Hopefully, by the fourth, he was just fatigued. Or, the basketball gods said he can't play that good another quarter."" Lowry scored only two points in the fourth, a driving layup for the Raptors' final margin. STATS LINE Antetokounmpo had at least 35 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks in a game for the second time in his career. The first was last March 17 against Philadelphia. Siakam came in with three games of 30-plus points already compared to just five last season.","401160724"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Having lost two more starters to injury earlier in the day, Golden State coach Steve Kerr was in a remarkably pleasant mood considering his team's fifth loss in six games to start the season. Considering everything that's happened so far, Kerr had good reason to smile. The depleted and mostly inexperienced Warriors put together their best collective effort of the season and held a late lead before making a few costly errors down the stretch of a 93-87 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Baby steps, at the very least. ""Our guys played fantastic basketball and fought like crazy, and then their coach decided to screw things up at the end,"" Kerr said. ""We were right there. A couple things at the end if we could have executed a little bit better and if I maybe made a couple different decisions I think we would have been in good shape. Tough one but I'm really, really proud of the group."" Kerr hasn't had a whole lot to smile about this season, especially after his day began with news that Draymond Green will miss at least a few games with a torn ligament in his left index finger. D'Angelo Russell was also missing from Saturday's game due to an ankle injury. That left the Warriors looking more like a G League team than one that had won three titles in four years from 2015-18. Golden State was so short-handed that Kerr jokingly asked a reporter before the game about his availability to play. Turns out the Warriors, at least this version of the Warriors, did pretty well on their own for the most part. Terry Rozier made a short go-ahead jumper then added two free throws with 4.9 seconds left after missing three straight to help Charlotte hold on. Dwayne Bacon scored 25 points while Rozier finished with 20 points and seven assists to help the Hornets win their second straight after back-to-back losses to the Lakers and Clippers. Rozier felt Charlotte might have overlooked Golden State because of the Warriors' injuries. ""I feel like we didn't come out and treat it like we were playing the Lakers or Clippers just because of everything that has happened over there,"" Rozier said. ""We found a way to win. It was ugly, but we were able to pull it out in the end."" Erich Paschall had a season-high 25 points for Golden State (1-5) while starting in place of the injured Green. ""I feel like we took a good step in the right direction as a team,"" Paschall said. ""Even though everybody's out, just having fun. Today we did a good job of just going out there and having fun."" Kerr was forced to use his sixth different lineup in as many games as a result of the injuries. The new-look Warriors seemed to relish the opportunity early, scoring a season-high 30 points in the first quarter. But Golden State went cold down the stretch, was limited to two baskets over the final three minutes and committed a critical turnover trying to inbound the ball with 25 seconds remaining. ""We were trying to get an action out of that, something to try to free up somebody, but it didn't work out,"" Kerr said. Charlotte (3-3) trailed entering the fourth quarter but went on a quick run capped by Malik Monk's follow shot to take an 80-75 lead. Damion Lee's 3-pointer with 1:55 left tied it at 86, and Paschall added a free throw that put the Warriors ahead. But Rozier, who shot 8 of 17, made an 11-foot jumper. Rozier then missed two free throws, but Cody Martin made one and Rozier came back to make two more. TIP-INS Hornets: Miles Bridges had two points on 1 of 10 shooting . Charlotte was 1 of 11 on 3-pointers in the first half . Nicolas Batum sat out a fifth straight game with a fractured left finger. Warriors: Paschall has scored 20 or more in both games he started this season ... Green and Russell were both injured during Friday's loss to San Antonio. Green will be re-evaluated Monday.","401160725"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Philadelphia's Furkan Korkmaz was just as stunned as anyone by his game-winning 3-pointer against the Portland Trail Blazers. Korkmaz hit his 3 with just 0.4 seconds left and the unbeaten 76ers rallied for their fifth straight victory, 129-128 on Saturday night. ""I didn't know how to feel or how to act. It was the biggest shot of my career,"" he said. Anfernee Simons made a corner 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds left to put Portland in front but the Sixers got the ball back after a timeout to set up Korkmaz's falling-down, 24-footer for the win -- without suspended center Joel Embiid. The 76ers are the last undefeated team in the league with their first 5-0 start since the 2000-01 season, when they opened with 10 straight victories en route to the Eastern Conference championship. The Blazers led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter but the Sixers closed the gap to 103-100 on Raul Neto's driving layup with just over 10 minutes left. Damian Lillard's 3-pointer with five minutes to go put Portland up 121-113. Portland's Rodney Hood, who finished with 25 points, left the game with 4:29 left after he tangled with Tobias Harris. It appeared that Hood injured his left knee. Ben Simmons and Al Horford made back-to-back dunks to pull Philadelphia within 125-124. Mario Hezonja fouled Simmons with 10.1 seconds left and he made both to give the Sixers the lead. Korkmaz called his 3 to win it a ""dream come true."" ""We were working on that in practice. I knew that if I was open I would take the shot. That was my mentality when I was going in,"" he said. Said Simmons: ""As soon as I saw Furk open -- I think he was shocked he was that open -- I trusted Furk to make that shot."" Horford finished with 25 points and Harris added 23. Simmons had 18 points and 11 rebounds. Lillard had 33 points, including eight of Portland's 19 3-pointers. ""We played such a great game and they just chipped away, got back into it and we let one slip,"" Lillard said. ""I think the way we lost sucks. Any time anybody hits a last-second shot, and puts you up against the clock, it's a bad feeling. "" Embiid was serving the first of a two-game suspension for an altercation with Karl-Anthony Towns during the 76ers' 117-95 home victory Wednesday over the Timberwolves. Both were ejected from the game and Towns was also suspended for a pair of games. Embiid was averaging 25.3 points and 10.3 rebounds to start the season. Rookie Matisse Thybulle got his second start of the season for the Sixers, but Korkmaz started the second half. The Blazers said before the game that center Hassan Whiteside would not be available because of a left knee bone bruise. That put Portland in a tough position because Zach Collins was already out with a dislocated shoulder. Fellow big man Pau Gasol was still rehabbing from offseason foot surgery and Jusuf Nukic isn't due back until the new year after his breaking his leg last season. Whiteside was averaging 12.8 points and 12.2 rebounds with the Blazers in the team's first five games. Portland started Anthony Tolliver and Hezonja up top against the Sixers, along with Hood. The Blazers led 32-27 going into the second quarter, with Hezonja leading the way with 10 points. Philadelphia tied it at 45 midway through the quarter on James Ennis III's 3-pointer. But the Sixers could not pull in front and Hood made back-to-back 3-pointers and Lillard added another to put the Blazers up 60-48. Portland led by 68-57 at the break and Lillard's 3-pointer extended Portland's lead to 93-72. Philadelphia closed the gap with a 12-point run that narrowed Portland's lead to 102-98 with 10:48 left in the game.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  His sixth NBA season has been a slow transition in getting acclimated with a new team, so T.J. Warren admittedly was pressing too much. On a Sunday night when the Indiana Pacers had a makeshift lineup with three injured starters sidelined, Warren adjusted well to playing a more prominent role with a season-high 26 points in a 108-95 home win over Chicago. ""It's definitely been a process,"" said Warren, acquired in the offseason after five years with Phoenix. ""I'm just trying to figure out how I can fit in and where I can be effective on this team. It's a whole new system with guys who have been together for like a month and a half now. We're still learning each other."" Warren, a 14.4-point scorer with the Suns, was averaging 12.8 points for the Pacers (3-3) after a humbling 3-point effort on 1-of-8 shooting in a Friday home win over Cleveland. But this night the shots were falling from the outset as he scored 14 first-half points to help the Pacers take a 13-point lead at the break. ""It's more just him trying to find his rhythm and get a feel for where his opportunities are coming,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""We're still early. It's going to take some time with this group getting a feel for each other."" A Pacers squad already missing its best player -- All-Star guard Victor Oladipo has yet to make his season debut in his recovery from knee surgery -- was also without forward/center Myles Turner (ankle) and center Domantas Sabonis (calf contusion). That meant McMillan was tinkering with lineups he hadn't even tried in practice, but they worked as the Pacers won their third straight game and sixth in a row against the Bulls (2-5). ""Guys have to be ready to step up and play when that opportunity presents itself,"" McMillan said. ""I thought tonight, as a group, we did."" Point guard Malcom Brogdon had 22 points and seven of the Pacers' team-high 28 assists. ""Having Victor out, you know the type of player he is as an All-Star, and still being able to win games and put it together, it's been huge for us,"" Brogdon said. ""But to have Myles and Domas out and still get this win, it's huge for our confidence."" Reserve forward TJ Leaf took advantage of extra minutes as a backup center with his second career double-double, 13 points and 15 rebounds. The third-year pro had entered with seasonal averages of 2.8 points and 2.5 rebounds. The Bulls (2-5), winless in five road games, lamented a lost opportunity against an opponent missing key players. ""We've been the short-handed team that went out and scrapped it and junkyard-dogged it and beat teams that maybe we shouldn't have beaten,"" said Bulls coach Jim Boylen. ""We haven't been the team that's favored very often. And maybe that's the lesson we've got to learn, that whether you're favored or not, or whether they're hurt or not, you've got to bring it."" Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 21 points and Wendell Carter Jr. added 20. ""We've got to take advantage of opportunities like this,"" said Bulls reserve forward Thaddeus Young, who had 12 points. ""I told the team in the postgame meeting this is what we call a trap game. We just didn't take advantage."" TIP-INS Bulls: LaVine joined select company on Friday in his 93rd game in bumping his career point total to 2,020.

"MIAMI -- The game wasn't over after 16 minutes. Forgive Miami and Houston if they felt otherwise. Duncan Robinson scored 23 points, Meyers Leonard added 21 and the Heat -- fueled by one of the biggest first-quarter margins in NBA history -- ran out to a 59-18 lead on the way to an easy 129-100 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night. ""Surprising? Not surprising to me,"" Leonard said. ""Don't get it twisted. The Houston Rockets are incredibly talented. But we came in with a game plan and a mindset that we were going to take away what they're good at, be disciplined and execute. That's what we did."" Jimmy Butler scored 18 points and had nine assists for the Heat, and James Johnson scored 17 in his season debut. Miami is 5-1, matching the best six-game start in franchise history. James Harden scored 29 for Houston, while Russell Westbrook was held to only 10. Westbrook also posted a career-worst -46 plus/minus. His previous worst was -36 at Washington on Feb. 13, 2017, according to ESPN's Stats &amp; Information. The Heat had 38 assists to Houston's 19, and the Rockets were just 14 of 48 from 3-point range. ""We're not in trouble,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said after his team fell to 3-3. ""But if we think we're not in trouble, then we're in trouble -- if that makes sense. You've got to have that appropriate fear and understand that it's a new year and you don't start with any games and we've got to work our way back."" It was a record-setting opening quarter for the Heat -- resulting in the third-biggest lead after 12 minutes in the NBA's shot-clock era, starting with the 1954-55 season. Miami led 46-14 after that first quarter. The only bigger leads after one quarter since the shot clock was put into play came when the Los Angeles Lakers led the Sacramento Kings 40-4 after one quarter on Feb. 4, 1987, and the Baltimore Bullets leading the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 45-12 after one quarter on Dec. 9, 1972. ""They came out and blitzed us,"" Harden said. ""They brought energy and effort that we couldn't match. And it showed."" It was the biggest margin by which the Heat had outscored an opponent in any quarter -- and the biggest margin by which the Rockets had ever been outscored in a period. Miami outscored New York by 28 in the first quarter on Jan. 22, 2007; the then-San Diego Rockets were outscored by 28 against Atlanta in the third quarter on Feb. 11, 1970. The lead was 59-18 four minutes into the second quarter. Houston got within 25 points by halftime, but no closer from there. ""The energy, I don't have many complaints,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Guys really brought it tonight."" Goran Dragic scored 15 points and Tyler Herro had 12 for Miami. Chris Clemons had 16 and Ben McLemore scored 14 for Houston. TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook started 1 for 9 from the field, 0 for 5 from 3-point range -- with his first make from beyond the arc coming on a 45-footer that beat the third-quarter buzzer. That got Houston within 99-71. ... The Rockets have faced deficits of at least 13 points in four consecutive games -- the other three falling well shy of the 41-point hole Houston quickly dug Sunday. ... Houston has now lost 13 of its last 17 games in Miami, and trails the all-time series with the Heat 33-32. Heat: Miami had a 48-point quarter at New York in 1989 and a 47-point quarter at Boston in 1990. The 46-point quarter was a Heat home record. ... Chris Bosh and Ray Allen -- who teamed up for one of the biggest plays in NBA Finals history, the rebound and 3-pointer late in Game 6 of the 2013 series against San Antonio -- were in attendance. So was Dorell Wright, part of the 2006 Heat NBA championship team. ... Justise Winslow (lower back stiffness) missed his second consecutive game. Derrick Jones Jr. (left groin) and KZ Okpala (left Achilles) were inactive. HARDEN'S SHOOTING Harden was 6 for 14 from the field and 3 for 9 from 3-point range -- not great numbers for an elite scorer like him, but his percentages for the season actually rose. He's up to 37% from the field now through six games, 22% from 3-point range. All-time in Miami, Harden is shooting 39% from the field, 33% from beyond the arc. CLEMONS DEBUTS Clemons, the third-leading scorer in NCAA Division I men's history and someone who averaged 30.1 per game as a senior at Campbell last season, made his NBA debut. Clemons scored 3,225 points in 130 college games, and was 5 for 18 from the floor Sunday.","401160728"
"NEW YORK --  The Sacramento Kings left home on a high note and are feeling even better after their first stop on the road. De'Aaron Fox scored 24 points, Buddy Hield had 22 and the Kings routed the New York Knicks 113-92 on Sunday night for their second straight victory following a 0-5 start. Harrison Barnes added 19 points and Richaun Holmes finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings, who brought the momentum from their 102-101 home victory over Utah on Friday east and ran away from the Knicks. ""It's kind of important to come out with a good start, especially flying across the country,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""I was very happy with our guys' effort level, performance level."" Sacramento led by as many as 32 points in a surprisingly simple start to a three-game road trip. Nemanja Bjelica chipped in 10 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and the Kings limited the Knicks to 38% shooting. ""I think it was our defense,"" Fox said. ""I think obviously you have to put the ball in the basket, but the way we've performed I think the last three or four games have been fantastic."" Marcus Morris scored 28 points for the Knicks, who dropped their third straight and fell to 1-6. Rookie RJ Barrett had 22 points. ""I really expected us to take a step forward tonight, but we didn't,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. Sacramento led by nine after one quarter, then opened the second with an 11-0 run to build a 43-23 lead on Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer with 7:34 remaining in the half. New York didn't score until more than five minutes had elapsed in the period, and after clawing back within 12 later in the quarter, promptly gave up the next nine points as the Kings pushed the lead to 55-34. ""You don't want that type of result or effort coming in after we had two extremely hard-fought games on the road that we gave ourselves a chance to win,"" forward Julius Randle said. ""Tonight we came in and we didn't give ourselves a chance at all."" A 61-41 halftime lead quickly was expanded to 76-44 on Fox's jumper, and boos broke out during a third quarter that ended with Sacramento ahead 90-64. TIP-INS Kings: Luke Walton's pregame interview with reporters was attended by a couple special guests. His father Bill, a Hall of Fame player, stood in the back along with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead. Both wore Kings sweatshirts. ""In the NBA season you're on the road a lot, so any time you can have family and friends around, it's a nice mini break,"" Luke Walton said. ""But they know and we know we're here for business. We're here to try to get better as a team and try to win a game."" ... The Kings have won the last four meetings. Knicks: Second-round pick Ignas Brazdeikis made his NBA debut in the fourth quarter. He scored four points. ... Fizdale changed up his starting lineup, inserting Bobby Portis at center in place of Mitchell Robinson. Portis scored two points. Robinson had 10. ... The Knicks remained short-handed in the backcourt, with point guards Elfrid Payton (strained right hamstring) and Dennis Smith Jr. (personal reasons) still out. FATHER KNOWS BEST Though Bill Walton has been a popular TV broadcaster and is known for his loquaciousness, he picks and chooses his spots when it comes to talking to his son about the game. ""My dad's been great my whole basketball career, whether I was a player or now into coaching,"" Luke Walton said. ""He offers advice when I want it and he knows when to leave me alone. So he's a great person to be able to talk to and communicate about the game, what he sees, but he also knows that this is my job and I'm doing it. So, when and when not to put his voice in there."" ROUGH FOR RANDLE Randle was limited to eight points and seven rebounds on 4-for-13 shooting. He has been in single digits in scoring the last two games after opening the season with five straight double-doubles.","401160729"
"SAN ANTONIO --  For a player who wasn't even part of the Los Angeles Lakers' plans this offseason, Dwight Howard is providing a powerful impact alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Davis had 25 points and 11 rebounds, ames added 21 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds and Los Angeles held off the San Antonio Spurs 103-96 on Sunday night. Howard had 14 points and 13 rebounds in a throw-back performance to help the Lakers improve to 5-1. He was 7 for 7 from the field. ""Just effort and energy,"" Howard said. ""(James and Davis) are going to take most of the scoring bulk, so my job is just to make sure I clean up all the mistakes. On the defensive end, be a force, make guys take tough shots and be aggressive. I enjoy it."" Dejounte Murray had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Spurs, Rudy Gay added 16 points off the bench, and DeMar DeRozan had 14. They lost for the second time in three games to drop to 4-2. James also had a triple-double Friday night in an overtime victory in Dallas. The Spurs rallied in the fourth just as the Mavericks did in forcing overtime, but this time Howard put a stop to rally in regulation. Howard missed all but nine games last season with the Washington Wizards after suffering a knee injury. The 15-year veteran remained an unsigned free agent until August when the Lakers took a chance after DeMarcus Cousins was lost for the season with a knee injury. The signing has been huge for Los Angeles, which has the best record in the Western Conference. ""Any time he's on the floor, he always seems to do something huge for us,"" Davis said. Howard had 10 points, six rebounds and two blocks in the fourth quarter. The Spurs closed to 77-72 on Gay's 37-footer to end the third quarter and 87-85 on Murray's short jumper midway through the fourth. Murray finished 7 for 12 from the field. ""He is like a young pup,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said, ""and he is trying to figure it out. He's got speed, he's aggressive and, at the same time, he's trying to learn to run the show and find people and take good shots."" Murray's three-point play on a foul against James and subsequent driving layup tied it at 90 with 4:10 remaining. The Lakers went on a 7-0 run, capped by a dunk follow by Howard. The center flexed after the basket to the roar of the many Los Angeles fans in attendance. ""Dwight Howard was huge,"" James said. ""Every minute that he played. Great performance by him, crashing the glass, catching lobs, getting great strips defensively, giving us extra possessions. He was vintage tonight in the minutes that he played."" The Lakers missed their first three shots and had two turnovers but the Spurs only managed a 5-0 lead. The teams combined to commit 13 turnovers in the first quarter in a sloppy start to a battle between the early leaders in the Western Conference standings. The Spurs were 4 for 16 on 3-pointers in the first half and finished 6 for 25 on 3s. ""Defense, that's our staple,"" James said. ""We've been talking about it and we believe it. No matter how it's going for us offensively. If we're struggling to shoot the ball, if we turn the ball over, we have to still continue to get stops and we did that tonight in a very hostile environment. An environment that's very tough to win in, I know from experience. It's a very good win for us early in the second."" The Lakers outscored the Spurs 30-18 in the second quarter, including an alley-oop from Howard at the 3-point line to Davis. TIP-INS Lakers: James won at the AT&amp;T Center for the first time since 2015. . Lakers fan Calvin Broadus, aka Snoop Dog, sat courtside. He received a Spurs jersey with Snoop Dogg and No. 19 on the back, which he sheepishly accepted while wearing a purple Lakers jacket. ...

Spurs: Derrick White fell on his right hip and backside early in the fourth quarter after being fouled by Dwight Howard. Derrick White remained on the court for about 45 seconds before rising and gingerly walking off the injury. Officials reviewed the play and ruled it was a common foul against Howard. HAVING FUN Howard is relishing every moment with the Lakers after missing most of last season with a knee injury. ""Being injured sitting at home, watching basketball watching TV and stuff like that is kind of hard,"" Howard said. ""So, I promised myself when I got back on the court I was going to have the most fun as I can but enjoy the moment and try to help my team win whatever situation I might be put in.""","401160730"

"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard showed just how much of a difference he can make for the Los Angeles Clippers. Leonard scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Clippers to a 105-94 victory over the Utah Jazz on Sunday night. Last Wednesday at Utah, the Jazz beat the Clippers by 15 points with Leonard sitting out. The following night, Leonard returned to the lineup and scored 38 points in a win over San Antonio. ""Great job, the last two games we just grinded out physical, hard playing defensive games,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I guess that's what Kawhi can do, really. I thought Kawhi and Lou Williams started running some good stuff together and we're going to get better and better at it."" Against the Jazz, Leonard helped the Clippers erase a double-digit second-half deficit and remain unbeaten (4-0) at home. He shot just 9 for 26, but with the score tied at 86, Leonard scored six points to key a 19-8 run to close out the victory. ""I think it's just about taking advantage of the moment and not shying away,"" Leonard said. ""You're not gonna make every shot that you shoot to win a game or every shot in the fourth quarter, so to me it's about keep being aggressive and keep having fun."" Montrezl Harrell. Who had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Clippers, was also singing Leonard's praises. ""Kawhi is a winner,"" Harrell said. ""He's a superstar and he knows how to win. He's won multiple big stages."" Six of Harrell's rebounds were on the offensive end and came at a critical point in the game down the stretch.

We kept finding ways to get the ball and give ourselves an extra possession."" Williams added 17 points for the Clippers Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 36 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 19. ""We made lots of little mess-ups and screw-ups late in the fourth quarter and that cost us the game,"" Mitchell said.

After trailing by eight points in the opening quarter, the Clippers opened the second on a 20-4 run. Landry Shamet's 3-pointer gave Los Angeles a 36-24 lead with 4:53 to go. The Jazz responded with a 17-3 run to finish the quarter and Mitchell's basket in the final minute gave Utah a 41-39 lead at the break. Both teams shot under 35 percent in the opening half. Leonard shot 1 for 9 in the first half and scored only five points. LAC outrebounded the Utah 54-37 in the game and forced 14 turnovers. ""The difference was that they were able to get offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter,"" said Jazz coach Quin Snyder, whose team has dropped two straight. ""If you don't get defensive rebounds, it's a killer."" TIP-INS Jazz: Utah coach Quin Snyder served as an assistant for the Clippers for the 1992-93 season.

"WASHINGTON --  Knowing he's the on- and off-court leader of a revamped roster filled with youth and inexperience, Bradley Beal was pleased to see the way his Washington Wizards reacted to what he called ""laying an egg."" One game after a lackluster loss, the Wizards ended Detroit star Andre Drummond's 20-20 streak and picked up their second victory of the young season, beating the depleted Pistons 115-99 in a half-empty arena Monday night. ""Still a lot of things we've got to work on, get better at,"" said Beal, who had 22 points and six assists. ""But it is definitely a good sign to see, after last game."" Two nights earlier, Washington was beaten by 22 points at home by the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were missing the suspended Karl-Anthony Towns. So what if Detroit was without Blake Griffin (left hamstring and knee), Derrick Rose (right hamstring) and Reggie Jackson (lower back)? ""It's the NBA. There are no excuses,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We got enough guys in that room to compete, to fight."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who doesn't have All-Star point guard John Wall, was thrilled with the way his players responded to the criticism they heard during film study of the Timberwolves game. ""We were disappointed. We were. There's no way around it. It was a bad night on both ends of the floor,"" Brooks said. ""One thing I love about it: We came back. We took it on the chin. ... We needed them to get better from it. Sometimes when you have a team that doesn't have a lot of experience, a loss is a loss if you don't learn anything from it."" The Wizards improved to 2-4 thanks to 14 points and seven rebounds from Thomas Bryant, and nine points and six assists from Isaiah Thomas in his first start of the season. Rookie Rui Hachimura bounced back from his worst game as a pro with 10 first-quarter points for Washington and ended up with 12 points and four rebounds. In the previous game, Hachimura -- the first Japanese player taken in the opening round of the NBA draft -- shot just 2 for 11 and had season lows of four points and two rebounds. One key Monday was that Drummond did not continue to fill the stat sheet the way he has been. Bidding to become the first player in at least 35 seasons to post four consecutive games with 20 or more points and 20 or more rebounds, he got there in one of the categories, finishing with 15 points and 24 rebounds. Drummond shot 6 of 20, going 1 of 8 in the fourth quarter as Washington pulled away. ""We just tried to make everything difficult for him. Try and get into his airspace,"" Bryant said. ""Try and make everything super-hard for him."" At halftime, Washington was up by only 63-61. But the Wizards pulled away in the third quarter, and a layup by Troy Brown Jr. in the last minute of that period got their lead up to 93-75. ""They out-scrapped us,"" Casey said. ""Outworked us.""

"NEW YORK --  Brandon Ingram had the best game of his career. The New Orleans Pelicans had the best quarter in their history. Somehow, the Brooklyn Nets found a way to win on a night when the hits kept on coming. ""We took a combination, a haymaker, however you want to call it, couple left hooks in the jaw in the third quarter, and I thought in the fourth quarter we did a better job and slowed them down a little,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Kyrie Irving had 39 points and nine assists, and Brooklyn withstood Ingram's career-high 40 points to beat the Pelicans 135-125 on Monday. The Nets had 67 points at halftime and a 20-point lead in the third quarter, but could never get comfortable until the final minute as Ingram kept coming at them. He shot 17 for 24 from the field in his first 40-point game and the Pelicans scored a franchise-record 48 points in the third quarter. They got within two in the fourth but could never get enough stops to catch the Nets. ""I just felt like I was in rhythm. Still missed some layups. Still missed some 3s. I could have (done) better,"" Ingram said. Caris LeVert added 23 points, Joe Harris had 19 and Jarrett Allen finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who follow this game with a five-game road trip, their longest of the season, with the first four in the West. ""We obviously wanted to come out and win this game and really put a statement down for the rest of the week before we go on this long trip, so it was good,"" Irving said. Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball each scored 15 points and Josh Hart had 14 for the Pelicans, who fell to 1-6. Brooklyn led by only two after Ingram's three-point play with 4:58 remaining in the half, but the Nets scored 10 straight. Five of them came in one trip when Allen made two free throws after being flagrantly fouled by Ingram -- he actually made the shot while being thrown to the ground, but the foul had been called on the floor -- and Garrett Temple made a 3-pointer after Brooklyn retained possession. Brooklyn later got consecutive jumpers by Irving and a dunk from Spencer Dinwiddie to close a 20-3 run and make it 63-44. Irving scored 18 points in the third but the Pelicans were a sizzling 8 for 11 from 3-point range and scored 48 points, trimming a 20-point deficit to 104-98 heading to the fourth. ""We decided to play 20 minutes in a 48-minute game and that doesn't work out. At least it hasn't in the 31 years I've been in the NBA,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Their previous best was 47 points in a quarter, and their best third quarter was 41 points. ... Ingram played just 13 minutes in his previous game against Oklahoma City on Saturday because of a head injury. Nets: DeAndre Jordan limped off early in the fourth quarter with a sprained left ankle after appearing to step on JJ Redick's foot while running down the court. ... Irving has scored at least 20 points in all seven games. The longest streak of 20-point games to open a season by a Nets player belongs to Richard Jefferson, who did it in eight straight in 2007-08.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Houston Rockets didn't let Sunday's anemic performance at Miami carry over into the second night of a back-to-back. With James Harden leading the way with 44 points, Houston was much more solid on Monday night, beating the Memphis Grizzlies 107-100. After the game, many of the Rockets referenced the 129-100 loss to the Heat, in which Houston trailed by 41 points in the first half. ""We got smacked in the mouth in the first quarter. That should leave a mark,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game.

The former MVP finished 12 of 28 from the field, including 7 of 16 from 3-point range. He added 10 rebounds and six assists. Harden said a better energy level contributed to a better performance. ""When you bring energy to the game, good things happen for you and for our team,"" Harden said. ""If you don't bring energy (and) you're not active, good things won't happen. That's what happened (Sunday) night."" Eric Gordon added 16 points, while Danuel House Jr. scored 15. Clint Capela had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Rookie Ja Morant led Memphis with 23 points and six assists. Dillon Brooks scored 17 points. Jonas Valanciunas had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Morant was 10 of 16 from the field. There were 15 ties and seven lead changes, and the game was tied at 70 midway through the third period. Memphis, which has seen leads dwindle with poor second-half performances, saw Houston score 11 straight points, including six by Harden, to break the tie and build a cushion. Memphis never got closer than six points the rest of the way. ""Tough third quarter, in a sense, for both teams,"" Memphis first-year coach Taylor Jenkins said, ""but I really liked the way our guys competed in the second half."" TIP-INS Rockets: Closed out a four-game trip at 2-2. ... Have reached at least 60 points in the first half in four of eight games this season. ... Harden has 40-plus points in four straight games against the Grizzlies. ... D'Antoni challenged a foul against Ben McLemore in the fourth quarter, but officials upheld the call after review. Grizzlies: F Jaren Jackson Jr. (right knee soreness) and G Grayson Allen (left ankle) sat out the game. Both left Saturday's loss to Phoenix in the third quarter. ... With Jackson out, rookie Brandon Clarke made his first NBA start. ... Dillon Brooks grabbed a career-high nine rebounds. ... Memphis trailed at halftime for the second time this season. ... Were called for five technical fouls in the game. ... Were outscored 22-16 in the third. Memphis has not won a third quarter this season. ROOKIE RECORDS Morant has scored 117 points this season, the most by a Grizzlies rookie in his first six games. He also is the first rookie since the team moved to Memphis in 2001 to record consecutive games with at least 20 points and five assists. ""He's a beast, man,"" Harden said of the second overall pick in this year's draft. ""He's aggressive. As a young guy in this league, some guys tend to be nervous. He has no nerves at all."" TESTY TIMES The game got testy with about two minutes left when Grizzlies forward Jae Crowder appeared to take a shot to the groin while guarding Harden. After the foul was called on Crowder, Harden and the Grizzlies exchanged words, leading to a technical against Crowder along with ejection. Harden was called for a flagrant-1 foul after a review by officials. LAST WORD ""It was better, but it was so bad (Sunday) night. So, the bar was really low."" -- D'Antoni.","401160735"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The start to the game was unusual. Giannis Antetokounmpo's final stat line was not. After waiting out a long delay, Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 15 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 134-106 on Monday night. Antetokounmpo, the reigning NBA MVP, has posted a double-double in all seven games this season. ""Once you go out there, you have a mindset that you're going to play a game, you're going to go hard,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Once you cannot go hard, you've got to almost switch mindsets."" The game was delayed 50 minutes so one of the baskets could be fixed before tipoff. During pregame warmups, the rim the Bucks were shooting on was discovered to be crooked. ""I was making shots,"" Antetokounmpo joked. ""So I was happy. Once they said the rim is crooked, I was like, `Oh yeah, that's why I was making a lot of shots.' Yeah, it was disturbing, because everybody was ready to go. We had to wait, like, probably, what was it, an hour?"" If the Bucks were thrown off by the delay, it didn't show. Milwaukee shot 53.8 percent from the field. Khris Middleton added 26 points to match his season high, and Eric Bledsoe set a season best with 22. Bledsoe also had nine rebounds and six assists. ""There's just no excuses,"" Middleton said. ""We just had to stay professional and be as ready as we could."" Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 25 points. Minnesota played without center Karl-Anthony Towns, who served the second game of his two-game suspension for his part in an altercation with Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid last week. Robert Covington added 15 points. The Bucks outscored the Towns-less Timberwolves 62-38 in the paint. ""They're a good team,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""You know, the credit goes to them. They overwhelmed us a little bit in the third quarter."" Milwaukee broke open the game with a 38-point third that included a 22-6 run. Antetokounmpo scored 11 points and grabbed five rebounds in the period. ""We didn't make shots. We got stagnant,"" Covington said. ""We didn't come out with the urgency that we know we needed to. Just too much playing catch-up."" The Bucks were up seven at halftime thanks in part to coach Mike Budenholzer winning a coach's challenge with 0.2 seconds left in the second quarter. That overturned an offensive foul on Antetokounmpo and resulted in a layup for him. Donte DiVincenzo scored a season-best 17 off the bench for Milwaukee. ""A little bit of a strange night between the beginning and different things during the game,"" Budenholzer said. ""I thought the guys had a great focus. I thought the third quarter was really good."" TIP-INS Bucks guards Wesley Matthews and Pat Connaughton returned to action. Connaughton (right shoulder strain) sat out Saturday's win over Toronto, while Matthews injured his ankle Saturday and played only nine minutes. Timberwolves center Gorgui Dieng made his second consecutive start in place of the suspended Towns. Backup point guard Shabazz Napier left in the fourth quarter with a strained right hamstring. He is day-to-day. KILLING TIME The Bucks spent the delay in the locker room, telling stories about odd events they'd experienced in their careers or watched on TV. ""The first thing that came to mind for me was back when prime Shaq was breaking backboards every other game,"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said.","401160736"
"PHOENIX -- Devin Booker was pouring in buckets from every corner of the court during the second half, and the home crowd loved every minute of it, serenading the Phoenix Suns star with MVP chants as he finished with 40 points in a 114-109 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. The 23-year-old guard did a lot of losing during his first four seasons in the desert. That's why these moments -- even though it's very early in year five -- are feeling awfully good. ""That's the love I get here. It's been unconditional since Day 1,'' Booker said. ""It's good to feel the energy in there. The fans are getting what they want -- a hard-working team that pushes the issue every night.'' Phoenix (5-2) continued its run as one of the most surprising teams in the NBA, knocking off the previously undefeated 76ers, who played without star center Joel Embiid because of his two-game suspension for an altercation with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns on Oct. 30. Ricky Rubio added 21 points and 10 assists for the Suns, who are three games over .500 for the first time in more than four years. Phoenix is on a three-game winning streak and off to its best seven-game start since 2013. The Suns are also now 7-0 against the spread this season. They're the fifth team in the past 30 seasons to cover each of its first seven games of a season and the first to do it since the 2015-16 Orlando Magic. Booker now has 6,003 points in his career, becoming the eighth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 6,000. He turned 23 last week and finished Monday's game 15-of-19 from the field, including 3-for-4 from 3-point range, and 7-of-7 on free throws. ""I've said it for a while: He's a complete basketball player,'' Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""He's competitive, not afraid of the moment. He makes big plays.'' Phoenix pushed ahead 100-93 midway through the final quarter, but the lead quickly disappeared and Al Horford tied the game when he came flying down the lane for a one-handed, putback slam. From that point, it was back and forth until the Suns went up in the final few minutes when Booker and Kelly Oubre Jr. made big baskets to put them in front for good. The Sixers (5-1) were led by 32 points from Horford. He tied a career high with five 3-pointers and shot 13-of-20 from the field. Tobias Harris added 24 points and Furkan Korkmaz had 20. ""We have to definitely give them credit,'' Harris said. ""They came out and played a heck of a game. They were able to make shots.'' Horford nailed a 27-foot 3 at the buzzer to put the 76ers ahead 61-55 at halftime. The 13-year veteran shot 6-of-7 from the field in the first half, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range. ""For the last couple of games, obviously with Joel being out, I felt like I've had to step up a little more, be more aggressive and look to score,'' Horford said. ""Tonight, the way they were defending me, it gave me a lot of looks, and I took advantage of that.'' A BIG DIFFERENCE SO FAR Phoenix won its fifth game, which is already more than 25 percent of the way to its win total of 19 last season. The Suns haven't made the playoffs in a decade and have been particularly bad over the past four years, with an 87-241 record and no more than 24 wins in any of those seasons. TIP-INS 76ers: G/F Shake Milton didn't play because of a bone bruise and mild sprain in his left knee. ... Ben Simmons had five steals in the first half and finished with seven. ... Embiid is eligible to return when the 76ers visit the Jazz on Wednesday. Suns: G Ty Jerome missed his seventh straight game to start his rookie season because of a right ankle sprain. ... The Suns trailed by six at halftime despite shooting 55% from the field. ... Booker scored the Suns' first 11 points of the third quarter and had 16 in the period. ...

"SAN FRANCISCO --  Those familiar chants of ""M-V-P!"" weren't for Stephen Curry this time but rather a rookie named Eric Paschall, who delivered a special performance on his 23rd birthday. Not to mention the Warriors' first win at new Chase Center -- finally. Paschall hit a key 3-pointer with 4:05 remaining and finished with 34 points and 13 rebounds, leading injury-plagued Golden State to a 127-118 victory over Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. ""That was a little crazy. For a rookie you hear MVP, that's a `wow' moment,"" Paschall said. ""I thank Dub Nation for believing in me."" Without all their injured stars, the young Warriors more than hung tough against a Western Conference contender as Klay Thompson cheered from the sideline. Golden State (2-5) improved to 1-4 at home -- the team hasn't started 0-5 in its own building since losing its initial six home games in 1997-98. ""Just a fantastic effort by the whole group. Everybody that we put in came in and gave us big minutes,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""It was just fun. It's a fun group to coach because they're young and hungry and they were fighting like crazy out there the whole game. That's a good team they just beat. It was a great night for us."" Lillard, no longer playing in his hometown of Oakland when he visits the Bay Area, notched his fourth 30-point performance in the first seven games with 39 points on 15-for-26 shooting, including five 3-pointers. Blazers center Hassan Whiteside added 22 points and 11 rebounds after missing one game with a bone bruise in his left knee. Golden State, which swept Portland in the Western Conference finals last season on the way to a fifth straight NBA Finals, led 90-83 early in the fourth quarter before the Blazers fought back. ""They competed from the beginning, they played hard, they moved the ball really well,"" Lillard said. ""They played like a team that wanted to win. We got outplayed start to finish, I would say. We had some moments in the game, but we played like we just thought we were going to march in here and win the game, and they showed why they're in the NBA. That's a tough loss."" Paschall's late 3 put the Warriors ahead 107-99. Chants of ""M-V-P!"" greeted him when he shot free throws with 2:22 left. He also hit a pair of 3-pointers to start the game and made his initial 3 from deep. He scored 17 points in the opening period, and Paschall has scored 20 or more in all three games he has started. He had 25 in Golden State's loss to Charlotte on Saturday, becoming the first Warriors rookie with back-to-back games of 25 points since Curry had five in a row in April 2010, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ""He came in and didn't look like a rookie at all, from the first day of practice,"" Kerr said. Fellow rookie Ky Bowman had 19 points and eight assists for the Warriors, who faced their worst start since beginning the 2000-01 season 1-7.  But Golden State made five of its first eight shots to take an early 14-9 lead and kept bringing the energy and enthusiasm on both ends. Paschall and Bowman combined to shoot 20 for 33 -- 11 of 19 by Paschall. He also made all eight of his free throws. With 6:13 to go, Bowman drove to the basket and scored, then tangled with Whiteside, who pushed off with an elbow. Officials went to replay and issued Whiteside a technical. CJ McCollum had 14 points and six assists for the Blazers, whose previous four games were decided by a total of nine points, including a 129-128 home loss to the 76ers on Saturday. Kerr knew the terrific backcourt tandem of Lillard and McCollum provided a tough matchup. ""They're really tough to guard even for a veteran team. For a young group, we're probably going to learn some lessons tonight,"" Kerr said before the game. NO SPLASHING The Warriors improved to 3-10 without Splash Brothers Curry and Thompson, according to Elias -- 1-2 this season, 2-6 in 2018-19, 0-1 in 2016-17 and 0-1 in 2015-16. Playing without just Curry, Golden State is 44-68 since 2009-10, including 5-8 last season. FIRST RESPONDERS The Warriors hosted firefighters and first responders from the devastating Kincade Fire in Sonoma County.  They were shown on the big screen midway through the second quarter and drew cheers. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard has scored at least 20 points in eight straight games against the Warriors. ... The Blazers have played five of their seven games on the road. ... Lillard averaged 28.3 points and 6.5 assists in four regular-season games vs. Golden State last season, when the teams split four meetings. Warriors: Paschall became the first Warriors rookie with 17 or more points in a quarter since Reggie Williams had 18 in the fourth period against Phoenix on March 22, 2010, according to Elias. ... Draymond Green missed his second straight game with a torn ligament in his left index finger, while D'Angelo Russell also sat out his second consecutive game because of a sprained right ankle. Kerr hopes Russell will play Wednesday at Houston. F Kevon Looney, who missed his sixth game in a row because of neuropathy, hasn't received any answers yet on his condition and won't travel with the team to Houston on Tuesday, though Kerr said, ""I wouldn't rule him out of the whole trip.""","401160738"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Bismack Biyombo spent the better part of three quarters stretching and waiting on the Charlotte Hornets bench. The reserve center had a feeling his time was coming. ""I always say, `You gotta stay ready so you don't have to get ready,"" Biyombo said. ""You could tell by the momentum of the game that we were going to need some energy from somebody."" Devonte Graham scored a career-high 35 points, Biyombo provided a huge spark off the bench late and the Hornets battled back from a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Indiana Pacers 122-120 in overtime Tuesday night. Graham sank 2 of 3 free-throw attempts with 1.7 seconds left in overtime after drawing a foul on JaKarr Sampson, helping the Hornets win their third straight game. But it was Biyombo who changed the momentum when he entered to start the fourth quarter with the Hornets trailing 92-78. He made an immediate impact, scoring down low to start the quarter before coming up with a block against T.J. McConnell that led to a three-point play by Terry Rozier on a fast break. Biyombo then stole the ball at midcourt and went in for a one-handed dunk. He added several put-backs along the way, giving Charlotte a presence it badly needed on the glass. Biyombo finished with 15 points on 6 of 7 shooting, six rebounds and two blocks in 17 minutes. ""I thought Biz turned the game, just his energy, his defense ... he was all over the place,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. Graham added to a spectacular start to his second NBA season. When he wasn't getting steady updates from teammates on the Duke-Kansas college basketball season opener, he was making plays all over the court. He shot 11 of 20 and had four more 3-pointers, along with six assists, four rebounds and three steals. Graham struggled shooting from the outside on the team's four-game road trip but fixed that Tuesday night. ""Let me tell you, I stayed in the gym last night,"" Graham said. ""I came in early this morning, I was in the gym. I worked out more than usual."" Borrego called him a winner. ""To continue to play this way, to be poised and unfazed, he's grown right before our eyes,"" Borrego said. ""I trust him, believe in him and I think that's apparent. I think our guys do also. He's a special player."" Terry Rozier added 22 points and Miles Bridges had 18 for the Hornets (4-3). T.J. Warren scored 33 points on 15-of-18 shooting and Malcolm Brogdon added 31 points for the Pacers (3-4). But it was enough, as Indiana had its three-game winning streak snapped. Several Pacers mentioned the discrepancy in the foul count. ""They were the aggressors, they were marching to the free-throw line,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""They shot 42 free throws tonight and we only shot seven free throws. Offensively we had some opportunities and we didn't make plays. It comes down to making plays and getting stops and they did tonight."" TIP INS Pacers: Jeremy Lamb had 18 points in his return to Charlotte. ... Goga Bitadze and TJ Leaf both fouled out. ... Myles Turner (sprained ankle) and Domantas Sabonis (strained calf) continued to be held out while rehabbing injuries. Hornets: Rookie P.J. Washington suffered a lower left leg contusion, Borrego said. He continued his impressive season scoring 16 points, including a driving left-handed dunk over Sampson that brought the crowd to its feet. ... Graham, Biyombo and Rozier combined to score 40 of the team's last 42 points. THE NO-CALL McMillan didn't agree that Graham was fouled by Sampson with 1.7 seconds left in overtime. ""Devonte was driving a lot tonight and initiating the contact, I didn't feel that was a foul at all,"" McMillan said. ""He got two calls tonight that our guys had their hands up. He is initiating the contact and he got the free throws on that. We did get a lot of fouls this game, but I did not think that was a foul."" THE SAME FIVE The Hornets played the entire fourth quarter and overtime with the same five players -- Graham, Biyombo, Rozier, Bridges and Cody Martin. Martin didn't score in 33-plus minutes but had 11 rebounds and made a major impact on the game with his defense on Brogdon in the fourth quarter and overtime. Only Rozier and Bridges are regular starters.","401160739"
"CLEVELAND --  Gordon Hayward capped a perfect night from inside the arc with the biggest basket of the game. Hayward tied a career high with 39 points, making all 16 of his 2-point attempts, and the Boston Celtics won their fifth straight game by holding off the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113 on Tuesday. Hayward hit 17 of 20 shots, including one 3-pointer. He put in Kemba Walker's miss with 22 seconds left to give Boston a five-point lead. Walker stole the inbounds pass and sank a free throw to put the game away. The only person in the building who wasn't impressed with his perfection on 2-pointers was Hayward. ""It seems like a pointless stat to me,"" he said. ""Tonight just felt sweet because we got the win, but I wish we could have closed out better."" Celtics coach Brad Stevens took a different point of view. ""Certainly, you always felt like he could get a bucket at any time,"" Stevens said. ""He was aggressive going to the basket. He did a good job when guarded by big guys. He did a good job when guarded by small guys."" Walker had 25 points for Boston, which hasn't lost since the season opener against Philadelphia. ""That's pretty impressive,"" he said of Hayward's stat line. ""He made all his 2s and only missed three 3s. That's nuts."" Hayward scored 16 points in the opening quarter and 22 in the first half, hitting all nine attempts from the field. Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. had a simple assessment of the performance. ""He didn't miss,"" Nance said. ""He's crafty. He plays the game at a very cerebral level."" Hayward suffered a horrific leg injury in Cleveland during the opening minutes of the 2017-18 season opener. He averaged 16.5 points in two games at Cleveland last season. ""I don't think about it,"" Hayward said. ""I haven't thought about it for a while. Hopefully, you guys won't be asking about it again."" Collin Sexton, who scored 21 points, hit a 3 with 1:33 to play that cut Boston's lead to 116-113. The score remained that way until Hayward's crucial basket after his offensive rebound. ""Probably a case, I don't know what the film's going to show, ball-watching,"" Cavaliers forward Kevin Love said. ""I'd gone for the rebound and he just crashed weak side."" Boston was 48 of 85 from the field (56%). Jayson Tatum scored 18 points and Carson Edwards had 13. Tristan Thompson had 19 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland, which has lost three straight. Love scored 17 and Larry Nance Jr. 15. TIP-INS Celtics: C Enes Kanter (bruised left knee) missed his fifth straight game. Stevens said Kanter ""really wants to play, but our medical staff doesn't feel like he's ready yet."" ...

Getting to see my family is what I'm looking forward to."" SITTING OUT Cavaliers rookie Kevin Porter Jr. missed the game after being suspended by the NBA for bumping official Bill Spooner in Sunday's loss to Dallas. Porter brushed into Spooner's shoulder as he ran back down the floor after missing a shot at the end of the third quarter, knocking the official off balance. ""He was very contrite, very disappointed in himself,"" Cleveland coach John Beilien said. ""He apologized to the official right away. You cannot do that with the officials. You can't come close to them like that. I think we all realize that.""","401160740"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young came through just as the Atlanta Hawks were trying to put John Collins' suspension in perspective. Young scored 28 of his 29 points in the second half, Jabari Parker added 19 points and the Hawks moved past Collins' issues to snap a three-game losing streak with a 108-100 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night. Young, returning after missing one game with a right ankle sprain, put on some dazzling moves in the fourth quarter to help his team overcome the loss of Collins, who was suspended earlier in the day for 25 games without pay for a violation of the NBA's anti-drug program after testing positive for a growth hormone. ""Everybody stepped up in a big way,"" Young said. ""Like I say, we're going to miss John. He's a big piece of our team. It's not easy, but they did a great job. We've just got to take it game by game, but we did a good job today."" DeMar DeRozan scored 22 points, Bryn Forbes had 17 and Patty Mills 16 for the Spurs. San Antonio has dropped three of four. The 6-foot-1 Young put on a dribbling display that stopped 6-11 LaMarcus Aldridge cold, then zipped a brilliant pass from the right-side perimeter to a cutting DeAndre' Bembry for a dunk that put the Hawks up 95-88 with 4:52 remaining. Young had 13 assists. ""I cut to the rim as he was looking for someone to do,"" Bembry said. ""It was perfect timing. It was a great pass, a hell of a pass, and just made two points."" The crowd roared again after Young fell backward while hitting a 3 from the right corner to make it 104-96 with 2:11 remaining. It was a stark contrast from the first two quarters when Young was 0 for 8 from the field but had eight assists. ""He was cold in the first half and probably getting some rust off a little bit, I would imagine, but the second half he was great,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He played confidently, whether he was driving it for little runners or shooting the 3. He did a great job."" The Spurs led by eight entering the fourth but were outscored 38-22. Young, who went 5 for 10 beyond the arc, had 16 points in the final period. San Antonio led 45-44 at halftime with DeRozan, Mills and Parker each scoring 10 points. The Spurs were just 8 for 33 on 3s and missed seven free throws. Parker replaced Collins, the team's leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. The Hawks hit seven 3s in the fourth , but DeRozan blamed San Antonio's late defensive lapses for letting the game slip away. ""We were getting stops,"" DeRozan said. ""We were being aggressive. That was the main part. We made them miss a lot of shots, then they caught a rhythm in the fourth quarter after we lost that lead in the third quarter.""

"CHICAGO --  LeBron James and Anthony Davis watched and cheered as Kyle Kuzma powered a big fourth-quarter run for Los Angeles. Sure, James was his usual brilliant self. But Kuzma's performance was a big deal for the rolling Lakers. James had 30 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his third consecutive triple-double, and Los Angeles rallied to beat the Chicago Bulls 118-112 on Tuesday night for its sixth straight victory. Kuzma scored 11 of his 15 points in the final period during his third game after missing the start of the season with a right ankle injury. The 24-year-old guard got hurt while playing for USA Basketball this past summer. ""I'm getting there,"" Kuzma said. ""It's a process, I know. It's all about being patient right now because I haven't really had much basketball time since August."" Kuzma averaged 18.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game last season. The Lakers are hoping he can provide a viable third option alongside the leading duo of James and Davis. ""Kuz got into a rhythm, and that's what he's capable of,"" James said. Los Angeles trailed by 19 before outscoring Chicago 38-19 in the fourth during the finale of a three-game trip. Kuzma began the quarter with seven straight points, part of a 16-0 run that lifted the Lakers to a 96-93 lead with 8:12 left. James was on the bench for most of the big spurt, and Davis watched the entire run from the sideline. ""A.D. was in foul trouble. Bron was exhausted,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""Both of those guys needed to stay on the bench and other guys needed to step up, and they did."" Chicago lost for the fifth time in six games. Zach LaVine scored 26 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. had 11 points and 11 rebounds in his third straight double-double. Coby White and Otto Porter Jr. each scored 18 points. ""This one hurts,"" LaVine said. ""We were beating them up until the fourth quarter. We're showing we can play with these teams. We know we're talented. We've had 10-, 12-, 16-point leads on a lot of teams, but we're losing games. It's frustrating."" The Bulls used a 16-2 run to open a 60-42 lead with 2:49 left in the first half. Carter's two foul shots made it 63-44 with 2:10 to go. ""We've got to learn to finish,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""They finished and we didn't."" Kuzma got some help as the Lakers rallied in the fourth. Quinn Cook scored eight of his season-high 17 in the final period. Dwight Howard had a key block on White during the big run. James helped close it out after he checked in with 8:37 remaining. He found Davis for an alley-oop jam that made it 114-101 with 2:04 left. Davis finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in his first game in his native Chicago since he was acquired in a trade with New Orleans. TRIPLE THE FUN James became the first player to post three consecutive triple-doubles for the Lakers since Magic Johnson had four in a row in 1987. ""It comes with team success for me,"" James said. ""A triple-double means absolutely nothing to me if it's not in a win."" OLD FRIENDS Boylen worked for Vogel for two seasons with the Indiana Pacers. Vogel called Boylen ""one of the smartest basketball men I've ever worked with,"" and Boylen also heaped praise on his former boss. ""Frank's a worker.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  After blowing a five-point lead against Portland a week ago, the Oklahoma City Thunder turned up the focus on defense late in games. It worked against New Orleans on Sunday, and the Thunder did it again Tuesday night, riding 24 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to a 102-94 victory over the Orlando Magic. ""I thought we executed very well and then we defended really, really well coming down the stretch,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""I've seen significant growth and improvement from the guys."" Chris Paul added 20 points -- eight in the final 2:09 -- along with six assists for the Thunder (3-4), who held their opponent under 100 points for the fourth time in seven games. Steven Adams had 11 points and 11 rebounds. ""We're sort of figuring it out, finding some sets that we like to go to,"" Paul said. Aaron Gordon had 15 points and eight rebounds to lead the Magic (2-5), who scored just 15 points in the fourth quarter and have yet to reach 100 in a game this season. Orlando had six players reach double figures in points, including Jonathan Isaac, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. Nikola Vucevic had 10 points and 11 rebounds. ""I thought we did a lot of good things,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We were right there. We've got to find ways to score in the fourth quarter. We've got to be able to step up and make some of those, we had a couple of wide-open ones there. It's the difference between winning and losing."" Oklahoma City led 58-53 at halftime and managed to hold onto the lead until Al-Farouq Aminu's two free throws tied it at 81 early in the fourth quarter. The Magic tied it at 83 a couple of minutes later but never regained the advantage. They pulled within 88-87 on Gordon's long jump shot with 4:44 remaining, but Oklahoma City used a 9-2 run over the three-plus minutes to regain control. Both teams shot poorly in the fourth quarter, with the Thunder at 33.3 percent (7 of 21) and Orlando at 26.3 (5 of 19). ""We've got to make shots, we are shooting a terrible percentage as a team,"" said Gordon, whose team shot 39 percent (32 of 82) on the night. ""I think we are doing an OK job on defense, but you aren't going to win the game without offense."" TIP-INS Orlando: Evan Fournier entered tied for the team lead with 16.8 points per game but managed just four, all free throws, while shooting 0 of 7. It was his first game this season in single digits. ... The Magic held the edge in rebounds, 53-38, with 16 offensive boards, including 11 in the first half. ... Orlando held a significant advantage in bench points, outscoring the Thunder's reserves 39-26. Oklahoma City: Denis Schroder averaged 19.5 points over his previous four outings but scored just five in this one, shooting 2 of 11 from the floor. ... The Thunder hold a 10-2 record against Orlando at home, winning four in a row. TRIBUTE Before the game, the Thunder paid tribute to the victims of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, inviting family members of the 168 people killed in the attack onto the court for a short observance prior to the national anthem, while holding up customized Thunder jerseys with the number 95 on it, along with the last name of their loved one.","401160743"
"DENVER --  Will Barton put his best foot forward in a return from a toe injury. Barton had 15 points and 10 rebounds while leading Denver's resurgent transition game and the Nuggets pulled away in the second half to beat the Miami Heat 109-89 Tuesday night. ""I think Will, when he's locked in and focused like he's playing right now, he gives you a lot of positives on both ends of the floor,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Jamal Murray had 21 points and Jerami Grant also had 15 for the Nuggets, the first team this season to hold Miami under 100 points. Jimmy Butler had 16 points on 3-of-12 shooting while being guarded mostly by Barton. Kelly Olynyk added 13 points for Miami, which was outshot from the floor by the Nuggets 52.3 percent to 36.4 percent. ""I was in a good place before this injury and I feel like I'm pretty much back there,"" said Barton, who missed the previous two games. ""I was a little rusty tonight, a little winded. I had a couple of unnecessary turnovers."" When he was in, he was spearheading the Nuggets defense, hitting the boards and helping to lead the team's fast break. ""That's when I'm at my best, when I'm getting defensive rebounds and then going down and finishing and putting pressure on the defense,"" he said. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the Nuggets seemed to be a step ahead of the Heat throughout much of the game. ""They were the aggressors,"" he said. ""We weren't able to impose our will for any long stretches of the game defensively and you could see that early on with allowing 30 points in the paint. They played well and it wasn't really a competitive game in the second half."" Up by 10 at halftime, the Nuggets doubled their lead with a strong third quarter in which they outscored the Heat 31-20 despite losing Paul Millsap to a facial laceration early in the period after Gary Harris left near the end of the second quarter with an ankle injury. Monte Morris converted a three-point play in the final moments of the third, helping the Nuggets take an 89-68 lead into the fourth. Morris finished with 11 points. Denver scored eight of the next nine points starting the final quarter, capped by Torrey Craig's dunk off a lob pass from Nikola Jokic to move in front 97-70 with 8:58 left to play. Bam Adebayo's driving layup broke the Nuggets' surge but not enough to alter the outcome for the Heat, who had trailed by a point after the first quarter. Denver substituted freely in the final minutes. The Nuggets closed the last 5:04 of the second quarter on a 16-5 run to take a 58-48 lead at halftime. Barton began the flurry by converting a go-ahead three-point play and also connected on a 3-pointer during the surge. BACK IN THE GROOVE Monte Morris left his slow start to the season behind with a sparkling 11-point, eight-assist effort off the bench. ""I call it just a mini-slump, but it really wasn't a slump for me, honestly,"" he said. ""The same shots I was missing, I'm making now. I just feel like I'm more engaged on both ends and trying to make an impact whenever I'm out there."" TIP-INS Heat: F KZ Okpala was sidelined by a left Achilles tendon strain. ... F/G Derrick Jones Jr. is back from a left groin strain that sidelined him the previous four games. ... F/G Justise Winslow returned to action after missing two games with lower back stiffness. Nuggets: Barton returned to the starting lineup after missing the past two games with a swollen left toe. ... Harris left the game late in the second quarter with a left ankle sprain and was ruled out for the remainder of the contest. ... Millsap suffered a cut on his forehead when he collided during a third-quarter fast break with Meyers Leonard, who was called for a flagrant 1 foul. Team trainers stopped the bleeding with a headband bandage and Millsap made both free throws before being replaced on the floor by Grant.","401160744"
"DETROIT --  Tony Snell connected from beyond the arc to open the scoring in the first few seconds of the game. Little did anyone realize he was on his way to a memorable night. Snell scored 24 points on 9-of-9 shooting, and the short-handed Detroit Pistons had little trouble with New York, beating the Knicks 122-102 on Wednesday. Snell made six 3-pointers, becoming the first player in franchise history to shoot 100 percent from the field with at least six 3s. He was only the ninth player in NBA history to do it. ""They just depend on me to go out there and do what I do best, and shoot the ball. The best way to do it is to have ball movement,"" Snell said. ""They're very confident in me. I'm confident as well."" Andre Drummond had 27 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists, and Markieff Morris added 22 points for Detroit. The Pistons played without their injured trio of Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose and Reggie Jackson. Detroit still shot 56 percent from the field and dropped the Knicks to an NBA-worst 1-7. New York's Mitchell Robinson left the game with concussion-like symptoms. The Pistons have won eight straight meetings with New York. Detroit led 64-59 at halftime. It was 74-72 when Morris made a 3-pointer while being fouled. It was ruled a flagrant foul on Julius Randle, and after Morris made the free throw for a four-point play, Drummond added a layup immediately after. ""It's tough to weather a six-point play,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""It's actually the first game I've seen it since I've been coaching."" That sequence started a 10-0 run that pushed the lead into double digits. Langston Galloway also had a four-point play for the Pistons in the fourth quarter. Randle led the Knicks with 20 points, and Marcus Morris contributed 18. SHARING THE BALL The Pistons had a season-high 37 assists, even though they were playing without some of their most experienced playmakers. Drummond finished one assist short of a career high. Luke Kennard had 12 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Galloway and Bruce Brown had six assists apiece. ""The ball was moving, they found the open person. It didn't stick,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""Guys didn't drive in the paint and take midrange shots. I thought we did a better job with our shot spectrum tonight, and that's where the rhythm of the shots came."" PERIMETER DEFENSE Snell wasn't the only player making outside shots for Detroit. Morris made four 3-pointers, and the Pistons were 15 for 30 from long range as a team. ""These are the best players in the world. They hit shots,"" Knicks guard RJ Barrett said. ""I think Tony Snell didn't miss a shot today. But it happens. That's basketball. Life happens and we've just got to move to the next one."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York was without Dennis Smith (personal reasons), Kadeem Allen (right foot strain), Elfrid Payton (right hamstring strain) and Reggie Bullock (cervical disk herniation). Pistons: Griffin hasn't played this season because of hamstring and knee issues. Jackson, who has had back problems, has only appeared in two games. Rose missed a third straight game with a right hamstring strain. Detroit was also without Tim Frazier, who has a right shoulder strain.","401160745"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Nate McMillan wanted to see adjustments and quick, and the Indiana Pacers head coach saw what he looking for in a 121-106 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. ""We showed them tape (from Tuesday night's loss) of our shot selection, shooting the floaters, not taking the extra dribble, getting to the rim and drawing contact,"" he said. ""Tonight I think we did a much better job of not settling for floaters and the ball movement was great."" T.J. Warren scored 21 points to lead the Pacers (4-4), who were playing their third game in four nights. Doug McDermott came off the bench and scored 17 of his 19 points in the first half. ""I can shoot it anywhere,"" McDermott said. ""I'm excited to just make some shots. It's always good."" Aaron Holiday finished with 18 points. Domantas Sabonis, who missed the last two games with a left calf contusion, had 13 points and tied his career high with 17 rebounds before fouling out with 3:20 left to play. Bradley Beal had 30 points, five rebounds and five assists to lead the Wizards (2-5), who have lost four of five games. Thomas Bryant had 20 points and 11 rebounds and C.J. Miles added 15 points. JaKarr Sampson scored 14 points in a 22-2 run in the third quarter to help Indiana build a 23-point lead. Sabonis' two free throws with 5:22 remaining in the third put the Pacers ahead 92-67. The Wizards closed out the third quarter scoring 11 straight points, capped off with Beal's jumper just before the buzzer to make it 94-80. ""There was a point where we couldn't get stops,"" Beal said. ""The whole second quarter and part of the third quarter hurt, too. We've got to defend better than what we did tonight."" The Pacers led by 13 in the first half with Malcolm Brogdon's free throw for a technical called on Wizards coach Scott Brooks with 1:21 remaining in the second quarter. Bryant converted a 3-point play at the end of a 6-2 run to close out the second, and the Pacers led 70-62 at halftime. TOP SCORE Indiana's 121 points was the most points scored in a game this season by the team. The Pacers also recorded a season-high for points scored in a quarter with 44 in the second period, and most points in a half with 70 points by halftime. BEAL VS. INDY Beal scored more than 25 points in three of the four meetings between the Wizards and the Pacers last season. And he quietly did it again this time, too. He had 21 points by halftime and then scored four points in the third quarter and five in the fourth quarter.

"ATLANTA --  For the second night in a row, the Chicago Bulls took a big lead into the fourth quarter. This time, they didn't let up. Tomas Satoransky scored a career-high 27 points and the Bulls won for just the third time in nine games with easily their most impressive performance of the young season, routing the Atlanta Hawks 113-93 on Wednesday. ""We were all frustrated by the way the last game went,"" said Satoransky, who went 10 of 13 from the field, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. The Bulls built a big lead against LeBron James and the Lakers the night before, only to get outscored 38-19 in the fourth quarter of a 118-112 loss. Taking out their frustration on the Hawks, this one was total domination. Satoransky had not scored more than nine points this season. He really went off on the Hawks, beating his previous career best of 25 while also dishing out eight assists. Zach LaVine even got a chance to put on his version of Showtime, blocking De'Andre Hunter's 3-pointer to set up a 360-degree dunk at the other end. ""We put it together tonight,"" Coby White said. ""Both halves."" Atlanta made a season-low six of 30 attempts from 3-point range, turned it over 24 times and trailed by double digits over the final 41:29. ""Our guys were not ready,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said bluntly. ""We just didn't care."" The Bulls took control with a 28-6 run in the opening quarter. Otto Porter Jr. led with way with 10 points, including a couple of 3-pointers. Satoransky chipped in with seven points, Kris Dunn added five and Lauri Markkanen knocked down a 3 to push Chicago to a 30-12 lead. Porter went down before halftime with a bruised left foot and did not return. He wasn't needed. The Bulls were up 56-41 at the break, closing the half with a couple of quick passes around the perimeter to set up Satoransky's 3 from the corner as the buzzer sounded. It was the lowest-scoring first half of the season for the Hawks. Chicago stretched the margin as high as 28 points. ""We played 40 really good minutes last night and that's not enough,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""They were hurting from the way the game ended last night."" Starting his second straight game in place of John Collins, Jabari Parker led the Hawks with 18 points. Collins is serving a 25-game suspension after violating the NBA's doping policy. But Pierce wasn't in the mood to praise anyone. ""The only positive from this game: It's over,"" the Atlanta coach said. ""We don't have to worry about it anymore."" YOUNG STRUGGLES It was a miserable night for Atlanta's Trae Young, on the heels of a dazzling 29-point, 13-assist performance in a victory over San Antonio the previous night. The point guard managed just nine points and three assists, missing all eight attempts beyond the arc. ""Coming off a big win, you've got to be mentally focused. You've got to approach every game like it's your last,"" Young said. ""We didn't do that."" Pierce said the Bulls were determined to stop Young after he scored 49 points against them in a game last season. ""They're not going to forget that,"" Pierce said. ""That's the way they're going to play Trae every game the rest of his career."" TIP-INS Bulls: Connected on 13 of 33 from 3-point range. ... Markkanen added 17 points, Porter finished with 13 in just 11 minutes, and three other players reached double figures. ... Boylen said he won't have an update on Porter's condition until the team gets back to Chicago. Hawks: Vince Carter, 42, had a season-high 14 points. ... Kevin Huerter, with 12, was the only other Atlanta player in double figures. ... Young wasn't the only player who struggled.

""You've got to beat people with your readiness.""","401160747"
"TORONTO --  Pascal Siakam and the Toronto Raptors are confident they can play better. Sacramento Kings coach Luke Walton, meanwhile, found reason to be happy with his team despite another loss. Siakam had 23 points and 13 rebounds, Kyle Lowry scored 24 and the Raptors held on to beat the Kings 124-120 Wednesday night. ""We didn't win like we wanted to,"" Siakam said, ""but we got the win and that's all that matters."" Toronto built a 36-23 advantage after the first quarter, but the Kings outscored the Raptors in each of the final three periods and cut a 15-point deficit to three in the fourth. ""They were hard to get rid of,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. Serge Ibaka scored 10 of his 21 points in the fourth and OG Anunoby finished with a season-high 18 as the Raptors won their fifth straight over the Kings and improved to 4-0 at home this season. ""We have to continue to get better and grow as a team,"" Lowry said. ""We take the win, figure it out and get better."" Lowry has scored 20 or more six times in Toronto's first seven games. The reigning NBA champions were 12-3 last season when Lowry had at least 20 points. ""He's doing it all,"" teammate Fred VanVleet said. ""Whatever we need on a nightly basis, he's been giving it."" Lowry led the Raptors with six assists and was one of three Toronto players with two steals. ""He does everything that you want a leader to do,"" Kings guard De'Aaron Fox said. VanVleet and Marc Gasol each scored 12 for Toronto. Gasol's total was a season high. Harrison Barnes had a season-high 26 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 13 of his 22 in the fourth quarter and Buddy Hield added 21 as the Kings had their modest two-game winning streak snapped. Sacramento had beaten Utah and New York after five straight defeats to begin the season. ""I'm happy for the direction we're moving,"" Walton said. ""It's a tough place to play, it's the NBA champs, and they were making a lot of shots tonight."" Fox had 17 points and nine assists for the Kings, and Cory Joseph scored 10 against his former team. Hield missed a jump shot that would have made it a two-point game with 35 seconds left in the final period and the Raptors ahead 122-118. Ibaka grabbed the rebound, and VanVleet capped it with a pair of free throws. ""I feel like we threw punches and we landed a few,"" Fox said. ""We would bring it to within four and then they would execute, execute. That's what a championship-level team does."" The Kings matched a franchise record by making 20 3-pointers. Sacramento took 43 shots from behind the arc. Toronto missed four straight shots to start the game, then connected on 14 in a row through the remainder of the first quarter. Lowry's driving layup with 1.4 seconds left gave the Raptors a 13-point edge after one. ""That first quarter, we shot ourselves in the foot,"" Fox said. Walton shared those sentiments. ""We can't give up 36 points on the road in the first quarter against the champs,"" Walton said. ""Now we're playing catch up the rest of the night."" TIP-INS Kings: Trailed at halftime for the second time this season. Sacramento also was behind at the half in an Oct. 26 loss at Utah. ... First-year assistant coach Roy Rana began his career in Toronto, first as a high school coach and later as head coach at Ryerson University, where his team lost consecutive Canadian national championship games in 2017 and 2018. ...

"HOUSTON --  Despite an entirely different lineup of Golden State Warriors, James Harden was still out for blood Wednesday night. Harden had 36 points and 13 assists and the Houston Rockets routed Golden State 129-112, sending the short-handed Warriors to their sixth loss in eight games this season. Less than six months ago, a vastly different roster of Warriors ended another Houston playoff run for the third time in four seasons. ""That's a part of the league,"" Harden said about the changing faces. ""It's a part of the NBA. There's been a lot of different faces since I've been here. It was bound to happen at some point and it is what it is."" Harden again appeared to be moving past his early shooting woes, going 6 of 16 from 3-point range. Since going 17 of 79 on 3s in his first six games, Harden has made 13 of 32 the last two. Harden's 292 points through the first eight games (36.5 points per game) mark the highest point total through eight games since Michael Jordan had 303 in 1988-89. Russell Westbrook had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. P.J. Tucker had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Clint Capela added 19 points and 16 rebounds, and Austin Rivers was 4 for 4 from 3 with 12 points. Alec Burks led Golden State with 28 points. Eric Paschall had 19 points, and Glenn Robinson III added 15 points and 11 rebounds. The rookie Paschall was challenged with guarding Harden for much of the game. ""It's just hard because he's so dynamic and he's a great passer,"" Paschall said. ""And during his (isolation plays), you can't really touch him because he's so smart on how he draws the fouls. As a team, we did a good job in the first half, but then he got hot and started hitting 3s."" Already reeling from injuries to Splash Brothers Stephen Curry (broken hand) and Klay Thompson (knee surgery) and the loss of Kevin Durant, the Warriors were without D'Angelo Russell (sprained right ankle) and Draymond Green (torn ligament in left index finger) for a third straight game. Russell, who sat on the Golden State bench, could return Friday, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Golden State fell to 2-6 for the first time in eight years. Both teams struggled with their shooting for spurts of the first half, but late in the second quarter, Harden drilled a deep 3-pointer where he was also fouled. That shot fired up both Harden and the Toyota Center crowd, including rapper Travis Scott, who was sitting courtside. Houston led 63-52 at the half, thanks in large part to Harden's 24 first-half points, but also Golden State's 38.8% shooting from the field. There were seven lead changes in the first half before Houston started to pull away. To open up the second half, the Rockets held the Warriors to just three field goals in the first seven minutes of the third quarter and built a lead as large as 23 points. They entered the fourth quarter leading 98-83. ""I didn't like our shot selection as a team tonight,"" Kerr said. ""I didn't think we played for each other. I thought we were driving to try to score instead of driving to try to score instead of driving to try to move the ball to someone on the team who can make the next play."" TIP-INS Warriors: C Kevon Looney will likely miss at least the next two weeks with a nerve condition that has kept him out the last six games, the Warriors said. Looney missed the entire preseason with a strained right hamstring and exited the second half of the season opener with tightness in the hamstring. Rockets: SG Eric Gordon missed Wednesday night's game with a sore hamstring injury he suffered in Monday night's win in Memphis. Gordon is likely day-to-day, and coach Mike D'Antoni said he's hopeful Gordon can return Saturday night when the Rockets visit Chicago. SAME BUILDING, NEW FACES ""It is strange. We were in this building not too long ago with a huge game. We're entirely different. I don't think we have a single player from that night that's going to play tonight. Houston is different, too, with the trade with Chris (Paul) for Russell (Westbrook). Everything's very different. It's early in the season, and everybody is trying to figure out what's what."" -- Warriors coach Steve Kerr on playing at the Toyota Center less than six months removed from a series-winning Game 6 victory in the Western Conference semifinals. SHAPING UP D'Antoni said some of Houston's early struggles have been related to issues with conditioning. He took part of the blame for saving his players' legs in the preseason and limiting practices but said he believes the shooting, the energy and the defense will improve once the conditioning comes around. Harden said the conditioning is a work in progress. ""We're getting there game by game. We don't really practice a lot, we're a vet team. (D'Antoni) leaves it up to us to go out there and compete at a high level. We work on our condition in that way. Individually, we have to make sure we're on that, and as a team, we have to make sure we're on that."" HOT HOUSE Rockets SF Danuel House Jr. had a season-high 17 points while shooting 5 of 6 from 3-point range. House has scored 15 or more points in four of the past five games. The Rockets are 12-3 when House scores 15 or more points.","401160749"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies finally held onto a fourth-quarter lead thanks to the play of their starting guards. Dillon Brooks scored 31 points, rookie Ja Morant added 26 and the Grizzlies beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 137-121 on Wednesday night. The fourth-quarter play of the two guards sealed the game with Brooks scoring 16 points in the period and Morant adding 14, The pair combined to shoot 11 of 17 in the quarter. ""It was a good way to end the game,"" Brooks said. ""We put it in Ja's hands and he knew how to finish the game."" But it was Brooks who put the game away, scoring all 10 Memphis points in a 10-2 burst near the midway point of the fourth. Rookie Brandon Clarke made all seven of his shots and scored 18 points, while Jae Crowder also had 18 points for Memphis. The Grizzlies snapped a three-game losing streak. The game featured two of the league's fastest teams in pace, leading to rapid changing ends of the court. The Grizzlies were able to record 26 fast-break points compared to 13 for Minnesota. Memphis would end the night shooting a season-best 57%, including connecting on 12 of 23 3-pointers. The 137 points was the second-highest scoring game in franchise history -- quite the change from the grit and grind era where Memphis was annually among the slowest-pace teams in the league. ""It was mostly the transition defense, but our halfcourt defense wasn't that good either,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 30 points. Karl-Anthony Towns returned from a two-game suspension for a confrontation with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid to finish with 25 points and 13 rebounds. ""It came down to getting stops,"" Wiggins said. ""We couldn't get any stops. They had some guys who kept making plays."" For Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins, the victory -- the Grizzlies' second of a season -- is an example of the continued work needed for his young team to improve. And he is noticing strides in the right direction. ""You've got to be able to do this night-in and night-out,"" Jenkins said. ""Minnesota still scored a bunch of points.

"DALLAS --  Twice in the final minute with a one-point lead, the Dallas Mavericks committed a turnover, including the last of their 17 miscues on a bad pass from young triple-double phenom Luka Doncic with 10 seconds left. And twice in the final minute, the Mavericks drew a charge on Aaron Gordon, only to give the Orlando Magic one more chance to win when Seth Curry missed two free throws. Nikola Vucevic missed an open 3-pointer just before the buzzer after the two calls against Gordon and Curry's misfires, Doncic scored 27 points and the Mavericks held on for a 107-106 victory Wednesday night. ""They saved me,"" Doncic said of the Dallas D after finishing with seven rebounds and seven assists while chasing a third straight triple-double for the first time in the reigning rookie of the year's career. ""I didn't do the right play on the offense. They saved me on the defense."" The first call against Gordon came with 34 seconds to go on a drive in the lane against Dorian Finney-Smith, who used to be the primary defensive specialist for the Mavericks before they added Delon Wright in the offseason. Just three seconds after Doncic's turnover, Gordon got his sixth foul for pushing off against Tim Hardaway Jr. at the 3-point line. The Magic finally executed what they wanted on offense after Curry's misses, but Vucevic's shot from just right of the key bounced off the rim. ""It's two plays down the stretch,"" said Gordon, who led Orlando with 23 points but scored just two after halftime as the Magic dropped their fourth straight game in the 10th consecutive loss for the road team in this series. ""One, I like the way I was being aggressive. The other one, I could have made a better decision. We still got a good shot at the end. It's what we wanted but executing down the stretch there's a couple of things we could have done better for sure."" Vucevic had 19 points and 11 rebounds, while Jonathan Isaac finished with 13 points and 10 boards. J.J. Barea, a 13-year veteran with a history of bringing energy off the bench for the Mavericks, made his season debut in the second quarter and had 11 straight Dallas points -- all of his scoring -- while Doncic and fellow Euro star Kristaps Porzingis were struggling. Three consecutive 3-pointers from Barea helped Dallas get within two at halftime (56-54) after trailing by 10 in the first half. He was considered healthy when the season started but didn't play the first six games after an Achilles injury limited him to 38 games last season. ""I was playing with my kids and my dog in my house, doing all type of stuff,"" Barea said. ""But I felt good out there. I think it's the longer I waited, the better it gets. So I'm not mad about it."" Porzingis scored 10 points on 4-of-14 shooting with eight rebounds. Maxi Kleber scored 14, and Dwight Powell added 12. Doncic was 1 of 7 from 3, with the only make in the fourth quarter. Porzingis was 1 of 5 from beyond the arc. TIP-INS Magic: Scored 100 points for the first time this season. ... Steve Clifford coached his 500th game. His record is 240-260. It's Clifford's second season in Orlando after five with Charlotte. ... Carter-Williams didn't attempt another 3 but finished with 13 points along with D.J. Augustin. ... Vucevic matched Doncic for the game high with seven assists. Mavericks: Doncic has scored at least 25 points in six of seven games this season. ... Justin Jackson scored a season-high 11 points, including a layup on a nifty bounce pass in transition from Hardaway to cap a 15-3 run in the third quarter. Dallas erased Orlando's biggest lead of the game (11 points) for a 75-74 lead. EFFICIENT HARDAWAY Hardaway capped a plus-15 showing with his play on Gordon in the final seconds. He scored 13 points. ""I saw him going full speed,"" Hardaway said of Gordon. ""I saw when he was dribbling, he had his left hand out. I just wanted to make sure I got into him enough to make him extend his arm. And once he extended the arm, they have to call that. That's one of the rules that they put in this year."" SHAKY START FROM 3 Orlando, second-to-last in the NBA at 27 percent from 3-point range coming in, missed all seven 3s in the first quarter, capped by Michael Carter-Williams' air ball while wide open in the corner in the final seconds of the first. Gordon was 9 of 11 from the field before halftime, including the only 3 before the break for the Magic, who finished 6 of 24 (25 percent) from long range.","401160751"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Rebounding became a primary focus for the Utah Jazz after they struggled on the boards in two straight losses. It turned into an area of strength against the Philadelphia 76ers. Donovan Mitchell had 24 points and eight assists as the Jazz beat Philadelphia 106-104 on Wednesday night thanks in large part to their effort on the glass. Utah had a 50-42 edge in rebounds over the Sixers, who were sixth in the NBA in rebounding through their first six games. ""We had great urgency on the boards,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Obviously, it was something that our guys internalized. We watched film. Those are boxes you're checking and our guys came to rebound."" Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points, 16 rebounds and three steals. Joe Ingles scored a season-high 16 off the bench for Utah. The Jazz improved to 4-0 at home this season after holding the 76ers to one field goal over the final four minutes. ""We've had great stretches of defense throughout the entire year,"" Mitchell said. ""We've defended really well and this was another night of it, but we've got to keep going."" Joel Embiid had 27 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Sixers, who have dropped two consecutive games after a 5-0 start that made them the last unbeaten team in the NBA. Josh Richardson added a season-high 24 points and Tobias Harris chipped in with 16. Ben Simmons did not play in the second half because of right shoulder soreness after bumping into Royce O'Neale's chest while posting up on a first-quarter play. Simmons finished with two points and two assists in 10 minutes. Not having their point guard on the floor altered what the Sixers were able to do in terms of containing Utah's top playmakers. ""Defense is where we felt the pain of not having him the most,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. The Sixers built a 44-36 early in the second quarter after Embiid scored on three straight possessions, capped by a step-back jumper. Utah chipped away at the deficit behind Bogdanovic, who scored 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting in the period. The Jazz finally went ahead 55-51 when Bogdanovic knocked down a pair of shots and fed Gobert for an alley-oop dunk over three straight possessions. Utah took control in the third behind hot shooting from Mitchell. He scored back-to-back baskets to spark a 12-2 run that gave the Jazz a 78-65 lead late in the quarter. Mitchell totaled four field goals and assisted on two others during the period. Embiid hit four free throws over consecutive possessions to help trim Utah's lead to 103-101 with 1:51 left. Bogdanovic drained a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession to keep Philadelphia from taking the lead. It ended up being the only 3 the Jazz made during the quarter. BACK IN ACTION Embiid returned after serving a two-game suspension for fighting with Minnesota center Karl-Anthony Towns and logged his third double-double of the season. Embiid also brought back a contrite attitude on how his actions and absence affected the Sixers. ""Getting suspended is not great for me, or for the team, so it's never going to happen again,"" he said. FREE THROW PARADE Philadelphia shot 30 of 34 from the free throw line. Embiid led the way, going 16 of 18. Utah was 16 for 24 at the line. Snyder acknowledged his team's aggressiveness on the boards resulted in the fouls piling up. ""They're talented offensive players,"" he said. ""They put you in difficult positions where you can foul and it's hard not to. I wish we could have been a little better keeping them off the line."" FINDING A GROOVE Mike Conley's early shooting struggles are fading away. Conley is shooting 43.6% from the floor over his last four games after finishing with 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting against the Sixers. It's a big step forward after he hit just 20% from the field over his first four games with the Jazz. ""I thought I had a good flow throughout the whole game, just knowing when my time was to be aggressive and when I was to be a decoy or cutting or whatever it was,"" Conley said. ""I'm just trying to figure out where my timing is and I think tonight was a good step."" TIP-INS 76ers: Richardson had his first 20-point game of the season. ... Brown was whistled for a technical foul in the third quarter. ... Raul Neto spent his first four NBA seasons with the Jazz. Neto finished with 11 points and a team-high four assists during his first game back in Utah after signing with the Sixers over the summer. Jazz: Mitchell made his first four shots and scored 10 points in the opening quarter. ... Gobert was whistled for a flagrant 1 foul in the third after swinging his arm out and hitting Richardson in the face. ...

"Before the Bucks-Clippers game, Paul George is seen draining 3-pointers. (0:17) LOS ANGELES --  The numbers are adding up quickly for Giannis Antetokounmpo. The reigning NBA MVP had 38 points and 16 rebounds to help the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 129-124 on Wednesday night for their fourth victory in a row. It's what he's done to start the season that really stands out. Antetokounmpo became the first player in league history with 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in the first eight games of a season. ""He played the whole fourth quarter and was fabulous,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Antetokounmpo had 13 points in 12 minutes during the fourth as Milwaukee repelled several threats by the Clippers, who kept getting within four only to come up short. ""Guys were physical with me but at the end of the day you've just got to keep doing what you're doing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I was trying to make plays, try to stay aggressive. That's what my teammates wanted me to do."" Antetokounmpo just missed a triple-double with nine assists. He's posted at least 10 rebounds and five assists in each of the first eight games this season, the first player to do that since at least 1972-73. ""He's a beast,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. George Hill scored 24 points off the bench and hit six of the Bucks' 18 3-pointers. The Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard, who rested for the first half of a home back-to-back. He'll play against Portland on Thursday night. ""When he sits out we've just got to step up,"" said Lou Williams, who had 34 points and 11 assists. Montrezl Harrell had a career-high 34 points and 13 rebounds in his first start of the season. ""It don't mean nothing,"" he said in a low voice. ""We lost."" Patrick Beverley added 20 points and 10 rebounds in the Clippers' first home defeat. Led by Hill and Kyle Korver with 14 points, the Bucks' reserves outscored the Clippers' bench 47-20, the first time that's happened to Los Angeles this season. Harrell and Williams being in the starting lineup reduced much of the bench production. Los Angeles starter Landry Shamet had just two points coming into the fourth, but made four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points. The last one put the Clippers within two with 23 seconds left. ""If we came up with one or two more stops, the game might have been different,"" Harrell said. The Bucks finished it off at the free throw line, and the Clippers couldn't connect on multiple chances during their last possession. ""They had us on our heels the whole game,"" Williams said. ""We just weren't as sharp as we'd like to be."" The Clippers closed within four early in the fourth, but Antetokounmpo reeled off seven straight points to keep the Bucks ahead 115-103. ""I just know he's always around the rim,"" former Clippers guard Eric Bledsoe said of Antetokounmpo. ""Even though it's a bad play or whatnot, he's going to be under the rim, so I just find a way to get it to him."" Bledsoe added 20 points, and Brook Lopez had 11 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks. The Clippers erased an 11-point deficit in the third. They forced three ties, but each time Antetokounmpo answered for the Bucks. He dunked, hit a 3-pointer and made two free throws. Milwaukee outscored the Clippers 15-6 to take a 98-89 lead into the fourth. The Bucks opened the second on a 30-11 run, hitting five 3-pointers, for their largest lead of 17 points. Hill scored 14 to help the Bucks lead 70-59 at halftime. They closed with three consecutive 3s, two by Hill and the last by Korver, who beat the buzzer. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo had two airballs: the first on a jumper to end the first quarter and the second on a free throw in the third. ... For the first time in three games, the Bucks didn't lead all the way -- but they came close. The Clippers' only lead was by three points. Clippers: Starting F Patrick Patterson had just two points. ... Rivers remained stuck on 899 career wins. FROM LONG RANGE The Bucks took 49 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo tied his career high with four, the same number Bledsoe and Korver made. ""It makes a big difference,"" Budenholzer said. ""We hopefully can open up the court and it gives different guys driving lanes. We want to keep shooting them."" OUCH! Budenholzer said Hill got popped in the eye but is expected to be fine.","401160753"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  As he peered up at the videoboard suspended above the court, Kemba Walker broke into a wide smile and tears trickled down his cheeks. The Hornets honored their all-time leading scorer with a highlight video Thursday night, giving the Boston Celtics point guard a hero's welcome in his return to Charlotte. As the tribute ended, the crowd erupted with a loud, one-minute standing ovation. ""It was special,"" Walker said. ""Just to be back here and the amount of love I have been getting today and leading up to this day. The video just topped it off. It made me really emotional. I was trying to hold it in, but I couldn't. I knew I wasn't going to be able to."" Jayson Tatum scored 23 points, and Walker got what he ultimately wanted -- a victory -- in his homecoming game as the Celtics soundly defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 108-87. It was an underwhelming performance by Walker's standards. The three-time All-Star who once scored 60 points on this court was held to 14 on 4-of-12 shooting, and didn't make his first field goal until three minutes into the third quarter. Walker said the video didn't impact his play on the court, but coach Brad Stevens believed it contributed. ""Yeah, it's really hard,"" Stevens said. ""He had the right idea coming into the game but you knew right after they played that video, that probably was going to be a tough start. That was really cool and a great tribute by the Hornets. I know how much he appreciated it."" Walked played eight seasons in Charlotte before signing with the Celtics after Hornets owner Michael Jordan elected not to give Walker a five-year, $221 million supermax contract. But he left on good terms with the organization and its fans. After the game, Walker stayed on the court hugging members of the organization, including some of the ushers. ""It's always great to see Kemba,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""I love that guy. He has a great spirit. He's a great competitor and a wonderful person. I think it was a good night for him and for all of us. Both teams have moved on, but it's always good to see him."" Gordon Hayward added 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who scored 17 points off 21 Charlotte turnovers. Miles Bridges had 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Hornets, who had their three-game win streak snapped. Charlotte was just 6 of 31 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said center Enes Kanter is improving from a bruised left knee, but isn't quite ready to return. Hornets: Bridges received a technical after mixing it up with Marcus Smart in the fourth quarter. ... The Hornets had nine blocks. SMART MOVE Smart was upset after picking up his fifth foul and clapped in disgust in the direction of the Celtics bench after a couple of coaches appeared to be yelling at him on the court. Stevens said Smart's actions didn't bother him at all. ""This is the part about Marcus that I love -- his fire, his competitiveness,"" Stevens said. ""If there's a moment when he's upset with us, that's all part of it, we move on pretty quickly. We've been together a long time and I've been yelled at before and that's OK. I love him and I trust him and he'll get every opportunity."" ROZIER STRUGGLES Terry Rozier, signed by the Hornets to replace Walker, was hoping for a big game against his former team but struggled all night and was held to three points after shooting 1 of 11 from the field. ""He tried to play the right way but shots weren't falling,"" Borrego said. ""He competed tonight and he just has to stick with it. It's an emotional game. It's always an interesting game. I think Kemba felt the same way in the first half. I think Kemba was 0 for 6 in the first half and I think Terry was 0 for 6."" WILLIAMS' RETURN Celtics rookie Grant Williams grew up about six minutes from the Spectrum Center -- and reminded his teammates of that on the way into Charlotte. ""When we were on the bus I was annoying because I was calling out interstates and talking about buildings like I'm a tour guide and everyone was telling me to shut up because it was 1 a.m.,"" Williams said with a laugh.","401160754"
"SAN ANTONIO -- Dejounte Murray had been making himself miserable in the film room. Watching turnover after turnover, he promised Spurs teammate LaMarcus Aldridge things were going to change against Oklahoma City on Thursday night. Aldridge was the benefactor of Murray's improved play at point guard, scoring a season-high 39 points to help San Antonio roll over the Thunder 121-112. ""I tell him every day, you're too great of a player to just go missing in action,"" Murray said. ""It's on me being a point guard and the rest of the team. We've got to make sure a guy like that is well involved early from the jump."" Murray had a career-high 10 assists along with 17 points and 8 rebounds. The 22-year-old played 26 minutes as San Antonio continues to restrict his play after he missed last season following right knee surgery. Murray, who was averaging 3.0 turnovers per game, had seven turnovers in back-to-back losses entering Thursday's game. ""I've got to stop being sloppy,"" Murray said. The Spurs had a season-high 32 assists in snapping their two-game skid. DeMar DeRozan added 16 points and nine assists for the Spurs. Danilo Gallinari scored 27 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 21 for the Thunder, who entered the game on a two-game winning streak. ""We were hanging around there, we just couldn't get enough stops,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. Aldridge finished 19-for-23 from the field and made 10 consecutive shots bridging the first and second halves. ""LaMarcus was a beast, his rhythm was really good,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He shot quickly, he made quick decisions and he also passed it out of there when he got doubled or there was a crowd. He did a great job of finding other people. He played a really smart game offensively."" Aldridge had a combined 22 points and shot 8-for-23 during the Spurs' two-game skid but made a 21-foot jumper against the Thunder to open the game. ""I definitely put the work in,"" Aldridge said. ""Just waiting for my shot to come back. The first one felt good, after that I just tried to stay with it."" Chris Paul had 19 points and five assists in 31 minutes. TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City's most recent win in San Antonio was Dec. 25, 2014. Russell Westbrook had 34 points and 11 assists in the 114-106 victory. ... Mike Muscala played one minute.

San Antonio set a season high with 33 points in the opening quarter. BIG THREE TO BIG BRO Spurs assistant coach Tim Duncan is mentoring Murray just as he once did for another Spurs point guard, Tony Parker. ""That's a big bro for me for sure,"" Murray said. ""As far as right now, he's coach, Coach Tim. Man, the knowledge he has, just everything around. He's always there trying to help me in everything, whether it's in the gym or [watching] film.

"PHOENIX --  Goran Dragic was an All-Star just two seasons ago. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra hasn't forgotten. The 12-year veteran might come off the bench for the Heat these days, but he's still capable of putting up big numbers and making big baskets. That was on full display Thursday night, when Dragic scored 20 of his 25 points in the second half to push the Miami Heat past the Phoenix Suns 124-108. ""It's a great luxury for us to bring an All-Star talent, in his prime still, off the bench,"" Spoelstra said. ""I don't take for that granted. And I'm going to make sure the team doesn't take that for granted."" Jimmy Butler scored 34 points and Dragic had the big second half to help Miami win for the fourth time in five games and bounce back from a 20-point loss to Denver on Tuesday. The Heat improved to 6-2 for the first time since 2012 when they had LeBron James and eventually won the NBA title. Butler had 18 points by the end of the first quarter and 30 at halftime as the Heat built a 64-57 lead. Miami shot 53.5 percent in the first half, hitting 7 of 14 from 3-point range. ""That guy's special,"" Spoelstra said. ""He really is. He set the tone for the game obviously in that first half. We just played off of his offensive force. Really smart basketball, getting to the rim, getting his open looks."" Dragic, who played six seasons early in his career with the Suns, hit a 3-pointer just before the buzzer at the end of the third quarter to put the Heat up 93-86. ""If you ask any player, when you play against your former team, it's extra motivation,"" Dragic said. ""It's always nice to win here."" Phoenix had its three-game winning streak snapped. Aron Baynes led the Suns with 23 points and Devin Booker added 22. Ricky Rubio had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Coach Monty Williams said his team's ball movement wasn't very good. ""We just didn't have it tonight and that happens,"" Williams said. ""I think it will be a great learning lesson for us."" HERRO BALL Miami rookie Tyler Herro had another solid game with 15 points on 6 of 12 shooting, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Spoelstra said Herro had some defensive breakdowns, but he's always competitive on the court. The coach said Herro wanted to guard Booker during the second half and the results were mixed. ""You gotta like the kid's guts, for better or worse,"" Spoelstra said. TOUGH SCHEDULE Miami has a tough turnaround with a road game against LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers in less than 24 hours on Friday night. ""No excuses,"" Dragic said. ""We'll go there and play hard and try to get a win. It's always fun to play against the best teams in the league. That's why we're here."" THE HOMESTAND CONTINUES Phoenix is now 1-1 on its six-game homestand. The Suns will face the Nets on Sunday and then have games against the Lakers, Hawks and Celtics. The Suns trailed for almost the entire game against the Heat. They fought within two points at multiple points late in the third quarter, but Dragic's big shooting night ended any hope for a win. ""We just have to bring it every night,"" Booker said. ""Give credit to them. They came out playing high energy, playing real physical from the start and that directly translates to the product that happened on the court."" TIP-INS Phoenix: Rookie guard Ty Jerome missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers were kings of the fourth quarter. Portland star Damian Lillard lost his crown, at least for a night anyway. Lou Williams made a go-ahead jumper with 58 seconds left, then added a 3-pointer and finished with 26 points to lift Los Angeles over the Trail Blazers 107-101 on Thursday for coach Doc Rivers' 900th career victory. ""Doc never stops going and grinding,"" Kawhi Leonard said. ""He never gets bored."" Lillard and CJ McCollum led Portland with 22 points apiece, but surprisingly both got blanked in the fourth quarter. That's usually Lillard's time to shine, but the Clippers' defense wasn't having it. ""Usually I can make those shots down the stretch, but they weren't falling,"" Lillard said. ""They were coming out to guard me and picking up full court. Pat Beverley did a good job on defense."" Lillard missed four shots and went 0 for 3 from 3-point range, while McCollum also missed four shots. ""It's the third game that we've won, in my opinion, completely because of our defense,"" Rivers said. ""Our offense was below average. If you can win a game and not play well offensively, that says a lot about your team."" Leonard had 27 points, 13 rebounds and six turnovers after missing a nationally televised loss to Milwaukee the previous night as part of load management for his knee. ""Over the last six minutes of the game, we got stops, got rebounds and made our free throws. Lou also made a big 3 for us,"" Leonard said. ""We played good defense and stuck in there the whole game and we stayed positive. It was a grind-out win for us."" Leonard and Williams combined to score the Clippers' final 15 points. Leonard sealed the win with four straight free throws as fans chanted ""MVP! MVP!"" ""The Lou-him combination was lethal down the stretch,"" Rivers said. With Lillard and McCollum getting shut down, Anfernee Simons scored 16 of his 17 points in the fourth, including Portland's first 12 of the quarter. The Clippers rallied from eight points down early in the period, taking their first lead on Leonard's basket. The Blazers tied it 98-all on a three-point play by Hassan Whiteside. Williams' jumper put the Clippers ahead for good and he followed it up with a 3 -- one of just four made by the Clippers in the game. ""I felt if I had an inch, I'd go for the kill,"" Williams said. The Blazers regained the lead in the third, outscoring the Clippers 36-23. Portland tied it 61-all on McCollum's 3-pointer, spurring an 18-7 run that sent the Blazers into the fourth leading 76-70. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum received a flagrant-1 foul late in the second quarter after his right foot hit Patrick Patterson in the face on a fadeaway jumper. Patterson landed near the LA bench. ""Surprised the foot made it up that high,"" said the 6-foot-8 Patterson. McCollum is 6-3. ""I was playing full speed and I ran into him on the baseline,"" McCollum said. ""I didn't do it on purpose."" ... Portland's 40 points in the first half were its fewest in a half this season. Clippers: Improved to 5-1 at home. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS --  A next-man-up mentality is keeping the Indiana Pacers competitive despite a rash of injuries. T.J. McConnell was the key for the Pacers on Friday night in a 112-106 win over the Pistons that moved Indiana above .500 for the first time this season. Playing all but two minutes of the fourth quarter, McConnell, the backup point guard, finished with 17 points, nine assists and five rebounds on a night the Pacers played without four members of their rotation. ""We've got to hold down the fort until those guys get back,"" McConnell said. ""I've been a guy the last five years who hasn't tried to go outside the box. I had the lane, and I took it."" All-Star Victor Oladipo, starting center Myles Turner and his backup, Goga Bitadze, and sixth man Jeremy Lamb were out due to injury. Detroit had already beaten the Pacers twice this season. And then the Pacers fell behind by 15 points in the first quarter. None of that fazed Indiana, which ranks in the top half of the league on defense. ""Defense is how we win games,"" said reserve Justin Holiday, who chipped in 16 points and six rebounds. ""That's our identity. We've been playing defense."" That has helped the Pacers go 5-1 since starting the season 0-3. ""Our chemistry is growing,"" said Domantas Sabonis, who finished with 17 points, 14 rebounds and six assists. ""Coach (Nate McMillan) runs a great system that is easy to run, no matter who is on the court."" Luke Kennard had 29 points, six rebounds and five assists, and Andre Drummond finished with 15 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists for Detroit. Drummond had averaged 25 points and 20.5 rebounds in the two wins against the Pacers. They finally found a way Friday to slow the two-time All-Star -- foul trouble. Drummond picked up his third foul near midcourt with 4:31 remaining in the first half and sat the rest of the way. Indiana outscored the Pistons 14-2 in that span and led 57-53 at intermission. ""I told Andre you can't pick up your third foul at half court,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""He wasn't thinking in that situation. Just a bad foul that put us in a tough position, and he knows it. He felt bad about it."" The Pacers then opened the third quarter on an 11-2 run, causing Casey to use a timeout. Shortly after play resumed, two more baskets stretched Indiana's lead to 17, and the Pistons never got closer than six. McConnell, whose point total was one shy of his career high, spearheaded a bench effort that accounted for 51 of the Pacers' points on a night the team shot at least 50% from the field for just the second time this season. ""(McConnell) made the difference,"" Casey said. SCREEN CONFUSION In his pregame media session, Casey expressed a degree of frustration in how the league is officiating screens and pick-and-roll plays. ""It changes every possession, maybe every game, what's legal, not legal,"" Casey said. ""Whether you can stick your butt out, or if you slide to your right, use your hands to push off, all of the above, we have to have some clarification. It's very difficult because those are split-second decisions."" TIP-INS Pistons: Star forward Blake Griffin, starting point guard Reggie Jackson and sixth-man extraordinaire Derrick Rose, averaging 20.8 points and 6.3 assists per game, all sat out due to injury. ... Detroit shot 45% with 17 turnovers. Pacers: Warren was assessed a Flagrant 1 for his offensive foul with 2:15 left in the contest. Making both free throws off the flagrant, the Pistons added a 3-pointer for a rare five-point possession. ... Sabonis added 14 boards and six assists. ... The team's video board showed former NFL quarterback Trent Green in attendance. Green played college football at Indiana in the 1990s. He received a round of applause.","401160758"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Big nights by big men Nikola Vucevic and Jonathan Isaac carried the Orlando Magic to their first runaway victory of the season. Vucevic dominated at the offensive end with 23 points, 16 rebounds and six assists. Isaac had 22 points and eight rebounds, but it was his four blocks and game-long presence around the rim that turned the game in Orlando's favor, as the Magic beat the Memphis Grizzlies 118-86. The Magic outscored the Grizzlies 34-8 in the fourth quarter, limiting the visitors to 3-for-23 shooting (13%) and forcing four turnovers. Isaac was the dominating player at the defensive end. ""He was terrific,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""He's so active with his hands, blocking shots. You can see his confidence growing every time he steps on the floor."" The Grizzlies led the NBA in points in the paint. Orlando controlled that stat Friday. ""We only scored 34 points in the paint and that's a credit to him and their entire team,"" Memphis Coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""His defense, his length, his activity, he was really strong at both ends of the floor."" Evan Fournier scored 19 points and Aaron Gordon added 17 for the Magic, who stopped a four-game losing streak. Orlando, which struggled again with its 3-point shooting again (7 of 28), made up for it by outscoring Memphis 62-34 in the paint. Memphis, which had 137 points in its last game, the second-highest total in franchise history, was held under 100 for the second time this season. Jonas Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with 15 points and nine rebounds. Jaren Jackson had 14 points and Brandon Clarke 13 for the Grizzlies, who lost for the fourth time in five games. ""You can look at the stat sheet and go `OK, 34-8 in the fourth quarter,' "" Jenkins said, ""but we weren't good in the first, second or third either to even give us a chance. We were playing catch-up the whole game."" Orlando started the fourth period on a 13-0 run to get some separation from Memphis. Michael Carter-Williams started the fourth-quarter run with a 3-pointer. D.J. Augustin contributed another and Vucevic finished the spurt with a three-point play to make it 97-78 with 7:49 left. Memphis missed its first nine shots of the fourth quarter and turned the ball over three times. Isaac was in the middle of much of that misery, using his length and quickness to bottle up passing lanes for the Grizzlies' guards and force shooters to rush their stroke. ""His defense has been amazing,"" Vucevic said of his teammate. ""I told him in preseason that he could be a candidate for defensive player of the year if he keeps playing like that. I really believe that. He's taking a lot of pride in trying to stop his guy and helping others as well."" The Magic, who made only one of 12 3-pointers in the first half, got four in the third quarter and jumped out to their biggest lead of the game, 79-66, on a dunk by Gordon with 2:23 left in the period. Memphis cut the deficit to 84-78 by the end of the period, but the Grizzlies night-long struggles against the Magic interior defense continued. The Grizzlies' guards got caught in the air too many times and either forced shots or turned the ball over. TIP INS Grizzlies: Memphis hit just five of 19 shots (26.3%) in the first quarter. ... The Grizzlies lead the NBA in points in the paint (57.7 per game), but had only 34. Magic:  F Terrence Ross missed his second straight game with a sore knee. . Orlando hit just one of 12 3-pointers in the first half. ... The Magic are last in the NBA in scoring at 95.1 points a game, and went over 100 points for just the second time this season. ...

"WASHINGTON --  After four decades as a college coach, John Beilein is eight games into his first NBA season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and on Friday night, he recorded his first win on the road. Tristan Thompson had 21 points and 12 rebounds, Kevin Love added 16 points and 12 boards, and the Cavaliers beat the Washington Wizards 113-100 to end a three-game skid. Seven Cavaliers scored at least 10 points as Cleveland improved to 3-5. ""It's always great to get a road win,"" Beilein said. ""I don't care what type of team you have. They guys needed it. When you win somewhere else, it's always special."" Thomas Bryant led Washington with 23 points. Rui Hachimura scored 21 and Bradley Beal had 20 while the Wizards fell to 2-6. ""We didn't defend,"" Beal said. ""That's what happened."" Collin Sexton also had 16 points for Cleveland, and rookies Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr. had career highs with 15 and 13, respectively. Cleveland led throughout and used an 11-0 run to take a 41-28 lead with 9:19 remaining in the second quarter. The lead grew to 20, but thanks to Hachimura's 15 points on 7 for 7 from the field, Washington cut the lead to 67-52 at the half. Cleveland's 10-0 run put them ahead 77-56 early in the third, but the Wizards outscored them 28-11 and trailed by just 88-84 entering the fourth quarter Washington closed to 91-90 on Moe Wagner's layup with 9:39 to play, but Cleveland outscored Washington 22-10 the rest of the way. Thompson had three key baskets in the last two minutes. Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who was assessed a technical foul for the second straight game, felt the key to the game was Cleveland's attempting 29 free throws to Washington's six. ""It's hard to overcome,"" Brooks said. Brooks wouldn't explicitly criticize the officiating. ""Every time I've complained, they say they have the call right,"" Brooks said. TIP INS Cavaliers: G Jordan Clarkson was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter, but Beal missed the free throw. Wizards: F Troy Brown started for the first time this season. He scored three points in 19 minutes. Isaac Bonga started the first seven games of the season but didn't play Friday. ... G Justin Robinson and F Admiral Schofield were recalled from the G League. ... Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo was introduced to the crowd and got an ovation nine days after his team won the World Series. BACK TO SCHOOL Beilein coached Wagner at Michigan. Wagner, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers last season, said it was ""weird"" playing against his college coach. ""Moe is special to me,"" Beilein said. ""There's no doubt about it. It's hard to play against him. I hoped he missed every shot tonight. The other games are fine."" Wagner had eight points and committed four fouls in 14 minutes. ""I hope I get another chance to go against him,"" Wagner said.","401160760"
"ATLANTA --  Once Bogdan Bogdanovic and the Sacramento Kings starting making 3-pointers, they didn't stop. That's just what coach Luke Walton wants to see. Bogdanovic scored 20 points and hit two of his 3-pointers in a key fourth-quarter flurry and the Sacramento Kings fought off Atlanta's comeback attempt to beat the Hawks 121-109 on Friday night. Sacramento led by 21 points in the second period before Trae Young, who had 30 points, led Atlanta's second-half comeback. The Hawks cut the Kings' lead to one point, 94-93, before Sacramento answered with a string of five 3-pointers, including the two by Bogdanovic. The Kings made 18 of 31 3-pointers for the game. ""We have really good shooters on our team,"" Walton said. ""We know that. ... When our guys are open we want them letting it fly."" Buddy Hield led the Kings with 22 points. De'Aaron Fox had 17 with nine assists. Young scored 16 points in the third quarter, when the Hawks whittled away at the Kings' lead. Atlanta's comeback carried into the fourth quarter. Young's steal set up a layup by Cam Reddish, leaving Sacramento's lead one point. Bogdanovic then sparked the Kings' flurry of 3-pointers that ended Atlanta's comeback. ""I think we had to fight too much to get back in the game, and that's something we've got to get better at,"" Young said. After opening the season with five straight losses, the Kings have won three of four. Hield said strong shooting has led the recovery. ""Guys are shooting the ball and making shots at a high clip,"" Hield said. Sacramento led 63-47 at halftime. The Kings' big first-half lead was 21 points, 59-38. Young had only eight points in the first half but scored Atlanta's first three baskets after the break. ""I was mad at the way I played,"" Young said of his quiet first half. ""I wanted to come out and make a difference."" Jabari Parker had 25 points and eight rebounds for Atlanta. Young's 3-pointer trimmed the Kings' lead to 68-54.

Parker has scored in double figures in seven of eight games. SOONERS REUNION In the matchup of high-scoring former Oklahoma standouts, Hield scored 11 points in the third quarter. That helped the Kings overcome Young's hot streak. It also helped prevent Young from finally winning a matchup against his former teammate. ""Obviously I know Buddy,"" Young said. ""... I always try to win when I go up against him. I haven't done it yet."" HOT SHOOTING The Kings built their big first-half lead on 63.4% shooting (26 of 41) from the field.

"MINNEAPOLIS -- Andrew Wiggins scored 40 points, hitting the tying basket late in regulation, and the Minnesota Timberwolves overcame D'Angelo Russell's career-high 52 points to beat the Golden State Warriors 125-119 in overtime Friday night. Russell and the Warriors led 110-106 with 29 seconds left in regulation. But after two free throws by Karl-Anthony Towns and a forced jump ball by Robert Covington, Wiggins tied it on a drive with 5.6 seconds left. Russell's 3-pointer at the buzzer missed. In overtime, Wiggins hit a clinching 3 with 23 seconds left to help the Timberwolves snap a two-game losing streak. Towns battled through foul trouble to score 20 points and grab 14 rebounds. Covington had 17 points and 11 rebounds. Alec Burks scored 18 points off the bench for the Warriors. They have lost five of six. Russell had missed the previous three games for injury-depleted Golden State with a sprained right ankle. His return gave the Warriors their seventh different starting lineup in nine games. His previous career high was 44 points. Three fouls limited Towns to seven points on five shots in 10 first-half minutes. That, along with 17 points from Russell, helped the Warriors to a 61-60 lead at halftime. Golden State was 20-for-20 from the free-throw line in the first half. The Warriors finished the game 23 for 24. TIP INS Warriors G Stephen Curry (fractured left wrist), G Klay Thompson (left ACL surgery), F Kevon Looney (neuropathy), F Draymond Green (sprained left index finger) and F Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) are out. Timberwolves point guards Jeff Teague (illness) and Shabazz Napier (right shoulder sprain) missed their second consecutive game.

"NEW ORLEANS --  The Toronto Raptors tried to balance celebrating an impressive performance by Pascal Siakam and concern over injuries to two of their top players. Siakam matched a career high with 44 points in the Raptors' 122-104 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. As Siakam drained shots, Toronto's medical staff was evaluating injuries to starting point guard Kyle Lowry and sixth-man Serge Ibaka. Lowry suffered a fractured left thumb and Ibaka has a severely sprained ankle. That means the defending NBA Champions will likely be depleted -- at least in the immediate future. But, Siakam showed again Friday he can lead the Raptors to victories as his 44 points matched the career high from a game against the Washington Wizards on Feb. 13. The NBA's Most Improved Player last season scored 16 in the first quarter Friday, and finished 17 of 28 from the floor. He also had 10 rebounds. Siakam attempted a career-high 10 3-pointers, making five. The confident deep shooting is just another sign of his continued growth. ""He's got the green light to make any move he wants at this point,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""No, I'm serious man. We're just trying to get him to see how far he can go here. Drive it, post it, shoot the three, drive it in transition, play pick and roll; we want him to get as many reps as he can."" The 6-foot-9 Siakam briefly ran the Toronto offense to start the fourth quarter with Lowry out and Fred VanVleet resting. Siakam said a rare opportunity to play point guard was an opportunity to work on his ball-handling and overall game. ""I'm just trying to continue to improve, continue to get better and just do what I do- just be myself,"" he said. Toronto used a 45-point second quarter to take control of the game and improved to 6-2. The Pelicans slipped to 1-7. Brandon Ingram led the Pelicans with 27 points. He made just 10 of 25 field goals. Jrue Holiday added 16 points, six rebounds and six assists for New Orleans. The Pelicans kept pace early and the first quarter ended in a 30-30 tie. But the Raptors scored the first 15 points of the second quarter. Toronto parlayed the hot start into a 45-point quarter and a 75-53 halftime lead. In the lopsided first half, the Raptors made 13 of 23 3-pointers (57 and outscored the Pelicans 31-9 on fast-break points. In the game, Toronto shot better from behind the arc (19 of 43, 44.2%) than on two pointers (22 of 50, 44%). Even with Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard leaving in free agency, the Raptors have so far looked like a legitimate contender in the Eastern Conference, and Siakam's continued emergence is a key reason for Toronto's impressive start. ""He's evolving into a superstar,"" Lowry said of Siakam. INJURY DETAILS Lowry said he suffered his thumb injury in the first quarter when he tried to swipe the ball away from Pelicans center Derrick Favors on an offensive rebound. ""It felt weird from the rip,"" Lowry said. ""I kept playing through it and kept playing through it. Originally, we thought it was something in the nail bed because the nail bed turned black and blue. We got some X-rays and we sent the X-rays off to the doctors, and there was a small fracture in the thumb."" Lowry said Friday's injury is unrelated to the surgery he had in July to repair ligaments in the same thumb. Lowry went to the bench after the initial injury, but he returned a couple minutes later. He even made two 3-pointers in the second quarter before subbing out midway through the quarter and retreating to the locker room. Ibaka, who was in a walking boot after the game, suffered his ankle sprain when he contested an Ingram layup with about 1 minute remaining in the second quarter. Ibaka lay on the floor, writhing in pain as play continued, before a Toronto foul allowed two teammates to help him limp off the floor. DEFENSIVE WOES Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry bemoaned his team's defense again after the game. Through eight games, New Orleans has allowed a 40-point quarter and a 70-point half three times. ""Those are hard to survive in this league,"" Gentry said. ""That's where they got the separation, and then once again you're playing uphill the rest of the game and it doesn't matter what kind of run you make."" New Orleans entered Friday allowing a league-worst 124.3 points per game, and after another ugly defensive performance, he hinted there could soon be lineup changes. ""The people we have out there, if they can't do what we're expecting them to do, then the next thing for us to do is that we've got to try to find somebody else,"" he said. TIP-INS Raptors: Norman Powell scored 18 points off the bench. Pelicans: New Orleans shot a season-worst 40.4% from the field. ... Guard Frank Jackson scored 13 points off the bench. Rookie and Toronto native Nickel Alexander-Walker added 13 points. ... Starting point guard Lonzo Ball did not play in the fourth quarter after a rough night that included four turnovers, a season-low two assists and 2-of-8 shooting (5 points).","401160763"
"Prior to his first game against his former team, Kristaps Porzingis says he has ""nothing but love"" for Knicks fans but that he won't dwell on the past. (0:54) DALLAS --  Kristaps Porzingis made his first shot on a 3-pointer and later drove for a tying finger-roll layup that probably reminded the New York Knicks why the 7-foot-3 Latvian with unique offensive skills was once the future of their franchise. The Knicks ended up with the most important thing in their first meeting with their former star: the win, just their second in nine games this season. Marcus Morris scored a season-high 29 points, and New York overcame a career-high 38 points in another triple-double for 20-year-old phenom Luka Doncic, beating the Dallas Mavericks 106-102 on Friday night. Porzingis, who scored 28 points, injured his left knee in his last game with the Knicks on Feb. 6, 2018. He didn't play again until making his Dallas debut this season when the Mavericks decided he wouldn't play last season following the blockbuster trade in January. Almost exactly 21 months since that game, Porzingis played with a purpose early and helped erase a 12-point deficit in the second half, finishing 4 of 8 from 3-point range with nine rebounds and five blocks coming off perhaps his worst showing with the Mavericks. ""Out of all these games, I was probably the most relaxed out there,"" Porzingis said. ""I just wanted to play well and tonight I took a step forward. Whoever it is, I just want to help this team win games."" With the score tied at 92, Porzingis shot an air ball from 3, and the Knicks soon went on a 9-0 run. Morris, a free-agent addition in the offseason, started it with three free throws after Porzingis committed his fifth foul on a 3-pointer. Julius Randle, who grew up in the Dallas area and finished with 21 points, capped it with a jumper. ""I could see how guys would approach it a little extra,"" Morris said of the Knicks playing Porzingis. ""But for me, I've been traded a few times, left some teams with bad tastes in their mouths, so I understand how it goes. It's not about him. It's about us."" Dallas was still within four when rookie R.J. Barrett missed two free throws, but Randle easily beat Porzingis to the rebound and made both free throws after drawing the sixth foul on the centerpiece of a blockbuster deal last January. Doncic had 14 rebounds and 10 assists but also eight turnovers, one shy of the most of the reigning rookie of the year's career. He had a chance to tie after Taj Gibson missed two free throws with 25 seconds left, but pulled up for a 34-footer that bounced off the rim. ""I made a bad decision,"" Doncic said. ""That wasn't the shot I was looking for. I let my team down again. I got to make better choices."" The Mavericks didn't get much help outside their new European pair. Tim Hardaway Jr., who also came to Dallas in the trade, had two late 3-pointers to keep Dallas close, but was just 5 of 15 from the field. He was the only other double-figure scorer for the Mavericks with 14. Barrett, the third overall pick in 2019 after Doncic went with the same choice last year, scored a season-low three points on 1-of-9 shooting. He also missed five of six free throws. ""I wanted my kid to get over that hump tonight so I left him in there to see if he could overcome it,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""He failed this time, but he'll get back on the horse and he'll make his next ones."" TIP-INS Knicks: Bobby Portis had 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Frank Ntilikina had 14 points and four steals. ... The Knicks were 14 of 28 from 3, highlighted by Ntilikina making four of five. Morris was 4 of 8. Mavericks: Doncic made consecutive 3s after starting 1 of 7 from long range, the same finishing total in the previous game against Orlando. He finished 3 of 11. ... After Porzingis, Doncic and Hardaway, the rest of the Mavericks were 8 of 27 from the field. NO SMITH VS. MAVERICKS Dennis Smith Jr., the key piece for New York in the Porzingis trade, missed his sixth straight game after the death of the point guard's stepmother. Smith rejoined the team in Dallas, but coach David Fizdale said Smith was probably another game away from returning. Smith hasn't faced the Mavericks yet, but the teams play again in New York on Thursday. Dallas drafted him ninth overall in 2017, but his future with the Mavericks was clouded by Doncic's arrival as the third overall pick a year later. DUELING CHALLENGES Each coach used his challenge successfully late in the first half, but Rick Carlisle's was a little more important for Dallas because it erased a third foul on Porzingis when he appeared to block Ntilikina's one-handed dunk attempt. The reversal gave Porzingis his second block. Fizdale challenged a charging call against Randle just 1:24 later, with the foul changed to a block on Maxi Kleber. Randle missed both free throws, though.","401160764"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic lofted the winning shot and then pleaded for it to fall as he tumbled to the floor. ""I was hoping,"" he said. ""I mean, you're happy that you didn't miss, because then everybody will be mad at you. The whole arena is going to be disappointed."" Instead, the Denver Nuggets big man sent the fans home with a game they won't soon forget. Jokic hit a 20-foot jumper on a broken play with 1.2 seconds remaining, helping the Nuggets rally from a 21-point, fourth-quarter deficit to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 100-97 on Friday night. It's the largest fourth-quarter comeback in their history, the team said. Jokic scored 16 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, none bigger than his jumper from the left side of the court that he saw go in from the floor. Before his shot, Jokic was trying to get the ball to Paul Millsap, who couldn't get off an attempt. He passed it back to Jokic. On the next possession, Jokic drew an offensive foul on Joel Embiid by fronting him near the basket. It was the sixth foul on a frustrated Embiid. ""I'm kind of heavy. He needs to push a lot just to push me out,"" Jokic cracked. ""I felt he pushed me too strong."" Embiid saw things different after watching the replay. ""If you want to call that foul, especially at that time of the game, it's kind of (expletive), especially because he was hooking me before that foul actually happened,"" Embiid said. A similar feeling for Sixers coach Brett Brown. ""I've just seen the foul that was called on Joel and I have no words,"" Brown said. ""When you see that particular play, I have no words. We give them credit. We weren't able to find a way to win on the road."" Denver hung in there with defense until the offense picked up. Will Barton hit two free throws to seal the win. ""Says a lot about this team, the heart,"" Paul Millsap said. ""We want to have the heart of a champion. That's what champions do, they continue to fight. We were able to get some stops."" Jamal Murray, bloody nose and all, had 22 points for the Nuggets, who've won three straight games since coach Michael Malone called out his team for their energy level. No questioning their energy in this one. Philly hit the first shot of the final quarter to go up 21 and then it was all Denver. The Nuggets didn't take their first lead of the fourth until Jokic's jumper. His 16 points in the final period outscored the Sixers' 13 total points. The matchup in the middle between two of the top centers in the NBA proved highly entertaining. For once, Jokic got the better of Embiid in the stat that mattered most -- wins. Jokic is 1/3 against Embiid when they both play, according to Basketball-Reference. Jokic was first team All-NBA last season, and Embiid second team. A breakdown of the numbers: Jokic had 11 rebounds and six assists. Embiid finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris and Raul Neto each had 13 points for the Sixers, who finished 1/3 on their four-game Western swing. They were without Ben Simmons after he sprained the AC joint in his right shoulder Wednesday in Utah. Neto started in his place. The 7-foot Jokic lost his cool late in the first quarter after not getting a call when he was grabbed while going up for a shot. Jokic held out his hands in exasperation toward official Scott Wall, who ignored him at first and then issued a technical. TIP-INS 76ers: G/F Shake Milton remained out with a left knee bone bruise/sprain. ... Simmons will be evaluated again before Sunday's game against Charlotte. ... G Trey Burke picked up a technical in the second quarter.  ... The Philly bench combined for 37 points, while the Nuggets' reserves had 12. Nuggets: Millsap played with 11 stitches above his right eye after a collision on a fast-break last game. Wearing a headband, he finished with 15 points. SENSE OF HUMOR Malone got to know Embiid through the ""Basketball Without Borders"" program a few years back. Malone was a coach of the African squad. ""I won't get into the stories,"" Malone cracked. ""Joel has a great personality. He has a great sense of humor. I did enjoy my time being around him in a short period of time during that camp.""","401160765"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Bojan Bogdanovic didn't hesitate to ask his new coach for the final shot. With 1.3 seconds left, Utah coach Quin Snyder drew up a play the Jazz practiced earlier Friday, but Bogdanovic said he wanted the ball. ""Mike (Conley) was supposed to be in that corner, but I asked him if he could go to the other,"" Bogdanovic said. Joe Ingles faked a pass to his right and then threw it to Bogdanovic near the left corner -- one of his favorite spots. Ingles raised both his arms before the 3-pointer even settled into the net, and Utah beat the Milwaukee Bucks 103-100. Players ran from the bench and mobbed a smiling Bogdonovic at midcourt. Bogdonovic finished with 33 points. Utah's Donovan Mitchell was driving for a possible winner when George Hill stripped the ball and called timeout with 2.3 seconds left. Milwaukee inbounded to Khris Middleton, but he traveled as Rudy Gobert flew at him. The clock was reset to 1.3 seconds, giving the Jazz one last chance. ""It was big that we could close that out and get that win,"" said Gobert, who missed two free throws and had a late turnover before his defensive heroics. ""If we lose that game at the end after all that, it would have really hurt."" Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 28 of his 30 points in the second half, hit a 3 and made a follow shot to give the Bucks their first and only lead, 89-88, but later fouled out and wasn't on the court for the dizzying finish. ""I was like, `How bad can it get?' We're down 22. I couldn't get it going but I decided to be aggressive, try and go downhill, try and shoot shots and make plays. Obviously, I was just trying to power through guys,"" Antetokounmpo said. Bogdanovic made five 3-pointers and all 10 free throws on a night when nothing seemed to come easy for most players. ""I was surprised I had a standing ovation, even that I hit a game-winner, so it was a great atmosphere, like a playoff crowd,"" Bogdonovic said. Mike Conley had 20 points, and Mitchell finished with 20, but it was Bogdanovic's time to shine. ""Bogey's still showing the world what he can do. A lot of people still don't know that he's that good, but he really is,"" Conley said. Middleton scored 26 points and Eric Bledsoe had 22 for Milwaukee. The Bucks had won four in a row. ""I think we played as hard as we could. We didn't make shots,"" said Middleton, whose team shot 36%. ""The guys out there gave it our all. It came down to two plays down the stretch that cost us the game."" Mitchell's step-back jumper put Utah up 100-92, but Bledsoe made a couple quick hoops and Middleton made two free throws with 8.0 seconds remaining to knot it at 100. The Jazz led by 25 in the first half, but Antetokounmpo sparked a 21-5 run to start the third quarter and it was tight from there. The Bucks have lost 18 consecutive games since their last road win over the Utah Jazz on Oct. 30, 2001. LOTS TO LEARN, EVEN FROM A WIN The Jazz blew a 22-point lead in the first half and an eight-point advantage in the final 1:31. Snyder noted the jubilation had a tinge of angst. ""Giving up rebounds on a free throw, fouling length of the court, going after an offensive rebound at the wrong time -- there were a number of things that we need to look at it and we will,"" Snyder said. ""We should feel really good about this win ... but there's a lot of things we need to learn from that game."" TIP INS Bucks: Brook Lopez picked up his fifth foul midway through the third quarter and only scored five points. ... Coach Mike Budenholzer unsuccessfully challenged Antetokounmpo's sixth foul on a dunk attempt by Gobert with 53.9 seconds to play. ... The Bucks forced 20 turnovers. Jazz: Dante Exum is still inactive as he recovers from knee surgery, Ed Davis has a fractured leg and Emmanuel Mudiay sat out with hamstring tightness. ... Antetokounmpo poked Bogdanovic in the eye in the fourth quarter and appeared to dislodge his contact lens.","401160766"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Damian Lillard's career- and franchise-high scoring game wasn't enough for the Portland Trail Blazers to get their first home victory of the season. Lillard scored a career-high 60 points for Portland in the Trail Blazers' 119-115 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 34 points and Kyrie Irving had 33 for Brooklyn to help send Portland to its fourth consecutive loss. ""He got 60, but luckily for us he would've needed 65,"" Dinwiddie said of Lillard after the game. Lillard set a franchise record with the highest-scoring game of the season in the NBA. He was 19-of-33 from the field, 7-of-16 from 3-point range and made all 15 of his free throws. ""We tried zone, box-and-one, we tried blitz, we threw the kitchen sink at him,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said of Lillard. ""He just kept making incredible shots."" Earlier Friday night, Warriors guard D'Angelo Russell had 52 points in Golden State's 125-119 overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. It marked just the second time in NBA history that there were multiple 50-point scorers on the same day and both lost, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research. The other came April 9, 1978, when David Thompson of the Nuggets had 73 and George Gervin of the Spurs had 63, both in losing causes. ""It's fine,"" Lillard said about his 60 points coming in a loss. ""It's whatever. Anytime you set records it's obviously good. I guess it's not as fun losing."" Irving, the NBA's second-leading scorer coming in to the game, did his part in the guard matchup for the Nets. He had nine fourth-quarter points and hit a shot to put the Nets up 117-112 with 17.8 seconds left. ""The game could have gone either way as well as [Lillard] was playing,"" Irving said. ""Anytime someone has a big performance like that, it can go either way when he can really take over the game like he did."" Irving said he was also proud of Dinwiddie's performance. ""I'm just trying to stay on him to stay aggressive to be the kind of player he wants to be,"" Irving said of his backcourt mate. ""Tonight was a fresh start for him going into this road trip."" CJ McCollum struggled for most of the night for Portland, missing 14 of his first 16 shots and finishing with only eight points on 4-of-19 shooting. The normally efficient McCollum has struggled to start the season from the field, shooting 38% overall and just 32% from the 3-point line. ""Obviously you'd like to make shots and I haven't,"" McCollum said. ""I'm not playing the way I want to play offensively, that's quite obvious."" "" While the win was big for the Nets as they begin their first long road trip, the loss was Portland's fourth straight as the Blazers fell to 0-3 at home this season. Lillard has been disappointed with the way last season's Western Conference finalists have finished games so far. ""I think we in position to win games and we in position in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter you've got to be present mentally and physically,"" Lillard said. ""You have to do a little bit more than the other team to win games. I think we compete. I think we're together. I think we try to do the right things but that little bit of wanting it more than the other team. And wanting it more doesn't mean playing harder, it means being able to be sharper on one more possession."" Starting small forward Rodney Hood left the game in the first quarter and did not return due to back spasms. That meant first-round pick Nassir Little made his NBA debut. Little got a block and a basket during his first NBA shift, helping Portland cut what had been a 10-point lead down to five. He finished with eight points and three rebounds. ""He had a lot of energy,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of Little's performance. ""I thought he had some momentum plays. I liked his athleticism, his dunks he got the crowd into the game, got our bench into it."" TIP-INS Nets: The stellar play of Irving hasn't been the only bright spot through a 4-4 start. The Nets came into Friday ranked first in the NBA in offensive rebound percentage, which came as an encouraging development to Atkinson. ""I saw that and I was a little surprised,"" Atkinson said. ""We'll see if we can sustain it. But I'm glad because we've also been pretty good at transition defense. If we were 30th in transition defense, I'd be worried. The fact we are balancing those two is a good sign. "" The Nets faced an added challenge Friday as they were without backup center DeAndre Jordan. With no real replacement for him on the roster, the Nets will have to platoon at that spot. ""By committee, we can go big, we can go small,"" Atkinson said. ""We'll see a little bit of both."" Trail Blazers: Adding injury to insult, the Blazers lost another big man when Skal Labissiere suffered a sprained right ankle in the fourth quarter. After losing forward-center Zach Collins for the next few months due to shoulder surgery last week, an injury to Labissiere is the last thing the Blazers need as centers Jusuf Nurkic (leg) and Pau Gasol (foot) are still out indefinitely recovering from their own injuries. Stotts did not have an update on Labissiere or Hood after the game.","401160767"
"LOS ANGELES --  Miami trimmed the Los Angeles Lakers' lead to six points with nearly nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, and Staples Center buckled in for a big finish between two NBA division leaders. Instead, the Heat missed their next 13 shots and scored only six more points all night. The Lakers have two of the world's best offensive players in their lineup, but they're leading the overall NBA standings because of what they're doing on the other end. ""One thing about it -- if your offense is behind your defense, you're a really, really good team,"" LeBron James said. ""And I'm OK with that right now."" Anthony Davis had 26 points and nine rebounds, and James scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' seventh consecutive victory, 95-80 over the Heat on Friday night. James hit a pair of clutch 3-pointers in the waning minutes to seal another impressive win for the Lakers, who haven't lost since their season opener against the Clippers. Davis and James both had moments of brilliance with the ball in their hands, but the Lakers are looking impressive on the defensive end during their outstanding start. ""I had high expectations about what we could be,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have a ton of defensive talent, (and) because the care factor has been high, it's come together pretty quickly."" Miami went 4 of 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Lakers held the Heat to one field goal and six points in the final 8:54. LA limited the Heat to 6-of-35 shooting on 3-pointers and outrebounded them 48-37 to win a meeting of division leaders off to outstanding starts to the new season. ""It's our way,"" Davis said. ""We want to be a good defensive team. That team scores, I think, 115 (points) or something a game. We knew they were coming off a back-to-back, and we just wanted them to make them make shots. They had looks they missed. For the most part, we wanted to run them off the line. They're No. 1 in 3-point field goal percentage, and we held them to 17%."" Butler scored 22 points and Goran Dragic added 19 for the Heat, who still lead the Southeast Division despite losing twice on their three-game Western road trip. One night after scoring 124 points in a win at Phoenix, Miami couldn't find a consistent offensive rhythm. ""Even in the first half, we were playing this game in the mud,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Obviously, we didn't have all of us. We're not making any excuses by any means. That's a great team. ... It just got away from us in the fourth quarter. I still thought we were there with six points, but they just scored three straight possessions and went from there."" Butler scored nine points in the third quarter to keep Miami in striking distance despite its 3-for-24 start on 3-pointers, including 11 consecutive misses spanning halftime. ""They put a lot of pressure on defense,"" Dragic said of the Lakers. ""(With) their rebounding and their skills, you have two really good players. We tried to crowd them as much as possible, and we feel like we did a good job, but then in the end they got 10 more rebounds than us, so that was probably the key."" A THOUSAND TWENTIES James became the third player in NBA history to score 20 points in 1,000 career games. Only Karl Malone (1,134) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,122) have done it more often. James has played 1,206 games in his 17-year career. Kobe Bryant only did it 941 times. ZONE BREAK Miami led for only one possession all night despite employing a zone defense that bothered the Lakers' offense early on. Los Angeles swiftly adjusted to the scheme and moved the ball effectively, getting 30 assists on its 40 field goals. Vogel's plan put the ball in Davis' hands near the free throw line to break down the defense, and he responded with a season-high seven assists. ""Once we get the ball in the middle of the floor, you know, it's pick your poison,"" Davis said. ""I can score, or I can throw a lob to JaVale (McGee) or Dwight (Howard), or find the shooters in the corner. Once we get the ball in the middle of the zone, the rest is just making a play."" TIP-INS Heat: Dwyane Wade watched from the baseline near the Miami bench. The retired superstar spoke to the Heat earlier in the day. Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, are living in nearby ShermanOaks. Wade's oldest son, Zaire, is playing high school basketball with Bronny James at Sierra Canyon. ... Derrick Jones Jr. sat out with a left hip strain. Justise Winslow is in the concussion protocol. Lakers: Rajon Rondo still isn't ready to make his season debut. He has a strained right calf. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  In the midst of Boston's most dominant performance of the season, Celtics point guard Kemba Walker could only muster anger and confusion after learning Gordon Hayward broke his left hand. Jaylen Brown scored 30 points and Boston routed the San Antonio Spurs 135-115 on Saturday in a victory tempered by the loss of Hayward, who will miss at least a month and could face surgery after breaking his left hand late in the first half. ""I was in shock,"" Walker said. ""In those kinds of situations, it's kind of hard to say anything. You just don't even know what to say sometimes. We're going to miss him for the time that he's out."" Walker add 26 points as Boston (7-1) won its seventh straight game and set season highs for total points, first quarter scoring (39 points) and first-half scoring (72 points). There was a somberness to the victory, though, after Hayward suffered his second significant injury since signing with the Celtics three seasons ago. The 6-foot-7 forward missed the 2017 season after breaking his leg six minutes into Boston's season opener. ""This one doesn't feel near as bad as it did two years ago,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""So, he'll be back. Be off for a few weeks or a month or whatever it is."" The Celtics forward broke his left hand after colliding with San Antonio's LaMarcus Aldridge with just over a minute remaining in the first half. Hayward was sent for an X-ray that confirmed the diagnosis. He did not return to the game. ""Going to get with the doctors tomorrow and decide if he needs to do surgery or not,"" Stevens said. ""Sounds like should he decide that the surgery option (is best, it) might actually be a better timeline. So, we'll see what that all plays out to be."" DeMar DeRozan had 22 points for the Spurs (5-4), who trailed by as many as 22 points in a lackluster effort of an early tipoff. ""What surprises me is that we were so unaggressive and so unphysical,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. Boston has not lost since dropping its season opener to Philadelphia, 107-93, on Oct. 23. The Celtics have outscored their opponents 115-101 since that loss and raised that dominance against the Spurs. Boston sped up its pace and went on a 19-3 run after giving up the game's first seven points. Every Celtics starter scored during the run, including seven straight points from Brown to ignite the rally. Popovich called a full timeout and replaced all five of his starters in one mass substitution five minutes into the game, but that didn't stem Boston's momentum. ""They move the ball extremely well, they play well together and we caught onto that a little bit too late,"" DeRozan said. The dominance continued throughout the second quarter until Hayward exited. Hayward winced in pain after banging his left hand against Aldridge's chest attempting to get past the Spurs forward on a screen late in the first half. Hayward appeared to jam the hand once or twice more against Aldridge before exiting the game. ""Gordon's really playing well right now and we're leaning on him to help us with this season and this run we're trying to make,"" Brown said. ""I know that's really tough. Any time you deal with an injury like that, that's disheartening."" Hayward had nine points and two rebounds in 15 minutes before exiting. STILL RIDING San Antonio reserve point guard Derrick White continued to ride a stationary bike to stay loose after suffering a hard fall to the court against the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 3. White remained in the game against the Lakers following the fall, but his backside has tightened up since. ""I felt better today than I have the past couple of games,"" White said. ""Just try to keep it loose the best I can."" White said his time away from the bench should end soon. ""Maybe next game and then that will be it,"" White said. ""I don't like being over there but I've got to do what I've got to do."" TIP-INS Celtics: Center Enes Kanter missed his seventh straight game after suffering a bruised left knee in Boston's season opener. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Kanter felt good after participating in pregame workouts but is still not ready to play. ... Marcus Smart exited with 9:47 remaining in the game after taking a knee to the groin. Smart attempted to walk off the injury but quickly signaled for a substitution after doubling over in pain. Spurs: Aldridge averaged 40 points per game against Boston last season but was limited to three points on 1-for-4 shooting Saturday. . San Antonio's last home loss to Boston was March 31, 2011. Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce combined for 63 points in the victory.","401160769"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry could only manage a sarcastic grin after his team's second win of the season. He knows it wasn't pretty. ""Well, I don't think they're sending that (game tape) to Springfield anytime soon,"" Gentry said, referring to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Brandon Ingram had 25 points and nine rebounds, and New Orleans overcame 26 turnovers to beat the Charlotte Hornets 115-110 on Saturday night. Charlotte had 22 turnovers, making for a sloppy game all around that lacked any type of flow until the final minutes. JJ Redick, who replaced the injured Lonzo Ball in the starting lineup, had 22 points on five 3-pointers and Jrue Holiday added 12 points and 11 assists for the Pelicans (2-7). Ball sat out with a right abductor sprain. ""I just thought we turned the ball over way too much, we've just got to get better in that department right there. And they're careless turnovers,"" Gentry said. ""... We grinded it out and found a way to win and to me that's the most important thing."" Despite the ugly win, it was another solid performance for Ingram, who was born and raised in Kinston, North Carolina. He finished 8 of 12 from the field and had 10 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Pelicans seize the momentum while the Hornets went cold down the stretch, going 3  1/2 minutes during one stretch without a point. ""I mean B.I. is a baller, that's our go-to guy, him and Jrue down the stretch we want to get the ball in their hands and just let them make plays even for themselves or for other people,"" said Pelicans forward Kenrick Williams. Hornets coach James Borrego wasn't pleased with his team's performance, either. ""It's sloppy execution, it's not taking pride in making the right play or pass,"" Borrego said. With the game tied at 95 with five minutes left, Josh Hart knocked down a go-ahead 3 igniting an 11-2 run that figured to be the difference in the game. Hart had 10 points and seven rebounds coming off the bench. GRAHAM KEEPS ROLLING Backup point guard Devonte Graham led the Hornets with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Graham entered the game ranked third among all bench players in the league with seven assists per game. But the second-year player from Kansas was more concerned about the overall sloppy play, saying ""we talk about it all the time, you've got to limit the turnovers. We did a good job of that the last couple of games, but this game we were a little lazy with the ball."" REDICK SHINES The Pelicans were able to get Redick involved in the offense, and he looked just as confident as ever shooting the 3. ""For the first time this season I feel like we were able to free JJ up for some good looks that he didn't really try to have to force up,"" Gentry said. ""We did a good job early on with the pace of the game and we got him into a situation where we were able to drive and kick and have him have some good looks and he took advantage of it I thought."" TIP INS Pelicans: There were dozens of fans in the crowd with Zion Williamson jerseys, although the No. 1 overall pick remains out of action recovering from a knee injury. ... In the something-you-don't-see every day category, Nicolo Melli was originally credited with a 3-pointer in the second quarter, but when officials went back to review the play they realized he had stepped out of bounds and the basket was taken away. Hornets: Malik Monk showed his athleticism when he skied high above Josh Hart and threw down a one-handed dunk off an alley-oop pass from Devonte Graham. ... Rookie P.J. Washington missed a good chunk of the game with an ankle injury but did return.","401160770"
"CHICAGO --  For James Harden, a missed shot simply means the odds of him making the next one improve. That attitude served the All-Star guard well Saturday night as he rebounded from a slow start to put up big numbers again. Harden narrowly missed his first triple-double of the season, finishing with 42 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists as the Houston Rockets pulled away in the second half and beat the Chicago Bulls 117-94. After going 2 for 7 (including 1 for 5 on 3-pointers) in the first quarter, he went 10 for 20 the rest of the game, including 8 for 14 on 3's. ""That's the confidence I have,"" he said. ""That's the confidence that I've built off of the work I put in. It's more of a mindset."" Harden, the NBA's leading scorer, entered the game averaging 36.5 points on 38.7% shooting, including 27% on 3-pointers. ""I feel like a broken record sometimes, but he's a master of getting what he wants,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said of Harden. ""I think sometimes he might get bored in the game and tries different stuff."" Russell Westbrook scored 26 points as the Rockets won their third straight. Wendell Carter Jr. had 13 points and 16 rebounds for Chicago, which has dropped six of eight. The Bulls were a woeful 4-for-32 shooting from 3-point range. ""I know how well we can shoot and tonight we just didn't make them,"" Chicago forward Lauri Markkanen said. Chicago led 27-20 after one quarter behind eight points from Markkanen and eight Houston turnovers. The Bulls led by nine points (31-22) early in the second before the Rockets used a 24-7 run to take control and open a 46-38 lead with four minutes left in the first half. Harden had nine points during the run. Chicago closed within 50-49 at halftime on a 3-pointer by Zach LaVine. That was the Bulls second make in 17 first-half attempts from long range. Houston quickly reclaimed control with a 30-9 run in the opening 9:41 of the third, taking an 80-58 advantage. The Rockets had an 86-67 lead entering the fourth, helped by 7-for-14 shooting from 3-pointers range in the third. Harden led the way with 11 points in the quarter. The Bulls couldn't get closer than 14 points in the fourth quarter. ""I think we did really good in the first half; they just broke it open in the third quarter,"" LaVine said. ""We played a good first half and a bad second half."" Harden, who has 35 regular-season triple-doubles in his career, had several minutes of garbage time in the fourth quarter to get additional assists, but was unsuccessful before leaving with a little more than three minutes remaining. ""I didn't even know I was one assist away,"" he said. ""I'm happy we won, though."" NUMBERS GAME Houston went 19 for 44 (43.2%) on 3-pointers to clearly outclass the Bulls from behind the arc. ""They made 19 threes, we made four, so we lost the 3-point line by 45 points,"" Chicago coach Jim Boylen said. ""It's hard to win a game."" DEFENSE Westbrook believes the Rockets had a lot to do with the Bulls' poor shooting. ""If you're gonna win in this league, you've got to defend,"" he said. ""There are no nights off. You've got to defend every single night against some tough teams."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon (left hamstring) returned after sitting out Wednesday against Golden State. He had nine points and 21 minutes off the bench. ... Houston has won the last seven games against Chicago, including the last four at the United Center.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Luka Doncic missed his fifth triple-double of the season primarily because Dallas didn't need him in the fourth quarter. Doncic had 24 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists to lead the Mavericks to a 138-122 victory over Memphis on Saturday night. Doncic recorded his stats in three quarters as Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle sat the second-year guard while Dallas maintained a double-digit lead in the final period. Kristaps Porzingis already had taken the night off recovering from a left knee injury. ""It was a really good effort from start to finish,"" Carlisle said. ""Had a real even contribution from top to bottom. The second unit, obviously came in and was very strong."" Doncic was part of eight Mavericks reaching double figures as Dallas had its highest scoring output of the season. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 20 points for Dallas, Justin Jackson had 17 points and Seth Curry scored 16, all in the first half. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 23 points on 10-for-17 shooting from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers. Jae Crowder added 18 points for the Grizzlies, which lost their second straight. Memphis played without leading scorer and rookie Ja Morant, who took the night off for rest. Additionally, rookie forward Brandon Clarke did not play due to injury maintenance on a sore back. For the Grizzlies, the offense is there, but the defense is not. The Mavericks' 138 points was the most surrendered by Memphis this season. Over the last three games, opponents have averaged just more than 125 points a game. ""The numbers are off the chart,"" Memphis center Jonas Valanciunas said. ""We've got to do a better job on defense."" Before Doncic took the rest of the night off, he helped Dallas pull away in the third quarter, scoring 14 points to give the Mavericks a 104-91 lead entering the fourth. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins noted his team's defensive struggles, including the Mavericks connecting on 18 3-pointers. ""That makes it tough,"" Jenkins said. ""But back-to-back nights, as we try to solidify this defensive identity about anchoring down, protecting the paint and (no) second-chance points, it's a struggle."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Boban Marjanovic started his first game of the season. ... The stop in Memphis was the first of a three-game, six-day road trip that will carry Dallas 3,535 miles. ...

G Grayson Allen missed his fourth straight game with left ankle soreness. ... Rookie Marko Guduric scored 14 points, the first time he has reached double figures in the young season. MAVERICK ROTATIONS Carlisle shuffled players through the night, no one playing 30 minutes, and the reserves provided 67 points. ""We've got a lot of guys that can contribute on any given night,"" Justin Jackson said. ""I think it showed (Saturday), for sure. .Whether you are starting, you're not playing, or you are just playing a little bit, you have to go out and make your minutes count.""

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Despite beating the banged-up Golden State Warriors for the second time this season, the Oklahoma City Thunder know they need to be more consistent. Danilo Gallinari scored 19 points, Dennis Schroder added 18, and the Thunder beat the Warriors 114-108 on Saturday night. Oklahoma City led by 23 late in the second quarter before Golden State roared back to tie the score heading to the fourth. The Thunder then went up by 14 midway through the fourth, and the Warriors mounted another rally before falling short. ""I mean we showed that we can turn it on, but you know that's not going to work most nights in the league,"" said the Thunder's Chris Paul, who had 16 points and nine assists. Steven Adams scored 13 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 12 to help the Thunder win for the third time in four games.

One night earlier, Russell had a career-high 52 against Minnesota. Alec Burks had 23 points for the Warriors, and Glenn Robinson III finished with 18. Omari Spellman sprained his left ankle and didn't return after halftime. ""We are a young team that is learning, but I'm not happy with where we are,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""We should not just accept our fate.

Oklahoma City: The Thunder had 30 assists on 43 made baskets, using terrific ball movement and great screens to spring shooters. Schroder led the Thunder with six assists. ""I think we moved it really well especially in the first half,"" Mike Muscala said. ""I think all of our guards do such a good job finding guys and moving the ball. It's fun to play like that."" 3-POINT BARRAGE The Thunder weren't afraid to shoot, going 14 for 30 (46.7 percent) on 3-point attempts after coming into the contest averaging 35.7 percent.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  One game after a team-record comeback, the Denver Nuggets allowed the Minnesota Timberwolves to nearly do the same. Nikola Jokic saved Denver each time. Jokic hit a fadeaway jumper with 2.4 seconds left to give the Nuggets a 100-98 overtime victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. ""At this point, you just sit back and watch it,"" Denver forward Paul Millsap said. ""I believe in the shots he's making, and in those situations we've just got to give it to him."" Jokic was in a similar spot, hitting a winning jumper with 2.2 seconds left Friday night in a comeback victory at home against Philadelphia.

Millsap scored all 14 of his points during a big third-quarter run and had 10 rebounds. ""They had really good momentum and we didn't shoot well,"" Jokic said of the late-game collapse. ""They were really aggressive. But they sent it to overtime, which was good for us. It gave us options to win the game."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 25 points and 16 rebounds for Minnesota. Towns pushed the game to overtime with a corner 3, but the Wolves shot a season-low 13.3% from 3-point range and 35.1% overall from the field. Andrew Wiggins added 25 points in Minnesota's third loss in four games. ""We understand we play tomorrow,"" Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""We said with about six minutes left, we're going to make one push here, give it about a minute and a half. We're down 16. These guys came back, they fought. I give so much credit to our players."" Denver led by 16 in the fourth when Gary Harris hit a 3 with 6:41 left. The Nuggets went scoreless the remainder of regulation and Minnesota put together a 16-0 streak. ""We have to better in terms of playing with the lead and closing games out,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""But we never panicked. I thought Will Barton down the stretch was huge -- he made some big plays for us. Poised, he was under control. Nikola makes another improbable shot. He just adds to the legend of Nikola Jokic."" KEEP SHOOTING With Saunders, Minnesota has placed an added emphasis on the 3 this year. The Wolves entered the game with the third-most attempts in the league at 40.5 per-game. But they were just 25th while hitting 31.8% of the shots. Minnesota was 0 for 10 from beyond the arc in the third as Denver took control, and 2 for 22 in the second half and overtime. The Wolves' previous worst 3-point shooting performance was Friday night against Golden State when it was 9 of 36. They are 15 of 81 from 3 in the two games. ""There was a lot of good looks,"" said forward Robert Covington, who was 0 of 2 from 3. ""Them shots are going to fall, it's just, got to believe in them, that's all."" MURRAY'S MIX Coming off one of his best games of the season, Denver point guard Jamal Murray was clicking early, scoring 12 of the team's first 19 points while making all five of his shots. Murray left the game just 41 seconds into the second half with left foot soreness but later returned. He scored all 15 of his points in the first half and was 0-of-8 shooting in the second half. TIP INS Nuggets: Backup guard Malik Beasley left with an illness after playing five scoreless minutes. ... The Nuggets are 22-9 at Target Center since 2004-05. Timberwolves: Point guards Jeff Teague (illness) and Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain) each missed their third straight game. ... Minnesota had one turnover in the first quarter. .

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Even without injured stars Victor Oladipo and Myles Turner, the Indiana Pacers are managing to pile up wins. Domantas Sabonis had 21 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists, and Malcolm Brogdon and T.J. Wareen each scored 19 to help the Pacers beat the Orlando Magic 109-102 on Sunday for their sixth win in seven games. Doug McDermott had 18 points and T.J. McConnell added 12 points and eight assists and were the difference-makers as Indiana erased a nine-point halftime deficit by outscoring Orlando 58-42 in the second half. ""I thought both groups (starters and reserves) were solid, but you need your second group to play like these guys have been playing,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We had good ball movement, our guys were sharing the ball and defending hard. When you do that, you're going to be tough to beat."" Evan Fournier scored 22 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 17 rebounds, and Aaron Gordon added 13 points as the Magic lost for the fifth time in six games. Orlando had its best offensive half of the season in the first two quarters, shooting 55.3 percent, including eight of 13 from behind the 3-point line. The second half was a totally different story. Indiana limited the Magic to 35.7 percent shooting, overtaking Orlando with 12-0 and 18-8 runs to start the third and fourth quarters respectively. ""They scored every which way you could in the first half,"" McMillan said. ""We really put no pressure on them at all, but we did a better job establishing our defense and getting pressure on the ball in the second half."" The Pacers led 81-77 going into the fourth quarter and pushed the lead to 14 points with a spark from McConnell. The Magic guards couldn't stay with McConnell on the pick-and-roll and the Pacers' backup point guard made them pay, hitting three straight short jumpers. He also had four assists in the game-deciding run, two to McDermott, who hit seven of 13 shots for the game. ""I think the second unit is always going to provide energy,"" McConnell said. ""I think that's what a bench is supposed to do. We're getting more comfortable with each other, we're finding each other, moving without the ball, screening, executing and that's really all you can ask."" Orlando made only three of its first 15 shots in the fourth before D.J. Augustin's runner got things back on track. The closest the Magic could get was 105-99 on a driving layup by Markell Fultz with 40 seconds to play. However, Brogdon made a 3-pointer on Indiana's next possession to put the game away. ""I'm surprised and really disappointed,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""To start the third quarter, they crushed us. The two most important players in the game, in my opinion, were (T.J.) McConnell and (Doug) McDermott. Those two guys drilled us."" The Pacers erased a 60-51 halftime deficit by scoring the first 12 points of the second half, including six straight from Brogdon at the end of the run. Indiana outscored Orlando 31-17 in the quarter, hitting 12 of 22 shots (59 percent). The first half was Orlando's best offensive half of the season. The Magic shot 55.3 percent, including eight of 13 from behind the 3-point line. Fournier hit all three of his 3s and four of five shots for 11 points, and Vucevic also had 11 to help Orlando to its nine-point halftime lead.

Indiana had only five attempts, four in the second half. ""We looked at that at halftime and they had zero attempts so that meant we weren't being aggressive,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""Not that you want to be out there fouling, but they were burning us without going to the free throw line so we just needed to be more aggressive and our guys responded.""","401160775"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons watched the 76ers' game in street clothes, bothered by a shoulder injury but feeling downright sunny about their chances after a rough road trip. ""I feel great,"" Simmons said. ""Woke up on a beautiful Sunday, excited to see my team play."" The 76ers were delighted to give an effort worth watching. Joel Embiid returned from a bumpy road trip in which his maturityand fitness were questioned to score 18 points and grab nine rebounds, and Furkan Korkmaz scored 17 points to help Philadelphia snap a three-game losing streak with a 114-106 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night. Embiid played in Philly for the first time since his Oct. 30 fight with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns earned the All-Star center a two-game suspension. Embiid missed the first two games of a four-game road trip (including a win at Portland) and huffed and puffed his way through a lethargic defensive effort in a loss in the finale at Denver. Coach Brett Brown blamed Embiid's ineffectiveness on the layoff and the altitude in Colorado. ""It's clear the time off for Joel didn't help,"" Brown said. ""Joel didn't have one of the Joel games that we need."" He seemed up for the challenge at home. Embiid hustled from the opening tip and scored 15 points in the first half in a mismatched matchup against Bismack Biyombo and Cody Zeller. He blocked a Devonte Graham shot that led to a James Ennis III slam on the other end, and pump-faked his way into a basket and a foul whistled on Biyombo. Embiid, though, couldn't do much when the Hornets ripped a 12-2 run late in the half to take a 58-53 lead into the break. He only played 26 minutes (shot 6 of 10 overall) and got a breather down the stretch once the 76ers blew this one open in the fourth. Embiid passed the fitness test -- but declined to talk to the media. ""We're trying to get Joel in increasingly better and better and better shape,"" Brown said. ""I thought Zeller made him run a lot in the first half."" Korkmaz keyed a Sixers' run in the third quarter in their return home from the 1/3 trip. Korkmaz hit a 3 with just 0.4 seconds left to beat Portland for Philadelphia's lone win on the trip. Against the Hornets, he hit a pair of 3s and a floater in the third that helped push the lead to double digits and sent the Sixers on their way to a needed victory. ""The team trusts me, the coaching staff, they trust me a lot,"" Korkmaz said. ""I think I'm in good shape right now. I just feel good."" The 22-year-old Korkmaz, a first-round pick in the 2016 draft, had an uneven first two seasons in Philadelphia and played in only 62 total games. The Sixers even declined to pick up the third-year option on his contract before last season. But Korkmaz gives the Sixers a long-range threat they need and he signed a two-year deal in the offseason with the potential of more playing time ahead. ""(Coach) just told me this was all on the table,"" Korkmaz said. ""Just fight for your spot. If you make good, I will give it to you. I just came into training camp with that mindset."" Korkmaz had the play of the game on his behind-the-back pass to Raul Neto for a 3-pointer in the first half. Neto got the start because Simmons missed his second straight game because of a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. Simmons will be re-evaluated Monday. Zeller had 24 points for a Hornets team that had lost at home to New Orleans on Saturday. The Hornets hit three 3s in the final two minutes, making the rout look much more competitive than they were for most of the second half. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum sat out (middle finger). ...

""We didn't come out with that same aggressiveness to start the third quarter,"" coach James Borrego said. ""They really jumped on us, they made shots. We didn't carry that momentum from the first half into the second half."" PROTECT THE BALL The 76ers had 20 turnovers. ""We have to find a discipline and a better way to control that,"" Brown said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn't contain his frustration after a subpar first half. Somewhere between the court and the locker room, the Milwaukee Bucks star kicked -- and destroyed -- a sign with a Thunder logo that is part of a temporary barrier. The reigning league MVP regretted his actions. ""You know, there's no excuse there, and obviously I'll try to pay for the sign, or I can trade you guys for the Bucks sign when you guys come to Milwaukee,"" he said. ""But there's no excuse for that. But obviously, playing basketball is a lot of frustration and a lot of emotion, and obviously, moments like that happen."" He channeled his fire in the second half. He scored 24 of his 35 points after the break to help the Milwaukee Bucks rally and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-119 on Sunday night. His first half, by his standards, was forgettable. He scored 11 points on 4-for-8 shooting and had six rebounds. Most important, the Thunder led by six. ""I wasn't playing good basketball,"" he said. ""I wasn't being as aggressive as I wanted."" In the second half, he made 9 of 11 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds. Thunder guard Chris Paul said it's a challenge to defend a 6-foot-11 player who can drive. ""You think `back up, back up,' but by the time you keep backing up, he's at the rim,"" Paul said. Eric Bledsoe added 25 points and nine assists for the Bucks, who have won five of six.

Gallinari missed a clean look at a 3, then Milwaukee's George Hill made two free throws with 10.5 seconds left to put the Bucks in control.

"Knicks president Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry address the media to voice their displeasure after the Knicks' 108-87 loss to the Cavaliers on Nov. 10. (1:11) NEW YORK --  The Cleveland Cavaliers beat New York for their first winning streak of the season. Another loss prompted Knicks' officials to address the team's slow start. Collin Sexton scored 31 points and the Cavaliers beat the Knicks 108-87 on Sunday night. Kevin Love and Jordan Clarkson each added 17 points for Cleveland (4-5), which won two games in a row for the first time in the young season. The Cavaliers were coming off a 113-100 win over Washington on Friday. ""Right from the get-go we shared the ball, we had 20-some assists,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""We only had 12 turnovers and we forced them into 21 turnovers, and they only shot 35%. ""Both ends of the floor, I think this was one of our better performances."" The Knicks couldn't say the same. Julius Randle had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Alonzo Trier added 13 points for New York, which fell to 2-8, last in the Eastern Conference. ""Obviously, (GM) Scott (Perry) and I are not happy with where we are right now,"" Knicks President Steve Mills said following the loss. ""We think the team is not performing to the level that we anticipated or we expected to perform, and it's something that we collectively have to do a better job of delivering the product on the floor that we said we would do at the start of this season. ""We still believe in our coaching staff. We believe in the plan Scott and I put together and the players that we've assembled, but we also have to acknowledge that we haven't played at the level we expected to play at."" According to Mills, he and Knicks general manager Scott Perry spoke with owner James Dolan during the game, which included several rounds of boos from fans in attendance. ""I mean Jim still believes in the plan that we put together, but he's passionate as we are about this,"" Mills said. ""He would want us to have better results on the floor. But I think Jim is a fan and believes in what we are doing, but he has the same kind of expectations that we have. And this is really about how we feel about what we should be doing, what we should be delivering as a group and we all take responsibility."" Following Mills and Perry at the podium, coach David Fizdale was asked if he feels a sense of urgency to get the Knicks  turned around quickly. ""I live in that sense of urgency,"" Fizdale said. ""I don't need anyone to speak to give me a sense of urgency. I'm not cruising through this thing acting like I've got a bunch of time to get a team together. Every day I have urgency about this team about how I coach them, about getting them better, about building consistent habits."" Cleveland opened the second half on an 18-6 run and led the Knicks by as many as 30 in the third quarter. Following a driving layup from Sexton at the 6:48 mark of the third quarter, fans booed the Knicks heavily. The Cavaliers took a 54-36 lead into the half as Sexton led all scorers with 16 points. The Knicks struggled mightily from the field shooting 16 for 43 in the first half, taking many contested long two-pointers. Beilein had high praise for Sexton's defensive development. ""I love the way he attacks the basket, but I think what's being underrated here is his growth from last year to this year on his defense,"" the coach said. ""You can see he'll still make a mistake every now and then -- everybody does -- but for the most part, he's an athlete who should become a very good defender."" Cleveland busted out of the gate and led 14-4 as Sexton scored nine points to open the game.

"PHOENIX --  Ricky Rubio is a pass-first point guard. Sunday night, he showed he can score when the shots are there as well. Rubio had a season-high 22 points, the most he's had since February of last season with Utah, and added 12 of the Phoenix Suns' 37 assists in a 138-112 rout of the Brooklyn Nets. Devin Booker led the Suns with 27 points, shooting 10 of 14 from the field and making 4 of 5 3-pointers to go with nine assists. ""We moved the ball. We played super unselfish,"" Rubio said. ""That is super fun to play."" Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 points, rookie Cameron Johnson had a career-high 15. The Suns trailed just once, at 1-0. The Suns shot 54 percent through three quarters, hitting 16 of 34 on 3-pointers, and cruised in the final period. They won for the fourth time in five games and ended the Nets' four-game winning streak in Phoenix. Spencer Dinwiddie led the Nets with 18 points. Kyrie Irving finished with 15 points on 7-of-16 shooting. ""I don't think I shot one free throw, which is a tell-tale sign of just how aggressive I am not in the game,"" Irving said. ""A lot of the accountability falls on me and really the game plan of guarding Ricky and not being in the right spots."" The Suns made 10 of their first 11 shots, including 4 of 5 3-pointers. Phoenix led by 20 points in the quarter. Center Aaron Baynes hit two 3s inside the first 3 minutes and had two dunks. The flustered Nets trailed by 19 points, 32-13, with 4:35 left in the first quarter, having turned the ball over five times and been whistled for six fouls. Coach Kenny Atkinson was called for a technical foul for going out on the court to vent at the officials. That seemed to stir the Nets, who cut it to 37-30 by the end of the quarter. The Nets made it 42-40 on the third of Garrett Temple's three 3s off the bench as the Suns cooled off until the last half of the second quarter. Up only two, 46-44 at the 6-minute mark, Phoenix finished the quarter on a 22-6 run for a lead. Oubre capped it off with a 3 from the top of the arc at the buzzer -- part of his 16 points in the half -- then jogged off the court with his arms raised. ""We came out connecting on all cylinders,"" Oubre said. ""We move it around, it doesn't matter who scores as long as everybody touches it. ""Nights like this, it's scary,"" he added. The Suns built on their lead in the third. Dario Saric knocked down a 3 with 6:32 to make it 85-59, and went up 102-73 on Booker's 31-foot 3-pointer at the 2:06 mark. ""What's not to like?"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""It was a big-time effort on our part to do what we do, share the ball. I thought Ricky set the tone."" OUBRE PUMPS UP Oubre, known for his energetic style of play, got the home crowd going after he took a hard foul from Jordan with 58 seconds to play in the first half and tumbled to the floor. Instead of getting up immediately, he did a couple of push-ups, then walked to the free throw line and made both shots. SEVEN FOR 3 Sunday was the first game in Suns history where seven different players made two or more 3-pointers, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. That included all five starters.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard huddled with the Trail Blazers after regulation against Atlanta, searching for overtime motivation after a four-game losing streak. ""I just turned to the group and I told them that, sometimes when you're struggling and having a hard time like we have, you get put in these types of situations, where you've got to see how bad you want it,"" Lillard said. ""You've got to dig out and do it as a group."" The Blazers proved they indeed wanted it in the end, snapping the losing streak with a 124-113 overtime victory over the Hawks on Sunday night. Lillard finished with 30 points. Kent Bazemore made back-to-back 3-pointers to open the extra period, sending the Blazers to their first win at home this season. Trae Young had 35 points and 10 assists for Atlanta, which has lost three straight games and six of its last seven. It was a tight game throughout, but especially heated in the final moments of regulation as both teams wrestled for the win. With a 103-102 edge, Blazers coach Terry Stotts challenged a foul call on Hassan Whiteside with 1:09 left. It was successful and CJ McCollum's jumper extended the lead to 105-102 with 52.5 seconds left. Kevin Huerter's 3-pointer for Atlanta tied it at 105 with 27.9 seconds to go. Lillard answered with a layup that gave Portland back the lead but Huerter's layup tied it up again with 0.7 seconds on the clock, sending the game to overtime. After Bazemore's 3-pointers against his former team, McCollum's 3 extended the lead to 118-111 to all but seal it. McCollum finished with 23 points and Whiteside added 21 points and 11 rebounds. ""They started out every quarter on a run and the same thing happened at the end. They started out on a run and it was too late then to catch back up,"" Young said. The Blazers were coming off a 119-115 loss to the Nets on Friday night, which marred Lillard's big night with a personal best and franchise record 60 points. Portland has been beset by injuries. Forward Zach Collins appeared in three games this season before surgery on his shoulder that will sideline him at least four months. Forward Rodney Hood left Friday's game with back spasms and was unavailable against the Hawks. But the Blazers saw the return of Skal Labissiere, who sprained his ankle in the fourth quarter against the Nets.  And Whiteside, who was day-to-day with a right foot sprain, started. ""We needed it,"" Stotts said about the victory. ""No matter how we got it, we got it."" The Hawks were coming off to a 121-109 loss at home to Sacramento Kings 121-109 on Friday night. Atlanta is also dealing with injuries: Evan Turner, a former Blazer, missed his sixth game with an Achilles issue while Allen Crabbe remained out after knee surgery last April. Crabbe, upgraded to questionable before the game, was dressed but did not play. Lloyd Pierce started Huerter instead of Cam Reddish, who had started the Hawks' previous eight games. ""The home team came up big in the fourth quarter so credit to them but I thought our guys played their tails off tonight,"" Pierce said. Whiteside's dunk put the Blazers up 18-10 early but by the end of the first period the Hawks closed the gap and went up 21-20 after Young's basket. Portland reclaimed the lead, going up 40-33 on Gary Trent Jr.'s jumper. Atlanta closed to within 46-44 at the half. Anthony Tolliver's layup for Portland tied the game at 73 late in the third period. Anfernee Simons, who had 12 points in the third quarter alone, pulled Portland in front 78-75 with a driving layup and free throw in the fourth. Lillard's step-back 3-pointer and layup gave Portland an 85-82 advantage, but Parker's jumper narrowed the gap for the Hawks. Parker finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds for Atlanta. TIP INS: Hawks: The game was the first of a five-game trip. ... Vince Carter was not with the team because of personal reasons. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Pascal Siakam had 24 points and 11 rebounds, Fred VanVleet finished with 23 points and 10 assists and the Toronto Raptors snapped the Los Angeles Lakers' seven-game winning streak with a 113-104 victory Sunday night. Chris Boucher matched his career high with 15 points for the Raptors, who have won three straight and six of seven. The defending NBA champions played without two key regulars after losing starter Kyle Lowry to a broken left thumb and top reserve Serge Ibaka to a sprained right ankle, but Toronto still rallied in the fourth quarter and hung on late for its 10th consecutive win over the Lakers. Anthony Davis scored 27 points and LeBron James had 13 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds in his 85th career triple-double, but the Lakers lost for the first time since opening night against the Clippers. Toronto led 104-92 with 3:50 to play on Terence Davis' third 3-pointer after a rally by four reserves and Siakam, but Kyle Kuzma hit back-to-back 3-pointers while LA scored eight straight points. The Lakers then missed four consecutive 3-pointers with the chance to pull even, and Siakam threw down back-to-back dunks on the fast break to seal it. Norman Powell scored 14 points while starting in Lowry's spot for Toronto. Davis and James both had big games, but the Lakers' supporting cast wasn't helpful and their team defense didn't look nearly as sharp as it had been in recent games. Kuzma scored 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Danny Green went scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting in 27 minutes for the Lakers, who signed him to a two-year free agent deal in the summer. The sharpshooting veteran won a ring with the Raptors last year while shooting a career-high 45.5% on 3-pointers during his sole season in Toronto. Siakam got off to a 3-for-15 start from the field, preventing him from matching his 44-point effort at New Orleans two nights ago. But he excelled in the second half, particularly in a lineup including four reserves as Toronto jumped to its first double-digit lead of the night early in the fourth quarter. Toronto opened the fourth with a 17-6 run led by nine points from Boucher, the undrafted Canadian who was on the last two teams to win the NBA title.

"DETROIT --  The Minnesota Timberwolves shot an abysmal 6 of 45 from 3-point range in a loss to Denver over the weekend. That evened out in a hurry against Detroit. Andrew Wiggins scored 33 points, and Minnesota spoiled Blake Griffin's return Monday night, beating the Pistons 120-114. The Timberwolves shot 8 of 10 from beyond the arc in the first quarter to take a 15-point lead, and they held Detroit at bay after that. ""We talked this morning -- how we made sure there weren't any lids on the basket,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""They deserve a win like this on a back-to-back."" Griffin played for the first time this season, coming back from hamstring and knee issues. Derrick Rose also returned to the Detroit lineup from a strained hamstring, but both he and Griffin played limited minutes. Griffin scored 19 points but Rose added just six. ""We've just got to ask the question: Do we want to win -- are we going to come out and play hard, or going to get spanked like this every night?"" Rose said. ""We need everybody to be on the same page. We need everybody to move in a collective group. We've got to figure it out."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 25 points for Minnesota, which snapped an eight-game losing streak to the Pistons. After a 100-98 overtime loss to Denver on Sunday, Minnesota was sharp at the start of this game. The Timberwolves led 41-26 after one, and the Pistons never cut too far into the deficit until the fourth. A 3-pointer by Detroit's Tony Snell made it 109-104, but Towns drew a double team at the other end and passed to an open Wiggins, whose 3-pointer restored the lead to eight. ""Every good thing that happens to Andrew, Andrew deserves, because Andrew does work hard,"" Saunders said. ""He had a different mindset this summer. We had a conversation, so all the credit goes to him for buying in and really delivering for us."" Minnesota led by 19 in the third before the Pistons ran off eight points in a row. Towns ended that quarter with a driving dunk that put the Timberwolves ahead 92-81. Minnesota was without point guard Jeff Teague (illness). Luke Kennard led Detroit with 25 points, and Snell scored 16. Andre Drummond had 11 points and 12 rebounds, but he went just 4 of 12 from the field. MANAGING MINUTES Griffin played 23:58 and Rose only 19:54. Coach Dwane Casey acknowledged it was hard getting them on the court for significant time together. ""Believe me, it's a trigonometry lesson,"" Casey said. ""I know it's for their health and all that stuff, but it's difficult. It's difficult for the team and it's difficult for their teammates to come in and get a good rhythm, but somehow, someway we have to get a rhythm if that is who we are going to be."" Griffin said the chemistry between him and Rose -- a new acquisition this season -- should be OK. ""He's a great player. Players like that are easy to play with,"" Griffin said. ""Some nights it might be his night. Some nights it might be mine. Some nights it might be neither, but we'll be able to affect the game whether we're scoring the basketball or not."" SHARP SHOOTING Each team had a reserve shooting well. Minnesota's Jake Layman made four 3-pointers and scored 16 points. Detroit's Langston Galloway made four 3s of his own and finished with 18 points. ""I feel like I have been getting great shots every game,"" Layman said. ""Some games they haven't been falling, but it's all great looks all around our offense. So, I'm going to keep doing the same thing."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without G Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain). ... The Timberwolves finished 15 of 34 from 3-point range. Pistons: G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction) did not play.","401160782"
"Luka Doncic hits the crowd with a Michael Jordan-like shrug after draining a deep 3-pointer. (0:25) BOSTON --  Kemba Walker took on some extra responsibility at the offensive end in Boston's first game since Gordon Hayward broke his left hand. Walker made a trio of key 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and finished with 29 points, Jaylen Brown added 25 points and 11 rebounds, and the Celtics beat the Dallas Mavericks 116-106 Monday night. ""I was just trying to be aggressive, trying to make the right plays,"" Walker said. ""My shot felt good the whole night. I was just missing them. Then, in the fourth quarter, just naturally, the competitive nature just comes out and I try to do what I can do to put the ball in the basket."" Marcus Smart scored 17 points, Daniel Theis chipped in with 11 and Brad Wanamaker had 10 for Boston, which won its eighth straight game since a season-opening loss at Philadelphia. Jayson Tatum shot 1 for 18 from the field and scored only five points for the Celtics. Luka Doncic led the Mavericks (6-4) with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Maxi Kleber had 15 points with eight boards. Kristaps Porzingis scored just four points on 1-of-11 shooting for Dallas. ""Porzingis had a tough night. We're just going to flush it and move on,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said with a laugh. ""You know, there's nights like this. You've just got to flush it and move forward."" Porzingis took a lot of blame for the loss. ""I had an off night tonight, and guys stepped up,"" he said. ""Guys fought until the end, and we were right there. If I had a better game, the result could have been much different."" The Celtics released a statement during the opening quarter that said Hayward had surgery Monday to repair a fracture in his non-shooting hand. He was injured during their previous game in San Antonio when he collided with LaMarcus Aldridge as the Spurs' big man set a screen. ""I got word at halftime that surgery went well,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""We're going to have to find other guys to step up, especially off the bench."" Boston trailed by two before going on an 11-2 spurt over a 1:32 stretch to move ahead 101-94 with 4:11 to play on Walker's 3 from the right wing. Smart then converted a three-point play. Walker nailed his three big shots from beyond the arc in a span of 1:09. Dallas took its first lead, 88-86, on Tim Hardaway Jr.'s one-handed runner in the lane. The Mavericks held a 92-90 edge before Walker took over. The teams were tied at halftime before Boston opened the second half with a 15-3 surge. Smart started the run with a 3 from the right corner. Walker and Brown added 3s on consecutive possessions. Doncic then started to take over, scoring nine of the Mavericks' 11 points as they closed to 84-79 at the end of the third quarter. TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis didn't play in Dallas' previous game, resting as he returns from left knee surgery that sidelined him for the entire 2018-19 season. ""He was (struggling), but you know this is what happens to great players,"" Doncic said. ""They have a bad night. So expect, I think, the next game he's going to have at least 30 points. He keeps working. He just came back from injury."" Celtics: C Enes Kanter returned after missing seven games with a bruised left knee. ""I felt it a little bit,"" he said when asked if he was fatigued during his nearly six minutes in the game. . Theis injured his right pinkie and went to the locker room early in the game. He came back to the bench and had the pinkie taped to his ring finger before going back in.

"NEW ORLEANS --  As usual, scoring comes in concentrated bursts for James Harden. Harden scored 19 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter and the Houston Rockets beat the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 122-116 Monday night. The NBA's leading scorer has averaged 40.6 points in his last eight games, but missed nine of his first 10 3-point shots. Still, with Houston leading by four midway through the fourth quarter, Harden lit his personal fuse and scored 13 consecutive points in a 1:57 span to push the advantage to 110-93. ""I wasn't really getting to the rim,"" Harden said. ""The first three quarters I was settling and kind of just being passive. So, I just wanted to be more aggressive, whether it was shooting my shot or getting to the basket."" Russell Westbrook had 26 points and Clint Capela added 11 points and 20 rebounds to help the Rockets to their fourth straight win. JJ Redick had 24 points, Josh Hart scored 19, and Jrue Holiday added 18 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds for New Orleans, which played without leading-scorer Brandon Ingram due to a sore right knee. The Pelicans could not overcome 12 first-half turnovers -- six by Holiday in the first half alone -- and 29% shooting from 3-point range in the fourth quarter. ""We've just got to start valuing the basketball and we've got to stop making the bad turnover,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You shoot 45 threes -- you've got to make more than 14 of them."" The Rockets led 95-82 early in the fourth quarter on Westbrook's dunk, but the Pelicans pulled to 97-93 on a four-point play by Redick. Harden then took control with his scoring burst. ""It's go time,"" Harden said. ""The fourth quarter is winning time, so you've got to be more aggressive and make plays whenever they come to you, whether it's my shot or getting to the basket, shooting my floater or making the right play."" He started the run by splitting defenders for driving layups on consecutive possessions and then made back-to-back 3-pointers, including one for a four-point play. By the time Harden made two free throws to end the run, Houston led by 17 with 5:20 left. ""It's what he does,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It shouldn't have been (just a four-point lead). We have to close games out. We have to play better. We have to play smart, and tonight I didn't think we did. Good enough to win? OK, but that's not what we want to be."" The Rockets committed 17 turnovers and shot just 29.3% from the perimeter (12 of 41). Harden and Westbrook missing 14 of their first 16 attempts on 3-pointers, and finished a combined 4 for 19 from long range. But they did enough with mid-range jumpers and layups. The Rockets built a 42-31 lead midway through the second quarter, but the Pelicans used an 18-9 run, with eight points coming from Hart, to trim the deficit to 51-49. Despite shooting just 4 for 19 from 3-point range, Houston led 58-52 at the half. Harden struggled early from long range, missing his first four shots. The Pelicans stayed within striking distance on the strength of Redick's 3-point shooting (4 of 6) for 12 first-half points. Harden's first 3 of the game put Houston up 68-57, but New Orleans went on a 17-7 spurt, with seven points by E'Twaun Moore, to cut it to 75-74. The Rockets closed the quarter by outscoring the Pelicans 15-8 to lead 90-82 after three.

""Russell is an MVP for a reason,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's one of the best players in the league. You have to let him go. He'll figure it out."" MIXED BAGGAGE In addition to his near triple-double and six turnovers, Holiday shot 0 for 7 on 3-pointers. ""Just keep pushing,"" he said. ""I feel that everybody just goes through slumps. Not shooting efficiently, missing easy buckets to the rim, my 3-point shot not falling. . I can produce in other ways.""","401160784"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Jaren Jackson Jr.'s inconsistency has mirrored that of the Memphis Grizzlies. Jackson put together his best all-around performance Monday night and it resulted in Memphis' most satisfying victory and first road win. Jackson had 24 points and the Grizzlies put a damper on Tony Parker's jersey retirement by beating the San Antonio Spurs 113-109 Monday night. After averaging 44 points and committing 14 fouls in his previous four games, Jackson had six rebounds, five assists, one block and just two personal fouls in 38 minutes against the Spurs. ""He's getting comfortable, his confidence is back,"" Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant said. ""He's just playing with that bop, not thinking too much. We're going to tell him to just hoop."" Jackson was involved in two pivotal plays with the Grizzlies up 111-109 in the final minute. His 3-pointer with 25.5 seconds was overturned when replays determined the Grizzlies forward was out of bounds. Jackson then blocked DeMar DeRozan's ensuing drive to maintain Memphis' two-point advantage. Memphis won a coach's challenge that overturned a foul that would have put DeRozan on the line with San Antonio trailing 113-109. Dillon Brooks had 21 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 18 points and 12 rebounds for Memphis, which had lost two straight and five of six. ""I'm proud of them,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We've tried to address the last couple of days that's not our standard. How we've got to compete the right way, play together the right way and this is what we're capable of."" San Antonio needed a fevered comeback to overcome another sluggish performance on the heels of a 135-115 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday. It was a strange performance given the circumstances. Parker's uniform was lifted to the rafters alongside fellow Big Three members Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili following the game. That group led San Antonio to four of its five championships and have the most wins (541) of any trio in league history. That success seems like a distant memory as the Spurs (5-5) suffered their second straight loss and fourth defeat in five games. The sold-out crowd came in buzzing, but the Spurs didn't give them much to cheer for. San Antonio shot 33 percent in falling behind 35-22 in the first quarter. ""We've got to show some type of urgency, understanding,"" DeRozan said. ""We can't wait until late in the game to try to make something happen, try to make a defensive play. We've got to be consistent from the beginning of the game."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 19 points, Rudy Gay added 18 and DeRozan had 12 for San Antonio. Memphis took advantage, attacking the basket continually in building a 16-point lead in the first half behind 22 points in the paint and 51% shooting. WELCOME HOME The Spurs welcomed back former players Ginobili, Boris Diaw, Michael Finley, Ian Mahinmi and former assistants Mike Budenholzer, Ime Udoka and James Borrego for Parker's jersey retirement along with Parker's former France National Team members Nicolas Batum and Ronny Turiaf. A few bats crashed the party, buzzing the court minutes prior to and during Parker's retirement ceremony. Two stadium workers attempted to corral them with nets but the crowd chanted, ""Manu"" in hopes Ginobili would repeat his 2017 performance when he swatted one down. Ginobili rolled up his sleeves and feigned getting up but instead laughed and remained seated as the bats flew up to the rafters. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Former Spurs forward Kyle Anderson had three points, three rebounds and two assists in 18 minutes off the bench. ... Memphis is 39-8 against the Spurs in San Antonio. Spurs: Derrick White continued to ride a stationary bike to stay loose when he wasn't in the game. White is still feeling the effects of hard fall on his backside against the Lakers on Nov. 3. ... In addition to their Big Three, the Spurs have retired the jerseys of James Silas, George Gervin, Johnny Moore, David Robinson, Sean Elliott, Avery Johnson and Bruce Bowen.","401160785"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz showed they can be a dangerous team from beyond the arc. Mitchell and Mike Conley each hit five 3-pointers as the Jazz shot 56 percent (15 for 27) from deep over the first three quarters to take command in a 122-108 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Utah entered averaging 29.3 attempts per game from 3-point range, fifth-fewest in the NBA. ""We're a team that we want to be able to shoot 3s and make 3s at a high clip,"" Conley said. ""We've got a lot of guys who can do it."" Rudy Gobert had 25 points and 14 rebounds to power the Jazz inside, but it was their perimeter shooting that made the difference every time the Warriors threatened a comeback. Mitchell added 23 points and Conley scored 22 for Utah, which improved to 7-3. The injury-ravaged Warriors fell to an NBA-worst 2-9, and their frustrations boiled over in the fourth quarter. Draymond Green, back after missing five games with a torn finger ligament, earned back-to-back technicals and an ejection for arguing a blocking call with 8:28 left. ""I disagreed with that call, and I'm never going to be OK with another grown man telling me don't talk,"" Green said. ""If you feel like you got the call wrong, or right, you don't tell me not to talk. I'm a grown man."" Less than a minute later, coach Steve Kerr was given a technical after arguing a kicked-ball call against Jordan Poole. It's been that kind of season so far for the Warriors, who had their biggest star back in the building Monday. Stephen Curry, sidelined for at least the next three months because of a broken left hand, held a pregame media briefing to discuss his injury and try to lend his teammates some moral support. Point guard D'Angelo Russell continues to be a bright spot for Golden State. He scored 33 points, his fourth consecutive game of 30 or more. Green pointed out it's a different offense the Warriors are running than before he was injured. With Curry out, Kerr is putting the ball in Russell's hands, which means more pick-and-rolls and less rapid-fire passing. ""I don't really have the ball in my hands. I've always been a playmaker. I don't really have the ball much,"" Green said. ""It's just (something) to figure out. It's not the first time in my career I've had to figure something out."" Kerr agreed it's an adjustment for Green, whose slick passing always has been a staple of the Warriors' offense. ""It's kind of a strange case where the guy who's been here the longest is the newest with what we're doing,"" Kerr said. TIP-INS Jazz: Entered the night with the NBA's 28th-ranked offense at 101 points per game. ... Finished 16 for 35 (46 percent) from 3-point range and went 26 of 32 at the foul line. ... Utah, which is 5-0 at home, improved to 2/3 on the road. Warriors: Green's return to the lineup was a welcome sign, but his presence was felt even before the opening tip. ""We already felt it this morning in shootaround, just his voice,"" Kerr said. ... Golden State also welcomed back rookie forward Eric Paschall, who missed Saturday's game at Oklahoma City with a bruised hip. Paschall, who averaged 22.5 points in the four games leading up to his injury, finished with eight. JERSEY EXCHANGE Paschall and Mitchell, AAU teammates in Harlem, New York, during their younger days, exchanged jerseys after the game. ""I'll probably hang it up,"" Paschall said. ""Just to be able to switch jerseys with him is so special. I know our families are very happy and very blessed that we're in a position to do this."" KERR REFLECTS Kerr began his pregame media briefing by sending condolences to the family of Bernard Tyson, the CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente who died Sunday at age 60. ""He was a wonderful man, someone who made a huge impact here in the Bay Area, the community and with our team,"" Kerr said.","401160786"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard wasn't at his best against his former team. His new teammates knocked down big shots and won anyway. Leonard struggled on 2-for-11 shooting and had nine turnovers, but Lou Williams led a big effort from the bench with 21 points and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors 98-88 on Monday night. Leonard finished with 12 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists to go with those nine turnovers, prompting Clippers coach Doc Rivers to joke about ""almost a quadruple-double."" Throughout the game, Leonard faced plenty of double coverage. ""As soon as I walked across half-court they tried to get the ball out of my hands,"" he said. ""They did a great job on me defending and sending an extra body. It got me better and it's going to get my teammates better."" Last season, Leonard led the Raptors to their first championship, averaging 30.5 points and 9.1 rebounds in 24 postseason games to earn his second Finals MVP award. ""I had a great time there. It's the next chapter now. I can't live in the past,"" he said. ""I'm with a different team and they want to have that same feeling."" The Clippers shot just 37% but dominated the boards 66-38, led by 12 each from Patrick Beverley and JaMychal Green. Los Angeles' bench outscored Toronto's reserves 56-35, with Montrezl Harrell adding 14 points and 11 rebounds and Green posting 10 points and 12 rebounds. Leonard's first five points all came on free throws, including two technicals. He missed his first six field goal attempts and finally scored on a coast-to-coast layup midway through the third quarter to put the Clippers up 62-55. From there, the Raptors outscored Los Angles 23-11 the rest of the period. Pascal Siakam had seven points and Fred VanVleet added five in the spurt as neither team led by more than two until Matt Thomas' 3-pointer and basket sent the Raptors into the fourth leading 78-73. ""It's just fun, just be able to compete against guys who you were with last year,"" Leonard said. ""It's a little bit more competitive because you do talk to them."" Not much, though. ""Maybe whispered a little bit to him here or there about missing a free throw,"" Fred VanVleet said, ""but it didn't work."" Siakam had 16 points and 10 rebounds, Norman Powell added 15 points and VanVleet had 14 points for the injury-depleted Raptors, who had their three-game winning streak snapped in the second game of a back-to-back after beating the Lakers on Sunday. ""That's a hell of a team to play on a back-to-back short-handed,"" VanVleet said. ""Just kind of ran ourselves into the mud and give those guys credit, they closed it out."" VanVleet was 1 for 7 in the fourth after notching three double-doubles in his previous five games. Toronto was 4 of 24 from the floor in a fourth quarter that featured a series of mad dashes and bodies piled in the paint on both ends. The Raptors tied the game for the last time at 82 on Chris Boucher's 3-pointer. They managed just three field goals the rest of the way. ""Our guys played their guts out. We totally outplayed them,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We were playing harder, executing better, creating a lot of problems for them but just not quite enough."" IN YOUR EYE Raptors starting forward OG Anunoby got poked in the right eye by Leonard while scrambling for a rebound two minutes into the game and didn't return. Anunoby's eye was patched after the game and he'll see a doctor on Tuesday. Nurse was asked about Anunoby getting called for a foul on the play. ""The guy lost both his contacts and cut his eye open with blood,"" he said. ""Are you kidding me?"" Leonard said he would text Anunoby to see how he's doing. HE SAID IT ""I could complain about officiating if you guys want to pitch into the fine pool."" -- VanVleet to reporters. TIP-INS Raptors: They were without G Kyle Lowry (broken left thumb) and F/C Serge Ibaka (right ankle sprain), who both got hurt Friday at New Orleans. Lowry will be re-evaluated in two weeks, while Ibaka is out indefinitely. Clippers: Starting G Landry Shamet went down near the baseline late in the third and had to be helped off the court after spraining his ankle. He was on crutches afterward. ... Los Angeles improved to 6-1 at home. HONORING GEORGE Paul George had his No. 24 jersey retired at Fresno State, where Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and some of his current teammates surprised him. George was honored at halftime of Sunday's 77-74 victory over Winthrop in front of 8,529 fans. He and former Bulldogs coach Jerry Tarkanian are the only basketball jerseys to be retired by the school, where George played from 2008-10 before leaving early for the NBA draft.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  T.J. Warren was in attack mode to start the second half. Warren scored 11 of his 23 points in the third quarter to lead the Indiana Pacers over the Oklahoma City Thunder 111-85 Tuesday night. ""I just wanted to come out with a high sense of urgency out there,"" he said. ""I know we had a good little lead and we just wanted to put them away in the third. I just wanted to be aggressive and attack."" Malcolm Brogdon had 20 points, six rebounds and five assists, and Domantas Sabonis had 18 points and 16 rebounds for the surging Pacers (7-4), who have won seven of eight, including four straight. It was Warren who provided the spark needed to put the game out of reach, shooting 5 for 5 from the field in the third quarter and 10 for 14 overall. As one of nine additions to Indiana's roster this season, Warren is beginning to find a groove. ""It's a new group,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Part of it is figuring these guys out, where they like the ball, what they can do with the basketball. We're starting to personalize some of the sets in the offense, spotting where guys can be effective and productive."" The Pacers used a big third quarter -- including 71.4 percent shooting -- to take a 26-point lead and put the game away. Aaron Holiday hit two 3-pointers and Warren made another in a 15-2 run that ended with Doug McDermott's layup to put Indiana ahead 84-58 with 1:49 to go. McDermott hit a 3-pointer to make it 99-68 with 7:19 to play. Danilo Gallinari scored 14 points, Deonte Burton had 13 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 11 points and six rebounds for the Thunder (4-7), who have lost three of four and remained winless on the road. ""We definitely struggled on offense,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""It was 10 at the half and we talked about that coming out of the half. Warren really got going in that stretch and then their whole team kind of got going."" The Pacers first pulled away with a 12-2 run in the first quarter. TJ Leaf's layup gave Indiana a 28-18 lead, and the Pacers led by 15 after a jumper by Brogdon made it 52-37 with 1:58 remaining in the half. The Thunder scored five straight points, including a 3-pointer by Gilgeous-Alexander, to close out the first half. The Pacers led 52-42 at halftime. SUCCESS AT THE LINE The Pacers were 10 for 10 from the foul line through the first three quarters and finished 12 for 13 overall. The Thunder were 19 for 20 after three quarters, finishing 21 for 24 from the line. Gallinari shot a perfect 8 for 8 on free throws. OLADIPO PROGRESSING IN REHAB Victor Oladipo was assigned to Indiana's G League affiliate in Fort Wayne for a brief period Tuesday. The two-time All-Star was then recalled following a practice with the Mad Ants in Indianapolis, where Oladipo participated in full court drills for the first time, according to McMillan.

"PHILADELPHIA --  The shots weren't falling for the Philadelphia 76ers, so they clamped down on defense. Joel Embiid scored 27 points, including the go-ahead dunk with 13.2 seconds remaining, and Philadelphia held Cleveland without a point for the final 3  1/2 minutes in a 98-97 win over the Cavaliers on Tuesday night. Josh Richardson added 17 points and Ben Simmons had 15 for Philadelphia, which won despite missing 30 of 38 3-point attempts. Tobias Harris missed all 11 of his 3-point tries. ""You better guard if you're not going to make shots,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We knew if we were going to do anything, we had to play defense -- and defense we played."" Jordan Clarkson and Kevin Love each had 20 points to pace Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 18 points and Tristan Thompson had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers trailed for most of the contest, but took advantage of Philadelphia's poor shooting in the fourth quarter, going up by as many as five points on three occasions. ""We gave them life and were in a fistfight,"" Brown said. ""You can just feel it. We had a chance to discourage them and we didn't. Certainly a hard-fought game and we're lucky to get away with it."" Cleveland led 97-92 with 3:34 remaining after Sexton's driving layup, but the Cavaliers wouldn't score again. Harris pulled Philadelphia within 97-94 with a follow layup and then hit a 17-footer on the ensuing possession to make it a one-point game with 1:42 left. Cleveland had chances to build the lead after that, but Love missed a close-range shot before a shot-clock violation on the Cavaliers' next possession. ""I think our defense was pretty OK,"" Embiid said. ""We just didn't make shots."" The 76ers were having their own trouble scoring with Richardson and Embiid failing to convert on consecutive possessions. After a timeout with 26.6 seconds left, Brown called a high-percentage play with Harris finding Embiid close to the basket. Embiid slammed it home to give the 76ers their first lead, 98-97, since early in the fourth quarter. ""It was a great play-call by coach and we did the rest,"" Embiid said. Cleveland had a chance to win it, but Love's 3-point attempt from the top of the key rimmed out. ""Kevin is a great shooter, not a good shooter,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""He took his time but just didn't nail it. It's one of many looks I'll take at that time."" CLOSE CALLS Four of Philadelphia's seven wins have been by eight points or less. Asked if the 76ers were playing with fire by winning such close games, Brown said, ""It's a blow torch. It is violent."" ""I, sadistically, love it,"" he added. BEN'S BACK Simmons returned after missing two games due to a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. He added six assists, five rebounds and two blocks to his point total, but also had four turnovers in 35 minutes. He made 7 of 9 field goals with all but a 6-foot turnaround jumper from close range. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Porter Jr. returned in the second half after appearing to injure his hip early in the second quarter. Porter finished with four points. . John Henson (hamstring) and Ante Zizic (foot) sat out. 76ers: Al Horford (rest), Shake Milton (knee) and Trey Burke (left calf) didn't play. . Philadelphia missed its first eight 3-pointers before Embiid connected from long range with 1:49 left in the first quarter. The 76ers finished the first period 1 for 11 from the arc, with Harris missing all five of his 3-point attempts. . The 76ers finished the first half going 3 for 20 from 3-point range, but led 54-48.","401160789"
"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler knows this Miami Heat team can get much better. That being said, he's quite happy with the start. Butler scored 11 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, added 13 assists and the Miami Heat wasted most of what was a 29-point lead before hanging on to beat the shorthanded Detroit Pistons 117-108 on Tuesday night. ""We want it to be tough to come here and play,"" Butler said. ""We don't want people to come here and want to play the Miami Heat. We don't want people to want to play the Miami Heat, home or away."" Kendrick Nunn also had 20 for Miami, while Bam Adebayo scored 18 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the Heat. Goran Dragic also had 18 points for the Heat (7-3), who matched the third-best 10-game start in Heat history. Butler's 13-assist, zero-turnover game was the fifth in Heat history and the first since Dwyane Wade had one in 2009. Luke Kennard was 0 for 7 in the first half, but recovered to score 22 for Detroit. Andre Drummond had 16 points and nine rebounds before fouling out, and Christian Wood added 16 for the Pistons -- who never led, but made the second half plenty interesting by getting as close as seven late. ""NBA basketball games are long,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And you have to play all the way through to the end. ... But these are good experiences for our team."" Detroit held Blake Griffin (hamstring, knee) and Derrick Rose (hamstring) out, not wanting to play either on a back-to-back after both played Monday. That wasn't the Pistons' only issue. Record snow -- Detroit's biggest November storm ever, according to the National Weather Service, with 9.2 inches as the official mark and some suburbs reporting more than a foot -- made just getting to Miami a problem for the Pistons, who played Monday night at home and then were hoping to be airborne sometime in the 11 p.m. hour. The Pistons didn't leave their airport gate in Detroit until 2:40 a.m., got in the air 10 minutes later and were at their gate at Miami International Airport at 5:34 a.m. That was more than four hours behind their intended schedule. ""Whether we got in at 11 o'clock last night or 5 o'clock this morning, we've got to have that type of toughness and that type of resilience versus adversity that we haven't exhibited so far this year,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. He saw plenty of that. Detroit got down by as many as 29 in the first half, going into the break trailing 59-37. The Pistons got it down to 13 in the third, only to see Miami push the margin back out to 20 entering the fourth. Miami's lead was 15 when Drummond fouled out early in the fourth and it still wasn't over. Kennard made a 3-pointer with about 2 minutes left to get the Pistons within 111-103, but the Heat escaped. ""They came out ready to go from the jump and we were relaxing and let them punch us in the face,"" Pistons guard Bruce Brown said. TIP-INS Pistons: The 22-point halftime deficit was the second-largest Detroit has ever faced against Miami. The Pistons trailed the Heat 59-36 at the break of a game in 2012. .. Detroit came into the night shooting a league-best 41% from 3-point range. The Pistons shot 15 of 41 from deep on Tuesday. Heat: The 1999-2000 and 2011-12 Heat teams were 8-2. There have been eight others to start 7-3, the most recent before now being 2013-14. ... Meyers Leonard has started all 10 games this season, the first time he's had that long a starting streak in his career.

Miami was without Justise Winslow (concussion), James Johnson (sick), Tyler Herro (ankle), Derrick Jones Jr. (hip), KZ Okpala (Achilles) and Dion Waiters (suspended). HOME COOKING The Heat are 4-0 at home for the first time since 2012-13. They haven't trailed at home at any point in their last 11-1/2 quarters, going back to a 10-9 deficit against Atlanta -- a total of 136 minutes, 9 seconds.","401160790"
"CHICAGO --  Coby White waited as Roy Williams walked up the court. Williams playfully bowed in front of his former guard and then gave him a hug before taking off. It was White's night, and a beaming Williams loved every moment. White made a franchise-record seven 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, and the Chicago Bulls pulled away from the slumping New York Knicks for a 120-102 victory Tuesday. ""I had been shooting it bad, so it was good to see that first one fall,"" White said. ""Then I just got into a good rhythm."" No kidding. White missed his first five shots from the field and began the final period with just four points. But the 19-year-old rookie put on a dazzling show down the stretch, delighting a United Center crowd that included Williams, White's coach at the University of North Carolina. White and Williams talked before the win. White had been struggling with his shot, and Williams told him to just be himself. ""Just told me if I be Coby, then everything will take care of itself,"" White said. Worked out quite well for the Bulls. White connected from deep on three straight Chicago possessions during a 24-2 run that made it 109-89 with 5:51 remaining. Backed by chants of ""Co-by! Co-by!"" he made one last 3 to run the Bulls' lead out to 120-100 before checking out with 1:31 to go. ""The kid is just a super talent,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""He's got incredible speed, so you have respect it. Once he gets it going, it's hard to stop. He just broke the game open."" White finished with 27 points. Zach LaVine had 25 for Chicago, and Wendell Carter Jr. finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds. New York lost for the sixth time in seven games. Marcus Morris scored 22 points for the Knicks, and rookie RJ Barrett finished with 21 points and nine assists. ""This one was tough,"" Barrett said. ""When a guy hits seven 3s in the fourth quarter, it's kind of tough. But we played three great quarters of basketball and we've just got to finish it off in the fourth."" Barrett played his college ball at Duke, where he faced White in Atlantic Coast Conference action. ""I've seen that before,"" he said. ""He's gonna make shots, he makes tough shots. That's the kind of player he is."" It was New York's first game since team president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry expressed concern about the Knicks' level of play following an embarrassing 108-87 home loss against Cleveland on Sunday night. New York rallied for a 105-98 victory over Chicago in their first meeting of the season on Oct. 28. Bobby Portis led the way with 28 points and 11 rebounds against his former team, but he finished with just seven points in the rematch. WORTH WATCHING Chicago's Lauri Markkanen is playing with a sore oblique, but coach Jim Boylen said the third-year power forward insists it's not limiting his play on offense. The 22-year-old Markkanen was shooting just 38.5% from the field heading into the matchup with the Knicks. ""He's trying to play through whatever he has and not use it as an excuse,"" Boylen said. ""I think that's big time and I think that's what we need."" TIP-INS Knicks: Taj Gibson and Julius Randle each scored 17 points. ...

"DENVER --  Falling into a 12-0 hole less than three minutes in brought back unpleasant memories for the Atlanta Hawks. Trae Young rewrote the ending with another big game. The second-year point guard scored 15 of his season-high 42 points in the fourth quarter and added 11 assists to lead Atlanta over the Denver Nuggets 125-121 on Tuesday night. Young finished seven points shy of his career high set March 1 against Chicago last season. He was 13 of 21 from the field and finished 8 for 13 on 3-pointers to flip the script on the Hawks' last visit to Denver. The Nuggets scored the first 13 points on their way to a 45-point rout of Atlanta last November, but this time the Hawks pushed back. ""We didn't want the same thing to happen again,"" Young said. ""We wanted to get back rolling."" Jabari Parker had 20 points and nine rebounds, and Alex Len scored 17 for the Hawks, who played most of the second half without guard Kevin Huerter. Huerter was hurt when he was fouled by Nikola Jokic with 9:57 remaining in the third quarter. Jokic slapped down on his arm as Huerter was starting to go up with the ball and he immediately grabbed his left arm. He was holding the arm against his body as he walked to the locker room. Huerter was ruled out for the game later in the period. ""He had a hot start and with him going down it was tough,"" Young said. Will Barton led Denver with 21 points, Jokic had 20 and Paul Millsap added 19. The Nuggets had their three-game winning streak snapped. The main reason was Young, who has bounced back from scoring nine points against Chicago last week to eclipse the 30-point mark in three straight games. ""It was just the Trae Young show for 48 minutes,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. Young, who had 17 points in the first half, shouldered the load on offense after Huerter left. Young put up 10 points in the third and then carried the Hawks in the fourth, scoring more than half of their 27 points. ""It felt better because we won,"" Young said. ""I'm glad I was able to knock some shots down and help us win."" Denver rallied early in the fourth to tie it at 101 but Young hit a pair of 3-pointers and a floater to put Atlanta ahead 114-106. The Nuggets couldn't get closer than four the rest of the way. ""He's got an ultra green light,"" Denver guard Gary Harris said. ""He's capable of pulling up right after half court. It makes it tough to guard."" Atlanta trailed by nine after one but outscored Denver 38-20 in the second to take a 63-54 lead at halftime. The Hawks increased their lead to 13 in the third. TIP-INS Hawks: F Allen Crabbe (knee) was dressed but coach Lloyd Pierce didn't want to use him. ""He's still in the emergency situation. We needed a body to dress,"" Pierce said. ... Atlanta shot 68 percent (15 of 22) in the second quarter. Nuggets: G Malik Beasley was inactive due to illness. He sat out the second half of Sunday's win at Minnesota. ... The 38 points allowed in the second quarter and the 63 points in the first half were the most Denver has given up. CROWD CONTROL Young helped stave off a third-quarter rally by Denver when he drained a 3-pointer in front of the Nuggets bench. He then turned and stared into the seats before running up the court. ""Some of it was the bench but some of it was to one of the dudes in the crowd,"" Young said. ""I'm not about to get fined talking about it. Sometimes what the fans say is unacceptable. I can't say nothing to him, I can't do anything towards him, I can just get buckets and look at him. ""He stopped talking as much."" FINDING FAULT Pierce was happy with most of Young's performance but thought the guard could have done better. ""I wasn't impressed with his free throws. He went 8 for 11; he's got to go 11 for 11,"" Pierce said. ""He missed two the other night, he missed three tonight. It's always something. Everybody else can praise him -- I've got to stay on him.""","401160792"
"LeBron James reacts to Kyle Kuzma's big game in the Lakers' win vs. the Suns and how Kuzma's success will benefit the team moving forward. (0:41) PHOENIX --  Kyle Kuzma was out on the floor in the crucial final minutes on Tuesday night when his teammates made the extra pass and found him at the 3-point line. Both times, he never hesitated to take the shots that splashed through the net and pushed the Lakers to a 123-115 over the Phoenix Suns. Nobody looked happier than Anthony Davis and LeBron James. They'll take all the help they can get. ""Welcome back,"" Davis said they told Kuzma. Davis had 24 points and 12 rebounds and Kuzma added a season-high 23 points on 9 of 16 shooting to push the Lakers (8-2) to their best 10-game start since 2010 and bounce back from a home loss to Toronto on Sunday. James added 19 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds. Phoenix (6-4) trailed for a big chunk of the fourth quarter but pushed ahead 113-111 on Devin Booker's fastbreak layup with 3:29 left. The Lakers responded with three straight 3-pointers -- one from James and two more from Kuzma -- to lead 120-113 and put the game out of reach. Kuzma missed the first four games of the season this year because of an ankle injury he suffered during the summer while playing for USA basketball. He averaged 18.7 points last season but was scoring just over 10 per game until Tuesday's outburst. ""I've just got teammates who believe in me,"" Kuzma said. ""We all believe in each other. We're a team and we pick each other up."" Los Angeles dominated in the paint with 70 points. Dwight Howard came off the bench to score 12 points and grab nine rebounds in 20 minutes. The Lakers had 39 assists on 51 made field goals. ""That is the secret for us,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""If you truly commit to the extra pass offensively and playing for each other, we are going to be near unbeatable. That was a really good team we beat tonight -- that's a really good win."" The Suns were led by Ricky Rubio and Booker, who both scored 21 points. Aron Baynes added 20 and Dario Saric had 18. ""Down the stretch we have to be better,"" Booker said. ""Rebound better, execute better. We didn't do that tonight. Davis scored 14 points as the Lakers took a 60-58 halftime lead. James added nine points and eight assists. CLOSE GAME The Lakers' 3-point barrage in the final minutes ended a very close game for most of the night. Neither team ever led by double figures and there were 29 lead changes and 14 ties. According to the Elias Sports Bureau that was the most lead changes in a Suns game since 2009. HURTING DAVIS Davis had another productive game despite taking ""a shot"" to the ribs during the first quarter. He went to the locker room to get it wrapped, but quickly returned and shot 9 of 17 from the field. Davis said he wasn't sure if he'd play against Golden State, which is a quick turnaround on Wednesday. The 6-foot-10 forward said he would see how his body responded in the morning. ""I just want to play,"" Davis said. ""It's tough for me to lead from the sideline."" TOUGH NIGHT Phoenix's Kelly Oubre Jr. had a rough night, scoring just one point in 19 minutes. He shot 0 of 5 from the field, including 0 of 4 from 3-point range. The bad shooting night snapped a career-high streak of scoring in double figures for 22 consecutive games. EFFICIENT BOOKER Booker came into the game shooting 54.5% from the field, 53.2% on 3-pointers and 92.3% on free throws. He's still on his 50/50/90 pace after shooting 9 of 18 from the field against the Lakers. He also had nine assists on Tuesday.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah survived a sluggish start by putting together a dominant finish against Brooklyn. The Jazz clamped down defensively during critical stretches in the fourth quarter of a 119-114 win over the Nets on Tuesday night. Utah allowed a single basket over the final three minutes and pushed the pace on offense just enough to pull ahead for good in the last minute. It ultimately helped the Jazz complete a rally from a 15-point deficit. ""They came out and they hit us first, but we came in and understood what we needed to do,"" Mitchell said. ""We picked it up on the defensive end and made it tougher on them and we were able to get stops and then run."" Mitchell scored 30 points to lead Utah. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 15 rebounds. Mike Conley also chipped in 18 points. Utah went ahead for good after Gobert scored on back-to-back possessions in the final 90 seconds. Gobert's second basket, a dunk, gave the Jazz a 116-114 lead with 55.6 seconds remaining. Irving missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 7.6 seconds left. Conley and Mitchell hit 3-of-4 free throws in the final seconds to close it out. ""They made some hustle plays, of course, off my misses down the stretch,"" Irving said. ""We had a good chance down the stretch, a good look at the rim from the 3-point line . but things happen in the basketball world, you just gotta live with it."" Irving finished with 27 points to lead Brooklyn. Spencer Dinwiddie added 21 points off the bench. DeAndre Jordan added 15 points and a season-high 17 rebounds. The Jazz looked flat taking the court after playing on the road at Golden State the night before. Brooklyn took advantage and built a double-digit lead before halftime. Jarrett Allen made two free throws and scored on a second-chance dunk to cap a 19-7 run that gave the Nets a 55-43 lead late in the second quarter. Brooklyn led 68-53 when Prince and Irving made back-to-back baskets in the final minute before halftime. ""We weren't defending the way that we could and also we were sluggish offensively,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We just had to be sharper mentally."" Utah roared to life in the third. The Jazz opened the quarter on a 13-0 run. Conley stole the ball and fed it to Bogdanovic for a layup to cap the run and cut Brooklyn's lead to 68-66. The Nets went four minutes without making a field goal before Irving broke the drought with back-to-back baskets. Brooklyn appeared on the verge of pulling away when Jordan sank two free throws to help the Nets go ahead 92-84 heading into the fourth quarter. Green and Mudiay combined for six straight baskets to open the quarter and pushed Utah to a 103-98 lead with 7:52 left. Mudiay finished with 15 points and Jeff Green added 13. 19 of their 28 points came early in the fourth quarter. ""I thought we had two bad stretches: the beginning of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Those are the two bad stretches and against an excellent team, our margin is very small, especially on the road."" GETTING DEFENSIVE Utah attacked Irving defensively by rotating between Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles onto him. O'Neale guarded the Nets point guard to start the game and Ingles took over down the stretch. They were able to limit him to 10-of-30 shooting -- including just 2-of-12 from the perimeter. Irving went 2-of-11 from the field in the fourth quarter and didn't make a basket over the final seven minutes. ""I felt like I had some great looks at the 3-point line,"" he said. ""The whole night, I just felt like I had some great looks. I'm gonna shoot it better. If I make `em, it's a different story."" QUICK TURNAROUND Utah took the court less than 24 hours after earning a road win against the Warriors. The Jazz didn't arrive in Salt Lake until 4 am and the fatigue was evident in the early part of the game. By halftime, Utah was shooting just 40% from the field and was 1-of-13 from 3-point range. In the second half, the Jazz shot 53% from the field and went 5-of-13 from outside. ""It took us a while to wake up,"" Conley said. ""We did a good job of handling it and it was just a good overall win despite everything else."" TIP INS Nets: Caris LaVert sat out with a sprained right thumb. ... Jordan dished out a season-high four assists. He also had 12 defensive rebounds, the most of any Nets player in a single game this season.  ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  After a slow and sluggish start in their first game without leading scorer De'Aaron Fox, Sacramento eventually found a nice rhythm with Bogdan Bogdanovic running the offense. Luke Walton was even more impressed with his team's defense, something that's been an ongoing issue for the Kings. Bogdanovic had 25 points and 10 assists, Nemanja Bjelica added 19 points and 12 rebounds and the Kings won in their first game since losing leading scorer Fox to an ankle injury, beating the slumping Portland Trail Blazers 107-99 on Tuesday night. Sacramento forced 17 turnovers and prevented Portland's potent backcourt tandem of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum from taking over. ""It's what we've been preaching about every day since Day 1 of training camp,"" Walton said. ""I'll be the first to admit it needs to get a lot better. We started the game, we couldn't make anything. That's why defense is important. Every night won't go like that but the competitive level that we played with on the defensive end tonight, that needs to be a steady constant for us."" The Kings overcame a sloppy first half when they shot 36.7 percent, made a big run in the third quarter, then pulled away in the fourth to end a two-game losing streak to the Blazers. Fox suffered a Grade 3 sprain in his left ankle during practice Monday. The third-year point guard, who started 81 games last season, will be reevaluated in a few weeks. ""Ankle sprains happen a lot in the NBA. But it is unfortunate that it is as severe as it is,"" Walton said. ""What's important is that our team comes together, grows, fights, and gets better. And he attacks his rehab and get back with us as soon as he can."" Bjelica helped make up for the loss of Fox. He made eight of his 14 shots and set a season-high for rebounds in his first double-double of the season. Buddy Hield added 20 points. Lillard had 27 points and McCollum added 24 for the Blazers (4-7), who have lost five of six. Nearly half of Lillard's points (13) came at the free throw line. ""The third quarter got away from us defensively and we had some trouble with matchups,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""They got off to a good start in the third quarter and built a lead. We really couldn't recover after that."" The Kings led by 14 early in the fourth quarter before the Blazers chipped away and pulled within 98-93 on a 3-pointer from Anfernee Simons with 2:51 remaining. Bjelica answered with a 3, and after McCollum scored for Portland, Cory Joseph added a 3-pointer that made it 104-95. Joseph, starting in place of Fox, missed his first five shots before that. ""We kept fighting, played great defense and we knew we were going to make shots in the second half,"" Bjelica said. ""Everybody played well."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland missed 11 of its first 15 shots outside the arc. ... Whiteside went to the bench with his third foul 6  1/2 minutes into the first quarter. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Ja Morants winning layup left the rookie flexing and shouting at the crowd and sent father Tee racing down the sideline while pumping his knees high in the air, filled with excitement over his sons big moment. Yep, Morants homecoming game went about as well as he could have hoped. With his parents sitting courtside and nearly 100 friends in the stands, Morant scored on a driving left-handed layup with 0.7 seconds left to give the Memphis Grizzlies 119-117 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. The South Carolina native had his first double-double with 23 points and 11 assists to help the Grizzlies win consecutive games for the first time this season. It definitely felt good, Morant said. Coach called the play, they switched and I just attacked. Morant got a chuckle at his fathers reaction, but wasnt surprised. That just shows how much he loves the game and how excited he was, Morant said. I looked and he was already at half court. I was like, Bro, your seat is down on the baseline. But thats just him. Hes always hype. The Hornets battled back from 10 down in the fourth quarter to tie it on a 3-pointer by Devonte Graham from the top of the key with 22.7 seconds left. But after a timeout, Morant got a screen near the top of the key and drove left against Cody Martin and somehow got the layup to fall between three Hornets, including 7-foot center Cody Zeller. I was just trying to contest it, Zeller said. He made a tough shot. Morant wouldnt repeat what he said to the crowd. Id rather not say, he said with a smile. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said the goal was to have Morant make a play coming out of the timeout. Try to put Ja in a position where he could attack one-on-one to score, maybe play make for someone else and then have Brandon Clarke go crash the offensive boards, Jenkins said. Jonas Valanciunas was one of the beneficiaries of Morants passes, finishing with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Marko Guduric had 17 points. Terry Rozier tied a career high with 33 points on seven 3-points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight games. Graham, who entered the game leading the team in points and assists, had 19 points in his first start of the season. The Hornets led by 12 in the third quarter before the Grizzlies went on a 22-5 run led by Morant. TIP INS Grizzlies: Grayson Allen, who starred at Duke a couple of hours away, did not play because of left ankle soreness. Hornets: Were outrebounded 45-35. ... Dwayne Bacon sat out with knee soreness. ... The Hornets have trailed by double digits in every game this season. MORANT VS. CONLEY Morant will face Mike Conley on Friday night, the player the Grizzlies traded away to make room for him. The rookie said the matchup is not personal. Im looking forward to playing the Utah Jazz, Conley said. Its a team game. Im not singling nobody out. Im just going to go out and do whatever I can with my teammates and come out with a win. DONT LET UP Rozier said his goal is to cut down on his turnovers. He and Graham combined for 10 of Charlottes 22 turnovers. We need to really worry about my turnovers and get better on the defensive end and control that, Rozier said. Ill be fine, me and coach communicate just about every day so we are going to get on the same page and were growing together and thats what its about.","401160796"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It took the Orlando Magic 10 3/4 games to find their offense. Nikola Vucevic had 25 points and seven Orlando players scored in double figures as the Magic came up with a big fourth quarter and beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-97 on Wednesday night. ""It was good to see the offense finally click, especially in the fourth quarter when you need it the most,"" said Vucevic, who had 12 of his points in the fourth.

Augustin, who was moved out of the starting lineup six games ago, played the entire fourth quarter, in which the Magic outscored the 76ers 32-15. Josh Richardson led the 76ers with 19 points. Ben Simmons added 18 points, eight rebounds and five assists. The 76ers played without center Joel Embiid, who has a sore left knee. ""It's easy to point to missed shots, but I feel like defensively we have to do more without Joel,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""It takes far more of a collective everything. Sometimes you can make mistakes and you have 7-foot Joel Embiid putting out fires and covering things up. We didn't have that tonight."" Orlando made 11 of its first 16 shots, and led by eight points midway through the first quarter before losing their scoring touch. A 3-pointer by Gordon at the halftime buzzer made it 53-all. Two dunks by Simmons lifted the 76ers to an eight-point lead early in the second half while the Magic went more than 5  1/2 minutes without a field goal. After a jump shot by Richardson put the 76ers up 84-80 early in the fourth quarter, Terrence Ross and Evan Fournier hit back-to-back 3-pointers and the Magic took control with an 18-3 run. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid, who dunked in the final seconds of the 76ers' 98-97 win on Tuesday night, missed his fourth game of the season, including two due to a suspension. ""Injury maintenance"" was also listed as a reason. ... Simmons, who leads the NBA in steals, did not record a steal. ... Harris is 0 for 18 from behind the arc in the last five games. Magic: Markelle Fultz, who replaced Augustin in the starting lineup, has yet to play 25 minutes as a starter and has averaged only 24.2 minutes in his five starts. ""He gets fatigued. (His minutes will increase) little by little,"" explained coach Steve Clifford. ... The Magic held the 76ers to one free throw attempt in the first half after playing a game against Indiana in which neither team shot a free throw in the first half. ...After failing to score 100 points in any of their first seven games, the Magic have gone over 100 in four straight. WHO NEEDS A JUMP SHOT? Brown on Simmons, whose nine field goals included six layups and three dunks: ""His jump shot, his 3-point shot, it gets so beaten up. But to me, the way he can impact the game the most, the quickest and the easiest is defensively. He's a 6-foot-10 thoroughbred. I think the league should take notice of him as a legitimate all-league defensive player.""","401160797"
"BOSTON --  Jayson Tatum was so disappointed in his last game that he went to the teams practice facility later that night to work on his shooting. The Boston Celtics forward could go straight home on Wednesday. Tatum followed up his historically bad shooting performance by scoring 23 points, and Kemba Walker had 25 to help the Celtics overcome 44 points from Bradley Beal and beat Washington 140-133 for Bostons ninth straight victory. Tatum was 1 for 18 in the victory over Dallas on Monday and then posted on Instagram a video of himself back at the teams practice facility,  saying, 1-18 gotta be able to laugh at ya self sometime. On Wednesday, he was 9 for 20, going 1 for 5 from 3-point range. Before the game, Im like, Every nights not gonna be the best night. Its all about the bounce back. And he bounced back tonight, Walker said. I love the way he works on off days to improve his game. We need that kid. We need him a lot, man. Jaylen Brown scored 22 and Enes Kanter had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who have not lost since the season-opener at Philadelphia; its their longest streak since winning 16 in a row in the 2017-18 season. Boston had its highest point total since 1992, but it also allowed 18 more points than in any other game this season. It was ugly, and we got it done, Brown said. But weve got to play Celtic basketball. Rui Hachimura scored 21 points and Davis Bertans had nine points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards, who lost their third straight game, and for the sixth time in seven games. Former Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas, who led Boston to the 2017 Eastern Conference finals, scored 18 and had seven assists. Boston led by two at the half and made it a six-point game after three quarters. After Bertans hit a 3 to open the fourth and make it 102-99, the Celtics ran off the next 10 points. Boston led by 16 points, 137-121, with 3:39 left in the game before the Wizards ran off 12 in a row. Walker hit a 3-pointer with just over a minute left to preserve the victory, and Hachimura missed a 3 at the other end. When you score 133 points, that should win games, Beal said. Especially on the road. Celtics forward Gordon Hayward watched from the bench, two days after he had surgery on his broken left hand. He is expected to miss six weeks. Carsen Edwards, a second-round draft choice, had a career-high 18 points for Boston. OLD FRIENDS Thomas received a standing ovation when he was introduced before the game. When he went to the free throw line in the fourth quarter, a few fans even broke out in an M-V-P! chant. It felt good to be out there, but you know I just want to win, he said. So, we didnt get the job done and that was the most important thing. Overall, it felt good to be back here and to be able to play some meaningful minutes. NO DEFENSE Celtics coach Brad Stevens noted that he was without Hayward, Daniel Theis and Robert Williams III, whom he called three very good defenders. Weve been a good defensive team all year. I would think this would be more of an anomaly than not, he said. One of the things you can do is build up a team when you have guys out. Everybody will have opportunities throughout this stretch. TIP-INS Wizards: Thomas was back for the third time since he was traded to Cleveland as part of the 2017 deal that brought Kyrie Irving to Boston. He was inactive the first time, with Cleveland, and scored zero points in seven minutes when he returned with the Nuggets on March 18, 2018. Celtics: According to Elias Sports Bureau, Tatums performance against Dallas on Monday night was the second-worst shooting performance by a Celtics player in the last 65 seasons, and matched the second-worst shooting percentage by a player on a winning team in 65 years (minimum 15 shots). He was 9 for 20 from the field and 1 for 5 from 3-point range against Washington.","401160798"
"Russell Westbrook pokes fun at Patrick Beverley, saying his reputation as a defensive stopper is overrated after James Harden scored 47 points in the Rockets' win. (0:30) HOUSTON --  James Harden was pestered and harassed on defense by Patrick Beverley for most of Houstons game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night. Despite all of Beverleys antics Harden still scored 47 points and the Rockets outlasted the Clippers 102-93 in a wild game that saw Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers ejected in the fourth quarter. Afterward, Russell Westbrook was asked about Beverleys defensive effort against Harden. Pat Bev trick y'all like he play defense, Westbrook said. He don't guard nobody, man. It's just running around doing nothing. As you seen what happened -- 47. All that commotion to get 47. Houston was up two with about two minutes left when Beverley, a former Rocket, fouled out. Harden made both free throws before grabbing a rebound on the other end and hitting a 3 to make it 95-88. Beverley was given a technical foul during a timeout after the play and Harden hit the two free throws. Rivers was then given two technical fouls and ejected to the delight of son Austin Rivers, the Houston guard who laughed and signaled for the officials to T-up his father. Doc Rivers spent several more seconds screaming at the referees before slowly walking across the court and to the locker room. Doc Rivers said after the game that he was upset with the officials because of a mix up with the number of timeouts. He said that he tried to challenge a play but that it was past the 30 seconds allotted after a play in which to make a challenge. So they told him he didnt burn a timeout on the challenge and he had two remaining. His ejection came after they said he was out of timeouts when he called the timeout where Beverley received his technical. We didn't deserve to win with the way we were playing right now offensively or defensively but mistakes like that cannot happen on this level, Doc Rivers said. That was awful and the response was to throw me out? I didn't swear. I just said: This is nuts. Crew chief Tony Brothers said the Clippers were incorrectly told that they would keep their timeout after it was determined they couldnt challenge a play. He was given an opportunity to try to get his composure, but it didnt happen, Brothers said. He came out onto the floor when we wanted to start resuming play. He was given a technical foul. The first one he says: I dont care, and he continued to stay on the floor so he was given a second technical and ejected. Austin Rivers will still laughing about the situation after the game and tweeted: Welp.... thanksgiving is going to be weird, before talking to reporters. He actually is sensitive with stuff like that so we'll see what happens, Austin Rivers said. I love him, but it was a really good moment that I enjoyed a lot ... I really enjoyed that. It was fun. Harden made both free throws before JaMychal Green made a 3 for Los Angeles. But Harden stole the ball from Kawhi Leonard, and Tyson Chandler made a reverse dunk with 37 seconds left to make it 100-91. Leonard led the Clippers with 26 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists and Lou Williams added 20 points off the bench. Westbrook added 17 points to help the Rockets win their fifth straight game. TIP-INS Clippers: F Paul George (shoulder surgery) is getting close to returning and could make his season debut in the next few days. ... Beverley had six points and two rebounds. ... Green had 20 points. Rockets: G Eric Gordon had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and is expected to miss about six weeks. Gordon was injured on Monday night against New Orleans and general manager Daryl Morey announced that he had surgery on Wednesday. ... Houston made 14 of 42 3-pointers. CAPELAS NIGHT Clint Capela had 12 points and 20 rebounds before going to the locker room with about 4 1/2 minutes remaining after taking a blow to the face while fighting for a rebound. Capela has had at least 20 rebounds in three straight games to become the first Rocket to do that since Moses Malone in 1982. Coach Mike DAntoni said after the game that he thought Capela was OK but that he was being evaluated and theyd know more on Thursday. THEY SAID IT Harden on Houstons defense: These last five or six games we've been holding teams under 100 points or right at 100 points and that's going to get us where we need to go.","401160799"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Andrew Wiggins is making an impact all over the floor, from the arc to the rim, and the Minnesota Timberwolves are playing with a carefree connectedness that has helped elevate their overall performance. These developments are not mutually exclusive. Wiggins kept up his early season surge with 30 points on 12-for-23 shooting, and the Timberwolves handed the San Antonio Spurs their third straight loss, 129-114 on Wednesday night. ""Hey, if you haven't watched us much, these guys are fun to be around,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, giving Minnesota's maximum-contract duo a third consecutive game with 25-plus points apiece. Towns and Wiggins are currently the only teammates in the NBA averaging more than 25 points per game. Wiggins, who added eight rebounds and seven rebounds, drained a pull-up 3-pointer from the left wing in the waning seconds of the third quarter to give the Wolves their biggest lead of the night at 106-95 before they breezed through the final 12 minutes. Wiggins, who has shown a sharp improvement in shot selection under Saunders, received a standing ovation when he was removed late in the game. ""I feel like everybody is happy for each other,"" Wiggins said. ""When someone does good, there's genuine love."" DeMar DeRozan had 27 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 23 points for San Antonio, with the two stars combining to shoot 22 for 34 from the floor, but the Spurs finished just 3 for 17 from 3-point range. The Wolves were 11 for 34, a behind-the-arc advantage they rarely enjoyed in recent seasons. Though they went just 6 for 45 on Sunday in an overtime defeat against Denver and this game ranked third-worst in the league at 30.8%, the increased volume can only help. The Wolves went 15 for 34 from 3-point range at Detroit in their previous game, a season best. ""I think opponents see our organization a little differently. They've been so used to us taking mid-ranges and layups and whatever the case may be, that we never adjusted to what the game has changed to,"" Towns said. ""Not only have we now changed to what the modern NBA is, we are excelling at it tremendously well and being pioneers of excellence with it."" Towns and Wiggins have 35 games with 25-plus points apiece, the fourth-most in the NBA since Towns was a rookie in 2015-16. Wiggins hit the 30-point mark for the fourth time in five games. ""They executed, they were unselfish, and they made 3s,"" said a dismayed Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who took no questions from reporters. ""They had a lot of guys that played well, and they were aggressive. From our end, I think we were very challenged defensively, another poor outing."" The Spurs, with Tony Parker's jersey now hanging from their arena rafters next to Tim Duncan's and Manu Ginobili's, are well past the glory days of their five NBA championships. Popovich lamented their ""really soft"" defense after a 135-115 defeat against Boston last week, and they entered this game ranked just 21st in the league in average points against. They weren't exactly overflowing with intensity on the defensive end in this one, either, squandering a strong start to the second half while watching the Wolves pull away for the third consecutive quarter. Bryn Forbes missed a 3-pointer that would have broken an 83-all tie, and Jake Layman, who was continually slashing to the basket all game, dropped in a finger roll for a lead the Wolves never relinquished. DeRozan picked up a technical foul after arguing a personal foul against him, and the free throws helped the Wolves on their way. ""Nobody wants to lose, but I'd rather that we have these mistakes now. We have plenty of time to clean it up. I know for a fact that we definitely will,"" DeRozan said. TIP-INS Spurs: For the third time in 11 games this season, the Spurs allowed 120-plus points. ... DeRozan and Aldridge each hit the 20-point mark for the second game this season. They did that 24 times during the 2018-19 regular season. Timberwolves: Jeff Teague, who missed the last four games because of illness, returned to action at point guard in a reserve role, with rookie Jarrett Culver in the starting lineup for a fourth time in five games. Teague had 18 points and six assists in 23 minutes. ... The Wolves had consecutive 40-point quarters for the first time in franchise history, in the second and third. DOUBLE TECHNICALS Towns and San Antonio's Rudy Gay were given double technical fouls for a testy exchange, sparked when Gay fouled Towns while he was shooting. A few minutes later, Towns and Wiggins swished 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to break a tie and give the Timberwolves a 57-51 lead. ""I'm not a fan of getting hit with elbows, and I let him know that,"" Gay said. ""That's all.""","401160800"
"LOS ANGELES --  No Anthony Davis for the first time this season, no problem for the Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron James had 23 points and 12 assists in three quarters, Kyle Kuzma and JaVale McGee dominated the middle, and the Lakers rolled past the hobbled Golden State Warriors 120-94 on Wednesday night. Kuzma scored 22 points starting for Davis and McGee had 18 points and 17 rebounds. ""Our bigs were amazing,"" James said. ""They controlled the interior both offensively and defensively."" The Lakers improved to 9-2 despite playing without Davis, who was held out because of a sore right shoulder. ""If one of our stars go down, we have to pick up for him,"" McGee said. The Lakers had 31 assists in the second half of a back-to-back. Their 39 at Phoenix a night earlier was the franchise's most since April 14, 2009. They notched 31 against defending NBA champion Toronto. ""We know we're very good when we're moving the ball,"" said James, adding that assists totaling in the high 20s to 30s ""let's me know we're definitely paying attention."" James &amp; Co. didn't waste any time breaking out. He won the opening tip and McGee scored off his alley-oop pass. James keyed a 12-0 run with six points in the first quarter when the Lakers shot 70 percent and made five 3-pointers. Their 38 points tied a season high for points in a quarter. Los Angeles extended its lead to 18 points in the second. The Warriors scored 11 in a row to get within seven, but the Lakers quickly restored their lead to double digits at halftime. James' vicious one-handed dunk riled up the crowd. Their 67 points tied a season high for points in a half. Former Laker D'Angelo Russell scored 21 points for the Warriors, who lost their fifth in a row and fell to 2-10, worst in the West. ""We're playing hard, but we have defensive lapses and it adds up,"" Russell said. ""We have to figure it out. We have guys that are capable, but we have to continue to learn."" Golden State is but a shadow of the franchise that made five straight NBA Finals appearances. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are injured, and Kevin Durant departed in the offseason. ""We're getting a great effort but we're not executing,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""Right now, we're taking our licks and we must learn from our mistakes. Our young guys are learning by getting thrown into the fire."" Twice the Lakers led by 23 in the third, the second time on a 3-pointer by Dwight Howard. He finished with 15 points and eight rebounds. Los Angeles extended its lead to 27 in the fourth. McGee's one-handed reverse dunk highlighted a 14-5 opening run. ""We did a good job locking in on defense and put a lot of pressure on the paint,"" Kuzma said. James sat out the final period, but he still assisted, pulling Davis and DeMarcus Cousins out of their seats to join the team during a timeout. TIP-INS Warriors: Their five-game winning streak against the Lakers in LA ended. Golden State had won 10 of 11 overall in the series. ... Draymond Green had 10 points in his second game after missing five straight with a left index finger sprain. Lakers: Davis is expected to return Friday. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Toronto Raptors defense gave the team another reason to celebrate. The Raptors held Damian Lillard to just nine points in a 114-106 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Pascal Siakam scored 36 points and Fred VanVleet had 30, but the story for Toronto was a defense that made life difficult for yet another star player on their road trip. After holding LeBron James to 13 points and Kawhi Leonard to just 12 points in their last two games, taking Lillard out of the equation was another notch on the belt for the defending champions. ""It's the defense,"" VanVleet said. ""Offense comes and goes but defense has been pretty consistent for us. The good thing about our game is that most superstars are pretty unselfish so if you throw 2 or 3 guys at them they're passing. We want to make them pass and make somebody else make shots."" ""They're really trying to guard from the start of the game to the end,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of his team. ""I always talk about, can we execute our schemes, where we're supposed go, and they're doing pretty good job of that."" Siakam scored 13 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter to help close out the Trail Blazers and help Toronto bounce back from Monday night's loss to the L.A. Clippers. ""It felt like college a little bit just posting up every possession. It was fun,"" Siakam said. ""That hasn't happened in a while."" Rodney Hood led the Blazers with 25 points. Lillard, who entered Wednesday trailing only James Harden in points per game, had his worst outing of the season. Lillard had 2-fof-12 shooting from the field and was 2 of 7 from 3-point range. He did dish 10 assists. ""It's the fourth team in a row to come out denying me full court. Box-and-one, I don't remember seeing that many box-and-ones in the NBA, but I mean, they make me play against a crowd. Even when I try to get downhill and be aggressive, there's four guys right there. The right play is to kick it ahead, get it out, that was the only option they gave me a lot of times. It's just what it was."" Hood stood up to the Raptors' challenge, returning from a two-game absence with back spasms. CJ McCollum also pitched in 18 points while Anfernee Simons had 17 off the bench. Still, the Trail Blazers once again found themselves staring at a familiar postgame script. ""I get frustrated sometimes losing games, especially losing games that we were in,"" Lillard said. ""If we was getting blown out, I would be getting upset about that but it wouldn't be the same feeling. We in every game, down the stretch when it's time to win a game we're not doing the necessary things to get a win."" The Raptors attacked in waves, with Siakam scoring seven straight points to close the quarter and give the Raptors an 87-78 lead heading into the fourth. The Raptors also got solid bench contributions from Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (16 points, 11 rebounds) and Terence Davis (15 points). The Blazers went on an 11-2 run to start the fourth quarter, tying the game at 89 with 9:06 left as Lillard watched from the bench. Nassir Little made his first NBA start against the defending champs. Little drew the job of guarding Siakam. ""I thought he had a really good game,"" Stotts said of the rookie Little. ""I thought he held his own with Siakam defensively, brought a lot of energy and played hard."" Little finished with seven points and five rebounds. A dunk by Hollis-Jefferson with 5:29 left gave the Raptors a 101-94 lead. Another jumper by Siakam with 3:38 left gave the Raptors a 108-94 lead, their largest of the game. TIP-INS Raptors: The Raptors made a line-up change on Wednesday night as they were without starting small forward OG Anunoby, who is dealing with an injury to his eye. Anunoby, who walked into the Moda Center Wednesday with an eye-patch over his right eye, will likely be available to play when the Raptors finish their road trip later this weekend. ""They told me it was close for this game, that he might make it, but it's not going to happen,"" head coach Nick Nurse said. ""He will be ready to go Saturday in Dallas."" Nurse gave the starting opportunity to reserve forward Malcolm Miller, who had only appeared in two games heading into Wednesday. Trail Blazers: After entering the season with high expectations, the Blazers have sputtered out of the gate through the first 11 games of the season. Tuesday night's loss to a short-handed Sacramento Kings group was as painful as any of the losses they've had to start the season. ""We're not where we want to be,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""The losses at Golden State and (Sacramento) really took a toll. Those two teams were undermanned and if those two games are wins that changes the outlook of where we are. We've played a lot of close games, we've played a lot of good teams competitively but I'd say right now we're a middle of the road team trying to find ourselves."" Now, the Blazers will look to find themselves as they embark on a 10-day, six-game road trip.","401160802"
"CLEVELAND --  The Miami Heat didn't let a night of dominant play slip away in the fourth quarter. Rookie Kendrick Nunn scored 23 points, Bam Adebayo had 16 points and 15 rebounds and Miami, which led the entire game, held off a late Cleveland run and defeated the Cavaliers 108-97 on Thursday night. Miami, which has the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 8-3, was up by 27 points in the third quarter before Cleveland cut the lead to 98-88 with seven minutes to play. The Heat regained control and maintained a double-digit lead down the stretch. ""We found a way to win,"" said Heat forward Jimmy Butler, who had a blocked shot, a basket and a steal in the final three minutes. ""It doesn't matter how you do it, win by one, win by 20. It goes in the same column."" Miami lead 96-74 early in the fourth before Cleveland rallied. Kevin Love hit 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to spark the Cavaliers' run. Butler's basket in the lane, a 3-pointer by Duncan Robinson and four points by Adebayo kept Miami in control. ""It was turnovers, run-outs and not getting stops,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Then we gathered ourselves. Usually games do not go all according to plan and they didn't tonight, particularly in the fourth quarter."" Rookie Tyler Herro, who missed Tuesday's game with an ankle injury, had 16 points, while Butler finished with 14. Love had 21 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, while Collin Sexton added 15 points. Cleveland was coming off a 2-1 road trip and nearly beat Philadelphia on Tuesday before losing 98-97. Cavaliers coach John Beilein thinks the Heat are a good example for his rebuilding team to follow. ""They're doing everything,"" he said. ""They're playing defense as good as it is the league. Their offense is good. They're a high-functioning team. That's how we want to be day in, day out."" The Cavaliers' chances of staying with another of the league's top teams were hit with an early run. Miami made consecutive 3-pointers to take a 9-0 lead, forcing Beilein to use a timeout less than two minutes into the game. The Heat continued to roll and had a 32-15 advantage late in the period. Miami was 15 of 25 from the field and didn't go to the foul line in the quarter. Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. injured his left hand on a breakaway dunk in the fourth quarter. He went to the locker room and didn't return, watching the final minutes from the bench. Nance has played with his left thumb wrapped for several games. ""I'll be all right,"" he said. ""I'm going to get some treatment so we'll know more later. I'm not necessarily certain (what happened). I just felt the pain."" The Heat shot 43 of 79 from the field and made 12 of 30 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Heat: F James Johnson was available after being out Tuesday because of illness, but didn't play. ... Robinson played for Beilein at the University of Michigan. ... Justise Winslow (concussion), Derrick Jones Jr. (hip), KZ Okpala (Achilles) were out for Miami. Cavaliers: Cleveland was 13 of 15 from the foul line in the first half, and still trailed by 22 points. ... F Tristan Thompson, who had eight doubles-doubles in the first 10 games, was held to two points and three rebounds in 23 minutes. BIG NUMBERS Miami had 31 assists, after having 34 on Tuesday. ""They should come every single game just because we share the ball so well,"" Butler said. ""We've got guys who can get the ball to the basket so that always helps."" Beilein, pointing out the Cavaliers are 27th in the league in assists, believes that is another example for his players. ""That tells stories about everything, that the ball's not moving the way it can move,"" he said. ""Most winning teams have high assist numbers. They know that, just making that extra pass is going to be key for them to see that.""","401160803"
"Kristaps Porzingis comments on his return to Madison Square Garden and the reaction from Knicks fans. (1:12) NEW YORK --  Kristaps Porzingis couldnt even hide from the taunts during the national anthem. Hes an enemy now to Knicks fans, and they treated him as rudely as any foe that has played at Madison Square Garden in recent years. I get it around this league, Knicks forward Marcus Morris said, but it was a different level. Morris made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 13 seconds remaining and New York beat the Dallas Mavericks 106-103 on Thursday night. Porzingis was the No. 4 pick in the 2015 draft who developed first into a fan favorite and then an All-Star. But he soured on the Knicks, and the fans have clearly soured on him. They jeered him when the Mavs hit the floor for pregame warmups, continued during the national anthem, when Porzingis won the opening tip and whenever else he touched the ball in the early going. ""I wouldn't say it affected me, Porzingis said. I heard it of course. It was pretty loud. But I tried to play my game, stay focused and not think too much about what's going on on the outside."" Morris also knocked away the Mavericks inbounds pass with under a second left, sending the Knicks to just their third victory in 12 games this season. Porzingis finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds in his first game in New York as a visitor. Luka Doncic had 33 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in his fifth triple-double of the season. Morris scored 20 points and Julius Randle had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who were playing their first home game since they were routed Sunday by Cleveland. Afterward, team President Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry held a press conference to express their disappointment with the teams start. They were much better in this one, fueled by a crowd like few others during the down years while Porzingis was a Knick. Porzingis was playing at MSG for the first time since tearing his ACL on Feb. 6, 2018. While rehabbing the injury, he was surprisingly dealt to Dallas on Jan. 31 after Knicks management said he told them in a meeting that day that he didnt want to stay with the franchise. Porzingis has declined to talk about what caused the deterioration of his relationship with the team, so he understood why there would be such a harsh reception. ""It's what they know. It's what they've heard, he said. It is what it is. We came here to win a game and we're frustrated we didn't get it done."" Porzingis looked rattled at the beginning and then confused in the middle, appearing to walk toward the wrong tunnel at halftime before stopping and turning to exit the opposite direction. He couldnt silence the early boos with a basket, missing his first four shots before finally getting his first field goal on a tip-in about four minutes into the second quarter. ""I've been coming here a long time. Nothing surprises me in here. It was what it was, Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. We knew it was going to be a difficult atmosphere regardless of what the exact response was."" Doncic missed his first six 3-pointers, then made three in a row late in the third quarter. When he finally missed another, Porzingis soared in to slam home the miss with 0.4 seconds left and tie it at 87-all headed to the fourth. TIP-INS Mavericks: After going 1 for 11 on Monday in a loss at Boston, Porzingis finished 7 for 17. ... Tim Hardaway Jr., who was part of the trade with Porzingis, scored 12 points off the bench. Knicks: Mitchell Robinson had 16 points and eight rebounds after being cleared to return from a concussion following a three-game absence. ... The Knicks ended a five-game winning streak by visiting teams in the series, including their victory last Friday in Dallas. SMITH STARS Dennis Smith Jr., the former Mav who came to New York in the Porzingis trade, had 13 points, eight assists and six rebounds. He was shooting just 1 for 14 for the season coming into the game, having recently returned after missing seven games following a death in the family. Just grateful, Smith said. Glad to be playing. Glad to be out there with these guys. Glad to have people that believe in me, so just a lot of gratitude.","401160804"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo ensured the Milwaukee Bucks dominance over the Chicago Bulls didnt end Thursday night. Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 15 rebounds, Eric Bledsoe added a season-high 31 points and eight assists, and the Bucks withstood another historic effort by Chicago rookie Coby White to beat the Bulls 124-115. The Bucks have won seven straight against Chicago dating to 2017. White shot 5 of 8 from 3-point range in the first half, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to hit five 3-pointers in consecutive games. The 19-year-old first-round pick hit seven 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of a 120-102 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night -- the most in a quarter ever by a rookie. White finished Thursday with 26 points, including six 3s. He was terrific, Bulls coach Jim Boylen said of White. I thought a lot of our players played well. Thats a tough team. Antetokounmpo had at least 30 points for the seventh game this season for the Bucks, who played without Khris Middleton. The All-Star forward is expected to miss the next three to four weeks with a thigh bruise. Donte DiVincenzo, who made his first career start in place of Middleton, had four points and five rebounds. I think the team realized in order to win tonight, we got to drive the ball into the paint and get some paint points, Antetokounmpo said. The Bucks made just six 3s while Chicago hit 18 from long range. But Milwaukee outscored the Bulls 70-32 inside. That marked a season high in the paint for Milwaukee. Bledsoe was a perfect 12 for 12 inside the arc. I was just getting some easy looks, man, said Bledsoe, who has scored at least 20 points in each of his last five games. My teammates do a great job of spacing the court. The way they shot the ball leaves gaps for me to drive and its up to me to make those shots. The Bucks missed Middleton early, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Milwaukee struggled to create and make shots, shooting an anemic 4 of 18 from 3 in the first half and trailed 66-65 at halftime. Things switched in the second half when Antetokounmpo threw down a dunk that tied it at 82-82 with 6:37 to play in the third, prompting Boylen to call a timeout. The play ignited the crowd and jumpstarted the Bucks. Wesley Matthews scored 10 of his 15 points from the foul line for Milwaukee. Matthews had just three free-throw attempts coming into the night but had 13 Thursday. This offense is kind of predicated on spacing and ball movement, so everybody can be in any spot, Matthews said. We already can be kind of interchangeable. Were definitely going to miss (Middletons) production on the offensive end. This team is built with a lot of depth and tonight we put up 124. The offense wasnt the problem. We have to stop people. Weve got to find ways to do that. Zach LaVine had 25 points and seven assists before fouling out for Chicago. Wendell Carter Jr. added 14 points and six rebounds. He also fouled out. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had six players score in double figures (White, LaVine, Carter Jr., Lauri Markkanen, 11; Thaddeus Young, 11; and Tomas Satoransky, 10). Bucks: Center Robin Lopez finished with six points and three rebounds. Lopez spent the previous three seasons with the Bulls, averaging 10.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.1 blocks in 219 games. RoLo is a hyper-competitive dude, Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. He likes to win. He likes to win a practice game. He likes to win a 1-on-1 game, a shooting game. I like that competitive spirit that he has.","401160805"
"After his Clippers debut, Paul George says he needs more time to get a feel for real-time game-speed activities despite dropping 33 points in just 24 minutes of action. (0:44) NEW ORLEANS --  Paul George expected to shoot well in his Clippers debut because his surgically repaired shoulders felt great. It was the rest of his game -- from ball handling to defense  that concerned him. Jrue Holiday scored 36 points and stole the ball from George three times in the final minutes to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 132-127 victory over Los Angeles on Thursday night. I thought I was terrible, said George, who was limited to 24 minutes by early foul trouble but still scored 33 points. Thats the best my shoulders have felt in a really long time, so I knew coming into tonight shooting wouldnt be a problem, George added. Just playing basketball is what Im lacking right now. George was playing for the first time since signing as a free agent with the Clippers because hed been recovering from procedures in May on his right shoulder and June on his left. A lot of breakdowns happened because of my lack of being out there with those guys, George said. Im here to win games and I didnt get a win. ... We had a chance to win tonight and a couple bad possessions in a row that we have down the stretch and we lose. Thats what I gauge good games and bad games on. Holiday, who had six steals in all, intercepted of Lou Williams attempted bounce pass in the final seconds to seal the victory. The play capped off a night in which Holiday scored 12 in the final 4:20, including a pair of pivotal 3s. It felt good, said Holiday, who hadnt scored as many as 20 points in any of his previous eight games. Its all about timing and rhythm. I felt like I got a little bit of that back tonight. Derrick Favors, in his first season with New Orleans, had 20 points and a career-best 20 rebounds in the first 20-20 game of his 10-year career. Im starting to get comfortable now and just try to keep it going throughout the year, Favors said. It was a great game for me, a great game for the team, and we came out and played hard, but we just have to stay consistent. Frank Jackson added 23 points in a reserve role. The Clippers played without Kawhi Leonard, who was being rested for the third time this season to ease stress on his sore knee after playing a night earlier in a loss at Houston. But the Pelicans were hardly sympathetic with starters Brandon Ingram (right knee) and Lonzo Ball (groin) sidelined, as well. Georges 3 cut the Pelicans lead to 126-123 with 42 seconds left. But the Clippers left Jackson unguarded on the perimeter on the other end, and he took his time squaring up and connecting on his fourth 3 of the game to restore New Orleans six-point lead with 30 seconds left. J.J. Reddick, who started and scored 19, hit two free throws with 11.4 seconds left to help wrap up just New Orleans third victory in 11 games this season. Williams scored 31 points and Rodney McGruder 20 for the Clippers, whove dropped two straight. TIP-INS Clippers: Montrezl Harrell had 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting. ... McGruder came in 1 of 6 on 3s for the season and hit 5 of 7 in New Orleans. ... The Clippers were 11 of 24 from 3, with George hitting 3 of 5. ... Patrick Beverly also sat out with a sore left calf Pelicans: ETwaun Moore scored 15 in his first start of the season as the Pelicans used their eighth starting lineup in their first 11 games. ... Guard Josh Hart (left knee and ankle sprains) and center Jahlil Okafor (left ankle sprain) both joined Ingram, Ball and top draft choice Zion Williamson in street clothes on the bench. MOMENTUM SHIFTS The Pelicans trailed 43-36 early in the second quarter when they put together the games first big run. Favors scored six straight points on a free throw, a tip-in and his first 3-pointer of the season from the left corner. Holidays 3 soon after capped a 13-1 run which put New Orleans up 50-44. Holiday added two more 3s, and Jackson another to widen New Orleans lead to 14 at 66-52. Holidays driving dunk and finger roll pushed his two-quarter point total to 24, and the Pelicans led 72-59 at halftime. George opened the second half with a driving layup, pull-up jumper and a 3 as part of an 11-2 run to make it 74-70. Los Angeles inched ahead when Williams hit a 3 and followed with a driving layup as he was fouled to make it 88-86. Neither team led by more than eight after that.","401160806"
"PHOENIX --  Kelly Oubre Jr. followed his worst game of the season with his best and its a huge reason the Phoenix Suns kept rolling through their early season schedule. Oubre scored a season-high 30 points, Devin Booker added 27 and the Suns beat the Atlanta Hawks 128-112 on Thursday night. Phoenix (7-4) took a 104-90 lead into the final quarter after Oubre nailed a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the third and kept a comfortable lead throughout the fourth. The Suns are off to their best start through 11 games since 2009, when they started 9-2. Oubres big performance came two days after a rare off-night. He scored just one point in 19 minutes in a loss to the Lakers. It feels good, but at the end of the day I try not to get too high or too low, Oubre said. I could have been super low and not done this today. Just trying to stay level is my main thing. Being like water. Dario Saric added 23 points after shooting 9 of 12 from the field, including 3 of 5 from 3-point range. I just think Dario is a guy that I need to incorporate more, Suns coach Monty Williams said. He makes the right plays, he can shoot the ball, hes efficient. Atlanta (4-7) was led by Jabari Parker, who scored 24 points. Trae Young had 21 points and 13 assists two nights after a 42-point, 11-assist performance in a win over Denver. The banged-up Hawks were missing several key players due to injuries. Not a fun game, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Thats all I got. Its all we got. Weve got no bodies. Its just one of those nights the whistle didnt go our way. Parker wasnt thrilled with the officiating, either. The Hawks were called for 31 fouls, including several on the offensive end. I am from Chicago, Illinois, Parker said. I played in the public league and we never called offensive fouls that much, but I mean, that was the pace of the game, thats just how it went down and hopefully we can get them back when we come home. Booker scored 19 points in the first half as the Suns built a 67-61 halftime lead. Young had 17 points and six assists for the Hawks. MISSING PIECES Both the Hawks and the Suns were missing key pieces to their teams because of 25-game suspensions for violating the NBAs Anti-Drug program. Suns center Deandre Ayton played in just one game before being suspended for using a diuretic. Hawks forward John Collins tested positive for a growth hormone called Peptide-2. Ayton was the No. 1 pick one year ago and had 18 points and 11 rebounds in his only game this season. Collins was averaging 17 points and 8.8 rebounds before his suspension. BEMBRY, REDDISH EJECTED Hawks guard DeAndre Bembry was ejected in the third quarter after getting called for two quick technical fouls. He got the first technical for taunting after blocking Ricky Rubios shot. He earned the second a few seconds later for arguing. Booker also was called for a technical during the commotion. Rookie Cam Reddish was ejected with about four minutes left after getting two flagrant fouls on two separate plays on offensive fouls when he hit a Suns defender in the face with his elbow. LENS BIG GAME Atlanta center Alex Len had one of his best games of the season with 21 points and 10 rebounds, including five on the offensive end. Len was booed occasionally throughout the game. He was drafted by the Suns with the fifth overall pick in 2013, but struggled during five rough seasons before signing with the Hawks. TIP-INS Hawks: Kevin Huerter (left shoulder), Evan Turner (left Achilles pain) and Vince Carter (personal reasons) didnt play on Thursday. Coach Lloyd Pierce said the Hawks are relieved that Huerter doesnt need surgery for his injury and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Suns: Rookie guard Ty Jerome still hasnt played this season because of a right ankle sprain he suffered just before the beginning of the regular season. ... Frank Kaminsky scored 19 points on Thursday and Cam Johnson added 15.","401160807"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic had plenty of postgame jokes -- about the bench and especially about Paul Millsap. The Denver big man was simply in a playful mood after another come-from-behind win. Jokic had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Mason Plumlee provided a boost off the bench and the Nuggets wore down the Brooklyn Nets in a 101-93 win Thursday night. For that, Jokic credited the bench's second-half performance. ""Not that much in the first half,"" he quipped before patting Plumlee on the back and adding, ""but they were phenomenal in the second."" His next target? Millsap, who finished with 18 points. ""Paul is playing like he's 21 not 77,"" Jokic said of the forward who's actually 34. Millsap shook his head when the jab about his age got back to him. ""I don't know if that's a compliment or not?"" he said. ""I just feel good."" The Nuggets tired out a Nets team playing their fourth road game in seven nights. Brooklyn shot 23% and went 0 for 17 from 3-point range in the second half. All those misses helped the Nuggets stage another rally. They overcame a 21-point, four-quarter deficit in a win over Philadelphia last week. On Thursday, the Nuggets trailed by 16 points in the third quarter before using a 19-6 run to work their way back. The comeback was spurred in large part by Denver's bench. Plumlee was pivotal when Jokic went to the bench with 6:37 left in the third in foul trouble. Plumlee scored all 10 of his points in the second half. ""Plumlee, that's what he does,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I thought their second unit really gave them a boost."" Denver took its first lead since the first quarter on Jerami Grant's 3-pointer with 9:30 remaining. The Nuggets wouldn't relinquish it. Kyrie Irving had 17 points and nine assists despite a sore right shoulder. Irving was questionable earlier in the day but got treatment and was ready to go by game time. DeAndre Jordan had an interesting stat line -- 11 rebounds and no points. Jarrett Allen added 17 points and 10 boards as the Nets dropped to 1/3 on their five-game trip. ""When teams make their runs we just have to be able to respond right away,"" Irving said. ""Just settle ourselves down and really go into our offensive package and just run the plays that work for us."" The Nets entered with a dynamic offense and Denver with a top-notch defense. In the first half, Brooklyn controlled the tempo with their shooting. In the second, the Nuggets took it back with defense. They've now held opponents to fewer than 100 points in five of the last six games. ""Our defense got us going,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""That ignites our break. We started rebounding and running. That's when we're at our best."" TIP-INS Nets: F Taurean Prince was given a technical foul for a hold in the first quarter. ... G/F Garrett Temple briefly left in the third after being hit in the chin by Gary Harris' elbow. Harris was issued a flagrant foul. ... Former University of Colorado standout Spencer Dinwiddie had 17 points. Nuggets: G Malik Beasley (illness) didn't play. ... Denver had seven players in double figures. ... F Will Barton finished with 17. LEVERT UPDATE Nets guard Caris LeVert underwent surgery Thursday to repair ligaments in his right thumb. There's no timetable for his return. LeVert is averaging 16.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists. He missed half of last season with a dislocated right foot. ""It's bad luck especially with what he went through last year,"" Atkinson said. ""I feel for him."" SHUMPERT'S ROLE Veteran guard Iman Shumpert was signed Wednesday to fill a specific need for the Nets -- perimeter defense. ""That's always been his calling card,"" said Atkinson, who was an assistant coach with New York when Shumpert played for the Knicks. ""I know him well, know the personality. He gets after it defensively."" Shumpert didn't play Thursday. JUANCHO SIGHTING Juancho Hernangomez played 19 minutes. This after seeing the floor a combined 19:24 all season. He had two points but provided plenty of energy. ""Juancho is the hardest worker here,"" Jokic said. IRVING &amp; MURRAY There was some history between Irving and Nuggets guard Jamal Murray. When Irving was at Pepsi Center last November -- as a member of the Boston Celtics -- he took exception to Murray, sitting on 48 points, taking a shot in the closing seconds of a game already decided. Irving threw the ball into the stands.","401160808"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Things havent always gone the way Malik Monk hoped during his first two seasons with the Charlotte Hornets. But coach James Borrego said the third-year shooting guard never stopped working -- and now hes starting to see some big results. Monk knocked down a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Charlotte Hornets a 109-106 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night, helping snap a four-game losing streak. Every game is getting better and better, so hopefully I just keep going up, said Monk, who finished with 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting. Ive been working hard for these two or three years and Ive been waiting for my moment. It came after Pistons point guard Derrick Rose drove the lane and threw the ball away with a second left. Monk, who was the third option on the inbounds play from midcourt, came flying around a screen, caught the pass from Cody Martin and buried the jumper with a smooth stroke. Devonte Graham, who had 18 points and 10 assists in his second start, said Monk asked coach James Borrego in the huddle to run a play for him. That didnt surprise Borrego, who has seen Monks confidence grow as the season has progressed. Hes gone from a player who didnt see any action at all in some games last season to one that is starting to be ultra-aggressive, as evidenced by three coast-to-coast layups in traffic. Hes starting to shine more and more, and that comes with confidence and maturity, Borrego said. Youre starting to see signs of why we drafted him. Give him a lot credit because hes stuck with it and is getting better. Things havent worked in his favor the last couple of years, but hes owned that and hes improved. Langston Galloway had a career-high 32 points on seven 3-pointers for Detroit, and Andre Drummond added 16 points and 20 rebounds. The Pistons have lost four straight. This is the second time this team got us at the buzzer here, so its tough, Galloway said. Its a tough one to swallow. TIP INS Pistons: Bruce Brown and Cody Zeller had to be separated after getting tied up underneath the basket midway through the fourth quarter. They were called for double fouls. Hornets: Graham got his second straight start with Dwayne Bacon (sore right knee) still out. ... Coach James Borrego got a technical when he argued an offensive foul against Miles Bridges when he accidentally elbowed Griffin in the head. GRIFFINS RETURN Blake Griffin had 19 points on 6-of-19 shooting after missing the last three games with left hamstring and posterior knee soreness. ROSES TURNOVER Pistons coach Dwane Casey said the teams final play was designed to have Rose kick the ball out to the corner, but instead the veteran point guard dished to the wing. However, nobody was there and the ball sailed out of bounds. It hurt a lot, but Ill take the blame for tonight, Rose said. Late turnovers and Ill figure it out. Casey said he doesnt fault Rose. He got in the paint and got where he wanted to go, Casey said. He just didnt make the right decision on his kickout. ANOTHER SLOW START In what has become a disturbing trend for the Hornets, they started slow and dug themselves an 11-2 hole after missing six of their first seven shots. Charlotte (5-7) has trailed by double digits in all 12 games this season. I dont know why we keep coming out so flat -- 9-0 starts and getting down 10, 12, 15 and then start to ramp it up, Graham said. We need to be able to come out with that same energy that we play with when were down 15.","401160809"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  When Evan Fournier and Terrence Ross hit shots with the game on the line, the Orlando Magic are a much different team. Fournier scored 26 points, including a couple of late 3-pointers, and the Magic beat San Antonio 111-109 on Friday night to hand the Spurs their fourth straight defeat. Ross had 10 of his season-high 20 points in the fourth quarter to help the Magic win consecutive games for the first time this season. ""That's what T-Ross does, time and time again, when we win games,"" said Aaron Gordon, who had 14 points and eight rebounds. ""He steps up and makes big shots. We needed them tonight badly."" Fournier's 3-pointer with 1:15 remaining put the Magic ahead to stay. He shot 5 of 6 from behind the arc in his highest-scoring game of the season. ""When T-Ross and I both make shots, it just spreads the floor and it gives us more opportunity,"" Fournier said. ""Then the paint is open for Vuc (Nikola Vucevic). It's the lineup we mostly ended games with last year and it's the lineup we are comfortable with."" DeMar DeRozan scored 21 for the Spurs, who shot 50.6 percent from the field but gave up 64 points in the second half and were outrebounded 48-41. ""I think the difference in the game was we gave up too many offensive rebounds (14),"" DeRozan said. ""We couldn't get the rebounds when it counted and they did. They executed on those, and other than that it was a one-possession game."" A flagrant foul call helped the Magic maintain their lead in the final seconds. After Trey Lyles' 3-pointer cut Orlando's advantage to 107-106 with 18 seconds left, Gordon drew a foul on DeRozan with 13.9 seconds remaining that was upgraded to a flagrant after a replay review. Gordon made the free throws and the Magic kept the ball, enabling Vucevic to add another foul shot for a four-point edge. A 3-pointer by Bryn Forbes with 4:17 left in the second quarter put San Antonio up 50-34, the largest lead for either team. The Spurs shot 53 percent in the first half and led 56-47 at halftime. Orlando ran off 12 straight points early in the third quarter and took a 69-66 lead on a 3 by Fournier. Patty Mills and Jakob Poeltl provided points off the bench to pull the Spurs back ahead. They went up 99-92 when LaMarcus Aldridge hit a 3 with 4:42 left. TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray played 21 minutes but will sit out Saturday night against Portland, part of the plan for his recovery from knee surgery a year ago. ... Aldridge missed all six of his shots in the first half. ... The Spurs have given up 122 points per game during their losing streak. Magic: F Jonathan Isaac did not play after rolling his right ankle Thursday night during the unveiling of the Magic's City-Edition uniforms at Disney World. ""We were taking pictures, just shooting around and I got a little careless,"" said Isaac, the first Orlando starter to miss a game this season. He hopes to play Sunday against Washington. ... F Al-Farouq Aminu grabbed 13 rebounds in his first start for the Magic. ... G Michael Carter-Williams was called for three fouls in 13 seconds late in the first quarter. ... Vucevic shot 4 for 16. INJURIES HAPPEN Magic coach Steve Clifford on Isaac's bizarre injury: ""People always say I shouldn't leave guys in at the end of the game when we have a 12-point lead because somebody might get hurt. Hey, somebody could get hurt walking down the hall. It happens all the time.""","401160810"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets got another huge offensive game from James Harden. But it was the team's defense against the Indiana Pacers that the Rockets thought was the most impressive part of their win. Harden scored 44 points and the Rockets used a big fourth quarter run to pull away and get the 111-102 victory on Friday night. Houston has won a season-high six games in a row and Harden has scored 36 points or more in five straight games to carry the Rockets as they deal with injuries to Clint Capela, Eric Gordon and Danuel House. Indiana led by 4 on a 3-pointer by Doug McDermott before Houston used a 14-0 spurt to make it 94-88 with about five minutes left. Harden took over in that stretch, scoring the last 12 points and making two 3-pointers. The Pacers couldn't do anything offensively as Houston built its lead and missed seven shots and had two turnovers. Harden was asked how big the team's defense in that stretch was to the win. ""It was huge,"" Harden said. ""That's the game right there."" Indiana got its first point in almost five minutes when Domantas Sabonis made the second of two free throws with less than five minutes to go and Justin Holiday made a layup about a minute later. But Russell Westbrook hit a 3-pointer seconds after that to push the Rockets' lead to 10 with three minutes remaining. Though the defense has improved during this winning streak, Westbrook still sees room for improvement. ""We're moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We're doing a good job of staying locked in for the most part ... and it's showing."" The Pacers cut it to six points with a 3 by Aaron Holiday with about a minute left, but Tyson Chandler added a tip-in layup to secure the victory. Sabonis had 18 points and 13 rebounds and McDermott added 18 points off the bench as Indiana had its four-game winning streak was snapped. Ben McLemore had a season-high 21 points and Westbrook scored 17 with eight rebounds and six assists. ""He hit some timely 3s,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said of McLemore. ""His defense is always pretty good. He runs the floor. He plays really hard and he can shoot. So yeah -- he was good."" A dunk by Justin Holiday got the Pacers within four points midway through the third quarter before Houston used an 8-2 run to make it 75-65 with about four minutes left in the quarter. McLemore led the way in that stretch with two 3-pointers. The Pacers got going after that, scoring the next 10 points to tie it with about a minute left in the third. Houston missed five shots and had a turnover to allow Indiana to close the gap. Austin Rivers ended a scoring drought of more than three minutes by Houston after that, but Indiana scored the next four points to take a 79-77 lead. Houston entered the fourth quarter up by 1 after P.J. Tucker hit a 3-pointer at the end of the third. The Pacers, who were already without Myles Turner and Jeremy Lamb because of injuries, played most of Friday's game without Malcolm Brogdon after he left in the first quarter with a sore lower back. ""That's a big loss when you're going up against guys like Harden and Westbrook,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""Not only do you need him offensively but you need his size defensively."" TIP-INS Pacers: Turner missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle, but could return on Saturday night. ... Lamb sat out for the fifth game in a row with a sprained left ankle. ... T.J. Warren busted his lip and was bleeding after a collision in the third quarter. He was tended to by a trainer for a few minutes and re-entered the game late in the quarter. Rockets: C Capela missed the game and won't play on Saturday after sustaining a concussion on Wednesday night. ... Rivers scored 10 points off the bench. ... Houston made 14 of 46 3-pointers. LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON Chandler made his first start of the season in place of Capela at center against Sabonis. It wasn't the first time he'd played against a member of the Sabonis family, after playing two games against Sabonis's father, Arvydas Sabonis, in his last NBA season in 2002-03. Chandler, who was in his second NBA season, was 20 that year and Arvydas Sabonis was 38. ""Both of them are great players,"" the 37-year-old Chandler said. ""His dad was huge and so skilled. I think I caught him at the end of his career after injuries and all that. But his son is really good and has a bright future ahead of him.""","401160811"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Memphis celebrated former point guard Mike Conleys returned to town. It was his rookie replacement with the Grizzlies who stole the show. Ja Morant, the No. 2 pick in last summers draft, scored 25 points, including the go-ahead basket with 1:32 remaining, Dillon Brooks added 20 point and Memphis beat the Utah Jazz 107-106 on Friday night, spoiling Conleys homecoming. Morant added eight assists along with several highlight-worthy plays. While the rookie from Murray State is still learning control of his speed and flashiness, it already appears Memphis has found a suitable replacement to Conley for the long term. Hes incredible, Jaren Jackson Jr. said of Morant. His change of speeds, change of direction is just different. Its something you dont find too often. Its kind of a once-in-a-lifetime talent. Morant's inside basket gave Memphis a 107-105 lead. Utahs Rudy Gobert split a pair of free throws with 53 seconds left and both teams missed shots down the stretch. Utah had one last chance when the ball was inbounded to Donovan Mitchell with two seconds left. But as Mitchell turned, Solomon Hill stripped the ball away, giving Memphis its third straight win. I got fouled. Really not much else to it, Mitchell said. They defended it well, but hit my whole arm. This is the third time its happened at the end of the game and havent gotten a foul call, which at this point is ridiculous. Utah coach Quin Snyder said: I havent seen the last play. Its hard to tell, Obviously, its a no-call, so its hard to challenge. The game marked the return of Conley, the long-time Memphis guard who spent his entire career with the Grizzlies until a trade to Utah over the summer. While there was plenty of admiration from his former fan base, Conley struggled, scoring 15 points on 5-for-19 shooting. Mitchell led the Jazz with 29 points and nine rebounds. Gobert had 23 points and 17 rebounds, while Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points. But despite a tight game, particularly down the stretch, it was hard to avoid not recognizing the Grizzlies point guard past facing the franchise point guard of the future. They show that support for me already, Morant said when asked about the crowds love of Conley. Obviously, its different with him. Hes a legend here, but I appreciate Mike. TIP-INS Jazz: G Dante Exum was part of the active roster for the game, but did not play. Exum has not played since Jan. 5, rehabbing a partially torn patellar tendon. ... Gobert had his seventh double-double of the season. He also had a season-best five blocks. ... Mitchell has reached at least 20 points in 10 of Utahs first 12 games. Grizzlies: The three games in the Grizzlies winning streak have come by four, two and one point. ... Jae Crowder had 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... All of Kyle Andersons 13 points came in the first half. ... Rookie F Brandon Clarke had 10 points, making five of his seven shots. He has reached double-figure scoring in nine of his first 11 games. ... Memphis is 5-1 when making at least 10 3-pointers. WELCOME BACK, MIKE As expected, Conley was given a heros welcome upon returning to the city where he started his career and played 12 seasons, leaving as the franchise leader in points, 3-pointers made, assists, steals and games played. The night included a first-quarter tribute video to the player known in Memphis as The Conductor. I didnt know what to do ... I had to watch it. Conley said. It was tough. My teammates were waiting for me to cry. It was a weird situation. Donovan Mitchell, when asked about the video, said: I almost cried for him. That was pretty special. TANDEM ALLEY-OOP In the second quarter, Grizzlies forward Jae Crowder threw a lob toward the basket that appeared headed to Jaren Jackson Jr. But as Jackson went up, Morant came streaking along the baseline from the left and stole the dunk. It wasnt on purpose, Morant said. I was just running and pointing for the lob and Jae threw it. I was just going to dunk the lob and Jaren jumped too. I mean, somebody had to finish that play, and we couldnt let it be a turnover or something.","401160812"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  As coach Scott Brooks rattled off the things he was happy about in Washingtons 137-116 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night -- Moritz Wagners best game in the NBA, improved defense in the second half -- he didnt even mention Bradley Beals second straight 44-point performance until he was prompted. I forgot about Brad, Brooks said. Hes a stud. He brings it every night. The Wizards have grown accustomed to Beal carrying the load on offense, as he did once again on 15-of-22 shooting. It was the third 40-point outburst this season for the All-Star guard, who has topped 30 five times in his last seven games. It was Wagners big game, though, that helped set the tone for Washington. Wagner came off the bench to add 30 points and 15 rebounds -- both career highs. He became the first reserve in NBA history to have 30 points, 15 boards and four 3-pointers in a game. I just tried to do my job, Wagner said. I tried to talk to (my teammates) in a positive way. Im working on that every day, kind of stay within the game and not let distractions distract me. The things Wagner did on the defensive end were the talk of Washingtons postgame locker room. The second-year center drew three charges to help spark the Wizards defense in the first half. Those are energy boosts, Beal said. Those are smart plays, getting Karl-Anthony Towns in foul trouble and trying to make it difficult and frustrating guys. Hes really good at that. Wagner and the Wizards dominated Minnesota down low all night. Washington scored 76 points in the paint, a season high. Towns, celebrating his 24th birthday, led the Timberwolves with 36 points. Minnesotas star big man, who missed the first meeting with Washington this season while serving a two-game suspension, scored 19 in the second quarter. Neither team played much defense in the first half, as Washington led 76-73 at halftime. The Wizards held Minnesota to 43 second-half points. Second half came and we continued to not play the defense we wanted to play and we just couldnt match them bucket for bucket, Towns said. And thats why the game got out of hand. The Timberwolves were without leading scorer Andrew Wiggins, who missed the game due to personal reasons. Wiggins was averaging a team-high 25.9 points through the first 11 games of the season. Wiggins had been especially effective over his last six games, averaging 31.6 points. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with him and we did miss him, Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. As the Timberwolves adjusted their lineup in Wiggins absence, point guard Jeff Teague stepped back into the starting five after coming off the bench Wednesday against San Antonio. He had 13 points and 11 assists. TIP-INS Wizards: Entered with the third-worst scoring defense in the NBA, allowing 120 points per game.  The Wizards scored 27 points off 20 Minnesota turnovers, a season high.  Washingtons 38 assists marked a season high. Timberwolves: Saunders didnt know if Wiggins would be available Saturday against Houston. I dont comment necessarily on personal matters, Saunders said. But one thing I will say is family is family, and we are family. Andrew has the time that he needs to deal with any personal matters.  Minnesota transferred two-way player Kelan Martin to the roster. Martin entered late in the first quarter, his second appearance with the Timberwolves this season.  The Wolves were 11 for 37 from 3-point range.","401160813"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  When Danilo Gallinari hit a big 3-pointer in overtime, the crowd roared in support of the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was just like old times. Gallinari scored 28 points to help Oklahoma City beat the Philadelphia 76ers 127-119 on Friday night. Chris Paul had 27 points for the Thunder, who had dropped three of four. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points, and Terrance Ferguson finished with 19. It was the biggest win of the season for a franchise that lost All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George in offseason trades. The sellout Chesapeake Energy Arena crowd of 18,203 backed the Thunder with loud cheering in the fourth quarter and overtime and made it seem, for a night, like nothing had changed in a venue long known as one of the league's loudest places. ""It was amazing,"" Gallinari said. ""These are the moments players live for and these are the moments you want at home. It was great to get them a W."" Gallinari missed a jumper from the top of the key that would have won it at the end of regulation, but he made up for it with seven points in overtime. The Thunder relentlessly attacked the bigger 76ers and outscored them 35-15 at the free-throw line. Oklahoma City shot 53.9% from the field for the night. ""I give our guys credit because I think we tried to play to our identity and tried to do it consistently through four quarters,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Joel Embiid had 31 points and 12 rebounds and Josh Richardson added 28 points for the 76ers, who have lost five of seven. ""We're obviously frustrated,"" forward Tobias Harris said. ""Losing five of seven is not where we want to be. It's early in the season, and right now, we're going to progress and get better and find ways to figure out ways to help each other and help our team and go from there."" Oklahoma City outscored Philadelphia 20-12 in overtime. The Thunder went 5 for 7 from the field and 8 for 8 at the line in the extra period. ""Lots of whistles,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""They called it how they wanted to call it. ... Sometimes, the game is called that way, and that's how it was."" TIP-INS 76ers: Made their first five shots. ... Shot 59.1% in the first quarter to take a 29-24 lead. ... Harris scored 21 points before he fouled out in overtime. G Ben Simmons also fouled out in overtime. He had 16 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. ... Embiid returned after missing a game with soreness in his left knee. Thunder: G Hamidou Diallo sat out with a left knee strain. ... C Nerlens Noel fouled out. He had six points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes. ... Donovan won a coach's challenge for possession with 4:37 remaining in the game and the 76ers leading 96-93. HE SAID IT Brown, on his players fouling with Oklahoma City already in the bonus: ""I think there has to be better awareness on bonus stuff. I think there has to be better discipline of not taking swipes at things when you've got to show your hands. I thought there were some hard luck fouls that might be questionable. But at the end of the day when you look at this, I think it points to free throws."" BOUNCING BACK Gallinari broke out of a mini-slump by shooting 7 for 11 from the field, including a 3-for-5 performance from 3-point range. He also made all 11 of his free throws. Gallinari went 3 for 8 against Indiana in his previous game and missed all three of his 3-pointers. In the game before that, he shot 4 for 17 and made just 2 of 10 3s. STAT LINES Paul had perhaps his best game with the Thunder. He scored 12 points in the fourth quarter to give Oklahoma City a chance.","401160814"
"Draymond Green discusses the difficulties the Warriors have been dealing with regarding losing players to injury so frequently this season. (0:36) SAN FRANCISCO --  Yet another Golden State starter went down with an injury when DAngelo Russell sprained his right thumb, but the Warriors still made mighty Boston work until the waning moments. Jayson Tatum dunked after a jump ball with 1:36 left to put Boston ahead, and the Celtics held off the undermanned Warriors 105-100 on Friday night for their 10th straight win since losing the season opener. An out-of-bounds call initially in Golden States favor went to replay review and was overturned, leading to the jump ball. Kemba Walker hit a 3-pointer with 2:19 to play that pulled Boston to 97-95, then Daniel Theis made one free throw with 1:41 remaining. The Warriors got the ball back with 54.3 seconds left on another overturned replay, but Alec Burks missed a 3 that would have tied it and Walker scored on the other end. Were trying to get better and that starts with just competing, Golden State center Willie Cauley-Stein said. Were taking little steps. Today we had a chance to win it. Russell had 12 points and seven assists but also nine of his teams 19 turnovers before leaving with that aching thumb in the Warriors sixth straight defeat. X-rays were negative and he will have an MRI. Injury-plagued Golden State -- playing without Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson -- faced the NBAs top two teams in consecutive games, losing to the Lakers on the road Wednesday. We played our best defensive game of the year. Thats what really matters, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Burks scored 20 points off the bench, making 11 of 12 free throws as Golden States cast of youngsters nearly pulled off a November upset by outhustling Boston for much of the night, crashing the boards and creating second chances. Jaylen Brown had 22 points and eight rebounds, and Tatum overcame a slow start to score 24 points for the Celtics, who lost Oct. 23 at Philadelphia to start the season before beginning their longest winning streak since 2017. We knew that we were going to get their best shot, Brown said. They came out high intensity, they jumped on us early. As were a young team, were getting used to being the team thats being (chased) and handling that better. The Warriors hung tough until late, keeping the crowd engaged -- something that hasnt always been the case so far given the early struggles for a franchise thats reached five straight NBA Finals. Warriors fans have always appreciated high energy, hustle, toughness, great competition, Kerr said. You could feel it in the building tonight. Our fans really enjoyed watching our guys compete, and thats important. We want people to come into this building and be excited about watching our team. Its been a rough start, but if we can compete that way and play that way were going to win some games and our fans will enjoy what were doing. Boston had four starters reach double figures in scoring after seven players did so in a 140-133 win against Washington on Wednesday. Each team was missing a star player following surgery for a broken left hand: Golden State two-time MVP Curry and Boston forward Gordon Hayward, who missed his third straight game and second since the procedure. TIP-INS Celtics: Brown and Tatum had three steals apiece, while Theis and Marcus Smart had two each. ... Boston shot 7 for 23 in the first quarter and 10 of 22 in the second to lead 52-51 at the break. ... The Celtics won their second straight on Golden States home floor and just their eighth in the last 24. ... It had been nearly 50 years since Boston played in San Francisco, a 116-111 Warriors win on Feb. 21, 1970, at Civic Auditorium. ... Boston is 3-0 vs. the Western Conference and 2-0 on the road. Warriors: Russell had his streak of five straight 20-point games snapped. ... Curry, his hand in a brace, cheered when Golden State won a challenge midway through the third and a foul call on Eric Paschall was overturned. ... C Kevon Looney, who missed the entire preseason and only played briefly in the season opener, will be re-evaluated next Wednesday for a nerve issue that has contributed to his right hamstring injury. C Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) is yet to play and also will be examined again Wednesday, the team said. GOLDEN STATES ROUGH START At 2-11, the Warriors are off to their worst start since beginning 2-16 in 1999-00. The six-game losing streak matches their longest since dropping six in a row from Feb. 5-19, 2013. Golden State dropped to 1-6 at home in new Chase Center. The Warriors are 64-13 at home vs. the Eastern Conference since 2014-15, but 0-2 this season. QUOTEABLE Nobody is preordained to get to play in the finals every year. It just doesnt work that way. We sort of look at it the opposite way in that how lucky weve been to be part of this group over the last for me five years, for Draymond (Green) the last seven years, and have a lot of success. Maybe we were due for a year like this. Thats kind of how life works, so lets make the most of it. -- Kerr on Green being the Warriors last healthy superstar.","401160815"
"LOS ANGELES --  After just 12 games together, Anthony Davis and LeBron James already know how to share the workload in their formidable partnership. Davis struggled to find his offensive game against Sacramento, so James did most of the heavy lifting with 29 points and 11 assists. But when the Lakers needed a big defensive play at the buzzer, Davis got both hands around it. James hit two free throws with 5.5 seconds to play, and Davis blocked Harrison Barnes' driving shot at the buzzer with two hands to end Los Angeles' 99-97 victory over former coach Luke Walton and the Kings on Friday night. Davis had only 17 points in his second lowest-scoring performance for the Lakers, but he came through late to seal their 10th win in 11 games. Davis had little rhythm with the ball in his hands, so James consciously took the lead on offense while Davis waited for the chance to back him up. ""It definitely increases my mindset defensively,"" said Davis, who sat out the previous game to rest his sore right shoulder. ""When the shot's not falling, I try to do the other things to help the team win."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 12 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter of the Western Conference-leading Lakers' third straight win despite a spirited effort by the undermanned Kings. The Lakers led 95-90 with three minutes left after Caldwell-Pope's third 3-pointer, but Bogdan Bogdanovic scored five straight points to tie it. James hit a layup with 1:50 left, but Bogdanovic eventually replied with a tying layup with 22 seconds to play. Barnes fouled James on the perimeter, and the shaky free-throw shooter smoothly hit both of his shots. Barnes then tried to drive for a tying shot, but Davis got his fourth block of the night in two-handed style while the Kings hoped in vain for a foul call on moderate contact. ""We played it to perfection,"" James said. ""When you have a shot-blocker the caliber of (Davis) protecting the rim, that just makes it that much tougher on Harrison."" Buddy Hield had 21 points and eight rebounds, and Bogdanovic added 18 points for the Kings in the LA return of Walton, who was fired by the Lakers last April after presiding over three consecutive losing seasons. ""One call changed the whole game, you know,"" said Hield, who appeared to be furious with the no-call at the buzzer. ""Could have gone either way. It be like that sometimes when the home team is favored all the time, especially when you're in LA. ... We've got something good going here, but this game, we should have won. I think we just got it stolen away from us."" Sacramento nearly pulled off the upset despite playing without De'Aaron Fox, who missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle, and Trevor Ariza, who sat out with a sore groin. ""We had some open looks we didn't knock down, but that is a big, talented team, and I thought our guys were light on numbers,"" Walton said. ""We had to put guys in that hadn't played much at all, and everyone that checked in fought and competed."" POSTER QUALITY James posted the highlight of the night in the second quarter with a drive and a high-flying dunk right on top of Nemanja Bjelica, who had regrettably tried to draw a charge. ""(James) saw a lane and put it on his head,"" Davis said. ""That's what LeBron does."" LUKE'S RETURN Walton's pregame introduction was greeted with an indistinguishable mix of boos and cheers of ""Luuuuuke"" for the coach who took over the Lakers in 2016. The former Lakers forward's teams posted three straight improved records, but his performance wasn't rated highly by former Lakers boss Magic Johnson or by general manager Rob Pelinka, who fired Walton just five days after Magic's surprise resignation last April. ""This is why this job is fun,"" Walton said. ""It's fun, it's stressful, it's hard, but this is what you, as a competitor, you love to do. And to be back in your old building and playing against the team you used to coach and play for, it's exciting."" TIP-INS Kings: Cory Joseph scored two points on 1-for-9 shooting in 23 minutes during his second start for the Kings. ... Ariza had treatment and painkilling shots over the past 24 hours, but the Kings decided to hold him out. ... Richaun Holmes scored nine of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. Lakers: Alex Caruso scored a season-high 10 points for the Lakers while playing extra minutes in place of injured starter Avery Bradley, who is out for at least a week with a hairline fracture in his right leg. Bradley got hurt Nov. 3 at San Antonio, but played four more games in pain before the injury was diagnosed. ... Caldwell-Pope started in Bradley's spot and went 1 for 4 in the first three quarters before he found his shot. Caruso started 1 for 6, but got back-to-back layups in the third quarter on passes from James.","401160816"
"CHICAGO --  Spencer Dinwiddie isnt trying to be Kyrie Irving. Still, he gave the Brooklyn Nets the spark they needed Saturday night. Dinwiddie scored 24 points and the Nets beat the Chicago Bulls 117-111 without Irving. Irving entered Saturday sixth in the NBA with 28.5 points per game but sat with a right shoulder injury. Brooklyn was just fine without the All-Star guard as Dinwiddie stepped into the starting lineup. Im not Kyrie, you know what I mean? Dinwiddie said. I just tried to gauge what needed to be done to win the game. Zach LaVine scored 36 points, but Chicago shot 35.2% from the field, 23.1% from 3-point range and committed 20 turnovers. Joe Harris had 22 points and eight assists for Brooklyn, which snapped a three-game skid. The short-handed Nets are also without Caris LeVert, whos recovering from right thumb surgery. Fifteen guys bonded together, and I dont think it was pretty, Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. Your best players out -- lets be honest -- and everybody steps it up a level. Its really a real boost to our morale. The lead changed hands five times in the fourth, and Brooklyn pulled ahead for good on Dinwiddies dunk with 8:01 remaining. Dinwiddie scored 20 points in the fourth alone. He took over, Atkinson said. Chicago briefly got within three points with just under 3 minutes left, and Lauri Markkanen hit a fading 3-pointer to make it 113-111 with 8.8 seconds remaining. But Harris made two free throws and the Bulls never got the ball with a chance to tie it. Wendell Carter Jr. added 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Bulls, who trailed by double digits early before using a 23-5 run in the second quarter to take the lead. Chicago led from then until the fourth quarter but allowed 43 points in the final period. They just wanted it more than us, LaVine said. They made more plays to close out the third quarter and start the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Atkinson said Irvings status for Mondays game against Indiana is unclear.  Six Nets scored in double figures. Bulls: Coach Jim Boylen said he expects F Otto Porter Jr.s return from a left foot sprain to be a matter of weeks, rather than months. He doesnt think Porter will need surgery. Ottos is a slow, meticulous process, Boylen said. BRICK CITY Brooklyn won despite shooting worse than 25% from 3-point range for the second straight game. The Nets shot 23.3% from beyond the arc after making just 21.1% at Denver on Thursday. Dinwiddie missed all four of his 3-point attempts. Ive been broke from 3 this year, so (Im) probably dragging our average down, Dinwiddie said. HEADED HOME The Nets finished their five-game road trip on a high note. Brooklyn had lost three of four to start the stretch and blew a 12-point halftime lead in Denver on Thursday. Last game of the road trip, we all know how difficult those games are, Atkinson said. We avoided that super bad stretch that weve had in the past two or three games, where we just have a train wreck of an eight minutes or a quarter that doesnt go right.","401160817"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Giannis Antetokounmpo rarely makes three 3-pointers in a game. Even on his way to the MVP award last season, the Milwaukee Bucks' 6-foot-11 superstar reached that mark only six times. He did it Saturday night in a 102-83 rout of the Indiana Pacers, finishing with 26 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. ""I think he's getting more and more comfortable with the 3-ball,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""The ball's in his hands a lot, so he's shooting them off the dribble. He continues to attack at a high rate, so we just want him to keep growing, keep letting it fly."" A shaky long-range shooter who was only 25.6% on 3s in the 2018-19 campaign, Antetokounmpo is 16 of 50 -- 32% -- from behind the arc in the Bucks' 9-3 start. With length and speed that make him almost unstoppable going to the basket, Antetokounmpo hopes to force defenders to respect the threat of a 3. ""I haven't seen it yet,"" he said. ""Eventually it might change, or it might not. Pretty much wide-open every shot I take from the top of the key or the wing."" His 3 from the top of the key at the first-quarter buzzer Saturday gave Milwaukee a 26-22 lead and set the tone on a night the Pacers endured their worst shooting performance of the season. Brook Lopez, who had 15 points and eight boards, blocked five shots to help limit Indiana to a season-low 32% from the field. Malcolm Brogdon, after joining Indiana in a July sign-and-trade deal with Milwaukee, missed his first chance at facing his former team. The early All-Star candidate developed a sore back during Friday's 111-102 loss at Houston. The good news for Indiana was the return of Myles Turner. Playing his first game since Oct. 30, Turner had 16 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks. ""I really don't know how to answer that,"" Turner said when asked if any pain lingers from his right ankle sprain. ""I'm still battling a little bit, but I felt good enough to play. That's all that matters."" The Bucks shot 45%. They went ahead by 15 points in the second quarter. Indiana then cut its 49-36 halftime deficit to 71-63 entering the fourth quarter. The Bucks restored their lead by opening the final period on a 10-2 run, including a pair of spot-up 3-pointers from Sterling Brown in the left corner. Brown finished with 10 points and six rebounds, complementing Donte DiVinzenco (14 points) and Eric Bledsoe (10 points, five assists). The only drama thereafter was that Antetokounmpo's run of consecutive 30-point, 10-rebound games ended at six. It was the NBA's longest such streak since Shaquille O'Neal's 11 in 2001. Budenholzer credited Indiana for playing hard ""no matter who's out there for them."" Backup point guard T.J. McConnell (sore right groin) was a late scratch, joining Brogdon, All-Star Victor Oladipo and sixth man Jeremy Lamb on Indiana's crowded inactive list. ""We're just having some bad breaks,"" coach Nate McMillan said. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo drew oohs and ahs on a highlight-reel dunk early in the second quarter. He started out dribbling beyond the 3-point line, drove left around JaKarr Sampson, picked up the ball above the foul line and soared for a left-handed jam over the outstretched arms of the trailing Sampson and help defender Goga Bitadze. ... Starting small forward Khris Middleton (left thigh contusion) missed his second straight game. Pacers: The Pacers were outscored 34-6 in the paint in the first half and 56-26 for the game. ... The team's video board showed Travis Best in attendance. Best averaged 8.9 points as the backup point guard on the Pacers' 2000 Eastern Conference championship team.","401160818"
"NEW YORK --  Another night, another late 3-pointer to win for the Charlotte Hornets. First, it was Malik Monk heaving a 26-footer to edge Detroit. It was Devonte' Graham's turn Saturday. Graham made his ninth 3-pointer of the game with 2.8 seconds remaining, finishing with 29 points to lead the Hornets to a 103-102 victory over the New York Knicks. The second-year player was just 2 for 12 from long distance Friday. ""I'm real confident in my shot. Worked on it a lot this summer,"" Graham said. ""My teammates telling to keep shooting it. Just knowing that they have that confidence in me, it would be selfish of me to pass up shots when they find me wide open."" After making a good defensive play that gave the Hornets the chance to either tie or win it, P.J. Washington, who scored 19 points, got the ball in front of the Knicks logo near midcourt with 6 seconds remaining. He made a routine bounce pass to Graham, who came in charging from the opposite half of the court. New York's Frank Ntilikina went to switch on Washington but raced back to cover Graham as the shot was hoisted up and sank through. ""It's a play we have executed before,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""You know, it's a type of play we executed in practice, we talk about and draw up and give our guys a lot of credit. In the heat of the battle they executed."" Terry Rozier had 16 and Marvin Williams added 13 off the bench for the Hornets, who got off to another slow start before picking it up when it most mattered. RJ Barrett scored 22 points and Mitchell Robinson had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who were coming off a victory over Dallas on Thursday. ""You never want to lose any game, but especially when you got a solid lead. But give them credit,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""They turned up their defense on us and they really shot the heck out of that 3 ball. I mean, 17 for 48 from 3. That's pretty impressive. And obviously the last one was the backbreaker."" Charlotte was down by 15 in the third quarter before taking the lead to start the final period on Graham's 3 for a 78-76 advantage. He then hit the final basket. For a second Ntilikina thought it would be Monk repeating the previous night's heroics before the ball found Graham's hands. ""He was (the) hot scorer,"" Ntilikina said. ""It was expected that (they would) draw a play for him."" TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte won at Detroit on Friday on Monk's winning 3-pointer after losing at Memphis on Ja Morant's layup with 0.7 seconds left. . Graham's previous career high for 3-pointers in a game was six against Minnesota on Oct. 25. Knicks: Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis scored 14 points apiece. . New York dropped to 1-4 at home. COULD'VE BEEN A KNICK Many figured Rozier to New York was a safe bet after the team missed out on signing Kyrie Irving. Instead, Charlotte signed Rozier to a three-year, $58 million deal and the Knicks settled for Elfrid Payton, who signed a two-year deal for $15 million and has not played since the fourth game of the season due to a strained right hamstring. ""For a second, I thought this was the place. I thought I was going to be a Knick,"" Rozier said. Rozier, who spent the first four years of his career in Boston and was vocal about seeking a higher role last season, is averaging career highs of 17 points, 4.9 assists and 42 percent shooting from the field. ""Other things happened and I ended up going to Charlotte,"" he said. ""It was the interest they showed in me. That was big. The organization believed in me. Why not?"" FRIENDS FOREVER Former Knick Willy Hernangomez wasn't too happy with the treatment the Madison Square Garden fans gave Kristaps Porzingis in his first game back in New York on Thursday. The former first-round pick, who was traded to Dallas last January, was booed during the lineup introductions and jeered even louder each time he missed touched the ball and missed a shot. Hernangomez, a former Knick himself who played his first NBA two seasons in New York before moving on to Charlotte, believes his close friend was deserving of a better welcoming. ""KP knows what happened and everything. The people just see what is public,"" Hernangomez said. ""But people can do whatever they want, support, boo, whatever. I just feel sad because KP is my brother and he did a lot for this city, the community, the team.""","401160819"
"MIAMI --  There were calls that Miami coach Erik Spoelstra didnt like. Just not many of them. The Heat set a franchise record by fouling only six times, Jimmy Butler shook off a pregame illness to flirt with a triple-double and Miami remained unbeaten at home by beating the undermanned New Orleans Pelicans 109-95 on Saturday night. They let us play, Spoelstra said. But then if there was any slightest infraction of a step or a travel or a dribble, they called all those. But I actually liked that we didnt let that get in the way. Kendrick Nunn scored 22 points, Bam Adebayo had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Butler added 16 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds for the Heat. Miami is 5-0 at home and 9-3 overall -- tying the best 12-game start in team history. Nickell Alexander-Walker made six 3-pointers and had 27 points for New Orleans, while ETwaun Moore scored 18 and Jrue Holiday scored 14 for the Pelicans. New Orleans came into the game with big injury problems -- and left with bigger ones. No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, along with JJ Redick, Jahlil Okafor, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Darius Miller all were unavailable for the game with various injuries. And by the time the first quarter was over, starters Frank Jackson and Derrick Favors were done for the night as well. Jackson left with pain on the left side of his neck after colliding with Miamis Meyers Leonard. Favors departed with back spasms. And that left the Pelicans with eight players for the games final 40 minutes. They hung tough, but the Heat eventually pulled away. I thought the guys played extremely hard, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. We just ran out of gas, to be honest with you. We just did not have enough people tonight. Nunn led Miami in scoring. His best play of the night might have been a pass. The sequence in the final seconds of the third quarter went like this: Kelly Olynyk double-teamed Holiday, forcing the ball from his hands. The Pelicans turned it over a couple seconds later, and Miamis Tyler Herro pushed the ball upcourt to Nunn near the basket. Nunn knew he couldnt get a shot off, so he kicked it out to Duncan Robinson for a 3-pointer that swished for a 78-65 lead as time expired. Just IQ, Nunn said. When you run the floor, know where your guys are at. And we made a great play. Robinson scored 15, Olynyk had 13 and Herro finished with 12 for Miami. TIP-INS Pelicans: The injuries are a huge reason for this, but the loss means New Orleans (3-9) matched the fourth-worst 12-game start in franchise history. They were 1-11 in 2004-05, 1-11 in 2015-16 and 2-10 in 2016-17. ... New Orleans was outrebounded 46-31. Heat: Miamis previous record for fouls in a game was nine, done twice. Miami committed only one foul in the first half, a franchise low for any half and the first one-foul half in the NBA since Houston had one in the first 24 minutes against Chicago on March 27, 2018. The previous Heat low for fouls in a half was two, done on five occasions. ... The Heat played without Justise Winslow (concussion), Goran Dragic (illness), KZ Okpala (Achilles), Dion Waiters (suspended) and Derrick Jones Jr. (left hip). WAITERS SPEAKS Waiters is in Syracuse this weekend, seeing the Orange play and seeking counsel from his college coach Jim Boeheim. One thing about Syracuse, whatever youre going through, the love is unconditional, Waiters told Syracuse.com. Waiters did not specifically address the Heat suspension, and will be away from the team until at least Nov. 30. AILING DUKIES There was a Duke alumni event for fans at the game Saturday night. They just didnt get to see one on the court. With Jacksons injury, it meant all six players from Duke on the rosters were done for the night. Williamson, Redick, Okafor, Ingram and Jackson are the Blue Devils on New Orleans roster, and Miami has Winslow. SERIES LEADERS Miami leads the series with the Pelicans 23-22 -- including playoffs. The regular-season series is tied 19-19.","401160820"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Undermanned and playing for the second consecutive night, the Houston Rockets still had plenty of reason to be confident. ""I would think it would give you confidence,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""You're playing with a bazooka out there."" A bazooka named James Harden. Harden unloaded Saturday night, scoring 49 points on a whopping 41 shots from the field to lead the short-handed Rockets to their seventh straight victory, 125-105 over the Minnesota Timberwolves. With Russell Westbrook resting and several key contributors injured, the Rockets needed Harden to shoulder an even bigger scoring load than usual. The 41 attempts are the most in his career, and the most in the NBA this season, surpassing the 37 Golden State's D'Angelo Russell took in an overtime loss Nov. 8 in the same building in Minnesota. ""It was a collective effort,"" Harden said. ""We've got six, seven guys out. So it could have been an easy game, where we just chalked it up and got ready for next game. We wanted to come here and win this game, and we showed it."" Harden made 16 of the 41 shots, going 8-for-22 from 3-point range. He was 9-of-11 on free throws. ""He scored [49] on 41 shots,"" Timberwolves forward Robert Covington said. ""That's what we want. But it's just the other guys hurt us. We followed the game plan with him."" Ben McLemore scored 20 points. Undrafted rookie Chris Clemons scored a career-high 19 off the bench for the Rockets, who broke open the game with a 9-0 run in the fourth quarter. Austin Rivers also scored 19 points. In addition to Westbrook, the Rockets were without center Clint Capela, guards Eric Gordon and Gerald Green and forward Danuel House Jr. And they were playing the second game of a back-to-back following Friday night's win over Indiana in Houston. ""There was a lot of heart,"" D'Antoni said. ""I think that's what we're more excited about, just the heart and the effort and what went into playing a back-to-back. That's a character win."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who also were short-handed. Andrew Wiggins missed his second consecutive game for personal reasons. Jake Layman made his first start of the season for Minnesota and scored a season-high 21 points. Covington had 17 points. ""I'm a no-excuse person,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Who's on the court is on the court. But we have to do more things to make teams like that uncomfortable. James Harden is a heck of a player. He's one of the best scorers you'll ever see. And he took 41 shots. I thought we made him work for some of them. But some of them, we didn't."" Harden scored 18 of his 30 first-half points in the first quarter. It was his highest-scoring first quarter of the season. Harden took 17 of his team's first 25 shots. He and the Rockets led by two at halftime despite trailing by as many as 11. ""We can't take any game for granted,"" Harden said. ""We showed that tonight. I think the first half we gave up too many points. Second half we locked back in. They barely got over 100 points. That's pretty much the goal every single game. Guys didn't look around. We manned up and got a win."" TIP-INS Rockets: Isaiah Hartenstein had a career-high 16 rebounds. The Rockets have held a double figure lead in 12 of 13 games this season. Nene also missed the game with a left adductor strain. Timberwolves: Guard Josh Okogie did not play because of left knee soreness. Guard Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain) remained out. First-round pick Jarrett Culver scored 13 points off the bench. The most points scored by a Minnesota opponent is 55 by San Antonio's Tony Parker in a double-overtime game on Nov. 5, 2008. INSTANT OFFENSE Clemons has played in seven of the 12 games this season. But he's used to scoring in bunches. He led the nation in scoring at 30.1 points per game as a senior at Campbell. He finished his career with the third-most points in NCAA Division I history. Saturday, the Rockets were plus-32 with Clemons on the court. ""He knows what he does, and he's very confident,"" D'Antoni said. ""We know he can shoot and all that, but his defense is good and he works hard. It was good. He's earned it.""","401160821"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic was upset when he missed four of 12 free throws in the first three quarters of Saturday nights game against Toronto. Then, he went 7 for 7 from the line in the fourth quarter as Dallas built on its one-point lead and the Mavericks went on to beat the Raptors 110-102. I dont expect to make all of them, but I want to make all of them, Doncic said Doncic finished with 26 points and 15 rebounds, including a career-best 15 free throws in a career-high 19 attempts. (Doncic) can do it all, said guard Fred VanVleet, who scored 24 points for Toronto. Hes a threat at every level, mid-range and 3, and kicking out to his teammates. Thought we did a good job on him tonight, just couldnt keep him off the free throw line. Raptors coach Nick Nurse seemed tired of seeing Doncic at the line. I thought that he got all his points from the foul line. I thought he was treated very well tonight, Nurse said Delon Wright finished with 15 points and banked in a fadeaway jumper with 5 seconds left in the third quarter to send Dallas into the fourth quarter with a 78-77 edge. Wright added six points against his former team in the fourth quarter. Kristaps Porzingis had 20 points and matched his career best with 15 rebounds for Dallas. I felt much more comfortable today, he said. It felt more natural today, not as forced. I just missed a lot of good looks, a lot of open shots, but Im happy we got the win. If I scored a few more of those open looks, it could have been a much easier game for us. Seth Curry scored 15 points, and Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber had 10 apiece. Doncic noted Klebers contribution on defense in a win over the defending NBA champions. A great win, Doncic said. We did a great job on Pascal Siakam. Maxi did a great job especially. Siakam, Torontos leading scorer, had 15 points on 10-for-24 shooting. Norman Powell led the Raptors with a season-high 26 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter. Matt Thomas scored 10. The Mavericks used a 15-0 run in the first quarter to transform a 10-3 deficit into an 18-10 lead. Kleber scored the first five points, and Finney-Smith ended the run with a layup 3 minutes later. Dallas led 32-22 after the first quarter, with Doncic scoring 14 points. VanVleet had 10 for Toronto, which shot 30% (6 for 20) from the floor. The Raptors roared back in the second quarter, shooting 61% (14 for 23) and outscoring the Mavericks 38-21 for a 60-53 halftime lead. TIP-INS Raptors: In Matt Thomass ninth NBA game, he scored a career-high 10 points, all in the second quarter. He had scored eight twice before. ... Norman Powell had a chance for a 4-point play in the fourth quarter, but he missed the free throw after Dallass Jalen Brunson fouled him on the shot. Mavericks: A video review showed that a shot by Kristaps Porzingis in the second quarter left his hand after 24 seconds expired, so 2 points were deducted from the scoreboard. ... The game matched the NBAs fifth-leading scorer Luka Doncic (28.7ppg.) and eighth-leading scorer Pascal Siakam (27.2 ppg.). TOUGH STRETCH The Mavericks are on a homestand that consists of games against the four teams -- Raptors, Spurs, Warriors and Cavaliers -- that have won the last six NBA titles. This is a tough homestand, coach Rick Carlisle said. Its a great opportunity, certainly, to be home. Well find out a lot. I dont know exactly what it will tell me or us, but the opportunity to compete at home in front of your fans, its a big deal and its a big opportunity. MISSING YOU The Raptors went 3-2 on a five-game trip, even though C Serge Ibaka (sprained right ankle) and G Kyle Lowry (thumb injury), averaging 35 points per game between them, were injured in the second game. Three-and-two and we lost two of our most important players, said Norman Powell, who took Lowrys place. Were not holding our heads though. Were going to get in the gym and do better, correct our mistakes.","401160822"
"SAN ANTONIO -- Tim Duncan was back in charge in San Antonio, and the Spurs were flourishing under his leadership again. Duncan was directing players on defensive assignments, encouraging them and providing needed leadership. But in the end, he couldn't provide the same late-game heroics from the bench that he long did on the court. CJ McCollum scored 32 points and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Spurs 121-116 on Saturday night to spoil Duncan's first shot at coaching following Gregg Popovich's ejection. Duncan took over just 13 games into his first season as an assistant coach. Popovich was asked if he considered having Becky Hammon take over to make history as the first woman to lead an NBA team. ""I'm not here to make history,"" Popovich said. LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and 13 rebounds, but the Spurs lost their fifth straight and fell to 5-8. Damian Lillard added 22 points and Hassan Whiteside had 21 points for Portland (5-8), which rallied from a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter to snap a four-game skid in San Antonio. ""We've blown leads before, so we kind of know what to expect,"" McCollum said. ""Once you do it, you've got to stay grounded, focus on the little stuff."" Before the game, Popovich said coaching could only go so far and it was up to each player to take responsibility for his own mistakes and performance during this losing streak. Popovich put that responsibility squarely on the Spurs when he was ejected early in the third quarter. Popovich was ejected after walking onto the court to berate official Jason Goldenberg over a non-call. Popovich calmly walked off the court following his first ejection of the season. Duncan, Hammon and Will Hardy coached by committee, but it was Duncan calling the plays and yelling out instruction. ""It was cool,"" Spurs guard Bryn Forbes said. ""It didn't really feel like a huge difference. I think he did a good job. He took control. He helped lead us to a big lead."" San Antonio took a 111-104 lead with 4 minutes remaining but couldn't hold on. Portland took a 114-111 lead on Rodney Hood's three-point play on a left-handed hook and foul on DeMar DeRozan. DeRozan was later called for a charge against Hood that was changed to a pushing foul after a coaching challenge by the Spurs. The Blazers took a 116-113 lead with 37 seconds following the review. DeRozan was still upset by the call after the game, stating Hood hit him in the face prior to any possible push off. ""As soon as we say something out on the court, we get a tech,"" DeRozan said. ""We're held responsible for things we say about the refs, but when refs cost us the game, I don't know what we get. An apology later on after it's reviewed?"" After trailing by 23 points in the opening minute of the second quarter, the Spurs went on a 34-15 run capped by Aldridge's sixth 3-pointer. Aldridge had 10 3-pointers last season. The Spurs stormed to a 96-90 lead late in the third quarter behind a series of energy plays that drew thunderous cheers from the previously restrained crowd. ""We've got to play the way we played after Pop got kicked out the full game,"" DeRozan said. ""Fighting against bad calls, so many things out there, we just listened, went out there and played hard."" Bryn Forbes added 17 points and DeRozan and Rudy Gay added 16 apiece. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland's bench had 25 points led by eight each from Mario Hezonja and Kent Bazemore. ... The Blazers lost 113-110 in San Antonio on Oct. 28 when Lillard's 3-pointer at the buzzer rattled out of the rim. Spurs: The Spurs entered the season with a losing record for only 65 days since 1998. ... Aldridge's career high for 3-pointers is 37, set in 2015, and his highest 3-point percentage is 41%, set in 2017. MUSCLE MELO Lillard and McCollum both reached out to Carmelo Anthony after he agreed to sign with the Trail Blazers. Anthony has not played since Nov. 8, 2018, with the Houston Rockets, but he spent the past summer working out with McCollum and others. ""He looks like he's changed his body a little bit,"" McCollum said. ""Started lifting more on his legs, his lower half. He was dunking this summer. He doesn't usually dunk, so that's how I knew he was feeling good. I don't know if it was because of the work or because he's been off or a combination, but he looked like he had new life, more bounce in his step.""","401160823"
"Paul George continues to show out in his first home game in LA and celebrates another 3-pointer with a Jordan-like shrug. (0:22) LOS ANGELES --  Paul George made history in his Clippers home debut even though he considered it mere practice after missing the first 11 games of the season. George scored 37 points in 20 minutes, becoming the first NBA player to score that many in fewer than 21 minutes, and Los Angeles led all the way in routing the Atlanta Hawks 150-101 on Saturday night. ""He knows I had him on a time limit, so he's trying to get it all in,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. It was the Clippers' largest margin of victory ever and their total points scored were the second-most in franchise history. ""We had another 30, 40 points that didn't play tonight,"" George said, referring to Kawhi Leonard. The anticipated first game with George and Leonard in the lineup together didn't happen when Leonard sat out with a left knee contusion. But the Clippers didn't need both of their new superstars on a night when George tied his career high with six 3-pointers and made all 11 of his free throws. ""It's a dream come true to be able to do this at home in front of family and friends,"" said George, who is from Palmdale, north of Los Angeles. ""I'm just happy to be playing basketball again."" George was clearly having fun in the fourth when he stole the ball, dribbled down and tossed it off the glass, setting up Montrezl Harrell for a two-handed dunk that ignited the crowd and pushed the Clippers' lead to 36 points. ""This is practice for me to get in time with my guys and a catch a rhythm out there,"" said George, who spent the first couple weeks of the season rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgeries. ""I got new shoulders. They haven't felt this healthy in a long time."" George started the fourth quarter and hit a 3-pointer, having asked to accumulate more minutes since the team has had little practice time lately. But when George tripped, Rivers had seen enough and removed him. It wasn't soon enough for the Hawks. ""You saw a guy step out on the court that had no rust,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Two nights after scoring 33 in his debut at New Orleans, George scored 15 of the Clippers' first 22 points in a six-minute span. They led by 17 and shot 59 percent in the opening quarter. George is the first player in franchise history to score 30-plus points in his first two games with the team. The Hawks scored 11 straight to close within four early in the second quarter, the closest they would come the rest of the game. The Clippers answered with an 18-6 run, fueled by George's nine points, to go back up by 17 again. George had 25 points at halftime when the Clippers led 74-62, shooting 52% and making all 16 of their free throws. Leonard also sat out on Thursday when George made his Clippers debut in a loss to the Pelicans. Trae Young had 20 points for the Hawks, who dropped their second in a row. They trailed by 52 points in the fourth. ""It was just bad effort,"" Young said, ""and you can't do it in this league or you'll get killed every night."" The Clippers dominated in nearly every category, with their bench outscoring the Hawks' reserves 81-35. Los Angeles made 17 3-pointers and hit 33 of 35 free throws.

"CLEVELAND --  The Philadelphia 76ers made certain there was no late drama against the Cleveland Cavaliers this time. A few days after a one-point victory over the Cavaliers at home, the 76ers jumped ahead early and steadily built the lead for a 114-95 rout Sunday. Cleveland nearly pulled off an upset in Philadelphia on Tuesday before falling 98-97, but the 76ers quickly ended any hope of a repeat. Tobias Harris scored 27 points and Joel Embiid had 14. Ben Simmons had 10 points and 11 assists, and the 76ers had six players score in double figures. Philadelphia went ahead midway through the first quarter and pulled away, shooting 67% in the half. The lead reached 75-44 early in the third quarter. ""We needed a win and we came out with great energy and used our defense to fuel everything,"" said Harris, who played with a jammed left pinky. ""When you get high-percentage shots and play good defense, it's a good combination."" The 76ers had dropped five of seven going into the game, including losses in Orlando and Oklahoma City, but finished their road trip on a high note. ""How people respond to losing and how they play is an interesting snapshot,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""For the most part, the guys didn't let up. Defensively, we came out with a sting. The partnership of all the pieces was effective."" Philadelphia shredded Cleveland's defense with 33 assists on 46 baskets. Harris was 12 of 14 from the field, missing only one of 12 2-point attempts. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love took a hard fall after being flattened by Furkan Korkmaz while shooting in the lane in the first quarter. Love, who injured his right knee, got up after being on the floor for a couple of moments and gave the thumbs-up sign to the crowd. Love, who scored 12 points in 25 minutes, expects to play Monday night when the Cavaliers visit New York. ""My knee was bent all the way and when I hit the floor all that weight kind of jammed up on me,"" he said. ""It's going to pretty sore tomorrow. Nothing serious. I'm going to have to treat it a lot. Hopefully it will be gone in a few days."" Collin Sexton had 17 points for Cleveland, which has lost three straight and opened a stretch of five games in seven days. The Cavaliers were ahead of the 76ers by five points late in Tuesday's game, but couldn't hold the lead. Love missed an open 3-pointer on the final possession. ""This isn't just a tough loss like it was in Philly, where we competed,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""We got blown out in our own arena on a Sunday afternoon in front of a great crowd. It measures you a little bit."" Brown is looking forward to the 76ers playing 13 of their next 18 at home. ""How can that not be fantastic?"" he said.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Boston Celtics were an unlucky bounce away from extending an historic start to their season. Instead, the Sacramento Kings walked away with a huge victory. Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points, Richaun Holmes hit two free throws with 13.3 seconds remaining to give Sacramento the lead, and the Kings snapped the Celtics' 10-game winning streak with a 100-99 victory Sunday. Marcus Smart had a chance to win it for Boston, but his runner in the lane bounced around the rim before trickling off as the buzzer sounded. ""The ball just felt like it sat on the rim forever,'' Smart said. ""I thought it was going in. I think everybody thought it was going in and it just rolled out. It was just one of those games.'' The Celtics (10-2) lost for the first time since their Oct. 23 opener at Philadelphia. The only other team in NBA history to drop its opener and then rattle off 10 consecutive wins was the 1979-80 Milwaukee Bucks. Harrison Barnes had 13 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 12 points and 10 assists for the Kings (5-7), who lost a similarly close game two nights earlier to the Lakers in Los Angeles. Hield hit seven 3-pointers and finished just two points off his career high. But Kings coach Luke Walton was most fired up about Hield's defense on a day Sacramento held Boston to 42% shooting (34-for-82) and just 18 points in the first quarter. ""Buddy obviously was spectacular,'' Walton said. ""We all know he can score, and he's going to have nights like this. But I thought he was so committed to the team winning. The way he was defending, just his all-around game.'' Jaylen Brown scored 18 points and Kemba Walker had 15 for Boston. Jayson Tatum and Daniel Theis each added 14. Down four to start the second half, the Celtics outscored the Kings 29-21 in the third quarter to take a 75-71 advantage entering the fourth. With 13 seconds remaining and Boston up 99-98, Holmes and Smart went to the floor battling for a rebound and Smart was called for a foul that set up Holmes for the free throws. Celtics coach Brad Stevens challenged the foul call but it was upheld upon a replay review. TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum came in having scored 20-plus points in seven of the first 11 games. He had just four over the first three quarters Sunday. In the fourth, he did convert a three-point play and drilled a 3-pointer during a sequence that gave Boston a 93-88 lead. Kings: Before the game, Walton didn't offer much reaction to the NBA announcing that a key foul on Barnes on Friday, which sent LeBron James to the line to sink two free throws that helped the Lakers pull out the win, should have been called an offensive foul on James. ""I don't care, I don't look at it,'' Walton said. ""Our mindset is 'What's next? What are we doing next?''' YOU FORGOT SOMETHING Kings center Dewayne Dedmon checked into the game in the first quarter and took the court, only to realize he hadn't removed his warm-up pants. Dedmon quickly discarded them and enjoyed a nice game off the bench with seven points, four rebounds and a block. BOGDANOVIC'S BIG DAY With point guard De'Aaron Fox out with a severe ankle sprain, Bogdanovic takes on a more crucial role in Sacramento's backcourt. Along with his 12 points and 10 assists, he didn't commit a single turnover in 31 minutes.","401160826"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Markelle Fultz is fitting in nicely with the Orlando Magic. The former No. 1 overall pick had 19 points and the deciding defensive play in a 125-121 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. Nikola Vucevic had 30 points and 17 rebounds and Evan Fournier added 25 points and nine assists, but the Magic nearly squandered an 18-point fourth quarter lead before Fultz stopped Washington's rally. Fultz made all six shots from the field in the first half, including a pair of 3-pointers, and finished 8 for 10 from the field. However, it was his defensive play that decided the game. With Orlando leading 119-116, Fultz stole a pass and was fouled as he dunked the ball with 36.1 seconds left. His free throw finished the 3-point play and gave Orlando a six-point cushion that stood up for the team's fourth win in its last five games. ""That was definitely fun,"" said Fultz, who was drafted No. 1 by Philadelphia 76ers in 2017 before being traded to Orlando midway through last season. ""You live for moments like that when the game is on the line and you're out competing to see what everybody is made of. I love it that I got a chance to make a big-time play and I finished it off."" Orlando needed it to withstand a couple of fourth-quarter rallies by Washington and its 3-point shooting team. The Wizards made 10 of 15 3-pointers in the final period and scored 44 points, but couldn't play enough defense to overtake Orlando. Bradley Beal scored 34 points and had eight assists for Washington, which absorbed its fourth loss in five games. The Wizards got 21 points from C.J. Miles and 15 from Davis Bertans. ""We are 10 games in (to the season) now so we have to dial back the amount of excuses we have,"" Beal said. ""We compete hard enough to win every game. We are top five on offense, so we know that's not the problem. We just have to get stops."" The Magic had to put down two furious rallies from the Wizards in the fourth quarter. Washington was down 95-78 early in the fourth quarter, but closed to within 97-91 on a 3-pointer from Moritz Wagner with 7:23 left in the game The Magic lost both backup point guards, D.J. Augustin (dislocated finger) and Michael Carter-Williams (hip), to injuries in the second quarter, but Fultz picked up the slack. TIP INS Wizards: Washington missed its first seven 3-point attempts. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Jamal Murray didnt take long to erase a bad night against Brooklyn. Murray, who was missed 10 of 11 shots against the Nets last time out, connected on his first four on Sunday en route to a season-high 39 points as the Nuggets dominated the Memphis Grizzlies for a 131-114 victory. It was just preparation, Murray said of the difference. I mean, I know I didnt shoot well (against Brooklyn), so I wanted to bounce back. Start out by being aggressive. Miss or make. Murray added eight assists with no turnovers on the night, while connecting on 14 of 24 shots, including 7 of 12 from 3-point range. Murray didnt play in the fourth quarter after Denver held a 108-80 lead after three. I had a feeling he was going to come out not only being aggressive, but shooting the ball at a high level, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Hes too good of a shooter to continue shooting the way he had been recently. Paul Millsap had 23 points and Juancho Hernangomez finished with 15. Jerami Grant added 12 points as Denver won for the sixth time in the last seven, scoring a season high in points. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 22 points, including a career-high five 3-pointers. Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Brandon Clarke finished with 19 points, including 10 in the fourth quarter when the game was out of reach. A promising start offensively for Memphis, led by Valanciunas, eventually turned as the Nuggets defense tightened. Ja Morants flashy moves in the paint, along with other inside shots by Grizzlies shooters ended up returned by Denver rim protectors. Denvers seven blocks, coupled with nine Memphis turnovers in the first half, translated to a 72-49 Nuggets lead at the half. The major damage came in the second quarter with Denver outscoring Memphis 44-17. They raised their level to an elite level, and our guys just couldnt really catch that second gear. It just wasnt our day, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: We tried to claw back here and there, but that second quarter kind of got away from us. Murray already had 26 points by halftime, and characteristic of a young Memphis team, the Grizzlies simply didnt have the experience to counter the Nuggets burst. Denver would eventually lead by as many as 33. Tonight, they just made shots, said Morant, who had 13 points and six assists to go with four turnovers. The Nuggets had 29 fast-break points to only 10 from Memphis, much of Denvers a result of a defense that recorded 10 blocked shots and forced 16 Grizzlies turnovers leading to 25 points. I think thats a fun way to play when you can play defense, when you can rebound and get out and run before they set their defense, Malone said. When you are running and sharing the ball, it is even that much more fun, so it was great. TIP-INS Nuggets: Gave up 100 points for only the second time in the last seven games.  Will Barton, who was listed as probable after having left adductor tightness against the Nets, started but was limited to six points.  Previous high for points this season was 121 against Atlanta on Nov. 12.  Hernangomez was 5 of 6 from the field, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Had 36 assists, a season high. Grizzlies: Valanciunas has reached double figures in 12 straight games.  Memphis has made at least 10 3-pointers in seven straight games, matching the franchise record set in March of last season.  Entered the game leading the NBA with 55 points in the paint per game. Managed only 40 against the Nuggets. TEAMMATE TRANSLATION Hernangomez, in his fourth season out of Spain, was praised by Malone for the energy he brings to the Nuggets. Malone said the 6-foot-9 forward is contagious with the energy. Hes one of the best teammates Ive ever had, Murray said. Hes always the first one to stand by the bench and clap for his teammates and cheer. Hes always talking, even if he cant talk English.","401160828"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jrue Holiday looked to find J.J. Redick shot opportunities early and often against Golden State, and Reddick validated Holiday's approach in short order. ""I'm looking for him every time,"" said Holiday, who in the first quarter assisted on five Redick jump shots, four of them 3-pointers. ""It's not even if he takes the shot; he attracts so many bodies that he gets other guys shots. ""But when he makes them with like three people on him, it's crazy,"" Holiday continued. ""It's actually really cool to see."" Redick scored 26 points, hitting his sixth 3-pointer of the game from the left corner with 1:09 left, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Warriors 108-100 on Sunday night. ""I'm going into a game with zero expectations and agendas,"" Redick said. ""Some nights it's your night and some nights it's not. ... I'm just going to continue to play my game -- and then they leave me open in the corner."" Holiday had 22 points despite a difficult night shooting the ball and also had nine assists and eight rebounds. Jaxson Hayes had 10 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in the first start of his career. Eric Paschall scored 30 points for injury-depleted Golden State, which has lost seven straight. Ky Bowman scored 19 points and Glenn Robinson III added 14. Draymond Green helped out at point guard but didn't have a good night statistically, finishing with seven points, six rebounds and four assists against three turnovers. ""There are some funky lineups that are out there because of our injuries and we're short on shooting,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""If you can't spread the floor shooting, you've got to be able to play with pace and make all the cuts. You've got to play faster. You have to get stops defensively so you can run. ""I didn't think we did a very good job of making New Orleans guard,"" Kerr added. ""We just kind of took quick shots."" Golden State trailed most of the game, but rallied from a third-quarter deficit as large as 17 to get as close as 77-74 on Marquese Chriss' tomahawk jam over Nicolo Melli. But Holiday -- who shot 4 of 16 through three quarters before making five of his last seven -- responded with free throws, two driving layups and a turnaround fade in succession to push the Pelicans' lead back to double digits. ""It took a lot to just win this game,"" Redick said. ""Any time we got a lead, they just kept coming and I'm proud of our group for finishing them off."" Nickeil Alexander-Walker hit five 3s and finished with 19 points for New Orleans, while Melli was 5 of 7 from deep and scored 16. Melli even hit a 3 as he was fouled for a four-point possession, and New Orleans combined for 18 3s in all (on 46 attempts). ""Even with their guys injured, they still had shooting all over the floor,"" Kerr said. ""We didn't give up dunks. We didn't give up layups. They sprung free for open 3s all night long and we couldn't score at the other end."" TIP-INS Warriors: Chriss had 10 points. ... The Warriors shot 7 of 25 (28 percent) from 3-point range. ... Green was called for a technical foul, his fourth of the season, while waiting for the Pelicans' Hayes to shoot free throws. Pelicans: Coach Alvin Gentry went with his 10th different starting lineup of the season -- and seventh in the last seven games. Hayes, drafted eighth overall last summer, responded to his first start with a soaring block from behind on Robinson to thwart a fast break in the first quarter, drawing a raucous ovation from the crowd. ... E'Twaun Moore scored 10 points. TWO-NIGHT TEAR Alexander-Walker, drafted 17th overall last summer, has made 11 3-pointers in the span of two games, having made six in a career-high, 27-point effort in Miami on Saturday. ""The game's slowing down for Nickeil,"" Redick said. ""Secondly, to see the ball go in the basket is a big thing. It gives you confidence, obviously, and helps with your rhythm."" INJURED LIST Stephen Curry (broken left hand) and Klay Thompson (left knee) were just the beginning of the Warrior's injury list. Also out were guard D'Angelo Russell (right hand sprain), forward Kevon Looney (Neuropathy), guard Damion Lee (broken right hand), forward Alen Smailagic (right ankle sprain) and guard Jacob Evans III (strained groin).

"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James wasnt about to send Kobe Bryant home disappointed. With the former Lakers great sitting courtside, the teams current ranking superstar scored 12 of his 33 points during a breathtaking opening nine minutes for Los Angeles, which raced to a 25-point lead and handed the Atlanta Hawks their second ugly loss in 24 hours at Staples Center, 122-101 on Sunday night. I'm just trying to put on a show for him and give him a reason to be like, OK, we might come to another game, James said. The 34-year-old James said it was fantastic to play in front of Bryant, who helped the Lakers win five NBA titles during his 20-year career. I know he came to a game last year, James said. Just having him in the building, knowing what he did to this franchise, and for me and my teammates what it means to be a part of Laker Nation, the Laker family, it's a beautiful thing. I was one of the kids who had the chance to come out straight out of high school. He did it and I was just watching him. It's just so surreal for me, a kid from Akron to be able to have a guy like Kobe take time out of his day. Even at this point in my career it's still special. James joined the Lakers last season. I became part of the family and he welcomed me with open arms as well as everyone else. Just to have that support from one of the greatest Lakers to ever play is just special to me, James said. In a quarter full of highlights, James biggest play provided his first points. After JaVale McGee blocked Jabari Parkers shot, James grabbed the ball, passed to Danny Green and took the return pass for a slam dunk that brought the crowd to its feet two minutes in. James added two layups, a 3-point shot and a three-point play to help propel the Lakers to their 25-point lead with 3:17 still to play in the opening quarter. He also fed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope for consecutive baskets. James finished with 12 assists for his 11th double-double this season. Hes been at just an extraordinarily high level and dominating, coach Frank Vogel said of James. His effort on the defensive end has really spread throughout the group and the group has really bought into being dominant on the defensive end of the floor. We saw that in the first quarter with how we controlled the game from the start. Offensively, the shot making, his decision making, zero turnovers, 12 assists, I mean are you kidding me? The Hawks were routed 150-101 on Saturday night by the Clippers, who played without Kawhi Leonard. Kyle Kuzma scored 17 points in the Lakers 11th win in 12 games. Rajon Rondo had 15, Anthony Davis 14, Caldwell-Pope 13 and Green and Alex Caruso 11 apiece. Davis had five of the Lakers 14 blocked shots. Trae Young scored 31 for the Hawks, who lost four of five on a swing through the West. Cam Reddish had 13 while Allen Crabbe, Parker and DeAndre Hunter each scored 11. After falling behind by 25, the Hawks stopped the Lakers onslaught by going on a 13-0 run to close to 34-22. They got to 40-30 before the Lakers pulled away again. Green put an emphatic stamp on a 69-41 halftime lead when he swooped in to corral James missed shot for a slam dunk with 11 seconds before the buzzer. James then hit consecutive 3-pointers for the Lakers first points of the second half and added a nice fallaway jumper. Its tough when you cant make shots, Young said. Give a lot of credit to them. Theyre one of the best defensive teams in the league. Weve just got to be better knocking down shots, working on our game and trying to be more crafty around defenses like them. They were making a lot of blocked shots, making a lot of big plays. We had a lot of things that didnt go our way. Thats how our seasons been. Well get down big and we have to fight so hard to get back into the game that we take all the energy out of ourselves and hard to get ourselves back into the game. TIP-INS Hawks: Crabbe had a four-point play in the first quarter when he hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Troy Daniels. He made the free throw to cut the deficit to 34-20. ... The Hawks have lost three straight and six of seven. Lakers: With Avery Bradley out, Caldwell-Pope earned a second straight start and third of the season after scoring 16 points in 99-97 victory over Sacramento on Friday night. ... Dwight Howard energized the crowd when he blocked Parkers shot early in the second quarter. ... Bryant was shown on the big screen with 4:25 left in the first half and rose to acknowledge a standing ovation. UNIQUE DOUBLE Back at Staples Center less than 24 hours after absorbing a 49-point loss to the Clippers, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce asked if he preferred the games were split up. Yes, he said. Back-to-back on the road is tough no matter who the opponent is. Obviously you have two special teams with a lot of special talent with both of the L.A. teams. It makes it extremely difficult.","401160830"
"NEW YORK --  A week made a big difference for the New York Knicks. Julius Randle scored 30 points, Marcus Morris Sr. added 23 and the Knicks beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 123-105 Monday night to avenge a 21-point home loss eight days prior. R.J. Barrett added 15 points and Damyean Dotson had 11 for New York. In their first meeting November 10, the Cavaliers came into Madison Square Garden and posted a 108-87 victory. This time, they never led. ""We got off to a good start,"" Randle said. ""I think the start was everything. We started out 4 of 14 last week and never got going."" Kevin Porter Jr. led Cleveland with 18 points. Collin Sexton and Alfonzo McKinnie each had 14. Kevin Love, who had 17 points in the first meeting, did not play due to back tightness, the first game he's missed this season. ""He's a great player, a champion,"" Barrett said ""Having him out was, I wouldn't say great. But, we didn't have Mitch (Mitchell Robinson) last time so it's even now."" The Knicks scored the first four points and never trailed. Randle had 15 points in the first quarter as the Knicks built two 16-point leads before settling for a 32-20 advantage at the end of the quarter. The Cavaliers pulled within 36-31, but the Knicks followed with a 24-8 run and took a 60-39 lead on Randle's 3-pointer with 2:26 left in the half. Randle had 23 points at halftime as the Knicks took a 64-51 advantage into the break. Cleveland is also without Larry Nance Jr., who is out with a left thumb sprain. ""We were missing two really good players,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""We are not real deep as it is. We were missing one of our best, if not our best player, and our power sixth man. And with a team that is not deep, that is a really big difference."" The Cavaliers never got closer. The Knicks scored the first six points of the second half and increased their lead to 90-65 on Dotson's long jumper with 3:25 remaining in the third. The Knicks led 94-71 after three quarters and extended their lead to a game-high 27 points on Randle's bucket with 9:17 remaining. Cleveland only managed to get within 16 in the game's final minute. Jordan Clarkson (13), Brandon Knight (12) and Darius Garland (10) also reached double figures in points for Cleveland. ""All of these wins feel good,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Obviously, we didn't like the last time they came here."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: After shooting at least 80% from the foul line in six straight games, their longest streak since 2017, the Cavaliers shot a dismal 53.3% (16 of 30). ... Porter replaced Love in the starting lineup. Knicks: No Knick has reached double-digit assists in a game this season. Barrett's nine against the Bulls on November 12 is a season high for the team. ... New York did not commit a turnover in the first quarter while pressuring the Cavaliers into nine. ... The Knicks' 10 blocks tied a season high. They also recorded 10 against Orlando on October 30. WELCOME MAT Heading into Monday night, the Cavaliers had won their last 11 games against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, the longest winning streak ever recorded by a visiting team at MSG, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. They hadn't lost to the Knicks in New York since suffering a 117-86 blowout on January 30, 2014. MAKING A BEILEIN TO MSG Beilein is in his comfort zone at Madison Square Garden. His teams had won 10 straight games there, including his first game as the Cavaliers' coach on November 10. His Michigan teams won their last nine meetings at MSG, including the Big Ten Tournament Championship in 2018. Before Monday, the last time a Beilein-led team lost at MSG was on November 21, 2008, in the 2K Sports Classic against Duke (71-56).","401160831"
"NEW YORK --  The Pacers relied on the Holiday brothers to overcome some injuries in their backcourt. Aaron Holiday finished with career highs of 24 points and 13 assists, Justin Holiday scored 20 points and the Pacers cruised to a 115-86 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. ""It's a blessing he's on the team with us and we're two brothers in the NBA, let alone in the same team. It's crazy,"" Aaron Holiday said. Indiana was playing without Malcolm Brogdon and Jeremy Lamb, but the backcourt tandem of the Holiday brothers was effective, especially after coach Nate McMillan was successful on a replay challenge late in the third quarter. Aaron Holiday and Justin Holiday combined to hit three consecutive baskets to put the Pacers ahead 82-65 with 1:09 remaining in the period. ""They're playing great. They're playing with a lot of confidence,"" Domantas Sabonis said. ""Teams are doubling us, so we're just kicking it out to open shooters and they're knocking shots with confidence."" Sabonis had 16 points and a career-high 18 rebounds, while T.J. Warren added 19 for the Pacers, who were coming off consecutive losses to Houston and Milwaukee. Brooklyn was on a 7-0 run and within 75-62 with 3:10 left in the third quarter when Justin Holiday signaled to McMillan to challenge a call that the Pacers had lost the ball out of bounds. The call was overturned and the Pacers soon after pushed their lead back to 18. ""There is a style that we want to play and we want to make sure that we are connected out there and playing together,"" McMillan said. ""We talked about our three Ts and being together and showing some real toughness and trusting each other, regardless of who's in uniform. They've been able to do that and win some games."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 28 points and Jarrett Allen finished with 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, who played without Kyrie Irving for a second straight game and were held to their lowest point total of the season. Irving injured his shoulder while the Nets went 2/3 on their road trip. ""Below-average teams are inconsistent and that's what we are right now,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Nets didn't get a boost from being home, scoring a season-low 18 points in the first quarter and then following it up with just 17 in the second period to trail 59-35 at halftime. Indiana was sluggish early before tying it at 18-all. The Pacers then blitzed the Nets with a 11-0 run to start the second quarter, getting seven straight points from Warren while opening up a 29-18 advantage. Indiana later outscored Brooklyn by 30-15 and led by as many as 28 points with 28 seconds remaining in the half when Naz Mitrou-Long sealed a 13-0 spurt with an uncontested layup. Nets guard Joe Harris questioned the team's effort in the second quarter. ""There's a lot of it that's out of our your control when you're playing, but the things that are in your control are competing every possession, playing hard every possession, having that sense of energy,"" Harris said. ""The ownership, the pride, a lot of that stuff isn't there for us right now."" The Pacers improved to 2-0 this season against the Nets. Both of the wins have come at the Barclays Center. TIP-INS Pacers: Besides Brogdon (back) and Lamb (ankle), the Pacers were also without T.J. McConnell (groin). . Mitrou-Long had a career-high 12 points off the bench. Nets: Garrett Temple started in place of Irving and finished with 10 points and six rebounds. LETS JUST WAIT SOME MORE Atkinson said Irving is not at the point yet where he can go out on the court and play due to his shoulder injury. The team chose to be cautious with Irving as it is already without the services of G Caris LeVert, who underwent right thumb surgery last Thursday. ""That's the conclusion we came to for tonight's game,"" Atkinson said. ""Best that he didn't play."" Irving leads the Nets with 28.5 points and 7.2 assists per game.","401160832"
"TORONTO --  Raptors forward OG Anunoby put up an eye-catching line before catching an elbow to his right eye. After escaping serious injury for the second time in four games, Anunoby said he's considering playing with more protection moving forward. Anunoby scored a career-high 24 points before being jabbed in the eye, Pascal Siakam had 20 and Toronto beat Charlotte 132-96 Monday night, snapping a two-game losing streak against the Hornets. Norman Powell scored 17 points, rookie Terence Davis got all of his career-high 16 in the fourth quarter and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 15 as the Raptors posted their biggest margin of victory of the season and remained unbeaten in five home games. Anunoby made 6 of 7 attempts in the third, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Toronto coach Nick Nurse said Anunoby ""jump-started"" the Raptors by scoring 16 points in the quarter before getting poked in the right eye by Charlotte's Nicolas Batum while defending a drive to the basket. Anunoby sat out Wednesday's win at Portland after being struck in the eye by former teammate Kawhi Leonard during the first quarter of a road loss to the Clippers two days earlier. ""I wish they'd catch the guy who does it once in a while,"" Nurse said, upset that Anunoby did not get a foul call on either play. ""That's two games he's been hit in the head and nobody sees anything."" Anunoby returned to start Saturday's loss at Dallas, scoring eight points in 32 minutes. Anunoby went to the locker room for treatment after being poked by Batum, returning to the bench early in the fourth. The Raptors said Anunoby was available to play again, but he sat out the rest of the game as Toronto maintained a comfortable lead. As they watched the fourth together, Hollis-Jefferson suggested Anunoby try the mask made famous by a villain from the Batman movie series. ""We were joking about that on the bench towards the end of the game like `Hey dude, you're going to have to wear the Bane mask pretty soon just to keep people out of your eyes,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. Anunoby said he'll experiment with a different form of eye protection at Tuesday's practice and might wear something for Wednesday's game against Orlando. ""If it's what's best, I'll wear them, but we'll see,"" Anunoby said when asked about donning protective goggles. Last October 19, Anunoby wore goggles for one quarter of a game against Boston two days after leaving a win over Cleveland because of a right orbital contusion. Marvin Williams scored 14 points, Bismack Biyombo and MIles Bridges each had 13 and Devonte' Graham 11 as Charlotte allowed its highest point total of the season and lost for the fifth time in seven. Charlotte finished with 20 turnovers, one shy of its season-worst mark. The Hornets allowed 39 points off turnovers. ""We couldn't find any traction offensively and then we turned it over,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. Toronto outscored Charlotte 32-18 in the third, when the Raptors made seven of 12 attempts from 3-point range. Anunoby's 16 points in the third was two shy of Charlotte's team total. ""They came out and asserted themselves,"" Williams said of the Raptors. ""They imposed their will on us and we were never able to recover."" TIP-INS Hornets: Williams made all four of his field goal attempts in the second, including three from long range. ... The Hornets are 3-4 on the road. Raptors: F Stanley Johnson (left groin strain stress reaction) was inactive. Toronto recalled F Oshae Brissett from the G-League. . Anunoby's previous career-high was 22 points, set against Washington on Feb. 13, 2019. ... Chris Boucher scored 11 points and had a season-high 11 rebounds. ASSIST HISTORY The Raptors recorded a franchise record 40 assists. Gasol led Toronto with nine and VanVleet had eight.

The Chicago Bulls tried everything against the NBA MVP. Nothing worked. Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 10 rebounds, and the Bucks beat the Bulls 115-101 on Monday night for their fourth straight victory. ""I'm just going to keep trying to go downhill, keep trying to go through guys,"" said Antetokounmpo, brushing off the foul trouble. ""I'm really happy that they're offensive fouls and they're not dumb fouls and all that. ""Usually in the games like this that I get offensive fouls, I know that I'm aggressive. ... So I'm happy with that."" Brook Lopez added 19 points, 10 rebounds and five blocked shots as Milwaukee won for the eighth time in nine games. The Bucks also beat the Bulls 124-115 on Thursday in Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo was 13 for 22 in his 13th consecutive double-double to begin the season. It's the longest active streak in the NBA. ""They have a guy they can go to who can get the bucket,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""That's what good teams have. I've been on those teams. We're figuring out who that guy is."" Daniel Gafford led Chicago with 21 points in his return from the G League. Coby White had 13, and Ryan Arcidiacono finished with 12. The Bulls got a season-high 63 points from their reserves, but Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen struggled. LaVine finished with 11 points on 4-for-16 shooting, and Markkanen had nine on 2-for-12 shooting from the field. ""Shooters, all the players go through slumps,"" said Markkanen, who is shooting just 36.2% this season. ""Everybody's broken through it at some point.

George Hill finished with 18 points for Milwaukee, which improved to 7-2 on the road. Donte DiVincenzo scored 15 in his third consecutive start in place of Khris Middleton, who is out with a bruised left thigh.

Gafford went scoreless in his first four NBA games, but the second-round draft pick had 16 points in the first half on 8-for-9 shooting, including five dunks. Milwaukee closed the second quarter with a 12-2 run for a 60-56 halftime lead. Antetokounmpo had 18 points at the break. TIP-INS Bucks: Hill made four of Milwaukee's 15 3-pointers. ...

"HOUSTON --  James Harden has been scoring at such a prolific rate this season that his 36-point effort in Houstons rout of Portland on Monday night actually caused his average to dip. For him he had a subpar night, Portland coach Terry Stotts said with a slight laugh. Russell Westbrook added 28 points and a triple-double to help the Rockets to their eighth straight win, 132-108. Harden, who has scored at least 30 points in eight straight games, had six rebounds, five assists and a steal. He leads the NBA by averaging a career-high 39.2 points this season. The second-highest scorer in the league is Milwaukees Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is well behind Harden at 30.3 points a game. I think that a lot of people like to normalize greatness when you see it over and over again, Westbrook said. But it's not normal because there's no one else that can do it. If it was normal everybody would do it. He's put himself in a position to one of the best ... scorers of all time. Westbrook had 13 rebounds and 10 assists for his third triple-double of the season and the 141st of his career after sitting out to rest in Houston's last game on Saturday night. Coach Mike DAntoni loved the way Harden and Westbrook worked together on Monday night. You've got a dose of (Westbrooks) athleticism coming at you and they've got to get back and get a wall and then ... it didn't quite go and get it back to James and just let him do what James does, DAntoni said. It's a pretty good 1-2 punch, that's for sure. The Rockets led by double digits for most of this one on a night they got starters Clint Capela and Danuel House back after both players had missed time with injuries. Houston was up by 18 with about five minutes left when Harden made a 3-pointer to make it 120-99. Westbrook collected his 10th assist when Harden made a layup with about 3 1/2 minutes left for Houston's next points and the pair along with P.J. Tucker headed to the bench for good after that. CJ McCollum led the Trail Blazers with 25 points in a game where Damian Lillard shot just 4 of 15 and had 13 points. Stotts was unhappy that his team had more rebounds overall than Houston but had just 12 offensive rebounds to 17 by the Rockets. The thing that was probably the most disappointing was their offensive rebounding and how they converted their offensive rebounding into points, he said. I thought that was the difference in the first half. Houston led by 23 points entering the fourth quarter after scoring 35 points in a big third quarter. The Trail Blazers cut it to 102-85 with about 9 minutes to go but Westbrook had the next three points to pad the lead. The Trail Blazers cut the lead to 11 with a 3-pointer by McCollum with about 8 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. The Rockets then used a 19-6 run to make it 94-70 with about 2 1/2 minutes left in the period. Harden had six points in that stretch and Tucker made a 3-pointer and added five points. The Rockets were up by 14 at halftime after a 15-point second quarter from Harden. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Stotts said Carmelo Anthony is expected to join the team on Tuesday. Anthony hasn't played in the NBA since Nov. 8, 2018, when he was with the Rockets ... Portland made 11 of 36 3-pointers. Rockets: G Eric Gordon spoke to reporters on Monday for the first time since having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last week.

Hayes sat courtside with fellow Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon to witness Capelas big game. I talked to him a little bit after the game and he congratulated me, Capela said.

Doncic is the second-youngest player in NBA history to have a 40-point triple-double, after James. They are the only two players to record 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21. ""It feels like every day there are stats you don't know about, stats that you read about,"" Doncic said. ""It's great to hit."" Dallas led wire to wire but had to fend off a late Spurs rally, with Doncic hitting a 3-pointer with 26.5 seconds to play that put Dallas up 115-110 after the Spurs rallied from 14 down at the start of the quarter. Doncic has an NBA-leading six triple-doubles in 13 games this season. ""This guy can do anything he wants to on a basketball court,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He's having one of those magical runs right now. It's a phenomenal thing to watch. It's a phenomenal thing to be a part of."" Dallas got a career-high 22 points from Dorian Finney-Smith, and Kristaps Porzingis added 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Spurs have lost six in a row, their longest slide since 2011, and dropped eight of nine since a 4-1 start. They're off to their worst start since 1996-97, the season before they drafted former star and current assistant coach Tim Duncan. DeMar DeRozan scored a season-high 36 points for the Spurs, helping to lead a fourth-quarter surge after they trailed 93-79 entering the period. ""When adversity hits, you can't run from it, you can't shy away from it, you can't let it get you down,"" DeRozan said. ""Try to channel that energy and put it in the right place so we can understand why we got beat."" KEY SEQUENCE With Dallas up 110-107, both Bryn Forbes and Patty Mills missed potential game-tying 3s. On the ensuing possession, Porzingis lost the ball going up to shoot, but Finney-Smith scooped it up and fired an off-balance 20-footer as the shot clock expired. It fell through to put Dallas up five. ""I looked at the clock, and [the ball] just bounced right to me, and I threw it up,"" Finney-Smith said. ""Exactly like we drew it up."" After Rudy Gay's 3 brought the Spurs back within two, Doncic stepped back and hit the 3 that finally finished off San Antonio. FINNEY-SMITH EMERGES Finney-Smith shot 8-for-10 from the field and made three 3s. All the more impressive was that the fourth-year wing, who has built a reputation with his defense, had his career game while drawing a tough assignment in DeRozan. ""I think I owe [Carlisle] some money because I said I wouldn't go for [DeRozan's] pump fake, and he got me one time,"" Finney-Smith said. TIP-INS Spurs: Coach Gregg Popovich talked about Duncan, in his first season as an assistant coach: ""His mere presence is valuable. When a young kid has Tim Duncan put his arm around them and guide them in a certain way, give them a piece of advice, that's way more important than what I can do."" Mavericks: This was their first matchup with the Spurs since the retirement of Dirk Nowitzki, who played against San Antonio 78 times in the regular season -- more than he faced any other team. Nowitzki faced San Antonio 36 more times in the playoffs in six series between 2001 and 2014.","401160836"
"PHOENIX --  Bostons Kemba Walker took his time during the final seconds of the first half before accelerating around one defender and splitting two more while scooping a layup off the glass for the buzzer-beating basket. One night after their 10-game winning streak was snapped, the Celtics were right back to their dominating basketball. Jayson Tatum scored 26 points, Walker added 19 and Boston won for the 11th time in 12 games by beating the Phoenix Suns 99-85 on Monday night. We showed a lot of heart, a lot of fight, Tatum said. We could have held our heads down after yesterday. The streak ended and we lost a close game. But thats the good thing about the NBA, no matter how good or bad you play, theres another game coming up real soon. Thats what matters. Boston (11-2) had its lengthy win streak snapped Sunday by the Sacramento Kings but bounced back with a relatively easy road victory. The Celtics led by 15 at halftime thanks to a 20-4 run at the end of the second quarter and never had their lead cut to less than nine in the second half. You know youre not going to win every game but when you have opportunities to bounce back and learn from mistakes and then you actually come out and do it, it just feels good, Walker said. Tatum shot 8 of 16 from the field and added 11 rebounds. Marcus Smart scored 17 points but left early in the fourth quarter because of a sprained right ankle. Smart said he might have tried to return if the game had been close and that there wasnt much swelling after the injury. It just irritated the exact same ankle I was coming back from in the same spot, Smart said. But everythings fine. I should be fine to play the rest of the trip. Phoenix (7-5) was playing without starting point guard Ricky Rubio, who was out because of back spasms. The offense never looked comfortable without him, relying on individual plays instead of their usual crisp ball movement. Suns coach Monty Williams said Rubios absence hurt, but it didnt explain all the offensive issues. We havent had 20-point quarters all year, we had two tonight. Its a great learning experience for us, Williams said. We have an identity and one of those components is sharing the ball. When we move the ball and have player movement, were pretty good. Devin Booker led the Suns with 20 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 15. Phoenix shot just 40% from the field, including 28% from 3-point range, and had its lowest-scoring game of the season. Phoenix had a 38-37 lead midway through the second quarter but scored just four points over the final six minutes of the half. Credit to (Boston), theyre playing well, but Im not sure if it was them or if it was just us, Suns center Aron Baynes said. We just have to be better at sticking to what we do. We didnt look like ourselves tonight. WILLIAMS ADDS BIG MINUTES Boston reserve Grant Williams had a big impact on the game with two blocked shots during the teams 20-4 run to end the first half. He finished with four points and two rebounds in 18 minutes, one night after not playing against Sacramento. Grants two blocks were huge because we were dead on those plays and he covered for us, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston missed nine of its first 10 shots but rallied for a 26-22 lead after one quarter. ... Brad Wanamaker scored 10 points off the bench. ... Daniel Theis had no points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes. Suns: Rubios issues with back spasms were announced less than an hour before the game. Jevon Carter started in his place and finished with three points and two assists in 25 minutes. ... Booker came into the game averaging 31 points against Boston over seven career games, which was his highest against any opponent.","401160837"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Early in the second half, Karl-Anthony Towns went to the hoop and was rejected by Rudy Gobert. After that, Towns didn't even try to shoot inside the 3-point arc. Worked out pretty well. Towns tied a career high with seven 3s and scored 29 points to help the Minnesota Timberwolves hand the Utah Jazz their first home loss of the season, 112-102 on Monday night. Running repeated pick-and-pops near the top of the key and drawing Gobert, the two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, away from the basket paid dividends as the Timberwolves went on an 18-2 run in a stunning fourth quarter. ""I was feeling real good. I was feeling juiced,"" said Towns, who said his teammates were encouraging him to keep shooting. ""Don't worry about me,"" he said back to the bench. ""I'm going to keep throwing them up and they're going to go in."" Towns matched a franchise record with his 15 attempts from 3-point range. Without second-leading scorer Andrew Wiggins, the Timberwolves held the Jazz to season-low 36.8% shooting and were bolstered by Jeff Teague's 21 points and 11 assists. Rookie forward Kelan Martin had seven of his 14 points during Minnesota's decisive run in the fourth, and Robert Covington added 15 points. ""I was just being confident. I saw lanes and was shooting my floaters . and that opened my game up,"" Martin said. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 18 points before fouling out and Donovan Mitchell had 17 points on 5-of-24 shooting for Utah. The Jazz led 88-85 before the Timberwolves began a game-changing shooting streak. Towns hit three consecutive 3s in the fourth, the final jumper from 29 feet with 4:45 to play. He stood and admired the shot long after it went in as Utah called a timeout. ""It looked real nice,"" he said. ""Karl is a talent that can play inside and out and Rudy Gobert is an incredible defensive catalyst,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""So you want to do your best to keep him away from the basket as much as possible."" Teague hit two free throws in the midst of Towns' 3-point display and added a driving layup and two more foul shots a short time later. The point guard then found Martin for a 3 and the largest lead of the night for either team at 103-90. ""Teague was able to drive the ball. Their whole group was able to get where they wanted more than we would like,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""When Towns is spaced like that it puts even more pressure on your individual defenders."" Gobert had 16 points and 14 rebounds for the Jazz, who fell to 6-1 at home. The Jazz went cold when they usually heat up, in the fourth quarter of home games. ""We started to do it individually instead of moving the ball. I took some terrible shots,"" Mitchell said. Wiggins missed his third straight game -- the first two for personal reasons and this one due to illness. He was playing the best basketball of his career and had scored at least 25 points in six straight games. The Timberwolves lost their other two without the high-scoring wing. SUMMER WORK PAYS OFF Martin was playing in the G-League just last week but found himself on the floor and contributing down the stretch. Teague wasn't surprised and had been waiting for this moment. ""I worked with him all summer at my gym in Indiana. I know what he's capable of doing. He's a confident player and once he saw one go down, he can get hot and he can score in bunches, so I was happy for him,"" Teague said. Towns said the best encouragement for the rookie was giving him the ball in pressure situations and trusting him. ""He's a bona fide scorer and the most fundamental shooter on our team, and I know he can get hot. He's a microwave,"" Towns said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns got his fourth foul with 5:03 left in the third quarter by kicking Gobert during a 3-point attempt. ... Shabazz Napier was out with a sore hamstring. ... Minnesota has matched the 2015-16 season for the best road start in franchise history at 5-2. Jazz: Utah looked disjointed in Jeff Green's first extended run at center in Utah during the first half, and the Jazz were outscored by nine during the experiment. ... Dante Exum played his first game of the season after knee surgery in March and scored two points in 14 minutes. ... Emmanuel Mudiay drew a standing ovation with a fake behind-the-back-dribble drive that fooled his defender for a layup late in the third quarter.","401160838"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers offense wasnt doing much through three quarters, so they buckled down on defense and narrowly avoided getting beat by a couple of former teammates. Paul George hit a go-ahead 3-pointer against his old team with 25 seconds left, lifting Los Angeles over the Oklahoma City Thunder 90-88 on Monday night to improve to 8-1 at home. Its any other game but it was fun to see familiar faces and share some laughs, George said. With the Clippers minus Kawhi Leonard for the third straight game because of a bruised left knee, Oklahoma City tied the score at 86 on a 3 by ex-Clipper Danilo Gallinari. Chris Paul made two free throws after being fouled by George for an 88-86 lead, but Georges 3 put Los Angeles back ahead 89-88. Maurice Harkless was then called for a foul on Gallinari that was overturned following a replay challenge by Clippers coach Doc Rivers. Im changing my opinion. I think the challenge is good for the game, joked Rivers, who had been critical of the new rule. The Thunder retained possession and Terrance Ferguson inbounded to Gallinari, whose open 3-pointer missed. The last shot Gallo took, I cringed. Ive seen that movie before, said Lou Williams, who had 11 points and nine assists. Wide open at the top of the key, thats his shot. Luckily for us it rimmed out. George hit a free throw with 0.3 seconds left to close it out against the team that traded him to Los Angeles last summer. The difference in the game was me not fighting through that screen at the end that allowed Paul George to get that final shot, said Paul, who had forced a turnover by George on the previous play. The Thunder fell to 0-5 on the road. Montrezl Harrell had 28 points and 12 rebounds off the bench to lead the Clippers. George finished with 18 points after scoring 30-plus in his first two games of the season after rehabbing from two shoulder operations. Offense was spotty all night but we did a great job of making enough winning plays, Harrell said. That is just what it comes down to, putting enough stops together and making sure that the defense does not take a lapse even when your offense isnt going for you. Paul scored 22 points, making 10 of 11 free throws, in 29 minutes. Gallinari added 14 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, another former Clipper, had 11 points despite five fouls. Gilgeous-Alexander also took a late 3 that missed. Neither team led by more than six points all night. Harrell scored on back-to-back dunks, with Georges alley-oop pass setting up the first one, and he scored another basket before George followed with a 3-pointer to put the Clippers ahead 75-70. The Thunder led 79-78 on a basket by Dennis Schroder before Harrell dominated the final 2:44. Harrell scored eight straight points to give Los Angeles an 86-83 lead. The Thunder led 59-54 on Pauls 3-pointer in the third. The Clippers revived themselves with a 12-5 run, getting back-to-back 3-pointers from Patrick Patterson and JaMychal Green, to head into the fourth leading 66-64. George was limited to a single 3 in the quarter. TIP-INS Thunder: Gallinari and Gilgeous-Alexander were honored with a video tribute from the Clippers during a timeout in the first quarter. The people were very good to me and I was very happy to see the video, Gallinari said. Gilgeous-Alexander missed the video because he was talking to his coach. Ill have to go and see it later, he said. ... Hamidou Diallo (left knee sprain) sat out his second straight game. Clippers: Landry Shamet (high ankle sprain) missed his fourth game in a row. ... Assistant coach Sam Cassell turned 50. TURNING IT OVER George had seven turnovers as he continues to adjust to his new teammates. When you miss a lot of games youre usually sloppy with the ball, Rivers said. All of those things will get better for him as the season goes on. COMING HOME Paul hasnt left Los Angeles completely. His family continues to live here, including his wife and kids who have remained in local schools. His father and brother attended the game, too. I love coming back here, he said.","401160839"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  With Alec Burks leading the offense, the Golden State Warriors finally put together a team effort to end their seven-game slide. Burks scored a season-high 29 points, Glenn Robinson III added 20 and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-95 on Tuesday night. ""We've been competing, and I think this is probably one of the first games in a little while that we've put a full game together,"" said Marquese Chriss, later adding: ""I'm just happy we won to be honest. I could have not scored, and we had won, I'd have been all right. I think tonight was just fun for everybody."" Chriss and Eric Paschall each had 17 points for the Warriors. Draymond Green was just short of his 24th career triple-double with eight points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Rookie Ja Morant scored 20 points for Memphis, while Dillon Brooks finished with 18. Brandon Clarke added 17 and Jae Crowder had 15 points along with 11 rebounds as Memphis lost its second straight. Even undermanned, the Warriors were able to cause enough problems for Memphis that the game was pretty much over before halftime. The Warriors built their 61-46 halftime lead behind Memphis' poor shooting and poor defense. Much like its blowout loss to Denver on Sunday, Memphis' problems were evident in the second quarter when Golden State outscored the Grizzlies 26-4 to open the frame. ""We started putting stops together,"" Green said. ""Once we started putting stops together, we were able to get out and get some buckets in transition. Get the game in our pace. When you are putting three, four stops in a row together, you are able to open the lead up."" Memphis got the deficit to single digits late in the third quarter for the only time in the second half, but Golden State never let the Grizzlies threaten in the fourth. The second-quarter onslaught left Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins talking in the same terms as he did in Sunday's 131-114 loss to Denver: opponents hungry for a win, setting the tone early, then taking the game to another level, a level Memphis couldn't match. ""We started missing shots, and they were getting out and running on us,"" Jenkins said. ""But I felt like they played at a different level than us."" For the Warriors, that ""level"" represented the first win since Nov. 14 against Portland. ""Losing sucks,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said candidly. ""When you lose seven in a row, it's miserable. .Tonight, our players were rewarded, and now, hopefully, we can kind of use this as some momentum and get some more wins."" TIP-INS Warriors: With his second block of the game, Green passed Andris Biedrins (580) for fifth on the Warriors' career blocks list. . Robinson is the only Golden State player to start all 15 games this season. . Continued to have seven players listed as ""out"" because of injuries, including Stephen Curry (left hand fracture), D'Angelo Russell (right hand sprain) and Klay Thompson (left ACL rehab). Grizzlies: Reserve G Grayson Allen missed his ninth game with left ankle soreness. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins indicated Allen is close to returning, and the team may have a better feel by the end of the weekend. . Jaren Jackson Jr., who entered the game averaging 18.8 points in his last five games, was held to eight. . Clarke, who hit all eight of his shots Sunday against Denver, was 6 of 14 Tuesday night. . Made nine 3-pointers, ending a streak of seven straight games with at least 10 3-pointers. A WARRIOR SCARE With seven players sitting out, the Warriors bench took a collective gasp in the third quarter when Green went down under the Grizzlies basket holding his elbow. He came to the bench, but eventually returned in the fourth quarter. ""It's a little sore, but it's all right,"" Green said after the game. ""It just felt like a bruising pain, so I knew I would play through it."" Chriss was a little more worried at the time of the injury. ""I can't curse because I don't want to get in trouble, but I was mad,"" said Chriss. ""It seems like that's the type of things that are happening right now."" REHAB UPDATE The Warriors announced Tuesday that Kevon Looney, who has missed the last 13 games (Neuropathy) and Alen Smailagic, out since the preseason with a sprained right ankle, have been cleared to begin accelerated on-court basketball activities and will work out with G League Santa Cruz.","401160840"
"Carmelo Anthony says it was a great feeling getting back out on the court and describes the hectic hours leading up to his debut. (1:00) NEW ORLEANS --  Carmelo Anthony smiled easily in a hallway outside the Trail Blazers locker room and asserted that he felt great after the first game of his 17th NBA season, even if his new team couldnt keep pace with Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram and a largely revamped Pelicans squad that is showing signs of figuring some things out. It felt great just to be back into the flow of the game, be back on the court, be back to where I think I belong, Anthony said. As far as conditioning, though, I felt absolutely great out there. There was minor things, but it was more of the flow of things, and getting used to how the team plays and sets and getting used to the guys on the team. Holiday had 22 points and 10 assists, Ingram added 21 points in his return from a four-game absence, and New Orleans beat Portland 115-104 on Tuesday night for its second straight victory and third in four games. Anthony finished with 10 points while Portland leading scorer and four-time All-Star Damian Lillard missed his first game of the season with back spasms. Starting at forward and playing across the street from where he led Syracuse to the 2003 NCAA championship over Kansas, Anthony scored the Blazers first points of the game on a 3-pointer from 26 feet out. Anthony missed 10 of 14 shots, but also hadnt even participated in a full practice, having joined the team the day after its loss in Houston on Monday night. For having (only) a morning shootaround, I thought he was pretty good, Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. I thought every shot he had, he was getting a good look at the basket. Ingram looked spry in his return from right knee soreness, particularly on an authoritative, driving, one-handed dunk that got the crowd roaring in the opening quarter. I think trying to get to my spots and assert myself a little bit and getting other players involved, I think I did an OK job, Ingram said. I felt pretty good today. I didnt have any restrictions. C.J. McCollum led Portland with 22 points, while Hassan Whiteside added 14 points and 14 rebounds. J.J. Redick hit 4 of 9 3-pointers and scored 14 points for New Orleans. Kenrich Williams, starting at forward, filled the stat sheet with hustle plays, grabbing 14 rebounds to go with three steals, three drawn charging fouls and a blocked shot. He also scored eight points. He just makes winning plays, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Thats what he does -- winning play after winning play. New Orleans seized momentum in the third quarter, going up by 13 on a sequence that began when Nicolo Melli hit a 3 and then got the ball right back in a largely vacated Portland back court after Nickeil Alexander-Walker dove to swipe the ball away from McCollum. Melli went straight in for a dunk that made it 83-70. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Nassir Little had 12 points and 11 rebounds. ... Kent Bazemore scored 11 points. ... Shot 16 of 29 (55.2 percent) from 3-point range, but only 40 of 92 (43.5 percent) overall and missed five of 13 free throws. Pelicans: Melli finished with 14 points and ETwaun Moore added 11 points off the bench. ... Guard Frank Jackson returned after missing one game with a neck bruise and scored nine points. ... Guard Lonzo Ball (groin), center Derrick Favors (back) and guard Josh Hart (ankle) were among the injured for New Orleans. HOLIDAY HIGHLIGHTS Holiday highlighted his night with a spinning dribble around Little for a driving dunk. Im not really trying to dunk. That takes a lot of energy out of you, Holiday said, adding that it was really the way Little pursued him that spurred him to finish strong. I just felt him coming and at that point I wasnt trying to get my shot blocked. In the second half, Holiday scored on an unusual play in which he remained under his own basket, re-tying his shoes while his team advanced 4-on-5 into the offensive end. Holiday then came sprinting down court, took a handoff from Melli near the 3-point line and exploded toward the rim for a layup. ASSERTIVE ANTHONY Anthony wasted no time getting his first shot off. His miss from 20 feet came within the opening 30 seconds and was Portlands first shot of the game. Anthony also took Portlands second shot, hitting his first of two made 3s. But when Anthony tried to rise for a two-handed dunk in the first half, he was met with resistance by a member of the NBAs rookie class when eighth overall draft pick Jaxson Hayes rejected the attempt in what was his second of three blocks. I thought he was going to try to lay it up, Hayes said. It just shows his passion for the game still. Hes still trying to go dunk on people. ... Blocking it was pretty fun.","401160841"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  For the second time in two games against Phoenix this season, the Sacramento Kings allowed the Suns to have a 70-point second half. At least this time Luke Walton's team was able to overcome it. Barely. Bogdan Bogdanovic set career highs with 31 points and seven 3-pointers, and Sacramento beat the Suns 120-116 on Tuesday night. ""I know it didn't feel great the way we played in the second half but our guys stuck together and scrapped it out,"" Walton said. ""Even though it wasn't pretty ... we gutted out a win. We'll take that and hopefully learning a lesson while doing it."" The Kings were terrible against the Suns in Phoenix during a season-opening 124-95 loss on Oct. 23. Sacramento committed 27 turnovers and was outscored 70-36 in the second half of that game. This time, the Kings had 18 turnovers while Phoenix held a 71-58 scoring advantage after halftime. ""We have to finish it better and keep that lead until the end,"" Bogdanovic said. ""They changed their lineup and everyone started rolling and we kind of let them do whatever. We kind of were, `OK, we got it.' It's the NBA. You have to be ready to lock in and finish the game."" Richaun Holmes had 20 points and 15 rebounds, Nemanja Bjelica scored 17 points and Harrison Barnes added 15 for Sacramento. The Kings have won four of five.

""I loved the battle of our team and the way we came out at halftime,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""We changed up our defenses a little bit but they hit tough shots after tough shots. But I just loved the fight of our team. We stayed together."" Bogdanovic shot 11 of 14 overall and was 7 of 9 beyond the arc. He made four 3s and had 14 of Sacramento's 16 points during one stretch in the second quarter, then made three more from the perimeter in the fourth to help the Kings hold on. But Bogdanovic spent the final few moments of the game on the bench with tightness in his left hamstring. ""I think it's cramped,"" Bogdanovic said. ""I kind of felt it the whole second half but at the end it was a little bit harder and I had to go out. But it was OK."" Phoenix trailed by 26 early in the third quarter. The Suns were within 90-81 early in the fourth but couldn't stop Bogdanovic. The 27-year-old Serbian scored 11 points in the final 12 minutes, including his seventh 3-pointer that made it 106-91. Phoenix made a final push to get within 116-113 with 14 seconds left before Yogi Ferrell and Holmes made two free throws apiece for Sacramento. ""It felt like after playing so unselfish in the first half, 17 assists, ball flying around side to side, it felt like to me that we started trying to stat-hunt a little bit,"" Walton said. ""When we continued to run our plays we got wide open everything. When we got stagnant their zone stopped us."" The Suns were sluggish offensively early in their first road game since Nov. 2. Phoenix shot 26% in the first quarter and was marginally better in the second quarter. Ricky Rubio had one point and two assists in 16 minutes. Rubio did not play in Monday's loss to Boston because of back spasms. ""The cause of desperation and energy and sense of urgency is what we needed to start the third quarter with,"" Booker said. ""When you're down by 26 points it's a tough spot to be in.""

"LOS ANGELES --  To LeBron James, triple-doubles are not a goal. They are only a side effect of the consistent, brilliant all-around play he has been dishing out for 17 NBA seasons, with no slowdown in sight. Triple-doubles also don't mean much to LeBron without wins attached to them, so James was pleased when his latest statistical superlative occurred during yet another successful night for the surging Los Angeles Lakers. James became the first player in NBA history to record a triple-double against every team in the league, and Anthony Davis scored 34 points during the Lakers' fifth straight victory, 112-107 over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night. James finished with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to post a triple-double against his 30th opponent for the NBA-leading Lakers, who have won 12 of 13 after a perfect four-game homestand. James was more surprised than thrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different statistic glared at him from the box score. ""Coach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, 'Congratulations,' and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,"" James said. ""I really don't know what to think about it. I just think it's a pretty cool stat to know, and I'm glad it happened in a win."" James has five triple-doubles in the Lakers' last 10 games, getting four in victories. There's a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly filled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the NBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career average. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest streak of his career. Vogel has put the ball in James' hands constantly on offense, and his playmaking acumen has grown along with his chemistry with Davis, as they demonstrated repeatedly against the Thunder. Seven of LeBron's assists came on baskets by Davis. ""Amazing,"" Davis said. ""To be able to do that against every team is something special. I mean, (it's) trippy that he's been playing for a long time, so it was a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard work."" James is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him -- Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd -- hadn't done it against 30 teams. Kidd, who did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James' efforts as a tall point guard. ""He's just playing terrific basketball,"" Vogel said. ""For him to be doing what he's doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There's no reason to believe he can't sustain that for the rest of the season and help us make a real strong playoff push."" Dennis Schroder scored 20 of his season-high 31 points in a phenomenal first half for the Thunder, who have lost four of five despite two solid performances at Staples Center. Danilo Gallinari added 25 points in his former home arena, and Nerlens Noel had 15. ""That's why (James) is considered probably the best of all time, but I think we did a great job on him,"" Schroder said. ""They obviously hit some tough shots."" One night after the Thunder barely missed an upset win over the Clippers thanks to a last-minute 3-pointer by former star Paul George, Oklahoma City couldn't quite catch up to the powerful Lakers despite keeping the game close all night. ""There's a lot of things we did well in there,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""But, you know, we came up short in all these games. I think the one sign you can point to is both teams, the Clippers and the Lakers, are really, really good teams, so we're competing well at a high level. But we've just got to do more in order to be able to finish and close out games."" The Thunder won't have to wait long for a rematch: These teams meet again in Oklahoma City in three days. TIP-INS Thunder: F Hamidou Diallo missed his third straight game with a left knee sprain. ... Schroder got a technical foul in the third quarter for confronting Davis at the free throw line after Davis dunked and was fouled. Lakers: Kyle Kuzma left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion after teenager Darius Bazley hit him in the right side of his face with an elbow on a drive. Kuzma returned to the bench in the second half, but with obvious damage above his eye. He didn't return to the game, although Vogel said he was available if necessary. The Lakers plan to re-evaluate him within the next 24 hours. CLOSEOUT SEQUENCE James' 3-pointer put the Lakers up 109-98 with 3:08 to play, but the Thunder scored nine straight points to cut the Lakers' lead to two on Gallinari's free throws with 1:24 left. After Danny Green got a key offensive rebound for the Lakers, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drilled a 3-pointer with 55 seconds left. James missed two free throws moments later to keep the Thunder in it, but Oklahoma City couldn't score again. POINT GUARDS BEHAVE Chris Paul had four points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Thunder, and he didn't appear to clash with Rajon Rondo, his opponent in a fight early last season while he was with the Rockets. Rondo had eight points and a season-high 10 assists.","401160843"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Ben Simmons wore a ""Sesame Street"" sweatshirt in the locker room, the classic characters lined up on the familiar street. The theme seemed appropriate for 76ers fans, because it was finally time to count Simmons' 3-pointers. One! One 3-pointer for Ben Simmons! ""Hold me back, fam!"" 76ers announcer Marc Zumoff exclaimed on the TV call. The anticipated shot didn't win a playoff or even big regular-season game. Simmons, though, got the weight of the ridicule for the career 0-fer off his back when he hit the first 3-pointer of his career and had 18 points and 13 assists to lead Philadelphia to a 109-104 victory over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. Mike Scott's fourth 3-pointer of the game with 1:29 left stretched the Sixers' lead to 99-95 and they held on after New York's Marcus Morris hit a pair of 3s in the final 10 seconds. Joel Embiid had 23 points and 13 rebounds, and Scott scored 12 points. The only shot that mattered in Philly was the 3 from Simmons, finally, in his 172nd career game and after nearly $19 million in salary. Simmons acted like it was no big deal. ""It feels good, yeah. You put in work in the summer and it pays off,"" Simmons said. Simmons did the improbable when he fired a 24-footer from the corner in front of the 76ers bench and the shot was good, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Simmons received a lengthy standing ovation for the first 3-pointer after 17 misses (and one more miss in the postseason) to start his NBA career. The 23-year-old Simmons is an All-Star and franchise cornerstone for the Eastern Conference contenders, a triple-double threat each time out. But never a long ball threat, a fact that earned him derision around the league. He's been criticized for his lack of outside shooting, defiant at times about his weakness and spent the offseason working hard on improving his jumper. Simmons said at the start of training camp, if he's open for a 3-point shot, ""I'll take it."" ""Other people get more excited than I do,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""But how can it not be a good thing? But if we're all honest, that's the first legitimate 3 that he's taken."" Simmons sank a 3 against the Guangzhou Loong-Lions of China in the preseason that had Sixers fans treating the shot like he hit a winner in an NBA postseason game. Against the Knicks, Simmons took a bounce pass from Furkan Korkmaz and calmly drained the shot with 8:20 left in the first quarter. ""There's Simmons. Yes! He did it,"" Zumoff said. ""Maybe now they'll finally leave him alone after that! He hits the 3! The first of his NBA career!"" He did it in front of everyone from fans that paid $8 on the secondary market for an upper deck ticket to Hall of Famer Julius Erving. Simmons' older sister and , Liv, clapped back at critics, tweeting, ""Now you can all shut the hell up...."" Maybe Dr. J can deliver that basketball straight to Springfield, Massachusetts. Simmons hit one 3; the four-win Knicks hit 11, and used a fantastic third quarter to take a 17-point lead. Morris led the Knicks with 22 points. Simmons even played peacemaker in a scrap between his teammate Embiid and Morris, a Jayhawk-on-Jayhawk altercation that had Kansas fans everywhere waving the white flag instead of the wheat. Morris dragged Embiid to the court late in the second quarter, and the Sixers All-Star center popped up in anger. Simmons pulled away his teammate to avoid a repeat of Embiid's brawl last month with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns that earned him a two-game suspension. Embiid and Morris jawed at each other and each was hit with a technical foul. Morris also earned a flagrant. ""I just got thrown on the ground and I really don't know why I got a technical foul,"" Embiid said. ""I'm being the victim and didn't do anything. I feel like it's starting to get ridiculous with the flagrants."" It's not the first confrontation between the two: Morris played for Boston when he was trash-talked by the theatrical Embiid. Morris held up three fingers to show Boston was up 3-0 in a 2018 playoff series. ""He started it last year in the playoffs and he keeps going,"" Embiid said. They went back-and-forth in the fourth in Philly. Embiid thundered a two-handed jam off a turnover to tie the game at 82-all and put some life back in the Sixers only for Morris to hit a jumper for an 85-83 lead. ""He be flopping. He was flopping and grabbing,"" Morris said. ""I'm not the one that's gonna take that. He knows that."" HE SAID IT ""Big dog, I'm 240,"" Morris, on if he was surprised how easily Embiid crashed to the ground. BOOMER, BABY Simmons, a native Australian, said he was excited Brown seems set to return to coach the Australian national team in the Olympics. ""I'm looking forward to it. He's coaching me now, so we have a great relationship,"" Simmons said. TIP-INS Knicks: Lost to the 76ers for the ninth straight time. ... Julius Randle and Frank Ntilikina each scored 17 points. ... Morris led with four 3s. 76ers: G Josh Richardson sat out with hip injury and was replaced in the starting lineup by Korkmaz. ... Hit 13 3s.","401160844"
"WASHINGTON --  Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, their longest skid since he took over as the teams coach more than 20 years ago. With little resistance at the defensive end from San Antonio on Wednesday night, Washingtons Bradley Beal shot 9 for 9 in a 21-point third quarter en route to scoring 33 in all, and the lowly Wizards beat the Spurs 138-132. All in all, if you score 132 points, you should probably have a pretty good chance to win a game. The bad news is, if you give up 138, you are not going to win, Popovich said during a brief-as-can-be postgame session. Im a really smart guy. Im figuring thats logical. I could be wrong. ... Theres not much else to say. It is the Spurs worst stretch since they had a pair of droughts that lasted seven and eight games in 1996-97, when David Robinson got injured and Popovich moved from the front office to the sideline about a quarter of the way through the season. In the ensuing draft, the Spurs took Tim Duncan, who starred for the team and now is an assistant to Popovich. San Antonio has made the playoffs in each of the past 22 seasons, claiming five NBA championships in that time. Put simply, the Spurs are not used to this sort of lose night-after-night thing. The streak that were on, every single game weve lost feels worse than the last game, said DeMar DeRozan, who led San Antonio with 31 points but missed a pair of free throws with 9.9 seconds left and Washington up 136-132. The Spurs fell to 5-10, despite being ahead 69-63 at halftime and having eight players score in double figures. That included Patty Mills, who made his first start of the season and began the night 6 for 6 from the field but missed his next four shots and finished with 16 points. Weve just got to stay positive. Weve got to stick together, Mills said. Weve got to find a way and well get through it. Davis Bertans, acquired by Washington from San Antonio in the offseason, and Ish Smith each scored 21 for the Wizards, who came into the day with a 3-8 record, the worst mark in the Eastern Conference. San Antonio led by 10 before Beal scored nine points in a 22-3 spurt over about 5 minutes in the third quarter that put the Wizards out front 94-85. It was quite a turnaround for Beal, who went just 3 for 9 in the first half. Brad took over, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said, and hes hard to stop. TIP-INS Spurs: Bryn Forbes scored 19. ... Derrick White missed a game for the first time this season; he had a sore left foot. Wizards: This was the 10th consecutive time -- and 11th in 12 games this season -- that the Wizards gave up at least 60 points in the first half. POP ON FEMALE COACHES Before a game between two teams that have a female assistant (San Antonios Becky Hammon and Washingtons Kristi Tolliver), Popovich was asked about the possibility of a female head coach in the NBA. His answer: Theres no difference between a woman who knows the game and a man who knows the game. It's just another prejudice that probably has to be overcome -- just like a lot of other prejudices in the world have become less and less as people pay attention to them. Its a process. It doesnt happen quickly. But I think the more women there are, obviously, it becomes more commonplace and the rule, and it will depend on an organization realizing that there are women that can do this. Every woman can't; every man can't. The point is that theres got to be enough to choose from.","401160845"
"ATLANTA --  Giannis Antetokounmpo wasnt concerned that the Milwaukee Bucks let the Atlanta Hawks back in the game late in the fourth quarter. What mattered to Antetokounmpo was another road win for his streaking team. If you want to be a really good team in this league, youve got to win on the road, he said. It doesnt matter where we play, as long as we come out there and give ourselves a chance to win every night. Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 11 rebounds, Eric Bledsoe scored 28 and the Bucks won their fifth consecutive game with a 135-127 victory over the Hawks on Wednesday night. It marked the league-high ninth time this season that Antetokounmpo, the reigning NBA MVP, has had at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. The Bucks, with the leagues second-ranked offense, have won nine of 10 and improved to an NBA-best 8-2 on the road despite a sloppy ending as Atlanta cut the lead to single digits in the final minute. Rookie forward DeAndre Hunter finished with a career-high 27 points and Trae Young scored 25 for the Hawks, who have lost four straight and seven of eight. Atlanta was coming off a 1-4 road trip that included a 49-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. When we play at other teams paces, its tough for us, Young said. Weve got to be better at dictating the speed of the game instead of letting them dictate it. This game was close in the first half, but Milwaukee led by 18 on Pat Connaughtons 3-pointer with 9:53 remaining. The Hawks whittled a 19-point deficit to seven late in the fourth quarter, causing Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer to put Antetokounmpo back in the game before Sterling Brown hit a corner 3 to make it 129-119 with 1:48 left. They threw a different type of defense out, press and play hard, Bledsoe said. But I thought we did a great job of sustaining. Antetokounmpo took a fast-break pass down the right side for a big dunk on the baseline to make it 42-35 in the second quarter and scored on consecutive possessions to put the Bucks up 73-63 in the third, finishing off a 15-2 run with a fast-break dunk. After the Hawks trimmed the lead to five a few minutes later, Antetokounmpo hit a 3 to cap a 17-point performance in the third. Connaughtons short runner built the lead to 96-83 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Bucks: G Donte DiVincenzo, making his fourth straight start, had 11 points. Its been a good run for DiVincenzo, who scored 15 points against Chicago and 14 against Indiana as a starting replacement for Khris Middleton (bruised left thigh). Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce said G Kevin Huerter has better range of motion in his shoulder but is still expected to miss at least another week with a left rotator cuff strain. SPECIAL OUTFITS The Hawks went with a new look to celebrate their 50th season in the Peach State, decking out the floor with a black team logo trimmed in peach and a peach logo on the baselines. The team wore black uniforms that read Peachtree in white and peach trim across the jerseys. State Farm Arena is about five blocks west of the citys renowned Peachtree Street. LOPEZ IN THE PAINT Bucks center Brook Lopez finished with two blocks. He had five blocks in his past two games and ranks third in the league, but Budenholzer thinks Lopez doesnt get enough credit. Its amazing when hes able to contest a shot, make them miss and get the rebound, Budenholzer said. Its sometimes underrated what he does.","401160846"
"NEW YORK --  Without Kyrie Irving for the third straight game due to an injured right shoulder, the Brooklyn Nets used a trio of players to pick up the slack. Jarrett Allen led the way with 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds, and the Nets beat the Charlotte Hornets 101-91 on Wednesday night. ""I just thought (Allen) was huge,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They went small, they put Marvin (Williams) at the 5. We said we'll stick with JA, and I thought he did two great things. He guarded when we switched, he guarded their smalls, and then he punished them on the other end with his offensive rebounding."" Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie added 20 points apiece for Brooklyn. It marked the first time the Nets had three players score 20 or more points in a game. Terry Rozier had 18 points and Devonte' Graham added 17 for Charlotte, which lost its second straight game. Charlotte held the Nets to two points through the first five minutes of the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to 84-81. ""We're struggling to score the ball,"" Atkinson said. ""We're going to have to go to the drawing board and find some solutions there. It's tough to defend when you're not putting it in the hole. We have to get back to getting to the free throw line. I feel like we've slipped there. We're hanging out hat on our defense right now."" Prince agreed. ""I think our offense was sparked by the defense tonight,"" Prince said. ""I think we kept the lead when we needed to and it raised our level of intensity on the defensive end when we needed it to as well."" The Nets regrouped from their offensive slump to start the quarter by holding the Hornets to five points over the next five minutes. Prince's driving layup gave the Nets a 95-86 lead with 3:28 remaining during that span and they never looked back. ""I think they did a good job with their switching. I think their switching really slowed us down a little bit,"" Charlotte's Marvin Williams said. ""We got a little stagnant out there. We just have to continue to move the ball and move bodies to combat some of that switching. So, give those guys a lot of credit. They played well tonight."" Brooklyn held the Hornets to 73 points, the fewest the Nets have allowed through three quarters this season, to take a nine-point lead into the fourth quarter. Allen led the Nets with 11 points in the third. The Nets took a 56-51 lead into the locker room at the half as Prince and DeAndre Jordan led all scorers with 12 points apiece Both teams scored 26 apiece in the first quarter as Prince led the Nets with nine points and Bismack Biyombo scored eight for Charlotte. TIP-INS Hornets: Coach James Borrego credited Graham's strong start to studying Kemba Walker and Tony Parker last season. ... Charlotte shot 37%. Nets: Atkinson on Irving's injury status: ""I don't think it's a long-term thing. I wouldn't say we're being overcautious. . Do I think it's a long-term thing? No. I don't think he can play through it right now quite honestly. That's where we are. We'll see where that goes."" . Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) is also out for Brooklyn. CENTERS OF ATTENTION Allen's 22 points equaled the highest total he and Jordan had combined for in a game this season. They totaled 36 on Wednesday, with Jordan making all five shots in his 14-point outing.","401160847"
"MIAMI --  John Beilein had seen Duncan Robinson get on hot shooting stretches plenty of times before. None of those were at his expense. Robinson put on a show for his college coach -- and got himself into the Miami record book as well. He set team marks with seven 3-pointers in the second quarter, eight in the first half and finished with a career-high 29 points as the Heat rolled past Beilein and the Cleveland Cavaliers 124-100 on Wednesday night. ""That young man the last two years has developed with the Miami culture,"" said Beilein, the first-year Cavaliers coach who had Robinson for three seasons at Michigan. ""He's developed his game into a whole different level. ... Part of it you hate, but it's also part of your blood."" Robinson was 9 for 15 from the field, all of them coming from 3-point range. His early flurry helped Miami tie a franchise mark with 75 first-half points. The lead was 27 at the break and the Heat stayed in control the rest of the way. Kevin Love's jumper with 9:07 left got Cleveland to 102-86 and capped a 13-3 run, but the Cavs didn't get any closer. ""It's not lost on me that Coach B has done so much for my career,"" Robinson said. ""So it's pretty cool to have us competing on a stage like this. We're very competitive people so it's nice to come out on top, but I'm also very appreciative of everything he's done for me."" Tyler Herro scored 22 points for Miami, which had no problem on a night when Jimmy Butler missed 12 of his first 13 shots and finished with 21 points anyway. ""We can't keep surprising people,"" Butler said. ""We're for real. I don't think anybody wants to play against us and that's the way we want to keep it."" Love scored 25 and grabbed 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 19 points. The Heat record for 3-pointers in a game is 10, a mark held by Mario Chalmers and Brian Shaw. Robinson had three shots in the final moments to get his 10th -- missing them all. He connected on one with about 15 seconds left, but it was waved off by a shot clock violation. It was Cleveland's 17th consecutive loss in Miami, a stretch that started during the 2010-11 season -- LeBron James' first with the Heat after leaving the Cavaliers for the first time. The Heat record for 3-pointers in a half had been six, held by many and done most recently by Wayne Ellington in the second half against Toronto on April 11, 2018. The record for 3s in a quarter also was six -- Ellington did that twice (the Toronto game in 2018, and against Atlanta in 2017), and Shaw did it first against Milwaukee in 1993. Those marks belong to Robinson now. He had 24 points by halftime, all on 3-pointers. That was better than his previous career best of 23, set at home earlier this season against Houston. ""You couldn't be more happy for a guy like Duncan because he puts in so much time,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Robinson's high in three seasons under Beilein at Michigan was 21. His only 30-point effort in college came in 2014 -- for Williams against Amherst in the 2014 NCAA Division III semifinals, before he was given a scholarship by Michigan. His G League high last season was 36 for Sioux Falls. ""I'm really proud of him,"" Beilein said. ""All of Michigan is proud of him."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's 17-game losing streak at Miami has included 74 players and six coaches. The Cavs' last win in Miami was Jan. 25, 2010. ... Cleveland starters Cedi Osman, Darius Garland and Sexton were a combined 2 for 17 for seven points in 43 first-half minutes. They didn't start the second half. Heat: Miami improved to 10-3, tying the best 13-game start in team history. The 1995-96, 1999-2000, 2012-13 and 2013-14 Heat also were 10-3. ... Bam Adebayo was 4 for 4 in the opening three minutes and finished 5 for 5. ... Spoelstra improved to 533-366 in 899 games as Heat coach. His milestone 900th is Friday in Chicago. HEAT AT HOME The Heat are 6-0 at home, the first time that's happened since 2012-13. The biggest deficit they've faced at home this season is eight points -- every other team in the league has trailed by more at home at least once. THOMPSON RESTS The Cavaliers gave Tristan Thompson the night off to rest, mindful that they have a back-to-back later this week. It was the first game Thompson has missed this season -- but the third straight Cavaliers at Heat game in which he hasn't played.","401160848"
"TORONTO --  The Orlando Magic hit Toronto on a three-game winning streak. They limped out of town with two key starters hobbled by injuries. Fred VanVleet scored 24 points, Pascal Siakam had 18 points and 11 rebounds and the defending champion Raptors beat the Magic 113-97 on Wednesday night. Orlando lost center Nikola Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon to right ankle injuries in the second quarter. Vucevic used two crutches to leave the locker room afterward, while Gordon had one. It hurts not being able to play, not being able to help my team win, Gordon said. Gordon checked out with 8:27 left in the first half, seconds after ending up on the floor while trying to block Anunoby. It was basically a full jump, Gordon said. I came down and landed on the back of someones leg and rolled over. Thats why I knew it was hurt a little bit more, because I had jumped all the way up. Vucevic came in as the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week after after averaging 21.7 points, 14.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.33 blocks during Orlandos winning streak. He went down along his own baseline with 5:29 left in the second after injuring his ankle while trying to defend Norman Powells drive to the basket. It was really painful, Vucevic said. It was hard for me to put any pressure on. Well see. Im supposed to get an MRI (Thursday) and then Ill know more after that. Its pretty painful right now. Vucevic had to be helped to the locker room, unable to put weight on his right leg. He said X-rays came back negative. Orlando has second-year centre Mo Bamba and third-year big man Khem Birch ready to fill in, but coach Steve Clifford said theres no doubt his team will miss Vucevic. When you lose your best player, its hard to say you have more than enough, Clifford said. Still, Clifford refused to hang his head about Orlando's injury situation. You get up in the morning, you say Who do we have, and then you figure out the best way to have a good day with that group, he said. Thats all you can do in this league. Raptors rookie Terence Davis scored a career-high 19 points, Chris Boucher had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Norman Powell scored 15 points. Toronto improved to 6-0 at home and won for the eighth time in 10 meetings with the Magic. Forward Jonathan Isaac started for Orlando after missing the previous two games because of a sprained right ankle. Isaac played 33 minutes, scored 16 points and matched his career high with 13 rebounds. It was good to have him out there, Clifford said Obviously he adds so much to our team. I thought he played well, did a good job. Evan Fournier scored 21 points, Terrence Ross had 14 and Markelle Fultz added 12 for the Magic. Orlando is 0-5 on the road. VanVleet scored 20 or more for the fifth time this season. He had five 20-point efforts in 64 games last season. Its definitely impressive what hes been able to do, Siakam said about VanVleet. Hes just playing at a very high level right now. TIP-INS Magic: G Michael Carter-Williams said an MRI showed no structural damage to his injured left hip. Carter-Williams left in the second quarter of Sundays home win over Washington. There is no timetable for his return. ... Orlando scored 32 points in the first quarter but just 36 in the second and third combined. ... Birch scored a season-high 12 points. His career-high is 13.

Anunoby wore protective glasses to begin the game, but removed them midway through the first. He did not attempt a shot while wearing the glasses. NOT SO FAST For the first time this season, Toronto was outscored on fast break points. Orlando scored 16 fast break points while the Raptors had five, the first time this season theyve scored fewer than 11.

"Steve Kerr comments that he wants his team to completely forget about the historic 48-point loss they suffered to the Mavericks and look forward to their next challenge. (0:49) DALLAS --  The front of their jerseys said San Francisco and the names on the back werent the same Golden State Warriors that reached the past five NBA Finals. The Dallas Mavericks took full advantage. Luka Doncic scored 33 of his 35 points in the first half and had yet another triple-double to help Dallas hammer short-handed Warriors 142-94 on Wednesday night. Doncic fell a point short of matching Dirk Nowitzki's team record for points in a half, set Nov. 3, 2009, against Utah. Doncic was 10 for 11 from the floor, making 6 of 7 3-pointers, and hit 7 of 8 free throws. The second-year star from Slovenia was coming off a 40-point triple-double Monday. With his team up big on this night, Doncic played only 25 minutes total, but still managed 10 rebounds and 11 assists. He has an NBA-best seven triple-doubles in 14 games. If he had kept playing today, he probably would have had 50 (points), teammate Tim Hardaway Jr. said. Hes doing a great job playing with the utmost confidence. Doncic had 22 points, five assists and five rebounds in the first quarter alone. I see (the stats), but I dont know what to say, Doncic said. Its great to read about. I just enjoy the basketball. The Mavericks tied a franchise record with 22 3-pointers while sending Golden State to its worst loss since a 1973 playoff game. Flush it down the toilet, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said when asked what his team can take away from the game. Literally, you just move on. You dont take anything from a game like this. Rookie Eric Paschall led the Warriors with 22 points. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 20 for Dallas. Kristaps Porzingis had 14 points and 10 rebounds for his fourth-straight double-double. WOUNDED WARRIORS The Warriors are an NBA-worst 3-13. Their five-year run of at the top of the NBA has collapsed under a weight of injuries, with Draymond Green out Wednesday because of right heel soreness. With Green out, Golden State dressed only eight players, none of whom suited up for the team last season when it made the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive year. Kerr could at least find humor in the Warriors result. Tough to lose by 48 points, but a break here or there and it only would have been 42 points, Kerr said, then paused and added, Nobody caught the sarcasm? I was trying to be funny. SUPERNOVAS Paschall, Warriors teammate Omari Spellman and the Mavs Jalen Brunson all started for Villanova during their run to the 2018 national championship. All finished in double figures on Wednesday, with Brunson scoring 15 on a perfect 6-for-6 shooting night. Spellman had 11 for Golden State. Its always great playing against all my Villanova guys, said Paschall, holding Brunsons Dallas jersey that his former teammate had given him after the game. It proves what Coach (Jay) Wright has done. HARDAWAY MAKES IT LOOK EASY Hardaway got the start in place of Seth Curry, who was ill, and he took advantage of the assignment, tying his season high with 20 points. I just wanted to see a couple go in, Hardaway said. I wanted to go in there and make a presence for myself and for the team. TIP-INS Warriors: One of the few things that went the Warriors' way was when coach Steve Kerr challenged a defensive foul call on Willie Cauley-Stein with 1:56 left in the first half, and the call was reversed into an offensive foul on Dallas' Dwight Powell. Mavericks: Dallas previously made 22 3s in a game twice, the last time in February against Milwaukee.","401160850"
"CHICAGO --  After struggling with his shot for weeks, Lauri Markkanen said busting out of a slump Wednesday night was as simple as seeing the ball go through the basket. ""The shot's been feeling good the whole time,"" he said. ""That's why it was frustrating to see it come out. It feels good to see a couple go in."" Markkanen scored 24 points on 7-for-14 shooting, Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 points and 15 rebounds, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 109-89. It was Markkanen's first 20-point game since scoring 35 points on opening night. Tomas Satoransky and Shaquille Harrison each had 15 points as the Bulls snapped a three-game losing streak. ""I thought he was aggressive, I thought he ran the floor, I thought he got two real good ones at the rim early where he ran the floor,"" Chicago coach Jim Boylen said of Markkanen. ""I thought his effort was really good, and I thought he locked in defensively."" Derrick Rose had 18 points and Blake Griffin -- in just his third game of the season -- added 16 as the Pistons dropped their fifth straight. ""Defensively, it was a lack of effort tonight,"" Pistons forward Langston Galloway said. ""It was embarrassing, it really is embarrassing. We have to fight our way out of this. We're in a deep hole right now. We really have to step it up."" The Bulls won the first meeting between the teams 112-106 on Nov. 1, also at the United Center. Detroit's Andre Drummond finished with six points and 14 rebounds before fouling out with six minutes to go. Drummond had 25 points and 24 rebounds against the Bulls three weeks ago. Markkanen, who entered the game shooting just 36.2% from the field, had 15 first-half points on 5-for-8 shooting (including 2 for 2 on 3-pointers) as Chicago took a 59-55 halftime lead. That included an incredible six points on one possession late in the second quarter. Markkanen hit a 3-pointer while being fouled by Drummond, who was assessed a flagrant foul after review. Markkanen hit the free throw to complete the four-point play and then scored on a driving layup after the Bulls inbounded the ball. That stretch snapped a tie at 51 and gave the Bulls a 57-51 lead with 1:55 left. Chicago took an 84-71 lead after three quarters and then stretched it to 89-71 on five quick points by Thaddeus Young. The Bulls coasted from there. Markkanen hit a 3 with about 5 1/2 minutes to play for a 99-77 lead, Chicago's biggest of the game. TIP-INS Pistons: G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction) missed his 12th straight game. F Tony Snell (left hip strain) and G Khyri Thomas (right foot stress reaction) also sat out. Bulls: F Otto Porter (left foot) will be sidelined an additional two-plus weeks after a follow-up MRI taken on Tuesday revealed a bone bruise that wasn't discovered in the initial MRI two weeks ago. Porter will be re-evaluated in two weeks . F Chandler Hutchison, who had been starting in Porter's absence, sat out with inflammation in both shins ... G Coby White played despite spraining an ankle in pregame warmups and scored 12 points. DENG HONORED Luol Deng, who signed a one-day contract with the Bulls last month before retiring, was honored during the game. The 6-foot-9 forward played the first 10 of his 15 NBA seasons with the Bulls after being selected with the seventh pick of the 2004 draft. ""It's what makes sense,"" Deng said. ""Chicago means a lot to me. When you look back, coming here as a young kid, a young man, 19 ... there's a lot of history here and I wanted it to end the right way."" A video tribute was played during a timeout in the second quarter and several of Deng's former Bulls teammates -- including Joakim Noah and Ben Gordon -- attended the game. Deng said he picked this game because he wanted Rose to be present as well. STEPPING UP Harrison had played a total of 12 minutes before Wednesday, but was inserted into the starting lineup with Porter and Hutchison sidelined. Besides the 15 points (on 7-for-12 shooting), Harrison had 11 rebounds and five assists in 26 minutes. ""He stayed ready,"" Boylen said. ""It's really a credit to him. He's a winning dude.""","401160851"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  For the second time in three nights, the Utah Jazz watched the Minnesota Timberwolves fire away from 3-point range. The result was different this time. With the Wolves misfiring on 31 of their 45 attempts from the perimeter Wednesday night, Bojan Bogdanovic and Donovan Mitchell led a 3-point spree in the fourth quarter to help the Jazz to a 103-95 victory. Bogdanovic scored 30 points, Mitchell added 26 and the Jazz split the home-and-home series. ""I thought we touched a little bit tonight about the way we can play,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We were able to generate some 3s, and obviously Bojan. We had two stretches where it was tough for us and I thought our guys responded when the game got close."" Bogdanovic and Mitchell each hit three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. Bogdanovic was 6 of 11 from 3-point range, and Mitchell 5 of 10 to help Utah rebound for the home loss to Minnesota on Monday night. Minnesota led by six in the fourth quarter before Utah used a 12-0 run to take the lead for good. Mitchell hit a 3 with 5:09 left to give the Jazz a six-point lead. ""It all started with us penetrating the lane and having eyes out for our shooters,"" Jeff Green said. ""We have the shooters and if they try to take away one thing with a lob to Rudy (Gobert), it leaves shooters open. . It was big time for us."" Andrew Wiggins had 22 points for Minnesota after missing three games because of personal reasons and an illness. Karl-Anthony Towns was held to 14 points and struggled with foul trouble most of the night. It was a far cry from Monday night, when Towns hit tied a career-high with seven 3s and had 29 points in Minnesota's 112-102 win. On Wednesday, he didn't hit double figures until a 3 with 4:34 remaining, but Utah answered with back-to-back triples from Bogdanovic and Mike Conley to make it 94-85 at the 3:28 mark. ""You can tell . there was an emphasis on taking Karl out of it,"" Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Conley had 16 points for the Jazz, and Gobert had 12 points and 15 rebounds. Utah led by nine before Kelan Martin keyed a 12-0 run that put the Wolves up early in the fourth. WIGGINS' RETURN: Wiggins was listed as questionable earlier in the day, still feeling some effects from his illness, before deciding to give it a go. He looked sharp at times, although Saunders said he tried to give him a rest in the fourth. ""There was definitely some getting back into the swing of things,"" Saunders said. Wiggins finished 10 for 24 from the field, including 1 for 10 from 3-point range. He said his energy level felt better than his shots. ""Just missed a lot of easy shots, a lot of shots that I usually make, or would feel better. They didn't feel as good today,"" Wiggins said. MITCHELL'S FAN EXPERIENCE Mitchell bounced back after a sub-par night Monday when he scored 17 points on 5 for 23 shooting. He credited a trash-talking Minnesota fan for some extra motivation. ""I just said, `just wait because eventually it'll happen,"" Mitchell said. ""I think it's just one of those things you just have to have fun with in the game. I thank him because I was kind of struggling."" TIP-INS: Jazz: Gobert blocked five shots for the second time in three games. ... The Jazz took advantage of early foul trouble for Towns and Wiggins and jumped to an 11-point lead in the first quarter. Utah led by 11 before Minnesota tightened up defensively and reclaimed the lead with a 20-4 run. ... Ed Davis missed his eighth game with a fractured left fibula. Timberwolves: The perimeter wasn't the only place the Wolves struggled; Minnesota went 11 for 21 from the foul line. ... Saunders was given a technical in the first quarter. .... Shabazz Napier (hamstring) missed his ninth game. F Jake Layman (toe) was inactive after leaving Monday's game in the second quarter.","401160852"
"DENVER --  Rule No. 1 in defending James Harden: Throw different looks at him. Rule No. 2: See above. At least, that was Denver's highly effective blueprint. Nikola Jokic had 27 points and 12 rebounds, Denver played smothering defense on Harden and the Nuggets beat Houston 105-95 on Wednesday night to snap the Rockets' eight-game winning streak. ""You have to have rules against James Harden,"" Denver coach Michael Malone explained. ""You can't play him with your standard defense. Great player defense is required for great players."" So, the Nuggets tried a little bit of everything to contain Harden, even rolling the 7-foot Jokic out high along with another defender. The variety of schemes did the trick -- as much as it can against Harden. Houston's star playmaker finished with 27 points, snapping his string of eight consecutive games with 36 or more. He was 8 of 16 from the floor as the Rockets were held under 100 points for the first time this season. They were averaging an NBA-best 119.5 per game. ""We were locked in,"" said Jokic, whose team is 7-0 this season when keeping an opponent below 100 points. Still, Jokic found it funny that his team was being lauded for ""stopping"" Harden. ""That's crazy when a guy scores 27 and it's bad,"" Jokic said. ""We know he's going to score. He's going to be aggressive. Just make it harder and try to be there. ... Just to give them different looks."" It worked -- this time. ""They just double-teamed every possession,"" Harden said. ""They got lucky. They got away with one. We didn't execute how we needed to."" The Rockets struggled from 3-point range, hitting 12 of 38. They did make at least 10 for a 71st straight game dating to last season. Russell Westbrook finished with 25 points on 8-of-22 shooting and Clint Capela grabbed 21 rebounds. ""We had open shots,"" Westbrook said. ""We just didn't make them."" Will Barton scored 15 points, while Torrey Craig and Juancho Hernangomez provided boosts off the bench as Denver's reserves outscored the Rockets' backups by a 32-21 margin. One of the key sequences came in the third quarter, when Paul Millsap blocked Harden's shot and Barton turned it into a dunk on the other end. That energized the Pepsi Center crowd and sent the Nuggets on a pivotal run. It's not easy making things difficult for Harden, who's seen just about every defensive scheme imaginable. ""He's one of those guys that when you're watching film it's like watching a horror movie,"" Malone said. ""He's that talented."" TIP-INS Rockets: F Danuel House Jr. hurt his shoulder after running through a screen set by Jokic in the third quarter. House will be evaluated Thursday. ... G Ben McLemore was given a flagrant foul for a push in the fourth. Nuggets: Gary Harris and Jamal Murray each scored 10 points. CRAIG'S D Craig played a big role with three blocked shots in helping to limit Westbrook's damage. Craig knew he was getting under his opponent's skin when Westbrook lobbied to officials for foul calls. ""That's kind of a sign that I'm getting on his nerves a little bit,"" said Craig, who also turned in an impressive dunk. SPURTS The first quarter was filled with plenty of spurts -- a 7-0 run by Denver, soon followed by a 13-0 run for Houston and then a 15-0 run by the Nuggets. ELITE CATEGORY Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni sees Jokic in the same sort of category as Harden or Westbrook in being difficult to contain. ""He's going to do what he does. Same as James,"" D'Antoni said. ""I don't care what they do to James -- if he has a good game, it's because of James. If he has a bad game, it's because of James. Same with Russell. There are a few players that are that special."" NO FOULS Trying not to foul Harden is easier said than done. He drew a foul on a 3-pointer the Nuggets challenged, believing he kicked out his left leg, but the call on the floor stood. Harden was 7 of 10 from the free throw line. ""He's a master at drawing the foul,"" Malone said. ""They changed NBA rules because of James Harden.""","401160853"
"LOS ANGELES --  With Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Lou Williams on the court, the Boston Celtics had to pick someone to leave unguarded. They chose Patrick Beverley and he made them pay. Beverley shined on both ends, playing his usual ornery defense while scoring 14 points and grabbing a career-high 16 rebounds to help the Los Angeles Clippers win 107-104 in overtime with Leonard and George playing together for the first time Wednesday night. ""If I was a coach, I'd leave me open all the time,"" Beverley said. Williams scored 27 points, George added 25 and Leonard had 17 for the Clippers, who improved to 9-1 at home after rallying from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. In their first season with Los Angeles, injury and rehab had prevented Leonard and George from playing alongside each other for the first 14 games. ""It's still tough,"" said Leonard, who missed the previous three games with a sore knee. ""We're both on kind of minute restrictions so it's hard to get a flow."" George said he and Leonard are trying to get in sync with their other teammates. ""We're going to have growing pains,"" he said. ""The great thing about myself and Kawhi is it doesn't matter, we're going to play basketball. Try to make the right plays and play off each other and just keep the game flowing. I thought in that aspect we were good."" It was a wild and sloppy game for both teams. The Clippers committed 23 turnovers (Williams had seven while Leonard and George had five each) to 17 for the Celtics. ""That was an ugly win, but it was beautiful,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Leonard blocked Kemba Walker's potential tying 3-point attempt in the left corner. ""He got enough separation to get it off against most of the league,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""The problem is, that guy's not normal. He's not most of the league, and he made a great play to block it."" In overtime, George hit a 3-pointer after he missed his first attempt and Beverley got the offensive rebound, then George fed Beverley for a 3 of his own. George's free throw on a technical foul against Stevens completed a run of seven straight points, and the Clippers led 104-99. ""He literally singlehandedly willed that game with his effort, rebounding, making plays,"" Rivers said of Beverley, who got the game ball. ""He's a tough kid."" The Celtics pulled to 104-102 on Jayson Tatum's basket after a wild sequence in which bodies crashed to the floor as both teams chased a loose ball before Boston got possession. ""Defensive mistakes, costly turnovers,"" Tatum said. ""If we would have won it still would have been a learning experience."" Beverley hit a 3-pointer from the corner in front of the Clippers' bench for 107-102 lead, revving up Los Angeles fans and quieting the large contingent of Celtics fans in the stands. ""It was a playoff atmosphere,"" said Marcus Smart, who had 14 points for Boston. Tatum's basket left the Celtics down by three. Walker, who had 13 points, got free in the corner for the last shot but Leonard leaped to deflect it. Tatum led the Celtics with 30 points and Brad Wanamaker added 14. Williams hit a go-ahead 3 with 31 seconds remaining in regulation. With the crowd on its feet shouting ""Defense! Defense!"" Williams stole the ball at the other end and got fouled, making both for a 97-94 lead. After a timeout, Tatum hit a 3-pointer with George falling down defending him to tie it 97-all with 13 seconds left. Leonard's potential game-winning 3 rattled in and out as regulation ended. ""We've got some kinks to work out,"" Williams said. ""Just understanding what everybody brings to the table."" The Celtics led by 10 early in the fourth but got outscored 13-7 over the final 3:16. Boston missed 17 of 18 3-pointers in the first half. The Celtics then made seven 3s in the third quarter, with Tatum hitting four, to go into the fourth leading 75-69. Walker's 3-pointer pushed the Celtics to their largest lead, 86-76, in the fourth. The Clippers ran off eight points in a row, getting 3s from Beverley and Williams, to trail 86-84. Neither team led by more than 10 points in the game. Leonard and George combined to score the Clippers' first 11 points of the third for a 51-45 lead. That's when the Celtics kicked in from long range, with Tatum hitting back-to-back 3-pointers and Walker following with another. Tatum connected on consecutive 3s later in the period, too. TIP-INS Celtics: They dominated in the paint, 52-32. ... Daniel Theis had 14 rebounds and five fouls. Clippers: Their bench outscored the Celtics' reserves 43-29. ... The teams were even on the boards with 53 apiece. DUNK THIS Leonard got around Smart on his way to the basket and dunked one-handed over Theis in the fourth. ""That's Finals MVP,"" George said. ""He knows when it's time to take over. He's been there."" MANY MINUTES Leonard and George each played 37 minutes, which is more than Rivers would have liked. George had been kept around 28-30 since returning. ""This is preseason for me in terms of my condition and getting speed and playing at this level,"" George said. ""I was a little winded.""","401160854"
"MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee crowd greeted Carmelo Anthony with a loud ovation when the 10-time All-Star was introduced before the game. It cheered louder after the Bucks extended their winning streak to six straight. Giannis Antetokounmpo had his second triple-double of the season and Milwaukee beat Anthony and the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers 137-129 on Thursday night. ""Giannis is Giannis,"" Anthony said about the reining MVP. ""He's a tough check. I thought tonight we actually did a pretty good job. Even though he had a triple-double, when you look at that, it's like `Oh, he had a hell of a game.' But I thought, for the most part, we were back on him. We loaded up on him. He got some and-1s, he got going a little bit. ... He found some guys, they made some 3s, kind of opened the game up."" Antetokounmpo had 24 points, 19 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists to lead the Bucks to their seventh win in the last nine games against Portland. ""I couldn't get going offensively,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Shots weren't falling and they were showing a lot of crowds. I tried to find my teammates and they were in the right spots. They were able to knock down shots and to roll hard. I just did half of the work and my teammates did the rest."" Antetokounmpo, who also had a triple-double in the season opener, became the first player in franchise history to record a game with 20 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists. The 6-foot-11 forward has 16 career triple-doubles. Milwaukee is 14-2 in those games. Eric Bledsoe added 30 points and six assists in the Bucks' highest-scoring game of the season. After scoring 10 points on 4-of-14 shooting in 24 minutes in his season debut Tuesday night against the Pelicans, Anthony had 10 points in the first half Thursday. Anthony finished with 18 points (6-of-15 shooting) and seven rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who were without Hassan Whiteside (hip), Damian Lillard (back), Zach Collins (shoulder) and Jusuf Nurkic (leg). ""He's getting his sea legs after having that year off,"" Portland guard CJ McCollum said about Anthony. ""Getting used to that movement, getting used to how the game is flowing."" McCollum scored 37 points and Skal Labissiere added 22 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks for Portland. The Trail Blazers lost their third straight game overall and their sixth straight in Milwaukee. The Bucks made their first seven shots, including three 3s, and led 17-6. Milwaukee never trailed. The Bucks also had their highest first-half total, leading 72-58. The Blazers used a 40-point third quarter to close the gap and pulled within 117-115 with just over 7:00 play. But Brook Lopez and Wes Matthews hit back-to-back 3s to seal the Bucks victory. ""I thought we competed,"" McCollum said. ""I thought we played hard. Obviously, we came up short. But I thought it was a step in the right direction."" Milwaukee made 21 of 26 free throws against 12 of 14 for the Trail Blazers and outrebounded Portland 58-41. ""Keep in mind, their starting center (Lopez) didn't even get a rebound,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""So they did all that rebounding without even their center getting it. So they got them from a lot of different positions. We have to be aware of it. We can't assume that anybody else is going to get it. We don't have one guy that's going to go snatch all the rebounds. We gotta do it with five guys."" TIP-IN Antetokounmpo made his first career NBA start against Anthony. The date was Dec. 18, 2013. Giannis had 10 points and seven rebounds before fouling out. Carmelo scored 29 points in New York's victory.","401160855"
"PHOENIX --  Saddled with four fouls and struggling with his shot, Brandon Ingram stayed aggressive. It worked out quite well. Ingram scored 15 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and JJ Redick had 26 points, leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 124-121 win over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. ""Just seeing what the defense was giving me. I was forcing it a little bit in the first half,"" Ingram said. ""Not letting the game come to me. I tried to open up the floor a little bit by passing it to my teammates for shot on the wings, then finally finding attack space and knocking down shots."" Jrue Holiday had 23 points and nine assists for the Pelicans, who earned their third straight win. E'Twaun Moore added a season-high 19 points. Ingram's drive and strong finish at the rim while being fouled helped New Orleans open a 122-115 lead with 1:25 to play. But a technical foul, a turnover and a foul on a 3-pointer gave Phoenix a little hope. Holiday missed two free throws with 0.5 seconds to play, giving the Suns a chance to tie after a quick timeout. But the Suns couldn't get a good shot up. ""Anytime you can win on the road it's a great win, but obviously we have to do much better than that,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We have to be smarter down the stretch."" Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 25 points in its third consecutive loss. Devin Booker had 19 for the short-handed Suns, who were without starting center Aron Baynes and starting point guard Ricky Rubio. The Pelicans held the lead in the fourth quarter from start to finish. Phoenix got as close as two points down at 117-115 with 2:22 remaining. Ingram then made a turnaround jumper before his big three-point play, helping New Orleans pull away again. The Pelicans made their first 10 shots of the third quarter to take an 83-76 lead, with Redick scoring 10 points in that run. New Orleans didn't miss a shot until the 5:34 mark, but lost the lead briefly before carrying a 95-94 advantage into the fourth. ""We came out (in the third) and I think they scored 15 points in four minutes,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""There's no scheme for that, you just have to be more locked into the game."" Kenrich Williams' layup -- his only two points of the game -- off a pass from Ingram put the Pelicans ahead 105-96 at the 10:18 mark of the fourth quarter. Oubre's 3 at the second-quarter buzzer gave the Suns their largest lead of the half at 66-59. Oubre blew kisses to the crowd after the shot. He had 17 first-half points. Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball came off the bench and had eight points and five assists in his first game since Nov. 8. Ball had been dealing with a strained groin. ARENA PROJECT UNVEILED The Suns unveiled renderings and details of the planned renovation of Talking Stick Resort Arena during a pregame event at the nearby Phoenix Convention Center. Suns managing partner Robert Sarver went over the numerous upgrades for the Suns' home, which opened in 1992. The $230 million project is a joint effort between the team and Phoenix city government. ""Most importantly, (the project) will feature state-of-the-art improvements that will allow us to deliver a world-class guest experience to all of our great fans,"" Sarver said in a statement from the team.

"DETROIT --  About an hour after a blowout loss to the Detroit Pistons, Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce finally emerged to meet with reporters. The Hawks had been talking things over. ""Learning how to compete -- that's kind of it,"" Pierce said. ""Learning how to compete, learning how to communicate, what it takes to win in the NBA, what it takes to be a pro."" Atlanta allowed 76 points in the first two quarters -- the highest-scoring first half for the Pistons since 1983 -- and Detroit snapped a five-game losing streak with a 128-103 rout Friday night. It was the fifth straight loss for the Hawks and their eighth consecutive game allowing at least 120 points. Coaches generally hold their media sessions about 10 minutes after the game ends, but that was delayed a while this time. The Hawks were meeting to try to find some answers to their struggles. ""We've got a bunch of guys that don't really get to talk and actually say what they think,"" said DeAndre' Bembry, who led the team in scoring with 22 points. ""That was definitely one of those meetings where we're just expressing ourself, individually and collectively."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 15 rebounds for the Pistons. Detroit led 76-57 at halftime, and the Pistons reached 100 points with over five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Nine different Detroit players made at least one 3-pointer. Drummond wasn't one of them, but he scored his share of easy baskets inside. The Pistons actually trailed 17-7 before going on a 20-0 run that gave them a double-digit lead of their own before the end of the first quarter. It was 33-23 after one, then Detroit overwhelmed the Hawks with a 43-point second quarter that ended when Thon Maker of the Pistons made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""We're such a good shooting team, if we get good attempts and not turn it over,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. It was the most points in the first half for the Pistons since they scored 77 on Dec. 2, 1983, also against the Hawks. Detroit led 107-84 after three and finished the game with seven players in double figures. Blake Griffin scored 24 points and Bruce Brown added 14. Markieff Morris contributed 13 points. The Pistons shot 60 percent from the field and 17 of 34 from 3-point range. Pierce was asked if he got the response he wanted from the postgame meeting, but that remains to be seen. ""Nothing gets solved in those meetings, but what has to be said -- if you see something, you've got to say it,"" Pierce said. ""I had to say it, and they had to say it, and they had to hear it."" NOT THIS TIME Trae Young scored 38 points for Atlanta in a win at Detroit last month. He had only nine Friday, and Brown outscored him. ""Just ready tonight,"" Brown said. ""I don't think I was ready last time."" INJURIES Detroit is still without point guard Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction), and Tony Snell (left hip strain) missed this game as well. Atlanta was missing rookie Cam Reddish (left wrist sprain), as well as Kevin Huerter (left rotator cuff strain) and John Collins (doping suspension). TIP-INS Hawks: De'Andre Hunter scored 18 points and Jabari Parker added 14. Pistons: Detroit had not scored 76 points in either half since the Pistons scored 76 in the second half against Washington on Feb. 7, 1995. ... Langston Galloway scored 12 points, giving him a career-best 11 consecutive games in double figures. ... The 20-0 run was the team's longest since a 24-0 run at Portland on Nov. 8, 2015.","401160857"
"WASHINGTON --  The Washington Wizards defense remains a soft spot. At least its rising to the occasion lately. Bradley Beal had 30 points and 12 assists, Thomas Bryant added 21 points and 11 rebounds, and the Wizards overcame a 13-point deficit with a stingy fourth quarter in their 125-118 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. Davis Bertans added 20 points off the bench, hitting six 3-pointers as the Wizards won two in a row for the first time this season. Jordan McCrae scored eight of his 13 in the fourth, including a baseline 3 that put Washington in front for good. It was important -- it was beyond important, Beal said about the victory. For one, just protecting our house. But two, it gives us a little bit of flow, some juice moving forward. The Hornets were on pace to set a season high for points until the Wizards held Charlotte to 22 in the fourth quarter while forcing eight turnovers. A game earlier, a team that holds the NBAs second-worst defensive rating limited San Antonio to one field goal over a 5:43 stretch of the third period during a decisive run. Those are steps for us in the right direction, Beal said. Weve still got to get those points down. Were still giving up way too many points. Beal extended his career-best streak of scoring 30 or more to five games as the Wizards snapped a three-game skid against the Hornets. Miles Bridges had a career-high 31 points for Charlotte, which has now lost at least three in a row for a third time this season. Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier and Malik Monk each added 19 for the Hornets. Down 13 early in the fourth after Charlottes 11-2 run, Washington replied with 11 straight points and ultimately outscored the Hornets 29-9 down the stretch. I think their physicality picked up, Charlotte coach James Borrego said. We started turning the ball over too much. Just something weve got to continue to work on. Bertans hit his final 3 off Beals feed to close the margin to four, and Beal drove the lane, got fouled and sank a pair of free throws to make it 109-107 with 6:13 left. Several possessions later, Bertans spotted McCrae for a baseline 3 to put Washington up 116-114. And later, McCraes contested runner just about sealed the win, making it 122-116 with 29 seconds remaining. Just playing off Brad, McCrae said. Hes doing a lot out there -- handling, guarding, scoring for us. So for us, weve got to be ready to shoot when he throws it. TIP-INS Hornets: Went 8 for 15 (53%) from 3-point range in the first half.  Despite being 16 games into the season, this was Charlottes first against a Southeast Division rival. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks played a starting five of Beal, Bryant, Troy Brown Jr., Rui Hachimura and Isaiah Thomas for the sixth time, his most-used combination this season.  Moritz Wagners buzzer-beating 3 pulled Washington to 34-33 at the end of the first quarter.  Bertans tied his career high for 3-pointers. BENCH BONANZA Washington entered with the NBAs second-highest scoring bench and built upon that with a 50-point showing. Bertans, McCrae and Ish Smith were among those second-unit players still on the floor down the stretch. I think thats big for our team, McCrae said. Our team is deep. Anytime, the coach can go with anybody. That just is a testament for guys on the bench to be ready at all times. BRIDGES BREAKOUT Bridges, a second-year pro, easily eclipsed his previous career high of 23 points set in October and it marked only the third time in 96 games hes reached 20 points. The secret?

Then my shot started falling and just went from there.","401160858"
"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets usually do well when they hold opponents under 100 points. They did it again Friday night for the second straight game. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 23 points and Joe Harris added 22 in the Nets' 116-97 victory over the Sacramento Kings. Brooklyn is 34-6 under coach Kenny Atkinson when keeping opponents under 100. ""We're just trying to play good basketball, play the right way,"" Harris said. ""We've done a better job here lately defensively. When you're able to get stops, things offensively come a lot easier."" Garrett Temple finished with 18 points, Jared Allen had 11 points and nine rebounds, and DeAndre Jordan added 10 rebounds for the Nets. Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 18 points. Buddy Hield had 16, Justin James 14, Nemanja Bjelica 13 and Richaun Holmes 12 as Sacramento shot 4 of 26 from 3-point range. ""If you're a 3-point shooting team and you shoot 15 percent, you're not going to win a lot of games,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""Brooklyn also beat us up on the glass."" The Nets outrebounded the Kings 48-33, matching their highest differential of the season. Temple's 3-pointer opened the scoring and Brooklyn never trailed in the game. Leading 26-23 after the first quarter, the Nets began the second on a 17-8 run to open a 12-point lead at 43-31. The Kings, with Hield scoring 14 first-half points, pulled within seven at halftime, 56-49. Temple's 3-pointer capped a 10-2 run and gave the Nets a 15-point lead, 66-51. The Kings were able to get back within 10 points at 72-62, but Dzanan Musa's two free throws with 39 seconds left gave the Nets a 16-point lead after three quarters. ""Looking at all our games before this, the third quarter was really our crutch,"" Allen said. ""Now we're getting rid of it and we're running full speed."" Jordan's dunk midway through the fourth made it a 22-point advantage at 104-82. ""I think our defense was outstanding again,"" Atkinson said. ""We talked about it pregame. I thought they were active, just a lot of deflections, forcing turnovers, so that's good news.""

"Joel Embiid contends that he will no longer participate in trash talking because the 76ers need him to be on the floor. (0:38) PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia coach Brett Brown met Gregg Popovich at midcourt, gave him a handshake, hug and pat on the back. Brown knows all about long losing streaks, and Popovich helped him get through them. Now it's Brown's turn to help. Tobias Harris scored 26 points, Joel Embiid had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat San Antonio 115-104 on Friday night to hand the Spurs their eighth consecutive defeat. The skid is the Spurs' worst under longtime coach Popovich. ""Figured it was something like that,"" Popovich said. A former Spurs assistant under Popovich, Brown endured an NBA-record 28-game losing streak during Philadelphia's rebuilding project early in his tenure. Usually loquacious, Brown didn't have much to say about sending his mentor to the longest skid of his career. ""I love him. He knows that,"" Brown said. ""He coaches hard, he moves on."" Ben Simmons had a triple-double with 10 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, who improved to 6-0 at home. DeMar DeRozan had 29 points and Rudy Gay scored 22 for the Spurs. ""I thought the effort was good, just a bad start again,"" Popovich said. ""We're just trying to not make as many mistakes, mostly at the defensive end because it always puts us in a bad way. We're working at it."" DeRozan said Popovich has remained positive despite the losing streak. ""He's extremely optimistic, doesn't panic,"" DeRozan said. ""He keeps our spirits up high, keeps our confidence up high. Got to keep our heads up."" San Antonio last dropped eight in a row in November 1996 under coach Bob Hill. Popovich was the team's general manager at the time. He fired Hill later that season and began his long run of success. In his 24th season, Popovich has won five NBA titles and gone to the playoffs in 22 straight seasons while compiling a winning record in each of those 22 campaigns. He has spent just 74 days with a losing record over the past 22 seasons. Prior to the recent slump, Popovich hadn't lost seven consecutive games since Feb. 23 to March 5, 1997. ""He felt sorry for me in my early years,"" Brown said. ""He's amazing. His competitiveness is incredibly admirable. Nothing I respect more that Pop has achieved than longevity."" Popovich said the sting of losing was slightly lessened due to the opponent. ""If you lose to [Brown], for some strange reason it doesn't hurt quite as bad,"" he said. ""You're a little bit happy for him -- just a little."" San Antonio trailed most of the way but got within one late in the third quarter before the 76ers pulled away in the fourth. It was 101-95 with just under six minutes left when Popovich elected to intentionally foul Simmons for the second straight trip down court. A 58% free throw shooter, Simmons missed both attempts the first time but drained both shots on his subsequent trip to the line to put Philadelphia ahead 103-95 with 5:34 remaining. Furkan Korkmaz hit a 3-pointer from the corner on Philadelphia's next possession and then Harris made a layup to put the 76ers comfortably ahead, 108-97, with 4:24 left. BROWN BACKER The pressure has intensified on Brown after the team's early playoff exits the last two seasons and a so-so start to 2019-20. Brown acknowledged as much before the game, saying his job ""has been in question since the day I took it."" However, Popovich doesn't believe Brown should be receiving scrutiny. Brown spent 11 seasons with the Spurs. ""Fans don't know crap,"" Popovich said. ""He's one hell of a guy and the most positive guy I've ever known. He's going to work his ass off. They are lucky to have him."" TIP-INS Spurs: Derrick White (left foot) missed his second consecutive game. 76ers: Josh Richardson (right hip flexor) didn't play. ...

"CHICAGO --  Jimmy Butler is turning into a perfectionist. Butler had 27 points against his former team and the Miami Heat beat the Chicago Bulls 116-108 on Friday night for their fifth straight victory. Butler played for the Bulls from 2011-17. He was 7 of 10 from the field and had seven assists and five rebounds Bam Adebayo added 16 points and 14 rebounds, and Kendrick Nunn scored 13 of his 21 points in the first quarter to help Miami improve to 11-3. The Heat led wire-to-wire and had as much as a 26-point lead. Despite a 11-3 record and a five-game winning streak, Butler wasn't happy to see the lead dwindle to single digits in the fourth quarter. ""A win is a win. I'm not going to downplay that none, but I think the way we have been winning is not the way we would like to win. We played great basketball in the first half. I think we are all proud of that, but then we just have these mental lapses night after night. It just can't happen if we want to be as good as we say we want to be,"" said Butler. Zach Lavine led the Bulls who finished with 15 points. Chicago is 3-6 at home this season. Bulls coach Jim Boylen pulled LaVine and the other starters midway through the first quarter. ""I just pulled him. Not combative. Guys know. Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen and our starters got to play better for us to become what we can become. That's how it works,"" Boylen said. ""I want him to be a two-way player. That's what I want him to be."" LaVine thought he was used as the scapegoat for the Bulls' struggles. ""I guess I was to blame for it,"" LaVine said. ""I've gotten pulled early before by him. I guess that's just his thing to do. Just got to take it in stride. I'm not the coach."" Nunn, making his Chicago homecoming, scored 13 points in the first quarter on 5-for-7 shooting. Nunn blew by Markkanen several times and was 3-of-5 from 3-point range in the quarter. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was concern how Nunn would handle his return to Chicago after watching Dwyane Wade struggle in his first few games in Chicago. ""When he has 40 points or if he has zero points, what his facial expression and body language looks like, it would look the same, so I don't know why I even though it potentially could be an issue with him,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's a very serious guy about this game and approach. He understands this is a tremendous opportunity for him and our team. He's gone through a lot and overcome a lot to get to this point and he's trying to take advantage of everything as well as he should."". NO PHILLY LOVE? Butler returns to Philadelphia on Saturday after playing 55 games for the 76ers last season. Butler was traded last to the 76ers from Minnesota. Butler he isn't sure how the Philly crowd will react, nor does he care. ""To tell you the truth, I don't care. I was there and gave my all for them,"" Butler said. ""But I'm here so however they want to welcome me back. We're (there) to do a job anyway, trying to get a W."" TIP-IN The Bulls played without Chandler Hutchison and Otto Porter. Hutchison is out with shin splits and Porter is out with a left foot sprain. The Heat played without Justise Winslow, who was out with a concussion. ...

"LeBron James admits missing his son Bronny Jr.'s high-school debut was ""bittersweet,"" but is appreciative of technology for being able to stream the game. (0:30) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Being coachable paid off for Anthony Davis. The star forward scored 24 of his 33 points in the second half to help the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 130-127 on Friday night. He got in a rhythm after coach Frank Vogel told him to stop hesitating. ""When I hesitate, I tend to come up short or a bad miss,"" Davis said. ""And it seems to be going in a lot more when I don't hesitate."" Davis also had 11 rebounds and seven assists, and the Lakers needed all of it. Though the Thunder have struggled this season, they played the Lakers close this week in Los Angeles and entered the night with a 5-3 home record, including a victory over Philadelphia last week. ""We find a way to win no matter what the game is,"" said LeBron James, who had 23 points and 14 assists. ""This is a very good team at home. They've struggled on the road a little bit, but we knew they were going to give it their best punch, especially just playing them on Tuesday in LA."" The Lakers won their sixth straight and own the league's best record at 13-2. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and Steven Adams added 22 for the Thunder, who have lost five of six. Los Angeles guard Rajon Rondo was ejected early in the fourth quarter after a kick to Dennis Schroder's groin area. Schroder made two free throws, and then Gilgeous-Alexander's layup tied the game at 109. ""I didn't think it called for an ejection, but the refs have to do what they feel best fits,"" James said. ""But, you know, I didn't think it called for an ejection."" Davis hit a corner 3 and was fouled by Adams, then made the free throw to put the Lakers ahead 126-121 with 2:36 to play. Oklahoma City's Chris Paul made a layup with 11.8 seconds left that cut the Lakers' lead to 126-125. Davis was fouled with 8.1 seconds left, and he made both free throws. Gilgeous-Alexander's layup with 4.2 seconds left trimmed the margin to one again, but Davis made two more free throws with 3.8 seconds remaining. James intercepted Oklahoma City's inbounds pass and ran out the clock. ""Credit OKC,"" Vogel said. ""They played an outstanding game tonight on both ends of the floor. They really competed and made big shots all night."" It was Oklahoma City's seventh loss by five points or fewer this season. ""Yeah, it's kind of stupid, to tell you the truth,"" Paul said. ""Don't know if that's the right word, but me and Shai was talking about like, you know, we are fighting. This is our job. We are supposed to (win), so we've got to figure it out.

"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic finally had a chance to give former teammate Dirk Nowitzki a live look at how the Dallas Mavericks are coming along without the best player in franchise history. Not too bad so far. Doncic had 30 points and 14 assists with Nowitzki watching courtside next to owner Mark Cuban, and the Mavericks won by more than 40 points for the second straight game, routing the Cleveland Cavaliers 143-101 on Friday night. Nowitzki stayed away for the first eight Dallas home games after setting an NBA record of 21 seasons with the same franchise while finishing last season as the highest-scoring foreign-born player in league history. The big German got a standing ovation when shown on the video board in what was also his first peek in person at Dallas' new European pairing of Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, the 7-foot-3 Latvian who missed his five shots but made his last six, finishing with 17 points. ""I'm here to make this franchise, make this team a better team,"" said Porzingis, who also had four blocks in his 200th career game. ""I'm trying to do my part. I'm sure Luka's trying to do his part. He's doing it well. ""As I said before, those are some huge shoes that we have to fill with Dirk ending his career and how high he set the standard for this organization."" Rookie Darius Garland scored a career-high 23 points for the Cavaliers, who lost their sixth straight game while getting swept in a second consecutive season series against Dallas. Cleveland lost at home by 20 early this month. ""They can really shoot,"" coach John Beilein said. ""The couple of shots that Porzingis made and Luka made, you can't defend them. They're stepping back, they've got great size and they're shooting it in from 30 feet. Really a talented team."" Dallas (10-5) moved five games above .500 for the first time since late in the 2015-16 season, which ended up being Nowitzki's final trip to the playoffs after leading the franchise to its only championship in 2011. Nowitzki gave a hint that he might be on the way by tweeting about the traffic near his old home arena on the street that was renamed in his honor before the season started. ""Awesome,"" coach Rick Carlisle about seeing Nowitzki in the arena, while quickly noting that Shawn Marion, also retired, and guard J.J. Barea were nearby. All three played important roles in the championship. Doncic is the first Dallas player to score at least 30 points in three straight games since Nowitzki in 2010, but is still waiting to record three straight triple-doubles for the first time. For the third time in the rookie of the year's two seasons, the 20-year-old Slovenian fell short, finishing with seven rebounds while sitting all of the fourth quarter for the second straight game. Porzingis also was on the bench the whole fourth two nights after Dallas led Golden State by 50 in the second half of a 142-94 win. The final margin of 42 was also the Mavericks' biggest lead against the Cavaliers in their first sweep of a four-game homestand since the title year. ""A lot of guys did a lot of good things,"" Carlisle said. ""It's a successful homestand, and we've done some good things. But the schedule's going to get a lot more difficult now.""

Murray scored 22 points, including two clutch free throws with 1.5 seconds remaining, and the Nuggets hung on to beat the Celtics 96-92 on Friday night in a game overshadowed by a head injury to Boston guard Kemba Walker. ""That's not something you want to mess around with,"" Murray said. ""Prayers out to him and hopefully he's fine."" Nikola Jokic added 18 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists for the Nuggets, who improved to 8-0 this season when holding an opponent to fewer than 100 points. Jaylen Brown had 22 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Celtics. Jayson Tatum added 16 points and Marcus Smart had 15. Walker collided with teammate Semi Ojeleye late in the second quarter, striking Ojeleye's abdomen area head-first and going down on to the court in a heap. Walker grimaced in pain as he went down and play was stopped as medical personnel from both teams tended to the star guard who was prone on the floor for several minutes. His teammates gathered round as did Nuggets players, plainly concerned about Walker. A brace was placed around his neck to stabilize the area and he was strapped to a backboard before being placed onto a gurney and wheeled off the court in front of a hushed crowd. ""I saw him in the ambulance at halftime,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""He had his wherewithal about him. He was in decent spirits, which is good."" In a tweet, the Celtics said Walker has been diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms and was transported to a hospital for further evaluation. Walker, the Celtics' leading scorer, had three assists and a pair of steals before leaving the game. ""Our prayers and our energy are with him,"" Brown said. ""He's probably the smallest dude on the floor every time he steps out, but he's probably got the biggest heart. We definitely lean on him and we'll welcome him back when he rests up and everything is taken care of."" Earlier this month, the Celtics lost Gordon Hayward to a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury when he collided with LaMarcus Aldridge in a Nov. 9 game against San Antonio. The Celtics, down by 19 in the third quarter and 13 to start the fourth, went on a 10-1 run capped by Brad Wanamaker's driving layup to pull to 75-73 with 5:35 left to play. Brown connected on a 3-pointer from the corner, pulling the Celtics to 84-83 with 2:18 remaining. Murray made a pair of free throws and hit a jumper around a Boston turnover as the Nuggets went in front 88-83. Boston added a basket but Paul Millsap connected on a 3-pointer, helping fend off the Celtics in the waning seconds. The Nuggets took their 70-57 lead into the fourth with Michael Porter Jr. punctuating the advantage by soaring above the rim to rebound a missed shot and slam it through the net in the final moments of the third. Denver led by 17 in the first half before the Celtics put together an 11-0 run in the second quarter, pulling to 45-34 at the half. TIP-INS Celtics: Hayward is making progress in his recovery from the broken left hand he suffered during a Nov. 9 game against San Antonio.

"LOS ANGELES --  Down five points with a minute to go, the Los Angeles Clippers turned to a trio of veterans. Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Lou Williams combined to outscore the Houston Rockets 10-2 the rest of the way and Leonard hit the winning jumper with 15 seconds remaining for a 122-119 victory Friday night. ""We made shots, got stops, we played with confidence,"" said Williams, who led the Clippers with 26 points -- all in the second half. Leonard finished with 24 points and George added 19 in the superstars' second game together. Montrezl Harrell had 18. ""We fight hard. We leave it all out there on the court,"" Harrell said. ""We never feel like we're out of a game."" P.J. Tucker's turnaround hook put the Rockets up by five with a minute left. George hit a 3-pointer to trim the margin to two, and JaMychal Green blocked Clint Capela's shot at the other end. Williams then drained a 3 from the right corner that gave the Clippers a 118-117 lead with 30 seconds remaining. James Harden made a pair of free throws for a one-point Houston lead before Leonard's pull-up jumper gave Los Angeles the lead for good. ""Lou set a great pick,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""All Kawhi needs is an inch and he got it."" Russell Westbrook missed at the other end and George got the rebound while getting fouled. He made both free throws with one second left to complete a wild finish and help the Clippers improve to a franchise-best 10-1 at home with their fourth win in a row overall. ""You got Lou, Kawhi and Paul George. They're going to be composed,"" Rivers said. ""They've been in big games. Each one made a big shot down the stretch."" Harden scored 37 points, making a career-high 11 3-pointers and sinking 14 of 18 free throws. He also had 12 assists. Westbrook added 22 points before fouling out late, and Capela had 17 points and 19 rebounds. Those three plus Tucker had at least four fouls. ""We didn't finish the way we needed to, obviously, but we were very, very confident,"" Harden said. The teams traded leads in the fourth with neither leading by more than four until the final 1 1/2 minutes. The Clippers are still honing their chemistry, having just gotten Leonard and George together in games. ""We're basically learning within these games, but there comes a time in the game where it feels like we find a way,"" George said. ""We execute at the right times. We find the stops we need at the right times."" Because of their schedule, the Clippers haven't been able to have full practices. Most of their work gets done at game-day shootaround. ""I think probably we get in a little rhythm in the fourth quarter,"" Leonard said. ""Not being able to practice with each other, when we go out there we start seeing what the opponent's doing on both ends of the floor and kind of just get into a rhythm. We play our best basketball in the fourth quarter. Everyone's trying to make shots, execute and play great defense."" There were none of the theatrics that marked their last meeting, an overtime win by the Rockets in Houston on Nov. 13. Harden scored 47 points, Rivers got ejected with his rival son Austin egging on the referees and Westbrook disparaged Patrick Beverley's defense on Harden. Beverley and Ivica Zubac were in foul trouble for the Clippers. The Rockets took their first lead of the game on Harden's 3-pointer during a 16-2 run, including 11 straight points, early in the third. He got fouled and made the free throw before hitting another 3 and Westbrook followed with one of his own that helped put the Rockets up 70-59. The Clippers regrouped and finished off the quarter on a 21-14 spurt to trail 84-80 going into the fourth. Williams scored 14 points in the period. The Clippers led by 14 in the second. That's when Houston closed on a 19-9 run to trail 55-51 at halftime. TIP-INS Rockets: They fell to 5-4 on the road. ... Harden and Westbrook are averaging 20-plus points per game.

Daniel House Jr. missed his fourth straight game with a sacral contusion. Clippers: Landry Shamet is off crutches but remains out with a high ankle sprain. NO TIME OUT The Rockets were annoyed that Doc Rivers was on the court trying to call a timeout during a play that resulted in a 3 in the closing seconds for Los Angeles. ""No one saw me,"" the coach said, referring to the referees. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said, ""We had three officials and nobody saw him out there so it is what it is. The whole team saw him out there. Everyone saw him out there. That was a big play."" NEW LOOK The Clippers wore their new city edition jerseys for the first time. They feature Los Angeles in an Old English font inspired by L.A. artist Mister Cartoon. The jersey is mostly white and black with hints of blue and red, a nod to the team's main colors. The city's name appeared on the court in Old English font and the court featured Los Angeles geography woven into its black border through lines mapping out the city's roads and highways. The Clippers will wear the uniforms at 16 other games this season, including on Christmas against the Lakers. ""I like them a lot,"" Williams said.","401160866"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Devin Booker had the ball, and a defensive switch left him staring at an old friend on the perimeter. Teammates spread out to give Booker the spacing he needed, and the dynamic guard drove to the hoop before stopping for a step-back jumper over 7-foot Karl-Anthony Towns. Booker got the best of Towns as the former Kentucky Wildcats tried to make up for their short-handed squads. Booker had 35 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, and the Phoenix Suns stopped a three-game slide by holding off the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 100-98 victory on Saturday. ""I try to find certain games, when to be aggressive, when to not, when to make a play for other people when two are guarding me,"" Booker said. ""Tonight, I got it going a little bit late."" Kelly Oubre Jr. added 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who played without starting point guard Ricky Rubio and center Aron Baynes due to injuries. Phoenix was clinging to a 98-95 lead when Towns missed a hurried 3-pointer with 9.2 seconds left from just inside the half-court line. Booker then iced the game with a pair of free throws. ""He's not afraid of the moment,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""You can take him for granted sometimes. But I don't. When you have a special player like that, you have to recognize it. I constantly talk to our guys about how he generates a lot of their open looks because of the attention that he draws."" Phoenix shot a season-low 34.4% from the field but tied a season low with seven turnovers. It also made 24 of 26 foul shots, outscoring Minnesota by 14 from the line. Towns had 31 points and 17 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who have lost four of five. Keita Bates-Diop scored a career-high 22 points, and Andrew Wiggins added 21. ""Just didn't follow our system, we didn't make shots,"" Towns said. ""It's obviously a little hard to get in rhythm when you ain't making anything. They didn't go through tonight."" Booker's 17 points in the third quarter helped Phoenix regain control after the Wolves tied the game. When Minnesota closed within two in the final minutes, Booker scored in the lane over Towns. Wiggins answered, but Booker was there on the other end for a pair of free throws. ""We ran everything through him on offense tonight,"" the Suns' Frank Kaminsky said. ""It was one of those nights you could tell he was being aggressive. Just getting him in actions, trying to get switches, get mismatches. And he was taking advantage of it."" ROTATION ISSUES Minnesota played without Robert Covington (personal reasons), Josh Okogie (left knee soreness), Jake Layman (left toe sprain) and Shabazz Napier (right hamstring strain). It was the second time in four games Okogie has been out with the injury. Layman missed his second straight game. Treveon Graham was listed as available with a left arm contusion but didn't play. ""You can say they're three of our top four defenders, in a way,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said of Covington, Okogie and Graham. ""Or maybe our three best. They impact the game with activity, too."" TIP-INS Suns: Rubio was out of the lineup for the third time in four games with back spasms. Baynes, who has been starting in place of the suspended Deandre Ayton, missed his third straight game with a right hip flexor strain. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  One night after questioning his relationship with coach Jim Boylen, the Chicago Bulls' Zach LaVine came through with a big game. LaVine had a career-high 49 points, including the winning 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to give the Bulls a 116-115 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. He shot 17 for 28 from the field, including 13 for 17 on 3s to tie an NBA record. Only Golden State's Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson had previously made 13 from beyond the arc in an NBA game. The night before, LaVine was pulled from the game early in the first quarter after Miami had taken a 13-0 lead. After that 116-108 home loss, LaVine said he sensed a lack of trust from Boylen. All was forgotten after Saturday's spectacular individual performance and dramatic comeback. ""Like I've been saying, we've been playing good in stretches,"" LaVine said. ""We just executed to perfection down the stretch. Obviously, you know, we got blessed a little bit with some luck. We can take this energy and go on to the next game. ""Hopefully this is that turning point for us. Every team has it. This could be a big step for us in the right direction."" Rookie Coby White, who starred at the University of North Carolina and playing in front of hundreds of family and friends from his hometown of Goldsboro, N.C., added 28 points for Chicago. LaVine's late bucket ended a flurry for the Bulls, who trailed by five with less than 10 seconds left before Tomas Satoronsky hit a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds remaining. On the last play, LaVine scooped up the loose ball after White forced a turnover by Devonte Graham. ""Once I saw the ball on the ground I was going for it,"" said LaVine, who scooped up the basketball, stepped behind the 3-point line and fired in the game-winner. LaVine, who entered averaging 19.5 points per game, started his 17th straight game and hit his first three shots -- all 3s -- and two free throws for 11 points in the first 7 1/2 minutes of the game and stayed hot the rest of the night. ""I've always said Zach is a really good guy, and a good person and he wants to do well,"" Boylen said. ""He wants to help the team. ... My job is to push the guy to a place he can't take himself and that happens sometimes with tough conversations, meetings and maybe some uncomfortable moments but that's what my job is. The credit needs to go to him and his focus, energy and his effort. ""He is always good when we coach him and talk to him. He wants to play better, I want him to play better and I am really happy for him."" Terry Rozier III had a game-high 28 points for Charlotte. Marvin Williams scored 19 of his 21 points in the second half as the Hornets recovered from a 14-point deficit in the first half and led by 11 early in the fourth quarter. The Hornets were still ahead by seven at 112-105 with 32.1 seconds left. ""I mean that's just a tough, tough loss,"" said Graham, who had 18 points. ""Especially for me, turning the ball over right there in that situation. But Zach made an extreme shot and you just have to tip your hat to him for that."" Charlotte's previous six victories had come in games in which they had trailed by 10 or more points. And Saturday's game was seconds away from a seventh win after overcoming a double-digit deficit. ""There was a lot of good to get back in that game,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""I thought our guys played inspired. We won the boards and we won the paint. We did a number of things very well in this game. Gave ourselves a great shot, a great opportunity there, we just have not been able to close these last few games. ""You've got to give them credit. LaVine obviously made some incredible shots there down the stretch."" TIP INS: Bulls: When told pregame the NBA was considering changes that would alter the regular season and postseason schedules, Boylen offered his blanket support. ""I'm a huge Adam Silver fan and I'm going to worry about coaching my team,"" Boylen said of the league commissioner. ""If they feel that's best for the league and all of us, we're all reaping the benefits of what's been laid down by the league office. And I'll continue to trust that. Whatever they want, I'll support."" Hornets: Veteran swingman Nic Batum missed the first 11 games of the regular season after suffering a broken finger in his left hand in the preseason. Though he's been coming off the bench, Hornets coach James Borrego applauded Batum's return to his lineup before Saturday's game. ""He's done a good job,"" Borrego said. ""I think he's been a real asset for us on the defensive end. His length, his experience, playmaking, secondary play maker. He's getting his legs underneath him these last few games, so I think he's doing well.""","401160868"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  With the game on the line, Indianas Holiday brothers leaned on the chemistry theyve been building since childhood. Justin Holiday could have taken a contested shot to break a 106-all tie between the Pacers and the Orlando Magic, but instead he dished to younger brother Aaron, who despite missing his previous 3-pointers didnt hesitate to drill the go-ahead shot with 8.7 seconds remaining as Indiana beat Orlando 111-106 on Saturday night. Aaron said he hand his brother have practiced those scenarios for years. For sure, thats what we dreamed about when we were younger, Aaron said. Im obviously a confident guy. Hitting the 3 at the end, I was going to shoot it no matter what. Even though I missed the last few, one has got to go in for me. Justin drove to draw Aarons defender away before dishing to his brother. The missed shots dont matter at that point, Justin said. It was the right basketball play. I passed it to him and thought, Hes going to make this. Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 25 points, including 20 in the first three quarters, but the Magic led by two points entering the fourth. After Aarons clutch shot, Justin sealed the outcome when he recognized the Magics formation from the last time these teams played 13 days ago and intercepted the inbounds pass. He was fouled and hit two free throws for the final points. I was sitting there, waiting for it, Justin said. His brother expected more from that play. He did a great job on defense for us at the end of the game, Aaron said. He should have went in and dunked the ball, but well talk about that later. The Pacers have won six of seven at home and 11 of their past 13 against the Magic, who are winless in six road games. Evan Fournier scored 26 points and Jonathan Isaac had 25 for the Magic. We played well enough to win, Isaac said. It just sucks the way the game ended. The Magic lamented defensive breakdowns as the Pacers shot a season-best 54.4% (43 of 79), including 55.6% (10 of 18) in the final quarter. You have to make the coverages and schemes work, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Thats our whole mentality right there. If we get back to the point where permanent players decide they want to get into the ball and do what theyre supposed to do, then well have a better chance. The Pacers had six players score in double figures, including Aaron with 13 points and Justin with 12. TIP-INS Magic: The visitors didnt look like the NBAs worst 3-point shooting team, making 13 of 31 (41.9%) from beyond the arc. The last time these teams met, a 109-102 Pacers win on Nov. 10, the Magic hit a season-high 15 3-pointers. ... Orlando is averaging 13.1 turnovers per game, the second-best average in the league. Pacers: All-Star guard Victor Oladipo scrimmaged on Thursday, another positive step in his lengthy rehabilitation from surgery to repair a torn ACL that ended last season. No timetable has been announced for his return, but hes also worked out twice recently with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the G League. ... Point guard Malcolm Brogdon, sidelined for a third consecutive game with a sore back, joined the pregame shoot-around. MORE ON THE LINE The previous time these teams met, the Magic and Pacers made NBA history for fewest free throws combined at 11. They attempted 25 on Saturday.","401160869"
"ATLANTA --  Raptors coach Nick Nurse reminded his team at halftime to focus on getting stops and letting the defense spark the offense. ""That's the name of the game,"" guard Fred VanVleet said. ""We track how many consecutive stops we got. We came out of the half and had two stops, two 3s and just built from there."" Pascal Siakam scored 34 points and VanVleet had 25, helping the Toronto Raptors beat Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks 119-116 on Saturday night. Siakam, at 6-foot-9, 230 pounds, turned in another impressive performance, hurting the Hawks with mid-range jumpers and 3s. He has scored at least 30 in six games, one more than he had last season. Norman Powell added 20 points for defending champion Toronto in its third straight win. Young had 30 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in his second career triple-double, but Atlanta dropped its sixth straight game. The dynamic second-year guard hit two 3-pointers from 30-plus feet. ""It sucks that we lost, but if we play like, it's going to be tough to beat us,"" Young said. ""Obviously, we were down a couple of guys, but the way we played tonight, if we play like that, we can turn things around. We've got to do that every night."" Two nights after holding an opponent under 40 percent from the field for the sixth time this season, the defending NBA champion Raptors let Atlanta shoot nearly 53 percent. Hawks rookie De'Andre Hunter went 6 for 10 from 3-point range and finished with 26 points. VanVleet's 3 with 10:02 remaining gave Toronto its first lead since the final minute of the first quarter. The Raptors never trailed again. ""I thought we were thinking maybe it was going to be a little easier than you do on a normal NBA night, which is a mistake,"" Nurse said. ""I thought we played one-on-one early and didn't hustle back on D early and didn't execute our schemes very well. We were kind of chasing that, but saying that, sometimes you've got to find a way to win it, and give the guys all the credit in the world for that because it was a tough game. Siakam's layup at the 2:49 mark made it a 10-point advantage, but the Hawks pulled within four on Young's fast-break floater with 37.5 seconds to go. Siakam quickly answered with a dunk before Hunter hit a 3 with 24.8 seconds remaining. Hunter hit his sixth 3 to cut the lead to two, and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson made 1 of 2 foul shots. Young missed a 3 at the buzzer. Young hit a straightaway 3 from 36 feet to put the Hawks up 61-52 in the closing seconds before halftime. TIP-INS Raptors: F Serge Ibaka missed his seventh straight game with a right ankle sprain. Nurse said Ibaka is ""getting closer."" ... G Kyle Lowry missed his seventh straight game with a left thumb fracture. Nurse said Lowry could return next weekend. Lowry worked out on the floor before the game. Hawks: F Cam Reddish was sidelined by a left wrist sprain, missing his second straight game. Coach Lloyd Pierce said Reddish still can't grip the ball without pain. ... Young began the game as the only NBA player with top five averages in assists, points and steals. SERIES Toronto has won eight straight against the Hawks, including five in a row in Atlanta. BETTER SHOWING Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce convened a nearly hour-long team meeting following Friday's embarrassing loss at Detroit. He liked what he saw from his team a night later. ""We couldn't stop them, and that was really a difference, but I thought our guys competed even during that time for 48 minutes,"" Pierce said. ""Really just proud of the effort that everybody showed tonight.""","401160870"
"NEW YORK --  Gregg Popovichs longest losing streak as Spurs coach is over, though there was no celebration. Nor was there much despair while San Antonio lost the previous eight games. These guys, theyre too hardened and theyre all pros. Theyre grown men. Theyve got families and kids and that kind of stuff doesnt bother them, Popovich said. Nobody likes to lose a bunch of games, but its not going to debilitate them. Theyll still get their paychecks. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks 111-104 on Saturday night. The Spurs never trailed, led by as many as 28 and looked like the kind of team Popovich has usually had, not this one that has been one of the NBAs worst defensively. San Antonio was in control until deep into the second half, even while playing on the second night of back-to-back games to end a four-game road trip. I think everyone was definitely unhappy and frustrated, but youve got to change your own fate, Aldridge said. Youve got to find a way and tonight I thought we played better, played with more of a sense of urgency and got a win. DeMar DeRozan added 21 points and nine rebounds for the Spurs, who came in yielding 116.1 points per game but held the Knicks under 100 until the final 10 seconds of the game. Marcus Morris scored 20 points for the Knicks, who had played better in their last four games after a 2-9 start. I don't know how to explain it, coach David Fizdale said. We were in the mud and they were a desperate team. So, we got punched in the face and we dug a hole. The eight-game skid was the Spurs longest since early in the 1996-97 season under Bob Hill, when Popovich was the general manager. He replaced Hill later that season and the Spurs drafted Tim Duncan after it. Theyve since won five NBA titles during a record-tying 22 straight postseason appearances. Popovich shrugged off any interest in that or any other streak or achievement, saying all that mattered was working hard each night whether it was a win or a loss. Lately, it had been all losses, but there was never really a chance of one Saturday. The Spurs jumped to a 7-0 lead and it was never much of a game from there. They extended it to 26-9 later in the first quarter en route to a 32-16 lead after the period. There were noticeable boos when the Knicks took a timeout trailing 48-27, and they were a whole lot louder and angrier when the teams headed to the locker room with San Antonio holding a 68-43 halftime cushion. The Spurs shot 59% in the first half and held the Knicks to 4-for-16 shooting from 3-point range. Just a bad start, Knicks forward Julius Randle said. And you do that, I probably said it before, youve got to play perfect down the stretch. New York finally got something going in the third and cut it to 14, and finally got it to single digits when Morris four-point play made it 105-96 with 3:57 to play. RJ Barrett followed with a bucket, but that was as close as it got until the final basket. TIP-INS Spurs: G Dejounte Murray sat out to rest his right knee. ... Trey Lyles, who had fallen from the rotation and played just two minutes Friday in Philadelphia, came off the bench for 12 points in 15 minutes. ... San Antonio improved to 2-7 on the road. Knicks: Bobby Portis had 16 points, Randle added 14 and Barrett scored 13. ... Fizdale said second-round draft pick Ignas Brazdeikis will continue to spend time with the Knicks and their NBA G League affiliate. Brazdeikis had a 36-point game for Westchester this week. IT HASNT BEEN ALL BAD Before their struggles started, the Spurs got off to a good start. They won their first three, starting with an opening-night victory over the Knicks, and were 4-1. After we were 3-0 I thought that the trophy should have been given to us. Come on, its the Spurs, Popovich joked.","401160871"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Jimmy Butlers return to Philadelphia could be summed up in three letters: B-O-O. Josh Richardson scored 32 points and the 76ers led from start to finish in a 113-86 victory over Butler and the Miami Heat on Saturday night. Butler struggled to 11 points, missing nine of 13 field goal attempts. He sat out the entire fourth quarter. The star guard couldnt buy a basket -- and the notoriously tough Philly fans relished every moment. They booed him loudly during introductions and every time he touched the ball in the first half. They also cheered whenever he missed, and that was quite often. To tell you the truth, I legit didnt even pay attention, Butler said. I really dont pay attention to it. Joel Embiid added 23 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers (11-5), who won their fourth straight overall while improving to 7-0 at home. They played incredibly well, Butler said. Butler played 55 regular-season games for the Sixers last season, averaging 18.2 points after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last November. He helped Philadelphia beat Miami in the first round of the playoffs before the 76ers were eliminated in the second round by Toronto. He left Philadelphia in the offseason, inking a four-year, $142 million deal with the Heat in a sign-and-trade that brought Richardson to Philadelphia. Butler shot 2 of 8 in the first quarter, the Heat failed to connect on 17 of 22 tries and Philadelphia was up 28-13. The pattern continued as the 76ers took a 55-35 halftime lead thanks to Miamis 12-for-40 shooting in the first half, including 1 of 12 from behind the arc. Ben Simmons spent much of the night guarding Butler. When asked how he thought he fared, Philadelphias All-Star guard said, I think it went well, if you look at the boxscore. Philadelphias lead grew to 41 in the second half. Although Butler was embraced by the fan base during his stint in Philadelphia, everything wasnt rosy. He got heated during a film session last season with 76ers coach Brett Brown about the way he was being used in Browns offense, and there seems to be some lingering hard feelings. Brown was terse in his comments about Butler prior to Saturdays game. He had some great games for us, Brown said. We came close at the end. Sometimes things dont work out. Hes in a good place. Brown said he hasnt been in contact with Butler and answered a follow-up question about the Heat star by saying, I look forward to talking about the Miami Heat. Butler wasnt much more forthcoming about the parting. Thats something in the past, he said. Ill leave it there. Tyler Herro had 20 points to pace the Heat (11-4), who had won five in a row. RICHARDSONS RETURN Richardson, who played his first four seasons in Miami and averaged 16.6 points last season, made 11 of 15 shots and went 6 of 7 on 3-pointers. He had missed the previous two games with a hip injury. Definitely a fun game, Richardson said. ""I saw my first couple of shots go through and I just was staying aggressive."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami was playing the second game of a back-to-back after winning 116-108 at Chicago on Friday night.  Finished 6 for 24 from 3-point range. 76ers: It was the first of four matchups between the teams this season. Theyll next play Dec. 18 in Philadelphia.","401160872"
"CLEVELAND --  Riding a six-game losing streak, coming off a 42-point loss and playing without their leading scorer seemed to be a negative set of circumstances for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Those obstacles didn't matter Saturday night. Jordan Clarkson made all six of his 3-point attempts and scored 28 points to help Cleveland beat the Portland Trail Blazers 110-104. Clarkson's season high, which included 14 points in the fourth quarter, came a night after he was held scoreless in a 143-101 loss at Dallas. The Cavaliers completed a stretch of five games in seven days Saturday after the team arrived in Cleveland around 3 a.m. Larry Nance Jr. started in place of forward Kevin Love, who missed his second game this week because of a sore back. ""Obviously, last night wasn't necessarily a morale booster,"" said Nance, who had 11 points and 12 rebounds. ""To come back in and win this game, I'm really excited to see."" Cleveland coach John Beilein has remained upbeat despite his team's difficult stretch that dropped the Cavaliers' record to 5-11. ""I didn't see any fatigue,"" he said. ""I didn't see anything but effort to try and win the game. There are a lot of teams that have had tough schedules, that have had injuries and are rebuilding. We just have to stick together so we can be better than this."" Tristan Thompson scored 25 points and Cleveland held off a Trail Blazers' run in the fourth quarter. Damian Lillard returned after missing two games because of back spasms and scored 23 points, but Portland dropped to 5-12 and is 2-10 this month. The Trail Blazers have lost four straight and five of seven. Portland advanced to the Western Conference finals last season, but the Trail Blazers are struggling without center Jusuf Nurkic, who broke his leg in March and is still sidelined. ""I'm not a big worrier, but there is reason for concern on certain things,"" Lillard said. ""Because of the expectations for us, absolutely, it's disappointing."" Carmelo Anthony, playing his third game with Portland, scored 11 points in 35 minutes. Anthony was 5 of 15 from the field and missed all eight of his 3-point attempts. ""Physically I feel great,"" he said. ""Mentally I feel great. We've all been in situations like this before where we're trying to figure it out. There is still light at the end of the tunnel."" Cleveland led 100-88 midway through the fourth quarter, but Lillard scored the Blazers' next nine points, cutting the lead to 102-97. Baskets by Thompson and Nance halted Portland's rally. Lillard had 16 points in the fourth. CJ McCollum finished with 20 points. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: C Hassan Whiteside (sore right hip) missed his second straight game. Anthony Tolliver started in his place and scored nine points. ... Gary Trent Jr., who started Thursday, came off the bench with Lillard's return. ... G Rodney Hood, who played two seasons with the Cavaliers, including their 2018 NBA Finals team, scored 11 points. Cavaliers: Collin Sexton scored 19 points. ... Clarkson was 10 of 12 from the foul line. ... Cedi Osman had 12 rebounds. ...Thompson, a 61% free throw shooter, was 7 of 7 at the line. TOUGH GO Cleveland's tightly packed schedule, which also has three games next week, is one reason why Beilein is being cautious with Love, who also didn't play in New York on Sunday with the back issue. ""He could probably gut through it, but it's not advantageous for us or the team tonight or in the future if he tries to gut this through,"" Beilein said. GET TO THE POINT Portland coach Terry Stotts didn't go into a lot of detail when asked about his team's present state. ""Look at the record,"" he said. ""That kind of explains it."" Lillard's return should help and the four-time All-Star said his back wasn't an issue. ""I wasn't in pain,"" he said. ""I haven't played in two games, so I'm not going to come out and make every shot. I didn't play good enough to win.""","401160873"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers knew they would be tired playing their second game in as many nights. Experience made the difference against the young and rested Memphis Grizzlies. James scored on a driving layup with 1:30 left to put Los Angeles ahead to stay as the Lakers held off the Grizzlies 109-108 on Saturday night for their seventh straight victory. ""We just kept our composure,"" James said. ""That's what we do. We are a very resilient team."" The Grizzlies had a final chance with the ball and 1.3 seconds left. Jaren Jackson Jr. went sprawling trying to corral Kyle Anderson's inbounds pass. ""I was going to catch it and see if I had time to get a shot off or hit Ja (Morant), who would've probably been running full speed right next to me,"" Jackson said. ""Obviously, we didn't get to do all that."" James finished with 30 points. Anthony Davis added 22, Rajon Rondo had 14, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 12 and Dwight Howard had 10. Morant led Memphis with 26 points. Jae Crowder added 21, Jackson finished with 20, Dillon Brooks had 12 and Anderson scored 10, making rookie coach Taylor Jenkins very proud. ""If we can play like that every night, we have ourselves a chance,"" Jenkins said. The Lakers showed the effects of winning in Oklahoma City on Friday night. James made clear on social media he had trouble getting a nap with their hotel across the street from the FedExForum, where No. 16 Memphis beat Mississippi 87-86 earlier Saturday. ""We're lucky to get out of here with a win. Credit to the Grizzlies for coming out strong,"" said Lakers coach Frank Vogel, who used earplugs to help him rest. ""There young guys really came after us, in the first quarter in particular. Morant and Jackson are special talents and they put us in a hole."" LA never led in the first half and trailed by as much as 15 in the second quarter. The Lakers got going in the third and opened the fourth by jumping out to their biggest lead at 94-87. The Grizzlies led 105-100 on a tip-in by Brandon Clarke with 3:24 to go. The Lakers scored the next nine with James hitting his layup for the go-ahead bucket, and Davis followed by tipping in James' miss for a 109-105 lead with 53.5 seconds left. Morant's layup with 28 seconds left pulled Memphis within a point. James missed a jumper with the Grizzlies grabbing the rebound to set up the final try. The Grizzlies lost their third straight on a night they wore their Vancouver teal uniforms for the first time to celebrate their 25th NBA season along with a throwback court. Memphis led 35-25 after the first quarter and 63-55 at halftime. TIP-INS Lakers: Rondo played hours after the NBA fined him $35,000 for the foul that got him ejected from the Lakers' win over the Thunder for kicking guard Dennis Schroder in the groin area. Against Memphis, Rondo also had six assists and three rebounds. ... James snapped his seven-game streak with 10 or more assists, the longest in his career, with just four assists. It was the longest such streak for the Lakers since Magic Johnson had 10 straight in 1990-91. Grizzlies: They hit their first eight 3-pointers before Jackson missed with 10:38 left in the second. The team finished 14 of 30, the eighth time in nine games it has hit at least 10 3s. ... Outscored the Lakers 52-46 in the paint and outrebounded them 47-40. ... Memphis now is 4-1 in games decided by six or fewer points this season. MOVING ON UP James had six rebounds and now has 9,002 for his career. He also had two more steals, giving him 1,958 to move past Derek Harper for 14th all-time. He explained why he's been so successful taking the ball away. ""Anticipation, being in the right place at the right time, being healthy for the majority of my career so far, and then also being around some really good defensive coaches,"" James said. NO FOUL TRIPPING Davis set a Lakers franchise record by making 26 free throws on 27 attempts when these teams first met Oct. 29. Jackson recalled barely playing in that game because of foul trouble. This time, the No. 4 overall pick of the 2018 draft played 33 minutes, having picked up only two fouls. Davis was 5 of 6 at the line this time.","401160874"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo continued to provide the offense, and the Bucks defense eventually caught up. Antetokounmpo had 28 points and 10 rebounds for his 16th consecutive double-double to lead Milwaukee past the Detroit Pistons 104-90 on Saturday night for its seventh straight victory. ""There were different guys stepping up, making plays, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. I think the defense held them tonight. Theyre a little banged up on a back-to-back. Unfortunate for them, but kind to us. Wesley Mathews added 13 points and Eric Bledsoe had 11 for the Bucks, who improved their record to an Eastern Conference-best 13-3. Derrick Rose scored 20 points, Langston Galloway added 13 and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 17 rebounds for Detroit, which was without Blake Griffin. The star forward, who has played in just four games this season, was inactive for injury recovery after playing 32 minutes in a 128-103 victory over Atlanta on Friday in the first game of the back-to-back. It doesnt change my approach. Coming into the game, my mindset is to win, Antetokounmpo said. Obviously, when you dont have a guy like Blake thats a really great player, and (has) a lot of experience playing, now youve got to figure out who youre guarding and whose going to go against you. Antetokounmpo is the first player to open the season with 16 double-doubles in a row since Moses Malone did it for the Houston Rockets in 1981. Antetokounmpo and George Hill hit consecutive 3-pointers to fuel a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter and put Milwaukee in front 89-69. Detroit missed its first eight shots of the period before Langston Galloway finally hit a 3 with 5:47 remaining. We had some ill-advised shots and didn't execute the way we should have, Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. In those moments youve got to have a clear understanding of what you are trying to do. We didn't do that. The Bucks used a 15-2 run midway through the third quarter to build a 71-54 lead. Detroit whittled it to 77-69 entering the final period. Casey said he thought fatigue played a factor, especially down the stretch. The Pistons shot 60% in the victory over Atlanta, but dipped to 41% against the Bucks. Shooting is the first part you saw, Casey said. The same shots we were getting last night were all short. That is a back-to-back, but that is the whole NBA. Hills 3-pointer at the buzzer put the Bucks up 54-47 at halftime. Milwaukee shot 51% in the first half, making 21 of 41 shots, but Detroit stayed close thanks to nine second-chance points. A lot of this is such a two-way sport; offense takes care of the defense, defense takes care of the offense, said Bucks guard Wesley Matthews. We start taking care of the ball a little bit better, we had a lot of turnovers on our end, three I think, at least three myself, and it kind of puts the defense in a tough spot. But we responded, we compete and were always going to compete. TIP-INS Detroit has four players who were with the Bucks last season: Tim Frazier, Thon Maker, Tony Snell and Christian Wood. As I went through their depth chart I was like, wow, dont remember having four from a previous team, previous season and then playing them, Budenholzer said.","401160875"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Even without Rudy Gobert, the usually defensive-minded Utah Jazz blitzed the New Orleans Pelicans with some high-octane offense. Mitchell made six 3-pointers and scored a season-high 37 points as Utah outlasted the Pelicans 128-120 on Saturday night. Mitchell sparked the Jazz to a quick start after they held off the depleted Golden State Warriors the night before. ""We needed to come out with a hot start, as you get a little fatigued in the second half of a back-to-back,"" said Mitchell, who had 14 points in the first five minutes as Utah (11-5) jumped out to a 28-9 lead. Bojan Bogdanovic added 28 points to help the Jazz overcome the absence of Gobert, who was a late scratch with a sprained ankle. ""This was our best game offensively. Every player was playing with high confidence. We started the game so well,"" Bogdanovic said. Mitchell knew the Jazz needed to score as much as they could while they had their legs. ""They shot the ball well. We weren't into them at all, they didn't feel us defensively,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry lamented. Though the Jazz led the entire way, they had to quell a late comeback from the Pelicans, who had won three in a row and scored 66 points in the second half. Brandon Ingram had 33 points and Jrue Holiday scored 12 of his 28 in the fourth quarter. JJ Redick added 20 points for New Orleans (6-10). ""The second half, we picked up the energy, got into the ball and made it hard for them to either get to the basket or pass off for 3s. We did what we were supposed to do, what we wanted to do from the beginning of the game,"" Holiday said. Mike Conley, who has been decidedly inconsistent during his first season in Utah, threw an alley-oop to Jeff Green and then hit a 3-pointer to boost Utah to a 122-110 lead with 2:15 left. Conley was 1 for 8 to that point but looked off Mitchell and calmly hit the shot. ""They were big plays and I needed to get my legs under me after chasing JJ Redick around. But the fourth quarter is winning time and both those plays were big for us and came comfortable for me,"" Conley said. The Pelicans made one more run as Ingram hit a 3 with 37.9 seconds remaining to make it 124-120. But then Bogdanovic and Green each made two free throws to clinch it. Green had 15 points and Tony Bradley added 14 points and nine rebounds as they shared the center position in Gobert's absence. Lonzo Ball hit a 3 to cap a 15-5 run and bring the Pelicans to 86-78 with 4:36 left in the third quarter. The Jazz then built back a double-digit lead a couple of times until Ingram made a 3-pointer with 4:16 remaining to cut Utah's advantage to 113-106. Ball was on a minutes restriction in his second game back from a groin injury but had 13 points on 5-for-15 shooting in 25 minutes. Gobert played most of Friday's win over Golden State after he turned his ankle in the first quarter. He had seven blocks in that game but sat out against the Pelicans after pregame warmups determined he was too sore. Bolstered by two quick 3s by Bogdanovic and Mitchell, the Jazz scored the first 14 points of the game. ""It wasn't anything premediatated, it was just me starting to feel it and then to just keep going,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell had 23 points and Bogdanovic poured in 20 in the first half as the Jazz led 74-54 at the break. Utah posted season bests for points in a half and a game. BRADLEY COMES UP BIG Bradley's 14 points and nine rebounds were both just one off his career highs and his teammates relished his time in the spotlight. Gobert joined reporters in asking him questions in the locker room, and others shouted his praises as he was interviewed. ""All I was thinking was to play hard, rebound and defend as best I can,"" Bradley said. His hustle turned into opportunities as he ran the floor and found himself with the ball at the rim on multiple plays. He even made a Gobert-esque block that brought a loud ovation in the fourth quarter. Before the game, Green told the young center to play hard and not overthink it or replay mistakes. ""He did that, and much more,"" Green said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Derrick Favors, who played in Utah for eight seasons, didn't make the trip because of back spasms. . The Pelicans made all 17 of their free throws until Redick missed one with 1:59 to play. They finished 19 for 20. . For the first time this season, Redick was the team's leading rebounder with seven. Jazz: Mitchell got a technical for staring down Nicolo Melli after dunking over him in the second quarter. ... A coach's challenge was successful in the fourth quarter when Ingram kicked out his leg on a 3-pointer and struck Joe Ingles, who originally was whistled for a foul. . The Jazz shot 51% from the field and 42% from 3-point range while outrebounding the Pelicans 49-38.","401160876"
"When asked about the Mavericks' improved defense, Luka Doncic makes a playful joke about Dirk Nowitzki's defense. (0:25) HOUSTON --  Dallas coach Rick Carlisle didnt want his team to get overexcited about its convincing victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday. He was, however, quick to note the importance of the victory. This is a big win. There's no question about that, Carlisle said. You come in here, this is a big-time place to play and you're playing against great players. So our guys deserve credit but this is a process and its day by day and week by week and we've got to continue to go for daily improvement. Luka Doncic scored 41 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added a season-high 31 and the Mavericks never trailed in the 137-123 romp. The Mavericks scored 45 points in the first quarter and were up 78-60 at halftime. Hardaway had 19 in the half, Doncic 17 and Kristaps Porzingis 15. That first quarter killed us, Houstons P.J. Tucker said. James Harden was asked what Houston did wrong defensively. Everything, he said. We allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do from the beginning of the game and when you give a team like that comfort ... they gain confidence. And that's what they did. The Mavericks has won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row. Dallas knew that the Rockets had a quick turnaround after playing a game in Los Angeles on Friday night and focused on getting off to a good start. It was important, Hardaway said. We wanted to make sure we came out of the gate with some firepower, some energy. The Mavericks got a dunk from Dwight Powell to push the lead to 11 early in the fourth quarter. Houston used a 6-0 run after that shot to get to 110-105 with 9 minutes to go. Doncic ended the run with a jump shot, but Russell Westbrook added a basket seconds later to cut it to five again. Dallas was still up by 5 later in the quarter before scoring the next five points, with a dunk from Hardaway, to make it 119-109 midway through period, and Houston didn't get close again. James Harden had 32 points for Houston but was just 2 of 15 on 3-pointers in a game where the Rockets made 10 of 44 3-point attempts. The Mavericks had extended the lead to 16 later in the fourth when Doncic scored six points in a row, capped by a 3-pointer to make it 132-113 with about 3 1/2 minutes to go. Dallas led by 20 in the third quarter before Houston scored the next seven points, with a 3-pointer from Tucker, to get to 89-76 midway through the period. The Mavericks were up by 16 later in the third after two free throws by Dorian Finney-Smith before Tucker made consecutive baskets to cut the lead to 103-91. Harden added two free throws, but Hardaway made a jump shot seconds later to make it 105-93. Westbrook made a basket to wrap up the third quarter and cut the lead to 10 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Mavericks: Seth Curry was back after sitting out the last game because of an illness. ... Porzingis finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds. ... Doncic had 10 assists and six rebounds. ... Doncic and Hardaway made five 3-pointers each. Rockets: House returned after missing the last game with a sore left shoulder. ... Clint Capela had 21 points and 22 rebounds. ... Westbrook scored 27 points with six assists and five rebounds. HARDAWAYS HEALTH Hardaway has been an important player for the Mavericks this season after undergoing surgery on his left leg because of a stress fracture in April. My leg feels amazing, Hardaway said. I'm getting back to my old self and just trying to make the most out of the opportunity right now. Sunday was his third straight game with at least 16 points after he had just one such performance in his first 13 games this season. THEY SAID IT Houston coach Mike DAntoni on the teams start Sunday: They punched us good and we fall all the way back. A lot of time when you do that, you run out of gas.","401160877"
"NEW YORK -- Kyrie Irving will miss at least two more games, sitting out trips to his old homes in Cleveland and Boston. The way Spencer Dinwiddie is playing, it might not matter to the Brooklyn Nets. ""Just, difference-maker right now,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Dinwiddie scored 30 points in another strong start in place of the injured point guard and the Nets beat the New York Knicks 103-101 on Sunday for their season-high third straight victory. Irving continues to rest an injured right shoulder, and Dinwiddie is making sure the Nets get by without him, scoring 20 or more points in a career-best five straight games after stepping into the starting lineup. He was 13 of 14 from the foul line, where the Nets had a whopping 27-9 advantage in makes. Jarrett Allen had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, and Taurean Prince had 14 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists. Joe Harris scored 13 points, with four coming after the Knicks had cut it to one with 1:20 left. Marcus Morris scored 26 points for the Knicks, who lost their third straight. They played without rookie RJ Barrett. He was scratched after feeling sick before the game. The Nets are missing their starting backcourt, with Caris LeVert out after right thumb surgery. But they have won four of five to even their record at 8-8. ""We don't have some of our better players on the court, but we're still finding a way to win,"" Allen said. The biggest reason has been the play of Dinwiddie, who could go back to the bench as soon as Friday if Irving is cleared to return. Or, perhaps Atkinson could choose to start them together until LeVert is recovered. ""I'm not the coach, I don't make those decisions,"" Dinwiddie said. ""If that's the new role, then that's what I'll do, and if it's not, then it's not."" The Nets opened a 29-15 lead but struggled when Dinwiddie and Allen went to the bench and let the Knicks close the gap to 52-46 by halftime. New York cut it to one after back-to-back 3s by Morris and another by Wayne Ellington, but Harris scored on a drive and later added a pair of free throws. The Knicks had a much stronger effort than a night earlier, when they never led in a home loss to San Antonio. But they fell to 4-13 ahead of a tough five-game stretch against Toronto, Philadelphia, Boston, Milwaukee and Denver. ""I embrace the challenge,"" coach David Fizdale said. ""I don't feel like we need to be looking at that like that's impossible. We're going to take it a game at a time and continue to try to give ourselves a chance to win every night."" TIP-INS Nets: Atkinson said Irving wouldn't travel with the team to Cleveland on Monday but wasn't sure yet about Wednesday to Boston. ... It was the most points Dinwiddie has scored in 12 games against the Knicks. Knicks: Mitchell Robinson was called for a sixth foul with 4:54 left, but Fizdale challenged the call and it was overturned, allowing Robinson to stay on the floor. Not for long: He then picked up the sixth 42 seconds later and was given a technical foul after saying something to a referee on his way off the floor. ... Morris has scored 20 or more in four straight and six of his past seven games. KNOX'S CHANCE Kevin Knox II had five points starting in place of Barrett. He not only hadn't started this season, but his minutes off the bench had been dwindling. He had been limited to 10 or fewer in the past two games, with Fizdale seeking a more consistent defensive effort from the 2018 lottery pick. So he was hoping to make the most of his opportunity Sunday but picked up his fourth foul less than four minutes into the second half. ""Like I say you've got to be ready when your name gets called,"" Knox said. ""My dad used to always tell me growing up: You're an ankle sprain away from that time."" MORE NOISE The sound around the Nets has changed -- on and off the court -- since the recent signing of Iman Shumpert, who began his career with the Knicks, won a title with Cleveland and has done some rap music. ""I just see Theo [Pinson], DeAndre [Jordan], the communication is better because he talks a ton and his aggressiveness, he's pushing the other guys,"" Atkinson said. ""And then our music has definitely improved in the locker room. We've taken a step up in our music selection. Obviously, he's pretty sophisticated there.""","401160878"
"WASHINGTON --  Sacramento Kings coach Luke Walton hoped to avoid a track meet against the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. Defense made it happen in the second half. Harrison Barnes matched his season high with 26 points on 7-of-8 shooting, Bojan Bogdanovic had 21 points to help the Kings to a 113-106 victory. Sacramento held Washington -- the NBAs second-ranked offense -- to 49 points after the break and 21 in the fourth quarter. The challenge to the group at halftime was lets see if we cant continue to score but actually get some stops, said Walton, whose team entered halftime tied at 57. Lets try to put our will on this game. I think our guys did a really nice job in the second half of playing defense. Buddy Hield added 18 points, including a late 3-pointer that put Sacramentos lead at multiple possessions for good, and Richaun Holmes had 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Kings -- who are without injured regulars Marvin Bagley III (thumb) and DAaron Fox (ankle) -- won for the seventh time in 10 games to improve to 7-8 while forcing 17 turnovers and holding the Wizards to 46% shooting. We just wanted to come out and guard and be there for each other, Holmes said, and I think we did a pretty good job tonight. Bradley Beal led Washington with 20 points, ending his string of 30 or more at a career-best five games. Isaiah Thomas added 17, and Moritz Wagner had 12 points and 11 rebounds. The ball just didnt go in, Beal said about Washingtons offense, which is averaging a fraction above 119 points and 48% from the floor. It was just one of those nights for us. On nights like tonight, weve got to defend, and thats kind of been our Achilles' heel. Tied at the half, the Kings built their lead to nine on a 17-8 third-quarter run. Bogdanovic scored eight points in the stretch, including an early 3-pointer, a driving reverse layup and then a free throw that stretched it to 88-79 with 1:41 left in the quarter. The Kings kept the lead at multiple baskets until Thomas baseline 3-pointer cut it to 100-97 with 4:11 left. Hield immediately answered with a 3-pointer. The Wizards thought they had cut it to two points inside of 2 minutes, only to learn that Thomas Bryants apparent putback shortly after Hields 3 had been overruled for a shot clock violation following video review. We are getting better at our rotations and we are getting better on the ball, said Cory Joseph, who guarded Beal most of the evening. We are getting better as a whole defensively, and I think that we just have to continue to climb because we have the personnel to do that. TIP INS: Kings: Went 2 of 13 from 3-point range in the first half and finished 11 of 31  G Cory Joseph (heel) started despite being limited to 23 minutes in Fridays loss at Brooklyn ... Bogdanovic (hamstring tightness) was a game-time decision after missing Friday. Wizards: Beals 30-point streak was the fourth-longest in franchise history. With another game, he wouldve tied Bernard King, who scored 30-plus in six straight from Nov. 3 to Nov. 16 of 1990. ... Wagners double-double was the second of his career. The second-year pros first came on Nov. 15 in a 137-116 win at Minnesota. WHO WON THE PAINT? While the Wizards outscored the Kings 52-46 inside the paint, Sacramento shot considerably better there (23 of 34) and also earned 28 free throws, 16 more than Washington. QUOTABLE Were not the most talented team, so we have to do everything the other teams dont do at a high level. Weve got to defend. Weve got to get the 50-50 balls. Weve got to make shots. We have no room for error, really, if we want to be good and we want to win games. -- Thomas, who is 14 games into his first season with the Wizards.","401160879"
"DENVER --  Will Barton wasn't happy with his energy in the first half, so he pledged to pick it up in the third quarter. He delivered on his promise and led the Denver Nuggets to their fifth straight victory. Barton scored 12 of his 22 points in a momentum-turning third quarter, Paul Millsap finished with 23 points in Denver's 116-104 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. Jamal Murray had 22 points, and Nikola Jokic had just eight points, but grabbed 13 rebounds to help the Nuggets win their ninth in the last 10 games. It took a shutdown second half against a tired team, led by Barton's energy. ""I felt like in the first half my energy wasn't there and I wasn't flying around on defense good enough so I told them I'm going to bring it the third quarter,"" Barton said. Denver held Phoenix guard Devin Booker to a season-low 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Booker came in averaging 26.2 points in November but showed fatigue in the Suns' fifth game in seven days. ""I'm glad we got it out of the way,"" Booker said. ""Two back-to-backs in one week, I haven't heard of that before, but it's what the schedule presented to us."" Cheick Diallo led Phoenix with a career-high 22 points and Dario Saric had a career-high 17 rebounds to go with 18 points. Booker had just seven points into the fourth quarter, but the Suns led most of the game until the Nuggets rallied. Phoenix was again without center Aron Baynes and guard Ricky Rubio, and the lack of depth showed in the third when the team combined for 7-of-22 shooting. Booker missed all four of his attempts. ""Just missing shots,"" Booker said. ""I'm sure I'll be fine and I know getting Ricky and Aron back will help out to that."" Denver used a 10-2 run late in the third quarter to take its first lead since the first quarter. Barton had 12 points in the period and Millsap seven before picking up his fourth foul. ""He was getting offensive rebounds, putbacks, he was locking up,"" center Mason Plumleaid of Barton. ""He changed the game and he told us he was going to."" The Nuggets led 88-87 early in the fourth, then used a 13-4 run to take a 101-91 lead. Malik Beasley, who had been out of the rotation, hit a 3-pointer with 5:11 remaining to make it 104-93. Booker hit his only 3-pointer of the night to pull Phoenix within eight, but Denver went on a 9-2 run to put it out of reach. TIP-INS Suns: Rubio has missed three of the last four games with back spasms and played only 16 minutes in the other game. ... Baynes has missed four straight games with a right hip flexor strain. ... Elie Okobo scored a season-high 14 points. He had 11 in the first half. Nuggets: Plumlee shook off a headache earlier in the day to score 14 points and Monte Morris added 10 off the bench. ... C Bol Bol was recalled from Windy City of the G League. Bol, the team's first-round pick out of Oregon in June, played four games for the Bulls, averaging 11.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 blocks in 16.9 minutes per game. SHORT-TIMER Suns coach Monty Williams played 456 games over 10 NBA seasons, including a short stint with Denver. The Nuggets signed Williams to a free-agent contract on Jan. 23, 1999, and he got into one game for six minutes before being cut 20 days after signing with Denver. ""I wasn't here long enough to have a memory,"" Williams said Sunday. ""It wasn't anything worth talking about. I messed my ankle up real bad and tore a couple of ligaments and played on it. Should have been in today's environment; they would have let me sit out the whole year."" Williams is in the stats book with the Nuggets. He hit one free throw and missed both of his shot attempts.","401160880"
"LOS ANGELES --  Doc Rivers has seen the Los Angeles Clippers roster undergo many changes over the past 15 months. Montrezl Harrell has remained one of the few constants. Harrell showed again on Sunday night that he shouldn't be overlooked despite the additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The fifth-year forward tied a career high with 34 points as the Clippers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 134-109 for their fifth straight win. `They are starting to see Montrez is good. He can score a lot of different ways and it seems like each year he is adding more to his game,"" Rivers said. ""He went left a couple times tonight when the scouting report is to not have him go right."" It is the fifth 30-point game of Harrell's career and the second time he has scored 34 this season (the other was Nov. 6 against Milwaukee). He was 13 of 18 from the field and grabbed 12 rebounds as he led the Clippers in scoring for the fourth time this season. Leonard scored 24 points, Lou Williams added 19 and Paul George had 18 for the Clippers, who have won 11 of 12 at home. ""It is great that we can still be able to run and collect wins while we are still adjusting,"" Harrell said. ""We're a deep team and anyone can have a big night."" Brandon Ingram, one of three Lakers players involved in the Anthony Davis trade, led New Orleans with 24 points and eight rebounds in his first game back at Staples Center. Jrue Holiday scored 18 and E'Twaun Moore had 17. ""There have been a couple times where we've been down and try to fight back and it has been a little too hard with the deficits. I feel like that has been the standard so far,"" Holliday said. JJ Redick and Holiday hit 3-pointers to give the Pelicans a 10-6 lead three minutes into the game before the Clippers took control with a 15-4 run. George keyed the run with a pair of 3s and Leonard added five. Los Angeles led 40-27 and then increased it to 62-37 on George's 3 with 5:55 remaining in the first half. ""The slow starts are killing us. You can't give up 40 in a quarter unless you are going to score 45, and we weren't going to score 45 against that team,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. The Clippers went into halftime with a 72-56 advantage before New Orleans cut the lead in half with an 11-3 run to start the third quarter. Jaxson Hayes' layup drew the Pelicans to 86-80 with 4:53 remaining in the quarter but that would be as close as they got as Los Angeles countered with an 11-2 run, which included Harrell scoring the last six points. ""They cut it to six and we got it right back up. I thought our guys got back to playing,"" Rivers said. LONG DISTANCE CLIPS In the three games that Leonard and George have played together, the Clippers are averaging 15.3 3-pointers per game, which is five more than the first 14 games. Los Angeles had 16 3-pointers on Sunday with eight players hitting from beyond the arc. George led the way with six 3s. ""Everyone is trapping on us but we are moving the ball and getting great looks. They're wide open, so we better take them,"" Rivers said.

"CLEVELAND --  Spencer Dinwiddie keeps coming through in the clutch for the Brooklyn Nets. Dinwiddie's fadeaway jumper with 1.9 seconds remaining gave Brooklyn its fourth straight victory, 108-106 over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. Dinwiddie scored 23 points on the day he was voted Eastern Conference player of the week. The Nets are 5-1 without leading scorer Kyrie Irving, who missed his sixth straight game with a sore shoulder. Dinwiddie is averaging 24.6 points in Irving's absence. ""Spencer Dinwiddie just put on a clinic on how to keep your team under control and make the right play,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. Following a shot clock violation and the score tied 106-all, the Nets called timeout with 6.2 seconds left. Dinwiddie, after taking the inbounds pass from Joe Harris, dribbled around Cedi Osman to the right of the key and hit the tiebreaking shot from 18 feet. Dinwiddie improvised after taking the pass and was hoping center Jarrett Allen would bail him out if he missed. ""I was trying to get a shot up in the first three seconds, so Jarrett had a chance to tip it in,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Cedi was kind of sliding right, so I took a couple dribbles and put it up."" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson gave Dinwiddie credit for the result. ""It was not a great play (drawn up), but a great individual play by Spencer,"" he said. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love was out for the second straight game because of a sore back. Jarrett Allen had 22 points and a season-high 21 rebounds, going 9 of 10 from the field and adding a key block when he swatted Jordan Clarkson's shot out of bounds with eight seconds left and the game tied. ""I should have kept in inbounds, but I got a little excited,"" Allen said. ""I knew I had to be a little bit careful and not foul."" Cleveland erased a 106-97 deficit with just over 2 minutes left and cut the lead to one on Clarkson's 3-pointer. Collin Sexton tied the game with a free throw, but missed the second shot with 21 seconds to play. ""It felt good,"" Sexton said. ""It went in and out. I've just got to make it the next time. I know I should have made it."" Cleveland maintained possession, but Allen blocked Clarkson's shot and the Cavaliers followed with their shot clock violation. Clarkson scored 23 points while Larry Nance Jr. had 20 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland, which has lost seven of eight. Brooklyn didn't shoot a free throw in the first half but was 9 of 11 at the line in the third quarter. The Nets didn't get to the line in the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Allen made two free throws with 8:19 remaining in the third quarter. ... G Iman Shumpert, signed by Brooklyn two weeks ago, was also a member of the Cavaliers' championship team. He hit a 3-pointer and played 18 minutes. Cavaliers: Love, who was sidelined Saturday, had been listed as questionable and the team announced he wasn't playing after he went through pregame warmups. ... Nance started in Love's place for the second straight game. NOT IN TOWN Irving, a star on the Cavaliers' championship team in 2016, has played in Cleveland one time since being traded to Boston prior to the 2017-18 season, coming in that season's opener. He missed both of the Celtics' appearances last season. Irving will also miss Wednesday's game in Boston, the Nets' first trip there this season. He was injured in a 119-114 loss at Utah on Nov. 12 and played through the injury two nights later in Denver. DOMINATING IN THE MIDDLE Allen recorded the second 20-point/20-rebound game of his career. ""Jarrett Allen is playing fantastic,"" Atkinson said. ""He's one of the best rim protectors in the league and came up with another big play.""","401160882"
"DETROIT --  Dwane Casey had an easy time identifying when and how his team won this game. ""I think our defense was exceptional in the second half,"" the Detroit coach said. Casey shouldn't get much argument from the Orlando Magic about that. They were held to 15 points in the third quarter and 33 in the second half of Detroit's 103-88 win Monday night. Luke Kennard scored 20 points and Blake Griffin added 17 to lead the Pistons past the short-handed Magic. Orlando was playing a second straight game without Nikola Vucevic, out with a right ankle sprain. The Magic are now 0-7 on the road this season. ""They're good defensively and they were aggressive with their coverages,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""I thought in the first half we did a good job; the second half we just got away from it. ... The ball has got to move."" Detroit went on an 11-0 run near the end of the third and led 78-70 at the start of the fourth. Orlando never really threatened after that. The Magic shot just 39% from the field and 8 of 25 from 3-point range. The Pistons entered the day shooting 39.2% from beyond the arc, the second-best mark in the NBA. They were a bit below that clip Monday, going 14 of 38, but Langston Galloway and Svi Mykhailiuk made four 3-pointers each, and Kennard added three. ""When people play basketball and people play games, they get more adjusted to the game,"" Mykhailiuk said. ""When coach trusts you, it relaxes you and gives you more freedom on the court."" Terrence Ross led Orlando with 19 points and Evan Fournier added 17. Andre Drummond had seven points and 18 rebounds for Detroit. The Magic led by 11 early in the second quarter, but Detroit quickly erased that deficit, and Orlando led 55-53 at halftime. ""If we play the right way and lose it's one thing, but that's not what we did,"" Clifford said. ""In this league, you pay the price."" OVERTURNED Detroit won a coach's challenge in the fourth quarter when a foul on Mykhailiuk was changed to an offensive foul on Markelle Fultz. Casey said he thinks the spirit of the replay system is good, although there might be room for some tweaks. ""It's tough,"" Casey said. ""When you only have one, and it takes a timeout, and there's so many plays you want to use it on."" INJURIES The Pistons were without point guard Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction), as well as Tony Snell (left hip strain). In addition to Vucevic, Orlando was missing forward Aaron Gordon (right ankle contusion) and guard Michael Carter-Williams (left hip irritation).

TIP-INS Magic: Isaac had 10 points, six rebounds and four blocks. ... Orlando shot 5 of 21 from the field in the third quarter and 6 of 18 in the fourth. Pistons: Mykhailiuk equaled a career high with 12 points. ... Galloway scored 12 points of his own for his 13th straight game in double figures.","401160883"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  T.J. Warren's aggressive approach led the Indiana Pacers to their biggest offensive night of the season. Warren scored 26 points on 11-of-15 shooting, and the Pacers beat the Memphis Grizzlies 126-114 on Monday night. ""I just want to stay aggressive when I'm out there,"" Warren said. ""We have a lot of potential. We're clicking right now, so we just have to keep it up and get ready for the next one."" Jeremy Lamb had 19 points and Aaron Holiday added 16 points off the bench for the Pacers (10-6), who have won three straight and seven of nine games. Indiana's 126 points were a season-best. The Pacers shot 54.3% from the field and 54.5% on 3-pointers. Their 18 3s were also a season high and one shy of the franchise record. ""I thought we did a good job of executing, getting out and pushing the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We had 29 assists, so we had good ball movement. But we were trading baskets. We gave up 62 points in the paint and that's way too many points."" Jared Jackson Jr. scored a season-high 28 points -- including a career-high six 3-pointers -- Ja Morant had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke scored 17 points on 8-of-9 shooting for the Grizzlies (5-11), who have lost four straight. ""The biggest takeaway is that we didn't come in with an urgency to start the game,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We started selling the game a little bit, but a little too late for us when we started settling in."" The Pacers led by as much as 29 after T.J. McConnell scored and Holiday made back-to-back 3-pointers, including one to give Indiana a 112-83 lead with 10:45 remaining. Jackson hit two 3s, Morant twice made layups and Solomon Hill scored in a 12-0 spurt in the fourth quarter by the Grizzlies, but Memphis couldn't put enough together to overcome such a big deficit. The Pacers took a 16-point lead in the first half after a 12-2 run that ended with a free throw by Domantas Sabonis that made it 65-49 with 2:02 to play in the second quarter. Morant made a layup and Jae Crowder a 3-pointer to close out the half. The Pacers led 67-56 at halftime. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Clarke was 5 for 5 from the field with 11 points in the first quarter. . C Jonas Valanciunas finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. . Memphis shot 47.4% from the field, including 13 of 29 on 3-pointers. Pacers: G Malcolm Brogdon had 14 points, six rebounds and eight assists. . Sabonis had 13 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. . F JaKarr Sampson was inactive for a second straight game with a sore back. STARTING FIVE A number of injuries have left the Pacers short-handed many times this season, forcing McMillan to use seven different lineups so far. Against the Grizzlies, Indiana used its opening night starting five for just the third time and is now 2-1 using that combination. BIG BLOCKING Myles Turner, who finished with seven points and four rebounds, blocked a season-high five shots -- the most by a Pacers player in a single game this season.","401160884"
"ATLANTA --  Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders moved Jeff Teague out of the starting lineup to give the reserves more scoring punch. The Timberwolves reserves responded, scoring 46 points in a 125-113 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. The idea to move Teague to the bench wasn't that of Saunders alone. He said he and the former Hawks guard have been talking about it for some time. ""We talked earlier. It's more about who ends games, too,"" Saunders said. ""Jeff Teague is a professional and he's a man. It came about with him and I having a casual conversation. He said, `I'm good with whatever role you want me in.' He saw and agreed that there was a need in that second unit."" Teague had eight points and eight assists. Reserves Keita Bates-Diop and Gorgui Dieng each scored 13. ""Gorgui was amazing. ... When he's given the opportunity, he goes out and makes magic happen,"" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who scored 28 points and had 13 rebounds for Minnesota. ""Jeff (Teague) is just a pro. He's an amazing guy to have in the locker room. We're in this to win. We're not about individual accolades."" Andrew Wiggins added 25 points and the Minnesota Timberwolves rode three big offensive quarters. Trae Young scored 37 points for the Hawks, who outscored the Timberwolves 34-16 in the second quarter. But Minnesota had 38 points in the first quarter, 39 in the third and 32 in the fourth against one of the NBA's weakest defensive teams and snapped a two-game skid. Jabari Parker pitched in 22 points for the Hawks and rookie center Bruno Fernando scored a career-high 13. The Timberwolves shot 63.6% in the first quarter and opened a 40-30 lead early in the second, but missed 15-of-19 shots over the rest of the period. Young scored 14 points in the quarter while Hawks attacked the basket frequently and had 21 points and seven assists -- several on alley-oop lob passes -- by halftime, leading Atlanta to a 64-54 lead. Towns heated up after halftime to pull the Timberwolves back into the game. In the third quarter alone, he had 15 points, eight rebounds and three assists to help Minnesota take a 93-90 lead to the fourth quarter. Other than in that second quarter, the youngish Atlanta squad frequently busted defensive assignments, such as when they were double-teaming Anthony in the third quarter. ""We had a lot of undisciplined play,"" said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce. ""We were leaving strong-side shooters (open), we were double-teaming in the post when we weren't in that coverage. It was the lack of discipline on a lot of our defensive possessions that got us in trouble . . . ""Blitzing KAT in the second half wasn't the plan and because there were some cross matches, guys just overacted to the situation and we got caught with him hitting the cutter a couple times . . . At this stage, every game has a different personality."" TIP-INS TIMBERWOLVES: Rookie Jarrett Culver started at guard rather than former Hawk Jeff Teague. They played together at times. ... Frequent starter Noah Vonleh did play, and was not listed on the pregame injury report. ... Guard Shabazz Napier (hamstring) and forward Jake Layman (toe sprain) remain sidelined. HAWKS: Guard Cam Reddish returned after missing two games with a sprained left wrist and started to bump DeAndre' Bembry back to the bench. They've been tag-teaming in place of Kevin Huerter, who remains sidelined with a sprained rotator cuff in his left shoulder. The rookie from Duke continues to struggle to find his shot. Reddish scored seven points on 2-of-10 shooting, one of them a fast-break alley-oop dunk off a pass from Young. ... Parker has scored at least 10 points in 16-of-17 games.

"BOSTON --  Marcus Smart had the ball bounce right for him and the Boston Celtics this time. Jaylen Brown scored 24 points, Jayson Tatum had 20 and the Celtics held off the Sacramento Kings 103-102 despite a career-high 41 points from Buddy Hield on Monday night. Smart had 17 points, including two key baskets, and seven assists. Enes Kanter added 13 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who had lost the final two games of a 2/3 trip to the West. Smart sandwiched his baskets around a 3-pointer by Bogdan Bogdanovic, the second a spinning shot with 31 seconds to go that pushed the Celtics ahead 103-102. The first bounced off the front of the rim and fell in -- a similar look to one that went the other way as time expired when the teams met in Sacramento. ""Yeah, it was a good feeling,"" he said, smiling, of the friendly roll. ""When I shot it, I saw it on the front of the rim again and I was like: `Not again. I've got to get it this time.' It felt good to see the ball finally go in. It's just ironic it happened to bounce like that again this time."" In the team's first meeting on Nov. 17 -- a 100-99 Kings victory that snapped Boston's 10-game winning streak -- Smart drove and had his shot roll off the front as time expired. Harrison Barnes added 20 points for the Kings, who had won seven of 10. Hield was 15 of 26 from the floor and went 11 for 21 on 3-point attempts. ""They're (defenders) locked into Buddy, and to win in this league it takes a team. So we're going to keep looking for him, but we need everyone to step up and make plays, and I thought we did it tonight,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""We didn't score the last one, but we gave ourselves a chance."" Boston picked up the victory despite missing three starters. Kemba Walker was sidelined with a neck strain after a scary collision with a teammate last week. Gordon Hayward has a fractured hand and Daniel Theis was sick. ""It's one game. We've just got to find ways to win. We'll welcome Kemba back when he's healthy. Let him rest up,"" Brown said. ""We're just holding it down for him and Gordon until they make their return. It's great to find ways to win, even with injuries. We've got to continue to do that, and I'm looking forward to it."" Hield hit his 11th 3-pointer to cut Sacramento's deficit to 97-96. Brown countered with a short jumper in the lane before Cory Joseph tied it with a 3 in front of Boston's bench with 1:06 to play. With Boston clinging to its 103-102 edge, Tatum airballed a long shot from the right corner, and Hield grabbed the rebound with 5.7 seconds left. Bogdanovic's long jumper bounced off the rim, and the ball was tipped out of bounds in a battle for the rebound as the horn sounded. Hield scored 21 points in the third quarter, going 8 for 11 from the floor, including 5 of 8 from beyond the arc, and the teams entered the fourth tied at 75. Brown had nine in the quarter. ""In the third quarter, I felt good,"" he said. ""I just came in locked in. All it takes is one to go in, and it started trickling down the lineup."" But, at the start of the fourth, Hield headed to the locker room and a trainer was stretching both of Brown's legs while he was on his back at the side of the bench. Both returned midway into the final quarter. TIP-INS Kings: In their last meeting against the Celtics, Hield had a game-high 35 points for his only other 30-point game this season. It was his 10th career game of 30 or more, and three have come against Boston. ... Richaun Holmes entered tied for the league lead in field goal percentage (66.1). He went 4 for 6 and finished with 8 points. Celtics: Head team physician Dr. Tony Schena said Walker didn't suffer a serious injury, but the Celtics were going to keep him out until he goes through a full practice, which is expected to be Tuesday. The doctor said Walker didn't have a concussion, but the team is going through the protocol. . Hayward (fractured left hand) worked out Sunday without a brace and sat on the bench in street clothes without one Monday. . Smart had his left ring wrapped after the game. He said he jammed it. MOPPING UP The ball got stuck between the shot clock and top of backboard in the first quarter. Smart grabbed a mop, turned it upside down and pushed the ball free with the handle. YOUNG AT HEART Coach Brad Stevens joked about having so many young players on the court at the same time. ""Butler had older players today,"" he said of where he coached in college before the Celtics hired him.","401160886"
"MIAMI --  Bam Adebayo still remembers all the painful details of his rookie season, when the Miami Heat couldnt use him in a lot of situations because he was still learning everything. Those days are long gone. Adebayo scored 21 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, Jimmy Butler also scored 21 points and the Heat remained unbeaten at home with a 117-100 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. It was Adebayos ninth double-double this season, and the Heat are 9-0 in those games. I know humble beginnings, Adebayo said. I remember when I wasnt playing. So I always remember where I came from and from where I started. Ive worked hard for this. Kendrick Nunn scored 19 points, Tyler Herro added 18 and Kelly Olynyk finished with 15 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for Miami. The Heat are 7-0 at home for only the second time -- they went 8-0 at home to start the 2012-13 championship season. And they're not just winning at home, but they're winning big. The Heat have led by at least 15 points in all seven of their home games, by at least 20 in six of them. The margin on Monday night got up to 23. This is a step in the right direction, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Guys are taking it to heart. Terry Rozier had 19 points and nine assists for Charlotte, which has dropped five in a row. Devonte' Graham scored 16 and Malik Monk scored 13 for the Hornets, who were outrebounded 49-35. Rozier had a three-point play with 8:36 left to get Charlotte within 14, but an 11-2 run by the Heat over the next 4:18 put the game away. The message was the defense has to get better and has to improve, Hornets coach James Borrego said. Right now we're physically soft, we lack intensity on that end of the floor, when teams make runs we tend to hang our head and we've just got to get better. That comes with time, that comes with accountability and execution, and we've got to get better on that end of the floor."" Miami used nine players -- and had no others available. James Johnson was sent home pregame because he was sick, and Udonis Haslem was also out with an illness. Dion Waiters remains on his 10-game suspension, while Justise Winslow (concussion), Derrick Jones Jr. (hip) and KZ Okpala (Achilles) are still hurt. Winslow and Jones may practice Tuesday. The Heat were so thin depth-wise that when Olynyk got shaken up with an arm problem in the third quarter, he remained in the game despite being in obvious discomfort. Good teams take care of their business at home, Olynyk said. When teams come in here, we have to win, plain and simple. When you get in the playoffs, you have to win on your home floor. So it starts now. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte has now had separate losing streaks of three, four and five games already this season. ... The Hornets lost Cody Zeller in the third quarter to a left hip contusion. ... P.J. Washington, who scored 27 points in his first game and was averaging 13.1 points through his first 13 contests, scored only eight Monday. He has a total of 28 points in his last five games. Heat: Miami still has not trailed by more than eight at home this season, though that seemed in jeopardy when Charlotte ran out to a 7-0 lead to start the game. ... The Heat had a six-point trip in the second quarter. Nunn hit a 3-pointer while Olynyk was the recipient of a flagrant foul from Nicolas Batum. Olynyk made a free throw, then Herro made a long jumper on the ensuing Miami possession. BABY WATCH Spoelstra is keeping a phone nearby at all times these days, with good reason. Spoelstra and his wife Nikki are expecting their second child, one that could be arriving in the next few days. ""We have a little bit of time,"" he said. ""I also thought we had a little bit of time last time."" Spoelstra missed a game late in March 2018 when the couple's first son was born. GRAHAM RETURNS Graham didn't play in either of Charlotte's games in Miami last season, though Monday wasn't his first time on the Heat floor. He dropped 35 for Kansas in a game against Syracuse at Miami on Dec. 2, 2017 -- shooting 10 for 17 from the field, 7 for 13 from 3-point range.","401160887"

Pascal Siakam scored 25 points, Fred VanVleet added 24 and the Raptors held Embiid scoreless for the first time in his career in a 101-96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. ""I can't have this type of production,"" Embiid said. ""I would have never thought I would be here talking about zero points in an NBA game, but it is what it is. Some nights you make shots, some nights you don't. Some nights you're hot, some nights you're cold."" It was the first meeting between the teams since Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beater that bounced off the rim four times before dropping, the winning basket in Game 7 of the second round of the playoffs in May. Toronto went on to win its first NBA title, before Leonard left for the LA Clippers. Embiid, who was left tearful after that postseason defeat, didn't do much Monday to erase those bad memories. Still, his teammates didn't seem worried about their star center's scoreless outing. ""Everyone has down games,"" Sixers guard Ben Simmons said. ""No one is Superman. It happened tonight to Jo, but he's going to be good."" Embiid shot 0-for-11, missing all four of his shots from 3-point range and going 0-for-3 at the free throw line. He finished with a game-high 13 rebounds. ""Defensively, they're everywhere,"" Embiid said of the Raptors. ""They're so long and they make sure they pack the paint.'' Toronto's Marc Gasol scored just three points, but played a large part in controlling Embiid. ""I think you give Marc Gasol, a former Defensive Player of the Year, credit,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""It was a long night for Jo."" Embiid was playing for the fourth time in six days, but he denied feeling worn down by Philly's schedule. ""I didn't look fatigued, and I was definitely not fatigued,"" he said.

Philadelphia's Furkan Korkmaz hit a 3, Horford made a baseline jumper and Harris added a hook shot as the 76ers used a 7-0 run to build a 94-88 lead with 5:16 left to play. Powell and VanVleet hit 3-pointers that cut the gap to two, 96-94, but Toronto missed three straight chances to tie it. Gasol missed a pair from the line, a jump shot by Siakam missed the mark and Harris blocked Anunoby's fast-break drive after an Embiid turnover. Siakam ended Toronto's drought with a three-point play, giving the Raptors a one-point edge, 97-96, with 1:01 left. Siakam forced a turnover on an entry pass from Simmons with 12 seconds remaining to preserve Toronto's lead. VanVleet was fouled and made two shots, giving the Raptors a three-point cushion.

Anthony scored 25 points in just his fourth game of the season, CJ McCollum added 21 and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Chicago Bulls 117-94 on Monday night. Anthony was 10 for 20 from the field, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers. He had averaged 13 points on 15-for-44 (34.1%) shooting in his first three games. Its a humbling situation for me, but its a testament to the work Ive been putting in, he said. My body feels good, mentally I feel good. Besides sharp shooting behind the 3-point line, the 10-time All-Star featured his usual mid-range game and even had a dunk. Vintage, McCollum said. We pulled out some old, good wine in there. Getting to his spots, hitting 3s, he got a dunk and he was talking like he always does on defense. Anthony now has 25,615 career points to move ahead of Alex English (26,613) into 18th place on the NBAs career scoring list. You dont want to take none of that stuff for granted, he said.

LaVine was just 1 for 5 on 3-pointers two days after making 13 of 17 while scoring a career-high 49 points Saturday at Charlotte. We played against a good half-court defensive team, LaVine said.

""We threw everything at him. We threw everybody at him. We threw double-teams and he made plays out of the post,"" said Jazz guard Mike Conley. ""He got to the free throw line. When he started making the long-range shot, that really makes it tough. I was proud of the way we defended. We tried rebounding and tried to box him out, and he was too tall, too long."" Milwaukee led 120-113 with 1:24 left, but Bojan Bogdanovic countered with a 3-pointer and Donovan Mitchell followed with a layup to make 120-118 with 43 seconds left. The Bucks missed on their next possession, but Brook Lopez blocked Mitchell's driving layup attempt with 4.4 seconds remaining. Wesley Matthews added 19 points and Eric Bledsoe 13 for the Bucks, whose last loss was at Utah on Nov. 8. Bogdanovic had 24 points and Mitchell 20 for the Jazz, who were 21 of 45 on 3-pointers.

""Great game and all that. My second 50-point game of my career. Doing it with zero turnovers and all that, that's great.

""(We) had enough stops. More importantly, against a good team, we were able to make some shots. I was really pleased with the third quarter."" The Jazz used a 10-0 run early in the second quarter to go in front 35-25. Milwaukee missed seven consecutive shots during that span, including 0 for 5 from beyond the arc.

Bledsoe's short pull-up jumper from the right baseline was negated when he was called for an offensive foul for jumping back into Bogdanovic.

He had 12 points in the fourth quarter on 4-for-8 shooting along with five assists. James was surprised by the cheers given he was the recipient of thunderous boos when he played against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals with Miami. Im very appreciative because Ive definitely gotten a lot of boos in this building in my career, playing a lot of finals games in this building, James said. To be able to have that support and they respect the way I play the game and they love the Lakers, its just a very humbling moment. Lakers fans had a lot to cheer this season in San Antonio. The Lakers (15-2) have one game remaining against the Spurs on Feb. 4 in Los Angeles but have already won the three-game series against their longtime rivals in the Western Conference. Davis added 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Lakers in his final game before returning to New Orleans on Wednesday. LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and DeRozan added 22 for the Spurs. San Antonio fell to 6-12 after its 11th loss in 13 games. Aldridge started the game 3 for 4, including his 10th 3-pointer of the season, while primarily being defended by James. It was one of the few times the Spurs got the best of James. DeRozan competed for nine seasons with Toronto against James when he was with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Heat. DeRozan never got past James to reach the NBA Finals during his tenure with the Raptors. Its tough, LeBron is LeBron for a reason, DeRozan said. Hes been doing it for 17 years. I faced him a lot throughout my career. You just try to throw different looks at him, but a guy like that has seen every look, every combination of rotations. Youve just got to make it difficult and hope he misses. James finished 13 for 24 from the field and 4 for 7 on 3-pointers in 35 minutes. Trey Lyles blocked Davis short jumper in the paint with 20 seconds left in the first half. Dejounte Murray collected the block and sprinted downcourt for a layup but James ran down the Spurs speedy point guard and blocked his attempt from behind. The play was reminiscent of James block of Golden States Andre Iguodala with less than 2 minutes remaining in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, which the Cleveland Cavaliers won. James hit consecutive step-back 3-pointers in the fourth quarter that produced a 93-85 lead and followed it up with a drive and alley-oop pass to JaVale McGee for his 10th assist of the evening. TIP-INS Lakers: Danny Green, who played eight seasons in San Antonio including the 2014 championship season, received a huge ovation during starting lineup introductions. Green is 3-1 against the Spurs since his departure, averaging 6.5 points and 4.5 rebounds.  Los Angeles is 83-89 against the Spurs in the series history.  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is averaging 14 points and shooting 5 for 10 on 3-pointers against the Spurs this season.  Dwight Howard picked up his fifth foul with 19 seconds remaining in the third quarter. Howard finished with no points and a rebound in 18 minutes. Spurs: San Antonio opted to start Derrick White over Murray. White started at point guard last season after Murray suffered a knee injury during the preseason. Murray started the first 12 games he was active for but was replaced by Patty Mills and White in two games since while battling turnovers and inconsistency.  White joined Willie Anderson and Alvin Robertson as the only players in franchise history with 800 points, 300 rebounds and 300 assists in their first 100 career games with the Spurs. STILL UP San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich praised DeRozan and Aldridge for remaining positive during the Spurs recent skid. Got to. Got to, DeRozan said. Granted everybody hates losing, sucks to lose, but with that youve got to be resilient. Somebody once told me a mountain cant be a mountain if its smooth, whatever that may mean.","401160891"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Once Chris Paul gets in midrange jumper territory he considers it my version of a layup. Ill take that, he said. Paul hit a 19-footer with 36 seconds left to put Oklahoma City ahead and Alec Burks missed a contested shot in the paint moments later on the other end, sending the Thunder to their first road win of the season with a 100-97 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Nice. I didnt even know this was our first road win, Paul said. Thats sickening. That was crazy. ... Well take it, keep on moving. The Warriors led most of the way before the Thunder scored the final 13 points. Chaotic. We couldnt handle their defensive pressure, they turned it up and forced some turnovers, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ... It was frustrating because we had the game right in our grasp and just couldnt finish it off. More than anything I just feel sick for our guys because they continue to compete and work. They deserve better. But on the other hand we werent good enough to close the game out and so we didnt deserve to win. Glenn Robinson III scored 25 points and Ky Bowman added 24 as injury-plagued Golden State competed with just eight healthy players. The Warriors lost their third straight game and 10th in 11, committing five of their 12 turnovers in the final quarter. Its frustrating. Being a young team is not an excuse for that last four minutes of basketball we played, Robinson said. Eric Paschall contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds as injured Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson cheered their young teammates from the bench. Pauls 3-pointer with 3:01 remaining got the Thunder within 97-90 and Dennis Schroder hit from deep the next time down to make it a four-point game. Schroder scored 22 points off the bench and dished out five assists. Paul struggled early to find his shooting stroke but finished with 20 points, while Danilo Gallinari had 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Thunder moved to 1-6 on the road. Oklahoma City snapped a three-game skid -- those defeats coming by a combined 10 points. The Thunder also are without a key playmaker, losing guard Hamidou Diallo for four to six weeks with a hyperextension sprain in his right elbow. The Oklahoma City-Golden State matchup is a far cry from what it had been in recent years with Kevin Durant playing for the Warriors against his old team. Durant departed in the offseason to join the Brooklyn Nets. TIP-INS Thunder: C Nerlens Noel returned after missing Fridays game with an illness. ... The Thunder are 8-13 on the road against the Warriors during the OKC era ... Oklahoma City returns to Chase Center on March 28. ... The Thunder already beat the Warriors twice at home, including 120-92 on Oct. 27 to match their largest margin of victory against Golden State and led by 33 points at halftime. Warriors: Draymond Green missed a third straight game with a sore right heel. Its lingering, coach Steve Kerr said. It doesnt seem like its going to be anything that goes on for too long. Its also not something we want to aggravate and keep him out for a long period of time. ... D'Angelo Russell missed his fifth game in a row with a sprained right thumb but is expected to travel on the teams upcoming road trip and will be re-evaluated Saturday. The Warriors miss his playmaking, as Russell has dished out seven or more assists in each of his last four games. ... Willie Cauley-Stein had his career-best streak of at least one block end at nine straight games. ... Golden State trails the season series 3-0 after the two road losses. The Warriors won the regular-season series 2-1 last season. DIALLO HURT The Thunder announced Diallos status earlier Monday, saying he would be re-evaluated after that timeframe. In Fridays 130-127 home loss to the Lakers, Diallo left in the fourth quarter after taking contact from LeBron James on a driving layup early in the period. Diallo had just returned from a three-game absence for a sprained left knee. He has played in 12 games with one start, averaging 8.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals in 21.4 minutes. I think for him, being out for a couple games and then coming back and playing like he did, I think for any young player, the concern always for those guys is: Where am I going to fit in? How am I going to fit in when I get back? Am I behind the 8-ball, am I the last guy? coach Billy Donovan said. And thats not the case I think for our team. We need Hami and I told him that when he comes back were going to put him right back into the rotation and try to get him back to where he had been playing before the injury.","401160892"
"Paul George notes the Clippers offense is a work in progress, but the defense is cohesive and everyone is working together. (0:34) DALLAS --  Paul George and Kawhi Leonard gave the young European duo from the Dallas Mavericks the best look yet at life among the elite in the Western Conference. George scored 17 of his 26 points in the first quarter, Leonard finished with 28 and the Los Angeles Clippers took control early in a meeting of teams with matching five-game winning streaks, beating the Mavericks 114-99 on Tuesday night. The Clippers used several defenders to end Luka Doncic's franchise-record streak of four games with at least 30 points and 10 assists, knocking the 20-year-old phenom to the floor early on a 4-of-14 shooting night. Doncic had 22 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Kristaps Porzingis was 4 of 13, the 7-foot-3 Latvian combining with the Rookie of the Year from Slovenia to go 8 of 27 compared to 19 of 42 for the LA stars. George added a career-high six steals to help hold the Mavericks under 100 points for the first time this season. ""They're looking to win a championship; they played like it was a playoff game,"" said Porzingis, who hit a 28-footer 22 seconds into the game and another 3-pointer from the logo at center court just before halftime but finished 3 of 8 from long range. He had 15 points and 10 rebounds. ""They played aggressively and they showed us that we have to learn how to play these games. We have to bring that same intensity."" Patrick Beverley got in foul trouble as one of the defenders assigned to Doncic, who had to settle for doing most of his damage on free throws, making 14 of 16. Beverley getting his fourth foul early in the second half just brought back Lou Williams sooner. The high-scoring reserve finished with 21 points, going 4 of 7 on 3s while Doncic missed all seven of his deep tries against the LA defense. ""That's who we are as a team,"" said George, who had all four of his 3-pointers in the first quarter. ""We pride ourselves on defense. Offensively, we've got guys that can score the ball, but we want to make it tough on a nightly basis on whoever we're playing."" The Mavericks had taken the Southwest Division lead with a win at Houston for their fifth straight victory, and weren't too far removed from a loss to LeBron James and the Lakers that required a buzzer-beating 3 to force overtime in Dallas. But the other expected title contenders from LA offered a dose of reality for a team looking to end a three-season run without reaching the playoffs. Dallas was trailing by three when Doncic joined the rest of the starters on the bench in the final minute of the first quarter. By the time those five came back together in the second, the Los Angeles lead was 48-32. The LA bench scored 16 of the 20 points during the run, with Leonard getting the other four. The NBA's highest-scoring bench finished with 44 points. Dallas, fourth on that list, scored 37 bench points, most with the outcome no longer in doubt. ""They're big, they're strong, they're highly skilled,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""They pick you up full court and they hound you. This is a game we've got to learn from and do better next time."" TIP-INS Clippers: Montrezl Harrell scored 12 points two nights after tying his career high with 34 against New Orleans to help finish a sweep of a five-game homestand. ... Leonard had a team high-tying eight rebounds, and Williams had six rebounds and six assists. Mavericks: Doncic had a third straight game without a triple-double, the longest run without one this season for the NBA's leader in that category (seven). ... Dallas shot a season-low 38 percent. ... Seth Curry scored 13 off the bench, and J.J. Barea had 12. TURNOVER TIME Doncic committed seven turnovers and has six games with at least six turnovers this season. The Mavericks had 20, two off their season high in their second game with at least that many. ""Wanted to do the best job we could on Luka,"" Leonard said. ""He's been killing it lately, playing at a very, very high level. We just wanted to make it difficult for him tonight, get some deflections and I think we were able to do that."" COMFORTABLY IN FRONT The Clippers led by double digits most of the last three quarters, peaking at a 24-point lead with three minutes to go in the game. George put LA in front for good with a 3-pointer for a 23-21 lead with 4:25 left in the first quarter.","401160893"
"DENVER --  Gary Harris isn't putting up big scoring numbers. Its the guard's defense that has spearheaded the Denver Nuggets' rise to the top of the Western Conference. After another shutdown night, Harris teammates are campaigning for him to be on the NBA's all-defensive team. ""We're not joking around with first team,"" Jamal Murray said. ""He's been showing it. Not just one game, not just two games, but all season long."" Harris held Washington guard Bradley Beal to a season-low 14 points, Nikola Jokic had a season-high 20 rebounds and Jerami Grant added a season-best 20 points to lead the Nuggets to a 117-104 win over the Wizards on Tuesday night. Jokic finished one rebound shy of his career best and scored eight points in Denver's sixth straight win. Will Barton had 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, Murray added 16 points and Mason Plumlee scored 15 for the Nuggets, who are 10-1 in November and ended a three-game home losing streak against Washington. Beal, the Wizards leading scorer averaging 29.6 points, failed to score 20 points for the first time this season and was held to 6-for-15 shooting. He was 2 of 10 from behind the 3-point line. ""Anytime you can manage the best player on the other team, you start with that,"" Plumlee said. ""Brad Beal's a heck of a player and he didn't get 20, 30 points."" It is a familiar theme when the Nuggets face an elite guard. Houston's James Harden scored just 27 points, 10 below his season average, and Devin Booker had just 12 when Phoenix was in Denver on Sunday night. ""That's all Gary,"" Grant said. ""He's locking everybody up this year. He's shutting everyone down."" Denver held one of the NBA's prolific offenses to its second-fewest point total of the season. Washington entered the game averaging 119.1 points and had failed to score at least 100 points just once in 15 games. It needed 35 in the fourth to reach 100 this time. Jordan McRae had 21 points and Moritz Wagner and Davis Bertans each finished with 14. The Nuggets grabbed control in the second quarter, opening a 17-point lead after Washington led 27-26 early in the period. Grant had 15 points in the second and 16 in the half as Denver took a 64-47 lead into the break. ""They did a good job all night just trying to get downhill,"" McRae said. ""I think we have to do a better job of helping each other going up in the paint, just knowing everybody has everybody's back."" The Nuggets pushed the lead to 20 points in the third quarter and after Washington closed within 14 midway through the fourth quarter, Barton converted a rare 4-point play to make it 107-89. Those were the only four points of the fourth for Barton, who was the only Denver starter to play in the quarter. Denver shot 52.2 percent and had 70 points in the paint. ""We gave them no resistance. There was no physicality,"" Wizards coach Scotty Brooks said. ""When you don't give any resistance to a great team, they're going to get 70 points in the paint."" TIP-INS Wizards: Guard Isaiah Thomas received warm applause from the crowd when he was announced as a starter. He played 12 games with the Nuggets last season. ... Washington was 1 of 16 from the 3-point line in the first half and finished 10 of 40 from behind the arc. Nuggets: Their last home win against the Wizards was March 12, 2016. Denver outscored Washington by 24 in the fourth quarter to win by 16. ... The Nuggets weren't called for a foul in the first quarter. They picked up six in the first 2:46 of the second quarter. ...

"Kemba details how missing one game helped him figure out different ways to help the Celtics win. (1:18) BOSTON --  Kemba Walker scored 39 points in his first game back after leaving the court on a stretcher, with his neck in a brace. It was almost enough to make the Boston fans forget about the guy he replaced. But not quite. On a night the fans seemed more interested in taunting former Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving, Walker returned from a neck injury to score a season high and lead Boston to a 121-110 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. ""I've been over it. I could have played last game, honestly,"" Walker said. ""If I'm on the court, I'm on the court. I wasn't thinking about anything (but) wanting to win."" Walker left Boston's game against Denver on Friday after a head-to-torso collision with Semi Ojeleye and missed Monday's game against Sacramento. He played 31 minutes on Wednesday, adding six rebounds and four assists. He scored 13 in the third quarter, when the Celtics scored nine in a row to turn a one-point deficit into a 91-83 lead they never relinquished. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said sometimes head-first collisions can be serious even though they don't look all that bad, and sometimes the ones that look bad turn out to be minor. ""For him to be playing, and even feeling fresh, five days later is very fortunate,"" Stevens said. ""It's good to see."" Jaylen Brown added 22 points and 10 rebounds and Jayson Tatum had 16 points and nine boards for the Celtics, who improved to 7-0 at home. Garrett Temple scored 22 points and Joe Harris had 21 for Brooklyn, which made a season-high 21 of the 56 3-point shots it attempted. Jarrett Allen had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and Spencer Dinwiddie had 16 points and 11 assists. But the biggest name for the Nets -- at least as far as the Boston fans were concerned -- was Irving, who has missed the last seven games with a sore shoulder. The crowd came to heckle him, even in his absence. Posters branding him as a coward decorated the arena entrance. A few fans who showed up wearing his No. 11 Celtics jersey with the words ""Where is?"" written on tape above his name. During the introductions, with Irving nowhere to be seen, the first ""Kyrie Sucks!"" chant broke out; it was repeated about a dozen times throughout the game. (There was also a ""Yankees Suck!"" chant, just because.) ""I don't give a second thought,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Just tune it out."" About an hour after the game ended, Irving posted a long Instagram story calling sports and entertainment ""ignorant and obtrusive."" ""It's one big show that means very VERY little in the real world that most people live in,"" the lengthy and rambling post said before concluding with: ""Don't fall for the Game that's played in front of you for Entertainment, it'll never be as serious dealing with LIFE."" The Nets, like the Celtics before them, are doing better without him. They came into the night with a 5-1 record since Irving went out with a sore shoulder, climbing above .500 for the first time this season. The Celtics made it to the Eastern Conference finals two years ago when Irving was injured, and lost in the second round last season with him. TIP-INS Nets: Have not beaten the Celtics in Boston in their last seven tries. They had won three in a row on the road; they have not won four straight road games since 2008. Celtics: Injured forward Gordon Hayward took the microphone to wish the crowd a happy Thanksgiving before the opening tip. TURNING POINT Brooklyn led 83-82 with just over 3 minutes left in the third when the Celtics scored the next nine points before Temple made a 3 to close out the third quarter. Boston led 104-101 in the fourth before scoring 17 of the next 24 points -- nine of them from Walker -- to put away the game. MAN OF MANY TALENTS When the ball got stuck between the backboard and the shot clock in the final minutes, Celtics guard Marcus Smart grabbed a mop to jar it loose. The fans responded with an ""M-V-P!"" chant. Smart also pulled off a similar rescue on Monday night. ""He's one of a kind,"" Stevens deadpanned. ""We knew when that ball was stuck behind the backboard there was only one man to get it done.""","401160895"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nothing seems to help the Charlotte Hornets shake out of a slump better than the Detroit Pistons. Bismack Biyombo scored 19 points, Devonte Graham had 16 points and a career-high 15 assists and the Hornets beat the Pistons for the eighth straight time with a 102-101 victory on Wednesday night. Rookie P.J. Washington added 17 points, Miles Bridges had 15 and Nic Batum 13 for Charlotte (7-11), which snapped a five-game losing streak. The Hornets haven't lost to the Pistons since the 2017-18 season. Blake Griffin scored 26 points for Detroit. Charlotte has only had three longer winning streaks against an opponent. The Hornets won 13 in a row over Orlando from 2016-18, 11 straight over the Pistons from 1993-95 and nine consecutive over the Chicago Bulls from 1999-01. ""We just shared the ball, played for each other and we care about each other,"" said Biyombo, who was making his second start of the season. ""I think that's the most important thing because at the end of the day we are all we got. The guys embraced the challenge from the coach yesterday as we came in."" Charlotte coach James Borrego said that challenge was improve on the defensive end. ""Well, the last 24 hours, 48 hours, we talked about our defense,"" said Borrego, whose team entered the game 21st in the NBA in scoring defense at 113.9 points per game. ""I thought we got off to a good start defensively. We really did. ""Tonight was about our defense. That's what got it done."" The Hornets withstood a final Detroit possession that didn't end with a shot attempt despite three inbounds attempts in the final 12.3 seconds. After the final one with 7.9 seconds to play, Derrick Rose drove into the lane before passing to Luke Kennard on the left baseline. But Kennard couldn't get a shot off before the buzzer. ""I got it at the top,"" said the veteran Rose, who is playing his first season with Detroit. ""It was the spacing that was messed up. You live and you learn. First year with the team so you figure it out."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey knew it was a missed opportunity. ""Would've, could've, should've,"" said Casey, whose team lost 109-106 at Charlotte in the teams' first meeting on Nov. 15 on Malik Monk's 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""It always looks like it comes down the last play and the execution of it. Just scoring a little quicker and that comes from being together and understanding what we are doing. I can't fault anybody on that last play but just go a little quicker. We got what we wanted and were about to get what we wanted but just (go) a little sooner."" Charlotte scored the game's first six points and led 25-14 with 5:11 left in the first quarter before the Pistons closed out the quarter strong to take a 32-31 lead. Detroit maintained a 60-55 halftime lead before Charlotte retook the lead for good at 82-80 late in the third quarter. A pair of 3-pointers by Griffin in the final 4:13 cut the Hornets' lead to 95-94 with 4:13 to play and then 102-101 with 41 seconds left. TIP-INS: Pistons: Guard/forward Tony Snell played in his first game since Nov. 15 after missing four games with a left hip strain. Snell, who entered averaging 9.2 points, came off the bench and went scoreless in 19 minutes. He missed both field goal attempts, including one 3-pointer. Hornets: Center Cody Zeller didn't play after a left hip injury in Monday's 117-100 loss at Miami. It was the second game this season that Zeller has missed; he missed the Oct. 25 loss to Minnesota due to personal reasons. Since Zeller's rookie year of 2013-14 when he played in all 82 games, he has missed 20, nine, 20, 49 and 33 games, respectively, in the previous five seasons.","401160896"
"CLEVELAND --  The short-handed Orlando Magic finally left a road arena with a victory. Evan Fournier scored a season-high 30 points and the Magic won away from home for first time this season, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 116-104 on Wednesday night. The Magic, playing without center Nikola Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon, were 0-7 on the road going into the game. ""The guys could have put their heads down and mailed it in at the end of a road trip, but they fought through it tonight,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Vucevic and Gordon both missed their third straight game with right ankle injuries, but the Magic didn't need two of their top players. ""The way we came out with defense and playing hard, that's a true test of character,"" Fournier said. Not only has Cleveland lost eight of nine, Kevin Love's sore back continues to be an issue. The veteran forward returned after missing two games but was limited to 24 minutes, scoring nine points and grabbing five rebounds. Love went to the locker room early in the second half and returned to play five minutes in the fourth quarter before being removed. Cavaliers coach John Beilein said Love wasn't himself and isn't sure what the next step will be in dealing with the injury. ""I have no idea how to interpret it yet,"" Beilein said. ""If you've had a bad back, from one day to another day you don't know what it's going to be like. He wants to go out there and give it his all. He wants to play even when he's hurt. When he's out there playing hurt but he can't move the way he functionally needs to move, it's not good for him and it's not good for us."" Terrence Ross and Jonathan Isaac each scored 16 points for Orlando, which went ahead for good early in the second quarter and steadily built the lead. Cleveland cut a 17-point deficit to 98-90 midway through the fourth, but Markelle Fultz and Mo Bamba hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions for the Magic. Fournier was 10 of 22 from the field and made all six of his free throws, falling two points shy of his career high. Cleveland committed a season-high 25 turnovers. Collin Sexton scored 20 points and rookie Darius Garland added 16, but also had eight turnovers. Orlando, which led by nine at halftime, used a 13-3 run to begin the third quarter to go ahead 72-55 for its biggest lead. The Magic maintained a double-figure advantage for most of the second half. Vucevic averages a team-high 11.6 rebounds and is Orlando's second-leading scorer at 17.1 points per game. Gordon averages 13.1 points and 6.2 rebounds. Tristan Thompson had 13 points and 15 rebounds for Cleveland. TIP-INS Magic: Fultz and Bamba each scored 15 points. ... D.J. Augustin had 10 assists. ... Gordon went through drills during shootaround, but still isn't ready to play. Cavaliers: Love didn't play against Portland on Saturday when Cleveland broke a six-game losing streak. He also missed Monday's loss to Brooklyn. ... C John Henson hasn't played since the second game of the season because of a strained right hamstring. ""He decided he was not ready yet, that he needs more time to heal,"" Beilein said. IT'S NOT EASY Vucevic and Gordon were injured against Toronto and didn't play against Indiana or Detroit. ""It stinks having a teammate down like Vuch and Aaron, but you have to do your job and do your best,"" Bamba said. THAT'S TOO MANY Beilein was unhappy with the turnovers, which included several traveling violations. ""You have 25 turnovers in a game, you're not going to win,"" he said. ""It's one thing if we're throwing the ball away, but not getting a shot at the basket because of a walk, I've got to figure that out.""","401160897"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers have found the perfect early season balance. They're moving the ball, sharing the scoring burden and finding ways to win. On Wednesday night, Domantas Sabonis and T.J. Warren each scored 23 points and Malcolm Brogdon added 22 to spur a decisive fourth-quarter run that helped Indiana pull away from Utah 121-102. ""When you have a number of guys who can score and they're offensive-minded, what you have to get is that team to sacrifice,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""These guys are sacrificing right now."" And it's showing up in the results. Since losing their first three games, the Pacers have won 11 of 14 including four straight. Four of their last five wins have come by double digits and they've done it by taking advantage of their collective strengths. Sabonis again did the dirty work inside, grabbing 12 rebounds for his 12th double-double this season. Brogdon and Jeremy Lamb took care of their job in the backcourt by flirting with their own double-doubles. Brogdon added eight assists while Lamb had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Defensively, the Pacers were just as proficient. They held the Jazz to 43.4% shooting and just 10 of 32 on 3-pointers while Bojan Bogdanovic and Donovan Mitchell accounted for more than half of Utah's total points. Bogdanovic, who left the Pacers last summer in free agency, scored 30 in his first game back. Mitchell added 26 and the Jazz spent the entire second half futilely chasing the Pacers before losing its second straight game. ""They felt comfortable the entire time,"" Mitchell said. ""We've got to get over screens, helping, the bigs, the guards, it's really all of us just communicating (better on defense) and we'll fix it."" At least, Utah made the Pacers earn this one. When it appeared Indiana might run away after closing the first half on a 12-2 spurt and opening the second half with a 3-pointer from Myles Turner to take a 56-43 lead, Bogdanovic and Mitchell helped the Jazz respond. They combined for five of Utah's seven 3s in the third quarter, helping them scramble back within 83-80 with 2:03 to go. But Indiana rebuilt its lead by scoring the final six points of the quarter and finally put the game away with that decisive 18-5 run, which began with 7:45 left to play. ""We came ready to play,"" Brogdon said. ""We competed from the first minute to the last. The second group came in and did a great job. We were consistent all the way through."" TIP-INS Jazz: Have lost three straight in the series and back-to-back games for the third time this season. ... Two-time defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert returned after missing the previous two games with a sprained left ankle and had 14 points and 13 rebounds. ... Joe Ingles scored 12 points and Mike Conley had five points and five assists in his hometown.

"Staff Sergeant Ivan Thomas has an emotional moment as he reunites with his son after being deployed for 18 months. (0:25) PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid got back to playing the kind of game he expects from himself and nothing like the worst game of his career two nights prior. Embiid had 33 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 97-91 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. He was scoreless Monday night in a 101-96 loss at Toronto. In 32 minutes against the Raptors, the star big man went 0-for-11 from the field, including 0-for-4 from the arc and missed all three of his free throws. Against the Kings, he scored the first points of the game with an emphatic dunk 23 seconds in and had some key points late in the game to help Philadelphia improve to 8-0 at home. He finished 10-of-19 from the field and 12-of-14 from the free throw line. ""I should play like that every night,"" Embiid said. ""After the last performance, I had to be a little more aggressive."" Embiid said he felt more ""free"" than he did being guarded by Toronto's Marc Gasol and a constant double-teamer, and Kings coach Luke Walton said his team wasn't able to execute its plan. ""Our plan was to double, but we didn't do a good job early,"" he said. ""We were soft and late."" Of Embiid's 14 trips to the foul line, Walton said, ""We have to be more disciplined."" Philadelphia rookie Matisse Thybulle scored all 15 of his career-best points in the second half. Thybulle was needed after Josh Richardson didn't return in the second half due to right hamstring tightness. Thybulle, who entered averaging 3.4 points, added four steals and two blocks while making all five of his shots, including three 3-pointers. ""You have to be ready for every opportunity,"" Thybulle said. Buddy Hield scored 22 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 18 for the Kings. They were 1-3 on a four-game trip. Hield, coming off a career-high 41 points at Boston on Monday night, made 3 of 12 3-pointers and 9 of 24 shots overall. Sacramento closed within five, 92-87, thanks to a 14-2 run. But Embiid scored from close to put the 76ers up 94-87 and then hit a pair from the line to make it 96-87 with 1:41 left. SHOOTING SIMMONS? Ben Simmons' continued reluctance to shoot conventional jump shots remains an issue in Philadelphia. Simmons hit his first career 3-pointer against the Knicks on Nov. 20, but he hasn't tried a true 3 -- his shot-clock heave Monday at Toronto notwithstanding. Coach Brett Brown repeatedly has defended his star point guard, saying that his jump shot will come in time. He again was asked several times prior to Wednesday's game about Simmons' shot. ""In general, I want him to shoot more,"" Brown said. ""There are available shots he can look at more."" Brown said it's something Simmons continues to work on in practice. Simmons drained a 13-foot turnaround jumper with 6:40 left in the first half, but then didn't touch rim with a try from similar distance a little under a minute later. Simmons finished with 10 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. HOME SWEET HOME Philadelphia remained undefeated at home while selling out for the 101st straight contest. ""We love playing at home,"" Brown said. ""This crowd respects, appreciates and pays for effort, and for the most part, I think that we give it."" TIP-INS Kings: De'Aaron Fox (ankle) missed his eighth straight contest, and Trevor Ariza (personal) was out for his fifth straight game. ... The teams wrap up the two-game season series on March 5 at Sacramento. ... Philadelphia fans booed Nemanja Bjelica, who spurned the 76ers for Europe prior to last offseason. 76ers: Kyle O'Quinn (left calf) and Shake Milton (upper respiratory infection) didn't play. ... Richardson had nine points in 17 first-half minutes.","401160899"
"TORONTO --  Pascal Siakam produced a big night from 3-point range to keep the Toronto Raptors perfect at home. Siakam scored 31 points, OG Anunoby had 13 points and a career-high 12 rebounds and the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 126-98 on Wednesday night, Toronto's franchise-record eighth straight home victory to begin the season. Siakam matched his career high by making five 3-pointers and shot 12 for 22 overall. ""He just keeps seeing them and fires them in there,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Siakam reached 30 or more points for the seventh time this season after having done so five times previously in his career, all last season. ""I'm just continuing to work hard,"" Siakam said. ""Shooting is a part of my game that I continue to work on."" Chris Boucher had 13 points and a season-high 12 rebounds, and Fred VanVleet and Terence Davis each scored 15 points as the Raptors set an NBA record by winning their 33rd straight at home against Atlantic Division opponents. Since divisional play began in the 1970-71 season, only Utah (Nov. 15, 1996 to April 12, 1999) and Golden State (Oct. 30, 2013 to April 12, 2017) have won 32 straight home games against division foes. New York was the opponent the last time Toronto lost at home to an Atlantic team, beating the Raptors 111-109 on Nov. 10, 2015. Julius Randle scored 19 points and Canadian rookie RJ Barrett had 16 as the Knicks matched a season worst by losing their fourth straight. The 28-point margin was New York's worst of the season. The Knicks lost 118-95 to Boston on Oct. 26. ""Right now we're still fighting that fight to trust each other offensively and defensively,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. Malcolm Miller scored a career-high 13 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 12 as the Raptors won their fifth straight, their longest streak of the season. Toronto has won seven in a row against the Knicks, and 15 of the past 16 meetings. Barrett returned after missing Sunday's loss to Brooklyn because of illness. ""I just soldiered through it,"" Barrett said. ""Getting a couple of days or rest really helped me."" The Toronto-born Barrett received a warm ovation when he was introduced with the rest of New York's starting lineup. Barrett shot 5 for 17, going 2 for 8 from 3-point range, in 31 minutes. ""You've got to give their defense credit,"" Fizdale said. ""Those guys really get after it. They're long, they make everything tough. That's not an easy team to just come in and drop numbers on."" Toronto led 10-3 after three minutes but Randle scored 11 points as the Knicks rallied to lead 29-21 after one. Wayne Ellington made three free throws to begin the second, giving the Knicks a 32-21 lead, but New York didn't score again until a basket by Marcus Morris with 7:15 left in the half. Davis and Siakam each made 3-pointers and Siakam added a free throw on Randle's technical foul to cap a 22-2 Toronto run. Siakam scored 15 points in the second and the Raptors led 58-46 at halftime. ""We never were able to answer the run once we were up 11,"" Randle said. Siakam scored 11 points in the third and Toronto took an 89-69 lead to the fourth. TIP-INS Knicks: New York is 1-8 on the road. . G Frank Ntilikina started despite a left quadriceps contusion and a sore groin. . Seven of New York's 14 losses have been by 10 or more points. Raptors: Toronto didn't shoot any free throws in the first quarter. .. Like the Raptors, Boston (7-0), Miami (7-0) and Philadelphia (8-0) have yet to lose at home. . Toronto won seven straight home games to begin the 2018-19 season. . Anunoby recorded his first career double-double. ... The Raptors led by double digits the entire second half. FINDING THEIR RANGE The Raptors shot 3 for 13 from 3-point range in the first quarter but went 18 for 28 the rest of the way. Toronto matched a franchise high with 21 made 3-pointers. It's the third time the Raptors have made 21 3s in a game. KIND OF A BIG DEAL Before his first game in Canada, Barrett spoke to a large crowd of media after the morning shootaround. ""I feel like the president or something,"" said Barrett, who estimated some 300 friends and family were attending the game.","401160900"
"HOUSTON --  When opponents trap and double team James Harden and Russell Westbrook it leaves openings for other players to step up and contribute. On Wednesday night that player was Danuel House, who had a career-high 23 points to help the Rockets to a 117-108 victory over the Miami Heat. ""When those two guys get going downhill it puts a lot of pressure on a lot of people which causes me to be open-open,"" House said. ""So thank you Russ and James."" Harden scored 34 points, Westbrook had 27 and the Rockets snapped a three-game skid. Harden said House is getting better at taking advantages of opportunities when teams double him. ""He works every single day on his shot,"" Harden said. ""Those opportunities are going to come for him and the more confident he gets the easier those shots will be."" Houston led by double digits for most of this one after the Heat used a 46-point first quarter in a 129-100 rout Nov. 3 in the first meeting between the teams this season. ""In the first half we just didn't bring the right competitive, consistent spirit, particularly when we weren't making shots,"" Heat coach Eric Spoelstra said. Kelly Olynyk scored six straight points to get the Heat within 10 with about a minute left. Harden made a free throw after that and Goran Dragic made one for the Heat. There was a bit of a scuffle after a hard foul by Dragic on House with about 30 seconds remaining. It was reviewed and upgraded to a flagrant 1 foul and House received a technical foul for his reaction after the foul. Tyler Herro had 22 points and Olynyk scored 19 points with leading scorer Jimmy Butler out with an illness. Westbrook had nine rebounds and seven assists and Houston had 11 steals they converted into 22 points. Herro scored five straight points for Miami to cut the lead to 17 with about 9 1/2 minutes left. But he turned the ball over on a bad pass after that and House finished with a dunk on the other end to lead Houston up 96-77. The Heat used a 10-3 run, with four points from Justise Winslow, to get to 103-91 with about 5 minutes left. Harden, who finished with seven 3s, made an off-balance 3-pointer from the corner before the Heat got one from Olynyk. A layup by Herro cut the lead to 13 with less than three minutes left before Houston used a 5-2 run with a 3 from House to make it 114-98. Houston led by at least 20 for most of the third quarter and pushed the lead to 86-62 with a dunk by Ben McLemore with about two minutes left in the third quarter. The Heat used a 6-2 spurt, with 3s from Olynyk and Herro, to cut the lead to 20. But Houston scored the last three points of the quarter to take a 91-68 lead into the fourth quarter. After coming out flat in a 137-123 loss to Dallas on Sunday, the Rockets started strong on Wednesday. Harden and Westbrook combined for 42 points in the first half as they built a 66-42 lead. TIP-INS Heat: Miami got 51 points off the bench. ... Bam Adebayo led the Heat's starters with 17 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Heat made 14 of 37 3-pointers. Rockets: C Clint Capela missed the game with a respiratory illness. ... Westbrook received a technical foul in the fourth quarter for yelling at an official when he was unhappy he didn't get a foul call. IMPROVING CLARK Second-year player Gary Clark had 12 points and tied a career-best with eight rebounds in 29 minutes helping to fill in for Capela. Clark hasn't gotten much playing time this season and had logged just 10 minutes this season entering Wednesday's game. ""His number was called and he was ready to go after not really having an opportunity this season,"" Harden said. ""That shows he's learning.""","401160901"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  When Lou Williams missed a floater in the closing seconds, Montrezl Harrell cleaned it up with a dunk to extend the Los Angeles Clippers winning streak. Harrells rebound basket with 2.3 seconds left gave the Clippers their seventh straight victory, 121-119 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. I expected to make the shot, but Im so happy ... that he was there for me, said Williams, who had 24 points and 13 assists. Memphis had one more chance to tie or take the lead, but Jaren Jackson Jr.s 3-point attempt from the right corner was blocked by Maurice Harkless. Harrell and Williams contributed to another strong bench performance from the Clippers, who lead the league with 51.7 points a game from their reserves. Harrell matched Williams with 24 while also grabbing 10 rebounds. Paul George added 22 points. Its just fantastic, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said about having Harrell and Williams off his bench. Its like you have the ultimate relief pitchers coming in the game Its come down to the point where, I think we kind of know each other and know kind of what each other wants to do. Each others tendencies, Harrell said of the reserves play, later adding: Weve got so many different lineups we can throw out there that we can succeed in. Playing the second night of a back-to-back on the road, Los Angeles forward Kawhi Leonard took the night off to with injury management on his left knee. Jonas Valanciunas had 30 points and 16 rebounds for Memphis, both season highs for the center. Jae Crowder and Ja Morant finished with 20 points each, Morant also had 11 assists as the Grizzlies lost their fifth straight. Memphis, which trailed 92-88 entering the fourth, opened the final period on a 13-2 run. That gave Memphis its biggest lead of the game at that point and led to Rivers calling a timeout after Crowder converted his second 3-pointer from the top of the key. We were just playing with energy, said Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who finished with 17 points. The bench came in and made a huge impact. Everyone was running in there and having fun again. The defense just led to the offense more. While Memphis lead reached 10 with just under 7 minutes left, the Clippers had a 15-5 run to tie at 113. The teams exchange leads and the game was tied at 119 before Harrells winning basket. I just try to keep playing, keep executing, just keep fighting all the way through, Harrell said. Thats what it is all about, fighting all the way through to the very end. Leave it all out there. Thats all we can do. TIP-INS Clippers: Rodney McGruder started in Leonards spot, his second start of the season. McGruder would leave in the third quarter with a right lower leg injury. He did not return. ... F Landry Shamet missed his ninth straight game with a high left ankle sprain. Grizzlies: F Kyle Anderson, who was listed as questionable because of right heel soreness, did not play. ... The Clippers held Morant to one shot and no points in the first half. The rookie scored 14 points in the fourth. ... Memphis challenged an out-of-bounds call in the fourth giving the ball to the Clippers. After review, the call was overturned. CLARKE CONNECTION Memphis rookie Brandon Clarke, the 21st overall pick from Gonzaga, was 5 of 8 from the field and has made 60 of 88 over his last 10 games, for 68% over the span. Clarke entered the game leading all rookies in shooting percentage for the season at 63.6%, which also ranks fifth overall. FINAL WORD I just thought you let a team that hasnt been winning hang around, they start to smell it. We talked about it before the game. Obviously, no one heard it. -- Rivers.","401160902"
"MILWAUKEE --  Without Khris Middletons productive return, the Milwaukee Bucks might not have outlasted the Atlanta Hawks. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 10 rebounds, Middleton scored 16 points in his return from injury and the Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 111-102 for their ninth consecutive victory. Middleton, who had been out since Nov. 10 with a thigh contusion, didnt start and played 20 minutes. He helped the Bucks rally after they trailed through three quarters. ""I think guys were trying to pull it together and trying to fight through a little bit of fatigue or (being) banged up,"" the All-Star forward said. ""We're still figuring out ways to win ballgames, which is the most important thing."" Antetokounmpo followed his season-high 50 points on Monday by notching his 18th consecutive double-double. The reigning MVPs streak of double-doubles is the longest to begin a season since Bill Walton opened with 34 straight in 1976-77. Antetokounmpo was 5 for 13 from the free throw line for the Eastern Conference leaders, on their longest winning streak since winning 10 straight in 1985-86. Former Bucks forward Jabari Parker scored a season-high 33 points for the Hawks and added 14 rebounds, also a season high. Trae Young scored 29 points as Atlanta (4-14) dropped its eighth straight. Its always going to be about putting that complete game together and understanding from a strategic standpoint, from a game-plan standpoint, from an effort standpoint, how to do that,"" said Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce. ""The makes and misses arent the issue. Parker, who played for Milwaukee from 2014-18, scored the Hawks first eight points on their way to a 17-15 lead. Then Milwaukee scored 18 straight, getting seven from Middleton, to jump to a 33-17 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Hawks battled back in the second period, behind Parkers 15 points and Youngs 14. By the time Young drained a 3-pointer at the buzzer going into halftime, they had shaved the Bucks lead to 60-59. The Hawks took an 82-81 lead into the fourth, but Antetokounmpo sparked the crowd by scoring over Parker on a drive to the hoop and drawing Parkers fourth foul. Robin Lopez tipped in Antetokounmpos missed free throw, giving Milwaukee an 87-84 lead with just over 10 minutes left. ""The fourth quarter is where we lost, so I'd rather have the momentum at the right time,"" said Parker, who scored only two in the fourth. The game stayed tight until Middleton hit a 3-point basket with just under 4 minutes left to put Milwaukee up 102-93. Milwaukee held Atlanta to 43 points in the second half. TIP-INS Hawks: Guard Kevin Huerter (left rotator cuff strain) missed his eighth straight game. He has also been ruled out for the next two games, on Friday and Saturday. Bucks: Middleton, the teams second-leading scorer who entered Wednesday averaging 18.5 points per game, had been expected to miss three to four weeks. Its probably going to be one or two games and hell be starting, coach Mike Budenholzer said. ... Guard George Hill (back soreness) was out for a second straight game. NET PLUS Entering Wednesday, Milwaukee guard Sterling Brown had the leagues best net rating of 19.6. That is the Bucks point differential per 100 possessions while he is on the court. His teammate, guard Donte DiVincenzo, was second (17). DOUBLES DUTY Parker has scored in double figures in 17 of 18 games. ""It's insane what this kid has gone through,"" Antetokounmpo said of Parker, who suffered two torn ACLs in Milwaukee. ""He's back, he's healthy. He's jumping out of the gym and shooting 3s. I'm really happy for him. I know he had a lot of dark times after both injuries he had, but he's back.""","401160903"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Minnesota Timberwolves six-year stretch of misery in San Antonio is over. Andrew Wiggins scored 26 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 14 rebounds and the Timberwolves beat the Spurs 113-101 on Wednesday night, snapping an 11-game skid in San Antonio. I know I havent won here, Wiggins said, laughing. So, when I heard it, I was like, It sounds correct.  Minnesotas last victory in San Antonio was April 17, 2013, when Wiggins was a high school senior. The Timberwolves overcame a charge fueled in large part by second-year player Lonnie Walker IV to hand the Spurs their fifth straight home loss. Walker has received limited playing time this season but the made the most of a season-high 13 minutes. Lonnie was fantastic, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. He has kept himself ready and we gave him a shot to play tonight and obviously he was up to the challenge. He did a really good job. But it wasnt enough to stop the Spurs from losing their second straight and 12th in 14 games. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points and DeMar DeRozan added 20 for the Spurs (6-13). Walker added 11, all in the second half. Minnesota had a season-high 18 3-pointers, shooting 45% on 3s. San Antonio was 5 for 29 on 3-pointers in comparison. Just getting caught in rotation, not helping the next man, DeRozan said of the defensive issues. Weve got to be there for one another. Guys are too good in the league just to depend on one guy to stop one guy on a team. The Timberwolves (10-8) led by as many as 13 points but had to fight off a rally that bridged the third and fourth quarters. Minnesota was assessed three technical fouls for arguing with officials in a one-minute span in the third quarter. Robert Covington was given the first with 6:48 remaining in the third, followed 48 seconds later by Towns. A third was given to the teams bench with 5:47 left. Walker fueled the momentum when he entered with 4:36 to go in the third quarter. Walker sank a 3-pointer and followed with a driving layup to pull San Antonio within 75-72. Walker would score nine points in the quarter on 4-for-5 shooting. Just energy, Walker said. Doing what Pop tells me to do. Be a defensive stopper, play the best I can and just the run the floor. Just be an energy guy. A layup by Walker and consecutive buckets by DeRozan put the Spurs up 92-91 with 5:56 remaining, their first lead since the end of the first quarter. Minnesota responded with a seven-point run to quiet the crowd and regain control. We just stayed composed, Wiggins said. We didnt let anyone faze us. Its always tough to play here, so we had to stay true to ourselves and execute. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota rookie Jarrett Culver, who attended Texas Tech, received a hearty ovation during pregame introductions. Culver made his eighth start in 18 games.  Trevor Graham limped off the court with 8:19 remaining in the game and did not return. Graham, who was listed as probable with a bruised left forearm, had three points and two rebounds in 13 minutes.  Josh Okogie, who was listed as probable with a sore left foot, had 11 points in 24 minutes.  Shabazz Napier missed the game with a strained right hamstring. Spurs: Aldridge has 18,958 points, passing Hall of Famer Scottie Pippens 18,941 career total for 59th on the leagues scoring list.  Center Chimezie Metu missed the game with a sore left foot. Metu, in his second year out of USC, is averaging 2.7 points in 3.7 minutes in six appearances this season.  San Antonio is 4-6 at home this season. The Spurs last home victory was Nov. 7 against Oklahoma City.  Walkers career high is 16 points, which he scored against Denver on April 3. SOCIAL OUTCAST DeRozan recently deleted all his Instagram posts, fueling speculation that he was unhappy with the Spurs and that he is on the verge of being traded. DeRozan said its all nothing. I dont even like social media, honestly, DeRozan said. Im not a big fan of social media, never been. To this day I always wish I had played in the 90s so I wouldnt deal with social media. I just let people talk. Me, personally, I hate it. So, there is nothing anyone should read into deleting the posts? I hate it, DeRozan reiterated. If it wasnt a need in 2019, I wouldnt have it.","401160904"
"PHOENIX --  A night after playing one of their worst games of the season, the Washington Wizards responded with one of their best. Players credited coach Scott Brooks with an impromptu breakfast meeting that led to a 140-132 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. ""It's the first time he's done it all year,"" Washington guard Bradley Beal said. ""It was definitely needed for everybody. It was a point of emphasis on just winning games and what it takes to win games. ""He did a good job of teaching and breaking down what he expects from everyone. That's what we needed. We got a good result tonight."" Beal scored 35 points, Thomas Bryant added 23 and the Wizards held off a late Phoenix rally to win the second game of their four-game trip. Washington bounced back from a 13-point loss at Denver on Tuesday by shooting 57% from the field and making 19 of 35 3-pointers. ""You grow up day by day, 24 hours at a time,"" Brooks said. ""We always want to expedite that as fast as we can, but it's about growing each day."" Phoenix fell below .500 -- at 8-9 -- for the first time this season. Devin Booker led the Suns with 27 points and eight players scored in double figures, but they couldn't contain the Wizards on a consistent basis. ""I told our guys this is a major test for us, of our character, integrity and togetherness,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""About a week and a half ago everybody was excited and there was a buzz, and that's died down. Now we have to stand up and be good teammates and do all the stuff we talk about when we're in practice, and I believe we will."" Washington led 74-69 at halftime after both teams made just about everything they threw toward the basket. The Wizards' backups scored 43 of those 74, including 14 from Ish Smith, the former Suns guard who finished with 21. The Wizards scored 10 points in the first 1:33 of the third quarter to continue the onslaught and led 108-95 after three quarters. Phoenix cut it to 124-120 with about 3 minutes left before Beal made two free throws to stop the rally. Isaiah Thomas, another former Suns guard, made a 3-pointer on the next possession to push the advantage back to nine. The Suns have lost five of six games after starting the season with a surprising 7-4 record. ""We are not one of those teams that can just turn it on and finish a game,"" Booker said. ""We came close to it and cut it to four but if we do that work early we will be in a better position throughout the whole game."" Beal shot 11 of 18 from the field and added six assists. Bryant shot 9 of 11, including 2 of 2 from 3-point range. BIG BENCH Washington's bench had a productive night with 59 points. Smith led the way with 21 while Davis Bertans had 16 and Jordan McRae and Moritz Wagner both added 11. That group played a big chunk of the second quarter when the Wizards poured in 38 points. ""We pride ourselves on going out there and playing hard,"" McRae said. ""The second unit has to really move the ball and get after people defensively."" BRIGHT SPOT One encouraging development for the Suns is the improved play of forward Cheick Diallo, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes off the bench. He shot 7 of 8 from the field. With Deandre Ayton suspended and Aron Baynes hurt, Diallo been forced into a bigger role and responded. ""He's about the only guy we have right now that can catch the ball and try to finish with some intensity about the rim,"" Williams said. TIP-INS Wizards: Guard C.J. Miles hurt his left wrist in the loss to the Nuggets. Brooks said he won't play the rest of the road trip and the results of his MRI should be available soon. Suns: Ayton missed the 16th game of his 25-game suspension for violating the league's drug policy after testing positive for a diuretic. He'll be eligible to return against the Clippers on Dec. 17. ... Baynes missed the game with a right hip flexor strain.","401160905"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis shrugged off a constant cascade of boos and reminded a packed crowd exactly what it lost when the six-time All-Stars trade request was finally fulfilled. Davis capped a 41-point performance in his return to New Orleans by intercepting Jrue Holidays inbounds pass with 5 seconds left and making a pair of game-sealing free throws, and the Los Angeles Lakers extended their winning streak to nine with a 114-110 victory over the Pelicans on Wednesday night. Obviously, the emotions was high, Davis said. I think this game was circled on both calendars. And they came out guns blazing and we were able to come out with the win. An energetic crowd booed Davis during introductions and virtually every time he handled the ball, only to see him and new teammate LeBron James take over in the fourth quarter. James had 29 points and 11 assists, scoring 15 points in the final period, when Kyle Kuzma added nine of his 16 points to help the Lakers erase a 10-point deficit. My teammates kept telling me, AD, dont worry about it. Were going to get this win. Well find a way to win it for you, said Davis, who spent his first seven years in New Orleans. Kuzma gave the Lakers the lead for good when he hit a 3-pointer from the left corner with 1:07 to go, making it 111-109. New Orleans trimmed it to 111-110 when Josh Hart hit one of two free throws, and after a turnover by James as he was swarmed in the paint, JJ Redicks open 3 for the lead rimmed out. The Pelicans were forced to foul Davis, who missed one of two free throws, giving the Pelicans 5 seconds to run a play for the tie or lead. But thats when Davis sealed it, stepping in front of Brandon Ingram for his third steal. We were going to try to run JJ off a screen and back off, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. If not, we were going to try to get the ball to Brandon to try and dribble and create something. AD just made a great defensive play. Holiday had 29 points and 12 assists, and Ingram had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who have lost three straight. It was a great atmosphere. I thought the energy was our way, Holiday said. Toward the end of the game we had some execution issues, but we still gave ourselves a chance. After trailing by 16 in the third quarter, the Lakers seized momentum with a 9-0 run to open the fourth, trimming New Orleans lead to 89-88. Los Angeles tied the game at 91 on Kuzmas third 3. New Orleans briefly went back up by four before Davis, whod received treatment after banging his right elbow at the end of the third quarter, returned to the game and threw down an alley-oop feed from James. Any time you go back to a place where youve made a mark, where you started your career ... and gave a lot to the community and the franchise, you want to come back and play well and win, James said. We knew that as his brothers and we wanted to try and fulfill that goal. The Lakers took their first lead since the opening five minutes of the game when James hit a jumper over Ingram, pulling up as the Pelicans forward glanced over his shoulder to see if a screen was being set. Its just winning time for me, James said. Fourth quarter, no matter how much of a deficit were in, or however the game is going, I believe once I start the fourth I can make a push and see what happens. Davis missed his first shot and three of his first four to the delight of the crowd, but still scored 27 points by halftime on his way to the most points by a player in his first game against his former team, according to Elias. It was a tough environment. Every time he touched the basketball, he was going against a guy -- a bunch of guys -- that know him, playing against a coach that knows him, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. He put all that stuff aside. Blocked out the noise and rose to the challenge. Davis executed about every move New Orleans fans knew and loved when he wore the No. 23 in blue, red and gold, from soaring alley-oop dunks to turnaround baseline fades. Only this time, he wore a gold jersey with a purple No. 3, and it was his misses that drew roars from the crowd. The Pelicans appeared buoyed by the partisan energy permeating the arena, going up 38-25 on Holidays step-back 3 as the first quarter expired. New Orleans led 64-54 at halftime, thanks in large part to Holidays 10-of-15 shooting to that point, including his 4-of-4 mark from 3-point range. And the Pelicans maintained a double-digit lead until early in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: Shot 8 of 24 from 3-point range and missed seven of 25 free throws. ... Scored 62 points in the paint. ... Dwight Howard had nine points on four dunks and a free throw. Pelicans: Turned the ball over 20 times, leading to 19 Lakers points. ... Shot 17 of 40 (42.5%) from 3-point range. ... Redick made five 3s and finished with 18 points. ... Kenrich Williams scored 11 points. CATCHING UP Before Davis changed out of his uniform, he went to the Pelicans locker room to give Holiday a signed jersey and wound up lingering a bit to catch up with old teammates and coaches. Weve got a bond off the floor that will continue no matter the circumstances. It was a fun night, Davis said. Everybody thinks Ive got a vendetta against New Orleans or something like that. ... I have no ill will toward anybody. Im in a happy place. Theyre in a happy place. And were just here to play basketball.","401160906"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Carmelo Anthony is feeling more at home with the Portland Trail Blazers, especially now that hes seen the appreciation of the hometown fans. With the crowd chanting his name, Anthony finished with 19 points in his Moda Center home debut Wednesday night and the Blazers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 136-119. Damian Lillard had 27 points and Hassan Whiteside added 21 points and 16 rebounds for the Blazers, who led by as many as 35 points in their return home after an extended 2-4 road trip. Anthonys dunk early in the fourth quarter gave Portland a 111-79 lead and put the crowd on its feet. When he was subbed out for the last time a couple of minutes later, fans chanted Melo! Melo! The reception isnt the only thing making Anthony feel at home. He seems to be more comfortable with his new team, too. I think guys are just starting to feel a little bit more relaxed and at ease, Anthony said. When I first got here last week, and met those guys in New Orleans, I think it was the hype of the excitement of me coming to the team, guys not really knowing how this was going play out, how this was going to fit in, how I was going to fit in. The Blazers signed Anthony in hopes he could help the team overcome a slow start after going to the Western Conference finals last season. The deal was official Nov. 19, in the midst of Portlands six-game road trip. The 10-time All-Star played in four games before the team returned to Portland, averaging 16 points and nearly 30 minutes per game. He led the Blazers with 25 points in a 117-94 victory at Chicago on Monday night that snapped a four-game losing streak. Before signing with the Blazers, Anthony hadnt played since a 10-game stint with the Houston Rockets ended a little more than a year ago. Honestly, I didnt know what to expect, Anthony said. I wanted to come in, just play basketball and find my joy again, and the excitement of playing basketball, what it should be. Ive found that early on so far. Ive found that happiness, that joy, in the way the guys were able to open this up to me with open arms and bring me in here as one of their own. Abdel Nader had 23 points off the bench for Oklahoma City, and Chris Paul finished with 16 points. Melo's tough. Especially on that mid post where hes built a career, Paul said. Hes one of the best to ever play right there so I love defending him. That's my brother right there. We went to dinner last night. I always want to see him do well, except against us. The Thunder were coming off their first road win of the season, a 100-97 victory over Golden State on Monday night that snapped a three-game losing streak. Portland raced to a 40-17 lead and it wasnt close the rest of the way. The Blazers made their first six attempts from the perimeter and finished with 14 3s. Lillard led the team with five 3-pointers. The Blazers led 63-50 at the half. It ended on a contentious note when it appeared that Steven Adams hooked Lillard by the neck but wasnt called for the foul. Lillard complained to the ref, but Anthony spirited him away and toward the tunnel. Whiteside had 19 points and 12 rebounds at the break. There was more of the same in the third quarter, with the Blazers maintaining a double-digit lead. Portland went into the fourth quarter up 104-77. TIP INS Thunder: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander announced on Twitter that he has committed to play for team Canada in its bid to get to the Tokyo Olympics next year. ... Guard Hamidou Diallo missed his second game with a hyperextension sprain in his right elbow. He is expected to be out from four to six weeks. Trail Blazers: Gary Trent Jr. was held out of the game because of a hamstring injury. ... The Blazers 42 first-quarter points were a season high. ... Rodney Hood made all four shots he took from the field in the first half, including three 3-pointers. ... All of Portlands starters finished in double figures. HOME COOKIN The Blazers will play nine of their next 12 games at home, which the team was embracing after playing 13 of the first 18 on the road. We just didnt play good enough to win a lot of those games. But knowing that were coming home and that were playing better, I think its on everybodys mind like, `OK, its a great opportunity for us to kind of get ourselves back into it taking care of our home floor. Lillard said. Even though we havent been great at home, at some point it has to turn because our work has continued, weve been positive, and we continue to believe in ourselves, so I think were starting to turn that corner.","401160907"
"Draymond Green jokes about coach Steve Kerr bloodying his hand by breaking a clipboard but says it clearly turned the team's play around. (0:39) SAN FRANCISCO --  Another healthy body sure helped the Golden State Warriors, especially when that guy coming back was Draymond Green -- an emotional, vocal leader of this young group who brings it on both ends. Eric Paschall scored 25 points and the Warriors emphatically closed out a tight game after their failure two days earlier, holding off the Chicago Bulls 104-90 on Wednesday night for just their second win at new Chase Center. ""Having Draymond back was a big deal. He settled us down,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Having nine instead of eight, it matters. You just have more to work with and more options."" The latest injury news for the Warriors involved their coach. Kerr cut his right hand breaking a clipboard. It happens at least once a season. ""It's a mere flesh wound. I broke a clipboard. It's one of two. I'm allotted two a year. This was No. 1,"" Kerr said. ""It always cuts in the same place. This was a little deeper one, I was a little more upset. I'm day to day. No stitches yet but we'll see tomorrow."" Blood on the clipboard told players their coach was hurt. ""He's writing a play up and he's actively wiping blood up off the clipboard,"" Omari Spellman said. Alec Burks added 23 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in just the second win in 12 games for Golden State, which squandered a late lead Monday night in losing 100-97 to Oklahoma City while allowing the Thunder to score the game's final 13 points. The Warriors snapped a three-game losing streak. Green returned from a three-game absence because of a sore right heel and contributed seven points, eight assists and five rebounds in nearly 24 minutes. Zach LaVine had 36 points, five rebounds and five assists for the Bulls, who now will try to avenge a 117-94 home loss to the Trail Blazers on Monday night when they travel to Portland to play Friday. Golden State struggled to take care of the ball or make stops down the stretch against Oklahoma City, then worked to be the aggressor in this game. The Warriors jumped in the passing lanes on defense to create transition baskets and plays like Paschall's timely dunk that put his team ahead 88-83 with 5:17 remaining. The Bulls shot 16 for 44 in the first half to trail 53-48 at the break. Spellman wound up with 13 points, 11 rebounds and three blocked shots off the bench for his fifth career double-double and first with the Warriors. ""I'm just happy to bring the energy for this team,"" he said. Bulls forward Chandler Hutchison, sidelined for two games last week with soreness in his shins, was in the starting lineup but played only two minutes, not a great sign one game after he came back to score six points and grab three rebounds in seven minutes late in the loss to Portland. TIP-INS Bulls: F Luke Kornet played 10 minutes in his return from an eight-game absence following sinus surgery. ... G Ryan Arcidiacono played after he was a game-time decision with a sprained right elbow. ... The Bulls are now 1-1 on the road vs. the Western Conference. ... G Otto Porter Jr. missed his 10th consecutive game with a bone bruise in his left foot. ... Chicago has been swept in the past two season series vs. Golden State.

The Warriors are 2-7 at home. SIDELINE KLAY Klay Thompson is sidelined recovering from knee surgery and got to work the sideline. The Splash Brother served as a sideline reporter in the second quarter from a table off the end of Golden State's bench, a new gig for the All-Star guard. General manager Bob Myers, using the foam roller on a mat in the weight room, inquired to Thompson when he entered the locker room. ""Hey Klay, you ready for sideline tonight?"" Thompson: ""Yeah, I'm dropping knowledge."" Before his stint began, he took time to sign a quick autograph, then sat down and settled in as if in his element -- sporting a big grin. He even spontaneously took over some of the postgame work interviewing Spellman, who said, ""Klay's hilarious, it was hard not to laugh."" Thompson had surgery July 2 for a torn ACL in his left knee that he injured in Game 6 of the NBA Finals, when the Toronto Raptors won to clinch the franchise's first championship. 3-POINT STAT The Warriors went 11 for 29 from 3-point range to the Bulls' 10 of 29. QUOTEABLE Bulls coach Jim Boylen on the Warriors: ""The names maybe have changed but their spirit, their soul and the way they play, the way they compete I don't think has changed at all. So give them a lot of credit for that.""","401160908"
"NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving is getting closer to a return, and at some point he will face his former team. When he does, the Brooklyn Nets can only hope he plays as well as Spencer Dinwiddie. Dinwiddie had 32 points and 11 assists while Irving remained sidelined, and the Nets beat the Boston Celtics 112-107 on Friday to split a home-and-home series. Irving missed his eighth straight game with a right shoulder injury but was at the arena to get an evaluation and watch from the bench along with Kevin Durant. Coach Kenny Atkinson said afterward that the All-Star point guard has started work on the court and would miss one more game before potentially being ready to rejoin a team that has done well in his absence thanks to Dinwiddie's strong performances. ""When Kyrie comes back I think that's just going to give us a team with more depth, a more powerful team. But listen, he's playing as good as anybody in the NBA right now in my humble opinion,"" Atkinson said of Dinwiddie. The Eastern Conference player of the week last week matched his highest assist total of the season and was two shy of his best scoring performance of the season. ""The role's completely different so obviously there's a change there,"" Dinwiddie said. ""My approach to the game is very similar either way, so whatever the team needs to win and then the role kind of dictates what that is."" Jarrett Allen added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets, who bounced back from their 121-110 loss in Boston on Wednesday to win for the fifth time in six games. Jayson Tatum had 26 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who had won two straight. Kemba Walker finished with 17 points and six assists, but the Nets handled Irving's replacement much better this time after he scored a season-high 39 points Wednesday. Boston coach Brad Stevens talked about the importance of a strong start with the early tip, but the Celtics couldn't deliver it. They were called for a double dribble and a 3-second violation during a six-turnover first quarter, when the Nets opened a 14-point lead. Boston was much sharper in the second, with Tatum making four 3-pointers, including one that cut it to 58-55 at halftime. The Nets extended it back to 14 in the third when Dinwiddie hit his second straight 3-pointer, but Boston got it back down to 87-81 by the end of the period. Again, Brooklyn pushed it back to double digits in the fourth and held on after Boston cut it to four in the final minute. ""It was too late,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""We tried to turn it on too late and it burned us in the end."" TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum was 4 for 8 from 3-point range after going 0 for 11 in his previous three games. ... Marcus Smart scored 15 points. ... The Celtics will remain in New York before visiting the Knicks on Sunday. Nets: DeAndre Jordan had eight points and 11 rebounds after missing two games with left ankle soreness. ... Taurean Prince scored 16 points. ... The Nets finished 9-6 this month, their first winning November since going 11-4 in 2012, their first full month in Brooklyn. MORE ON KYRIE Two days after Celtics fans taunted Irving even in his absence, and he responded with a long Instagram post saying sports and entertainment were ""ignorant and obtrusive."", a group of Nets fans chanted ""Kyrie's better! Kyrie's better!"" when Walker shot free throws. None of the anger in Boston toward Irving is coming from Stevens. ""I like Kyrie, I appreciated Kyrie, wished him well and I think that him coming home has been something that he wanted to do and he was a free agent,"" Stevens said. ""You get to make that choice and we can't do anything but respect that and be happy for him."" NEW LOOK The Nets debuted their uniforms in tribute to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of the borough that was home to The Notorious B.I.G. The white uniforms say Bed-Stuy across the front, with a camouflage pattern along the sides of the jerseys and shorts. The Nets plan to wear them 28 times this season.","401160909"
"DETROIT --  Langston Galloways shot from around midcourt sailed toward the basket, representing Detroits last hope to force overtime in another tight game against Charlotte. It looked good, Hornets coach James Borrego said. It looked good, but I think we played the play the right way. We did all we could. Galloways shot rimmed out at the buzzer, and Charlotte held on for a 110-107 victory over the Pistons on Friday night. The Hornets completed a home-and-home sweep of Detroit this week. The Pistons must be wondering what they have to do to beat the Hornets. Charlotte edged the Pistons 109-106 earlier in the month and 102-101 on Wednesday night. The Hornets have won nine straight over Detroit. I dont really buy into streaks like that, I guess, Charlotte forward Marvin Williams said. The NBA, its difficult to win a game. Sometimes youll play against a team thats just kind of a little different matchup for you. The Hornets rallied from an eight-point deficit in the final quarter and led by three with 8.9 seconds left. Detroit inbounded the ball, and Luke Kennard missed a 3-pointer from near the top of the key. Galloway was able to run down the loose ball, and his last-ditch shot looked on line, but it wouldnt go in. We are putting ourselves in position to win, we just have to get thought in the game, and execution in the fourth quarter and down the stretch, Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. P.J. Washington scored 26 points for Charlotte, and Terry Rozier added 23. The Hornets were without center Cody Zeller because of a left hip injury. Derrick Rose led the Pistons with 23 points. With the score tied at 95, Galloway got a very friendly bounce off the rim when he sank a 3-pointer while being fouled. That four-point play started an 8-0 run, but Charlotte rallied. Devonte Graham put the Hornets up 108-106 with a 3-pointer -- the Hornets went 19 of 38 from beyond the arc. Blake Griffin had a chance to tie it with 1:29 remaining, but he made just one of two free throws, and the Pistons didnt score again. Detroit finished 10 of 20 from the line. NEXT MAN UP In Zellers absence, Bismack Biyombo has started the last two games for Charlotte. He had 19 points and nine rebounds Wednesday, then contributed 13 points and nine rebounds Friday. He ignites our defense. He makes us better on that end of the floor, Borrego said. Our commitment to protecting the paint, keeping the ball in front -- and hes given us a tremendous amount offensively as well. His ability to run the floor, play with pace, rolling to the bucket, finishing big shots around the rim, tipping balls out, offensive rebounding. STRONG START Rozier made his first five 3-point attempts and scored 17 points in the first half. Kennard helped the Pistons mostly keep pace, making four 3s of his own in the first quarter. The teams combined to make 21 3-pointers in the first half, the most in a first half in any NBA game this season. The Hornets led 62-57. I thought we started off bad defensively, Kennard said. We started out and had thirty-something points in the first quarter and we were still losing at the end of the first. So, weve got to figure something out. TIP-INS Hornets: Miles Bridges scored 16 points in front of a crowd that included Tom Izzo, his coach at Michigan State. Pistons: The Pistons were without G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction). ... Detroit was called for its second delay of game violation at the start of the second half, so the third quarter began with a technical foul free throw for Charlotte, which Rozier made.","401160910"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Toronto Raptors weren't getting shots to fall. So they concentrated on defense and waited for somebody to get hot. Norman Powell delivered in the third quarter, scoring 19 of his career-best 33 points and the Raptors won their sixth straight game, beating the Orlando Magic 90-83 on Friday night. ""Sometimes a guy just finds a groove in the middle of the game when nobody else has any flow going,"" said Fred Van Fleet, who added 22 points for the Raptors. ""So you want to ride that out as long as you can. Norm took over the offense by himself."" Powell was 7-for-9 shooting in the third quarter, including three 3-pointers. He said he was just reacting to the Raptors' seven-point halftime deficit, the result of 31% shooting that included 5 of 24 from 3-point range. ""You stay in the moment and let plays come to you, continue to shoot and live with the result,"" Powell said. ""Everybody is being really tied into what we are doing (defensively), how we are changing defenses, where we need to be, helping one another, talking, communicating, coming out of timeouts. When we see where an adjustment needs to be made, we were able to pick it up in the second half."" The Raptors won despite 4-for-22 shooting by Pascal Siakam, the NBA's ninth-leading scorer. Siakam finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 19 points for Orlando, which has lost four of five. Markelle Fultz added 15 points. Aaron Gordon, who played 32 minutes for Orlando after missing three games with a right ankle contusion, had eight points and eight rebounds. The Magic shot 35% for the game and had 24 turnovers. ""You're just not going to beat a team that good turning the ball over that much,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""They help early, they're great with their hands, you take the extra dribble and it's gone. The majority of (the turnovers) were that."" The Magic led by 11 twice in the first half. Van Fleet hit a pair of 3-pointers that helped the Raptors cut Orlando's lead to 47-40 by halftime. But he second half was all Toronto, and especially Powell. ""We had a stretch of 12 consecutive stops in the third quarter,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""That's about as high as it gets. It was excellent. We didn't shoot the ball well, we didn't play well. I was happy when we got to the locker room only down seven."" Powell scored Toronto's first 10 points in the second half, eight as part of a 13-0 run that gave the Raptors a 60-53 lead late in the third quarter. Powell's final 3-pointer gave Toronto an 83-72 lead, their largest of the game, with less than three minutes left.

"CLEVELAND -- Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 11 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and the Milwaukee Bucks held off the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-110 on Friday night for their 10th consecutive victory. Cleveland trailed 74-52 early in the third quarter, but hit 10 3-pointers in the period and cut the lead into single figures. The Cavaliers continued to rally and Kevin Love's layup made it 113-110 with 2 minutes, 20 seconds left -- Cleveland's final points of the game. Khris Middleton's jumper and two free throws by George Hill put the game away, but Antetokounmpo was once again the difference-maker. The reigning MVP scored in a variety of ways with the game on the line, including a 3-pointer, a floating jumper, a tip-in and a dunk off an offensive rebound. Cleveland got back in it with Antetokounmpo taking a rest in the third quarter. The Cavaliers had 42 points, their highest-scoring quarter of the season. Antetokounmpo grabbed 12 rebounds and has had double-doubles in every game this season for Milwaukee, at 16-3 the top team in the Eastern Conference. The Bucks hadn't won 10 in a row since the 1985-86 season. Hill scored 18 points and Middleton, playing for the second time since missing seven games with a bruised left thigh, had 12. Cleveland has dropped nine of 10. Rookie Darius Garland scored 21 points, including five 3-pointers, and Cedi Osman had 20. Tristan Thompson had 11 points and 13 rebounds, including the 5,000th of his career in the first half. Love, who is playing despite dealing with a sore back, had 16 points and 8 rebounds in 31 minutes. Antetokounmpo was 14-of-26 from the field and took charge after Milwaukee won the opening tip. He cut to the basket, took a bounce pass from Eric Bledsoe, dunked with his right hand over Love and completed the three-point play at the foul line. Antetokounmpo's dunk came just 13 seconds into the game. Love, who came over to help after Antetokounmpo evaded his defender, leaped to block the attempt but was whistled for the foul. Love missed games Saturday and Monday, and was limited to 24 minutes Wednesday. TIP-INS Bucks: The record for most consecutive double-doubles to start an NBA season is 34, set by Bill Walton in 1977. ... Hill (sore back) returned after missing two games.

"NEW YORK --  Philadelphia coach Brett Brown made a case for why Ben Simmons should be considered for a spot on the NBAs All-Defensive team before Fridays game in New York. Simmons went out and backed Browns talk with a pair of steals in the second half, including a game-clinching play down the stretch for the short-handed 76ers. Joel Embiid had 27 points and 17 rebounds, James Ennis III scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half, and Philadelphia overcame a sluggish start and beat the Knicks 101-95. The league better pay attention to him defensively, Brown said of Simmons. How can he not be discussed amongst the leagues better defensive players? He guards five men, point guards, twos and threes. Hes kind of a Swizz army knife in that regard. Tobias Harris scored 19, and Simmons chipped in 16 points for the 76ers, who have won two straight and six of seven. Julius Randle had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Marcus Morris Sr. scored 20 points for the Knicks, who have lost a season-high five straight. The Knicks, who have lost their two meetings this season against the 76ers, went 19 for 33 from the free-throw line. At the end of the day, youve got a guy like Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons out there, thats why they make the big bucks, New York coach David Fizdale said. Those guys are closers. You just cant miss 14 free throws against a team like that. The 76ers were playing without starters Al Horford (rest) and Josh Richardson (right hamstring injury) and it showed in the first half as their offense struggled. Philadelphia shot 13 for 38 from the field, including 2 for 18 behind the 3-point line. But the Sixers rallied from a 51-39 halftime deficit, cutting the lead to 56-52 with 8:03 to play in the third quarter when Simmons intercepted Julius Randles inbound pass off a time out and raced down the court for a dunk. Philadelphia then outscored the Knicks 16-11 over the final seven minutes of the third quarter for a 70-68 lead entering the final quarter. The Knicks offense sputtered, going 0 for 9 with two turnovers down the stretch in the third. Philadelphia went on a 9-3 run, capped by former Knick Trey Burkes basket that made it 79-73. Harris increased the 76ers' lead 94-89 with 1:19 left in regulation, forcing a Knicks timeout. Simmons, who entered play second behind former teammate Jimmy Butler with 2.25 steals per game, picked off an inbound pass from Frank Ntilikina and dunked to extend the lead 96-89 and hold off the Knicks. Finding their offensive rhythm, Simmons said, would allow their offense to be on par with their defensive effort and avoid future starts like the one they encountered at Madison Square Garden against one of the leagues worst teams. We got to know what we are good at, what we are great at, and whats working us, he said. With this team, moving the ball, posting up, slashing, cutting and finding guys on the perimeter is what works. The Knicks jumped out to a 23-9 lead on consecutive baskets from Barrett in the opening period. A 3-pointer from reserve Damyean Dotson made it 31-18 to close out the first. New York led by as many as 16 points in the second after Philadelphia coach Brett Brown picked up a technical foul after question a foul call on Simmons. Marcus Morris Sr. hit the technical free throw and Randle was perfect on his two free throws, extending an 8-0 run to make it 51-35. TIPS INS: 76ers: C/F Horford was held out due to rest. ... G Richardson did not play because of tightness in his right hamstring. Knicks: RJ Barrett had 18 points. NEXT MAN UP: Missing Richardsons 16.1 points and Horfords 14.4 points meant Brown had to reach into his bench to make up the difference and backup forward Ennis III certainly did not disappoint. Ennis III went 3 for 4 from the 3-point line and was perfect on his nine free throws over 22 minutes after totaling just 24 minutes in his last two games. His play was key late in the third quarter as the 76ers rallied. He contributed eight points during a 9-2 run to close out the period. I mean in this whole locker room he has a respect level with the way that he plays and how hard he plays and tonight it was coming to fruition in a high-volume way, Harris said. But we dont come out of here with this win today without him, his effort.","401160913"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- When the Indiana Pacers finally asserted themselves after a sluggish half, the Atlanta Hawks' Trae Young continually made shots to remind Indy that nothing would be easy. Young tied a career high with 49 points, but the host Pacers overcame an 11-point halftime deficit as well as being pushed an extra five minutes for a 105-104 overtime triumph over the Hawks on Friday night. T.J. Warren hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:13 remaining for the Pacers, and Jeremy Lamb had 20 points and sparked a quick start in overtime with a 20-foot jumper and an assist on a Myles Turner 3-pointer. ""It was just a little adversity,"" Turner said. ""I feel like we faced it well."" But back came the Hawks, trying to avoid a ninth consecutive loss, as Young scored eight of his team's 10 points in overtime, including a pair of 3-pointers. ""I guess it was good individually,"" Young said, ""but people who know me know I don't care at all. If we don't win, none of that matters. I didn't do enough."" Young's 49 points tied for the fourth-highest, single-game total in Bankers Life Fieldhouse history. He finished 16 of 28 from the floor, hitting 8 of 15 on 3-pointers. ""The head of the snake, Trae Young, he was great tonight,"" Lamb said. ""He was great, but we were able to get enough stops."" Warren's only 3-pointer broke a 99-all tie. He finished with 16 points. ""We just kept grinding and finally got the lead late,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""They found a way to get this game."" After two quarters, McMillan was scratching his head with the Pacers trailing 54-43. ""I was thinking it was too much turkey,"" he said. ""We looked asleep in the first half."" Turner, who along with Domantas Sabonis scored 17 points, sensed his team would respond based on how they've played recently. ""These past couple of games, we've started to come together a lot more,"" he said. ""We came back and responded well."" Warren and Malcomb Brogdon had 16. Brogdon had a chance to win the game in regulation but his last-second bank shot was long. The Hawks' DeAndre' Bembry and Alex Len added 15 points apiece off the bench. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce wishes his team had the balance of the Pacers. Aside from Young, the rest of the Hawks shot just 35.6 percent (23 of 63). ""We needed every bit of (Young's), whatever number, 49, 48, whatever he ended up with, we needed every bit of that,"" Pierce said. ""However, we've got to balance that. We were playing him heavy minutes.""

"MIAMI --  A big lead had almost entirely slipped away, and the Miami Heat showed no sense of panic. With good reason. A 27-8 third-quarter run allowed the Heat to pull away and beat the Golden State Warriors 122-105 on Friday night. Goran Dragic scored 20 points, Tyler Herro added 19 and the Heat remained perfect at home -- 8-0, tying the franchise's best home start to a season. ""Being able to weather the storm is big,"" Herro said. ""It's a game of runs."" Duncan Robinson scored 17 for Miami. Robinson and Herro were a combined 10 for 13 from 3-point range. Jimmy Butler scored 16, while Kendrick Nunn -- who was with the Warriors' G League team last year -- and Kelly Olynyk each had 15 for the Heat. ""We're trying to build a consistent game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Jordan Poole scored 20 for injury-ravaged Golden State, which was playing the opener of a five-game road trip. Eric Paschall scored 17 and Alec Burks finished with 16 for the Warriors. The Warriors are one of four teams without back-to-back wins this season, joining Chicago, Detroit and New York. They were down 20 after the first quarter, then clawed within 13 by halftime and eventually as little as six midway through the third quarter -- before Miami recovered to put the game away with the 27-8 run over an eight-minute stretch. Draymond Green played only 19 minutes for Golden State, and Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he'll be on a minutes restriction going forward. The Warriors' injury woes -- no Stephen Curry, no Klay Thompson, no D'Angelo Russell and more -- have left them an NBA-worst 4-16. ""We're obviously playing for the future, playing for next year and he needs to be out on the floor to help guide these young players,"" Kerr said. ""I know he wants to be out on the floor. So we've got to find the balance between allowing him to make his impact with this team and not wearing him down at the same time."" Miami's lead was 82-75 after Poole made a pair of free throws with 4:37 left in the third. That's when the Heat took off, Herro connecting on a 30-footer to end the big run and give Miami a 109-83 lead with 8:40 left. It was the third home game this season that Miami has won without trailing. Opponents have led for 29:54 of a possible 384 minutes on the Heat home floor -- just 7.8% of the time. The Heat have led for 339 of those minutes. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State lost the first quarter 41-21 and has been outscored by 20 or more points in the opening period three times in its last 17 games. Before that, it happened three times in a span of 1,102 Warriors' regular-season contests. ... Kevon Looney (neuropathy) missed his 19th consecutive game, but the Warriors hope to have him back as early as Monday's game in Atlanta. Heat: Miami has led by at least 15 points in all eight of its home games -- and didn't take long to extend that streak Friday, opening the game on a 21-6 run. ... This was the 10th and final game of Dion Waiters' suspension for conduct detrimental to the team, but the Heat have not revealed what's next. A conditioning period seems possible, and it's unclear if Waiters will fly with the team Saturday to start a three-game trip. ONLY TWO Of the 10 players on the court last season when Dwyane Wade made a desperation 3-pointer with no time left to beat the Warriors, only two played Friday. For the Warriors, Kevin Durant is in Brooklyn, Andre Iguodala is technically with Memphis, Jordan Bell is with Minnesota, and Curry and Thompson are injured. For the Heat, Waiters is suspended, Josh Richardson is with Philadelphia and Wade is retired. That leaves Kelly Olynyk and Justise Winslow, who played off Miami's bench. 70, AGAIN Miami had 71 points in the first half, making this the first month in team history with three games at least 70 by intermission. The others: a franchise-record-tying 75 against Cleveland on Nov. 20, and 71 against Houston on Nov. 3.","401160915"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Utah coach Quin Snyder didnt have a lot to say to his team at halftime, despite a 15-point deficit. A little video session, but no harsh words or motivational speeches. The low-key tactic worked well. The Jazz came out quickly in the third, eventually erased the Memphis Grizzlies double-digit lead and pulled away for a 103-94 victory Friday night to snap a two-game skid. Bojan Bogdanovic was key in the fourth quarter, scoring 16 of his 33 points in the game. Im glad we played the second half like we did, opposed to the first, Snyder said. We came out competitive and threw ourselves into the defense. We were struggling offensively in the first half and forgot about that and the offense came. Bogdanovic matched his season-high scoring mark, going 12 of 20 from the field, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range. Donovan Mitchell added 20 points despite a tough shooting night (7 of 22) and Rudy Gobert had 13 points, 13 rebounds and a pair of blocks. In the fourth, when the Jazz would routinely look to Mitchell, their leading scorer, they relied on Bogdanovic. It shows how unselfish we are, especially Donovan, Bogdanovic said. Our best player, hes supposed to take last shots in the last couple of minutes. ... He told me to take the last shots. Mitchell added that when it gets to a point, (Bogdanovic) locks in and knocks shots down. Its easy to just kind of run plays and give him the ball as much as possible. Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting. The Grizzlies have lost six straight. Memphis saw a 15-point halftime lead evaporate quickly as the Jazz scored the first 12 points of the third quarter, the Grizzlies going almost four minutes without scoring against a much more active Jazz defense. The run would reach 18-2, allowing Utah to retake the lead. The game would level into a tight contest the rest of the third. We didnt do what we need to do in the third quarter because we let them come out and punch us early, and we didnt respond, Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. said. Memphis would still be close near the midway point of the fourth, but couldnt keep pace with Bogdanovic and the rest of the Jazz. We have to play all four quarters like we did the first half, said rookie guard Ja Morant, who was limited to 11 points making only four of his 13 shots. It helped us get out to our biggest lead. We just have to do that all four quarters. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell had scored at least 25 points in six of his previous eight games before recording 20 against Memphis. ... F Ed Davis, who missed the previous 12 games with a left fibula fracture, played for the first time since Nov. 3, grabbing five rebounds despite not scoring. Bogdanovic also had 33 points on Nov. 8 against Milwaukee. Grizzlies: Valanciunas recorded his 11th double-double and his third straight. ... Memphis, which led by 15 in the game, blew a double-digit lead for the sixth time this season, most in the NBA, and the 15-point lead was the largest blown by Memphis this season. The starting backcourt of Morant and Dillon Brooks managed only 11 points each, converting 9 of 27 shots. Jackson had four blocks in the game, the final one marking the 100th block in his first 75 NBA games. RETRO NIGHT Both teams wore their throwback jerseys -- the Jazz in the purple, snow-capped mountain version; Memphis in it teal-based ones with a large G and S in Grizzlies. The team logos from about 20 years ago were used on the scoreboard and the Grizzly head with the claws around the red ball was the center court emblem. CONLEY ON THE BOARDS Former Grizzlies guard Mike Conley has struggled in his shooting this season as he adapts to his new team, but his rebounding numbers are up. He had seven rebounds, including a pair off the offensive glass. I couldnt make a shot, so I had to do something, Conley said.","401160916"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder kept battling. Dennis Schroder scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and had seven assists to help the Thunder beat the New Orleans Pelicans 109-104 on Friday night. Abdel Nader scored 19 points and Danilo Gallinari had 17 for Oklahoma City, which had been 1-4 in its previous five games. Steven Adams added 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder, including the final four points in the last minute. After losing their first seven games decided by five points or less, the Thunder have won two in a row. ""I thought it was a really good team win, just because a lot of guys stepped up and contributed,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""We did a fairly good job of closing the game out. I thought top to bottom, everybody that was out there really contributed in a big way."" Brandon Ingram had 26 points and eight rebounds to lead New Orleans. J.J. Redick added 16 points for the Pelicans but missed two 3-point attempts in the final 11 seconds. New Orleans, which trailed by as much as 16 midway through the second quarter and by nine at halftime, had seven players score in double digits. ""We got back into the game simply because we were moving the basketball and moving ourselves,"" said New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry. ""We've just got to get to a point where we're doing it for 48 minutes, not 45 and not 47. We've got to do that all the way until the end of the game."" The Thunder led until midway through the third quarter when New Orleans jumped on top with a 13-1 run. After the Pelicans pushed their lead to a game-high eight points at 92-84 on E'Twaun Moore's 3-pointer with 9:53 remaining, the Thunder responded with a 13-1 run to regain the edge. The teams exchanged leads three times down the stretch until New Orleans went ahead 104-103 with 2:48 left on Ingram's layup, but the Thunder scored the next six points. Chris Paul sank a short jumper with 1:24 to go, then Adams knocked home a rebound with 53.7 seconds left and put it away with an authoritative dunk with 15.1 seconds on the clock. The Pelicans missed their last six shots of the game. ""The energy was amazing. It was just probably our best team win of the year,"" Paul said. ""The biggest thing is that we never gave up and we closed out the game on defense. And I think once we continue to figure out that our defense can win more games for us than our offense, we'll be fine."" TIP-INS New Orleans: Kenrich Williams left after rolling his left ankle midway through the first quarter. Williams went down on the play and stayed down for a couple of minutes before being helped off the court. ... Ingram scored 12 points in the first quarter, zero in the second, 10 in the third and four in the fourth. He has not scored fewer than 21 points over his last nine games, dating back to a seven-point effort the last time these teams met, a 115-104 Thunder victory on Nov. 2. Oklahoma City: Paul entered averaging 16.2 points per game, but had just seven, on 3-of-9 shooting, including the basket that gave the Thunder the lead for good with 1:24 to go. He also had six assists and five rebounds. It was the fourth time this season Paul scored in single digits. ... Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entered averaging 18.8 points per game, but had just two at halftime and ended up with 10 points, his lowest output of the season. ... Adams scored 10 points in the game's opening 2:16, then was blanked until his clutch buckets in the final minute. QUOTE OF THE NIGHT ""We had an opportunity to win it at the end,"" Gentry said. ""But we have to do a better job all together. Defensively, we had a few missed assignments at the end that cost us big. We've just got to be able to execute things at the end of the game defensively and offensively.""","401160917"
"SAN ANTONIO --  This trip looked a lot like Kawhi Leonards last game in San Antonio. LaMarcus Aldridge and Derrick White each had 17 points, and the Spurs beat Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers 107-97 on Friday night. They wanted it more and it showed tonight, Clippers guard Patrick Beverly said. Youve got to congratulate them. They came in here with an edge, with more of a thirst, and it showed. The Spurs stopped the Clippers seven-game win streak in Leonards second appearance in San Antonio as an opponent. Leonard finished with 19 points on 8-for-23 shooting. This wasnt just any old team, San Antonios DeMar DeRozan said. Its a high-caliber team in our conference. We went out there and compete, compete, compete and the outcome came out our way. San Antonio had lost two straight and 12 of 14, but it found its footing against Los Angeles and its former teammate. Leonard spent his first seven seasons in San Antonio before demanding a trade. He was shipped off to Toronto and won his second NBA Finals MVP last season before joining the Clippers as a free agent. Leonards initial return to San Antonio on Jan. 24 resulted in thunderous boos and a 125-107 loss for the Raptors. Fridays game had a similar feel. Uhm, didnt make nothing of it, Leonard said of the reception. Felt like a normal away game. It may have been routine for Leonard, but it was an exception for the Spurs (7-13) in their worst start in 23 seasons. Everybody, right down the line, everybody was aggressive, picking up the way we need to, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. We just need to do it more often and get more consistent. Leonard received a chorus of boos during pregame introductions and whenever he touched the ball. The level of vitriol increased throughout the game, especially with the Spurs having by far their best game of the season. Leonard missed his first three shots before collecting a steal at the free-throw line and sprinting down court for an uncontested dunk as the Clippers led by as many as eight points in the first quarter. Marco Belinelli helped the Spurs move in front, making a 3-pointer and a no-look pass to Trey Lyles for a 32-30 lead with 11 minutes remaining in the first half. We had a couple stretches tonight where we just put runs together, Spurs center Jakob Poeltl said. Really came out strong with energy on the defensive end. Then all of a sudden, the shots start falling and it really got us going. Poeltl, who was acquired by San Antonio in the Leonard deal, continued the momentum with four points and three blocks in a pivotal run in the second quarter, including two blocks on Leonard that drew deafening cheers. Whenever one guy hustles, makes a big play, that ignites us on the bench and on the floor and gets our crowd going, said DeRozan, who also came over in the Leonard trade. Patty Mills 3-pointer with 10:32 remaining gave the Spurs an 81-71 lead, prompting a timeout from the Clippers. The Spurs made five 3-pointers in the final quarter, going 14 for 36 from beyond the arc for the game. DeRozan had 15 points, and Poeltl had six points, six rebounds and four blocked shots. Paul George had a season-low five points on 2-for-11 shooting for the Clippers. INSULT TO INJURY Clippers coach Doc Rivers was locked out of the locker room after finishing his postgame press conference. Fitting, Rivers deadpanned. Thats the kind of night its been for us. KEEP SHOOTING Popovich has encouraged White to shoot 3-pointers even though he has struggled at times this season. White responded with a career-high five on 5-for-7 shooting from deep. I think Im going to take like 20 next game, White said. Just try to get the looks that I get, let it fly, shoot with confidence. TIP-INS Clippers: Landry Shamet missed his 10th straight game with a sprained left ankle. Shamet, who has started all 10 games he has played, is averaging 9.1 points in 29.4 minutes. Spurs: The Spurs played their 700th game at the AT&amp;T Center since it opened in 2002. They have the most wins at home of any team during that span with 564 victories.","401160918"
"PHOENIX -- Luka Doncic was in total control, getting into the lane when he wanted, getting the shots he wanted and getting the ball to teammates in places where they could do some damage. Because of that, the Dallas Mavericks got the result they wanted with an 120-113 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. Doncic tied a career high with 42 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added 26 and the Mavericks bounced back from a disappointing loss to the LA Clippers three days earlier. ""Great players have a short memory for tough games,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said about Doncic's big night. ""They move forward. They're always thinking ahead and about the next challenge. He was spectacular tonight from start to finish."" The second-year guard just missed a triple-double with 11 assists and nine rebounds. Hardaway shot 6-of-9 from 3-point range to help offset a quiet night from Kristaps Porzingis, who finished with two points. The teams entered the final quarter tied at 89. The Mavericks went on an 8-0 run midway through the fourth to take a 104-97 lead and never trailed again. Doncic was coming off a subpar outing Tuesday night in a loss to the Clippers, where he shot 4-of-14 from the field and missed all eight 3-point attempts. The 20-year-old was superb in Phoenix, making 12 of 24 shots from the field and 15 of 18 free throws. He said he didn't get too low after the Clippers loss and was no more motivated than normal Friday, even if his performance suggested he had a little extra fire. ""It's just one game -- we lost one game,"" Doncic said. ""We shouldn't be worried about that. You go to the next game and pretend like nothing happened. I'm anxious to go out there every night. I'm excited about every game. That's me."" Phoenix has lost six of its past seven games. Kelly Oubre Jr. led the Suns with 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Ricky Rubio added 21 points and nine assists. ""We didn't play our game the last quarter,"" Rubio said. ""I think we got focused on the wrong things, things we can't control."" Doncic had 14 points, six rebounds and six assists in the first quarter as the Mavericks edged to a 53-50 halftime lead. Oubre had 13 for the Suns. EMOTIONAL SUNS Friday's game was entertaining and a little emotional, with a handful of moments where Suns and Mavericks players had to be separated. Phoenix coach Monty Williams said his team struggled with composure. ""Both teams were pretty emotional tonight,"" Williams said. ""But I just felt like it affected us more."" HARDAWAY'S BIG NIGHT Carlisle recently moved Hardaway into the starting lineup and the 6-foot-5 guard has responded with a string of big games. Over the past two weeks, he's had 16 points against Cleveland, 31 against Houston and now 26 against the Suns. ""It's seizing the opportunity and being prepared,"" Hardaway said. A FREE THROW ADVENTURE Suns forward Frank Kaminsky inadvertently contributed to a rally with two of the worst free throws of his professional career. Kaminsky -- a respectable 76% career free throw shooter -- had a stunning air ball on his first of two free throws during the third quarter. He overcompensated on the second, pounding it off the backboard and rim before getting his own offensive rebound. The extra possession led to a huge dunk by Devin Booker to put the Suns up 69-63. TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis and Phoenix's Aron Baynes both received technical fouls in the second quarter when they got into an argument coming off the court during a timeout. ... Doncic averaged a 30-point triple-double in November, becoming just the third NBA player to accomplish that feat in a calendar month, joining Oscar Robertson (five times) and Russell Westbrook (twice). ... The Mavericks improved to 12-6 for their best start since the 2010-11 season, when they won an NBA title. ... Porzingis missed all eight shots he took from the field, including six 3-pointers. Suns: Baynes returned to the lineup after a five-game absence because of a right hip flexor sprain. He finished with 17 points and seven rebounds in 25 minutes. ... Phoenix fell to 8-10.","401160919"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Carmelo Anthony can't recall another a 10-block game like Trail Blazers teammate Hassan Whiteside had against the Bulls. Anthony had 23 points and 11 rebounds and the Blazers downed Chicago 107-103 on Friday night for their second victory over the Bulls this week. But Whiteside stole the show with 8 points, 15 rebounds and a franchise-record 10 blocks for Portland. ""Never seen that before, and I've played with some great shot-blockers,"" Anthony said. ""Tyson Chandler was a great shot blocker, Marcus Camby was a great shot-blocker. I've never seen a guy with 10 blocks in a game."" Before Friday night, Anthony had played in two games where a player had 10 blocks; both were accomplished by Camby in the 2007-08 season, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research. Damian Lillard added 28 points, including 10 in the final quarter, for the Blazers, who have won three straight after four consecutive losses. The Blazers led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter, but the Bulls pulled within 85-84 in the final period. CJ McCollum stalled the rally with a 3-pointer for Portland. Anthony's 3 made it 91-84 with 7 minutes, 28 seconds left and he held up three fingers for the cheering Moda Center crowd as the Bulls called a timeout. Lauri Markkanen's 3 closed the gap for Chicago to 93-92. Lillard answered with his own 3 to again hold off the Bulls. After Zach LaVine's corner 3 with 31.7 seconds left narrowed it to 105-103, Whiteside tipped in Lillard's shot for the win. ""I told the guys, I'm insurance now. When they go up for a layup, I'm going to be there. I might not get them all, I know a lot of people want me to get every single one, but I'm going to do my best job to get a lot of them,"" Whiteside said about his blocks. LaVine finished with 28 for the slumping Bulls, who have lost seven of their past nine games. This was a frustrating one, very winnable,"" LaVine said. ""We were battling. Dame did what he did in the fourth quarter, turned it up to another level."" The Blazers have been boosted by the recent signing of Anthony, who scored 25 points in Portland's 117-94 victory over the Bulls in Chicago on Monday. The Blazers acquired the 10-time All-Star to shore up the frontcourt and help the team overcome a slow start after going to the Western Conference finals last season. The deal was official Nov. 19. Between the two games against the Bulls, the Blazers defeated Oklahoma City 136-119 on Wednesday night. The Bulls fell to the injury-plagued Golden State Warriors 104-90 on Wednesday at the new Chase Center to open a three-game road trip. Tomas Satoransky was a game-time decision for the Bulls with a left toe bruise, but started. Ryan Arcidiacono, who has been slowed by a right elbow strain, also played. Coby White's layup put the Bulls up 28-22 near the end of the first quarter but neither team was able to reach a double-digit margin in the first half. Lillard's layup gave Portland a 49-43 lead late in the opening half and the Blazers went into the break ahead 53-47. LaVine led all scorers with 18 points at the half, but four of the Blazers starters were in double figures, including Anthony. Whiteside had collected seven blocks by early in the third quarter, but he also picked up four personal fouls. The Bulls pulled within 57-56 on Satoransky's 3-pointer, but Lillard came back with a 3 for Portland. The Blazers went up 72-60 midway through the third quarter on McCollum's 3-pointer as they appeared to pull away. But White's 3-pointer narrowed the gap to 79-76 and the Bulls rallied to within three points heading into the fourth quarter. ""This loss hurts, this is a painful loss, every loss these guys take hurts,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""This was a hard-fought game, give them credit."" TIP INS Bulls: The Bulls made 14 of 38 3-point attempts. ... Chicago went into the game with 187 steals this season, most in the league. ... It was the second of a three-game West Coast road swing that ends in Sacramento, California, on Sunday. ... The Bulls celebrated Thanksgiving and visited Nike while in Portland. Trail Blazers: Anthony's son Kiyan was at the game. ... Whiteside had four blocks in the first quarter alone. ... Portland has won seven straight against the Bulls. ... Anthony moved into 10th place in the NBA for 20-point games with 755. CAN THE BULLS BE SAVED? Forward Kris Dunn was asked afterward whether the Bulls' season was still salvageable. ""Absolutely,"" he said. ""If you look at the standings right now, things aren't going the way some teams would like it to go and that's good for us. We're still learning and trying to figure each other out. I think once we get a win and try to build off that, we can create a streak, and hopefully start creeping up the standings.""","401160920"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers have won 10 straight games for the first time since December 2009, when Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol rode that fast start all the way to their most recent championship. Nobody is ready to declare the current Lakers are headed for a similar summer after their streak hit double digits with an overwhelming effort against the Washington Wizards. Still, it's obvious something special is brewing again in LA. ""That's the best team in basketball,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Their record is 17-2 for a reason."" Anthony Davis had 26 points and 13 rebounds, and LeBron James had 23 points and 11 assists before both superstars took the fourth quarter off in the Lakers' 17th win in 18 games, 125-103 over Washington on Friday night. Quinn Cook scored 17 points and JaVale McGee had 15 points and 11 rebounds for the steamrolling Lakers, who went 14-1 in November to soar to the top of the overall NBA standings. Los Angeles hadn't won this many games in a month since March 2000 -- in another season that ended with a banner. Los Angeles' 17-2 start matches the best in franchise history, but the Lakers realize true history isn't made in November or December, which looks much tougher on paper. ""We have championship aspirations, but that's not what's here right now,"" James said. ""What's here is our next opponent. We want to continue to get better. We have guys who have been there and know what it takes. This is a long process, and we can never shortcut it. But we can enjoy it along the way."" The up-tempo Wizards have been one of the NBA's worst defensive teams this season, and the Lakers' dynamic offense was far too much for them. Los Angeles outscored Washington 84-36 during a 24-minute span extending from midway through the first quarter until midway through the third, when James' jumper put the Lakers up by 37. LA made runs of 17-0 and 18-0 during that one-sided stretch, showing off the remarkable chemistry already established in just the 19th game of the season for this newly minted superteam. ""I think we're tested every night,"" Davis said. ""We're going to get everybody's best shot no matter what, because of who we are. But it's up to us to make sure we lock in."" Bradley Beal had 18 points and nine assists and rookie Rui Hachimura had 16 points and eight rebounds for the Wizards, who have lost three of four. Washington had several good stretches, but committed 19 turnovers and dropped to 1-2 on a four-game West Coast road trip. ""They made a fair amount of mistakes just as well, and we forced them into it,"" Beal said. ""It's just a matter of sustaining our runs when we have them, and try to keep them from going on such large ones. They are a talented group."" Washington actually opened with a 15-4 lead before the Lakers began to dominate. Los Angeles jumped to a 21-point lead at halftime with 19 points from Davis, and the Lakers poured it on with an 18-0 run early in the third quarter, eventually taking a 90-51 lead. Isaiah Thomas scored 10 points to lead the four former Lakers on Washington's roster. TIP-INS Wizards: G C.J. Miles is out until at least next week with a left wrist ligament injury. He also missed Thursday's game at Phoenix. ... Brooks' jersey will be retired at UC Irvine on Saturday. The Northern California native spent two high-scoring seasons with the Anteaters from 1985-87 before his decade as an NBA player. ""It's humbling,"" Brooks said. ""It's awesome. I love Irvine. It's a terrific school."" ... Shohei Ohtani watched the game from a baseline seat near the Wizards' bench. The Los Angeles Angels' two-way performer posed for photos before the game with Hachimura, his fellow Japanese star. Lakers: Avery Bradley will be re-evaluated this weekend in his return from a hairline fracture in his right leg. The veteran has missed eight games. ... Kyle Kuzma limped off the court at the third-quarter buzzer. He returned to the game for the fourth, but left for the locker room later in the quarter. He has a left ankle sprain, and X-rays were negative, coach Frank Vogel said. MOE'S MOMENTS Moe Wagner, the Lakers' first-round pick in 2018, had seven points and eight rebounds for Washington. The German big man also committed a flagrant foul on Dwight Howard, who responded by hitting both free throws and then dunking on Wagner's head on the ensuing possession. Wagner eventually went to the locker room favoring his left ankle with several minutes to play. DWIGHT'S REUNION Howard had eight points, five rebounds and two blocked shots in his reunion with the Wizards, who signed him in July 2018. Howard played in just nine early games for Washington before a spinal injury forced him to miss the rest of the season, and his resulting long offseason of inactivity and soul-searching led to his decision to become a role player with the Lakers. Brooks says Howard has been to the Lakers ""exactly what"" the Wizards hoped he would be for them: ""Unfortunately, he was hurt. I have nothing bad to say about him. He worked hard for us, but just unfortunately didn't have the health to make a difference for us.""","401160921"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Sacramento coach Luke Walton views Harrison Barnes as a calming influence for the Kings, something that showed in a comeback win over Denver on Saturday. Barnes scored six of his season-high 30 points in overtime, Buddy Hield hit two free throws with 9.5 seconds left and the Kings rallied to beat the Nuggets 100-97. ""That's largely my role, to come in to help where needed,"" Barnes said. ""Some nights it's scoring. Some nights it's rebounding, some night it's defense. Some nights it simply just making the right play. That's something I try to do consistently for this team."" Barnes' leadership has become much more valuable while Sacramento plays without injured starters De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley III. He helped stabilize the Kings after they trailed by 17 at halftime, then came up big in overtime when he nearly outscored Denver by himself. ""Tonight, he showed again why he's so important to us on both ends of the court,"" Walton said. ""It was a good, solid win for our group, one that we needed and we worked for."" Sacramento didn't lead until Barnes made a jumper early in overtime. Gary Harris' 3-pointer put the Nuggets up 95-94, but Barnes answered with two free throws and scored on a short lean-in shot. Harris made two free throws before Hield answered with two of his own to help Sacramento end a six-game losing streak against Denver. The Kings became the third team this season to win after trailing by 17 at halftime, joining Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Nuggets failed to get off a shot in the final 15 seconds as Jamal Murray dribbled out the clock. ""We have to come up with something better,"" Murray said. ""The ball was in my hands, so it makes me look bad when that happens. We have to come up with something better, get open, and set some screens. It all comes out in the execution."" Nemanja Bjelica had 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Kings. Richaun Holmes added 13 points and 10 rebounds, and Hield had 21 points despite an off-night shooting. Harris scored 18 of his 25 points in the first quarter. Will Barton added 14 points, 12 rebounds and five assists. Murray scored 15 points. The Nuggets missed a chance to win in regulation when Holmes blocked Murray's shot from behind at the buzzer. ""You have to get a shot off at the end of regulation and you have to get a shot off at the end of overtime, and we didn't get a shot off either time,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""Obviously I have to do a better job in terms of helping us with that late game execution."" Sacramento was behind 75-67 entering the fourth. Hield, who struggled with his shot for much of the game, made consecutive 3s and scored on a driving layup to tie it at 90. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver scored 57 points in the first half but was outscored 60-40 after that. ... Nikola Jokic missed five consecutive shots in the fourth quarter. ... Harris' previous season high of 17 points also came against Sacramento. Kings: Holmes' double-double is his sixth this season, a career high. ... Bagley has yet to be cleared to play but is getting closer. The second overall pick a year ago, Bagley has been out since breaking his right thumb in the season opener. Fox (left ankle sprain) is also making progress in his rehab but isn't as close as Bagley. WINNING UGLY The Kings won despite shooting 38.5% from the floor. They are one of six NBA teams to win shooting at least that poorly.","401160922"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons stole a game for the 76ers. Simmons had three steals in the final 13.9 seconds to lead Philadelphia to a 119-116 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. ""I love being able to get steals and turn guys over,"" said Simmons, who finished with 15 points, 13 assists, six rebounds and four steals. ""I take pride in it and it gives us energy."" The Pacers led 114-113 with a chance to go up more when Simmons intercepted T.J. Warren's pass with 13.9 seconds remaining, then assisted Tobias Harris for a breakway dunk that gave Philadelphia the lead with 9.9 seconds remaining. ""I was going to steal it,"" Simmons said. ""If everybody on the backside does their job, it's easier to make a play."" After a timeout, Simmons then stole Jeremy Lamb's inbounds pass with 7.9 seconds remaining. That led to two free throws by Harris that gave the 76ers a 117-114 advantage with 5.1 ticks left. Malcolm Brogdon then made a pair of free throws after being fouled intentionally before Joel Embiid followed with his own two foul shots for a 119-116 Philadelphia lead with 2.8 seconds to play. Simmons clinched it for the 76ers when he stole Lamb's three-quarter court inbounds pass. ""Those turnovers late were costly,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""That was poor execution on our part."" Embiid had 32 points and 11 rebounds and was 15 for 15 from the free throw line. In three games since going scoreless for the first time in his career at Toronto on Nov. 25, the star center is averaging 30.7 points and 14.7 rebounds while making 40 of 44 foul shots. ""I changed my mindset,"" Embiid said. ""I hadn't been as aggressive, so I've been more aggressive creating contact and causing other people to foul me."" Harris scored 22 points for Philadelphia, which won its third straight while improving to 9-0 at home. Warren had 29 points and Brogdon added 28 for the Pacers, who had won five straight. Indiana opened a grueling five-game, seven-day road trip. Both teams were playing the second game of a back-to-back, but neither offense was sluggish. Indiana finished 55% (42 of 76) from the field while Philadelphia shot 49% (38 of 77). TIP-INS Pacers: T.J. McConnell finished with six points and three assists in 11 minutes in his return to Philadelphia, where he played from 2015-19. . Shot 50% (11 of 22) from 3-point range and 84% (21 of 25) from the foul line. 76ers: Josh Richardson (right hamstring strain) missed his second straight game. . Simmons took and missed a 21-foot jump shot with 4:05 left in the third. . Both Simmons and coach Brett Brown were assessed technical fouls by referee Natalie Sago. . Embiid was issued a Flagrant 1 for his foul on Domantas Sabonis with 9:49 remaining in the second. T.J. THE GREAT Brown spoke glowingly before the game about McConnell, who played the previous four seasons for the 76ers and was with Brown at the beginning of the rebuilding process. ""I just loved how hard he played,"" Brown said. ""He plays with his heart on his sleeve and this city loves him."" Brown said the intangibles are part of what attracted him to McConnell, but the guard showed he's more than just an ""effort"" guy. ""He can actually play and play well,"" Brown said. ""I'm very proud of him for his journey. I have a fondness for that man."" McConnell was feted with a video tribute in the first quarter, then received a standing ovation and was embraced by Brown when he entered with 2:59 left in the first. He also was presented a framed 76ers jersey prior to the contest by general manager Elton Brand. HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE Simmons praised Philadelphia's fans for helping the team remain perfect at home. ""We have the best fans in the NBA,"" he said. ""You go anywhere else and there's no atmosphere like it. We want to give everything we have to our city. It's a big responsibility.""","401160923"
"HOUSTON --  James Hardens performance on Saturday night was enough to make even those who see him put up gaudy numbers night after night step back and marvel at his work. Harden scored a season-high 60 points in 31 minutes and the Houston Rockets sent the struggling Atlanta Hawks to their 10th straight loss with a 158-111 romp. Its like everything else he does -- unbelievable, coach Mike DAntoni said. Harden came one point shy of matching his career high and franchise record on a night he made eight 3-pointers and 20 free throws. He watched the entire fourth quarter from the bench with Houston up 127-73 at the end of three. What hes doing has not been seen, teammate Austin Rivers said. My man had 60 and didnt play the fourth quarter. Name another player who could do that right now. It was Hardens fourth career 60-point game, tying him with Michael Jordan for third-most in NBA history, trailing only Kobe Bryant (six) and Wilt Chamberlain (32). Harden is the only active player who has scored 60 points more than once. But as usual he wasnt interested in talking about reaching 60 points while spending an entire quarter on the bench. Nope, he said before walking off and repeating the word two more times. The Rockets were missing starters Clint Capela and Danuel House because of illnesses, but still had no trouble handling an Atlanta team that hasn't won since Nov. 12 thanks to Hardens huge night. We try to do what we have to do against James, which is throw a lot of bodies at him, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Try and put him under duress. He just didnt feel us. Atlanta was never really in this one and was down by 20 points or more for most of the game. The flat effort came a night after the Hawks fell by one point in overtime to the Pacers in a game where Trae Young tied career highs with 49 points and eight 3-pointers. Young led the Hawks with 37 points and had five 3-pointers, but it wasnt nearly enough to offset Hardens game. The Rockets raced out to a 14-5 lead and had stretched their advantage to 81-52 by halftime behind 31 points from Harden for their third 80-point first half in franchise history. As good as Harden was in the first two quarters, it was nothing compared to how he dominated in the third. Houston was up 83-56 early in the period before he scored all of the team's points in an 18-3 run that made it 101-59 with 7 minutes left in the period. Harden made three 3-pointers and was fouled on 3-point attempts three other times in that stretch. He had eight assists, three rebounds, three steals and blocked a shot to go along with his 60-point effort. After the third quarter, Harden was sitting on the bench with a towel draped over his shoulders when he was shown on the video board with a note that said he was two points shy of setting his career high. Harden looked at the screen, read the note and pointed at it while opening his mouth wide in fake shock as if to say: ""I was so close,"" before smiling broadly. Yeah I was playing with the fans a little, but honestly I didnt know, he said. But we played a really good game those first three quarters so it was an opportunity for other guys to play minutes that theyve earned. There were a few half-hearted chants of: Harden! Harden! midway through the fourth quarter from a few fans who hoped to see Harden come back in to make Rockets history. But DAntoni kept the bearded superstar on the bench with the game well in hand. TIP-INS Hawks: Rookie Cam Reddish sat out with a wrist injury. ... Atlanta made 15 of 46-pointers. ... DeAndre Hunter had 14 points. Rockets: Isaiah Hartenstein received a flagrant 1 foul in the second quarter when he fouled Young hard near the neck. ... Russell Westbrook got a technical in the first half for yelling at the Atlanta bench. ... Capela missed the second straight game with his illness and House sat out for the first game with his illness. D'Antoni said he hopes both players can return on Tuesday night. ... Westbrook had 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ... Houstons 158 points were the second-most the team has scored this season. ... Ben McLemore scored 24 points and had 13 rebounds. MORE HARDEN Hes the third player in 25 seasons to have 60 points in three quarters, joining Klay Thompson in 2016 and Bryant (2005). Saturday was the 20th 50-point game of Hardens career, which is the fourth-most in NBA history and eight more than any other active player.","401160924"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo couldnt keep his double-double streak going, though its hard even for the NBAs MVP to put up big numbers in only 20 minutes. Antetokounmpo scored 26 points but his streak ended at 19 games when he grabbed nine rebounds in his shortest outing of the season, and the Milwaukee Bucks coasted to a 137-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Milwaukee (17-3) won its 11th straight and matched its highest point total of the season. The Bucks held a 17-point halftime lead and extended it to 101-75 entering the fourth quarter, allowing Antetokounmpo to sit out the final period. His streak of double-doubles to open a season left him short of Bill Waltons record of 34 with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1976-77. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 29 for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1975-76. I should have left him in, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said with a wry smile. Hes doing amazing things and theres more to come. Were trying to have conversations with him about being healthy and fresh and how important that is. Pretty incredible if youre being mentioned with the greats of our game. Pat Connaughton (team-high 10 rebounds) probably stole it. He steals all the rebounds. Antetokounmpo wasnt worried about the end of his run. That is not how I am built, Antetokounmpo said. I am not built around stats. Obviously, I am just here to win. The Bucks put nine players in double figures and finished November with a franchise-best 15-1 record, losing only on a buzzer-beating shot in Utah on Nov. 8. The 41-point margin was the team's largest of the season. Milwaukee has the league's second-best record, behind the Los Angeles Lakers (17-2). Hornets veteran forward Marvin Williams said Antetokounmpos dominating play was no surprise. Hes so competitive, always wants to win, Williams said. I feel he always wants to play the right way. Ive always been a fan of his. I dont feel like he did anything different than he normally does. He plays with such aggression on both ends of the floor. He attacked the basket and made plays for himself. Then when it wasnt there he kicked it out to his shooters. Robin Lopez, starting at center in place of brother Brook, sparked the Bucks with three 3-pointers and 13 points in 16 first-half minutes and wound up playing 24 minutes. Robin was in the starting lineup with Brook sidelined by back soreness. It was so cool to see him start the game that well and it just gave us a huge boost, Budenholzer said. Brook is such a big part of what we do and to have Robin step in and make those, it was really important to us. And it feels like its been coming. Robin Lopez ended 3 of 5 from beyond the arc and improved to 11 of 32 from 3-point range (34.3%), putting him ahead of his brothers percentage (28.9% on 97 attempts) this season. Numbers speak for themselves, right, Robin Lopez said of his newfound 3-point prowess. We got a lot of motion. We did a great job moving the ball, moving without the ball. Milwaukee shot 56.2% from the field (54 of 96) and limited Charlotte to 36.6% shooting (37 of 101). Devonte' Graham led the Hornets (8-13) with 24 points and Terry Rozier added 19. Milwaukee pulled away in the third quarter as it outscored the Hornets 35-26. Wesley Matthews had 12 of his 14 points in the quarter, going 3 of 4 from 3-point range and adding a three-point play. Khris Middleton came off the bench for the third straight game since returning from a thigh injury and added 15 points, and Ersan Ilyasova and D.J. Wilson each had 11. TIP-INS Hornets: Center Cody Zeller returned to action after missing the two previous games with a left hip contusion He had 11 points in 20 minutes off the bench.  Graham has made huge strides this season, entering Saturday averaging 17.9 points while shooting 41.1% from 3-point distance. Youre on the scouting report now; their best defender is on you now, Hornets coach James Borrego said of the second-year player. Youre getting their best look, their best scheme. Teams are blitzing him now and the kid is handling it extremely well. He has that poise about him. Bucks: Milwaukees 17-3 start is tied for the best 20-game start in franchise history (with the 1970-71 and 1971-72 teams).  Center Dragan Bender was active for Milwaukee after scoring 19 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in the Wisconsin Herds 133-115 win over the Erie BayHawks in G-League play on Friday night in Oshkosh. Bender entered Saturdays game in the third quarter and splashed a 3-pointer for his first points with the Bucks. He finished with 12 points.","401160925"
"NEW YORK --  Any win on the road is a good one, though Jimmy Butler really liked the way the Miami Heat got their latest. Down seven with 1:45 to play, they had to play almost perfect -- and on defense, they sure did. ""I think we finally showed ourselves what we're capable of when we guard,"" Butler said. ""If we don't make shots the way we normally make shots, there's still a way to win and we have to find that way to win. Tonight was a prime example of that."" Goran Dragic scored 24 points, including a three-point play that kicked off a closing 10-0 burst, and Butler added 20 as the Heat rallied to beat the Brooklyn Nets 109-106 on Sunday. Bam Adebayo had 17 points and 16 rebounds for the Heat, who trailed 106-99 but pitched a shutout from there and got the victory thanks largely to the aggressiveness of Butler. He kept attacking the rim and had five free throws in the closing run, overcoming his 5-for-17 shooting from the field. ""What it shows is the mental toughness of great players,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""The ball was not going in all night long but when it really gets to crunch time, when you need a bucket or it is going to be game over, he can put it aside, compartmentalize, and make the big plays. He did that."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 29 points and Harris had a season-high 25 for the Nets, who had won six of their previous eight games. But this was one in which they missed the playmaking of Kyrie Irving, who missed his ninth straight game because of a right shoulder injury. Without their All-Star guard, they couldn't get into anything against the tough Miami defense down the stretch and had just one basket in the final 4-plus minutes. ""A few key possessions kind of got away from us,"" Harris said. ""We didn't do just as good of a job as they did down the stretch to execute."" There were 24 lead changes and 12 ties in the game, with the Nets leading 65-58 at halftime after David Nwaba's 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left. Brooklyn's lead was one midway through the fourth quarter before Harris made two 3-pointers in less than 30 seconds. Butler answered with a 3 for Miami, but Dinwiddie scored five straight to make it 103-95, the largest lead for either team all game. It was 106-99 after another 3 by Harris with 1:45 to play, but that's where the Nets' scoring finished. ""We had opportunities, tons of opportunities. They made the plays, we didn't. Just one of those see-saw games,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. TIP-INS Heat: Dion Waiters was with the Heat but inactive, a day after returning to practice following his 10-game suspension for an incident on the team plane. He has not played this season but will travel on Miami's three-game road trip. ... Spoelstra said rookie KZ Okpala (strained Achilles tendon) was nearing a return and would hopefully begin working soon with their G League affiliate in Sioux Falls. Nets: Atkinson said he hadn't decided whether Dinwiddie would return to the bench when Irving returns, or continue to start alongside him until Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) is healthy. ""Lot of things to juggle there, but I think we've got to focus on this group right now and cross that bridge when we get to it,"" he said. GOOD GRADES The Nets went 9-6 in November, their first winning record in the month since 2012. Atkinson praised the way the responded to losing its starting backcourt during a five-game road trip early in the month. ""You start going into your 13th guy, 14th guy, 15th guy, can those guys come and help you win games?"" Atkinson said. ""And I'd just give our guys, our program, a B+, A in that sense, that we've come out of this thing with the injuries we've had looking in a positive direction. So I feel good about it in that sense."" THOSE GUYS IN GREEN Among the travelers in New York on the holiday weekend were two NBA teams who had games Sunday. Boston was visiting the Knicks and was too close for comfort for Spoelstra. ""It's awkward. We were staying in the same hotel as the Celtics. I wanted to walk right by them,"" he said with a smile. ""But that's this league. Going to talk about our travel coordination and changes.""","401160926"
"NEW YORK --  The Celtics usually beat the Knicks. The Knicks often blow big leads. So there was little reason for Boston to panic when trailing by nine points in the third quarter. Jayson Tatum scored 30 points, Jaylen Brown added 28 and Boston rallied past New York 113-104 on Sunday. Kemba Walker had 15 points and 10 assists, Enes Kanter contributed 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Brad Wanamaker also scored 11 points for Boston. Julius Randle led the Knicks with 26 points. Dennis Smith Jr. scored 17 and RJ Barrett had 16 for New York, which blew a 16-point lead to the 76ers on Friday and has lost six straight. Kevin Knox's long jumper put the Knicks ahead 72-63 with 7:20 left in the period, their biggest lead of the game. ""I don't know if we got down,"" Walker said. ""If there is one thing we're going to do it's to stay positive with each other. We stuck with it. We stayed together. There's going to be more games like this. It's a long year."" The Celtics responded with an 8-1 run and pulled within 73-71 on Walker's 3-pointer with 5:16 left. The Knicks were still up 93-87 in the fourth, but the Celtics went on a 17-2 run to take the lead for good. Semi Ojeleye's 3-pointer tied the score at 95-95, Brown followed with a steal and layup, Tatum hit a free throw, and Walker and Tatum hit consecutive 3-pointers to cap the run. ""At the start of the game we didn't come out with the stuff,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""But it's good that we can turn it to that level, and we had a couple of great ball pressure plays there at the end of the game that helped us create some separating. But I don't think we can keep going into games and giving up 85 points with 10 minutes to go and expect to be successful."" New York committed four consecutive turnovers during the decisive stretch. ""Tonight it was turnovers. Our turnovers sparked them,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""We had four straight turnovers and they capitalized on every one of them. When you have a lead, you gotta get shots on goal."" Brown's bucket with 1:39 left gave Boston its biggest lead of the game, 110-99. The score was tied 58-58 at halftime after a back-and-forth first two quarters. ""There's two halves to a game,"" Brown said. ""We didn't play as well as we wanted to play but it was tied at halftime. We came out in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, and lifted our energy a bit to pull out the win."" Knox finished with 11 points and Damyean Dotson added 10 for the Knicks. TIP-INS Celtics: Other than a 14-point loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in the season opener, every other Boston defeat this season has been by five points or less. ... The Celtics lead the all-time series against the Knicks 296-182, including a 160-64 advantage in New York. Knicks: New York has lost five straight to Boston. The Knicks have not beaten the Celtics since Nov. 21, 2018, and have not defeated them at Madison Square Garden since Dec. 21, 2017.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Playing without star rookie Ja Morant and veteran center Jonas Jonas Valanciunas, the remodeled Memphis Grizzlies knew Sundays look would be experimental for a collection of young players. The makeshift lineups produced the needed energy to pull out a win on the road. Dillon Brooks scored 26 points and Grayson Allen added 13 to push the short-handed Grizzlies to a 115-107 road win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. I hit the guys before the game with a simple message, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. I said were going to have some funky lineups out there. I just need guys going out and just competing. Thats what were all about. Thats what we need to get back to. And Im super proud of them. Jae Crowder had 12 points and 10 rebounds and Bruno Caboclo finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who were missing Morant because of back spasms and Valanciunas because of an illness. Brooks scored 20 of his points in the second half as the Grizzlies countered each Minnesota run to snap a six-game losing streak. We just found a way, figured it out, Brooks said. It started with our defense and then we translated it into our offense. Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Timberwolves. Andrew Wiggins chipped in with 18 points but Minnesota suffered a letdown at home after back-to-back road wins. Very disappointing, Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. You don't want to say it's games you should win, but we're getting guys back, I felt good going into this afternoon. Credit to Memphis, credit to Taylor, credit to that team. They played really hard, they executed, they were good. We lacked energy, big time. A sloppy start by both teams followed the afternoon tip-off. They combined to shoot 35% in the first half with 15 total turnovers. Neither team led by more than five points and Memphis went into half with a 48-47 lead after Minnesotas Robert Covington hit a buzzer-beating jumper after stealing an inbounds pass from Bruno Caboclo. The final minute included a 3-pointer by Josh Okogie that hit the side of the backboard, a missed layup by Grizzlies guard DeAnthony Melton and Okogie getting fouled at halfcourt while off-balance. We got to get back to the drawing board tomorrow, Towns said. Theyre a good team, but we came in with a lot of momentum, were home, we had three days off, we shouldnt have played with the energy that we had. The Wolves appeared ready to shake their lackluster start in the second half when they as Towns scored the teams first nine points and Minnesota tied the game at 61-all. Memphis followed with an 8-0 run. The Wolves had a 12-0 run to take a 72-69 lead before a 10-0 run by the Grizzlies. Memphis finished the third quarter with a 15-3 run in which Minnesota went without a field goal. TAKING OUT TOWNS Towns finished with his ninth straight double-double, but his shot was off. He scored just four points in the first half and finished the game 1 of 10 from 3. We just made his life hell, Brooks said. We pressured the heck out of him. We didnt want him to get into his spots. WELCOME HOME The Wolves welcomed back Memphis point guard Tyus Jones with a first-quarter video. A Minnesota native, Jones played four seasons for the Wolves. Jones said he was going to have about 75 family and friends in attendance. He had 12 points and seven assists,. Ive always appreciated the support that Ive received from everyone in Minnesota, Jones said. Its been nothing but love from the fans. We always support ours. Thats something that makes Minnesota special. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Morant missed the game with an aggravation of back spasms. The team announced that he is considered week to week with the injury. The No. 2 overall draft pick out of Murray State leads all rookies with 18.6 points per game.  Kyle Anderson (right heel soreness) was out. Brandon Clarke (left hip soreness) started after being labeled questionable but didnt play in the second half.  Memphis got 53 points from its bench.  The Grizzlies are 5-0 when Brooks scores 20 or more points. Timberwolves: Backup PG Shabazz Napier made his return after missing 12 games with a right hamstring strain. F Jake Layman missed his fifth straight game with a left toe sprain.  Wiggins was 1 of 6 from 3-point territory, tying Anthony Peeler for the most 3s in franchise history.","401160928"
"LOS ANGELES --  Luka Doncic dribbled up to LeBron James, stepped back and coolly drained a 3-pointer from well behind the line. The Dallas Mavericks driving force then threw a telling stare toward Dirk Nowitzki at courtside before he headed off to wrap up a major win. When the Mavs visited Staples Center a year ago, Doncic was nervous before he faced his boyhood idol, and he sought an autographed jersey afterward. Although the Slovenian youngster still admires the veteran star, Doncic is showing he belongs in the same galaxy. Doncic scored 21 of his 27 points in a dynamic second half, and the Mavericks snapped the Los Angeles Lakers 10-game winning streak with a 114-100 victory Sunday. Doncic also had 10 assists and nine rebounds in Dallas seventh victory in eight games. The Mavs erased a halftime deficit with a 28-5 run in an excellent third quarter led by Doncic, who had 16 points and five assists in the third after going 2 for 9 in a self-described awful first half. Its a great win that means a lot to us, Doncic said. It shows that we can play against big teams, too. We just need to keep it rolling. The Mavs comfortably maintained their big lead in the fourth, and Doncic provided some late showmanship by hitting that fourth 3-pointer over James and staring toward Nowitzki, who had center court seats. He hit a couple of hellacious shots, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Theres just a small handful of guys in the whole world that can hit them. LeBron James is one of them. Hes one of them. Those step-back 30-footers, its hard to describe how difficult the shot is, and how easy he makes it look. Delon Wright had 17 points and nine assists, and Kristaps Porzingis added 15 points as Dallas underlined its status as a likely title contender with an inspired second half on the road against the NBA-leading Lakers, who had lost only once in 18 games since their season opener. It means that we had a good day and did a lot of good things, but we need to stay humble, Carlisle said. Every time we have a game like this, people are more than ever throwing their best game at us. Theres a certain responsibility you have when you get on a roll like this. We need to understand it and keep our eye on the ball. James had 25 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Lakers, who dropped to 17-3 by losing this matchup between two of the NBAs highest-scoring teams. The Lakers longest winning streak in 10 years ended with their largest defeat of the young season. Its one game, said Anthony Davis, who had 27 points and 10 rebounds. Were not going to get down over this loss. We know what type of team we are, we know now. We played well. And they beat us, but we beat ourselves with the rebounding, so we know what weve got to do better. Los Angeles had won six straight over Dallas, but neither team much resembles the rosters that played the last few seasons in these jerseys. After a year of impressive moves by both franchises, the Mavs and Lakers are positioned to be back among the NBAs best. Exactly one month after the Lakers earned an overtime victory in Dallas, the Mavs responded with an impressive all-around effort at Staples Center. The Lakers had their worst day of the young season -- or at least their worst quarter while Dallas outscored them 35-17. They scored a few buckets, and we had a couple calls that went against us, said Lakers coach Frank Vogel, who got a technical foul along with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope for arguing in the third. I think our guys got consumed with that a little bit. But we didnt really have an offensive pop the whole quarter, coming out of halftime. Weve been really sharp and really consistent, but during that stretch we werent, and it cost us the game. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki got a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd after the Lakers played a tribute video on the scoreboard during a timeout in the second quarter. ... Dwight Powell had 15 points and nine rebounds, and Justin Jackson scored 15 points. Lakers: Kyle Kuzma played 21 minutes and scored four points despite spraining his ankle Friday against Washington. ... NL MVP Cody Bellinger and Dodgers teammate Kenley Jansen watched the game from courtside. ... Alex Caruso had 10 points and four rebounds. GETTING TOUGHER The Lakers revamped roster just completed one of the best months in franchise history, going 14-1 in November while soaring to the top of the NBA standings. Davis and James have meshed seamlessly, while their supporting cast has embraced new coach Frank Vogels commitment to defense. But the Lakers schedule gets much tougher in December, starting with this showdown and a three-game road trip in the upcoming week to Denver, Utah and Portland. James and Davis both expect to know more about their roster by January, and this opening game underlined the importance of a consistent effort, particularly on defense.","401160929"
"DETROIT --  Pistons coach Dwane Casey has believed since training camp that he was the right person to unlock Christian Woods potential. On Sunday, he got another sign he might be right. Wood came off the bench to score a career-high 28 points in 22 minutes as Detroit routed the San Antonio Spurs 132-98. Christian is a talent, and there are nights he does things like this and there are other nights when he doesnt, Casey said. Ive always said hes a talented young man, but he has to get more thinking into his game. If he could have consistently done that before now, he wouldnt be on his fifth team. After going undrafted in 2015, Wood played for the Philadelphia 76ers, Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks and New Orleans Pelicans before the Pistons claimed him on waivers in July. He didnt make an immediate impact in Detroit, either, falling behind Thon Maker on the depth chart. He rejoined the rotation in mid-November and has become a key part of Caseys second unit. Theres a big difference from where I was a couple years ago, he said. I would start with maturity and coach Casey. Hes hard on me, but I know it is tough love and now hes given me an opportunity. Along with his scoring, defense and rebounding, Woods performance had another benefit for the Pistons. He scored 19 points in the games final 14:59, giving Andre Drummond a lengthy rest with games coming on Tuesday and Wednesday. Drummond played 26 minutes and Blake Griffin played just 22 as the Pistons got 75 bench points on 67% shooting. Weve got five guys on our unit who can score the ball, and it is huge when (Derrick Rose) gets rolling, because he gets a lot of defensive attention, Wood said. Luke Kennard added 20 points for the Pistons, who had lost eight of 10. Detroit had seven players score in double figures, including four reserves. The Spurs, who lost for the 11th time in 13 games, got 20 points from DeMar DeRozan. San Antonio shot 41% from the floor, including 27% on 3-pointers. Yes, Im disappointed, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. We came out aggressively in our last game against the Clippers and we had energy and execution at both ends. They scored 97 and tonight we gave up 132. It was brutal. Detroit got 45 points off 3-pointers to San Antonios 21. This was another night where we gave up 3-pointers and didnt make any, Popovich said. But I think they did everything better than we did tonight. The Pistons led 59-51 at the half, outshooting the Spurs 51% to 41%. Detroit also had an 24-9 advantage in points off 3-pointers, but was hampered by nine turnovers. Detroit expanded its lead to 72-57 in the first 4 minutes of the third quarter. Bruce Brown had nine points in the surge. The Spurs fouled Drummond on back-to-back possessions later in the quarter, and he made one of the four free throws. Casey replaced him with Wood, who had put up nine points and four rebounds in 7 first-half minutes. Wood quickly added another nine points and two rebounds, helping the Pistons expand the margin to 96-71 at quarters end. Detroit outscored San Antonio 73-47 in the second half. We have got to get better defensively as a team and just bring energy, Spurs guard Lonnie Walker IV said. We have the talent, the players and the coaches, but were just not bringing it defensively. TIP-INS Spurs: C LaMarcus Aldridge (thigh) did not play. ... This season marks the 15th anniversary of San Antonios win over Detroit in the 2005 NBA Finals. Gregg Popovich is still coaching the Spurs, while Tim Duncan, who starred on that team, is now his top assistant coach. Pistons: Drummond fell one point short of the 377th double-double of his career, the most of any NBA player since he joined the league in the 2012-2013 season. Russell Westbrook (302) is the only other player with 300 in that span. ... Pistons rookie Sekou Doumbouya scored his first three NBA points in the fourth quarter.","401160930"
"Two babies surprise The Smoothie King Center with a hug during the baby race rather than reach the finish line. (1:14) NEW ORLEANS --  Chris Paul has seen just about everything in his 15-plus season. So, when it was a matter of who would take control of a tight game down the stretch against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, the 34-year-old Oklahoma City point guard simply drew on his deep memory bank and put everything on cruise control. With the Thunder trailing 94-89 with 5:15 left, Paul scored seven of his 16 points in a 12-0 run over the next three minutes to power Oklahoma City to a 107-104 victory over the Pelicans. Danilo Gallinari led the Thunder with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Steven Adams, Dennis Schroder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 17 points each. Adams also had 10 rebounds. But it was Paul who took over the game when the Thunder needed someone to step up. ""I don't know. It's just winning time,"" Paul said of the critical sequence that followed Lonzo Ball's fourth 3-pointer of the game, which gave New Orleans its biggest lead of the game. ""Fortunately, I've been in that situation a thousand times. If you're (not double-teamed), you go downhill and be aggressive. If you're doubled, you try to make the right play."" Paul started his streak with a pair of 15-footers near the free-throw line and then nailed a deep, fallaway, 3-pointer from the right baseline over the outstretched arms of onrushing 6-foot-11 New Orleans rookie center Jaxson Hayes, which gave the Thunder a 101-94 lead. ""I was just reacting,"" Paul said. ""I've shot that shot probably seven times straight and missed it, so I was probably lucky. Said Adams: ""I didn't even see Chris. He just disappeared."" The ball went in. On the Thunder's next possession, Paul fed Adams in the lane with a slick pick-and-roll pass, and Adams, shooting just 40% from the foul line this season, made both free throws. Adams made 3 of 4 down the stretch and finished the game 5 of 6. ""My eyes were closed every time, mate,"" Adams said, laughing. ""I was actually aiming for the top right corner of the backboard."" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said his team's second consecutive victory over the Pelicans -- the result of good decision-making in the final five minutes of the game -- was a credit to Paul's expertise running the show. ""Steven and Chris in the pick and roll in the middle of the floor was really good closing the game,"" Donovan said. ""I thought Chris did a great job managing the clock and managing the game and getting guys where they needed to go."" Jrue Holiday had 26 points for New Orleans, Brandon Ingram added 20, and Josh Hart had 11 points and 11 rebounds. The Pelicans have lost five in a row. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said he was puzzled by the disparity in free throws -- the Thunder took 26 foul shots to the Pelicans' 10 -- but added his team has to learn how to finish games. In a 109-104 loss to the Thunder on Friday night, the Pelicans went scoreless over the final 2:48. ""We just have to close games,"" Gentry said. ""Their star player, CP (Chris Paul), made plays for them, and that is what stars do, but we have to get it in the basket."" TIP-INS Thunder: The Thunder improved to 2-8 on the road. Pelicans: Ball returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous two games with a stomach virus. Ball has missed eight of the Pelicans' first 19 games, the other six because of a right adductor strain. ... Derrick Favors has missed the last three games following the sudden death of his mother. Her funeral was Saturday. ... Kenrich Williams sat out with a left ankle sprain.","401160931"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Evan Fourniers turnaround season is helping the Orlando Magic in the win column. Fournier matched a career high with 32 points that included the game-deciding basket, lifting the Magic over the Golden State Warriors 100-96 on Sunday night. Fournier, who had a dismal shooting season last year, was 13-for-21 shooting, including 6 of 10 from 3-point range against the Warriors. His biggest basket came with 9.3 seconds left in the game and Orlando clinging to a 96-95 lead. Fournier went one-on-one with Draymond Green, a former defensive player of the year. He beat Green off the dribble and continued through a wall of interior defenders to lay the ball in and give the Magic a 98-95 advantage. That was a great play, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Hes not just scoring for us, hes scoring efficiently, I mean 32 points on 21 shots, thats efficient offense. This was a big-time win, Fournier said. There are more opportunities for me (because of injuries) and coach (Steve Clifford) calls my name more. Im trying to make the right play. Terrence Ross came off the bench to score 19 points for the Magic, who struggled to make a shot. Orlando shot 42.5% (37 of 87), but the combination of Fourniers shooting and solid team defense were enough to get the win. Jonathan Isaac had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Markelle Fultz contributed 14 points and nine assists for Orlando. Glenn Robinson III led Golden State with 19 points. Eric Paschall scored 17 points and Alec Burks 15 for the Warriors, who had all five starters score in double figures, yet lost for the fifth time in six games. Golden State was down six going into the final minute and trimmed the deficit to 96-95 on a 3-pointer by Burks with 33 seconds to play. The Magic called on Fournier, and he drove around Green and through the heart of the Warriors defense to make a layup that gave Orlando a 98-95 lead with 9.7 seconds left. Burks hit one free throw to make it a two-point game and had one more attempt, but missed a 3-point try from the corner in the final second. Aaron Gordons two free throws pushed the final margin to four. Tonight was a really good fight, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. We were able to compete, and we defended like crazy. We couldnt do that against anybody in the first part of the season, so thats an improvement. Well get over the hump, but its just not there yet. The fourth quarter was back-and-forth, with neither side able to get more than a three-point lead until Ross drained a 3-pointer from the wing to make it 93-89 with 1:23 left in the game. Orlando increased its lead to six when Khem Burch made two free throws, but Golden State wasnt done. The Warriors made three of four free throws and Burks drilled a 3-pointer to make it 96-95 with 33 seconds left. Golden State couldn't finish off the rally from there. TIP INS: Warriors: Golden State scored only nine of its 51 points from the perimeter in the first half. ... Golden State had won 11 of its last 12 meetings with Orlando. ... Rookie F Eric Paschall has scored in double figures 10 straight games, averaging 18.6. ...

"TORONTO --  Fred VanVleet and the Toronto Raptors hardly anticipated an easy night against the Utah Jazz. ""I don't think any of us expected to be up 40 against that team,"" VanVleet said. Pascal Siakam scored 35 points, VanVleet had 21 points and 11 assists, and the Raptors used a record-setting first half to rout the Jazz 130-110 Sunday. Toronto led 77-37 at the intermission, the biggest halftime lead in franchise history, the biggest in the NBA this season, and tied for the eighth largest in league history. It also marked the biggest halftime deficit in Jazz history. ""We were awful,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Siakam (26 points) and Gasol (11) combined for as many first-half points as the entire Jazz roster, helping Toronto win its franchise-record ninth straight home game to open the season. The Jazz rallied in the second half but still suffered their biggest defeat of the season. Utah lost by 19 at Indiana last Wednesday. ""Obviously, our focus to begin the game has to be better,"" Snyder said. Siakam shot 4 for 22 and scored a season-low 10 points in Friday's win at Orlando but bounced back against by making eight of his first 10 field goal attempts. He shot 14 for 22 overall, matching his career high with five 3-pointers. He also had five against New York last Wednesday. ""He's got a lot of pride in his game,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""When he has an off game, I just think he comes out mentally ready to roll. You could just see him with aggressiveness and confidence."" Serge Ibaka returned after missing 10 games because of a sprained right ankle and scored 13 points in 21 minutes as Toronto won its seventh straight overall and improved to 5-2 against Western Conference opponents. Mike Conley scored 20 points and Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 11 rebounds as the Jazz lost for the third time in four games on their five-game trip, which ends at Philadelphia on Monday night. ""We didn't match their energy at all,"" Conley said. ""We knew it was going to be physical, we didn't handle the ball well. We didn't get back on defense, we didn't do little things that good teams do."" Utah's Jeff Green scored a season-high 19 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16. Utah took an early lead before Siakam scored 10 points and Gasol added eight during a 23-2 run, giving Toronto a 28-11 lead with 3:24 left in the opening quarter. Mitchell stopped the Raptors surge with a 3, but Siakam scored 19 points in the first as Toronto led 37-20 after one. After making just 5 of 27 field goals in the second quarter, the Jazz connected on 16 of their first 19 attempts in the third. Conley scored 13 points in the third and Mitchell had 11 as the Jazz outscored the Raptors 49-30 to cut the gap to 107-86. TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert missed a wide-open dunk in the first. ...

Toronto is 10-0 when OG Anunoby scores at least 10 points. He had 10 Sunday. HUGE HALVES The Raptors' 77 points in the first half was a season high. Their previous best was 66 in the first half at Milwaukee on Nov. 2, a game Toronto lost 115-105. Toronto's record for points in a half is 79, reached twice. The Raptors lost the most recent game in which they had a 79-point half, 132-129 at Cleveland on March 21, 2018. DEFENSIVE DOMINANCE Toronto allowed 36 points in the first half in Friday's road win over Orlando, the lowest-scoring half by a Raptors opponent this season. COMFY CUSHION Utah's 49-point quarter matched the biggest ever against the Raptors. Toronto also allowed 49 points in the fourth quarter against Chicago on Dec. 22, 2014. ""That's the point of getting up big, is to give yourself a cushion to finish out the game,"" VanVleet said.","401160933"
"LOS ANGELES --  Coach Doc Rivers called the first play of the game for Paul George and he hit a 3-pointer. His teammates found him the rest of the way. Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points, George added 31, and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past undermanned Washington 150-125 on Sunday night for their 12th win in a row over the Wizards at home. ""It's those new shoulders. He's just a great shooter,"" Rivers said of George. ""He's shooting deep shots on the move and doing it with great balance."" Montrezl Harrell added 23 points and a career-high 15 rebounds and Lou Williams had 22 points for the Clippers, who led all the way in improving to a franchise-best 12-1 at Staples Center. ""Their athletes are long, wiry and strong and defensive-minded,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""On top of that, they can score. That's a great benefit."" The Clippers shot 57% in taking a 27-point lead in the first half when George had 27 points. ""We just came out a little bit more aggressive as a unit,"" Williams said. ""We were very efficient on the offensive end. The shots we took a lot of times were ones we wanted to take."" George and Leonard combined to score 10 of the Clippers' first 13 points in the third when they led 95-69. The Wizards ran off 11 straight points to close within 15 in their only major spurt of the game. From there, the Clippers outscored Washington 19-12 to lead 116-98 going into the fourth. For the game, the Clippers shot 55%, owned a 66-46 edge in the paint and their bench outscored the Wizards reserves 73-39. ""We're pretty good once we're clicking,"" Williams said. ""Every once in a while you kind of see glimpses where guys are on the same page."" Rookie Rui Hachimura scored a career-high 30 points and Bradley Beal added 23 points and 11 assists for the Wizards. They were without injured John Wall, Moe Wagner, C.J. Miles and Ian Mahinmi in losing for the fourth time in five games. Davis Bertans had 20 points and a tied his career high with six 3-pointers for Washington. Leonard scored 11 of the Clippers' first 20 points in the fourth. George added a pair of free throws and Williams scored seven in the stretch that extended their lead to 138-107. Leonard and George then sat down and turned it over to the bench to finish off the blowout victory. It was the second time this season the Clippers scored 150 points. They beat Atlanta 150-101 last month. TIP-INS Wizards: They'll play the Clippers again next Sunday, the fourth time in series history the teams play both games in December. ...

They improved to 12-0 when leading at halftime. AT THE LINE The Clippers took 40 free throws and made 32. George hit all of his seven attempts, Leonard made all of his four and Williams made eight of nine. BEAL'S TECH Beal got called for a technical in the third after getting knocked down attempting a jumper. ""I just want the same respect everyone else is getting. Plain and simple,"" he said. ""Because any other time anybody else is coming up under your foot, even if it was unintentional or not, that's the rule. I have to be able to land on my own two feet and I didn't do that, but I got hit with a tech."" HACHIMURA'S ADJUSTMENT The rookie out of Gonzaga played a career-high 38 minutes, mostly because the Wizards were short-handed. ""I'm still trying to get used to the NBA games. It's different compared to college,"" Hachimura said. ""A lot of travel, a lot of games. I have to take care of my body more and I can play 30 minutes or 35 minutes every game and be physical.""","401160934"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  It didnt matter to Kelly Oubre Jr. that he missed his first seven shots from beyond the arc. Oubre learned a long time ago how important it is to keep on shooting. Oubre made his last two 3s, both coming in the final 55 seconds, and finished with 23 points as the Phoenix Suns overcame a seven-point deficit in the final minute to beat the Charlotte Hornets 109-104 Monday night. I was 0 for 7 at the time, but I just knew I could shoot the ball, Oubre said. I knew if I kept at it with the right mechanics they would fall. Oubre said hes worked tirelessly on his jump shot, eager to prove he can be a consistent 3-point shooter. People say that is one of my flaws, Oubre said. They say I can be a more consistent jump shooter. But at the end of the day, I am getting better. Devin Booker added 23 points and Dario Saric had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who snapped a three-game skid. Marvin Williams led the Hornets with a season-high 22 points. Devonte Graham finished with 15 points and 12 assists but was just 1 of 10 from beyond the 3-point arc and had four turnovers, including a big one late in the game. The Suns led by 20 at the break but squandered that lead and trailed by five in the final minute. Thats when Oubre knocked down back-to-back 3s to put the Suns ahead with 19.8 seconds left. The Hornets were setting up for the potential winning shot when P.J. Washingtons handoff went off Grahams leg with Oubre defending the play. Ricky Rubio added two free thows to push the lead to 107-104. Graham had a chance to tie it but airballed a shot from the top of the key with 9 seconds left. A series of mistakes in the final minute left Hornets coach James Borrego upset after the game. We know our job on a free throw box out, Borrego said. I dont care if youre 18, 20 or 40 years old out there. You know what were supposed to do. You know what we do on our coverages down the stretch. If you miss a shot, so be it. You may have a turnover once in a while, but there are some things that happened down the stretch that are inexcusable and just poor basketball. TIP-INS Suns: Were outrebounded 53-37. ... Booker was 3 of 10 from 3-point range. ... Frank Kaminsky had 12 points in his return to Charlotte. ... Ty Jerome made his NBA debut. He had four points and four assists in 12 minutes. Hornets: Nic Batum left the game in the first half with hand discomfort. Its the same hand that kept Batum out of 11 games earlier this season. ... Bismack Biyombo got a rise and a lot of laughs from his teammates when he successfully executed a Euro-step on a fast break. SLOW STARTS Before the late-game collapse, it appeared the Hornets were going to overcome a horrible first half in which they committed 15 turnovers and scored just 39 points while going 4 for 16 from 3-point range. Williams said he wonders how good the Hornets could be if they played with the same sense of urgency early in games as they down when they fall behind. Thats the big question around here, Williams said. It feels like we never really play as hard as we can until we get down by 5, 10 or 15. TIGHT COACHES Monty Williams and Borrego once worked together in the film room for the San Antonio Spurs. On Monday night they got to coach against each other. We got close, our families got close and when I got the job in New Orleans, Pop (Gregg Popovich) gave me a call and said one of the best things you could do was hire JB, and it was, Williams said of his friendship with Borrego. Weve been pretty tight ever since. ... Weve been together for a while and Im just happy that hes getting to run his own program, because hes a good dude.

"PHILADELPHIA --  James Ennis III hit a 3 and dropped for three pushups, celebratory calisthenics in an early run in which the 76ers flexed their offensive muscle ""I wanted to get a little workout in,"" Ennis said. Ennis passed the fitness test and Tobias Harris scored 26 points to keep Philadelphia perfect at home with a 103-94 win over the Utah Jazz on Monday night. Al Horford scored 17 points to help the Sixers win for the eighth time in nine games and improve to 10-0 at home. A night after the Raptors led the Jazz by 40 points at halftime, the Sixers led by a more modest 18 points at the break -- a cushion needed late to secure the win against Utah. ""We say every game before we get out there to protect our house,"" Harris said. ""Our crowd, our energy, our atmosphere, it's real."" Ennis, Philly's super sub, had the crowd going wild in the first half when he was fouled on a 3 and did three quick pushups to stretch the lead to 26 points. Ennis missed the free throw but it hardly mattered at home. The Sixers made 13 3s and have started to play more like a team expected to contend for an Eastern Conference title than one that slogged through a 2-5 stretch in mid-November. ""It's in the moment,"" Ennis said. ""I didn't mean nothing by it. And one."" Horford did his part, scoring five baskets in the first quarter for 12 points, to go with one ridiculous block. Bojan Bogdanovic took a turnover the other way and went straight down the middle for a layup attempt, when a hustling Horford caught up from the right and twisted his body for the rejection. They blocked, they exercised, they alley-ooped. Matisse Thybulle turned a steal into an alley-oop dunk for Ben Simmons and Harris came right back for a 3 that made it 52-27, a game the Sixers had in control until a late push by the Jazz got them within single digits. ""It's nice until they make a run,"" Simmons said. ""They're always going to fight."" Rudy Gobert led the Jazz with 27 points. The glaring blemish for the 76ers was another off-night for All-Star center Joel Embiid. Four games after Embiid went scoreless (0 for 11) against Toronto, he scored 16 points on just 5-of-13 shooting. Embiid played 29 minutes and continued to defy the load management expectations that had been set in recent seasons for the oft-injured big man. He looked gassed at the end of the fourth, right when the Jazz made a push to close within 10 with 4 minutes left. Joel Engles made it 99-92 on a 3-pointer with 57 seconds left to make it a bit uneasy for the Sixers before it dragged to its inevitable conclusion. ""There's a lot of teams, I think, in that situation that wouldn't have responded the way this team did,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. TIP-INS Jazz: G Mike Conley left in the second half with a tight left hamstring. 76ers: G Joel Richardson sat out due to right hamstring tightness, and G Trey Burke missed the game with an upper respiratory infection. ... Simmons had four steals and Thybulle had three. ... Brown was hit with a technical in the first half. SOUR NOTES The Jazz trailed by 26 early to make a late run -- highlighted by a 28-18 edge in the fourth -- nearly futile. ""You're in the hole like that, you look up and it can be overwhelming,"" Snyder said. ""I'm not trying to spin this like we're rejoicing what happened tonight. We've got to play better. There are things we can do better. We're going to improve. I feel good about that prospect given the fact we saw how we responded.""","401160936"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks found themselves laughing for the first time in a long time. Trae Young scored 24 points, rookie De'Andre Hunter added 18 and Damian Jones pitched in a career-high 16 points with eight rebounds as the Hawks beat the Golden State Warriors 104-79 on Monday night. The Hawks were just happy to win again after snapping a 10-game losing streak in a matchup of the two teams with the NBA's worst records. It was a season low in points scored for the Warriors (4-18) and the fewest the Hawks (5-16) have allowed in a game. Golden State dressed just nine players, even with center Kevon Looney returning to action after missing 19 games with a nerve condition. The opponent didn't matter to Atlanta. The only thing the Hawks cared about was winning. ""It feels good, obviously; we haven't won in a long time, which isn't a good feeling,"" Young said. ""We're all happy, but we have a long way to go ... We have to continue to get better."" Rookie Eric Paschall led Golden State with 24 points, but his teammates combined to shoot 24 of 72 and the Warriors committed 25 turnovers which the Hawks converted into 25 points. The visitors were missing Draymond Green, DeAngelo Russell and Stephen Curry, among others. ""It's frustrating to keep losing. We're all competitors,"" Paschall said after his 11th double-digit scoring game of the season. ""It definitely feels like a step back, getting blown out."" The Warriors led 23-20 after a quarter before Hunter scored six consecutive points for the Hawks early in the second period to give Atlanta the lead for good with a pair of jumpers and a couple free throws. The Hawks stretched a nine-point halftime lead to 76-53 in the third quarter when Vince Carter drained a long 3-pointer with 1:09 left in the period. Atlanta ranks near the bottom of every defensive category, yet they limited the Warriors to 39.8% shooting, and Golden State made just 3 of 17 3-point shots. Paschall made both his tries from long distance. ""We had good spirit, we were switching on and off the ball, making it difficult for them,"" Hawks head coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We knew they were on a back-to-back and they're down a lot of bodies ... It was more the spirit of our guys than anything technical we did."" Hunter scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half. He left the game midway through the fourth quarter with what was said to be a dislocated right index finger with no fracture. Pierce didn't believe the injury to be serious. The Hawks enjoyed their latest win in the locker room. ""The guys are in there, they're fun, they're happy. It's a different spirit than our last time out, "" Pierce said. ""The guys were in there cracking jokes on Cam (Reddish) for missing a dunk, laughing at De'Andre (Hunter) because he was in pain when he jammed his finger. ... It's good to see our guys feel and act normal after a game."" TIP-INS Warriors: Draymond Green did not play because of inflammation in his right heel. That heel kept him out of three games recently before he played in Golden State's two previous contest on a 24-minute restriction. Green will have his jersey retired Tuesday night at Michigan State, where he played collegiately. Several Warriors plan to attend, including head coach Steve Kerr. Teammate Klay Thompson, who is rehabbing a torn ACL in California, is slated to join the festivities in East Lansing, Michigan. Injured guard Stephen Curry will not make it, as he is scheduled for surgery Tuesday to remove pins from his broken hand. ... Former Hawk Omari Spellman, who was traded to Golden State last summer, had 10 points and nine rebounds. ""We didn't really execute what Steve wanted defensively so offense didn't matter,"" he said. ""When I first walked into the gym it was a little emotional. But it's still a job."" Hawks: Guard Allen Crabbe missed the game with flu-like symptoms. ... Rookie guard/forward Cam Reddish had an MRI on Monday morning on his bothersome left wrist. The scan revealed no more than a sprain. He played off the bench, scoring eight points on 3-of-10 shooting. ... Guard Kevin Huerter missed his 11th straight game with a left rotator cuff sprain but participated in a limited practice Monday morning. ... Forward John Collins remains suspended by the NBA. LOW PLACES After a competitive first quarter, the Warriors were gradually run out of State Farm Arena on the way to their sixth loss in seven games. ""A disappointing game, let's put it that way,"" Kerr suggested. ""We were playing for ourselves out there instead of playing for each other. (Losing) wears on you.""","401160937"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Indianas balanced scoring was too much for a makeshift Memphis Grizzlies lineup. Malcolm Brogdon scored 19 points, Domantas Sabonis added 18 and the Pacers beat the depleted Grizzlies 117-104 on Monday night. Seven players scored in double figures for the Pacers, including Myles Turner with 17 points. Jeremy Lamb and reserve Justin Holiday had 15 apiece, with Holiday missing only one of his six 3-point attempts. Holiday said I think guys are just ready, and when they get their chance they seize the moment. Its a testament to moving the ball, just playing together on both ends, Lamb added. Ball movement has become the key for the Pacers, who have won six of seven. Their passing and cutting provided open shots, and Indiana capitalized by shooting 50% from the field and hitting 16 of 38 3-pointers (42%). You move the ball to the open man and youre going to shoot a high percentage, coach Nate McMillan said. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with a season-high 31 points. Solomon Hill moved into the starting lineup and added 22, also a season best. Dillon Brooks finished with 19 on 7-of-16 shooting. The Grizzlies were short-handed as four players -- all key parts of the rotation -- sat out with various ailments. That left the reserves trying to play with any kind of rhythm. For the most part it was unsuccessful, but first-year Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said he was still proud of the effort, adding theres no excuses. We could have come out super flat, Jenkins said. I know our offense wasnt where it could have been, missing some shots, layups, 3s, but we competed. For McMillan, the key to Indianas recent success has been unselfish play. I just like the fact that were moving the ball, he said. Were sharing the ball, getting the ball to the open man. Normally, when you play that way good things happen. TIP-INS Pacers: Defeated Memphis 126-114 last Monday. ... Sabonis has reached double figures in all 18 games hes played this season. He also had 14 rebounds in his 15th double-double of the season.  T.J. Warren was held to 14 points, all in the first half. He had at least 23 in three of his previous four games. Grizzlies: Played without both their first-round rookies. G Ja Morant is nursing a sore back sustained in last Mondays loss at Indiana, and F Brandon Clarke is dealing with left hip soreness. Meanwhile, forward Kyle Anderson also sat out with right heel soreness. C Jonas Valanciunas was out with an illness.  Tyus Jones started in Morants place, and Hill replaced Valanciunas. It was Hills first start of the season. MELTON EMERGES Memphis reserve guard DeAnthony Melton benefited from the absence of other rotation players, playing a season high in minutes (just under 25) and scoring a season-best 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting. He also grabbed nine rebounds. Some think Melton should be getting more playing time, and his performance against the Pacers seemed to bode well. Loved it, Jenkins said, later adding: If he keeps having the simple mentality on defense and offense and keeps his game plan pretty simple for himself, I think he could have a really bright future. LEARNING FROM INJURIES With key players out, Memphis can learn something from the Pacers about how the absences can help create a balanced team. Indiana has had its share of injuries, including guard Victor Oladipo, who is rehabbing a right knee injury. Lamb has missed nine games, while Turner has sat out six. I feel like when a lot of people were injured, a lot of people were able to step up and get some playing time, Lamb said. We really saw what we had and it made us a better team. You dont always see that going through it, but now we see it has made us a better team.","401160938"
"MILWAUKEE --  Knicks coach David Fizdale knew his struggling team faced a huge challenge Monday night against the streaking Milwaukee Bucks. New York stumbled at the start and never had a chance as Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks won their 12th straight game in a 132-88 romp. Antetokounmpo needed only 14 minutes on the court to record another double-double, finishing with 29 points and 15 rebounds. The Bucks won by 44 points after beating Charlotte by 41 on Saturday, the first time in franchise history Milwaukee posted back-to-back winning margins of 40 points or more. It was the fifth time it's been done in NBA history. ""I don't feel we came in here with the idea we could beat this team,"" Fizdale said. ""That is what was most disappointing. They got whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. We never took a real stand."" The Bucks (18-3) led by as many as 47 and cruised behind Antetokounmpo, who pulled down his 10th rebound with 4:43 left in the second quarter for his league-leading 20th double-double. The reigning MVP shot 10 of 14 from the field, including 3 for 4 from 3-point range, while playing 22 minutes. He exited with nearly five minutes left in the third quarter and the Bucks ahead 93-54. ""I watch and listen to him lead his guys,"" Fizdale said. ""He's just impressive. The league is in good hands, I know that, when you've got a guy like that at the top."" Milwaukee's winning streak is the longest in the NBA this season and the franchise's best since the 1981-82 season. The Bucks own the league's top record, ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers (17-3). ""I think everybody shows up every day and they're hungry,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Nobody relaxes. We show up and do our job. We smile; we're having fun about it and it's nice. Usually teams tend to relax, but we don't do that."" The Knicks (4-17) posed little challenge as they shot just 4 of 24 in the first period and trailed 33-15 after one. D.J. Wilson added a career-high 19 points, Khris Middleton had 16 and George Hill 14 for the Bucks, who improved to 9-1 at home. The only Antetokounmpo playing in the fourth quarter was Giannis' older brother Thanasis, who drew cheers from the crowd when he slipped in for a layup early in the period. Thanasis Antetokounmpo, formerly a member of the Knicks, finished with 10 points and three assists. ""It was good for us to get everybody out on the court, have some other guys not play heavy minutes,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Julius Randle paced New York with 19 points and Damyean Dotson had 15. The Knicks shot 30.8% from the field (28 of 91) and made 25.6% of their 3-point tries (10 of 39). Rookie guard RJ Barrett was 0 for 9 and limited to two points in 20 minutes. TIP-INS Knicks: Point guard Frank Ntilikina was out after injuring his back in New York's 113-104 loss to Boston on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Dennis Smith Jr. started in his place and went 1 for 7 from the field while scoring four points. Veteran forward Marcus Morris (cervical spasms) missed his second consecutive game. Bucks: Middleton returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench the previous three games. He averaged 14.3 points in his three games as a reserve, after being sidelined for seven games with a bruised left thigh. Middleton had 10 points in the first six minutes of the game. ""It's just so great to have him back with the starters,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's got such a great feel and is so unselfish."". Brook Lopez (back soreness) was out for a second straight game, but Budenholzer was optimistic the 7-foot-1 center would return soon. ""Giving him a couple games is going to be really wise in the long run,"" Budenholzer said. ""Unless something changes he will travel with us and we're hopeful he will play Wednesday (at Detroit)."" ... The Bucks matched a season high with 58 rebounds, including seven each from Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Ersan Ilyasova and Pat Connaughton. DOMINANT GIANNIS Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the Eastern Conference player of the week after he averaged 34.8 points, 11.3 rebounds and four assists in four games last week. That included a 50-point outburst against Utah, the second 50-point game of his career.","401160939"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Zach LaVine kept getting to the free throw line down the stretch, Lauri Markkanen rediscovered his shooting stroke and the Chicago Bulls finally figured out a way to close one out. LaVine scored 28 points and made four free throws in the final 11 seconds, and the Bulls overcame a sloppy fourth quarter to hold off the Sacramento Kings 113-106 on Monday night. Markkanen had 20 points and seven rebounds, Wendell Carter Jr. added 10 points and 10 rebounds, and Tomas Satoransky scored 14 points as Chicago snapped a three-game losing streak. ""We made the plays we had to make,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""We fought back from being down, we got a lead then we lost it, then we fought back again."" The Bulls (7-14) led by 19 early in the second half but had trouble hanging on. Chicago committed eight of its 18 turnovers in the fourth quarter and made only one basket over the final 4 1/2 minutes. Buddy Hield hit a step-back jumper that pulled the Kings to 102-100 with 2:18 remaining. After Markkanen made two free throws, he and Hield exchanged 3-pointers to make it 107-103. Sacramento got the ball back but Hield missed three shots from beyond the arc in the last 36 seconds, and LaVine sealed the game at the free throw line. ""We're supposed to do things like that,"" LaVine said. ""I think we've been underperforming up to this point. We should be playing like this. We should be getting these wins and holding teams off, but we haven't. We have to prove it not just to the general public and other teams, but to ourselves."" Getting Markkanen going was a key factor for Chicago. He had been held to nine points or fewer in four of the last seven games and went into this one averaging 13.3 points. Against the Kings, he shot 6 of 12 and made four 3s. It's the first time this season Markkanen and LaVine have scored 20 or more in the same game. ""I've been trying to find my spots and it's been a lot of 3s, so I'm glad I got to the rim a couple times,"" Markkanen said. Hield finished with 26 points for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes added 20 points and nine rebounds. ""We took them lightly. We didn't respect them enough,"" Hield said. ""We were up by 11 and we got too cool. When you give a team confidence, they come back to bite you quick."" The Bulls took control with a 21-6 run to start the second quarter. After Carter, Kris Dunn and Markkanen scored on consecutive dunks, Markkanen added a 3-pointer -- Chicago's fifth of the period -- and Lavine made a reverse layup to extend the lead to 54-39. Sacramento trailed by 19 early in the third quarter, then went on a late run to pull to 84-74 after a pair of free throws from Harrison Barnes. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had nine steals, giving the Bulls 204 in 21 games this season. They became the fastest Eastern Conference team to reach 200 since Boston did it in 18 games in 2015-16. . Eight players scored in the first quarter. Kings: Trevor Ariza went scoreless in 12 minutes after missing the previous six games for personal reasons. . Sacramento had won its last four against Chicago. QUOTABLE ""Once he made his first two, he started looking like back to old Lauri. Hopefully, it's wheels up from there."" -- LaVine on Markkanen.","401160940"
"CLEVELAND --  The Detroit Pistons are suddenly on a roll. Blake Griffin scored 24 points, Andre Drummond had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and the Pistons routed the Cleveland Cavaliers 127-94 Tuesday night to win consecutive games for the first time this season. The Pistons thumped San Antonio 132-98 on Sunday and put together another dominant performance, shooting 54% and hitting 18 of 35 3-point attempts. ""We're building it, we're getting better,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""We're not there yet, but we're getting closer."" Griffin played just 24 minutes and was 8 of 13 from the field, including 6 of 7 from deep. Drummond played 31 minutes as Detroit's starters were on the bench for the fourth quarter. Griffin scored 16 points in the first quarter with four 3-pointers. The 6-foot-10 forward missed training camp and the first 10 games of the season with a hamstring injury. ""He didn't have an exhibition season, so he's still getting his sea legs under him and is playing his way back into shape,"" Casey said. Griffin was called for traveling after Detroit won the opening tip but hit a 3-pointer a minute into the game. ""I don't think we've called the first play of the game for me all season, but that's OK,"" he said with a smile. ""It's not how I really get into it. I just do my thing and take what they give me."" Detroit hit 10 3-pointers in the first half and built a 57-38 lead, a margin that steadily grew and reached 35 in the fourth quarter. Cleveland has lost 10 of 11. The Cavaliers were coming off a loss to Milwaukee in which they cut a 22-point margin to three late in the game. ""It's really a tough one for us,"" Cleveland forward Kevin Love said. ""We were pretty happy with most of the game last game and how we played. Tonight we came out and laid an egg."" Collin Sexton scored 22 points, and Tristan Thompson had 10 points and 14 rebounds. Cleveland coach John Beilein removed all five of his starters late in the third quarter with the Cavaliers trailing 87-60. Cleveland's starters returned in the fourth quarter, but the lead reached 111-76 midway through the period. The Cavaliers had a 15-0 run to go ahead 28-24 late in the first quarter, but Detroit outscored Cleveland 38-18 over the final 13:25 of the half. Svi Mykhailiuk scored 15 points for Detroit, which had six players in double figures. Langston Galloway had 14. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit is 2-9 on the road. ... The Pistons and Cavaliers played for the first time this season and will meet three times in January.? Cavaliers: Cleveland didn't shoot a free throw until the 2:29 mark of the second quarter when it trailed 59-40. ... Rookie G Dylan Windler, who has been out all season with a stress reaction in his left leg, is expected to play for Canton of the G League on Thursday. Windler, the 26th pick in the draft, practiced with the Cavaliers on Sunday and Monday. INJURY UPDATE The Pistons announced point guard Reggie Jackson, who has missed the last 19 games because of a stress reaction in his lower back, is showing progress in his recovery and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Jackson, who played in all 82 games last season, was injured against Atlanta on Oct. 24. ""That is encouraging news,"" Casey said. ""Bruce (Brown) has done a good job treading water at point guard after being a forward in college, but we're looking forward to getting Reggie back.""? FAMILIAR TERRITORY Beilein coached against the Pistons for the first time since leaving Michigan and taking over the Cavaliers job. It was pointed out before the game the Wolverines lost a total of 15 games under Beilein the last two seasons. Cleveland is 5-15 this season. ""Thanks for reminding me,"" he said with a laugh. The Cavaliers have lost four of five on a homestand that ends Friday against Orlando.","401160941"
"WASHINGTON --  A game against his hometown team provided the latest highlight in Markelle Fultzs development. Fultz, a native of nearby Marlboro, Maryland, scored a career-high 20 points and added six assists in the Orlando Magics 127-120 victory over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. I caught a lot of eyes with a lot of family (and friends in the crowd), Fultz said. It brings joy to my heart to know that they can see me playing basketball happy and just doing what I love. Fultzs previous career high was 19 points in a home win over the Wizards on Nov. 17. The No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA draft, Fultz played just 14 games for the Philadelphia 76ers as a rookie and 19 last season because of a shoulder injury. He played his 20th game of the season Tuesday and came in averaging 11.7 points. He's a baller, forward Aaron Gordon said. This is what we expect from him every night, not just in his hometown. Evan Fournier scored 31 points and D.J. Augustin added 16 of his 24 in the fourth quarter for Orlando, which has won three of four after earning just its second road victory of the season. Theyre a long, athletic team and I thought they made 3s throughout the game but they made timely ones as well, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. We fought and we battled and we were obviously short-handed but we competed. Bradley Beal scored 42 points for the Wizards, who have lost five of six. Fournier scored 32 in Sundays win over the Golden State Warriors. Davis Bertans added 21 points and Isaiah Thomas scored a season-high 20 for Washington. The Wizards were without starting center Thomas Bryant, who was diagnosed with a stress reaction in his right foot Tuesday and will be re-evaluated in three weeks. The Wizards trailed by 14 at halftime but Bertans second 3-pointer of the quarter pulled Washington within 74-67 early in the third. Beals 3-pointer followed by Thomas basket and another 3 by Beal gave Washington its first lead of the game at 75-74, completing a 21-6 run. Orlando answered and when Michael Carter-Williams scored five straight points late in the quarter the Magic led 94-84. A flagrant foul call on Beal contributed to seven straight points by Augustin in the fourth and Orlando led 104-88 with 10:45 remaining. Thats kind of been our Achilles heel in the past, Beal said. We fight so hard to get back into the game, and maybe take the lead, but you use so much energy trying to get back into the game that you might be gassed at the end. The Wizards got within 127-120 on Jordan McRaes 3-pointer with a minute left. TIP-INS Magic: Gordon had 18 points and 11 rebounds.  Carter-Williams returned after missing six games because of left hip irritation and scored five points in 13 minutes. Wizards: Were outrebounded 48-38.  Were also without reserve center Moritz Wagner (left ankle sprain) and reserve guard C.J. Miles (left wrist ligament injury).  Beal tied Gilbert Arenas (255) for the fourth-most games with 20-plus points in franchise history. SHOT MAKERS The Magic shot 50% for the first time this season, hitting 51.1% from the field (46 of 90), including 15 of 31 from 3-point range. SHAKE IT UP With Bryant out, rookie forward Rui Hachimura (15 points) slid over to the center spot with Bertans starting at forward. Isaac Bonga started in place of Troy Brown Jr., who had five points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench. We need his defensive tenacity, his staying in plays, his length, Brooks said of Bonga before the game. It also gives Troy a spark. He hasnt played well. Hes done a lot of good things, but theres things (he) knows he can play better, and I think this could give him a spark playing with that second unit.","401160942"
"TORONTO -- Jimmy Butler delivered a triple-double to beat Toronto, then turned his focus to Miami's next opponent with an unbeaten home record. Butler had 22 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists, Duncan Robinson scored 22 points and the Heat spoiled Kyle Lowry's return to Toronto's lineup by beating the Raptors 121-110 in overtime Tuesday. ""I'm not going to say that this one is more special than any other one,'' Butler said of Miami's third consecutive victory and second straight on the road. ""Just two good teams going at it. We were fortunate enough to do our job.'' Butler scored eight consecutive points in 55 seconds to begin the extra session as the Heat recovered after blowing a seven-point lead in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. ""When it's closing time, he just makes whatever play is needed,'' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami also won at Milwaukee on Oct. 26, a 131-126 overtime victory. The Heat are the only road team to beat the Bucks this season. Miami closes its three-game road trip at Boston on Wednesday. The Celtics (7-0) are one of three NBA teams yet to lose at home this season. Philadelphia (10-0) and Miami (8-0) are the others. ""We talked about it: We've got one more to win,'' Butler said. ""We'd better get over this one fairly quickly.'' Butler became the 10th player in Heat history to post a triple-double, achieving the feat for the fifth time. ""He was doing even more stuff that you won't see in the box score: encouraging guys, talking, being in gaps defensively,"" Miami's Justise Winslow said. ""He was fantastic for us.'' Bam Adebayo scored 18 points, Winslow had 17 and Kelly Olynyk 16 as the Heat snapped the Raptors' season-high winning streak at seven games, and became the first visitors to win north of the border this season. ""Those guys are exhausted in there,'' Spoelstra said, gesturing to his team's locker room. ""They earned their ice.'' Pascal Siakam had 15 points and 12 rebounds, Norman Powell scored 23 points and Fred VanVleet had 19 for Toronto, which had won a franchise-record nine straight home games to begin the season. ""We didn't have the greatest energy, I didn't think, especially in the first half,'' Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Toronto missed all nine of its field goal attempts in overtime, eight of them from 3-point range. Lowry returned after missing 11 games because of a fractured left thumb. The five-time All-Star missed his first 11 shot attempts, including seven from 3-point range, before making a layup with 8 minutes, 40 seconds to go in the fourth. He finished 2-for-18, including 0-for-11 from 3-point range. Lowry had 12 points and 11 assists in 41 minutes. ""That was terrible,"" Lowry said, blaming his poor performance on rust. ""I'm sure I'll be better next game. It's nothing to be concerned or worried about.'' Toronto trailed 107-100 after Winslow's layup with 1:59 to go in the fourth. Powell hit a 3, Lowry made a pair at the line and, after a missed jumper by Winslow, Powell connected from the corner to give the Raptors a 108-107 lead, their first of the final quarter. Butler tied it by splitting a pair of free throws and Siakam saw his shot blocked at the other end, giving the Heat the ball with just under 20 seconds remaining. Miami advanced the ball before Spoelstra called timeout with 9.3 seconds to go. Butler pulled up for a 3 over Powell, but his shot bounced off the rim, sending it to overtime. TIP-INS Heat: Miami was without guard Goran Dragic (strained right groin). Dragic, who was injured in the first half of Sunday's win at Brooklyn, is also expected to miss Wednesday's game in Boston. ... G Dion Waiters was in uniform for the first time this season.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Luka Doncic has Dallas coach Rick Carlisle searching for new superlatives to describe his second-year star. Doncic scored 15 of his 33 points in the third quarter and grabbed 18 rebounds in just 28 minutes to power the Mavericks to a 118-97 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. ""Eighteen rebounds is a lot. That's a lot of rebounds for a point guard,"" the normally measured Carlisle said with a smile. ""I don't care what planet you're from. That's tremendous."" Doncic shot 9 of 18 from the field, making five 3-pointers, and hit 10 of 13 free throws to lead the Mavericks to their eighth victory in the last nine games. The 6-foot-7 Doncic had 12 points the first quarter and then broke open a three-point game by scoring 15 of the Mavericks' 25 points in the final 9:18 of the third, when Dallas built a 84-75 lead. Two of Doncic's jumpers came from at least 25 feet with no defender in his face. ""I can shoot from halfcourt, too,"" Doncic said with a laugh. ""He has unlimited range,"" said Dallas center Kristaps Porzingis, who was saddled with early foul trouble and played only 18 minutes, allowing him to watch the Doncic show. ""Not only that, but he can get to the rim any time he wants and facilitate for others. He's hooping right now."" Or, as Dallas owner Mark Cuban said when walking out of the Mavericks' locker room: ""He's unbelievable."" Dallas led by as many as 18 points in the fourth quarter and coasted home. Doncic said his rebounding wasn't that difficult against the Pelicans. ""I felt like the ball was just coming into my hands after they missed,"" he said. ""I didn't even know I had 18."" Seth Curry added 19 points off the bench for the Mavericks, and Tim Hardaway Jr. and Maxi Kleber each had 12. Brandon Ingram scored 24 points and Jrue Holiday had 18 for New Orleans, which lost its sixth consecutive game. Doncic had 18 points and eight rebounds to spark the Mavericks to a 59-53 halftime lead. The Mavs overcame a sloppy offensive start in which they committed five turnovers in the first 3:44 and also misfired on 23 of their first 29 shots. The Pelicans scored the first 11 points of the second quarter to take a 35-24 lead, but Dallas responded with a 27-11 run, getting most of its firepower from the bench. Backup point guard J.J. Barea nailed back-to-back 3-pointers and added a driving bank shot to lead the surge. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said his team played well enough defensively but could not overcome 27% 3-point shooting and 40% shooting overall. ""You've got to be able to score, and we couldn't get the ball in the basket tonight,"" Gentry said. ""We missed 12 layups. We missed 21 shots in the paint."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis finished with seven points. ... The Mavericks won just nine road games all last season but are 8-2 away from home this season. . Carlisle said Justin Jackson's improved play is in part due to his summer work, when he put on 15 pounds of muscle. ""He's a guy that gives us a lot of versatility."" Pelicans: Lonzo Ball was 2 of 10 from 3-point range. . Gentry is trying to solve his team's end-of-game woes. ""We have a tendency to fall off, especially in the last six minutes of the game. It's almost as if we play isolation basketball. We've got to get away from that."" . Gentry marveled at Doncic's wise-beyond-his-years game. ""He's been doing this since he was 15 years old. He's been playing with grown men. He was European player of the year when he was 18."" AWARD WINNER Doncic was chosen the Western Conference player of the month for November, and Carlisle said it was richly deserved. ""He's been great really from the start of the entire season,"" Carlisle said. ""It's really cool. The guy's fun to watch, and he's a great competitor.""","401160944"
"SAN ANTONIO --  James Harden had a slam dunk waved off by officials, the first sign that it might not be the Houston Rockets night. Lonnie Walker IV helped make sure of that. Walker had a career-high 28 points and the San Antonio Spurs overcame Hardens 50 points by rallying from a late 10-point deficit to beat Houston 135-133 in double overtime Tuesday. Harden played a season-high 49 minutes coming off a 60-point outing Saturday over three quarters against Atlanta, but he was whistled for two charges in the second overtime. The second came against DeMar DeRozan with 0.8 seconds remaining, sealing San Antonios victory. That followed a bizarre moment in the fourth quarter, when officials erased Hardens dunk with 7:53 remaining and Houston leading 102-89. Officials ruled the ball didnt clear the cylinder, but crew chief James Capers said after the game that, in fact it did clear the net and should have been a successful field goal. Capers said the Rockets did not ask for a review within the 30-second window that coaches can challenge calls, during which time they were arguing and asking for clarification. The botched call crushed Houstons momentum. We just stopped playing and they gained confidence, Harden said. The Rockets led by 22 in the second half and were up by double digits in the fourth quarter for all but the final 4:18. Walker, a second-year guard who has been patiently waiting on the bench most of his career, took over in his first extended playing time to fuel the comeback. It was confidence, Walker said. My teammates kept me going, and once I started feeling it, Im just going to let it go and play my game. I know what I can and cannot do. Im just happy that we played team ball and we got this win. DeRozan added 23 points, nine assists and five rebounds as the Spurs won their second straight at home and snapped the Rockets two-game winning streak. They played faster but more sense of urgency than we did, especially being up, Houston point guard Russell Westbrook said. Harden had six points in the second overtime, including a follow of Clint Capelas missed free throw with 1:41 remaining to put Houston up 131-128. Bryn Forbes tied it at 131 with a 3-pointer, and the teams traded free throws the remainder of the game. In addition to drawing the late charge on Harden, DeRozan was also 3 for 4 on free throws in the final 30 seconds. Thats who he is, hes the leader of the team, Walker said. We expect him to score in crunch time and make big plays and thats exactly what he did. He got us this win. Capela had 22 points and 21 rebounds, and Austin Rivers and Westbrook added 19 points apiece for Houston. Westbrook was 7-of-30 shooting but added 10 assists and 10 rebounds. The Spurs were without starting power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who missed his second straight game with a sore right thigh. San Antonio responded with a group effort to beat the Rockets four days after knocking off the Los Angeles Clippers at home. This is a team that we think we have, weve just got to play like this consistently and we havent really done that, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. So, hopefully, were starting to figure that out. Forbes added 25 points, Jakob Poeltl had 15 rebounds, five blocks and five assists, and Rudy Gay added 14 points in 23 minutes. Houston outscored San Antonio 7-2 in the final two minutes of overtime to force a second OT. Hardens runner bounded off the backboard and rim as the first overtime ended. Walker had 18 points in the fourth quarter, including eight straight to close the period and force overtime. Walkers run started with an alley-oop dunk followed by consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 115-all with 11.5 seconds remaining. He is the most athletic player on this team, DeRozan said. He can do some things a lot of us cant. He was just going out there playing with his will and ability and he got it going. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden remained in the game after tweaking his left ankle and tumbling to the court with 5:26 remaining. Capela appeared to step on Harden trying to save the ball. Harden rose slowly and jogged gingerly upcourt but played all but the final 2:27 of the first quarter. ... Danuel House sat out with an undisclosed illness. Spurs: Walkers previous career highs were 16 points against Denver on April 3 and 26 minutes against Golden State on Feb. 6. He played 35 minutes Tuesday. ... Forbes had 25 points before fouling out with 48.5 seconds remaining the second overtime.","401160945"
"Anthony Davis discusses his attention to the defensive side of his game for the Lakers. (0:42) DENVER --  LeBron James has been compared to Michael Jordan for his entire career, though on Tuesday night it was Anthony Davis who emulated the Hall of Famer. Davis, ailing from flu-like symptoms, took an IV at halftime and then scored 13 of his 25 points in the third quarter to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 105-96 victory over the Denver Nuggets. James also had 25 points, nine assists and a crucial dunk off a miss late in the fourth quarter to clinch a matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference. Jordan's legend grew when he played through the flu in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals, leading the Chicago Bulls to the win and eventually their fifth title in seven years. Tuesday's game was just the 20th of the season for the Lakers but Davis' effort still impressed his coach. ""For him to play through illness and have that kind of performance was something special,"" coach Frank Vogel said. Davis missed the morning film session and his status for the game was questionable until before tip. He showed no effects of the illness, scoring most of the Lakers 24 points in the third quarter. He also had 10 rebounds and helped to hold Nuggets center Nikola Jokic to 13 points. He played nearly 37 minutes after trying to recover for most of the day. ""Sleep. That's really it. Sleep and a couple of medicine things here and there,"" he said of the treatment he took. ""The IV at halftime was trying a way to keep going."" Jamal Murray scored 22 points and Paul Millsap had 21 points and eight rebounds. Jokic added eight assists but wasn't the only one struggling on offense. Denver shot 40.7% and failed to reach 100 points for the second straight game. ""We got the looks we wanted but just didn't hit some shots,"" Murray said. Both teams were coming off losses that ended long winning streaks, but it was Los Angeles that bounced back behind James and Davis and a 56-35 advantage in rebounding. The Nuggets nearly came back in the final minutes. The Lakers led by 10 midway through the fourth before Denver rallied to get within a point with 2:23 left. But the Nuggets didn't score again. The Lakers hit three free throws and James slammed home Davis' missed layup with 1:15 remaining. ""They're one of the top teams to come back from double-digit deficits in the second half,"" James said. ""We knew they were going to make a run. A very good team at home and we just kept our composure."" Denver has lost two in a row for the second time this season and fell to 8-3 at home. ""They are a better team than us right now,"" Millsap said. ""We didn't bring our best game but we were still in the game. If we could have knocked those shots down it would have been a totally different ballgame."" TIP-INS Lakers: Vogel was chosen as Western Conference coach of the month for games played in October and November. The Lakers 17-2 record tied for the best 19-game start in franchise history. ... The Lakers had two goaltending calls in the first quarter. Nuggets: Jokic had more turnovers (five) than made baskets (four). ... Denver Broncos linebacker and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller as well as former Broncos and Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning were in attendance. MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY Nuggets coach Michael Malone was an assistant in Cleveland during James' first stint with the Cavaliers and praised the star's sustained excellence. ""What he's doing at his age, I mean, who is surprised?"" Malone said before the game. ""...LeBron is incredible and that's why he'll go down as one of he best players to ever play the game."" Vogel was also complimentary of Jokic. ""There's no one like the Joker I think that's every played the game,"" he said. SICK BAY Davis wasn't the only Lakers player dealing with a bug ahead of the matchup of the top teams in the conference. ""We have several guys with flu-like symptoms and we had them drink a lot of fluid,"" Vogel said.","401160946"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers are still figuring things out even while theyre piling up wins. Their latest came with the bench outscoring the starters, 66-51. Montrezl Harrell scored 26 points, Paul George added 25 and Los Angeles pulled away in the second half to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 117-97 on Tuesday night. The best thing about this team is were not near where were going to be, coach Doc Rivers said. Kawhi Leonard had an off-night offensively, scoring 11 points on 3-of-15 shooting, but still helped extend the Clippers franchise-best start at home to 13-1. He set the tone with his passing, Rivers said. Early he tried to get everybody else going and then he tried to get himself going. CJ McCollum scored 20 points, Hassan Whiteside had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Damian Lillard added 16 points on 5-of-15 shooting for the Blazers, whose three-game winning streak ended. Carmelo Anthony had nine points and six rebounds two weeks after signing with the Blazers in his return to the NBA. Lillard and Anthony were held under their scoring averages. The game was tied 10 times in the first half before the Clippers eked out a 62-59 lead at halftime. The Blazers shot 52% in the first half; the Clippers shot 50%. At halftime we didnt make any adjustments, Rivers said. We said somethings going to give. We either start defending or were really going to have a tough night. The Clippers outscored the Blazers 27-17 in the third. Portlands shooting dipped to 26% while McCollum had five points and Lillard two in the period. Just imposing our will on the defensive end of the floor, causing havoc that led to us scoring a lot of points, Harrell said. George and Leonard took over to start the third. They each hit 3-pointers and George had a steal and a dunk to go with a free throw from Leonard as part of a 14-3 run that gave the Clippers a 76-62 lead. The Blazers answered with seven straight points to trail by seven. Harrell dominated the rest of the quarter, scoring nine points in the Clippers 21-7 run over the end of the third and start of the fourth that extended their lead to 96-76. They basically got what they wanted in the second half and we didnt have an answer, McCollum said. George tied his season high by making 6 of 7 3-pointers, some arcing like rainbows on their way into the net. As a team, the Clippers made 17 3-pointers on 34 attempts, with Patrick Patterson scoring 15 of his 19 points on 3s. It just shows how deep they are, how many guys they can turn to and how much production they get across the board that Patrick Patterson can come in and have a big night and Montrezl Harrell can come in and have a big night, Lillard said. When you double-team or you trap and they kick it out, theyre throwing the ball out to guys who can play. Patterson and George connected on back-to-back 3-pointers in the fourth before George and Leonard sat down for good with 3:57 remaining. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Gary Trent Jr. (right hamstring strain) missed his fourth straight game. ... They had won six of their last eight against the Clippers, including two of three at Staples Center. Clippers: JaMychal Green (tailbone contusion) sat out after getting hurt on Sunday. GASOLS FUTURE The Blazers waived Pau Gasol two weeks ago and hes returned to his native Spain. But hes still got a future with the team. Coach Terry Stotts said Gasol will join the Blazers coaching staff at some point in the future. Hes a Hall of Fame guy, he can be a mentor to all the players, Stotts said. He can speak to a lot of different players about a lot of different things. Gasol never played a game with the Blazers while recovering from surgery on his left foot in May.","401160947"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Devonte Graham made 10 3-pointers and scored 33 points, and the Charlotte Hornets spoiled D'Angelo Russell's return to the court with a 106-91 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night. Graham was 10 of 16 from beyond the arc and also dished out nine assists and had seven rebounds for the Hornets (9-14), who stopped a two-game slide. Backcourt mate Terry Rozier added 25 points, seven assists and seven rebounds as the Hornets built a 19-point, second-half lead and hung on. Russell finished with 18 points on 7-of-13 shooting in 25 minutes after missing the last nine games with a right thumb sprain. Russell did most of his damage in the first half, scoring 15 points. He started to heat up in the second quarter, scoring eight points on three straight possessions. He beat Graham with a quick drive from the wing and drew a foul for a three-point play, knocked down a 3 from the top of the key and then scored on another drive down the middle of the lane to help the Warriors claw back to within four at halftime. The Warriors (4-19) have lost four straight on their current road trip. TIP-INS Warriors: Eric Paschall entered the game as the first Warriors rookie to score in double figures 11 straight games since Klay Thompson. He finished with 16 points. ... Draymond Green played one night after having his jersey retired at Michigan State. Hornets: Swept the two-game season series. ...

"DETROIT -- Giannis Antetokounmpo was ready to go toe-to-toe with Blake Griffin during a second-quarter flare-up between division rivals Milwaukee and Detroit. The game was turning contentious. It wouldn't stay close for long. ""They're just a great defensive team and just play really physical,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""They want to be physical, they want to be dirty. They want you to get out of your game, and whenever you come in Detroit, you expect that."" Antetokounmpo scored 35 points to lift the Bucks to their 13th consecutive victory, 127-103 over the Pistons on Wednesday night. The last time the Bucks had a longer winning streak than this was when they won 16 in a row spanning the end of the 1972-73 season and the beginning of 1973-74. They also had a 13-game run shortly after that 16-game streak ended. Milwaukee won all eight matchups with the Pistons last season -- four in the regular season and four in the first round of the playoffs. The Bucks also beat Detroit last month in their first meeting of 2019-20. There were six technical fouls in this game, and there were words exchanged during a couple of mild altercations. The first involved Antetokounmpo and Griffin after those two collided around midcourt in the second quarter. ""There's going to be a lot of teams that are going to come out and try to be physical with me -- try to hit me, knock me down to the floor,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I just got to keep my composure."" In the third quarter, Antetokounmpo fell to the floor after being fouled, and then Griffin stepped over him. Milwaukee's Khris Middleton came over to confront Griffin. Three technicals were assessed after that. ""At first, I was trying to ... talk back, let them know that this is more than basketball. We can stop playing basketball and we can fight,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""At the end of the day, my teammates want me in the game, my teammates want me to keep my head in the game and I was like, whatever. At this point, whatever."" That emotions were running high was no surprise to Pistons coach Dwane Casey. ""That's going to happen. In a competitive game, it's going to happen,"" Casey said. ""If anything, that should get you more focused, more riled up, more ready to play, more ready to compete and more ready to be physical and finish at the rim. All those things you have to do in a competitive game like that, a physical game like that."" The Bucks went on a 13-2 run late in the second quarter to lead 57-39, and although Detroit closed to within 11 at the half, the Pistons never made a major run during the final two quarters. Antetokounmpo scored 12 points in the third, and Milwaukee led 92-72 after three. ""I liked our fire in the second quarter. I liked our fire in general,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think the guys, they're in a good place. They're playing good basketball. So we'll keep it going."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 14 rebounds for Detroit. Middleton had 17 points for the Bucks. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had led start to finish in each of its previous two games, but the Bucks trailed 24-22 after the first quarter in this one. Pistons: Detroit came into the game shooting a league-leading 39.9% from 3-point range. The Pistons went 11-of-36 (30.6%) on Wednesday. ... The Pistons were without G Luke Kennard (knee). G Reggie Jackson has played only two games this season because of a lumbar stress reaction. The team announced Tuesday that he'll be evaluated again in a couple of weeks. BLOWOUTS This game probably became a bit more anticipated after the Pistons routed their previous two opponents by 34 and 33 points. But the Bucks had won their previous two by 41 and 44, and this one wasn't close, either. ""They're at the top of the league, really, for a reason,"" Griffin said. ""It was a good test for us, the second time we played them on the second night of a back-to-back. But we've just got to be better.""","401160949"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  After spending most of the season struggling to find ways to win despite an inconsistent offense, scoring suddenly seems to come easily for the Orlando Magic. On Wednesday night, the Phoenix Suns witnessed that shift firsthand. Aaron Gordon scored a season-high 32 points, Terrence Ross had 22 and the Magic beat the Suns 128-114 at Amway Center. Evan Fournier added 21 points, and Markelle Fultz had 13 points, five assists and four rebounds for the Magic. Frank Kaminsky led the Suns with 23 points and five rebounds, and Devin Booker had 17 points and five assists. The Suns led by 10 points in the first half on the strength of a hot start from Kaminsky. He made nine of his first 10 shots and had 21 points by halftime. Gordon made a pair of 3-pointers to jump start a 14-1 run early in the third quarter. Fournier added a 3-pointer to punctuate the scoring spree, giving the Magic a 79-62 advantage. Gordon was 5 for 5 from 3-point range after entering the game shooting 28.4% from long range. ""Nobody expected him to shoot like that,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""But he's a good player, and you tip your hat to him. I thought we did not respect him enough."" ""It's just about relaxing and shooting my shot,"" Gordon surmised. That hot shooting trend held true for many of his teammates as well. After failing to shoot 50% from the field in any of its first 19 games, Orlando topped that mark for the second time in two nights. The Magic shot 57.6% from the field, topping their then season-best 51.1% in a 127-120 victory at Washington on Tuesday night. They scored more than 125 points for the second consecutive outing, a feat they have accomplished only two other times in franchise history. ""Our No. 1 weakness so far this year has been 3-point shooting. I believe we were 30th,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said of his team, which actually entered the game 29th in the NBA at 32.1% from 3-point range. ""Last year, I think we were 11th. We have good shooters getting into rhythm, and they're starting to shoot the ball better."" TIP INS: Suns: The Magic's 57.6% shooting was the worst defensive showing of the season for Phoenix, topping the 57.3% it allowed in a loss at Washington on Nov. 27 .... G Ricky Rubio started despite an injury to his left hand sustained on Monday night at Charlotte. Magic: G Michael Carter-Willams did not play due to a nasal contusion sustained when he caught an elbow from Washington's Bradley Beal on Tuesday night ... F Al-Farouq Aminu (torn right meniscus) is awaiting word on whether he will need surgery. FOUL TREATMENT: Booker spent several minutes on the bench receiving treatment on his back after taking a hard fall while scoring a layup that gave his team a 20-14 lead. He ultimately returned before halftime, but his coach was displeased a foul was not called on the play. ""He's tough. You guys have seen him,"" Williams said. ""I don't think he gets enough respect from the referees. What do you have to do? Get a tech, go act like you don't have any sense, for a guy to get a foul? That was a foul. We don't need to go to the league and have a conversation with them about it. That was a foul."" MORE FROM MO: While Gordon's torrid shooting pace stole the show, Mo Bamba quietly put together a double-double, finishing with 10 points and 11 rebounds in less than 19 minutes of action. His success on the glass helped lead the Magic to a 45-29 advantage in total rebounds. ""Tonight might have been his best game,"" Clifford said. ""He's in a routine and he does a good job with it. He's made good progress since last year.""","401160950"
"ATLANTA --  On a team that's undergone a full roster rebuild and endured significant injuries, Garrett Temple knew the Brooklyn Nets would need extra time to mesh. ""We had so many new guys,"" Temple said. ""On this team, our defensive principles are a little different than around the NBA. We have a very unique game plan a lot of the times. We are doing a great job out there, and guys are buying in."" Temple scored a season-high 27 points, Spencer Dinwiddie had 18 of his 24 in the second half and the Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 130-118 on Wednesday night. Taurean Prince finished with 23 points against his former team and Jarrett Allen had 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Nets, who were coming off a three-point home loss Sunday to Miami but have won six of eight despite not having injured stars Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Caris LeVert. Trae Young had 39 points and 10 assists and rookie Cam Reddish scored a career-high 25 points for Atlanta. The Hawks have lost 11 of 12. Reddish drove for a fast-break layup to cut the lead to eight with 8:49 remaining. But after a Nets timeout, Dinwiddie drove the left side for a basket that pushed the lead to 102-92, and Brooklyn wasn't threatened again. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce blamed his team's weak defense for the loss. ""We have to be into the ball a little bit more with pressure,"" Pierce said. ""We have to pressure their passers. It's whoever is on the court has to do a little bit better with regards to their responsibility."" Joe Harris' no-look pass from the top of the key to Allen for a dunk completed a 13-5 run that gave Brooklyn a 117-101 lead with 4:38 left in the game. The Nets took their first double-digit lead early in the third on Temple's 3. Dinwiddie went into attack mode, prioritizing drives to the lane that resulted in three baskets and two free throws that made it an 11-point lead. Harris scored inside to make it 80-67, and DeAndre Jordan pushed the lead back to 13 with a follow shot that caused a Hawks timeout. Dinwiddie quickly added another inside basket for his 12th point of the third to make it 86-75. Brooklyn matched his its previous high in offensive rebounds -- 18 against Indiana on Oct. 30 -- late in the third. The Nets led 56-47 at halftime. They outrebounded Atlanta by 12 and outscored the Hawks 17-7 in second-chance points before intermission. ""Dominating on the glass -- that's been a sticking point for us,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We've talked a lot about rebounding the last couple of days, how much that's hurt us. Collectively, I thought we got on the boards. Even in the first half when we were missing shots, I thought we cleaned up a lot of misses and it was a difference in the game."" TIP-INS Nets: Irving missed his 10th straight game with a right shoulder impingement and did not make the two-game road trip to stay home and rehab. ... Brooklyn has won five straight in the series and four in a row in Atlanta. ... The Nets had 10 of their 26 assists in the fourth. Hawks: F Kevin Huerter, returning after missing 11 games with a left rotator cuff strain, was on a 15-minute limit and was scoreless. ... F De'Andre Hunter, sidelined by a dislocated right index finger, missed his first game. DeAndre' Bembry started in his spot and had two points. ... G Allen Crabbe was out with right knee soreness. LAST MAN STANDING With the firing of New Jersey Devils coach John Hynes, Atkinson has the longest tenure of any coach or manager of a major pro sports team in the New York metropolitan area. This is the former Hawks assistant's fourth season. ""Coaching's a tough business,"" Atkinson said. ""I really don't know what to say. I don't know if it makes me proud or sad for the other guys but it's a tough business to survive in. Especially in New York."" HE'S BACK Prince received some warm applause after the Hawks showed a video tribute early in the first quarter to recognize his three seasons in Atlanta. The Nets acquired Prince in a June trade for Crabbe and a second-round pick. Prince starts at forward and is Brooklyn's fifth-leading scorer with a 13.0 average. Prince had no trouble getting movitated. ""One hundred percent,"" he said. ""Especially being the team that traded me away.""","401160951"
"BOSTON --  Jaylen Brown banked in a 3-pointer and blew a kiss to a former teammate. He wanted to remind old friend Kelly Olynyk that he can shoot from the outside. Brown scored a season-high 31 points, Kemba Walker had 28 and the Boston Celtics beat the Miami Heat 112-93 on Wednesday night. ""That was for Kelly. I don't know if he was over there,"" Brown said of his kiss. ""That's my guy. That was all love right there. I was showing some love. He said I was going to miss, so I sent some love over to him."" Brown said he's shown others ""some love"" after key shots. ""People say I'm a non-shooter when I make it, I guess that's my gift over to them,"" he said, smiling. Jayson Tatum added 19 points to help Boston improve to 8-0 at home. Brown connected on a season-high five 3-pointers, and Walker had seven assists and four rebounds with six shots made from beyond the arc. Jimmy Butler led the Heat with a season-high 37 points and had six rebounds and four assists. Olynyk, who played his final of four seasons in Boston with Brown, added 12 points, and Duncan Robinson and Justise Winslow each had 10. Miami had won three in a row. ""We didn't play together on either end -- defense, offense,"" Butler said. ""That's not how we've been winning games. That's one that we really wanted to win. I felt like we could have proved to ourselves how we're a good basketball team. I feel like we took a step back. Back to the drawing board."" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra left the team in the morning, flying home to be with wife Nikki for the birth of their second son. Assistant coach Dan Craig ran the team. ""Obviously, it was a big adjustment. You're going from that assistant chair to the head coach chair,"" Craig said. ""I'm just trying to juggle all that dynamics of what the head coach has to deal with before the game, in game, after game."" Brown hit two 3-pointers and Semi Ojeleye had one -- all coming from the left corner directly in front of the Heat bench just over a minute apart -- during a 9-1 spurt that pushed Boston's lead to 80-67 late in the third quarter. The Celtics led by 13 after three quarters. Boston then scored the first seven points of the fourth, making it 89-69 on Carsen Edwards' 3 from the right wing. Brown later banked in his 3 from the top of the key, making it 102-79 with 5:16 to play. TIP-INS Heat: Craig spent his high school years living about 40 minutes away from TD Garden in Chelmsford and rooting for the Celtics. ""It worked out kind of funny,"" he said before the game. ""I'm back home and I'm going to coach this game. It's pretty exciting."" Craig also ran the team in March of 2018 when Spoelstra was away for the birth of his first son. The Heat also lost that game. Celtics: Guard Marcus Smart missed the game due to illness. Coach Brad Stevens said he would have been ""doubtful"" with a sore oblique, but ""the illness knocked him out"" of playing. BEATING THEIR STRENGTH The Heat entered ranked second in the league defending the 3 at 31.2%, but Boston hit 16 of 41, connecting at a 39% mark. ""Our guys did a really good job of driving, kicking, moving the ball and finding the next guy,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""It all works together."" LEAD ERASED The Heat led by 11 points midway into the second quarter before the Celtics closed the half by scoring 26 of the final 33 points. Walker had nine of the points and Tatum eight in the spree over the final 7:09, including two shots from beyond the arc.","401160952"
"CHICAGO --  Although closing out games remains a struggle, the Chicago Bulls have hung on to win two straight after several losses in similar situations earlier in the season. Zach LaVine scored 25 points, Wendell Carter Jr. had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and Chicago beat the short-handed Memphis Grizzlies 106-99 on Wednesday night after nearly losing a 22-point lead. Lauri Markkanen had 15 points as the Bulls won consecutive games for the first time. Monday in Sacramento, the Bulls had a 19-point lead reduced to two late before winning 113-106. ""We gave up our lead again, but just like we did in Sacramento, we made big plays down the stretch,"" LaVine said. ""We kept our composure."" While happy with the wins, Chicago coach Jim Boylen hopes for more consistency to avoid the wild swings. ""We play good basketball for 12, 15 minutes, then we play five minutes of poor basketball,"" Boylen said. ""Then it flips. Now we've got to get back and re-engage, play good basketball again. ""We're learning how to do that. You've got to handle those spurts. You've got to try to get back in the flow. I thought in the last two games, we had enough plays to do that, settle down."" Jonas Valanciunas had 32 points and 13 rebounds, and Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jae Crowder each scored 15 points for Memphis, which has dropped eight of nine. Rookie Ja Morant, the Grizzlies' leading scorer at 18.6 points per game, missed his third straight game with back soreness. ""I was doing everything that I can,"" Valanciunas said. ""We need some wins. We've got to pull some out."" The Bulls scored the game's first seven points and had a 13-2 lead after four minutes. Scoring consistently was a problem for Memphis throughout the first half. Chicago had its biggest lead at 50-28 with 3 1/2 minutes to go in the second before the Grizzlies scored the final seven points of the quarter to make it 50-35 at halftime. LaVine opened the scoring in the third quarter to make it 52-35, but Memphis then ran off eight straight to pull within 52-43. A few minutes later, the Chicago lead was down to 61-55 following a five-point possession. De'Anthony Melton was fouled on a clear-path call and sank both free throws. After the Grizzlies inbounded the ball, Crowder hit a 3-pointer. That was as close as Memphis would get in the third. The Bulls closed the quarter with a 17-5 run for a 78-64 edge heading into the fourth. Chicago was leading 82-70 with 8 1/2 minutes remaining before the Grizzlies went on a 17-6 run to make it 88-87 with 4 1/2 minutes to play. LaVine, though, answered with five quick points and Kris Dunn hit a 3-pointer with 3 minutes left to get the lead back up to 96-87. The Bulls hung on from there. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Valanciunas returned after missing the previous two games with flu-like symptoms. Before the game, coach Taylor Jenkins thought he might have to limit his center's minutes, but he played 29 minutes, more than his season average of 24.6. ""I was winded,"" he said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Indiana Pacers added to Oklahoma City's growing collection of disappointing second halves. T.J. Warren scored 24 points to help Indiana beat the Thunder 107-100 on Wednesday night. Oklahoma City led by a point at halftime, but the Pacers outscored the Thunder 58-50 after the break. ""In the second half, we did a better job on both ends of the floor getting stops, continuing to move the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""I thought that in the first half, we played in traffic a little bit, but the second half, we had better ball movement and guys were able to knock down shots."" Domantas Sabonis added 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Pacers. They have won seven of eight. Eight of Oklahoma City's 12 losses have been by seven or fewer points. The Thunder have battled the better teams on the schedule but have squandered halftime leads against the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and Milwaukee Bucks. The third quarter has been particularly tough for Oklahoma City this season. ""Everyone out there is trying to do the right thing,"" Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari said. ""Whether it's adjustments we make at halftime or they (opponents) come in with a lot more pace or more emphasis on it than we do -- we're working on it."" Steven Adams scored 20 points on 8-for-8 shooting and Gallinari and Dennis Schroder each added 18 points for the Thunder. Gallinari made four 3-pointers in the first 5 1/2 minutes of the third quarter to help put the Thunder up 64-60. The Pacers rallied, and Justin Holiday's layup with less than a second left in the third quarter put the Pacers up 79-78. Indiana led 103-100 in the final minute of the fourth quarter and Oklahoma City had a chance to tie. Terrance Ferguson missed a 3-pointer from the corner with 17 seconds left, and Warren made two free throws at the other end with 13.2 seconds to go to put the Pacers in control for good. Oklahoma City decided against calling a timeout before Ferguson's three. ""I don't think you can draw something up and get a better look than we got,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""I told Ferg I want him to shoot that every night. That's what he does for us."" The Pacers expected a tough game from the Thunder, given their tendency to play close games. ""They've got good players over there,"" McMillan said. ""They have a good team and they've been playing good basketball."" TIP-INS Pacers: Starters Sabonis and Jeremy Lamb are former Thunder players who were cheered during pregame introductions. Lamb finished with 13 points. ... Another former Thunder player, Doug McDermott, also plays for the Pacers. He scored 14 points. ... Sabonis committed three fouls in a 23-second stretch in the fourth quarter. Thunder: G Andre Roberson is away from the team while recovering from his left knee injury. He has not played for nearly two years. There is no timetable for his return. ... Lost a coaches' challenge in the third quarter. ... Paul went scoreless the first three quarters and finished with 4 points on 2-for-9 shooting. STAT LINESAfter getting off to a rough start, Adams has been hot lately. The 7-foot center made all eight of his shots on Wednesday. He has made 14 of 15 in his past two games and 21 of 26 in his past three. He's averaging 16.3 points in those three games. ""I think he's kind of getting back to where he normally was, the guy we're used to seeing,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Everything for him looks a lot better."" OFF NIGHT Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who entered the night as Oklahoma City's No. 2 scorer for the season with 18.2 points per game, finished with 16 on 7-for-19 shooting. He made just 1 of 7 3-pointers. He was shooting 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from 3-point range before Wednesday night. HE SAID IT McMillan on handling late-game situations: ""I thought they had good pressure on the ball and we had to execute. We had to make plays down the stretch, setting screens and getting the ball to the open man. Those are things we've got to do to win ballgames.""","401160954"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks showed Wednesday night they are much more than Luka Doncic. Dwight Powell scored 24 points on 9-for-9 shooting from the field, Jalen Brunson ignited a fourth-quarter rally with 14 of his 16 points in the period and the Mavericks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 121-114. Powell and Brunson both had season highs as the Mavericks won for the ninth time in 10 games. Going into the second night of a back-to-back, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said, ""Depth is going to be our calling card if we're going to be good."" Then his team went out and proved his point on a night when Doncic struggled with 8-for-22 shooting and was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter. With five reserves on the floor to start the fourth quarter, Dallas was 7-of-9 on 3s after hitting only four of its first 27. Brunson made two, including the one that put Dallas ahead to stay at 94-93 with 7 minutes to play. ""A little opportunity. A little bit of preparation. I just felt it going,"" Brunson said. Maxi Kleber made two 3s and Justin Jackson another before Doncic came back into the game and made his only 3 off an assist from Brunson to put the Mavs up 106-98. Doncic, whose frustrations with the officiating boiled over when he was given a technical foul by referee David Guthrie with 2:26 left in the third quarter, looked skyward as if to show relief when the shot swished through. Doncic finished with 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists -- all below his season averages. It was the first time since Oct. 29 -- a stretch of 17 games -- when someone other than the 20-year-old standout led Dallas in scoring. ""We have amazing players on this team,"" Doncic said. ""Anybody can do anything."" Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins had 26 points apiece for the Timberwolves, and Robert Covington added 22. ""I think we played solid through three quarters,"" Wiggins said. ""But in the fourth quarter, we let them get too comfortable."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Forward Jake Layman remains out with a sprained big toe on his left foot. Coach Ryan Saunders said Layman was not with the team as it begins a four-game trip and didn't have a timetable for his return. Mavericks: Powell's 14 first-half points were a career high in a half for the sixth-year center and he finished just two short of his career high after leaving the game midway through the fourth quarter with a wrist injury. LUKA'S STREAK Calling this a below-average game for Doncic only emphasizes the impressive numbers he's put up in his second year. He is currently riding a streak of 17 consecutive games with at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists. That tied Russell Westbrook's streak as the second-longest since the ABA-NBA merger (1976-77). Only Michael Jordan (18 games in 1988-89) has a longer streak. ""When he's on the bench, he's up, cheering on his teammates with the best of them,"" Carlisle said of Doncic. ""He was really into the game when our second unit got it going in the fourth."" ROAD WARRIORS Minnesota had won four in a row on the road and was 7-2 away from Target Center entering Wednesday. The Wolves will need more road magic with this contest starting a stretch of eight road games in 11 days, all against Western Conference teams. ""We've got to find consistency playing for 48 (minutes),"" Towns said. POWELL BRUISED Powell finished just two short of a career high in points when he had to leave the game with 4:47 left in the fourth when he injured his left arm in a collision with Wiggins and his own teammate Kristaps Porzingis. He was diagnosed with an arm contusion and X-rays were negative. ""It was just a really awkward play,"" Powell said. ""I felt like my arm got stuck in a revolving door. It didn't feel good but thankfully it's not broken.""","401160955"
"LeBron James describes what happened on his travel that the referees missed in the first quarter of the Lakers-Jazz game. (0:36) SALT LAKE CITY --  The Los Angeles Lakers had plenty of energy left for the second night of a difficult back-to-back. Anthony Davis scored 26 points, LeBron James added 20 points and 12 assists for his 17th double-double in 22 games, and the Lakers dominated on both ends of the court in a 121-96 victory over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. A night after winning in Denver, the Lakers pushed the pace on offense and closed down passing lanes and contested shots even while leading by double digits throughout the second half. ""We knew we had to bring energy,"" James said. ""Even with a back-to-back, we still got to have energy and we got to push the pace. We're very good when we get stops and we run. ... It's very important for us to push the pace, but it starts with our defense and we got defensive stops."" Rajon Rondo paced a strong bench effort with 14 points, and season highs of 12 assists and eight rebounds. The Lakers burned the Jazz repeatedly in transition, outscoring Utah 32-5 in fast-break points. Much of that came as a result of high-energy defense. Los Angeles totaled 21 points off 19 Jazz turnovers. ""We've got a good team,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have high aspirations. We're trying to keep a game-to-game, stay-in-the-moment focus throughout the year."" Donovan Mitchell scored 29 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 23 for Utah. The Jazz lost for the fifth time in six games. Utah shot 45.2% from 3-point range but forced just seven turnovers -- a season-low for the Lakers -- and allowed Los Angeles to shoot 51% from the field and 48% from 3-point range. ""At the beginning of the year there was a determination and a focus defensively, and it showed,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""More recently, we've allowed other things, whether it be a missed shot, perception of a bad call, a turnover -- everything is lingering. Our inability to get to the next play has hurt our defense."" The Jazz opened the game with baskets on four straight possessions and took an 11-5 lead. Bogdanovic got things going with back-to-back 3-pointers. Utah eventually cooled down. Los Angeles did not. Behind a 9-0 run, the Lakers surged out to a 30-20 lead. Davis scored back-to-back baskets to punctuate the run. Los Angeles was just getting started. The Lakers used a 16-4 run, sparked by a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter from Kyle Kuzma, to stake out a 46-30 lead early in the second quarter. James fueled the bulk of the run with three baskets over a minute. ""We've got to come in and look at ourselves in the mirror, and there's stuff we've got to do better,"" Mitchell said. ""We've got to hold each other accountable when it's necessary."" Los Angeles maintained a double-digit lead throughout the second half. The Lakers led by as many as 25 points after halftime. Utah shot 50% from the field in the third quarter and trimmed the deficit to 68-57 on a runner from Jeff Green. That's as close as the Jazz got. Los Angeles countered with a 10-2 run capped off by JaVale McGee's alley-oop dunk to go up 78-59 midway through the quarter. ""We've been struggling coming out in the third quarter, giving teams more life,"" Davis said. ""We gave it up a little bit tonight and then we kind of found it again."" TIP-INS Lakers: Dwight Howard made his first 3-pointer of the season with 6:25 left in the fourth quarter. ... Los Angeles outscored the Jazz 52-34 in the paint. . The Lakers are 12-1 this season when outscoring their opponent in fast-break points. Jazz: Mike Conley missed his first game of the season (left hamstring tightness). Mitchell started at point guard in Conley's place with Joe Ingles starting at shooting guard. ... Rudy Gobert had 10 rebounds. BLOCK PARTY Davis finished with three blocked shots. All three blocks came during the third quarter. His first one provided the biggest highlight when he ran past Bogdanovic, changed direction, and recovered to block the Jazz forward's attempted 3-pointer. Davis made a tough play look simple and, in the process, summed up for his teammates where he is at defensively early in the season. ""It's not hard (to block that shot) when you're defensive player of the year,"" James said. STREAK BUSTED It was James' first win in Utah since Dec. 8, 2010.","401160956"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  CJ McCollum was confident it would all start to come together. McCollum scored 33 points and the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away in the final quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 127-116 on Wednesday night. It was McCollum's 10th straight game with 20 or more points, tying a career high. That's a trend upward from the start of the season, when he struggled in a few games. I know who I am as a basketball player. I know what I'm capable of doing. My body of work proves itself, it shows who I am as a basketball player,"" he said. So if I have two or three poor games, poor shooting nights, I don't get discouraged because it's an 82-game season. Hassan Whiteside added 22 points and 16 rebounds, as well as a career-high seven assists. Damian Lillard had 24 points and 10 assists in Portland's third straight win at the Moda Center. Carmelo Anthony finished with 20 points, his fourth game with 20 or more in seven games with the Blazers. Richaun Holmes had 28 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings. They made some shots to kind of break our backs there in the fourth quarter but I feel like we competed all the way through, Holmes said. Kent Bazemore's corner 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 108-101 lead early in the final quarter. Lillard's 31-footer made it 113-105 with 6:46 left. Bazemore had another 3-pointer that gave the Blazers their biggest lead of the game to that point, 119-108 with 4:28 remaining. The Blazers were playing the second of a back-to-back. They lost on the road to the Clippers 117-97 on Tuesday night, snapping a three-game winning streak. Portland has been boosted by the addition of Anthony, who was chosen the Western Conference player of the week for averaging 22.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists over the three-game winning streak. Anthony's strong return after being out of the NBA for more than a year has been a surprise to some. But the 10-time All-Star seems to have meshed well in Portland. Sacramento was without guard Bogdan Bogdanovic because of a knee contusion. He's also dealing with a hamstring injury. Bogdanovic is averaging 14.8 points, 2.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists this season. A 10-0 run at the end of the first quarter put the Kings up 28-26 but Anthony's jumper ended it. Buddy Hield had 14 points as Sacramento closed out the period ahead 35-30. McCollum made four straight field goals for 10 points, pulling Portland within 43-42. The Blazers had a 66-64 lead at the half, led by McCollum with 23 points. He also had career-high four blocks, all in the first half. McCollum's 3-pointer gave the Blazers an 83-80 lead. Anthony added another 3 to extend it. Sacramento kept kept it close and briefly re-took the lead, but Portland led 100-95 heading into the final quarter. Lillard said the team tightened up its defense in the final quarter. I think it was obvious that it wasn't good enough the first three quarters or so. The fourth quarter, we stepped it up and that was when we won the game, he said. Portland has won 12 straight over the Kings at the Moda Center. It was the third of four meetings between the teams this season. They split the previous two. TIP-INS Kings: The Kings continue to play without DeAaron Fox (ankle) and Marvin Bagley III (thumb), although Bagley is expected to return soon.  You don't want any of your guys to get hurt, but a lot of what we built we built around having certain guys, and they haven't been with us,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. That's why I go back to giving our guys credit. They've adjusted, they've adapted, continued to work. ... It was the first of a four-game road trip for the Kings, who play their next three in Texas. ... Hield finished with 23 points. Trail Blazers: It was the start of a four-game homestand for Portland. ... Whiteside's double-double was his 13th this season. ... Anfernee Simons fouled out with 11:17 left in the game. It was the first time he'd fouled out in his NBA career. ... Blazers coach Terry Stotts said Rodney Hood was bothered by an Achilles injury. Hood finished with six points. ABOUT THOSE BLOCKS McCollum finished with four, a career high. I'll be at the rim every now and then. Being a rim protector, helping people's fantasy teams,"" he joked.","401160957"
"WASHINGTON --  Well, at least give Ben Simmons and the rest of the Philadelphia 76ers credit for honesty. They didn't try to hide from the fact that they were sloppy with the ball -- to the tune of 21 turnovers, a combined 15 from Simmons and Joel Embiid -- or that their defense was half-hearted -- they let one opponent make his first half-dozen 3-point attempts -- or that their overall showing was, to use Tobias Harris' word, Terrible. As well as the Sixers have been playing at home lately, they just can't consistently get their act together on the road, and the latest disappointment for a team that has serious aspirations for the postseason was a 119-113 loss at the struggling Washington Wizards on Thursday night. I just think, Simmons said, we came in too relaxed. The Sixers dropped to 5-7 away from Philadelphia -- where they are 10-0 this season -- despite 33 points from Harris, 26 points and a season-best 21 rebounds from Embiid, and 17 points and 10 assists from Simmons. I didnt think we responded well at all. I thought that it took us about 36 minutes, 38 minutes, to come with an energy that we have been playing with,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Facing one of the most lax defenses in the NBA, Embiid had eight turnovers and Simmons seven. The Wizards ended up converting all of the turnovers into 30 points, quite a gift for a team that lost five of six games entering the night. There was just a lot of bad turnovers all around, Harris said. Its something thats been hurting us all year. Weve known that. Rookie Rui Hachimura scored 27 for Washington, Bradley Beal had 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Davis Bertans scored 19 of his season-high 25 points in the second quarter. In the first half, he shot 8 for 8 overall, 6 for 6 on 3s, and totaled 22 points. ""Hes the best shooter that Ive ever seen,"" Hachimura said. The 76ers have lost 10 games in a row at Washington; their last victory in the nation's capital came on Nov. 1, 2013. Still, the Wizards started this one about as poorly as possible at the offensive end, missing their first five shots and turning the ball over twice before finally making a basket after nearly 4 minutes. Raul Neto hit 3s on consecutive trips down the court to put the Sixers ahead 33-22 late in the first quarter. Bertans took over in the second, though, scoring 12 points in a row for Washington in one stretch and sparking a 16-2 run. Kind of a punch in the face for them, Bertans said. TIP-INS 76ers: Had won eight of their last nine games. ... G Josh Richardson missed his fourth consecutive game because of right hamstring tightness. A hamstring is one of those things where you think that youre fine and you take one wrong step and its a week or two-week setback, Richardson said. ""I dont really want to get in that whole scenario. ... Made 8 of 14 attempts on 3s in the first half, 5 of 14 in the second. Wizards: Washington got back two reserve centers Thursday after injury absences: Ian Mahinmi (right Achilles) made his season debut, getting seven points and five rebounds in 13 minutes; Moe Wagner (left ankle) returned after missing two games and had five points and 11 rebounds. SO MANY INJURIES Washington's roster has been injury-depleted all season so far, most prominently missing All-Star point guard John Wall. Each day seems to bring more bad news, and Thursday was no different: Point guard Isaiah Thomas was a late scratch with a bad calf, while guard-forward Jordan McRae was ruled out for no less than two weeks because of a right finger problem. Others unavailable at the moment include starting center Thomas Bryant and forward C.J Miles.","401160958"

Denver's backups scored 74 points, with five double-digit scorers. ""We know our second unit is huge for us,"" Nuggets reserve Juancho Hernangomez said. ""We know what we can do.

""I thought that group as great. Everyone contributed. Everyone stepped up. So, it's a good way to start off the road trip."" The Nuggets used a 17-1 run to take a 67-45 halftime lead. Mitchell Robinson had 17 points and Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis each added 10 for New York. The Knicks have lost eighth straight. Denver led by 43 points in the fourth quarter.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Monty Williams was able to celebrate a victory in an emotional return to New Orleans. The former New Orleans coach guided the Phoenix Suns to a 139-132 overtime victory over the Pelicans on Thursday night. Devin Booker broke out of a perimeter-shooting slump, scoring 21 of his season-high 44 points in the third quarter, and Ricky Rubio powered the Phoenix Suns with four points and a critical assist in overtime. Williams and late wife Ingrid raised five children in New Orleans and built a core of friends despite the team's mediocre results through his final season in 2014-15. When Ingrid was killed in a car wreck in 2016 in Oklahoma City, where Williams had become an assistant coach, it was Williams' friends in New Orleans who helped him cope with the loss of his spouse. ""It's a big win to come back here for the first time as a head coach and win in overtime,"" Williams said. ""I hate those situations because I was sweating like you know what, but it was pretty cool to come back here and win. And, now, I get to go outside and see some people who really care about me."" Williams thought it might have been a pushover when the Suns led 105-85 early in the fourth quarter. But playing the back end of a back-to-back, Phoenix seemed to lose energy and the Pelicans fought back with five 3-pointers, two by the normally scatter-shooting Lonzo Ball, to tie it at 125. The Pelicans had a chance to win in regulation, but Brandon Ingram missed a 15-foot jumper from the right baseline as time expired. In overtime, Ingram's conventional three-point play tied it at 129, but Ricky Rubio hit a 12-footer and a scoop in the lane and then added a no-look assist to put the Suns up 135-129. Rubio finished with 15 assists. New Orleans got to 135-132 on JJ Redick's 3-pointer with 56.5 left, but Frank Kaminsky, who had six points in the overtime, iced it with two free throws. Kaminsky finished with 20 points, and Kelly Oubre had 14 points and 15 rebounds. Booker made Williams' homecoming successful. ""Just recently in the past three games we've been slow out of halftime,"" Booker said. ""We made it a point at halftime that coming out we needed to be better, so I just tried to out my foot down on that, come out with energy and be aggressive, and it worked well for us."" The Suns led 74-70 at halftime and then took control by opening the third quarter on a 16-3 run. New Orleans, which lost its seventh consecutive game, had four players with at least 20 points: Redick with 26, Jrue Holiday with 23, Ingram with 21 and Ball with 20 and 11 assists. ""I thought we did a good job,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said bounced back. It was our defense. We were locked in, and we were guarding."" TIP-INS Suns: Aron Baynes sat out with a left calf strain. Pelicans: Executive vice president David Griffin said the team will be exceedingly careful with No. 1 pick Zion Williams, who has been sidelined for six weeks since arthroscopic knee surgery. ""If we get outside the eight weeks, it's because he didn't meet the (knee-strength) metrics,"" Griffin said.","401160961"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Seven months ago, Brooklyn Nets sharpshooter Joe Harris won the NBA All-Star Weekend 3-point contest at the Spectrum Center. On Friday night, Harris was at it again by scoring 22 points and hitting six 3-pointers as the Nets continued their recent strong play in road games with a 111-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The Nets (12-10) won for the fifth time in their last six road games, all while playing without injured point guard Kyrie Irving. DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 13 rebounds, Taurean Prince also scored 16 points, while Jarrett Allen had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie finished with 12 assists. ""Yeah, you know it's a little bit different set up than the 3-point contest but tonight the ball was moving early. A lot of guys were knocking down shots and shooting is kind of one of the things where it's contagious,"" said Harris, whose team hit 15 of 38 3-pointers overall. ""You know, once guys start seeing it go down, everybody else starts to feel that and we had a lot of confidence early shooting from 3."" Charlotte controlled much of the opening half, twice building seven-point leads before taking a 57-55 lead into the break. In the third quarter, the Nets built a 75-66 lead with 4:41 left. Brooklyn took its first double-figure lead at 95-84 after Theo Pinson's three-point play with 7:36 to play before leading by as many as 14 points. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson liked his team's offensive efficiency but felt his team's defense at the start of the fourth quarter led by his backups sealed the victory. ""Just that second unit I thought was fantastic,"" said Atkinson, whose team limited Charlotte to 20 fourth-quarter points. It ""started with Shump (Iman Shumpert) and then David Nwaba, I thought it was really good and then DeAndre Jordan was incredible tonight. They really picked it up and got our energy going. It really turned the game. Again, I thought that Shump was key there."" Now winners of seven of their last nine overall, Atkinson thought that recent strong play helped the Nets' overcome a sluggish first half. ""Their chemistry is really good right now,"" Atkinson said of his team. ""They are talking about coverages, and encouraging each other. Even in the first half when it didn't go so well they were together. Sometimes coaches will get negative. (But) they are pushing each other and their chemistry is great right now."" Devonte' Graham' scored 29 points for the Hornets. Graham, Charlotte's leading scorer at 18.7 points per game, bruised his left shoulder a minute into Friday's game but returned to action in the second quarter and eventually made 8 of 19 shots, going 6 of 11 on 3-pointers. Terry Rozier III added 24 points, Cody Zeller 17 and P.J. Washington 14 for Charlotte. ""It was bothering me a little bit at first,"" Graham said of his injured shoulder. ""But I just had to stop thinking about it and just go out and hoop."" Charlotte coach James Borrego was disappointed in his team's 19 turnovers that led to 32 Nets' points. The Hornets had committed 13 or less turnovers in five of its last six games. The ""poor fourth quarter start,"" Borrego said. ""That did us in. (We) couldn't score and then we were turning it over. We were handing them points off our offense. So it was a combination. We went dry, turned it over and ... lots of the fourth quarter was not great. Then the biggest line was 19 turnovers for 32 points."" TIP-INS: Nets: Irving missed his 11th straight game witb a right shoulder impingement. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game there was no injury status update for Irving. Hornets: Entering Friday's games, Charlotte's guard duo of Rozier and Graham had made a combined 144 3-pointers. That ranked them tied for second in the NBA behind Houston's duo of James Harden and Ben McLemore (148). FANS OF FIZDALE Both Borrego and Atkinson were surprised and disappointed to hear about David Fizdale being fired as New York Knicks coach earlier Friday. Borrego has long roots with Fizdale, with whom he worked on his first coaching job in 2001 at the University of San Diego when both were assistant coaches. ""It's a tough day,"" Borrego said. ""Fiz is a friend and someone I have great respect for. It's just a tough day."" Said Atkinson: ""It doesn't make you feel good as a colleague and a friend. I know it's part of the business but he's a good coach.""","401160962"
"CLEVELAND --  The Orlando Magic spent last season climbing back to relevance. They're at it again. Terrence Ross scored 21 points, Evan Fournier added 18 and Aaron Gordon had a big dunk in the final 20 seconds to lead the Magic to their fourth straight win, 93-87 Friday night over the slumping Cleveland Cavaliers, who have dropped four in a row and 11 of 12. Orlando opened the season 2-6, but in winning five of six, the Magic, who had a 17-game improvement in 2018 after winning just 25 games the previous year, reached .500 for the first time. ""It's good we've gotten back there after the way we started, but time will tell how good we are,"" said Ross, who made two 3-pointers early in the fourth. ""We've got three tough games coming up that will test us."" The Magic face a brutal stretch over the next week, playing at Milwaukee and home against the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston. Collin Sexton scored 19 points and Cedi Osman 14 for Cleveland, which pulled within 90-87 on rookie Darius Garland's jumper with 42.5 seconds left. The Cavs needed a defensive stop on Orlando's next trip, but instead they gave up a dunk on a baseline out of bounds play with just three seconds left on the 24-second shot clock to Gordon, who managed to get free in the lane and scored over Tristan Thompson. On Cleveland's next possession, Larry Nance Jr. threw away the ball trying to hit Sexton on the opposite wing, ending the Cavs' last chance at a comeback. Orlando's surge has come without center Nikola Vucevic, who missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ""Once the big guy comes back, we'll be even more dangerous,"" Fournier said. ""We need to keep the same intensity and focus we're playing with now."" Despite another loss, first-year coach John Beilein saw enough positives to feel good about his young squad, which is going through some expected growing pains that are hurting more than expected. ""It reminded me a lot of what we were playing like at the beginning of the year,"" Beilein said. ""We were gritty. We were tough. Just played really hard, something the coaching staff has been working with them on the last couple of weeks."" Cleveland was without star forward Kevin Love, who has been battling a flu bug the past few days and stayed home to rest. The Cavs are hoping Love will be available Saturday in Philadelphia. Love recently missed three games with a bruised back and his name is already surfacing in trade rumors. CHEAP SHOTS Before the game, Beilein addressed a report that players have complained about his coaching style. The Athletic, quoting anonymous Cleveland players, said Beilein's methods are not working and they've begun tuning him out. The former Michigan coach believes he has his player's attention and said they've been receptive. ""We really had more than one of them, two, three, four we've met with and it's like, `Coach, keep doing what you're doing because we really need this. We need accountability, we need to play harder, stronger, tougher. Don't stop what you're doing."" ""I have a lot of confidence the guys in the locker room are on board, and they've told me that."" COACH'S BACKING Magic coach Steve Clifford offered his unsolicited support of Beilein. ""I've known coach Beilein longer than anybody,"" he said. ""He's a phenomenal coach and he's won at every level. This league is a tough league. All I know is he'll find a way to win. It's not easy to do and there is very little growth at any level in any team sport without any conflict. ""When a guy says something behind the scenes and they won't own it, as a coach, it gets very frustrating."" TIP-INS Magic: Gordon sat out Orlando's win over Cleveland on Nov. 27 with an ankle injury. ... F Jonathan Isaac had four of Orlando's nine blocks. ... Browns defensive coordinator Steve Wilks visited Clifford following the game. They became friends when Wilks worked for the Carolina Panthers.

"DETROIT --  Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey knew his teams fourth game against the Indiana Pacers was going to be just as physical as the first three. He also knew Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond could give the Pistons a big edge in that aspect of the game. Drummond had 25 points and 22 rebounds, Griffin scored 25 points and made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 41 seconds left, and the Pistons beat the Pacers 108-101 on Friday. We knew this was going to be a playoff-style game, and the way we played down the stretch was indicative of how we wanted to approach this one, Casey said. We were boxing out, we were hitting guys and if we got a foul, it was a hard foul. It wasnt anything dirty, just good physical basketball. Detroit led by 11 at the half, but was outscored 31-16 in the third quarter. Drummond felt it was a small victory to only trail 75-71 going into the fourth. They are a really good team and we knew they were going to get back into the game, he said. We really did a job sustaining ourselves during their run and only being down four going into the fourth. Then we played our (butts) off. The Pistons had a 25-2 edge in second-chance points, including 12-0 in the fourth quarter. Andre was a monster down the stretch, Casey said. It wasnt a pretty game, but he had 25 and 22 and what Im proud about, the second-chance points. That was huge. Derrick Rose had 14 points and set up Griffins go-ahead shot. The Pistons have won three of four. T.J. Warren scored 26 points and Domantas Sabonis added 18 points and 13 rebounds for Indiana. The Pacers lost for the second time in nine games. It was execution, Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Its always about execution. We didnt get stops when we needed them and when we did force a miss, they got the offensive rebound. The Pistons took a 99-97 lead on Luke Kennards jumper with 1:55 to play. After Malcolm Brogdon split a pair of free throws, Drummond committed his fifth foul to put Sabonis on the line. He also went 1 for 2, tying the game with 1:22 to play. Rose and Warren traded short jumpers, making it 101-all, and Griffin took a kick-out from Rose to hit the 3-pointer that gave the Pistons the lead. We practice that play all the time, using a bunch of different people, Casey said. Derrick ran it just like we drew it up. Brogdon turned the ball over under pressure from Bruce Brown and Rose iced it with a pair of jumpers. (Rose) was MVP for a reason, Griffin said. Hes very poised with the ball in hands and he doesnt get rattled, especially late in the game. The Pistons won the season series 3-1. We worked harder on the defensive end and started making some shots to get ourselves back into the third quarter, McMillan said. But I thought they were the aggressors all night long. They seemed to want it a little more and they got a 37-point fourth quarter. TIP INS Pacers: Indiana outshot the Pistons 59% to 28% as it got back into the game in the third quarter. ... Victor Oladipos knee injury means he wont play against the Pistons in the regular season. Pistons: Drummonds 20-20 game was the 37th of his career, trailing only Dwight Howard (51) among active players. WINNING THE GAME ON THE BOARDS Detroits 25-2 edge in second-chance points stemmed from their dominance of the boards on both ends. The Pistons grabbed 88% of Indianas missed shots and 33% of their own, then upped that to 90% and 60% in the fourth quarter. Theyre a really physical team, so we knew we had to bring our A game, Drummond said.","401160964"
"BOSTON --  It's been a long time since Boston fans went home unhappy. The Celtics remained perfect at home for the season, getting 26 points from Jayson Tatum and 21 from Jaylen Brown to beat the Denver Nuggets 108-95 on Friday night. Boston is 9-0 at the TD Garden, prolonging a city-wide streak in which none of the pro teams has lost a home game in regulation all fall. ""It's a special city to play in and a special city to coach in,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""Our No. 1 objective was to be a team Boston liked. Hopefully we've achieved that."" No Boston team has gone home empty-handed since the Red Sox lost to the Baltimore Orioles on Sept. 28. The Patriots are 5-0 at home this season, and the Bruins are 12-0-5. (The Revolution won their last home game on Sept. 29, and the Pride of the National Women's Hockey League are 9-0 at home.) ""Hopefully, none of us lose at home,"" said guard Kemba Walker, who scored 19 to help the Celtics win for the fifth time in six games. Nikola Jokic had 30 points and 10 rebounds for Denver, which has lost three of its last four. ""We're not playing well at all. We're playing really bad, and we are second in the West,"" guard Jamal Murray said. ""So imagine when we start playing well."" TIP-INS: Nuggets: Gary Harris hit his 500th career 3-pointer. Celtics: Stevens said injured forward Gordon Hayward will return to practice on Sunday and be ready to play before Christmas. ... Marcus Smart returned after missing one game with an oblique injury and illness. Every fan at the game received a poster of him. He had nine points in 28 minutes. ... Retired Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was sitting courtside. ... The Celtics and Nuggets were back together for the first time since Nov. 22, when Walker had a head-to-torso collision with teammate Semi Ojeleye. Walker was taken off on a stretcher, but he missed only one game with a neck injury. FIRE AND ICE Brown, who was the third overall pick in the 2016 draft, and Tatum, who went No. 3 overall the following year, have different personal and playing styles that are increasingly complementing each other on the court. ""I guess we feed off each other,"" Brown said. ""It's like fire and ice."" SLUMP BUSTER Jokic went six games without hitting a 3-pointer, missing 16 in a row dating to Nov. 20. He was 1 for 5 on Friday night, making one in the fourth quarter. In all, he was 13 for 21 from the field. ""Seeing Nikola play the way he did tonight is a small victory for us,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""I remind everybody, he set the bar so damn high last year in the playoffs that everyone expects brilliance every night and that's a lot to ask for a young kid. Tonight was an example of him getting back to who he is and playing the game."" PULLING AWAY Boston made the first two baskets of the game and never trailed, leading by as many as 10 points in the first quarter and 15 in the second. The Celtics led 74-64 with less than two minutes left in the third when they ran off the last 11 points of the quarter, including six by Brown and a step-back 3-pointer by Tatum in the final seconds. ""Me and my teammates, we didn't play very much defense,"" Jokic said. ""It seems like it was too easy for them.""","401160965"
"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler scored 28 points and had his second triple-double of the week, Bam Adebayo had a career-high 24 points and the Miami Heat beat the Washington Wizards 112-103 on Friday night. Butler finished with 11 assists and 11 rebounds for Miami, which is 9-0 at home for the first time in franchise history. Tyler Herro scored 22 points and Adebayo grabbed 13 rebounds for the Heat. Bradley Beal scored 23 points for Washington, including a 3-pointer late to get the Wizards to 95-94. Butler answered that with a 3-pointer to give the Heat some breathing room, then connected on another 3 with 1:04 left to put Miami up 111-103. Moritz Wagner had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards, while Davis Bertans scored 19 points and added nine rebounds. The Wizards took a 40-29 lead early in the second quarter -- significant because it was the first time this season that Miami trailed by double digits at home. The Heat trailed Memphis by eight in the season-opener on Oct. 23, then basically cruised in most of their other games facing nary a deficit along the way. This time, they had to work all the way to the end -- yet found a way. Duncan Robinson's 3-pointer off Butler's 10th assist put the Heat up by seven with about 3:30 left, and back-to-back jumpers by Butler essentially put the game away. The Heat trailed 65-61 at the half, then held Washington to 38 points in the final two quarters. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington has scored 100 or more points in 19 consecutive games, the franchise's second-longest streak in the last 30 years. It had a 23-game run from Jan. 3 through Feb. 24, 2017. ... Bertans has 16 games with at least three 3-pointers made this season. The only players with more are Houston's James Harden and Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns, both with 17. Heat: Adebayo's previous career best was 22. ... Butler had a special guest at the game -- his former coach in Chicago, Tom Thibodeau. ... Friday started the first of two different four-game homestands for the Heat in December. They have a season-best five-game homestand from Feb. 26 through March 4. INJURY WATCH Washington played without Ian Mahinmi (right Achilles/injury management) and Isaiah Thomas (left calf strain). The Heat were without Goran Dragic (right groin strain), Justise Winslow (back strain) and Dion Waiters (illness). Waiters still has not played this season. BABY SPO Heat coach Erik Spoelstra and wife Nikki welcomed their second son, Dante Nicholas, into the world this week. Spoelstra missed Wednesday's game in Boston but was back Friday -- with all well on the home front. ""My wife and I are thrilled. Everybody's healthy. Everybody's home,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's been a crazy 48 hours, to say the least. But we're all home and the house is a little bit louder than it was before.""","401160966"
"CHICAGO --  Draymond Green is finally getting to see Glenn Robinson III's complete game. Robinson scored the go-ahead basket and finished with 20 points to help the Golden State Warriors rally past the Chicago Bulls 100-98 on Friday night. The Warriors beat the Bulls for the second time this season, their only victories in the last nine games. Golden State escaped when Zach Lavine missed a 3-pointer in the final seconds, and Green secured the rebound. Alec Burks added 14 points, and Green had eight points, seven rebounds, and four assists. The Warriors rallied from a nine-point deficit early in the fourth quarter. Green finally tied it at 92 with a runner in the lane, and Willie Cauley-Stein had a layup to put the Warriors up 94-92 with 5:32 left. Green found Cauley-Stein for an alley-oop dunk to put the Warriors up 97-94, but Lauri Markkanen answered with a 3 for the Bulls to tie it. After Green and LaVine both split a pair free throws, Green found Robinson for another slam to give the Warriors a 100-98 lead with 1:03 left. ""I've watched him for years, dating back to his days at Michigan and even his time in the league,"" Green said. ""He was always hampered by injuries, so you kind of see glimpses here and there, but never with any consistency because he was always hurt. I think he's got an opportunity this year and he's been healthy and that's the key and he's played really well."" It took the last game of a five-game trip to get a win. ""We wanted to go home with a win and we thought it was a winnable game,"" Green said. Markkanen finished with 20 points and LaVine had 21. The Bulls had won two in a row. ""It needs to be more of the 48 (minutes),""Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""That's the development part. So as much as I like some of those moments, there are moments when we've got to do better."" Chicago's Denzel Valentine was ejected with 7:50 left for his second technical. Valentine was jawing at the Warriors from the bench when he was issued his second technical. Valentine and Omari Spellman were given double technicals late in the third quarter. Valentine finished with 11 points off the bench. He scored eight points in the second half. ""The game of basketball was taken away from me for a year (because of ankle surgery). I'm just playing with passion and emotion. And that's what I did tonight,"" Valentine said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder had found multiple ways to lose close games this season. Not this time. Chris Paul scored a season-high 30 points and Oklahoma City pulled off an improbable 139-127 overtime victory over the Timberwolves on Friday night. With Minnesota ahead 121-119 and 1.1 seconds remaining in regulation, Oklahoma City fouled Karl-Anthony Towns. He missed a free throw, then Minnesota was issued a technical foul for a delay of game because Jordan Bell did not have his jersey tucked in when he subbed in. It was a technical because the Timberwolves had been called for delay of game late in the third quarter, and a technical is given on a second delay of game. Danilo Gallinari made the technical free throw for Oklahoma City, then Towns shot his second free throw at the other end. He made it, putting Minnesota up two but giving Oklahoma City a chance at a throw-in. The Thunder would have had to scramble if Towns had missed because they were out of timeouts. Steven Adams took advantage of the unexpected opportunity and completed a nearly length-of-the-court pass to Dennis Schroder, who made a layup as time expired to force overtime. It left the Thunder celebrating and the Timberwolves stunned. ""I ain't ever been part of something like that,"" Towns said. ""I've been a part of a lot of basketball games in my life, but I've never seen something like that happen . just the execution of everything going down."" Bell was in no mood to discuss it after the game. He walked past a group of reporters and said, ""I'll save my money."" Towns said he was trying to miss the second free throw, but that -- and everything else -- went haywire in that final sequence during regulation. Oklahoma City was prepared. ""We actually practiced that specific situation a lot in practice, and to see it pay off is good,"" sad Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored 29 points. Oklahoma City outscored the Timberwolves 17-5 in the extra period. ""We knew once we made the shot, we had a lot more work to do, and we were willing to do whatever it took to win,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. Schroder scored 25 points, Adams had 22 points and 11 rebounds, and Gallinari scored 21 points for the Thunder. Jeff Teague scored a season-high 32 points, and Towns added 30 for the Timberwolves. Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said Minnesota played well enough to win. ""We're going to pick ourselves up and be better,"" he said. ""But it hurts."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Andrew Wiggins sat out with a left thumb sprain. Wiggins averages 24.9 points per game. ... Committed 13 fouls in the third quarter. ....

According to the Thunder, it was the first time that has happened for any NBA team since the Atlanta Hawks did it in 2004. ""Oh wow,"" Paul said. ""That's sick. I didn't know that.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo had plenty of time to relax and enjoy his 25th birthday Friday night against the Los Angeles Clippers. Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 11 rebounds before exiting the game with 8:56 to play and his Milwaukee Bucks ahead by 36. The Bucks went on to win 119-91 and capture their 14th straight victory. ""The fans were unbelievable tonight,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""They made me feel special. They made this day feel special. Usually a lot of people, their birthday, they celebrate, they go out, they do all that. But that's not me. That's not what I do. But the fans made it really special for me."" The reigning MVP made 11 of 20 shots and recorded his 21st double-double of the season. ""It was Giannis' birthday and we searched all over the city to find a gift and we couldn't find one, so we gave him this one,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""That's all I can come up with because we were awful."" The Bucks led by as many as 41 and extended their longest winning streak since winning 16 consecutive games over two seasons in 1973. Khris Middleton added 17 points and Pat Connaughton and Ersan Ilyasova each scored 13 off the bench for Milwaukee. Rivers pulled all of his key players out of the game with the Bucks leading 101-67 with 9:25 remaining in the fourth quarter. The group exited to the chant of ""Overrated! Overrated!"" from the Milwaukee crowd. ""We were just still stagnant at the beginning of the fourth,"" Kawhi Leonard said. ""We weren't really running anything, not executing. Coming down, taking shots early with no passes. So, I mean, I understand why he pulled us. Plus the lead was up high and we really didn't have no type of momentum."" Leonard had 17 points and Paul George added 13 for the Clippers. Friday night was the first time Leonard and Antetokounmpo faced each other since the Eastern Conference finals in May, when Leonard's Toronto Raptors beat Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in six games en route to winning the NBA championship. Leonard said the biggest difference between Antetokounmpo then and now is he's shooting the ball with more confidence. Antetokounmpo agreed. ""Obviously, yes, I'm a little more confident with my jump shot,"" he said. ""I believe in myself more. I think my teammates believe in me even more this year. But I'm just aggressive. Since the year started, I've been on a mission to help my team win every night and I think I've stayed on that path."" Milwaukee led 30-15 after the first quarter, with Middleton scoring 10 points in the opening frame. The Bucks held a 52-43 advantage at the break. After scoring 10 points in the first half, Antetokounmpo dropped 10 in the first 4:13 of the third quarter to help the Bucks outscore the Clippers 35-19 in the period. Milwaukee dominated Los Angeles inside, outscoring the Clippers 58-38 in the paint. ""They were so much more physical than us. It was not even close,"" Rivers said. JaMychal Green missed his second straight game for Los Angeles after suffering a bruised tailbone last Friday night against the San Antonio Spurs. TIP-INS Clippers: Leonard and George practiced together for the first time as teammates on Thursday in Milwaukee. ""It was nice we could run some end-of-the game stuff against live defense,"" Rivers said. ""When you messed it up, you had a chance to correct it. I could share what I was looking for and they could share what they liked. We've not had the opportunity to do that."" Bucks: Milwaukee completed the season sweep of the Clippers. Antetokounmpo was an assist shy of a triple-double (38 points, 16 rebounds) in a 129-124 win in Los Angeles on Nov. 6. Neither George nor Leonard played that night.","401160969"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Enduring a dismal start to the season allowed the Spurs to see the beauty in an ugly victory. LaMarcus Aldridge had 19 points and 13 rebounds in his return from an injury and San Antonio rallied from nine points down in the final 1:50 of regulation before beating the Sacramento Kings 105-104 in overtime on Friday night. The Kings missed four shots on their final possession of overtime, including a pair of 3-point attempts by Trevor Ariza. ""It's definitely dramatic, but a win is a win,"" Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said. ""I think it's the best way for us to understand how we need to close out game, what mistakes cause us to be in a hole where we have to fight back so hard. For the most part, as long as we get the win, that's all that matters."" San Antonio (9-14) has won three of four after losing 12 of 14. Buddy Hield had 23 points and Harrison Barnes added 19 for Sacramento, which has lost three straight. It was the Spurs' second straight overtime game. San Antonio beat Houston 135-133 in two overtimes on Tuesday. ""This is two really hard-fought wins,"" Spurs forward Rudy Gay said. ""We dug ourselves out of holes, we got it together. These are games we were losing a couple of games ago. We're just figuring a way to get these wins now."" Dejounte Murray's 16-foot jumper with 29 seconds was the go-ahead shot. Sacramento had taken a one-point lead 19 seconds earlier on Hield's 16-footer. Murray finished with 14 points, DeRozan had 15 and Patty Mills and Jakob Poeltl had 13 points apiece. Aldridge was 8 for 18 from the field in his return from a two-game absence due to a sore right thigh. He had 10 points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs rallied to win their third straight at home. The Spurs forced overtime by outscoring the Kings 11-2 in the final 1:50 of the fourth quarter. After Barnes hit a pair of free throws with 14.3 seconds left, Marco Belinelli drained a leaning 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds remaining to tie it at 100. ""I didn't lock in and pay extra attention on Belinelli,"" Hield said. ""It's on me."" DeRozan drove the lane and kicked the ball out to Belinelli, who came off a screen from Aldridge to break free from Hield. ""They executed the play really well and (Belinelli) came off wide open and he knocked it down,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He loves those situations. He always has for his whole career, so we went to him and he came through."" The teams combined for 32 turnovers and each squandered a double-digit lead in a sloppy game between teams that are each five games below .500. The Kings scored nine straight points after the Spurs tied the game at 89 with 3:44 remaining on DeRozan's third 3-pointer. Cory Joseph capped the run with a 3-pointer with 1:50 remaining. Mills had consecutive steals against Joseph that cut the Kings' lead to 98-95 with 1:13 left. ""It was a tough one for us because we felt like we had it,"" Joseph said. ""We made, including myself, a couple of bonehead mistakes at the end."" After holding Sacramento to a season low for points by an opponent in any half in building a 52-42 lead, San Antonio set a season low with 17 in the third quarter to give away the lead. TIP-INS Kings: Joseph, who played for the Spurs from 2011-15, made his 12th start at point guard for Sacramento. Joseph had seven points and an assist in 38 minutes. . Guard Bogdan Bogdanovic, who was questionable with a bruised right knee, had nine points in 21 minutes. Spurs: DeRozan had three 3-pointers in a game for the first time since April 4, 2018, when he was with Toronto. His career high is six with the Raptors. . Poeltl had three blocks, extending his streak to nine straight games with a block. It's second only to his streak of 13 straight games with a block in 2018. TIME OFF After playing 19 games since Nov. 1, Popovich was grateful the Spurs have five days off before playing again. ""We are going to give them another couple of days off like we did before this game,"" Popovich said. ""Because those 34 days, playing every other day, was really tough on them. This is a good break so we can practice on Monday and Tuesday and get some good work in and go from there.""","401160970"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  While Anthony Davis may have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, it certainly didn't show against Portland. Davis scored 39 points and the Los Angeles Lakers routed the Blazers 136-113 on Friday night. You see what he did on this road trip being sick? And hes starting to feel a lot better and I dont quite like it. I might sneeze on him a couple of times,"" said teammate LeBron James, who added 31 points. It was the 11th straight road win for the Lakers, who have lost just three games overall this season and sit atop the Western Conference standings. The game was costly for Portland. Starting forward Rodney Hood was injured in the first quarter and the team later announced that he had torn his left Achilles tendon. You've just got to keep going forward. We've got a season to play, and as disappointing as it is to lose players to injuries, we have a team, and we've got to keep competing and playing. You don't have any other choice,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Stotts was ejected late in the third quarter after angrily protesting a foul call that earned him a double technical. It was the first time that Stotts has been tossed from a game as an NBA coach. Damian Lillard, who helped pull Stotts back from the confrontation with referee Leon Wood, finished with 29 points. Portland trailed by as many as 27 in the fourth quarter. It was the first meeting of the season between friends James and Carmelo Anthony. The two shared a quick hug on the court just before tipoff. Anthony scored 15 points after the Trail Blazers guaranteed the 10-time All-Star's contract for the the rest of the season earlier Friday. Portland (9-14) got off to a slow start this season but had won four of its last five games, including Wednesday night's 127-116 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (20-3) were coming off a 121-96 rout of the Jazz in Salt Lake City on Wednesday. Davis had 26 points in that one. We have our mind set on something special. In order to reach that goal we have to stay in the moment and go game by game, Davis said. We take every game personal. We want to go out there and be the best team."" Anthony followed up a layup and a free throw with a 3-pointer to pull the Blazers ahead 18-17 midway through the first quarter. The Lakers led 39-34 after the period, led by Davis with 15 points. Rajon Rondo hit back-to-back 3 pointers to kick off a 15-0 run. Davis had 25 points at the half and the Lakers led 77-62. A pair of free throws from CJ McCollum pulled Portland within 13 points in the third quarter, but the Blazers were never able to close to within single digits. Davis' dunk extended the lead to 101-81. Lillard got the team together before the start of the fourth quarter. I just told them we're up against it. We're playing against a good team, we haven't had a great night, we're not getting anything, you know no calls for us, nothing is going in our favor, not getting the benefit of the doubt in those situations,"" Lillard said. So we're just going to have to get more aggressive. We're getting called for every touch anyway, so we might as well get physical, get aggressive and live with whatever happens, give ourselves a chance. It was the first of three meetings between the teams this season. TIP-INS Lakers: Rondo did not return to the game after halftime because of hamstring soreness. ... Los Angeles became the second NBA team to reach 20 wins this season, joining Milwaukee. ... James also had seven rebounds and eight assists before heading to the bench late in the final quarter. ... The team's 136 points were a season high. Trail Blazers: Hood left the game late in the first quarter after injuring his left leg. He was helped off the court and did not return. ... The Lakers' 77 first-half points were the most the Blazers had allowed in the half this season. ... Hassan Whiteside had 17 points and 10 rebounds for his 13th double-double of the season. FEELING MELO James was asked after the game about how he felt playing against his old friend. I cant even lie, its always special to be on the floor with a brother of mine. We got so much history, you know weve competed against each other since 2001 when it all started. In Colorado Springs, at the Junior Olympics. ... Its always great to compete. Its great to be on the same floor period. No matter if we are teammates or competing on our respective clubs, James said. DISAPPOINTMENT The Blazers locker room was somber after the game, not so much because of the loss, but because of the loss of Hood. Portland has been hit by difficult injuries this season. The team also lost forward Zach Collins to a shoulder injury. ""You hate to see one of your teammates go down to an injury like that, especially a starter, and somebody who is really a good person and having a great season, fitting in really well with our team, and a big part of what we do. You just feel for him personally more than anything,"" Lillard said.","401160971"
"DALLAS -- With Kristaps Porzingis joining Luka Doncic in the Dallas lineup this season, the Mavericks expected to be better. But Boban Marjanovic? Doncic scored 28 points in 26 minutes, Porzingis had 13 points and the 1,500th rebound of his career and Marjanovic had season highs of 15 points and 16 rebounds to help Dallas rout the New Orleans Pelicans 130-84 on Saturday. Doncic also had nine assists and six rebounds. Dallas led 64-52 at halftime. Doncic already had 20 points, and Marjanovic scored 11 points, nine in the second quarter. ""[Marjanovic] did a great job,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The group in the second quarter really did a good job of giving us a 10-point lead. He was a big part of it, getting it to him with a smaller guy on him. He was doing a lot of damage."" The Pelicans didn't get within 10 points in the second half. ""The rest of the game was just a formality,"" Porzingis said. Last season, Doncic was the NBA's rookie of the year and Porzingis was injured and didn't play after being acquired in a trade with the New York Knicks. Marjanovic, a 7-foot-4 Serbian, played for two teams before taking a 50% pay cut to sign with Dallas as a free agent. He was a force against the undersized Pelicans. ""When they elected to use [Jahlil] Okafor, that was an opportunity for us to use Boban,"" Carlisle said. ""It's hard to use him against guys like [Jaxson] Hayes because of the quickness and shooting."" Porzingis and his teammates were happy for Marjanovic. ""Can't stop Bobie,"" Porzingis said. ""He played great on the boards. He's so big, so strong. Once he gets the ball in the paint, they can't do much out there."" Marjanovic energized the crowd and his teammates. ""When you hear [the crowd] cheering for you, basically you warm up your body so fast. Blood keep going through the body, and you're not too tight anymore."" The 46-point margin was two shy of Dallas' season high against Golden State. Dallas has won five in a row to improve to 18-8. The Mavericks have won 10 of 11 for the first time since winning their only NBA championship in 2010-11. New Orleans has lost eight in a row. ""A poorly played game, a poorly coached game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Doncic, Porzingis and the other starters didn't play in the fourth quarter after the Mavericks ran up a 38-point lead at 104-66. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 14 points. Off the bench, Jalen Brunson scored 14 on 6-for-6 shooting and Seth Curry had 11. J.J. Redick led New Orleans with 15 points. Brandon Ingram and Jrue Holiday scored 14 each and Hayes had 11. TIP-INS Pelicans: Redick had a 4-point play 3:27 into the game. Only Jamal Crawford and James Harden have more career 4-point plays in NBA history than Redick. ... F/C Derrick Favors, who is on a personal leave, missed his 11th straight game. Mavericks: G Delon Wright didn't play after the first quarter because of a right adductor strain. ""Very unlikely he's playing [Sunday],"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ... C Dwight Powell was in the starting lineup after leaving Wednesday's game with an injury to his left wrist. ... Dallas scored a season-high 104 points in the first three quarters. ... The Mavericks' 40 points were the most in the third quarter this season. ... They are 10 games over .500 for the first time since 2014-15. 20, 5 AND 5 OR MORE When Mavericks G Luka Doncic grabbed a defensive rebound 23 seconds into the third quarter, it marked his 18th straight game with at least 20 points, five assists and five rebounds in a game. The only player to have done that since the NBA/NBA merger in 1976 was Hall of Famer Michael Jordan in 1976-77. Oscar Robertson had a 29-game streak before the merger.","401160972"
"RJ Barrett reacts to the first coaching move in his NBA career, saying David Fizdale's firing has opened his eyes to play harder. (1:13) NEW YORK -- The New York Knicks didn't have any close games in David Fizdale's final days, then got one right away under interim coach Mike Miller. Julius Randle's missed free throw ended their chance to win it, but just being competitive again was a good start after a rough couple of days. ""You get in those games, you've got to make another play and we just didn't make another play,"" Miller said. ""Loved the effort. That was fun."" Randle missed a free throw with 0.1 seconds left, sending New York to a 104-103 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night in the Knicks' first game since firing Fizdale. The Knicks were much more competitive under Miller than they had been in recent games under Fizdale, who was fired Friday. They chased after rebounds and loose balls throughout the fourth quarter, erasing an 11-point deficit and giving themselves a shot at overtime when Randle was fouled while trying to put back the rebound off a scramble. He calmly made the first free throw but the second was well long, sending New York to its ninth straight loss and a 4-19 record. ""It was tough. Very difficult, but we played really hard,"" Randle said. ""We gave everything that we had. Came up short, but keep doing that and we're going to win a lot of games."" T.J. Warren scored 25 points and Domantas Sabonis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Pacers. They bounced back from a loss at Detroit on Friday. ""We knew it was going to be a tough game, whether with the coach or without the coach,"" Sabonis said. ""They are a dangerous team because they play with a lot of energy and the crowd is into it."" The Knicks lost by 44 to Milwaukee and by 37 to Denver in their past two games under Fizdale and he was fired Friday after running practice. The Knicks offered no details about the decision in their news release announcing the firing, and team executives didn't speak Saturday. Players had held a team meeting Friday to discuss their outlook going forward, even before learning it would be without Fizdale. They responded with a good effort in the first game since the change but couldn't overcome their 40.6% shooting. Marcus Morris Sr. scored 25 points for the Knicks and Randle finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds. The Knicks led by two with about 4 minutes left in the third before Indiana outscored them 13-3 to end the period. Warren had a three-point play to start it and Doug McDermott had the final five points of the quarter with a 3-pointer and long 2 to make it 89-81. He made another 3 to open the fourth to make it 92-81. ""When I get to my spots I can be aggressive and productive, kind of make plays just scoring the ball and being myself,"" Warren said. ""My teammates did a great job of finding me early and getting me going."" TIP-INS Pacers: Sabonis, who had a 12-for-12 shooting game here last season, made his first five and finished 8 for 11. ... Malcolm Brogdon sat out because of an injured right hand. Knicks: Keith Bogans was added to the staff as an assistant coach after previously serving as an assistant for Westchester in the G League. The Knicks also fired assistant Keith Smart on Friday. ... G Wayne Ellington missed the game because of a sore left Achilles tendon. BACKING FIZDALE Knicks players who spoke before the game said they had good relationships with Fizdale and had spoken about the need to step up and take pressure off him. They said management discussed with them the reason for the change, but none of the players shared it. ""Fiz is one of the types of guys that will be around the league for a long time,"" Morris said. ""It didn't work out here, so be it, but we've got to keep going forward, we've got to keep getting better.""","401160973"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Ben Simmons hit another 3-pointer, and his coach wants him to keep on firing. Simmons hit his second career 3 and scored a career-high 34 points, and the Philadelphia 76ers didn't need Joel Embiid's help to rout the Cleveland Cavaliers 141-94 Saturday night. Simmons made 12 of 14 field goals, including his only 3-point attempt, and hit 9 of 12 free throws in 26 minutes to help Philadelphia improve to 11-0 at home. ""I was locked in,"" Simmons said. Simmons' jump shot -- or lack thereof -- has been a hot topic in Philadelphia. He entered the season 0 for 17 from long range. Coach Brett Brown has repeatedly said shooting is a part of Simmons' game that will develop with time. After Saturday's performance, Brown publicly upped the ante and called for more from his All-Star point guard. ""This is what I want,"" Brown said. ""I want a 3-point shot per game, minimum. ... He will be liberated. His world will open up and, in many ways, so will ours."" Embiid sat out with a left hip contusion. Darius Garland had 17 points for the Cavaliers, who have lost six in a row and 12 of 13. ""They were going downhill on us all day long,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. Philadelphia has been projected to be an NBA title contender, but the 76ers haven't been able to consistently field its starting five of Simmons, Embiid, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris and Al Horford. They have only started nine games together due to injuries and Embiid's two-game suspension for fighting Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns. The 76ers needed little more than Simmons in a dominant first half that ended with them ahead 77-36. Simmons attacked the basket often and showed off a rarely seen mid-range game when he drained an 11-foot jumper with 6:04 left in the second quarter. That had 76ers fans cheering, but it was just an appetizer for Simmons. With 3:41 left in the half, Simmons took a cross-court pass from Trey Burke and knocked down a 3 from the left wing. That send the sold-out crowd into a frenzy, and the roars continued when Simmons finished an alley-oop dunk from Burke on Philadelphia's ensuing possession. Simmons received a standing ovation at the next stoppage. ""I'm getting more comfortable learning my spots and just adjusting,"" Simmons said. ""I'm trying not to force it, trying to play the game I know how to play. Hard work pays off. Stay in the gym and keep working."" Simmons finished the tremendous four-possession sequence with assists on Philadelphia's next two trips, first to Horford for a 3-pointer and then to James Ennis III for a jumper. Finally, Simmons ended the first half scoring with a 9-foot jumper for a 41-point lead entering the break. WINNING BIG The 47-point margin of victory is tied for third-most in Philadelphia history. The club's greatest victory is a 62-point rout of the Knicks on Dec. 25, 1960 prior to the move to Philadelphia when they were the Syracuse Nationals. BACKING BEILEIN Brown knows what Beilein is going through trying to resurrect the Cavaliers, having accumulated just 47 combined wins himself over his first three seasons during Philadelphia's rebuilding process. The 76ers coach said prior to the contest that he believes Beilein is wired to be successful in the NBA after compiling 829 victories in 40 years of coaching at the college level. The coaches embraced after the game with Brown offering some words of encouragement. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland set a season low for points in a half, worse than the 40 the Cavaliers scored against Orlando on Dec. 6. ... Cleveland's previous largest margin of defeat this season was 42 points, 143-101 at Dallas on Nov. 22. 76ers: Richardson (right hamstring tightness) missed his fifth straight contest.

"HOUSTON --  On a night where James Harden's shots weren't falling for three quarters, the Houston Rockets got big performances from those in supporting roles until the star stepped up late to close out the victory. Harden scored 18 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter and Ben McLemore added 27 points to help the Rockets outlast the Phoenix Suns 115-109 on Saturday night. Harden had a tough shooting night through three quarters and was 5 of 19 overall and 1 of 10 on 3s with 16 points before getting going in the fourth. The game was tied with about 7 minutes left, and he scored all of Houston's points in a 13-6 run that made it 102-95. That's how deep we are, Harden said. We have a really good team and guys that can make plays and knock down shots. More importantly we were focused on our defense. Russell Westbrook had 24 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his third straight triple-double and sixth this season. Harden finished 8 of 27, 3 of 17 on 3s and made 15 of 18 free throws. Devin Booker led the Suns with 35 points after scoring a season-high 44 in an overtime victory at New Orleans on Thursday night. Phoenix coach Monty Williams was proud of his team for staying in it until the very end. We have a mentality that we just don't give in, Williams said. We're playing young guys that are learning how to play against physical NBA men and that's part of developing. The Suns cut the lead to five twice in the last 90 seconds, but both times Westbrook made a layup to extend the advantage. And the second time he was fouled on the shot and made the free throw to make it 114-106. The Suns scored seven straight points, capped by a dunk from Kelly Oubre, to tie it at 85 with about 9 minutes left. After a timeout, Harden scored Houston's first points in about three minutes on a layup to put Houston back on top. It was tied again before Harden scored five points to give the Rockets a 94-89 lead. He stole the ball from Ty Jerome after that and was fouled by Booker on a drive, with Harden aggressively continuing forward and pushing Booker off the court. Harden later shoved Booker, and they both received technical fouls to the bewilderment of the Suns. Harden made both free throws to make it seven points in a row and was fouled again after he stole the ball from Mikal Bridges. Harden made one of those free throws to make it 97-89. He finds a way to win the game, Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. A lot of guys contributed. A lot of guys played well. TIP-INS Suns: Oubre had 19 points. ... Dario Saric added 13 points and 12 rebounds. ... Bridges had 14 points. ... The Suns made 11 of 35 3s. Rockets: C Tyson Chandler missed the game with flu-like symptoms. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Defense is a work in progress for Utah, and the Jazz are starting to put more pieces of the puzzle together. Utah used a strong defensive performance in the second quarter to power its way to a 126-112 victory over Memphis on Saturday night. The Jazz smothered the Grizzlies during the quarter, forcing turnovers and contesting shots with a vigor not previously seen during a road trip in which they dropped four of five games, or during a lopsided loss at home to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. Through the first 10 1/2 minutes of the second quarter Saturday night, Utah gave up just 10 points. The Jazz forced seven turnovers and scored 14 points off the miscues. It set the Grizzlies on their heels, and Memphis never really recovered. ""We got stops,"" center Rudy Gobert said. ""We raised our level defensively and we stopped turning the ball over offensively. All of a sudden, we were able to score, to get stops, to run on them. The ball was moving."" Donovan Mitchell led a balanced offensive attack with 22 points. Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Jeff Green scored 19 points apiece. Green matched his season-high. Utah shot a season-best 57% from the field and went 19 of 34 from 3-point range. Excellent ball movement produced high percentage shots through all four quarters. The Jazz had 32 assists on 45 baskets. Joe Ingles led the way with a season-high 10 assists to go along with his 10 points. Gobert (five) and Emmanuel Mudiay (seven) also finished with season highs in assists. ""We moved the ball,"" Mitchell said. ""We were all on the same page, for the most part, trying to get each other involved. That's just how we have to continue to play."" Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 26 points and Jae Crowder added 13 for the Grizzlies. Memphis lost despite forcing 22 turnovers and shooting 53% from the field. ""They came out firing on all cylinders,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""They hit 19 3s. That's hard to overcome."" The Jazz shot 60.5% and went 11 of 19 from 3-point range in the first half alone. Memphis kept pace with the Jazz in the first quarter. The Grizzlies went on a 15-5 run to take a 35-28 lead near the end of the quarter. Crowder sparked the run with back-to-back 3-pointers, drawing a foul and converting a free throw on the second. Memphis took advantage of six Jazz turnovers in the first quarter, converting them into 13 points. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, committed only two turnovers. ""They came out really physical early,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""I think as the game progressed, our level of determination to cut and move alleviated some of that."" That all changed in the second quarter when the Jazz clamped down on defense to break the game open before halftime. It opened the door for Utah to make a 20-4 run and take a 60-42 lead. Mitchell bookended the run with a layup and a 3-pointer. Green fueled the bulk of outburst with a pair of 3-pointers and a running alley-oop dunk over a two-minute stretch. ""We just missed shots, man,"" Jackson said. ""They shot really well today, it was just a couple we needed here and there. Probably taking smarter shots, maybe we used too much of the clock at times. We just missed."" Memphis cut the deficit to single digits midway through the third quarter. The Grizzlies closed within 82-75 on back-to-back baskets from Solomon Hill and Grayson Allen. Memphis never got closer than seven points. Ingles and Bogdanovic hit back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a 15-4 run. Green capped it off with another outside basket, putting the Jazz up 97-79. DISHING IT OUT Ingles made a splash in his second straight start. He became the first Jazz player to record 10 or more assists this season. Three of his assists came in the first quarter while the Jazz were trying to keep pace with the Grizzlies' hot shooting. Four came in the third quarter when Memphis attempted to rally from a double-digit deficit. ""He's starting to fall into a comfort level and I know (he showed) his ability to make plays and find people on the perimeter or finish,"" Snyder said. ""He had a great decision-making game."" WARM WELCOME Crowder received a nice ovation from the crowd during pregame introductions. He also shared a hug with Snyder in front of the Jazz bench just before tipoff. The veteran forward appeared in 107 games with Utah, making 11 starts, before a trade in July sent him, Allen, Kyle Korver, and a 2020 first-round draft pick to Memphis in exchange for Mike Conley. He averaged 11.9 points and 4.5 rebounds during his stint with the Jazz. ""Feels good to be back,"" Crowder said. ""Me and the crowd have a good relationship and left on a good note, so it felt good to get an ovation when I came back here."" TIP INS Grizzlies: Ja Morant missed his fourth straight game because of back soreness. . Crowder got a nice ovation from the crowd during pregame introductions. He played with the Jazz from 2017-19. ... Allen finished with 13 points in his first game back in Utah. He spent his rookie season with the Jazz, appearing in 38 games. ...

"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie saved the Brooklyn Nets -- again. Dinwiddie scored 24 points and the Nets held off the Denver Nuggets 105-102 on Sunday for their third straight victory. ""As long as it's working, you're all going to love me,"" Dinwiddie said. ""As soon as I miss, you're all going to hate me and tell me I'm selfish or something. We're going to keep rolling with it until that moment and I'll deal with whatever I've got to say then."" Denver had a chance to force overtime, but Jamal Murray missed a 3-pointer from the wing as time expired. Jarrett Allen added 19 points and 11 rebounds for Brooklyn. Star guard Kyrie Irving missed his 12th straight game because of a right shoulder impingement. Nikola Jokic had 24 points and 11 rebounds for Denver, and Murray scored 21 points. The Nuggets have lost two straight. Dinwiddie made consecutive driving layups to give Brooklyn a 103-102 lead with 26.3 seconds remaining. Denver's Will Barton missed a 16-foot off-balance floater, and Taurean Prince grabbed the rebound and was fouled. Prince made both free throws to make it 105-102 with 6.8 seconds left. ""It's like having an elite running back if you're an NFl coach,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said about Dinwiddie. ""You can just pitch it to him and he can go get a bucket. ... When he gets speed downhill he's basically unstoppable. Those were the two plays where he got a head of steam and you can't stop him."" Dinwiddie has scored 20 or more points in 10 of his last 12 games. For Jokic, Brooklyn's ability to get to the rim at will in crunch time was unacceptable. ""It was too easy for them,"" Jokic said. ""Second half it was too easy for them. We got to do something. I don't know what it is, but (we) probably need to do something."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Coach Michael Malone praised Paul Millsap. ""He's been the quiet unsung hero of our team,"" Malone said. ""We've had a lot of younger guys who have been up and down, inconsistent. If you looked at our first 20 games, Paul has been Mr. consistency for us, and that's what you expect from a 14-year veteran."" Millsap had nine points and four rebounds in 21 minutes.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Trae Young took a knee to the face, then returned to deliver a knockout blow to the Hornets. Young turned in perhaps his most complete game of the season with 30 points, nine assists and six rebounds and the Atlanta Hawks beat Charlotte 122-107 on Sunday night for their second victory in three games after a 10-game losing streak. ""I thought I was going to be out forever,"" a fat-lipped Young said about the blow. ""But I just cut my lip though. It felt worse than it looks."" Jabari Parker added 19 points and Vince Carter had 17 off the bench on 7-of-9 shooting to help the Hawks improve to 6-17. Center Alex Len finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds and played a big role in helping turn the tide of the game in the third quarter. But it was Young who provided the daggers. He had 20 points in the second half, including 14 in the decisive fourth quarter in which the Hawks blew open a game in which they trailed at halftime. This was Young's 10th 30-point game of the season, but only the second time the Hawks have won when he's reached that scoring plateau. ""I love it, whenever we win that's all that matters to me,"" Young said. ""If I play good and we win, I feel great. Play good and we lose, I'm mad."" ""I thought that was his best game of the year,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""He had leadership on both side of the floor. He was engaged. He was yelling out their plays and barking to us. When you're locked in on both side of the ball and leading your team, I just thought it was his best game as a floor general."" The 7-foot Len scored 11 points in the third quarter after being shut out in the first half. He played aggressive, scoring on a 3 from the top of the key, a pick-and-roll dunk from Carter and was strong on the offensive glass, helping give the Hawks a five-point lead entering the fourth quarter. From there, Young took over as the Hawks broke open the game with a 19-8 run to start the fourth quarter. Young was 5 of 7 from the field in the final quarter with two 3-pointers. Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington each had 20 points to lead the Hornets. Charlotte has lost three of four during a five-game homestand. Washington left the game midway through the fourth quarter after rolling his right ankle on a drive. Its unclear if he will miss any time. ""I just thought we were going through the motions in the second half,"" Washington said. ""It felt like we could have put them away, but we just let them hang around, they got on a run and started making shots and they just put us away."" TIP INS Hawks: DeAndre Hunter returned after missing a game because of a dislocated right index finger. He had 10 points and five assists. ... Atlanta's backups outscored Charlotte's 57-36.

Scoring leader Devonte Graham had a rough night shooting, finishing with 12 points on 4-of-17 shooting. He had eight assists. CARTER STILL HAS IT The 42-year-old Carter still has what it takes to bring the crowd to its feet. Returning to North Carolina, where he played college ball, Carter always gets a little more amped. He made one move to the basket and finished with his left hand, drawing ""ooohs"" from the crowd. ""I mean the stuff he did today was unbelievable,"" Len said. ""He had steals, was making moves, spin and step back making 3s. It was just great to see. When he was playing that way we all just picked it up and played with it like it was contagious."" KIDD-GILCHRIST RETURNS Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has spent the majority of the season on the bench, but did see his most extensive action against the Hawks and scored seven points in nearly 23 minutes. ""I was giving MKG a look,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said of the former No. 2 pick in the NBA draft. ""He's the one guy that has stayed ready. He's working and I went with him tonight instead of Nic (Batum). That's where we're at."" Batum, the team's highest-paid player at more than $20 million per season, did not play at all.","401160978"
"MIAMI --  Game on the line, perfect home record on the line, and the Miami Heat turned to their teenager. Tyler Herro came through. The rookie guard scored 27 points -- including 16 of Miami's final 18 -- and the Heat held off the Chicago Bulls 110-105 on Sunday night. They improved to 10-0 at home this season, extending the best home start in franchise history. ""I don't shy away from taking the big shot,"" Herro said. That's obvious. The 19-year-old made three 3-pointers in overtime, plus another with 7.1 seconds left in regulation just to help Miami get into the extra session. Of his five field goals in the final 6 minutes, four of them were assisted by Jimmy Butler. ""If your max player trusts you at that point in the game -- and Jimmy was looking for him -- that says all you need to know,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That trust has been earned within our walls. Jimmy has seen what this kid does in those situations."" Butler scored 23 points for the Heat, going 17 for 21 from the foul line. Bam Adebayo had 21 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for Miami, which also got 18 from Kendrick Nunn. Lauri Markkanen had 13 of his team-high 22 points in the third quarter for the Bulls, who got 18 from Zach LaVine and 16 from Kris Dunn. Markkanen missed a potentially game-tying corner 3-pointer with about 1.5 seconds left in overtime, Coby White fouled Herro on the rebound, and Miami's first-round draft pick made a pair of free throws to seal the win. ""I liked the way we fought,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""I liked the way we competed. I thought we played our (butt) off."" The Bulls fell to 1-4 in games decided by five points or less. It was tied at 97-97 after regulation, after the lead changed hands four times in the final 84 seconds. Herro's 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left put Miami up 97-95, but Butler fouled LaVine on the ensuing Chicago possession. LaVine -- an 81% foul shooter -- made both, Butler's 50-footer as the horn sounded merely hit the backboard, and off to overtime they went. From there, Herro took over. He had 11 of Miami's 13 OT points; the other two were from Nunn, another rookie. ""Definitely frustrated to lose. But we played well,"" Dunn said. ""A lot of guys played well. I thought we did the right things to put us in position to win the game. We just didn't come up with the victory."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago led by as many as 11 and held Miami without a field goal for the first 5:55 of the fourth quarter. ... Thaddeus Young, who missed Friday's loss to Golden State for personal reasons, was back with the Bulls and played off their bench. ... Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder sprain) missed his fifth consecutive game, but is improving. ""Every day his shoulder gets less sore, more loose,"" Boylen said. Heat: Butler played 44 minutes, shooting 3 for 14. ... Miami is 3-0 in overtime this season. ... Goran Dragic (groin), Dion Waiters (illness) and Justise Winslow (back) were unavailable. Waiters has not played this season and Winslow has missed 13 of Miami's 23 games. ... Adebayo -- who's been listening to pleas from Butler to shoot more 3's -- missed one in the second quarter. He's now 1 for 7 from deep this season. FOR STARTERS Miami has played 23 times this season and has yet to be beaten in consecutive games. That's a first in franchise history. QUICK WORK Bulls backup Daniel Gafford committed three fouls in an 83-second span of the first quarter, earning him a quick trip back to the bench. He checked in with 3:53 left, committed his first with 3:35 left, his second with 3:10 left and the third with 2:12 remaining.","401160979"
"PHILADELPHIA --  This victory over the Toronto Raptors didnt feel as good as it should have to the Philadelphia 76ers because of their shaky finish. Tobias Harris scored 26 points and rookie Matisse Thybulle had a career-high 20 points, including a pair of free throws with 23 seconds left, to lead Philadelphia 76ers to their 12th straight home victory, 110-104 over the Raptors on Sunday night. Ben Simmons had 16 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists a day after scoring a career-high 34 points while hitting his second career 3-pointer as the Sixers remained unbeaten at home this season. Philadelphia led by 20 points with 6 minutes left and seemed on the way to an easy victory before seven turnovers down the stretch, including turnovers by Joel Embiid on three consecutive possessions, had coach Brett Brown feeling lukewarm about the win. Where do we begin? Brown responded when asked about the finish. The way it ended left a little bit of a sour taste. Thybulle finally iced the game with a pair of free throws with 26.3 seconds left that made it 107-100. Kyle Lowry, playing in his second game after missing 11 in a row due to a broken left thumb, scored 26 points, and OG Anunoby had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. The defending champion Raptors have lost three in a row. Our rhythm wasnt great and we didnt shoot it great, Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. Embiid returned from a one-game absence due to a hip injury, finishing with 10 points and eight rebounds. Embiid was benched with 2:08 remaining after committing the three turnovers but did return to the floor. He had seven of Philadelphias 17 turnovers. He had some rough decisions, but hes one of the main reasons we won, Brown said. Something we will learn and grow from. Toronto got close late, but the Raptors had dug too big of a hole in the third quarter. Philadelphia held Toronto to 36% shooting in the first half while taking a 57-42 lead at the break. The 76ers continued to clamp down on the Raptors offense after halftime and got a big lift from the bench during a decisive third-quarter run that saw their lead grow to as many as 20 points, 73-53, on Al Horfords hook with 4:23 remaining in the period. It was 63-53 Philadelphia when Lowry made the first of two free throws with 5:51 left. Then, Thybulle sandwiched a pair of 3-pointers around a James Ennis III layup before Horfords shot that capped a 10-0 run over 1:28. Simmons put the exclamation point on the quarter with a driving, one-handed slam over Gasol. STREAKING SIXERS Philadelphia is nine games shy of tying the club record for home wins to start a season. The franchise has won 21 straight home games to start a campaign three times, twice in Syracuse (1949-50 and 1952-53 seasons) and once after moving to Philadelphia (1966-67). IMPROVED EMBIID It wasnt Embiids best performance, but it was much better than the last time the teams met. Embiid had the worst game of his career in a 101-96 loss at Toronto on Nov. 25. He was scoreless in 32 minutes, went 0 for 11 from the field, including 0 for 4 from 3-point range, and missed all three free-throw attempts. In the five games that followed and entering Sunday, Embiid averaged 26.8 points and 15.2 rebounds while going to the free-throw line 64 times, making 56. TIP-INS Raptors: Fred VanVleet (right knee contusion) was injured in the first half and didnt return. He had two points in 12 minutes and missed his only 3-point attempt, ending his streak of at least one 3 in every game this season. Now, only Houstons James Harden and Brooklyns Taurean Prince have a 3 in every game this season.  Terrence Davis II was issued a Flagrant 1 foul with 34.4 seconds left in the first quarter while contesting Mike Scotts 3-pointer. 76ers: Josh Richardson (right hamstring strain) missed his sixth straight game.  The teams will meet twice more, Jan. 22 at Toronto, and March 18 in Philadelphia.  Philadelphia Flyers goalie Carter Hart rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell prior to the game and sat courtside with teammate Scott Laughton.","401160980"
"WASHINGTON --  The Los Angeles Clippers are making progress. The Washington Wizards want the refs to make more calls. Kawhi Leonard had 34 points and 11 rebounds as the Clippers bounced back from their worst loss of the season by pulling away for a 135-119 win over the Wizards on Sunday night. Paul George scored 27 points and Montrezl Harrell had nine of his 20 in the fourth quarter for Los Angeles, which improved to 4-6 away from home two games into their six-game trip. The victory came two days after Los Angeles, now second in the Western Conference, opened the trip with a 119-91 loss at East-leading Milwaukee. ""I think the key to it is just getting more games, more times on the court,"" said George, one of several Clippers who battled early season injuries while searching for team chemistry. ""That's really the only way we're going to learn to trust, learn to play with confidence with one another, and learn to play together."" After seeing Leonard and George held to just 30 points combined against the Bucks, this time the Clippers frustrated one of the NBA's elite scorers, holding Bradley Beal to 20 points on 5-for-18 shooting. Nine of Beal's points came from the foul line, and the Wizards' 30 foul shots were three more than the Clippers had. But Beal believed he and his teammates got the short end. ""It's completely unfair and unacceptable,"" Beal said, ""that they allow a lot of stuff to go on with me out there and not get calls. Period."" Washington's bench kept the game competitive for more than three quarters. Davis Bertans tied his season-high with 25 points, including six 3-pointers. Troy Brown Jr. scored a career-high 20 points. The Wizards earned three of the games' five technical fouls, with Bertans even picking one up from the bench and Ish Smith picking up his during the fourth quarter. ""When Ish gets a tech, I know something's going on,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who received the other Wizards technical. ""That guy's is the nicest guy on the planet. He gets a technical by just telling a referee to call it the same on the other end. But we've got to play through it."" Los Angeles closed the game with a 22-10 run, including a stretch when Leonard and Harrell combined to score 17 consecutive points. Leonard turned his 10th defensive rebound into a transition dunk and unconventional four-point play after absorbing a personal foul and Smith's technical to make it 121-109. Later, he added a reverse layup and a pull-up jumper to stretch the lead to 125-112. Harrell followed with a thunderous baseline dunk and three-point play, and then another layup to make it 130-114. ""We found mismatches and just kind of put the game away,"" George said. TIP-INS Clippers: Maurice Harkless picked up a technical foul with 4:39 left in the first quarter, and Beverley picked up another 45 seconds later. . After leaving Friday's loss at Milwaukee early, F Patrick Patterson sat out with back spasms ... F JaMychal Green returned (tailbone) after a one-game absence. Wizards: Beal's first field goal came with 2:26 left in the first half, an acrobatic runner off the glass that tied it at 58-all. He finished the half with 11 points. . Smith's technical foul was one of three. Coach Scott Brooks picked up a technical with 4:39 left in the opening quarter, and Bertans got one while on the bench 39 seconds before halftime. COACH-ISMS ""I think our chemistry is really good, but I don't think we're playing well yet as a group -- that's two different things. Usually those things go hand-in-hand. They don't this year because we're around each other a lot, we just don't play with each other a lot. It's really the strangest thing I've ever seen."" -- Clippers coach Doc Rivers on his team's offensive flow at this point in the season. ""You can look at, yeah it is back to back to back, but it's really not back to back to back. Right? I'm not trying to have you agree with me, but I am."" -- Brooks on F Admiral Schofield playing three straight days between the NBA and G League. SIX FOR THE SIXTH MAN Bertans has now hit at least six 3s in five appearances this season, his first in Washington. He accomplished the feat only twice in his first three seasons in San Antonio.","401160981"
"Luka Doncic explains what he has to do better with his behavior around the referees after Dallas' loss at home to Sacramento. (0:55) DALLAS --  Nemanja Bjelica could see another game slipping away from the Sacramento Kings with the ball in Luka Doncics hands. But Doncic missed a tying attempt in the final seconds as the Kings withstood a furious rally and beat the Mavericks 110-106 on Sunday night. With the memory of an overtime loss at San Antonio on Friday fresh in his mind, Bjelica matched his career best with 30 points. Richaun Holmes rebounded Doncics attempt to tie the game with eight seconds left. Doncic had taken Sacramentos Cory Joseph down the lane for the turnaround shot that clanged off the front of the rim. After the rebound, the Kings called a timeout. Bogdan Bogdanovic in-bounded to Bjelica for a layup that sealed the win. We all see how great Luka is, Holmes said, so you just try to do as much as you can to take him out his comfort zone. Sacramento ended a three-game losing streak. Dallas had won five straight and 10 of 11 before the loss. It feels good to win, Bjelica said. After we lost (Friday) against San Antonio, its a very important win for us. Buddy Hield scored 26 points, including five 3-pointers, for Sacramento. Former Maverick Harrison Barnes had 13, Holmes added 12 and a game-high nine rebounds. Bogdanovic and Trevor Ariza scored 10 each. (Bjelicas) got the skill, the passing ability and shooting ability to really put pressure on the defense, Kings coach Luke Walton said. Were constantly encouraging him to be more aggressive and tonight he was aggressive. The Mavericks high scorer was Tim Hardaway Jr. with 29 points. He kept the Mavs in the game by making a career-high nine of 12 3-pointers. Doncic finished with 27 points, including 17 in the second half after Sacramento had sprinted to a 66-46 lead. We were very disappointed at our defense in the first half, and the second half was certainly way better, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. But, gotta play the whole game. A disappointing loss. Hardaway said there was a message at halftime. Do you guys want to get smacked at home or do you want to get the crowd involved and give yourself a chance to win and keep this thing going? Everybody took it to heart and did just that, Hardaway said. For Dallas, Dorian Finney-Smith and Kristaps Porzingis each had 13 points. Sacramento didnt trail in the game and led by as many as 24 points. The lead was 106-90 with 6:34 remaining. A 10-0 run capped by a 3-pointer by Doncic pulled the Mavericks within six points. The Kings lead dwindled to two points on a fadeaway by Porzingis with 34 seconds left. Barnes missed a shot in the lane. Finney-Smith grabbed the rebound with 14 seconds left. After a timeout, Doncic got the ball. Hes in the paint with a small defender on him, Hardaway said. Ill take my chances with him all day long. TIP-INS Kings: PG Cory Joseph started despite experiencing pain in his lower back after playing 38 minutes on Friday night. ... F Marvin Bagley III remained out because of a fractured right thumb. He has not played since the Oct. 23 season opener. ... Kings not named Hield or Bjelica were 1 for 11 (9%) on 3-pointers in the first half.

"Chris Paul laughs off the situation of being called twice for delay of game in the Thunders' win over the Trail Blazers. (0:56) PORTLAND, Ore. -- It was less than two weeks ago that the Oklahoma City Thunder last visited Portland, but this time they wouldn't leave with a loss. Dennis Schroder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each scored 21 points and the Thunder opened a four-game trip with a 108-96 victory over the Trail Blazers on Sunday night. The Thunder, who led by as many as 18 points in the first half, have won four of their last five games, the team's best stretch of the season. Chris Paul finished with 20 points. ""Obviously, the last time we came here we were really beat handily, from start to finish. We did get it back to nine, but we never really were in control of the game, constantly fighting an uphill battle,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said, recalling the 136-119 loss n Nov. 26. ""It was good that we were able to come into a tough place and play and find a way to win the game."" Damian Lillard had 26 for the Blazers, who have lost three of four. After trailing 55-47 at the break, the Blazers closed the gap in the third quarter and the Thunder held just an 82-78 advantage going into the final period. But Danilo Gallinari's 3-pointer put Oklahoma City up 95-87 with 4:14 left. Gilgeous-Alexander hit a 3-pointer and a floater that extended Oklahoma City's margin to 100-89 with 3:13 left and essentially put the game out of reach for the Blazers. ""I think we kind of just play well in stretches, and we don't really have the luxury of playing well in stretches. We're a team that if the ball's not going in, we gotta be getting to the 50-50 balls, we can't be letting teams get second and third opportunities. We foul every 30 seconds,"" Lillard said. ""I mean we are are doing a lot of things as a team that are putting us at a disadvantage."" Portland (9-15) was coming off a costly 136-113 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Starting forward Rodney Hood tore his Achilles during the first half and will miss the rest of the season. The Blazers had already lost forward Zach Collins to a shoulder injury that required surgery. And center Jusuf Nurkic continues to rehab from a broken leg. Portland made a move to shore up the frontcourt with the Nov. 19 signing of 10-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony, who hadn't played for more than a year. Anthony has fit in well with the Blazers, averaging 16.7 points and 5.6 rebounds through his first nine games. But he struggled against the Thunder, going 4 of 18 from the field and finishing with just nine points. Kent Bazemore started in Hood's place against Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City (10-12) was without Terrance Ferguson because of right hip soreness for the second straight game. Coach Billy Donovan said before the game that he expects Ferguson will miss Monday night's game at the Jazz as well. Abdel Nader started in his place. The Thunder were coming off a 139-127 overtime victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Oklahoma City forced overtime when Steven Adams threw a length-of-the-court pass that Schroder caught and laid in at the buzzer. The game got attention because Thunder guard Chris Paul alerted the officials that Minnesota's Jordan Bell had an untucked shirt, which led to a technical foul that helped the trailing Thunder send the game to overtime. Neither team looked sharp at the start on Sunday. Oklahoma City held a slight 21-20 lead at the end of the first quarter, on 31.8% shooting. Portland shot 27.6% to open the game. Schroder's pull-up jumper stretched the Thunder's lead to 41-29 midway through the second quarter. Portland clawed back into it and closed to within 51-47 on Anthony's 3-pointer, which capped a 10-0 Blazers run. But Portland couldn't get closer and trailed 55-47 at the break. Paul led all players with 16 points. Portland closed within 62-60 on Lillard's 3-pointer in the third quarter. The Blazers eventually pulled in front when Lillard made a trio of free throws, but it was short lived and the Thunder led 82-78 going into the final quarter. ""That's what's fun about our team,"" Paul said afterward. ""It's a team effort every night. As long as we keep playing like that I think we're going to keep grinding."" The teams split their first two games earlier this season. TIP INS Thunder: In the third quarter a fan dropped a phone on the court and Dennis Schroder picked it up and handed it back. ... It was the first of a four-game trip for Oklahoma City. ... Luguentz Dort fouled out with 4:34 left in the game. Trail Blazers: Damian Lillard went 0 for 6 from the field to start the game. His first basket was a floater with less than a minute left in the opening quarter. Then he had 16 points in the third quarter alone. ... Hassan Whiteside finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. REVENGE? Paul got a couple of delay of game penalties, which was the foul when Bell didn't have his shirt tucked in on Friday. One of them on Sunday was that he had his shooting shirt and his pants on when he was checking in, Paul said. ""He got me, got me back,"" Paul said. Asked if he thought it was because of Friday night, Paul responded, ""What do you think?"" Paul added diplomatically that he learned something about the rules, too. MISSING HOOD Lillard said he thought about Hood before the game when the team was watching clips, but the Blazers had to put aside their feelings about their injured teammate before the tip. ""Rodney's my boy, but I knew he wasn't coming out there to warm up and play the game with us. I think it impacted us on the floor (Hood was a starter), but I don't think mentally guys were out there thinking `Oh, We don't have Rodney.' It's what we've been dealt,"" Lillard said.","401160983"
"LOS ANGELES -- Anthony Davis had a season-high 50 points and the Los Angeles Lakers improved to a league-best 21-3 with a 142-125 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. Davis hit a floater with 4:39 remaining to reach 50 points for the fourth time in his career. He was 20 of 29 from the field and made all 10 of his free throws to go along with seven rebounds and six assists.

Each of the Timberwolves' starters had at least 12 points. Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins each had 19 points as Minnesota lost its fourth straight game. Davis had 42 points through three quarters, one more than his previous single-game best this season, 41 points in his return to New Orleans on Nov. 27. He tacked on 15 points in the third, but balanced scoring allowed Minnesota to stay within 110-103 as the quarter closed. It wasn't until the fourth quarter that the Lakers could relax. Davis went hard to the rim against Towns and drew a foul that put the Lakers in the bonus with 5:30 remaining. Davis had eight points during an 11-0 run that gave the Lakers a 73-65 lead at the half. He had 27 through two quarters, making 12 of 15 shots, including his first six attempts from the field. He provided a spark after James got his fourth foul with 2:27 left in the second quarter.

"Paul George teases that one day he'll share his end of the story as to why his time with the Pacers came to an end. (1:25) INDIANAPOLIS --  Paul George had the perfect response to a crescendo of boos Monday night. He silenced the crowd by making play after play and basket after basket. The former Pacers star scored 36 points, grabbed nine rebounds, made a season-high seven 3-pointers and had five assists in his first game in Indianapolis with the Clippers, leading short-handed Los Angeles to a 110-99 victory. ""It brings incentive when the moments are dead, it brings energy when moments are dead, it brings an aggression when moments are light,"" George said. ""I feed off it. It's fun, it makes the game that much more fun to compete in."" While George starred in the lead role, he got plenty of help, too. Montrezl Harrell added 26 points and eight rebounds and helped keep the Pacers at arm's length when they charged back in the final minutes. Patrick Beverley finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, while Maurice Harkless snagged 14 rebounds as the Clippers earned their fourth win in five games. But this night was all about George -- and the fans, many of whom still haven't forgiven him for forcing a summer trade three years ago. And with Kawhi Leonard sitting out, George took charge of his new team and didn't disappoint. He turned the game with a quick scoring flurry late in the second quarter by drawing a foul, making three free throws and then knocking down 3s on the next two possessions to give the Clippers a 55-46 lead. Harrell and Ivica Zubac continued the flurry by making four straight free throws before Zubac capped the 14-4 run with a tip-in that made it 60-48 at the half. ""Given the circumstances, I always want to win here,"" George said. ""And I always enjoy playing here. You put those two together and I'm going to compete on every possession to try to get a win."" George was just warming up. His fifth 3 extended the lead to 18 early in the third quarter and when Indiana cut the deficit to 13, George accounted for all of the Clippers' points in an 8-0 run to make it 84-65 and quiet the crowd. ""They got tired of booing when the fourth quarter came around and I cooled off a bit because they stopped booing,"" George said. Indiana, led by 20 points from Malcolm Brogdon, did make one last run. The Pacers got within 106-99 on T.J. Warren's 13-footer with 1:46 left, but Harkless answered with a layup and the Pacers didn't score another point. ""The last quarter, coach (Nate McMillan) just said go out and play, try to get it down to 10, put some pressure on them and try to make a run,"" Domantas Sabonis said after finishing with a career-high 22 rebounds. ""But we didn't make enough shots at the end."" TIP-INS Clippers: George has scored at least 31 points in three straight games. ... Zubac finished with 13 points. ... Los Angeles outscored Indiana 56-36 in the paint and was 10 of 32 on 3s. ... The Clippers won at Indiana for the first time since January 2016. Pacers: Sabonis also scored 18 points.

Doug McDermott had 17 points and made five 3s, matching his highest total since joining Indiana last season. ... Jeremy Lamb and T.J. Warren each scored 12. ... Indiana's four game home winning streak ended. INJURY REPORT Leonard sat out on the second night of a back-to-back with a sore left knee. The three-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP has missed seven games this season. The Clippers also played without JaMychal Green (bruised tailbone), Rodney McGruder (strained right hamstring) and Landry Shamet (sprained left ankle). But George doesn't expect Leonard to receive a similar reception when he returns to Toronto on Wednesday. ""The exact opposite of what it was like tonight,"" George said. POOR SHOOTING The Pacers couldn't overcome their poor shooting Monday. They finished at 35.4% from the field, were 10 of 35 on 3s and 21 of 28 from the free-throw line.

"BOSTON --  Gordon Hayward got back in the lineup and helped the Boston Celtics build a big lead. Kemba Walker made sure it didnt completely disappear. Walker led Bostons balanced scoring with 22 points, Hayward had 14 points in his return from a broken hand and the Celtics remained unbeaten at home with a 110-88 victory over the sinking Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. Jaylen Brown had 20 points and seven rebounds, Jayson Tatum added 19 points with 11 boards, and Daniel Theis scored 10 for Boston, which improved to 10-0 at TD Garden. It was good to have him back, Tatum said of Hayward. I was excited, everybody was excited, and he was excited. Jordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 19 points, and Tristan Thompson had 17 points with 11 rebounds. The Cavaliers have lost seven straight games and 13 of 14. Hayward returned exactly a month after breaking his left hand when he collided with San Antonios LaMarcus Aldridge as the Spurs big man was setting a screen. Hayward played 26 minutes, finishing with five rebounds and four assists. He spent the fourth quarter on the bench while his teammates let the Cavs cut into a huge deficit. Cleveland trailed 94-81 before Walker hit a trio of 3-pointers in a 1:22 span to put it away. I just told the team afterwards, I said: If you want to be special, then model (yourself) after Kemba, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Because Kemba sits over there and thinks his nights done, gets put back in the game, drills three 3s, and ends it. Hayward was expected to miss about six weeks. But he said this weekend the bone is healed and -- thanks to a plate with screws -- might even be stronger than it was before. It got hit,"" he told the team's flagship network, NBC Boston, during a postgame interview. ""It didnt even move, hardly. The Celtics, who never trailed, led by 13 at halftime and broke it open by outscoring the Cavaliers 26-10 over the opening 7:53 of the second half. Tatum had eight points and Hayward six in a spree that gave Boston a 79-50 edge. We didnt give in. I think we got down by 30, and then all of a sudden were down by 13, Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. Thats a huge positive that we didnt stop at that point. Cleveland scored 14 straight points spanning the end of the third quarter and early fourth. The Cavaliers sliced the margin to 85-73 on John Hensons layup with just over nine minutes to play, but Tatum nailed a 3 to spark a 7-0 spurt that pushed the Celtics ahead comfortably. Thats how we need to play, Cleveland forward Kevin Love said. The problem is putting it together for a quarter, two quarters, three quarters, 48 minutes. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love played his second straight game after being sidelined with an illness. He scored only seven points.  Collin Sexton came in averaging 20.6 points per game in his career against Boston, but went 1 for 8 in the first half. He finished with eight points. Celtics: G Marcus Smart missed the game with an eye infection and center Robert Williams was sidelined with left hip soreness.  The Celtics won Nov. 5 at Cleveland in the first meeting between the teams this season. QUICK START Boston hit seven of its initial 10 shots, opening its first double-digit lead (17-6) on Haywards fast-break layup -- his first basket of the game -- nearly halfway into the opening quarter. They led 29-18 after one. SEATS FOR SOLDIERS The Celtics and their season-ticket holders combined to give out more than 1,000 seats to the United Service Organizations. MISSING FREEBIES Thompson missed five of his first six free throw attempts and went 1 for 7 from the line. He shot 8 of 11 from the floor. MOMENT OF SILENCE The Celtics held a moment of silence before the national anthem for former Boston College baseball player Pete Frates, who died earlier in the day after a battle with Lou Gehrigs disease. He was 34. Frates helped inspire the ALS ice bucket challenge that has raised more than $200 million worldwide.","401160986"
"CHICAGO --  The Raptors held off the Chicago Bulls and then turned their attention toward the superstar who led them to their first championship in his lone season with Toronto. It figures to be quite a night on Wednesday when Kawhi Leonard visits Toronto for the first time since signing with the Los Angeles Clippers. The NBA Finals MVP will pick up his ring and probably get a warm welcome. ""I think it's going to be a good moment for him and I think he's going to be really, really happy to get his ring,"" Kyle Lowry said. The Raptors were happy to leave Chicago with a victory on Monday night. Pascal Siakam scored 22 points, and Toronto held on to beat the Bulls 93-92 when Zach LaVine missed a runner in the closing seconds. Norman Powell added 17 points, including six in the fourth quarter, and the defending NBA champions ended their first three-game skid since last November. After beating Chicago for the 11th straight time, their focus shifted toward Leonard and the Clippers. ""I would imagine that our fans are going to give him an amazing ovation,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""If they give him one-fifteenth of what they gave us on opening night, it's still going to be something. It was really amazing the night we got ours."" LaVine scored 20 for Chicago -- all in the first half. Wendell Carter Jr. and Daniel Gafford each had 14 points for the Bulls, who made just 12 of 46 3-pointers on the way to their sixth loss in eight games. ""I coach by faith,"" the Bulls' animated Jim Boylen said. ""I coach and teach every day on where I think we're gonna be. When that's gonna happen, when that's gonna break through, I'm not sure. But I'm gonna keep coaching that way."" He insisted the Bulls are making progress even though the losses continue to mount in a season when they expected to contend for a playoff spot. Some fans are staying away, leaving conspicuous empty seats. Boylen insisted the Bulls are playing ""good, hard basketball"" and simply need to win ""two or three more possessions."" ""I'm not gonna let any negativity deter us from that mission,"" he added. Raptors guard Fred VanVleet missed the game because of a bruised right knee. Lowry scored 11 points in his third game after missing 11 in a row with a broken left thumb. The five-time All-Star made 1 of 8 3-pointers, and the Raptors hit 7 of 29 from beyond the arc. HANGING ON Denzel Valentine led the way as Chicago opened the fourth quarter with a 14-6 run that turned a 71-all tie into an 85-77 lead. He nailed a jumper, buried two 3-pointers and fed Gafford for two alley-oop dunks. But the Raptors responded by scoring nine straight, going ahead on Lowry's two free throws with 3:52 remaining. Toronto was leading 89-87 when Chicago's Lauri Markkanen nailed a 3 with 1:45 left. Powell scored for Toronto and Gafford hit a layup to give Chicago a 92-91 lead. Then Lowry scored on a drive with 51 seconds remaining. The Bulls had a chance to win in the closing seconds after an out-of-bounds call got overturned by replay review. Tomas Satoransky inbounded to LaVine, who missed a runner in traffic along the left side. Gafford was unable to control the rebound, and the ball bounced around as time expired. TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse said an MRI showed no structural damage on VanVleet. Averaging 18 points and seven assists, he left in the first half of a loss at Philadelphia on Sunday. ... Siakam scored 13 points in the first quarter. Bulls: Chicago has not beaten Toronto since Feb. 14, 2017. ... Valentine scored a season-high 13 points. ... F Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder sprain) missed his sixth consecutive game. Boylen said Hutchison is not ready for contact in practice. ... Boylen said LaVine (shoulder) and G Coby White (hamstring) are playing through pain.","401160987"
"HOUSTON --  When Luke Walton took over as coach of the Sacramento Kings, he thought Nemanja Bjelica was just a big man he could use to create space. As he's gotten to know Bjelica, Walton has started to see that the 6-foot-10 forward is much more than that, which was clear on Monday night against the Houston Rockets when Bjelica made a 3-pointer at the buzzer to lift the Kings to a 119-118 victory. As I get to know him and see what he's capable of ... (I see) he's a skilled player, Walton said. The game was tied before Russell Westbrook drove into the lane for a layup that put Houston on top with a second to go. After a timeout, Cory Joseph inbounded the ball to Bjelica and his 3-pointer swished through the net to give the Kings the win and send the entire bench onto the court to celebrate. Great pass by Cory and I was open and went deep because I felt good at that range, Bjelica said. And I just took a shot and it went in. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni explained what happened with his team's defense on the final play. Just a breakdown, he said. We just left a guy wide open for no reason whatsoever. Buddy Hield had 26 points to lead the Kings, who had six players score in double figures as they won their second straight after losing the previous three. Hield and the rest of the Kings were thrilled to see Bjelica make such a big play. You saw when he made the shot how everyone loves him, Hield said. He's one of the best teammates on the team so everybody is happy for his success. Westbrook had a season-high 34 points and James Harden added 27 points and 10 assists for Houston. The game was tied earlier in the fourth when Westbrook dished it to Ben McLemore, whose 3-pointer made it 116-113 with 22.7 seconds to go. Hield missed a 3-pointer after that, but Bogdan Bogdanovic grabbed the rebound and got it back to Hield, who didn't miss this time to tie it again with 8.4 seconds left. Westbrook tied it earlier in the period on a layup before Harrison Barnes made it 113-110 with a 3-pointer. The lead was short-lived as Westbrook made a 3 seconds later to tie it again with about a minute left. The Kings led by six after a 3-pointer by Yogi Ferrell with about 9 minutes left. The Rockets scored the next four points before Bogdanovic's 3-pointer pushed Sacramento's lead to 105-102 midway through the quarter. Houston got four quick points from Clint Capela before Harden made two free throws to put the Rockets on top 106-105 with 4 1/2 to play. Harden had a 3-pointer waved off late in the third quarter when he was called for an offensive foul. D'Antoni challenged the call, but it was upheld. Joseph had a three-point play on the other end before Harden made a 3-pointer. This time Trevor Ariza was called for a foul on Harden and Walton challenged the call. Officials ruled that Ariza did foul Harden, but that it was before the shot so three points were taken off the board. Harden made both free throws to put Houston on top, but Barnes added a pair of free throws for Sacramento after that to leave the Kings up 94-93 entering the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Kings: F Marvin Bagley (broken right thumb) is getting close to a return after missing 22 games with his injury, but Walton wouldn't say exactly when he expects him to return. ... Bjelica had 17 points and made three 3-pointers. ... Barnes had 19 points and eight rebounds. Rockets: C Tyson Chandler missed a second straight game with flu-like symptoms. ... G Austin Rivers sat out with an illness. ... P.J. Tucker had 10 points for his fifth game with at least 10 points in the last seven. ... Houston outrebounded Sacramento 51-37. CREATIVE PRACTICE Walton wanted to try some new things on defense against Harden and Westbrook on Monday, but Sacramento's schedule hadn't left any time for practice lately. So he got creative. We put that in this morning in our film session, he said. We had tape down on the floor in the hotel ballroom that we were in and we walked through it in a ballroom. So with that being said, I think our guys did a good job of executing something that is new for us.","401160988"
"MILWAUKEE --  After outscoring opponents by an average of 34 points in their previous four games, the Milwaukee Bucks found out right away things would be tougher Monday when their first two shots were blocked. That slowed the Bucks down, but they still can't be stopped. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 15 rebounds to lead Milwaukee to its 15th straight victory, 110-101 over the Orlando Magic. ""Sometimes, it's good to have close games. You learn from that. You get used to being in close games and not always winning by 20 or 30,"" said Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP. ""We got the win, we grinded it out and played defense, but I think the two days in between made us a little bit rusty."" The Bucks were off Saturday and Sunday. They outrebounded Orlando 54-44, angering Magic coach Steve Clifford. ""You can't come on the road and get smacked on the glass like that. There's got to be some physicality,"" he said. ""Too man hustle points, second-chance points,"" added Aaron Gordon, who had 13 rebounds and 10 points. Khris Middleton scored 20 points for Milwaukee and Dante DiVincenzo added 12 points off the bench. Evan Fournier had 26 points for the Magic, who had won four straight. Terrence Ross scored 23. Ross hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Eric Bledsoe with 50 seconds left to cut the Bucks' lead to 107-101, but he missed the free throw. Then Middleton put away the game by responding with a 3-pointer. At 21-3, Milwaukee is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA's best record. The Bucks' first two shots were rejected by Magic forward Jonathan Isaac, the league's leading shot blocker. In all, Isaac recorded four blocks against four different players before the game was 8  1/2 minutes old. He finished with five blocks. Despite the rough start, the Bucks surged to a 31-18 lead after a 14-0 run late in the first quarter, with forward Ersan Ilyasova sinking two 3-pointers. They led 52-40 at halftime. Orlando shot just 29.5% from the field, including 14.3% from behind the 3-point line, in the first half. ""I think our defense, even though I didn't love the way we played tonight, our first-half defense kind of carried us through,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. The Magic, fueled by six 3-pointers in the third quarter, including three by Ross, drew within five points just before the end of the period. But they couldn't get any closer. TIP-INS Magic: C Mo Bamba was helped to the locker room in the second quarter with a left knee contusion, but returned. . Played without C Nikola Vucevic (right lateral ankle sprain) for the ninth straight game. ... Just as the Magic reached .500 for the first time this season, they faced a brutal trio of games. After the Bucks (1st place, Eastern Conference), they have home games against the Lakers (1st place, Western Conference) and Houston (4th place, West). Bucks: Entered Monday leading the league in points (121) and rebounds (51.8) per game. . Guard George Hill entered Monday leading the league in 3-point field-goal percentage (.516).... In attendance: California high school football coach Rob Mendez, who was born without arms and legs, accompanied by Packers linebacker Blake Martinez. GYM CLOSED The Bucks' being off Saturday and Sunday was a rare occurrence. ""It was well placed for us. But, if we don't play well tonight, we think it's a terrible idea,"" Budenholzer joked before Monday's game. ""I think we had good enforcement on a lockout day yesterday,"" he said of players staying away from the practice facility. KNEED-ING ROSS Ross shot 25 for 51 (49%) during the Magic's winning streak. ""I think, one, he's healthy,"" Clifford said. ""I think that the little knee injury that he had, it didn't prevent him from playing, but he wasn't explosive.""","401160989"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Derrick Rose is 31 and his body has taken a beating, but the 2011 NBA MVP showed once again he can still take over a game and knock down the decisive shot. Rose hit a 14-foot jumper in the lane with 0.3 seconds left and scored 17 of his team-high 21 points in the fourth quarter to lift the Detroit Pistons over the skidding New Orleans Pelicans 105-103 on Monday night. It was Rose's second consecutive strong fourth-quarter performance for the Pistons, who have won four of five. New Orleans lost its ninth straight. ""I don't talk or boast or brag about it, but I still have goals,"" said Rose, who has endured a series of physical setbacks, including an ACL tear, that have resulted in him playing for five teams over the past five years. ""I know overall where I'm at as a player and as a person, and I believe in myself,"" Rose added. ""That's where it all starts -- with me believing in myself -- and going to an organization and playing for a team that believes in me, too. I believe this is the start."" With the game tied at 103, Detroit worked an isolation play for Rose, who dribbled the ball out top against Jrue Holiday, one of the best defenders in the league. Rose drove into the lane, spun to the right and hit his jumper over Holiday's outstretched arms. ""He has everything,"" Holiday said. ""I think it was a good play on his part. I'm not going to take anything from him. He's a great player and the shot that he made was a tough shot. There was nothing I could do about it."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said Rose is not completely recovered from a strained right hamstring that forced him to miss five games last month. But his leg must be improving. In a 108-101 victory over Indiana on Saturday, Rose had 10 fourth-quarter points -- including four in the final 1:14 and a floater in the lane with 18.4 seconds left that iced the game. ""This man has done it,"" Casey said. ""His timing and his rhythm -- I still don't think he's back 100%, but it's coming. We've just got to make sure we play high IQ basketball."" Rose went 7 of 8 from the field and drained both 3-point attempts during his fourth-quarter flurry. After his go-ahead basket, New Orleans inbounded the ball from halfcourt toward Jaxson Hayes, but the rookie center could not get the tying tip-in. Brandon Ingram's 18-foot turnaround gave New Orleans a 103-101 lead with 1:11 to go, but Rose hit a spinning layup to tie it at 103 with 38.7 seconds remaining. Ingram then missed a tough-angle jumper from the left baseline over Blake Griffin, who switched over to guard him in the final 90 seconds. Ingram led the Pelicans with 31 points but scored only four in the fourth quarter. ""We knew Blake couldn't guard Ingram for long periods of time, but for one possession or two possessions, we wanted him to use his physicality (on Ingram), and he used it,"" Casey said. ""He did a great job on him."" Detroit had three players in double figures besides Rose: Langston Galloway (16 points), Luke Kennard (14) and Andre Drummond (13). Drummond also grabbed 10 rebounds. The Pelicans missed their first 10 3-point attempts in the third quarter and Detroit erased a six-point deficit to take a 67-61 lead. TIP-INS Pistons: Improved to 3-9 on the road. . Griffin played well defensively down the stretch, but he had a rough shooting night, going 1 of 9 and finishing with just five points. Pelicans: The team's marketing slogan this season has been ""Won't Bow Down,"" reinforced every game before tipoff by an employee banging a drum at midcourt. In the wake of a 46-point road loss to Dallas on Saturday, the drumbeat was shelved, at least temporarily. ... Derrick Favors, who has missed the last seven games since the unexpected death of his mother, has returned to the team but did not play against Detroit.","401160990"
"PHOENIX --  Kelly Oubre Jr. was ready for a low-key night on the town with friends and family to celebrate his birthday, dressed head to toe in black with a jacket, shirt, pants and shoes. His work was already done and the results were exactly what he wanted. The new 24-year-old had just poured in 24 points to help the Phoenix Suns top the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-109 on Monday. ""It's easy to get lost in the sauce when it comes to the emotions of the game,"" Oubre said. ""It's my birthday, definitely wanted to win, so I just wanted to go out there and do everything I possibly could to get the win."" Devin Booker led the Suns with 26 points, Oubre shot 8 of 15 from the field and Ricky Rubio finished with 16 points and 14 assists. The Suns won at home for the first time since Nov. 14, snapping a four-game losing streak at Talking Stick Resort Arena. Dario Saric added 20 points for Phoenix. Rubio has dished out at least 13 assists in three straight games and had only one turnover on Monday. ""You better keep your eyes up, don't get hit in the head with it, because it's going to come if you're open,"" Oubre said of Rubio's passes. ""He's just a wizard with it. He can do a lot of things on the basketball court that, looking at him, you wouldn't think he could do."" Minnesota lost its fifth in a row. The Timberwolves were led by Karl Anthony-Towns, who scored 33 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. He shot 12 of 18 from the field. Andrew Wiggins added 23 points and Jeff Teague had 16 off the bench. ""Not a good road trip for our defense,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Not a good road trip for us in general. We have things we need to clean up going home. We will have challenges but opportunities."" Phoenix trailed by three at halftime but rallied for a 94-85 advantage at the end of the third quarter. The Suns pushed that margin to 12 early in the fourth after Rubio's 3-pointer. The Timberwolves made a few small runs in the final period but could never get the deficit under seven. Rubio hit another 3 with 4:26 left to push the Suns ahead 111-98, and they cruised in the final minutes. ""We dug deep, found out what worked and spread the love,"" Oubre said. Towns had 21 points and eight rebounds in the first half as the Timberwolves took a 64-61 halftime lead. Oubre and Saric both scored 13 for the Suns. DEFENSIVE THIRD Suns coach Monty Williams said the game was won in the third quarter when his team held the Timberwolves to 21 points. Minnesota had 44 points in the paint in the first half, but Phoenix made it much tougher after the break. ""It wasn't anything we changed,"" Williams said. ""We just made a concerted effort to do what we wanted to do better."" PLAYOFF POSITION It's probably a little early to talk about playoff positioning, but the Suns and Timberwolves appear to be among the teams that could end up fighting for the final few spots in the Western Conference. Phoenix is 11-12 and tied with Oklahoma City for seventh place. Minnesota fell to 10-13 and is tied with Sacramento for the No. 9 spot. The top eight teams make the playoffs. ""We've been losing games that are important, that might come back to haunt us,"" Wiggins said. Said Anthony-Towns: ""We know the team we can be, we've just got to go out there and act and get it done."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Jake Layman (toe sprain) missed his ninth straight game. ... Towns scored at least 30 points against the Suns for the fourth time in his five-year career. The 33 points were a career high for him in the series. Suns: C Aron Baynes returned after missing nine of the past 10 games because of hip and calf injuries. Baynes has been productive when healthy this season, averaging 14.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. He played 15 minutes on Monday, finishing with 12 points and four rebounds. ... The Suns are 11-0 when leading after three quarters.","401160991"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Dennis Schroder's basketball identity is built on being aggressive at both ends of the court. Schroder is flourishing in his sixth man role because he goes into attack mode and never stops. That paid off again for the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 104-90 victory over the Utah Jazz on Monday night. Schroder's 27 points paced a Thunder second unit that outscored the Jazz reserves 45-23 in bench points. Schroder also made plenty of noise on the defensive end, pressuring multiple players into low-percentage shots and creating a turnover-friendly environment for a Utah team prone to making turnovers in bunches. ""I just try to impact the game when I get in,"" said Schroder, who set his career-high of 41 points in a game against the Jazz last season. ""Try to make the right plays offensively and defensively. It's just energy coming in and playing with pace."" Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points and Chris Paul added 16 points and seven assists for Oklahoma City. Steven Adams chipped in with 11 points and 13 rebounds. The Thunder shot 47% from the field after getting a big lift from the bench. It marked the 19th time in 23 games Oklahoma City has outscored its opponent in bench points. Schroder has led the bench in scoring in 19 of those contests. ""It's probably not talked enough about how selfless Dennis is,"" Paul said. ""Dennis a starter in this league on just about any other team. He's a star in his role and that's why our bench is so good."" Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points to lead the Jazz. Rudy Gobert added 19 points and 17 rebounds. The Jazz shot just 40% from the field and had just seven baskets in the third quarter when the Thunder pulled away for good. Utah lost for the sixth time in eight games and finds itself mired in an early season slow start yet again. ""It's kind of like a here-we-go-again situation,"" Mitchell said. ""It's only my third year, so I'm still trying to figure things out as well ... the biggest thing is to stick with it and trust. I ain't got much else to say besides that."" Utah and Oklahoma City traded big runs in the first half. The Jazz surged ahead 24-19 late in the first quarter on the strength of a 13-2 run. Gobert highlighted the spurt with back-to-back baskets -- part of the 14 points he scored before halftime. The Thunder answered with a 18-5 run that extended into the second quarter. Schroder got things going with a pair of baskets before the first quarter ended. Paul capped it off with back-to-back baskets, giving Oklahoma City a 37-29 lead. Oklahoma City stayed in front for the remainder of the game. The Thunder opened their first double-digit lead in the third quarter, going up 85-65 behind a 19-4 run. Schroder did most of the damage during the outburst, scoring four total baskets. His driving layup ignited the run and his third 3-pointer of the game finished it. ""We want to make sure he stays aggressive,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""He can get to his spots. He kind of knows what his shots are and his spots are. . We just want him to play with confidence. The team believes in him. I believe in him."" RISING ROOKIE Dealing with an injury-depleted roster, Donovan played guard Luguentz Dort 20-plus minutes for the second straight game. Dort made the most of his time on the court. The rookie, who is on a two-way contract, finished with a career-high nine points and a pair of rebounds in 29 minutes. He is averaging 5.5 points and 2.5 rebounds on Oklahoma City's current road trip. ""You wouldn't know he's a rookie, the way he's competing,"" Paul said. ""You just have to be ready when your name is called, and he's been unbelievable."" NO FOUL ZONE Utah shot just 12 free throws, matching a season-low. The Jazz had zero attempts in the fourth quarter. The inability to get to the foul line summed up a game in which the Jazz were low on energy and lacked aggressiveness in the second half. Utah turned the ball over frequently on drives to the basket or just settled for mediocre outside shots. ""Our decision making, collectively, that's where we need to come together and help each other on the offensive end,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""At the same time, we need to impose our will on the game, on that end."" TIP INS Thunder: Danilo Gallinari did not play because of a left ankle sprain. Terrance Ferguson also missed his third straight game because of right hip soreness. ... Darius Bazley collected a career-high seven rebounds. ... Oklahoma City forced 15 turnovers and scored 19 points off those miscues. Jazz: Mike Conley missed his third straight game with left hamstring tightness. .

"SAN FRANCISCO --  Ja Morant squashed the Golden State Warriors hopes for their first winning streak of the season. The rookie guard returned to Memphis lineup and scored 26 points to lead the Grizzlies to a 110-102 victory Monday night. Morant added seven assists, two rebounds and a steal in 29 minutes after missing the previous four games with a sore back. The No. 2 pick in the draft came up particularly big for Memphis (7-16) in the fourth quarter, scoring 13 points as the Warriors tried to claw their way back into it. Theres a lot of trust with the ball in his hands to make the right play, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. He had a couple assists late that we needed. Big moments for him, and its awesome to see so early in his career. The Warriors (5-20) finished a five-game road trip with a victory in Chicago on Friday and were trying to win consecutive games for the first time this season. Despite long-term injuries to stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, their roster is healthier and the bench deeper than its been in weeks. But Golden State shot just 38% from the floor and looked out of sync on both ends of the court for much of the night. I honestly think we just (messed) around with the game, forward Draymond Green said. Were not good enough to do that. Our transition defense was bad.  We played pretty horrible the entire game. It was definitely disappointing. Dillon Brooks scored 17 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 16 for the Grizzlies, who won for just the second time in 11 games. DAngelo Russell and Alec Burks each scored 18 for the Warriors, but Russell shot just 6 of 22. Morant, who entered the night leading NBA rookies at 18.6 points per game, was one of several Grizzlies who had an answer every time Golden State tried to make a run. With just over a minute remaining and the Warriors within 106-100, Morant drove the middle of the lane and went flying for a monster dunk that hushed the Chase Center crowd. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Brandon Clarke, who has been bothered by left hip and left oblique soreness, missed his fourth game in a row.  Kyle Anderson didnt play after testing out his sore right heel in warmups. Warriors: Jacob Evans III, sidelined since Oct. 28 with a left hip strain, played nine minutes in his return Monday.  Damion Lee, out with a fractured right hand, originally was listed as probable, but coach Steve Kerr said he needs more time before returning to the active roster. ALLENS INJURY Grayson Allen scored 15 points for Memphis and hit a couple timely shots from beyond the arc when the Warriors tried to rally. But Allen left the game in the third quarter after twisting his right ankle. Hopefully hes back pretty soon, Jenkins said. KERR ON GUN CONTROL On Monday night, the Warriors hosted a group of first responders and others affected by a mass shooting in Gilroy, California in July that left four dead and many more injured. Kerr, who has been outspoken about gun violence, was asked about the issue before the game and reiterated his feelings about the need for background checks before someone purchases a gun. The first thing that has to happen is our government officials have to decide that the safety of our citizens is more important than the money they receive from the NRA (National Rifle Association), Kerr said.","401160993"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Miles Bridges said he spent most of his rookie season thinking about highlight-reel plays. But the ultra-athletic 6-foot-6, 225-pound Charlotte Hornets forward, who was featured in the NBA All-Star Game dunk contest last season, said his mentality has changed in year two. ""This year it's about doing anything to get the win,"" Bridges said. ""(I'm) focusing my defensive assignment, trying to be aggressive and making plays in the clutch."" Devonte Graham scored 29 points, Bridges hit a huge 3-pointer with 7.7 seconds left and the Hornets beat the Washington Wizards 114-107 on Tuesday night in a game that featured 20 lead changes. Terry Rozier scored 17 points, Bridges had 16, P.J. Washington added 15 and Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo both had double-doubles as Charlotte salvaged a 2/3 record on a five-game homestand. Davis Bertans scored a career-high 32 points and made eight 3-pointers for Washington. Rui Hachimura added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Wizards, who have lost six of seven. ""The guy is a bucket-getter,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Bertans. ""Every shot is a great shot because it's always squared up. He has a great release. It's such a high release and he's 6-10."" While Bridges' 3 stood out, Hornets coach James Borrego said he likes that the former Michigan State standout is attacking the basket more often. ""For our offense to be successful, we have to get the rim,"" Borrego said. ""We have to put pressure on the rim. If we just play on the perimeter, that won't work. And Miles is one of those guys who can put pressure on the rim, whether it's a post-up or rim attack or drive or offensive rebound. When he does that, he creates offense for us."" Graham said when Bridges drives, it opens things up for other players. ""I keep telling to him be aggressive,"" Graham said. ""Bradley Beal was talking to him a little bit, so it kind of turned him up a little bit. I love it when he plays like that. He has the body to play like that and he needs to do it every time."" The Hornets led by one when Graham drove the left side of the lane, scored on a left-handed scoop layup and drew the foul for a three-point play with 1:34 left. Rozier added one of two free throws before Bertans made a 3 from the wing to cut Charlotte's lead to 109-107 with 31.4 seconds left. With the Wizards pressing up on the ball, Graham passed to Washington, who found Bridges alone in the right corner for a 3 that the lefty swished to make it a two-possession game and essentially seal Washington's fate. ""I thought DB (Bertans) was huge,"" Washington's Ish Smith said. ""He got us back in the game, but we just came up short."" TIP-INS Wizards: Beal picked up a technical foul in the final seconds of the first half for arguing that he got fouled on a coast-to-coast dunk. Beal had a rough night all around. He had 16 points but was 0 for 7 from 3-point range. Hornets: Marvin Williams sat out his second straight game with knee soreness. ... The Hornets held the Wizards to 48 points in the first half, their fewest allowed in the opening half this season. GRAHAM'S ADJUSTMENTS With his dramatic improvement in his second season, Graham is now starting to see different looks on defense. Teams are blitzing him, playing him full court and face-guarding him. But Graham keeps on producing. ""He's just reading the defense right now,"" Borrego said. ""If he can get downhill, he gets downhill, when they bring the big up he knows he's got to pocket pass, so this is just him learning on the fly right now. Teams are throwing different coverages at him. We'll see a different coverage (Wednesday) night."" ANOTHER INJURY As if the Wizards don't have enough injuries, starting guard Isaac Bonga left the game in the second quarter after getting off-balance while driving to the basket and hitting the back of his head on the floor. The Wizards were already without John Wall, Thomas Bryant, Jordan McRae, Isaiah Thomas and CJ Miles.","401160994"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid threw the ball over his shoulder into the basket and celebrated the no-look shot with a little shake and shimmy for the crowd. It was vintage Embiid -- and something the fun-loving center wants to do more. Yes, the 76ers are winning. But their star big man wants to be in the middle of it. Embiid scored 22 points, including two key free throws with 15.3 seconds left, and Tobias Harris added 20 to keep Philadelphia perfect at home with a 97-92 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night. Matisse Thybulle added 13 points for the Sixers, who are 13-0 in Philadelphia. They have won three straight and seven of eight. Embiid added 10 rebounds but once again struggled offensively down the stretch. After being benched late in Philadelphia's 110-104 win over Toronto on Sunday for committing three straight turnovers, he missed a 3-pointer, a jumper and committed a turnover in crunch time before making the two big foul shots. Fortunately for the 76ers, their defense clamped down on Denver down the stretch. ""I need to be myself,"" Embiid said. ""When I'm having fun, I dominate."" Embiid said he has cut back on the extra-curricular activity while trying to be more mature since his two-game suspension for fighting Karl-Anthony Towns on Oct. 30, which was followed by a postgame barrage of insults on social media. Embiid, however, let loose after his improbable shot ended the third quarter with Philadelphia ahead 83-76, and the crowd loved it. ""I need to do it more,"" he said. A two-time All-Star, Embiid entered averaging 21.9 points and 12.5 rebounds per game after putting up 27.5 points and 13.6 boards last season. Will Barton had 26 points to lead the Nuggets, who have lost three in a row and five of six. Leading scorer Jamal Murray was injured with 6:49 left in the first quarter when he collided with Ben Simmons and didn't return. The Nuggets set a franchise record for largest fourth-quarter comeback when they rebounded from 19 points down to start the final period in a 100-97 win over Philadelphia in Denver on Nov. 8. They tried again, but couldn't come all the way back this time. The 76ers led by 10 early in the fourth after Josh Richardson's deep 3-pointer from the top of the key made it 88-78 with 8:54 remaining. The Nuggets scored the next eight, capped by Barton's three-point play with seven minutes left, to pull to 88-86. But then Thybulle hit a pivotal 3 and grabbed a big offensive rebound on Philadelphia's next possession, which ended with Al Horford's jumper that put the 76ers in front 93-86 with 4:36 to play. ""You could feel the building light up,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said of Thybulle's impact. ""He's an energy giver when he can make those plays."" Denver had chances from that point on but went cold from the field, making just one field goal until Nikola Jokic's runner made it 95-92 with 18.9 seconds left. The Nuggets had just six points in the last seven minutes, missing seven of nine shots. Nuggets coach Michael Malone liked his team's resolve but said the lack of offensive execution is a recurring problem. ""Our offense has been holding us back and tonight was another example,"" he said. ""We have to find ways to be more consistent."" HOME SWEET HOME Philadelphia is within nine victories of matching the franchise mark for consecutive home wins to start a season, set during the 1966-67 season. ""It says we have a great crowd and great focus here,"" Harris said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone received a technical with 7:16 left in the first half. . Barton scored the first 13 Denver points. . Jokic had 15 points, seven rebounds and 11 assists. ... Murray went scoreless and left with what the team called a ""trunk contusion."" 76ers: Richardson returned to the lineup after missing six games with a right hamstring strain. He had three points.","401160995"
"MIAMI -- Trae Young figured the game was over. Turns out, Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat were just getting started -- on one of the wildest stat nights in team history. Duncan Robinson tied a franchise record with 10 3-pointers, Butler and Bam Adebayo each had triple-doubles, and the Heat went on a late flurry to beat the Atlanta Hawks 135-121 in overtime Tuesday. The Heat were down by six with 59 seconds left in regulation when Young took a celebratory walk to the Atlanta bench for a timeout, with Butler hearing him shout, ""It's over!"" Miami scored the next 22 points -- the final six of regulation and the first 16 of overtime -- to improve to 18-6 overall and 11-0 at home. ""I don't think anybody really thought the Heat were relevant,"" Adebayo said. ""We're making people watch us."" Kendrick Nunn scored a career-high 36 points, one off the Heat rookie single-game record. Robinson scored 34, a career high. Adebayo finished with a career-high 30 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. Butler had 20 points, a career-high 18 rebounds and 10 assists. Afterward, Butler couldn't resist a jab at Young on Instagram, writing: ""this man @traeyoung is a teller of the future. he was right. game WAS over!"" Young also took to social media and acknowledged his mistake in a short tweet. Butler praised his teammates, telling reporters, ""Everybody in this locker room has a confidence that they're the best player on the floor at any given time. Man, when you've got guys who think like that, nothing's ever over."" It was the NBA's widest margin of victory in an overtime game since Oct. 31, 2009, when Philadelphia beat New York 141-127. De'Andre Hunter scored 28 points and Young added 21 points and nine assists for Atlanta, which fell to 0-3 against the Heat this season. ""What's tough is Robinson goes 10-for-14, a career high, two guys with triple-doubles, they played out of their minds a little bit with a couple guys, and we still had a six-point lead with under a minute to go,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I feel bad."" Vince Carter, in the 1,500th regular-season game of his career, scored 12 for the Hawks. Jabari Parker had 16 points and Cam Reddish added 14 for Atlanta. The Hawks used a 13-0 run to take an eight-point lead early in the fourth before the Heat clawed back and tied the score 111-111 on a 3-pointer by Robinson with 3:11 left. Atlanta scored the next four to reclaim the lead, Butler missed a pair of free throws with 1:18 left, and Alex Len had a dunk on the next Hawks possession for a 117-111 lead. The rest was all Heat. ""Our energy was dead as soon as overtime started,"" Young said. In other words, it was over. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta made 13 3-pointers in the first half, tying a team record set on three other occasions. The Hawks had only nine 2-pointers before intermission. ... Hunter returned to the starting lineup and Reddish played off the bench. ... Kevin Huerter (shoulder) remains on a minutes restriction of about 25 per night, though that isn't expected to last much longer. He played 26 in regulation, then didn't play in overtime. Heat: Miami again played without four of its six highest-paid players. Goran Dragic (groin strain), Justise Winslow (back strain), James Johnson (illness) and Dion Waiters (illness) were out. Dragic is working toward a return. Winslow has missed 14 of Miami's 24 games, Johnson has made only six appearances, and Waiters has yet to play. FAREWELL, VINCE Barring a playoff meeting or trade, this was Carter's final game in Miami. He appeared in Miami as an opponent 36 times including playoffs, tying Allan Houston for third most all time behind Paul Pierce's 42 and Patrick Ewing's 37. Carter's 714 points are fourth most of any opponent in Miami, behind Pierce's 867, Ewing's 754 and Michael Jordan's 722. STAR WARS NIGHT The Heat threw a Star Wars-themed celebration, replete with lightsabers on the court during the pregame delivery of the game ball, Darth Vader patrolling the arena and radio analyst Ruth Riley Hunter with her hair done like Princess Leia. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is a fan of the sci-fi saga. ""Every summer, the whole family gets together in Hawaii, and we end up watching Star Wars,"" Spoelstra said.","401160996"
"In the wake of an easy win, the Portland Trail Blazers agreed they needed the rout for their own morale. Damian Lillard had 31 points, including eight 3-pointers, and Portland handed the wretched New York Knicks their 10th straight loss, 115-87 on Tuesday night. Anytime you have that type of win, and the way that we did it, I think we should feel good about it, especially in a game that we feel we should have won,"" Lillard said. Hassan Whiteside added 17 points and 15 rebounds as the Blazers ended a two-game skid. Portland led by as many as 32. Those kind of games feel good,"" coach Terry Stotts weighed in. Julius Randle had 15 points for the Knicks, who have won just four games, fewest in the NBA. They have one victory on the road. The Knicks opened their four-game West Coast trip in disarray after coach David Fizdale was fired on Friday, just hours after he ran practice. Mike Miller was named interim head coach, and New York lost 104-103 at home to Indiana the next night. In an 82-game schedule you may have some nights where it won't go in, and we found ourselves in that, Miller said. In Portland, New York faced Carmelo Anthony, who played for the Knicks from 2011-17. When the Blazers picked up Anthony on Nov. 19, the 10-time All-Star had been out of the game for more than a year. But he has fit in well with Portland as a starter, averaging nearly 16 points and six rebounds a game. Anthony finished with 16 points. We were locked in, since this morning, since shootaround, we were locked in, Anthony said. Dame came out and led us, Hassan played great, but I thought overall defense was what got us going. We were talking, we were active, a lot of energy on the defensive end. Portland was coming off a 108-86 defeat at home to Oklahoma City on Sunday, with the team still reeling from the loss of Rodney Hood, who tore his left Achilles tendon in a loss to the Lakers on Friday. Hood will miss the rest of the season. Lillard's step-back 3 put the Blazers up 32-22 at the end of the first quarter. Lillard had 17 points in the opening period. Portland led by as many as 21 in the half and was up 60-41 at the break behind 25 points from Lillard. The Knicks were 2 of 15 from 3-point range in the first half and 7 of 38 for the game. Lillard's 28-foot 3-pointer put the Blazers up 74-47 midway through the third quarter. He didn't play in the fourth. Anthony and CJ McCollum went to the bench for good early in the fourth. Miller also sat his starters for much of the final period. It was a team we felt we should (beat) on our home floor, but I thought our approach and how we came out, not looking like it was going to be an easy game or nothing like that -- we respected our opponent,"" Lillard said. We did the right things defensively, we executed our scouting report and offensively we executed as well as we have in a while, maybe all season. TIP-INS Knicks: New York hasn't beaten Portland since November 2016, losing six straight. ... Mitchell Robinson added 14 points for his ninth game in double figures this season. ... Miller was asked about whether the team was down after the lopsided loss: I think it's hard anytime when that happens. That's maybe the biggest challenge for any team is when someone is going good, you try to answer, and you miss a few of those shots. Trail Blazers: A report surfaced earlier Tuesday that Kevin Love, currently with the Cleveland Cavaliers, would be interested in playing for Portland. Love grew up in Oregon and was a star at Lake Oswego High School. The Blazers are considered candidates to make deals when trade restrictions lift on Dec. 15 because of their need at forward. IN THE ZONE The Blazers went to a zone defense on a couple of possessions. Stotts said the team was just experimenting. The way things are going, we are trying different things, different lineups, he explained. ""I talked to the assistants earlier today about, what can we look at? We are trying to find different things.""","401160997"
"CLEVELAND --  James Harden dropped another one of those demoralizing step-back 3-pointers that have made him famous, causing Cavaliers rookie Kevin Porter Jr. to look at Cleveland's bench for help. Nothing could be done. ""He made a lot of shots you can't do anything about,"" Porter said. A lot of them is right. Harden scored 55 points -- 20 in the fourth quarter -- and Russell Westbrook added 23 points as the Houston Rockets withstood an unexpected scare from Cleveland and held on for a 116-110 win Wednesday night over the free-falling Cavs, who have lost eight straight and 14 of 15. Harden made four 3-pointers and shot 7 of 8 in the fourth while matching Kyrie Irving's arena record for points in a game. His fourth 50-point performance this season bailed out the Rockets, who allowed the Cavs to score 24 straight points in the second half. ""He's incredible,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""If it was the first time he's done this, I'd be like, `Wow! Look at that,' but he's done it at this level for years."" Harden became the fourth player in NBA history with multiple games of 10 or more 3-pointers, joining Golden State's Stephen Curry (15) and Klay Thompson (5), and former Cavs guard J.R. Smith (3). Cleveland was still leading 108-107 when Harden, who came in as the league's top scorer at 38 points per game, dropped a floater in the lane with 1:03 left. After a turnover by Cavs guard Jordan Clarkson, P.J. Tucker hit a 3 from the corner and Clint Capela had a dunk following another Cleveland miscue. The inexperienced Cavs crumbled in the final minute, committing three turnovers. But it was their inability to slow down Harden that was their biggest undoing. His 55 points seemed almost effortless, as if he could score whenever he pleased. Need a bucket? Call on Harden. A 3-pointer? He's the man. Whatever Houston needed, Harden got it for the Rockets. ""We caught a guy who plays at an MVP level,"" Cleveland forward Kevin Love said. ""He couldn't miss."" Harden finished 20 of 34 from the floor, including 10 of 18 on 3s. He made all five free throws, and added eight assists and two steals. ""Good defense turned into James Harden offense,"" D'Antoni said. ""I've got nothing but praise for him on the defensive end, in addition to the offensive end. He realized that for us to win big, he's got to do it (play defense) -- and he is doing it. He's always in the right position."" Harden shrugged off another big personal night, saying the Rockets have learned they're going to get the other team's best shot every game. ""We're a great team,"" he said. ""We get their best whether they come to our place or when we're on the road -- so teams are like, `We're playing the Rockets, so we have extra juice."" Capela added 13 rebounds for Houston, which figured to have an easy time with the Cavs, who are struggling under first-year coach John Beilein. Cleveland, though, came to play and was led by Porter's season-high 24 points. Collin Sexton added 18 and Love had 17 points and 11 boards. Harden connected on a pair of 3-pointers during a 16-2 run in the third quarter when the Rockets, who were sleepwalking through long stretches of the first half, appeared to take control. But Houston relaxed, and Cleveland went on a jaw-dropping 24-0 run -- all without Love, who was on the bench -- over a 4:53 stretch bridging the third and fourth quarters to a take a 99-88 lead on Porter's bucket. Harden stopped the Cavs' surge with basket in the lane and scored Houston's next 13 points. LONG RUN Cleveland's 24-point spurt was the club's longest since a 29-0 burst on Dec. 6, 2009, against Milwaukee. POINT, COUNTER POINT Harden became the third player to score at least 50 in the building's history, joining Irving (55) and Allen Iverson (54, 50), who did it twice. TUNED OUT Beilein said the increased trade chatter surrounding Love has not been a distraction. ""I've been hearing about that from the day I was hired,"" said Beilein, echoing his predecessors. ""Whatever happens in this basketball business happens. We want Kevin to play at his best and I'm sure he does as well. We hope that happens today and every day going forward."" TIP-INS Rockets: Irving scored 55 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Jan. 28, 2015. ... Houston tied a club record with its ninth straight game scoring at least 115 points. ... Harden's 868 points through 23 games were the most since Rick Barry had 886 in 1966-67. ... Harden, who also leads the league in minutes per game, is the only player averaging more than 25.0 points and 2.0 steals. . C Tyson Chandler (illness) missed his third game in a row, while G Austin Rivers (illness) sat out his second straight. Cavaliers: Beilein said he and his staff discussed changing the starting lineup but stuck with the same five: Love, Sexton, Cedi Osman, Tristan Thompson and Darius Garland. ""We've really done some studying which five-man groups or even two-man combinations play best together,"" he said. ""We may be onto some things."" ... Garland is one of 11 rookies averaging double digits in scoring.","401160998"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana aced one major test Wednesday. Now coach Nate McMillan expects the Pacers to continue putting up high marks. Malcolm Brogdon scored 29 points and made all 15 of his free throws, the Holiday brothers combined for 20 fourth-quarter points and Indiana rallied from a 10-point deficit to finally beat the Boston Celtics 122-117. ""One of our problems all season has been closing out these games against elite teams,"" Brogdon said. ""Tonight we were able to do that so it will definitely help our confidence. The rebuilt Pacers snapped a seven-game losing streak against Boston, which included a first-round playoff sweep last season. They managed to dig themselves out of a 94-84 hole to start the fourth quarter with teamwork, defense and patience. And they did it with injured All-Star Victor Oladipo cheering throughout the stretch run. The fact this performance came on a night three-time All-Star Kemba Walker scored a season-high 44 points, making seven 3-pointers and dishing out seven assists to lead Boston only made it sweeter. ""He's obviously one of the great players in the league and once he gets downhill, it's tough to stop him,"" Aaron Holiday said. ""I just tried to fight over the screens and hoped my bigs could help me at the rim."" For McMillan, it was precisely the kind of effort he talked about Monday as the Pacers entered their most challenging three-week stretch so far. And against an old nemesis in Boston, the Pacers played it perfectly. They withstood Walker's 15-point first quarter, his scoring flurries at the end of the first half and start of the second half, even the 12-2 run Walker and Jayson Tatum spurred to close out the third quarter. So with Walker on the bench, Indiana took advantage and turned the game with a team effort. The Pacers forced five turnovers in the first 8 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter to close to 98-96. Doug McDermott finally tied the score at 102 with two free throws at the 5:07 mark. Aaron Holiday gave Indiana a 105-104 lead with 4:16 left and Justin Holiday added gave Indiana a 114-109 lead with 1:26 left. Brogdon made six free throws in the last 17.1 seconds and Walker fired an airball on a 3 that would have tied it with 4 seconds to go. Boston's four-game winning streak ended. ""I just missed,"" said Walker, who was 2 of 7 in the fourth. ""I took some good ones, maybe a few that weren't so good but I just missed."" TIP-INS Celtics: Guard Marcus Smart missed his second straight game with a left eye infection. ... Boston had assists on each of its first 11 baskets. ... Jaylen Brown had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists before fouling out. ... Tatum finished with 16 points, Brad Wanamaker had 12 and Daniel Theis scored 11. ...

Brogdon also had eight assists and had the best free-throw shooting performance by a Pacer since Danny Granger made all 16 of his attempts on March 1, 2011. ... Indiana's bench outscored Boston's 47-19... BACK HOME AGAIN Trips to Indianapolis are usually enjoyable for Boston coach Brad Stevens, who led nearby Butler to two Final Four appearances after growing up in Brownsburg -- an Indianapolis suburb. And he's far from alone. Gordon Hayward also grew up on the west side of Indianapolis and played on Butler's first Final Four team. Rookie guard Carsen Edwards starred at Purdue and rookie guard Romeo Langford was the state's 2018 Mr. Basketball Award winner. He played at Indiana University last year and had a large group of supporters make the trip from his southern Indiana hometown, New Albany, for the game. OLADIPO UPDATE McMillan said Oladipo looks better in practice and continues to make progress, but there's still no timetable for his return from a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee. He suffered the injury in January. ""He's still rehabbing, working hard and he's certainly getting better,"" McMillan said. ""He's getting closer but I think he's still a ways off.""","401160999"
"LeBron James explains how he was able to achieve a triple-double in the Lakers' win vs. the Magic. (0:44) ORLANDO, Fla. --  LeBron James has made a career out of carrying his team through tough stretches, and in his 17th season, he hasnt lost a step. James had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his sixth triple-double this season, helping the Los Angeles Lakers to a 96-87 win over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. Anthony Davis had 16 points and 12 rebounds and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 15 for the Lakers, who have won 13 of 14. But it was James who was the deciding factor, accounting for every point in a 10-0 run that broke a 71-71 tie early in the fourth quarter. Orlando had rallied from 24 points down to tie it at 71-all on a 3-pointer from Michael Carter-Williams with 10:48 left in the game. James pulled the plug on the Magic comeback. He assisted on the Lakers next three possessions, hitting a cutting Avery Bradley in the lane for a layup, Alex Caruso for a corner 3 and Jared Dudley for another wide open 3-pointer. He is the best in the world for a reason, Caruso said. Him just getting to the paint draws so many bodies the were open on the backside. He creates a lot of attention so its up to us to play off that and we did a good job tonight.. James finished the run with a defensive rebound and a bullish drive through the Magic defense for a layup and 81-71 lead with 7:47 left in the game. The Magic never got closer than five after that. LeBron was great, especially down the stretch, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. He quarterbacks the action for us, keeping the lead at a healthy distance and making plays on the defensive end. Jonathan Isaac led Orlando with 19 points, all in the second half. Evan Fournier had 18 and Aaron Gordon finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. Mo Bamba had 13 points. Orlando had to dig itself out of a 26-9 deficit after the first quarter. The Magic shot just 19% (4 of 21) in the quarter and gifted the Lakers five turnovers to go with the poor shooting. That first quarter is us not understanding who youre playing against or what our team has to do to play well, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. It took us 10, 11 minutes to get locked into what we had to do, and then we played fine. The Magic hit three straight 3-pointers, two by Fournier, to start the second half and eventually cut what had been a 24-point deficit to 57-55 on a dunk by Khem Birch with 7:27 left in the third period. Los Angeles never gave up the lead, but had trouble getting into any flow against an aggressive Orlando defense. SMARTER COACH NOW Frank Vogel returned to Orlando for the first time since being fired by the Magic in 2018. Vogel won just 32.9% (54-110) of his games in two seasons in Orlando. He is winning 87.5% of the time his first year in Los Angeles. Of course, he didnt have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on his Magic roster. All coaches are smarter with great players, Vogel said. TIP INS Lakers: Jared Dudley was ejected from the game with 7:06 for fighting.  Los Angeles missed its first six 3-point attempts of the game, then six of their next eight before halftime.  The Lakes committed 11 turnovers in the first half. Magic: Wes Iwandu was ejected from the game with 7:06 to play for fighting.  Starting PG Markelle Fultz sat out the game with stomach flu.  Three Magic starters got shut out and Aaron Gordon scored just one point in that period.","401161000"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard got his ring, and the Los Angeles Clippers got another win. Leonard scored 23 points in his return to Toronto, Lou Williams had 18 and the Clippers won their third straight game Wednesday, beating the slumping Raptors 112-92. Maurice Harkless scored 14 points and Paul George had 13 as the Clippers evened their road record at 6-6. Before the game, Leonard received his championship ring from the 2018-19 season, when he helped Toronto beat Golden State in six games for the franchise's first NBA title. Following a pregame video tribute, Leonard's former teammates, along with coaches and team executives, gathered in a circle at center court. As the standing-room-only crowd roared with approval, Leonard embraced each player in turn before guard Kyle Lowry presented him with his ring. After slipping it on, Leonard raised his arms and waved. ""It was great, it was a great moment,"" Leonard said. ""They did a great job putting it together, having all the players out there that won with me, standing there and presenting the ring. ""It was a special season for us, for me, for the whole city and country,"" Leonard added. ""I'm glad we were able to win. It was a blessing."" Leonard didn't put the ring on all the way before the game, but spent some more time with it afterward. ""I sat in the locker room with it for a little bit,"" he said, ""just admiring it and just remembering all the memories and all the hard work that went into it."" Lowry, who was planning to have dinner with Leonard after the game, said he was happy to hand over the diamond-studded hardware. ""He helped this franchise do amazing things and he got his ring,"" Lowry said. Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Leonard was touched by the warm welcome he got from Toronto's fans. ""It meant a lot,"" Rivers said. ""Some players just don't let you in but I can tell you that ovation, to him, was very heartfelt. There's no doubt about that."" Clippers guard Patrick Beverley scored 11 points in 19 minutes before leaving in the third quarter because of a concussion. Beverley collided with Marc Gasol's shoulder as the Raptors center was setting a screen. Pascal Siakam scored 24 points, Norman Powell had 22 and OG Anunoby 13 as the Raptors lost for the fourth time in five games and dropped their third straight at home. Toronto set a franchise record with nine straight home victories to begin the season. The Raptors last lost three straight at home between Nov. 29 and Dec. 5, 2015. The Raptors shot 8 for 36 from 3-point range, their worst mark of the season. Toronto matched a season low with 31 field goals. They also had 31 in a Nov. 29 win at Orlando. ""We're in a period where we're not playing very well here for about a week,"" coach Nick Nurse said. Leonard was held to 12 points, a season low at the time, when the Raptors visited the Clippers on Nov. 11. The three-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP shot 1 for 11 in that game, but Los Angeles won 98-88. Leonard shot 8 for 14 Wednesday, going 2 for 4 from 3-point range and 5 for 5 from the free throw line. ""I thought Kawhi was great,"" Rivers said. ""What I loved about him was he was patient. He just waited. He kept accepting the traps, he kept making the right play."" Leonard returned after sitting out Monday's win at Indiana because of a sore left knee.

Find Devonte' Graham,"" Hornets coach James Borrego joked. ""I learned from Pop (Gregg Popovich) that's a good move. He was rolling."" Graham scored a career-high 40 points, and the Charlotte Hornets rallied from a 20-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 113-108 on Wednesday night. ""I just want to win, that's what I'm thinking,"" Graham said of his mindset down the stretch. ""Make a play."" Graham had 27 points in the second half in Charlotte's second straight victory. Miles Bridges added 14 points. ""It's a mindset as a group,"" Graham said of Charlotte's comeback. ""All of us young guys all come from winning programs, so we know what it's like when you've got a target on your back in college and every team is coming for you and you've got to play every night as hard as you can."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 10 rebounds for Brooklyn, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Graham hit a step-back jumper followed by a deep 3-pointer to give Charlotte a 111-106 lead with 22 seconds remaining. ""When he has big nights, they have a chance to win,"" Dinwiddie said. ""When he doesn't, they're kind of dead in the water."" Dinwiddie cut the lead to 111-108 by hitting two of three free throws with 18 seconds left, but Bridges made a free throw and the Nets misfired on two 3-point attempts on their next possession. In the third quarter, Charlotte went on a 21-7 run to cut the deficit to 84-81. Graham led the comeback with 10 points during the run. The Hornets entered the fourth quarter trailing 86-84. ""I guess we could have double-teamed him,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We could have blitzed him. We did change our pick-and-roll coverage a bunch of times. That didn't seem to help. You call all-out double-team him. We could have done that. Didn't do it. Looking back, maybe should have done it."" The Nets took a 64-53 lead into the half as Allen led all scorers with 16 points. Graham had 13 for Charlotte, which shot 38% from the field in the first half. Brooklyn took it's largest lead at 52-32 during the quarter. Brooklyn took a 34-26 lead after the first quarter while shooting 57% from the floor as Allen led the Nets with 11 points. Charlotte's backcourt of Graham and Terry Rozier each had seven. TIP-INS Hornets: Coach James Borrego praised Allen's development. ""He looks to me like a smarter and more active defender this season,"" Borrego said. . Nicolas Batum (left hand) and Marvin Williams (right knee) were both out. Nets: Kyrie Irving (shoulder impingement) missed his 13th straight game. Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) missed his 15th straight game. LeVert, who underwent right thumb surgery on Nov. 14, is on track to return from his original 4-6 week timeline, coach Kenny Atkinson said. DINWIDDIE STAYS HOT Dinwiddie has registered 20 or points 11 times in his last 13 games.","401161002"
"CHICAGO --  Zach LaVine believes he needs to be a dependable fourth-quarter scorer for the Chicago Bulls to have success. Against Atlanta on Wednesday night, though, he was happy being a spectator. LaVine scored 35 points in three quarters, Lauri Markkanen added 22 and Chicago snapped a three-game losing streak with a 136-102 victory over the road-weary Hawks. LaVine, who sat out the final 14 minutes, was 12 for 15 from the field, including 7 for 7 from 3-point range. ""It feels good; you want to have wins like that,"" the 24-year-old said. ""It does good for the team and the body. I was just more excited about us just keeping the gas on and not have to come back in. ""We played a full game."" Wendell Carter Jr. had 11 points and 10 rebounds and rookie Coby White had 19 points. Trae Young had 15 points and 13 assists, Alex Len scored 17 points and rookie Cam Reddish added 16 for Atlanta, which has dropped two straight and 13 of 15. The Hawks were coming off a 135-121 overtime loss in Miami on Tuesday night -- a game in which they led by six points with less than a minute remaining. Atlanta didn't arrive at its hotel until about 3 a.m. ""We've had our struggles on second nights of back-to-backs,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I thought our guys were competing. It was a great start to the game. I thought it was one of our better starts to the game ... then it's a tough stretch at the end of the first quarter, tough stretch at the end of the second quarter."" Chicago scored the final 10 points of the first half for a 66-52 lead at the break. LaVine led the way with 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting before the intermission. The Bulls continued the surge and took their largest lead to that point, 93-69, on a layup by Carter with 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. LaVine had 17 points in the third on 5-for-6 shooting, including 4 for 4 from long range, as Chicago took a 106-87 lead into the fourth. ""Zach's efficiency was unbelievable,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""He's wants to be great and he's working."" The Bulls, who have blown big leads multiple times, put the game away with a 19-3 run early in the final quarter for a 125-93 lead. It was Chicago's biggest margin of victory since a 39-point win over Brooklyn in April 2017. ""We usually mess up with that,"" LaVine said. ""We finally figured it out today. I think we should have had a couple more wins where we did that. ""Finally, we were able to take a little bit of a break. We have to do more of that."" TIP-INS Hawks: Chicago native and former Bull Jabari Parker had 11 points and seven rebounds in 21 minutes. Bulls: F Otto Porter will be sidelined an additional four-plus weeks after an MRI revealed a small fracture in his left foot. Porter, who hasn't played since Nov. 6, originally was diagnosed with a sprain before a follow-up MRI two weeks later showed a bone bruise. He'll be reassessed in four weeks. ""It's heartbreaking for him and, obviously, difficult for us,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""He's a big wing and a 40% 3-point shooter. His experience, talent, versatility is something we need."" BY THE NUMBERS The announced crowd at the United Center was 15,084 two days following a crowd of 14,775 against the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Before Wednesday, the Bulls were averaging 18,747 per game, but the crowds have been shrinking of late. YOU GOTTA BELIEVE Young's reaction with 59 seconds to go in Miami -- he swung his arms apart and yelled, ""It's over!"" -- received plenty of attention because the Heat scored the next 22 points. Young offered a mea culpa with mostly emojis on Twitter following the game, but coach Lloyd Pierce said he had no issue. ""You gotta love his confidence,"" Pierce said. ""Celebrate. There's nothing wrong with that. It wasn't in anyone's face. He's celebrating his team's success in a position to win on the road.""","401161003"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  With energy on defense and ample shot sharing on the other end, the Utah Jazz discovered the pick-me-up they needed in Minnesota. The Timberwolves would be wise to take notes. Donovan Mitchell had 30 points and six assists, Joe Ingles pitched in a season-high 23 points and the Jazz won 127-116 on Wednesday to stick the Timberwolves with their sixth straight loss. ""We played together, moved the ball, shared the ball, shared everything on both ends,"" Mitchell said. ""That's what makes a good team."" Rudy Gobert added 20 points and 16 rebounds for the Jazz, who won for just the third time in their last nine games by taking over with a 38-24 advantage in the third quarter. Jeff Teague scored 32 points, making all four of his 3-pointers and all six of his free throws, but the Timberwolves dropped their sixth consecutive home game and fell to 3-8 at Target Center this season. They're 7-6 on the road. Andrew Wiggins had 26 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota, but the defense was problematic again, particularly between the paint and the perimeter. ""In the NBA season, there's a number of different tough times, and this is one of them for us,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. The Jazz shot 56.6% from the field. ""The coaching staff has done a great job of putting a system in place,"" Towns said. ""It's more about discipline and execution."" Utah has made its mark on defense under coach Quin Snyder, but that has fallen off lately in a stumble through the last three weeks. Five times in their last nine games, the Jazz allowed 120 or more points, which none of their opponents reached in their first 15 games. They're still eighth in the league in points allowed, but the lackluster communication and decreased intensity has had Snyder concerned. This was a better display, aside from the 36-point second quarter by the Wolves. The Jazz, who had separate spurts of 8-0 and 10-0 in the third quarter to break the game open, kept Towns from getting comfortable. Their ball movement on the other end was the ticket to success, with Jeff Green's corner 3-pointer with 1:58 left in the period a prime example that pushed their lead to double digits for the first time at 90-78. ""Ball movement, talking on defense, being able to get out in transition, and `Big Boy' did his thing locking down Karl,"" Mitchell said, praising Gobert. ""When you do that, it makes our life a lot easier."" Georges Niang tossed in a couple of 3-pointers down the stretch, and the Wolves never gained any more steam. Utah was credited with assists on 15 of 24 second-half field goals. With the Jazz leading 117-102 midway through the fourth quarter, Towns was called for charging after knocking Mitchell over with an elbow to the forehead in the post to negate a basket. ""When we move the defense a little bit, it gives those guys a chance to attack in a better spot,"" Snyder said. ""It was good to see Donovan cutting back and Joe as well being able to find people on the perimeter. I think we had more catch-and-shoot 3s tonight than we did in a while."" TOUGH TEAGUE With rookie Jarrett Culver recently cracking the starting lineup and Saunders preferring to use Wiggins as a primary handler, Teague has had to adjust to both coming off the bench and playing more off the ball. Even if he's in the final year of his contract, in his 11th season in the league, Teague has proven his value beyond just experience, and leadership. He scored 15 points in the second quarter, finishing with a 3-pointer and a reverse layup in the final 32 seconds to forge a 59-all tie. After Mitchell's 3-pointer gave the Jazz a 47-40 lead that was their largest of the half, Teague answered with one of his own just 11 seconds later. He was fighting through a sore left ankle, too, that had him listed as questionable to play earlier in the day. ""He was aggressive, and he was keeping us in the game,"" Saunders said. TIP-INS Jazz: Guard Mike Conley missed his fourth straight game with left hamstring tightness, keeping Ingles in the starting lineup. ... Mitchell shot 8 for 11 from the floor in the first half. Timberwolves: Forward Keita Bates-Diop was scratched with flu-like symptoms, leaving Minnesota a bit thin on the wing. Forward Jake Layman missed his 10th straight game due to a sprained left toe. ... Teague matched his season high and missed his career high by two points, registering his ninth career 30-point game.","401161004"
"PHOENIX --  Rookie Ja Morant had a quiet game by his standards but found himself on the perimeter with 45 seconds remaining, ball in hand and his Grizzlies clinging to a four-point lead. The 6-foot-3 guard dribbled a few times and then blew past Phoenix's 6-foot-10 forward Aron Baynes, who desperately tried to stay in front before Morant elevated and slammed the ball over Baynes' outstretched arms. The Memphis bench howled in delight. A tight game was essentially over and the Grizzlies finished with a 115-108 victory over the Suns on Wednesday night. ""Oh my gosh, I was screaming,"" Memphis guard Dillon Brooks said. ""That's how electric he is. He's a special player -- even if he's having a tough game, he can find a way to electrify. That just put us over the top."" Brooks scored 27 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 and the Grizzlies won two games in a row for the first time in nearly a month. Morant had 13 points, six assists and four rebounds. Jackson shot 10 of 18 from the field, including 3 of 7 from 3-point range, and the Grizzlies improved to 6-0 when Brooks scores at least 20 points. The Grizzlies led 84-79 going into the fourth quarter after Jackson scored 11 points in the third and they pushed their advantage to 91-81 early in the fourth quarter. The Suns pulled within 93-90 with 6:37 left, but couldn't get any closer. ""We were guarding,"" Brooks said. ""We were taking it personal. They beat us at our house, so we wanted to beat them at their crib."" But the game was still in doubt until Morant's poster-worthy dunk. The rookie said the bench was laughing in the aftermath, joking that it took him two months to finally finish a huge slam in a clutch moment. ""It felt good,"" Morant said. ""I feel like everybody knows that's my game. To go to the rack with force and try to finish the play aggressive and was able to get one tonight."" Frank Kaminsky III led the Suns with a season-high 24 points and Ricky Rubio tied a season-high with 22. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 14 points and 13 rebounds. Leading scorer Devin Booker had an off night with just 15 points on 6-of-17 shooting. ""I think we came in complacent thinking it was going to be easier than it was,"" Booker said. ""They came ready to play and credit them for playing hard, but we have to do better."" Phoenix scored the first 11 points of the game but Memphis responded quickly, going on a 25-6 run to take a 27-19 lead by the end of the first quarter. The teams were tied at 51 going into halftime. Kaminsky led the Suns with 15 points in the first half, shooting 6 of 7 from the field, including 3 of 3 from 3-point range. Brooks and Brandon Clarke -- who played high school basketball in Phoenix -- both had 13 for the Grizzlies before the break. BIG BENCH The Grizzlies' got a lot of production from bench players Clarke and De'Anthony Melton. The 6-foot-2 Melton had nine points, six rebounds and three assists and the Grizzlies outscored the Suns by 22 points during the 19 minutes he was on the floor. GOOD STARTS, NO FINISH Phoenix started the game on an 11-0 run, the second quarter on a 7-0 run and the third quarter on a 6-0 run. None of that mattered after the loss. ""That was fool's gold,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said of the initial 11-0 start. ""We just didn't have a defensive focus tonight."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Guard Grayson Allen didn't play because of right ankle soreness. ... Kyle Anderson (heel) played after missing five straight games. He played 12 minutes and finished with three points and four rebounds. ... The Grizzlies improved to 8-16 for the season. Suns: Starting center Deandre Ayton missed the 23rd of his 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's drug policy. He's eligible to return on Dec. 17 in a road game against the Los Angeles Clippers. ... The Suns fell to 11-13 for the season.","401161005"
"MILWAUKEE --  No Giannis was no problem for the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. Reigning league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo sat out but the Bucks kept on rolling, getting 29 points from Eric Bledsoe and 24 from Khris Middleton in a 127-112 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans that extended their winning streak to 16 games. The Bucks (22-3) tied the second-longest winning streak in franchise history and moved closer to the franchise record of 20 set during the team's 1970-71 championship season. Antetokounmpo sat out with a right quad tendon injury, missing his first game this season. ""I think we took a little more ownership of what's going on out there,"" Middleton said. ""When Giannis is out there, he draws such a huge crowd that we play through him a lot. Without him tonight, we know we have to do a little bit more. ""It was a great test; they play with a fast pace just like us. I think we did a great job."" Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova, starting in place of Antetokounmpo, had a season-high 18 points and nine rebounds. George Hill contributed 13 points off the bench. Bledsoe drove aggressively and scored 11 points in the third quarter to answer a Pelicans rally, and he finished making a season-high five 3-pointers and going 10 for 13 from the field while adding six assists. ""I try to get in the paint as much as possible,"" Bledsoe said. ""If I don't have a shot, I kick it out to my teammates and trust them to make the right play."" New Orleans (6-19) lost its 10th straight game despite a season-high 31 points from J.J. Redick. Brandon Ingram had 25 points and 10 rebounds and point guard Jrue Holiday added 21 points. A frustrated Redick spoke up in the locker room at halftime, when New Orleans trailed by 23 points. ""It's not like this is the first time we've had a talk at halftime,"" Redick said. ""I would say emotionally sometimes you reach a tipping point. That's the timing of that."" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said his team needs to communicate better. ""It's the quietest group I've ever been around, even on the plane and in the meal room,"" Gentry said. ""But we do have to get them talking on the court and have them communicate on the court. ""When we do, we're pretty solid. I thought we did a good job in the second half of communicating. But when you're trying to come back from 25 to-28-point deficits, the least little thing is going to have a glaring effect."" The Bucks hit six of their first eight attempts from 3-point range, including 3 of 3 by Bledsoe, to take a 28-12 lead. Milwaukee led by 23 points in the opening quarter before New Orleans closed the period on an 8-0 spurt to pull within 35-20. The Bucks used a 17-0 run to grab a 56-28 lead in the second quarter before settling for a 69-46 halftime margin. Middleton and Bledsoe each had 13 points and Ilyasova and Hill added 11 apiece. The Pelicans outscored the Bucks 40-36 in the third quarter. New Orleans pulled within 120-108 with 2:51 remaining but Middleton hit a pair of jumpers to put the Bucks safely ahead. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans was coming off a two-point home loss to Detroit on Monday and has struggled without No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson, who has missed the first 25 games of the season after undergoing surgery for a torn right lateral meniscus. ""You either win or you learn,"" Gentry said. ""I think the guys are still playing hard. We just have these moments, these stretches where we struggle some and go away from what we're doing."" Bucks: Milwaukee won for the 20th time in its last 21 games and improved to 12-1 at home. The only loss at the Fiserv Forum came in the home opener against Miami. ... The Bucks hit 19 of 39 attempts from 3-point range, one shy of their season high. MISSING GIANNIS Antetokounmpo did not participate in the team's shootaround on Wednesday morning and quickly was ruled out. ""I don't think we know exactly when it happened,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""This morning the soreness was such that he was not able to play tonight. The severity of it, we're hoping it's not too serious. ""We'll take it day by day and we're always going to err on the side of caution."" Ilyasova, the 6-foot-8 veteran, made his first start of the season and responded with 8-of-10 shooting while drawing two offensive fouls and showing his usual energy. ""Ersan is in a great place,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's making a lot of those feel plays, those rhythm plays. The offense is moving a little better recently and I think that suits Ersan. His ability to slip and roll in the pick-and-rolls and work behind the defense, he's just a really smart player.""","401161006"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Buddy Hield was upset about not getting a foul call when Oklahoma City double-teamed him in the final seconds while he was attempting to get free for a shot. When no whistle blew, Hield calmed down and passed the ball to Sacramento teammate Bogdan Bogdanovic. ""I found the best shooter in the gym, so its cool,"" Hield said. Bogdanovic made a 3-pointer with 13.4 seconds remaining and the Kings overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Thunder 94-93 on Wednesday night. It was the second time in three days Sacramento hit a late 3 to win. Nemanja Bjelica's 33-footer at the buzzer lifted the Kings over Houston 119-118 on Monday. They also got a clutch defensive stop from Cory Joseph to hold off the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. ""When you trust the guys you have on the court, sometimes at the end you have to sit back and let them do what they do,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""I enjoy those moments."" Both teams committed turnovers with the game tied in the final minute before Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hit two free throws to put the Thunder up 93-91 with 31.6 seconds left. That came 24 seconds after Oklahoma City failed to advance the ball past midcourt within the allotted eight seconds. We had some opportunities in the fourth to have better possessions offensively, Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. The possessions we had werent good enough. They made some shots that I thought we defended really well, but we didnt close the game as well as we had some other games. Bogdanovic, who missed five of his first six 3s, got the ball outside the arc and paused as Oklahoma City defender Dennis Schroder went flying past him trying for a block. Bogdanovic then hit a 28-foot jumper to give Sacramento the lead. Chris Paul missed a shot from the elbow for the Thunder as time expired. I watch all these games on League Pass night in and night out, and as soon as it left (Bogdanovics) hand you just know it's going in, Paul said. I got to the spot I wanted to. I have to knock that down. Hield had eight of his 23 points in the fourth quarter for the Kings. Bogdanovic scored 17 and Marvin Bagley III added 11 points and six rebounds after missing the previous 22 games with a broken right thumb. It was great, said Bagley, the second overall pick in the 2018 draft. Being back out there after that period of time rehabbing and making sure I was healthy enough to play, it felt good to be back out there playing a game that I love. Schroder had 17 points to lead six Thunder players in double figures. Paul wasnt one of them. Oklahoma Citys point guard had eight points, 12 assists and seven rebounds. The Thunder had won three straight. Sacramento trailed by 14 early in the third but made a late run and cut the gap to 71-69 following consecutive 3s by Hield, who had missed six of his first seven attempts from beyond the arc. TIP-INS Thunder: Schroders three 3-pointers in the first half matched that of the entire Sacramento team. Oklahoma City finished with 13 3s.  Steven Adams had 12 points and 11 rebounds. Kings: Bagleys first shot was an airball and he finished 5 of 13. He was injured in the first game of the season.  Hield missed nine of his first 11 shots.  Sacramento had only three assists in the first half and finished with 12.","401161007"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Warriors coach Steve Kerr liked the comeback attempt he saw Wednesday night from his young Golden State team. That sort of effort just isn't paying off in the win column. Marcus Morris scored a season-high 36 points and the New York Knicks held off Golden State 124-122 in overtime to snap a 10-game losing streak. Golden State (5-21) trailed by 21 in the second quarter but roared back with a second-half rally. The Warriors still lost for the sixth time in seven games and fell behind the Knicks (5-20) for the NBA's worst record. ""At halftime we were down 18, and we were sort of lifeless,"" Kerr said. ""We got back in the game pretty quickly in the third quarter. That's a good lesson for young players in this league. It's a really long game and you have to stay with it."" The Warriors returned from a five-game road trip with optimism, seeing a favorable stretch of schedule ahead that offered seemingly winnable games at home. Over the past three nights, however, they've dropped games to the Knicks and Memphis Grizzlies, who own a combined record of 13-36. Julius Randle had 24 points and 13 rebounds, and rookie RJ Barrett scored 22 for New York, which fought off the Warriors' comeback bid and gave Mike Miller his first win as interim coach. ""We had to bounce back again and again and again,"" Miller said. ""(The Warriors) continued to make plays, continued to stretch the game out. We had a lot of guys contribute and play well tonight."" The NBA's two worst teams staged an entertaining fourth quarter, with D'Angelo Russell hitting a 3-pointer for the Warriors to tie it at 112 with 3.9 seconds left and force overtime. New York controlled the extra period, with Randle's 3-pointer snapping a 114-all tie and putting the Knicks in front for good. Russell finished with 32 points to lead Golden State. The Knicks had their way inside in the first two quarters, shooting 58% and outscoring the Warriors in the paint 32-18. Morris had 18 points as the Knicks took a 68-50 lead into the break. Golden State's cold shooting from Monday's loss to Memphis carried over. Many of those misses came from close range, too, as the Warriors hit just 17 of their 51 shots (33%) in the first half. TIP-INS Knicks: Miller, three games into his tenure after David Fizdale was fired, said the front office hasn't given him any indication whether he'll be leading the team for the rest of the season. ""We're in constant communication. They've been really supportive. It's just been about getting to the next game. I'm fine with that,"" Miller said. Warriors: F Eric Paschall was listed as questionable Wedneday morning with a sore left hip, but he was in the starting lineup for the 19th time in Golden State's 26 games. He scored only five points in just under 17 minutes and was taken out as a precaution when his hip acted up, Kerr said. FILM SESSION Barrett, the No. 3 pick in the draft who has battled through a shooting slump, watched video of his recent play and turned things around Wednesday, going 8 for 16 from the floor and finishing with 22 points for New York. ""I'm just trying to play basketball,"" Barrett said. ""Make the right plays and just get my mojo back, really.""","401161008"
"BOSTON -- Joel Embiid answered the criticism from a couple of Hall of Famers in the most productive way possible. After Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley said Embiid wasn't playing up to his potential, the 76ers center conceded that they were probably right. Then he produced one of his best games of the season: a season-high 38 points along with 13 rebounds in a 115-109 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night. ""All of the stuff he has been dealing with he handled like an adult, with humility. And he responded in a dramatic way,'' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""He was dominant, was a leader and one of his best games as a Sixer.'' Embiid scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, hitting 5 of 6 free throws in the final 26 seconds after Boston scored seven straight points to erase most of a nine-point deficit. With Philadelphia leading by four in the final 15 seconds, he blocked Daniel Theis' shot to help clinch it. Earlier in the week, Barkley said Embiid is the toughest matchup in the league, but he doesn't take advantage of it. O'Neal said on the TNT broadcast that Embiid shouldn't settle for 22 points a game, his current average, but should aim for more like 28 or 30. ""I like when I get criticized,'' Embiid said after the game. ""For them to say I have the potential to be the best player in the world, and I haven't shown that yet, I need to play harder.'' Celtics center Enes Kanter said he approached Embiid during the game and told him not to worry about the criticism. ""He's one of the best big men in the league,'' said Kanter, who scored a season-high 20 points with nine rebounds. ""I told him, 'Hey, don't worry about it.' I told him to just go out and play your game.'' Tobias Harris had 23 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Sixers, who won their fourth consecutive game and their eighth in nine tries. Kemba Walker scored 29 points for Boston, which lost at home for the first time all season. Gordon Hayward scored 19. LATE RUNS After helping the Sixers hang around for three quarters, Embiid dragged them to a 106-97 lead with just over two minutes left. Walker hit three free throws, then Kanter scored on a tip-in and Hayward hit a fallaway jumper to make it 106-104 with 61 seconds left. It was 110-106 when Jayson Tatum made a rainbow 3-pointer over Embiid to make it a one-point game. But Embiid hit his foul shots, and then gave the 76ers a stop on defense to help them pull two games ahead of rival Boston in the Eastern Conference. ""In the fourth quarter, I haven't been the closer these guys have needed me to be this whole season,'' Embiid said. EARLY LEAD  Walker scored 12 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics opened an eight-point lead before Philadelphia scored eight in a row to tie it. Boston scored the final six points of the first and the first basket of the second to make it 36-28, but that lead didn't last, either. It was a three-point game at halftime, then back and forth in the third before the Sixers began to pull away in the fourth. TIP-INS Sixers: Former Celtic Al Horford sat out the game with left knee and hamstring injuries. He received a standing ovation when he was shown on the scoreboard, and he acknowledged the crowd with a wave. Horford spent three seasons with Boston before opting out of his contract and signing with Philadelphia as a free agent last summer. Celtics: Marcus Smart (eye) and Robert Williams (hip) both missed Wednesday's game at Indiana and both were unavailable against the 76ers. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  Cleveland veteran Kevin Love has struggled to find a bright spot during a gloomy season for the Cavaliers, so he created his own. Love hit a tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation and finished with 30 points and 17 rebounds as the Cavs rallied past the San Antonio Spurs 117-109 in overtime Thursday night to stop an eight-game losing streak. ""Hell, yeah,"" Love said when asked about the importance of having fun. ""I think that's what is lost sometimes. It's human nature to feel that way after the losses pile up or you fall on hard times, but I think it's a really long season. You have to find some bright spots and know at the end of the day that if you really love this game, there is going to be ups and downs."" Love had 10 points in the fourth quarter and OT to help Cleveland win for the first time since Nov. 23 against Portland. San Antonio played a third straight overtime game for the first time in franchise history. The Spurs won the previous two at home but failed to maintain a five-point lead with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter this time. DeMar DeRozan had 21 points but missed a pair of free throws with 14 seconds remaining in regulation and the Spurs leading 103-100. ""No excuse why I shouldn't have made those free throws,"" DeRozan said. ""That's just not acceptable on my part."" Love followed by tying the game at 103 on a 3 with 7.5 seconds to go. ""Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, right?"" Love said. ""It was a little bit of a broken play there. Got off a good pump fake. Could have shot it but felt that little pump fake was going to give me a little bit better look, which it did."" DeRozan missed a 20-foot fadeaway jumper at the close of regulation. The Cavaliers opened overtime on an 8-4 run, including back-to-back 3s by Love and Cedi Osman, to capture just their third road win of the season. ""It was a great celebration as a team and you could tell (from) the energy (at the close of regulation that) we were going to come out with the victory,"" guard Collin Sexton said. Sexton had 28 points and San Antonio native Jordan Clarkson added 25 for the Cavaliers (6-19). The duo shot 20 for 37 with only four turnovers. ""We just kept going to the action with both of them in the pick-and-roll and we were able to make some really good things happen,"" Love said. The Spurs outscored the Cavs 35-22 in the fourth period after trailing by 13 in the third. Consecutive layups by DeRozan put San Antonio up 84-83 with 6:23 remaining. It was the Spurs' first lead since Rudy Gay's 3-pointer put them ahead 7-6 with 8:19 left in the first quarter. Derrick White added 17 points and LaMarcus Aldridge had 12 for San Antonio (9-15). ""It's on all of us tonight,"" Aldridge said. ""We let a good opportunity slip away."" Cleveland lost four of its previous five games by 20-plus points but dominated for three quarters. The Cavaliers built a 10-point lead in the second while shooting 47% from the field. ""Cleveland played for 48, we played for 24,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""That's the bottom line."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Their previous victory against the Spurs was March 12, 2015, in San Antonio. ... Dylan Windler missed the game with a lower left leg stress reaction. Windler is the only injured player on the roster. Spurs: Assistant coach Tim Duncan missed the game due to illness. Fellow assistant Mitch Johnson took Duncan's spot on the front row of the bench alongside Popovich and assistants Becky Hammon and Will Hardy. . DeRozan was assessed a technical foul at the close of the first half for chucking the ball high over the backboard from the opposite lane. He appeared frustrated after the Cavaliers scored with 1.1 seconds left in the second quarter after rebounding a missed 3-pointer. WELCOME HOME Playing in his hometown has lost some of its luster for Clarkson, who is in his seventh NBA season. ""I don't have no emotion,"" Clarkson said. ""I'm free of mind. So, it's just like I just come out here and hoop and have fun. It's definitely a big moment for my family coming to see me play on this court. But for me, it's a game.""","401161010"
"MEXICO CITY --  Luka Doncics Spanish was flawless. His game was pretty good, too. Doncic scored 41 points and posted his eighth triple-double of the season, Seth Curry added a season-high 30 points off the bench and the Dallas Mavericks topped the Detroit Pistons 122-111 on Thursday night in the opener of the NBA Mexico Games. Doncic finished with 12 rebounds and 11 assists for the Mavericks, who at 17-7 are off to their best 24-game start since posting the same mark at this point of the 2014-15 season. He picked us apart,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Curry scored 18 points in the second quarter alone for Dallas. The Mavericks trailed by seven late in the first half, then went on a 14-0 run before intermission and eventually led by as many as 24. Curry became the first Dallas reserve to score 30 off the bench since Jason Terry had 34 against San Antonio on Jan. 29, 2012. Even when Detroit was playing zone, our guys were making an effort to drive-and-kick, drive-and-kick and find Seth ultimately for the shot,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. Real happy for him. He did everything. He drove it. He shot it. He made a couple good plays on the breaks. He made a couple good passes. He was a huge contributor tonight."" Doncics eight triple-doubles already match his total from last season. Kristaps Porzingis added 20 points for the Mavericks, who outrebounded Detroit 52-34. I think we're getting better and better every day,"" Doncic said. He's going to get better. I'm going to get better. And with us two, the team is going to get way better."" Andre Drummond led the Pistons with 23 points and 15 rebounds. Derrick Rose scored 19 points and Markieff Morris added 16 for Detroit, which got 12 from Tony Snell and 10 apiece from Christian Wood and Blake Griffin. Back to the drawing board,"" Casey said. Dallas is a great team. Rick's done a heck of a job with that team. But we missed a lot of shots that we normally make. And then defensively, I thought we missed a lot of rotations."" It was the 29th game in Mexico since 1992, the most of any country other than the U.S. or Canada in that span and came on a night where the NBA announced that Capitanes -- a Mexico City-based team in that countrys top pro league -- will be joining the G League starting next season. Playing out here was incredible,"" Drummond said. The atmosphere was outstanding."" Doncic addressed the Mexico City crowd pregame -- to their delight -- in flawless Spanish, before turning the microphone over to Griffin. Hola, Mexico, was the extent of Griffins Spanish offering, as he grinned and a very amused Doncic looked on standing a few feet away. The night didn't get much easier for Griffin from there: He shot just 3 for 16, and 1 for 10 from 3-point range. Doncic, meanwhile, went on to post his second 40-point triple-double of the season. Hes the first player in NBA history to have multiple 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21; he doesnt celebrate that birthday until Feb. 28. TIP-INS Mavericks: It was the third time Dallas played a regular-season game outside of the U.S. or Canada -- the Mavs played Houston in 1997-98 and Phoenix in 2016-17, both in Mexico City. ... NBA Commissioner Adam Silver misspoke before the game at a news conference, introducing deputy commissioner Mark Tatum as Mark Cuban -- the Mavs owner. Pistons: Before Thursday, Detroits only other regular-season game outside of the U.S. or Canada was Jan. 17, 2013 -- a loss to New York in London. ... This was only Detroits second chance at a three-game winning streak so far this season. The Pistons had won two straight before losing to Milwaukee on Dec. 4, and had won two straight again before Thursday. AVOCADO WOES Drummond was a game-time decision because the Pistons said he had an allergic reaction to an avocado. He had swelling around his eyes Wednesday, but played as planned. SECOND GAME San Antonio plays Phoenix in Mexico City on Saturday. Itll count as a home game for the Suns. This is the first time that the NBA has brought four teams to the Mexico games.","401161011"
"DENVER --  With his team well ahead in the final seconds, Nikola Jokic heaved a shot from the top of the key that swished through the net for a 3-pointer. It was that kind of night for the Denver Nuggets. Jokic and Jerami Grant scored 20 points apiece and Denver overcame a career-high 33 by Hassan Whiteside to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 114-99 on Thursday. Gary Harris and Will Barton each added 15 points for the Nuggets, who had lost five of their previous six games and failed to surpass 100 points in four of those losses -- with poor outside shooting a big factor. They were back on target against Portland, making twice as many 3-pointers (18 of 36) as the Trail Blazers (9 of 30). Grant accounted for five of them. ""The main thing is we were making shots and when we make shots, I think we can beat anybody,"" Jokic said. ""When we're scoring, we create open 3s and those are the best 3s."" Denver coach Michael Malone thought crisp ball movement was the key to generating open looks for his team. ""And I liked the fact that guys were stepping into their shot, shooting with confidence, being a lot more shot ready and playing in attack mode,"" Malone said. Carmelo Anthony, who spent the first 7 1/2 years of his career in Denver, received a warm reception from the crowd during pregame introductions. He had 20 points for Portland, and CJ McCollum added 15. Trailing by seven at halftime, Portland cut the deficit to one on Damian Lillard's 3-pointer late in the third quarter. But the Nuggets scored 10 straight points in the last 2:33 of the period, including two 3s by Grant, to rebuild their lead to 89-78 going into the fourth. Barton's 3-pointer with 9:43 remaining put the Nuggets up 96-80, their biggest lead to that point, and Denver maintained a double-digit advantage the rest of the way. ""They made 18 3s the first time we played them (in a preseason game) and they made 18 3s tonight. To me, that was the difference in the game,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Some of it was on us leaving shooters and not contesting as much, and some of it was on them because they moved the ball really well and found the open man."" The final margin was a departure from recent meetings. The previous seven regular-season encounters between the Nuggets and Trail Blazers had all been decided by single digits. Denver, which lost to Portland in the Western Conference semifinals last season, has won the first two matchups this season, including an opening-night victory at Portland that snapped its 18-game winning streak in home openers. Harris hit three 3-pointers in the first half, helping the Nuggets take a 62-53 lead. MEMORABLE MEETING During an early stretch, second-year Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. found himself defending Anthony, one of his childhood basketball inspirations. ""It was crazy,"" Porter said. ""When I first checked in, he was like, 'What's up young fella?' That was definitely cool for me. He was one of my favorite players growing up."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: C Jusuf Nurkic, working his way back from a broken left leg suffered last March, ran the stands at the Pepsi Center during the team's shootaround. Nurkic has been doing conditioning and shooting drills in recent weeks. The team hasn't given a timeline for his return, but Stotts said before the game, ""He is doing everything he is supposed to do behind the scenes."" Nuggets: Jamal Murray was back on the floor after leaving Tuesday night's game at Philadelphia in the opening minutes with what the team described as a ""trunk contusion"" following an on-court collision. Murray finished with 12 points.","401161012"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- James Harden found his 3-point shooting touch -- again. Harden scored 54 points -- matching the team record of 10 3-pointers he set in Houston's previous game -- in the Rockets' 130-107 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. ""I just want to win,"" Harden said simply. ""Whatever it takes."" Harden scored 50 or more for the fifth time this season and the fourth time in his past seven games. The rest of the NBA has combined for only five such games this season. Harden was 10-of-15 from long range and 19-of-31 overall from the field. He also had seven assists, five rebounds and two steals in 36 minutes, receiving a loud ovation from the Orlando crowd when he headed to the bench in the final minutes. ""I feel like we lost against just him tonight,"" Magic guard Evan Fournier said. ""He's the MVP for a reason. We talked about in pregame that he'll take shots, and we'll just live with the results. He did not miss tonight, period."" Harden set the Houston record for 3-pointers with 10 in 18 attempts Wednesday night in a 55-point game in a victory at Cleveland. ""When he's shooting over the top like that, I don't know what you can do,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Russell Westbrook added 23 points for Houston. The Rockets were 22-of-39 from 3-point range, setting a record for the most 3-pointers by any Magic opponent in franchise history. ""We just shot the ball extremely well,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""When James is like that, it's hard for anybody to really beat us -- no matter what kind of defense you're going to throw, we've got guys."" The Rockets pulled away in the second quarter, with Harden scoring 18 points, including Houston's last 11 for a 59-49 lead. Fournier led Orlando with 27 points. Aaron Gordon added 21. The Magic have lost three straight after winning four in a row. TIP-INS: Rockets: Beat the Magic for the 12th time in the past 15 meetings. ... Hold four of the top five spots for most made 3-pointers by a team this season. ... D'Antoni said he assumes his team will play Saturday without Westbrook, who sat out the second game of both of Houston's previous back-to-backs this season. Magic: Orlando was without C Nikola Vucevic for the 11th consecutive game because of a right ankle injury. ... G Markelle Fultz returned after missing Wednesday's game against the Los Angeles Lakers with a stomach virus. ... The Magic held their annual charity golf tournament Thursday to benefit the Orlando Magic Youth Foundation. More than $200,000 was raised.","401161013"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Tobias Harris seems to have found a comfort zone with his offensive game, providing another concern for opponents of the Philadelphia 76ers. Harris scored 31 points, Ben Simmons had 24 points and 11 assists, and the 76ers survived a late scare to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 116-109 on Friday night. Joel Embiid finished with 24 points and 11 rebounds in Philadelphia's fifth straight victory. It was also the 14th consecutive home victory for the 76ers, the franchise's longest streak to start a season since winning 22 straight home games in their NBA championship season in 1966-67. They are now the only undefeated team at home in the NBA after Miami dropped its first home game of the season on Friday night to the Los Angeles Lakers. One night after Embiid put up 38 points and 13 rebounds during a 115-109 win in Boston, it was Harris who became the main scoring threat by rolling outside and taking advantage of some double-teams that the Pelicans threw against Embiid. Harris shot 12 for 20 from the floor, many of them mid-range jumpers. ""I know that when I'm aggressive and getting things in the flow, I'm a very hard player to guard,"" said Harris, who has averaged 23.6 points in seven December contests. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said Harris has been steady. ""He has been so reliable and a go-to guy for us,"" Brown said. ""I put him in a bunch of different spots: pick-and-roll, isolation, 3-ball, and he plays the backdown game. He's having a hell of a year."" Harris was a trade deadline acquisition for the 76ers in February, but seemed to struggle at times fitting into the offensive attack when Jimmy Butler was around. There seems to be an added comfort level in his play this season after re-signing as a free agent in the summer. ""This is one of my best stretches as a player and since being here,"" Harris said. ""I feel like I'm in a good rhythm and balance here. I never want to come off the floor. I want to do what I can to help us win. Just being able to get familiar with guys on this team has helped and continues to increase. Being able to find ways to play with Ben and Joel in pockets of the game has been great. I understand more of what I need to do."" Brandon Ingram scored 32 points and J.J. Redick had 19 for the Pelicans, who have lost 11 in a row. ""We don't have any kind of margin of error,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We missed nine free throws at one point. We can't do that. We have to make those. And there's a couple of plays here and there. Our margin of error is not good enough that we can let those plays go by."" New Orleans briefly took a lead in the third quarter after trailing by as much as 16 in the first half. Philadelphia responded, however, with a 22-11 run to close out the quarter to swell the lead to 92-82 at the end of the period. TIP-INS Sixers: Al Horford missed his second straight game on Friday night with left knee soreness and left hamstring tightness. Horford, who sat out his first game back in Boston Thursday since departing as a free agent in the summer, is averaging 13.8 points and 6.8 rebounds. Horford was listed as day-to-day. Pelicans: Derrick Favors returned to the starting lineup. Favors missed time with a knee injury and following the death of his mother in late November. Favors had eight points and eight rebounds in 15 minutes. . Redick returned to Wells Fargo Center for the first time since signing as a free agent with New Orleans over the summer. Redick was Philadelphia's leading 3-point shooter during his two seasons, shooting 40.8 percent and averaging 17.6 points. A video tribute was played during a timeout in the first quarter and Redick received a standing ovation. . Zion Williamson, the top pick in the draft, missed his 22nd straight game with a right knee injury. There is no timeframe for Williamson's return. SLOPPY FINISH Philadelphia missed nine free throws in the final 3:17 to allow the Pelicans back in the game after trailing by as many as 13 earlier in the period. Embiid also fouled Jrue Holiday behind the 3-point arc with 21 seconds left. The former Sixers guard hit two of three from the line to cut Philadelphia's lead to 112-109. Those mistakes seemed to irritate Brett Brown. ""There are some good things that happened in that game and there are some poor things that happened in that game,"" Brown said. ""My mind is completely on what do we have to do to not be in that situation. Some of it is missing free throws -- a lot of free throws. And we had poor fouls. We fouled them too much when it mattered most in the last three minutes.""","401161014"
"ATLANTA --  Malcolm Brogdon wasn't about to let Trae Young score at will, not after the Indiana Pacers almost lost to the Hawks and their star point guard two weeks ago. ""He's a great shooter, a great player,"" Brogdon said. ""He has the ball in hands the whole game, so you have to be alert the whole time you're out there."" Brogdon had 19 points and 12 assists, Domantas Sabonis had 12 points and 14 rebounds, and the Pacers beat Atlanta 110-100 on Friday night. T.J. Warren scored 18 points as all five Indiana starters finished in double figures. Sabonis, who began the game second in the NBA in double-doubles, has reached the marks in 11 straight games and 21 overall. The Pacers improved to 5-2 this month and 17-9 overall. They are eight games over .500 for the first time this season. Young had 23 points, but missed 21 of 30 shots from the field, as Atlanta lost for the 14th time in 16 games. DeAndre Hunter scored 21 and Jabari Parker 20 for the Hawks. Young finished with 49 points in Indiana's one-point overtime win over Atlanta on Nov. 29, but this time Brogdon helped limit Young in the first half and teamed with reserve point guard Aaron Holiday to stymie him in the second. ""It's a good parallel, me and Aaron,"" Brogdon said. ""I'm a big guard. I can provide the length and bother him with my size. He's a smaller guard who get into him and stay in front of him. He can really harass him."" Atlanta, which dropped to 6-20, began the game ranked last in 3-point accuracy and missed its first 14 attempts beyond the arc. The Hawks finished 6 for 28 on treys with Young missing 10 of 13. ""For me, trying to be one of the closers, I have to be better,"" Young said. ""I was getting wide-open looks and missing. I felt like I let my team down tonight."" Brogdon drove the lane and converted with his right hand against Young to make it 108-100 with 1:09 remaining and hit a pair of free throws to end the scoring with 27.9 seconds left. He was the catalyst on offense. Indiana was coming off a 122-117 home win two nights ago over Boston, its best performance of the season as it beat an opponent that was 17-5 and had won four in a row. Holiday's layup put the Pacers back up by double-digits with 6:55 remaining, but Young answered with a 3 before Hunter's two free throws made it a five-point game. Sabonis, though, followed with a tip-in and then scored close to the rim with a left-hander to make it 101-94 with 4:56 remaining. The Pacers' lead swelled to 18 early in the third, but the Hawks quickly pulled within nine on Parker's fast-break dunk. Cam Reddish's 3 from the left corner trimmed the lead to 81-76 late in the period before Holiday hit a straightaway 3 and T.J. McConnell's 12-footer gave the Pacers an eight-point advantage. Allen Crabbe's 3 from the left wing pulled Atlanta within three entering the fourth. Turner's three-point play put the Pacers up by 17 late in the first half. Indiana let the Hawks score 35 in the third quarter but limited them to 17 in the fourth. ""We want to play draw-and-kick and if they're not stopping us, get to the rim or get to the free throw line,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. SERIES Indiana has won seven straight against the Hawks and 11 of the last 12. The Pacers won 105-104 in overtime at home two weeks ago, rallying from an 11-point halftime deficit and Young's 49 points. TIP-INS Pacers: G Doug McDermott scored 16 points in 29 minutes off the bench. ... G Jeremy Lamb, a starter, had 11 points and has finished in double figures in all but one game this season. ...

"MIAMI --  LeBron James compared the game to a heavyweight fight. If so, then the final punch was thrown by the Miami Heat -- and it missed. Anthony Davis scored 33 points, James had 28 while coming within a rebound of a triple-double and the Los Angeles Lakers held off the Heat 113-110 on Friday night. ""Two teams that are playing extremely well right now in this part of the season,"" James said. ""Two teams that play physical, play together, play hard. That's why they are where they are at this point in the season and that's why we are where we are."" James had 12 assists and nine rebounds and Davis grabbed 10 rebounds. The Lakers improved to 23-3 and remained tied with Milwaukee for the NBA's best record. They also extended the second-longest road winning streak in franchise history to 13 games and rallied from a double-digit deficit to win for the eighth time already this season. It wasn't over until the very last second -- Jimmy Butler knocked over James on his way to getting free enough to take the last shot, but his 3-pointer over Davis' outstretched arm bounced off the rim. ""It's always great to go against a great competitor in our league,"" James said about Butler. Including playoffs, they've squared off 34 times -- going 17-17. Butler led Miami with 23 points, Derrick Jones Jr. had 17, Kendrick Nunn added 16 and Kelly Olynyk had 15 . Bam Adebayo had 12 points and 12 rebounds for Miami, which had been 11-0 at home. ""All things being equal, these are two really good teams playing back and forth,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We were able to create some separation in the first half, and then in the third quarter they were able to impose their will."" The Lakers outrebounded Miami 50-34, and the last of those was the biggest. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a free throw with 8 seconds left to keep the Heat within two, but Miami couldn't get the rebound. Caldwell-Pope went back to the line with 4.2 seconds left, made one of two again and the Lakers' lead was pushed to three. Butler took the last shot for Miami, a 3-pointer with about a second left. It hit the rim and bounced off, the Heat argued that he was fouled to no avail, and the Lakers survived in James' lone trip this season to the city where he won championships in 2012 and 2013. ""We were able to get that stop,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. The Lakers were down by as many as 14 in the first half. James connected on a deep 3-pointer with 8:21 left in the third to tie the game at 65-65, spinning halfway around afterward and punching himself in the chest with both fists as the Heat called time -- after what had been a 10-point lead a mere 3:05 earlier was gone in a flash. Davis hit a 3 on the next possession to put the Lakers on top, JaVale McGee threw down an alley-oop lob from James while getting fouled a few seconds later to push the lead to 71-65, and Los Angeles was suddenly in control. The Lakers' lead got as big as 11 later in the third -- a 21-point turnaround from earlier in the quarter -- before Miami clawed back within three going into the fourth. But the Lakers held the lead the rest of the way. TIP-INS Lakers: When Miami's Chris Silva made a pair of free throws with 4:02 left in the first half, the Lakers trailed 51-41 -- the team's first double-digit deficit on the road in their last 3 hours, 43 minutes and 33 seconds of play. ... James improved to 6-13 at Miami as a visitor. He went 163-35 in home games with the Heat. Heat: Celebrities at the matchup included Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez -- both with personalized Heat ""Vice"" jerseys -- along with Heat legend Chris Bosh, Gucci Mane and DJ Khaled. ... Not only had Miami been 11-0 at home, but the Heat also were 13-1 when leading at halftime and 14-1 in games where they had led by more than 10 points. SPO VS. VOGEL It was the 50th time, including playoffs, that Spoelstra and Vogel went head-to-head -- the majority of those coming in the four-year span where James was in Miami and Indiana was an annual postseason problem. ""It's always a chess match,"" Vogel said. Spoelstra leads the head-to-head, 26-24. GOING HOME James is headed to Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday for a high school game like no other. It pits his alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Mary's of Akron, against Sierra Canyon -- the team featuring, among others, his son Bronny and Dwyane Wade's son Zaire. James said he won't be conflicted. ""I'll be cheering for my son,"" James said.","401161016"
"CHICAGO --  The Charlotte Hornets werent sharp offensively, yet a couple of timely scoring bursts and solid defense helped them to win again. Devonte Graham scored 16 points, Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington each had 13 and the Hornets bounced back after squandering an early 15-point lead, beating the Chicago Bulls 83-73 on Friday night for their third straight victory. The term we keep using is resiliency, Charlotte coach James Borrego said. These guys, we just keep bouncing back. We don't hang our heads. We just keep playing."" The Hornets bounced back twice in this one. After the Bulls rallied with 15 straight points to tie it at 44-all early in the third quarter, Charlotte responded with eight straight. Charlotte led 59-50 after a sloppy third quarter, but Kris Dunns jumper with 5:25 left in the fourth cut Charlottes lead to 66-64. Then, Terry Rozier and Graham hit back-to-back 3s to give the Hornets some breathing room and they held on. It was the lowest offensive output of the season for both teams. Charlottes previous low was 87 points against Boston on Nov. 7. Chicagos low was 84 against Toronto on Oct. 26. The Bulls point total was the lowest in the NBA this season. Charlotte shot 38% from the floor, but the Bulls were even worse at 30% in a choppy game between sub-.500 teams. Bismack Biyombo had 12 points for the Hornets. The Hornets outrebounded the Bulls 60-45, including 49 defensive boards to 34 for Chicago. ""We had probably one of our best rebounding games, Biyombo said. And defensively, we were playing attention to detail. So, overall, it was a great game for us."" Zach LaVine and Ryan Arcidiacono each had 12 points, Thaddeus Young and Lauri Markkanen added 10 apiece as Chicago lost for the fourth time in five games. It seemed like an 80s game, we just couldnt score LaVine said. We didnt let our bad offense affect our defense. That was one thing Bulls coach Jim Boylen said he liked after his team hit only 27 of 90 shots from the floor. Our defense was so good even though we were in transition 63 times, Boylen said. Think about it, 63 missed and our defense was still was where it was at. I am proud of that part of it. Charlotte led 24-15 after the first quarter as Biyombo scored eight points. The Hornets shot 40% in the period, and the Bulls missed on their first seven attempts from the floor, shooting only 28% for the quarter and allowing Charlotte to establish control early. The Hornets picked up the pace in the second quarter and opened a 15-point lead at 44-29 on Roziers finger-roll layup with 2:53 left. But the Bulls reeled off 11 straight points to close to 44-40 at the half. LaVine scored eight points in the quarter, including a running dunk with 27.3 seconds left. Markkanen hit a 3-pointer 14 seconds into the third and Dunn sank a free throw 39 seconds later to extend Chicagos run to 15-0 for a tie at 44-all. Charlotte then countered with eight straight points to restore its lead at 52-44. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum sat out his second game (left hand injury discomfort) and Marvin Williams missed his fourth for right knee soreness.

Bulls: Young entered averaging 21.6 minutes and nine points, his lowest numbers in both categories since his rookie season of 2007-08 with Philadelphia. He played 26:33 in this one. The 31-year-old forward signed a three-year, $41 million deal with Chicago in July after three seasons with Indiana, where he averaged 30.7 minutes last season. LEADING AGAIN Graham led all scorers for a second straight game, but it was quite a drop from his career-high 40 on Wednesday at Brooklyn when the Hornets rallied from a 20-point deficit to beat the Nets 113-108. SITTING OUT While Young got more time and points in this one, Markkanen played 25 minutes, 34 seconds and sat nearly 15 minutes in the second half. The 22-year-old Finn entered playing an average of 29.9 minutes.","401161017"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  After sitting out Milwaukees previous game with right quad tendon soreness, Giannis Antetokounmpo had plenty of energy to lead a fourth-quarter burst that kept the Bucks winning streak alive. Antetokounmpo scored 17 of his 37 points in the final period to help Milwaukee pull away for its 17th straight victory, 127-114 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks outscore Memphis 37-19 in the fourth to pull away. I thought he was fabulous, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said of the leagues reigning MVP. He makes at least one, maybe two 3s, finishing at the basket, and defensively, I think he is doing good things. So, he was just outstanding in the fourth quarter. The Bucks overcame Jaren Jackson Jr.s career-high 43 points. He scored 26 in the third quarter, converting 7 of 11 3-pointers in the third alone, to give Memphis a 95-90 lead heading into the fourth. There hasnt been anything like that, Jackson said of his third-quarter offense, because everything for a minute was going in for me. I felt just like a crazy rhythm and the basket got bigger."" But the Grizzlies couldnt hold on as Antetokounmpo almost outscored Memphis in the fourth on his own. The Bucks improved to 23-3, keeping pace with the Los Angeles Lakers for the best in the league. The Bucks have not lost since Nov. 8 at Utah. We were able to keep our composure, stay together, play together and execute on offense, defend even harder, said Antetokounmpo, who missed his first game of the season Wednesday night against New Orleans. It says a lot about this team. It says a lot about how good this team can be, and how good this team is. Khris Middleton added 26 points for the Bucks, while Eric Bledsoe finished with 12 before leaving in the third quarter with an injury. The 17-game winning streak is second-longest in franchise history, trailing only a 20-game run in the 1970-71 season. Dillon Brooks had 19 points for Memphis, while Jae Crowder had 15 points. Memphis played without star rookie Ja Morant, who took the night off for injury maintenance on a balky back. It took a heck of a fourth quarter from the Bucks to come away with the victory, said Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins, a member of the Bucks staff before taking over the Grizzlies this season. TIP-INS Bucks: Bledsoe left with a right shin contusion.  Antetokounmpo has reached double figures in all 25 games hes played and has 23 double-doubles. ... D.J. Wilson had 11 points, shooting 5 for 7.  Brook Lopez had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Grizzlies: Jacksons 26-point third quarter was a franchise record. The previous mark of 22 points was shared by Troy Daniels and Greg Anthony.  Rookie Brandon Clarke also was out because of a left oblique injury. Clarke ranks fifth in the league  and first among rookies -- in field goal percentage at 63.8%  Jackson has made at least two 3-pointers in seven straight games. He also recorded a block on the night running his string to nine straight game with at least one 3-pointer and one block. SPEAKING FOR JENKINS Jenkins naturally got a clear endorsement from Budenholzer in the Memphis coachs first season. I couldnt be more excited for Taylor, Budenholzer said before the game. I am missing him terribly.  Hes incredibly talented and incredibly gifted. Hopefully, through all of his experiences, he is prepared. But the game also was like watching mirror images of the two teams. We knew what they were doing, and they knew what we were doing, but it is so hard to stop, Antetokounmpo said. They were running our play -- actually their plays -- but it was the same as our plays.  Its fun playing against (Jenkins). FEELING IT Jackson made seven of his first nine attempts behind the arc in the third. As shots started falling in the third quarter, Jackson seemed to go into heat-check, converting shots deeper and deeper on the floor. One from straight away even banked in. That was when Jackson realized he was having a big game. The banker was just like Thank you for the backboard being there because otherwise, I wouldve airballed it. That one was cool.","401161018"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  It's hard to stop Paul George. It's hard to stop Kawhi Leonard. It's really hard to stop both at the same time. George and Leonard showed what the Los Angeles Clippers had in mind when they teamed up the superstar duo Friday night. George scored 46 points, Kawhi Leonard had 42 and the Clippers held on to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-117 for their fourth consecutive victory. ""It's special, two guys offensively,"" George said. ""The thing about it is, we're dishing, finding each other, feeding each other. And then when we have moments to be aggressive, we're looking to get aggressive, attack, look for our shots. It's great when both guys can get it going"" Leonard and George became the first set of teammates in Clippers' history to each score 40 points. It was the 21st time in NBA history it has happened. The last time it was done, it also involved George. He and Russell Westbrook did it for Oklahoma City last season. Leonard and George's previous high this season came Dec. 1, when they combined for 65 points against Washington. ""It's great that we can have somebody else out there to help scoring the ball, making the game easier for myself,"" Leonard said. ""We're still trying to build our chemistry out there."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 39 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota, which lost its seventh in a row. Towns had 14 points, including a 4-point play, in a 22-6 fourth-quarter run that trimmed a 21-point Los Angeles lead to five. Andrew Wiggins added 34 points for the Timberwolves. His basket with 1:04 left cut the Clippers' lead to 119-115. Minnesota didn't get closer than four the rest of the way. ""Disappointed from the loss, but we fought back,"" Wiggins said. ""We were down big. Dug ourselves a hole. We fought back though. We went out swinging."" Leonard and George set the tone early, combining to score the first 23 points for a Clippers team playing without Lou Williams, who sat out with a calf injury. In his absence, George and Leonard accounted for 54 of Los Angeles' 65 first-half points. They became the first duo to each score 35 or more points through the first three quarters of a game in the past 20 seasons, according to ESPN Stats and Info. Leonard made a career-high 19 free throws. He was 19 for 19 from the line. ""That was great,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We knew without Lou tonight, every play was basically for those two guys. And they came up big."" The Timberwolves took a 51-50 lead in the second quarter with a 15-2 run, capped by a Towns 3-pointer. Leonard responded with seven consecutive points to give the Clippers the lead for good. George started the third quarter with a 7-0 run of his own. He scored 16 in the third, when Los Angeles took control by outscoring Minnesota 37-23. ""Forty-six and forty-two, they make it very tough on you,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. Leonard's 31 first-half points set a career high for points in a half. He tied a career high for points in a first quarter with 16. ""We got into our spots early, made shots,"" Leonard said. ""Paul carried us in that second half."" Montrezl Harrell scored 18 points for the Clippers. Jeff Teague scored 22 for the Timberwolves. TIP-INS Clippers: Guards Patrick Beverley (concussion) and Landry Shamet (high ankle sprain) also did not play. Shamet missed his 16th consecutive game. Only four Clippers scored in the first half: Leonard, George, Harrell and Patrick Patterson. Timberwolves: Forward Jake Layman missed his 11th consecutive game with a left toe sprain. Forward Keita Bates-Diop returned to the rotation after missing Wednesday's loss to Utah with flu-like symptoms. All 10 of Robert Covington's points came in the second quarter. OLD FRIENDS Assistant coach Sam Cassell and Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders were assistant coaches on the Washington staff from 2009-14. Cassell also played two seasons for the Timberwolves from 2003-05 when Saunders' father, Flip, was the coach. ""I can go on and on about how good of a person he is,"" Ryan Saunders said.","401161019"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Nearly eight weeks into the season, the New York Knicks finally have back-to-back wins. They did it after falling behind by 16 points, too, 48 hours after taking Golden State to overtime and winning. Elfrid Payton had seven of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, Marcus Morris scored off an offensive rebound with 9.1 seconds left and the Knicks rallied to beat the Sacramento Kings 103-101 on Friday night. ""It's a good feeling,"" forward Julius Randle said. ""We just turned up our intensity and our aggressiveness. The bench did a great job coming in and playing well. We just kept fighting, locked into the details, and came out with a win."" Julius Randle had 24 points and nine rebounds, Mitchell Robinson added 14 points and nine boards, and Damyean Dotson scored 11 points. The Knicks (6-20) hadn't won consecutive games since beating Washington and Chicago in April in their 80th and 81st games last season. This season, victories have been hard enough to come by, let alone stacking them back-to-back. ""We were in positions where we bent a few times but we didn't break,"" New York interim coach Mike Miller said. ""Terrific effort, so many good performances, and showing character to keep coming back when you get down."" Two nights after beating Golden State 124-122 in overtime to snap a 10-game losing streak, the Knicks fell behind 77-61 in the third quarter. New York closed within 80-72 entering the fourth then got on roll behind Payton. Payton made a 4-footer to give the Knicks a 95-93 lead. After Buddy Hield tied it with a long jumper, Payton responded with a 20-foot jumper to put New York ahead for good. Cory Joseph missed a tying 3-pointer for the Kings, and Morris tipped in a miss by RJ Barrett. ""We started locking into detail and then we started getting some stops,"" Payton said. ""We all were out there making plays. Everybody was rolling."" Hield scored 34 points and had a career-high 11 rebounds for Sacramento. Harrison Barnes had 18 points and Nemanja Bjelica added 12 points and seven assists. The Kings had won their previous three. ""We've had some nice emotional wins lately, and in the past that has caused us to have a letdown,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""We built up a nice lead and we didn't maintain it. We fell off. The Knicks imposed their will on us."" The Kings' top 3-point threat, Hield made nine of his first 10 shots and had a pair of dunks on offensive rebounds in the first half. After New York trimmed a 15-point deficit to 52-45, Hield threw a lob pass to Richaun Holmes for a dunk that put Sacramento up by nine at halftime. TIP-INS Knicks: New York had lost four straight against Sacramento. . The Knicks went on an 11-2 run to close the third quarter. . Dotson made a 3-pointer from 33 feet away with the shot clock running down early in the fourth. . Dennis Smith Jr. (illness) was cleared to play but was held out because of coach's decision. Kings: Hield has 10 games this season with five or more 3s. WRONG BUCKET Knicks reserve Kevin Knox was going for a defensive rebound following a miss by Marvin Bagley in the second quarter when it looked like he dunked the ball back in the basket. Replays appeared to show Knox's hand on top of the ball before it went in, although Hield was credited with the points.","401161020"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Golden State worried so much about defending Donovan Mitchell that Bojan Bogdanovic repeatedly found himself wide open on the perimeter. That turned out to be just what the Utah forward needed to overcome a recent shooting slump. Bogdanovic made a go-ahead basket in the final two minutes, hit eight three pointers and scored 32 points to help the Jazz beat the Golden State Warriors 114-106 on Friday night. Mitchell added 28 to help Utah win for the third time in four games. While going 8 for 13 from 3-point range, Bogdanovic encountered token resistance much of the time. ""They were more scared of Donovan than my 3s,"" he said. ""That was their game plan."" Getting in the win column proved tougher than expected. Utah did not take the lead for good until Bogdanovic and Mitchell hit back-to-back 3-pointers with 1:18 remaining that gave the Jazz a 109-104 lead. Bogdanovic shot 61.5% from 3-point range and went 8 of 18 overall after shooting under 40% from the field in five of his last six games. That slump is a memory now. ""He's a big part of our offense,"" Mitchell said. ""He's confident shooting the ball. I told him, 'You can go 1 for 26. No one cares. Just shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot.' And that's what he did."" Rudy Gobert added 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz. Joe Ingles chipped in 13 points and eight assists, and Royce O'Neale added 14 points. Alec Burks scored 24 points and Damion Lee added 21 for the Warriors. D'Angelo Russell added 18 points. Golden State lost despite outscoring Utah 52-12 in bench points. Still, the Warriors showed enough promise to make head coach Steve Kerr believe they are turning a corner. ""So, I like where we're heading. I really do,"" Kerr said. ""I know that may sound crazy, because of our record, but I think we're going to start winning some games. I think we're getting better."" Golden State got a big lift from its bench starting in the waning minutes of the first quarter. The Warriors held Utah without a basket over the final four minutes of the quarter. That opened the door for a 9-0 run, capped by a step-back jumper from Russell just a few seconds into the second quarter that gave Golden State a 31-22 lead. Golden State totaled eight offensive rebounds in the first quarter while holding Utah to seven total rebounds. ""The offensive rebounds really hurt us in the first half,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Those were additional possessions. Golden State makes you expend a lot of energy in the half court guarding them and then they go to the boards."" The Warriors led by as many as 13 points during the second quarter. O'Neale buried a 3-pointer and threw down a dunk to help the Jazz trim the deficit to 41-37. Golden State countered with a 9-0 run, scoring baskets on four straight possessions. Burks punctuated the run with a jumper that gave the Warriors a 50-37 lead. Utah came alive in the third quarter behind the perimeter shooting of Bogdanovic. He buried back-to-back 3-pointers to fuel a 14-4 run that gave the Jazz a 76-68 lead. ""Our energy was completely different in the third quarter,"" Bogdanovic said. Golden State went ahead once again early in the fourth quarter when Russell started a 7-0 run with a 3-pointer that put the Warriors up 91-88. FEELING AT HOME Burks was a standout once again on a return trip to Salt Lake City. He averaged 22.0 points on 50% shooting over two road games against the Jazz. The Warriors guard spent eight seasons in Utah, appearing in 382 games and averaging 9.6 points. Some of Burks' ex-teammates remain on the roster and that familiarity has bred success for him in a normally tough road venue. ""In eight years here, I scored on every one of them, more than a few times,"" Burks said with a laugh. ""It's always fun to play against those guys."" BATTLING FOR BOARDS Golden State finished with a 48-43 rebound advantage against Utah. The Jazz came away feeling good about it after recovering from a sluggish start on the glass. The Warriors outrebounded Utah 26-16 in the first half. The Jazz picked it up in the second half and edged Golden State 27-22 on the boards. They limited the Warriors to four offensive boards after halftime. ""We could have easily said 'Here we go again' down at home to a team we should beat,"" Mitchell said. ""For us to be resilient and continue to fight just shows the progress we've made."" TIP INS Warriors: Draymond Green (rest) and Eric Paschall (left hip soreness) did not play. . Marquese Chriss matched his career-high with 13 rebounds. Chriss also scored 12 points. ... Golden State totaled eight offensive rebounds in the first quarter while holding Utah to seven total rebounds. Jazz: Mike Conley (left hamstring tightness) and Tony Bradley (illness) were inactive. Conley missed his fifth straight game. . Ingles has dished out at least eight assists in four of the last six games. . Utah outscored Golden State 11-4 in fast break points.","401161021"
"MEXICO CITY --  San Antonio set a record. Patty Milly got the Spurs a win, too. Mills made a jumper from the free throw line with 0.3 seconds left in the Spurs' record-setting fourth consecutive overtime game, and they outlasted the Phoenix Suns 121-119 on Saturday. The NBA record book shows 20 instances of teams playing three straight overtime games -- but never four straight, like the Spurs have. They're 3-1 in those games, their best stretch since opening the season 4-1. ""We've had four overtime games in a row now and we've won three of them and I think there's something positive to be said for that,"" Mills said. ""Tonight it was the execution. We haven't had the greatest of seasons but we're learning as we go."" DeMar DeRozan pulled the Spurs even with a drive and fling -- after a foul by Mikal Bridges -- down the right side of the lane, but missed the free throw. The ball went out of bounds on a scramble after the missed free throw, and San Antonio kept the ball after a replay review. Phoenix, with star guard Devin Booker sitting out because of a sore forearm, overcame a late seven-point deficit to force overtime on Kelly Oubre Jr's 3-pointer from the corner in the final seconds. Mills led the Spurs with 26 points. ""If it doesn't go in, then it doesn't work,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said about Mills' winner. ""This one happened to go in."" DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge and Dejounte Murray each added 18 for San Antonio, and Lonnie Walker IV had 16 on his 21st birthday. Ricky Rubio had 25 points and 13 assists for Phoenix. Frank Kaminsky added 22, and Oubre had 17. ""With Devin out, we knew Ricky was going to have to have a big game,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""And he just kept making play after play after play. ... But as a young team, Ricky's a guy that we rely on in a lot of situations."" MORE GAMES IN MEXICO Saturday was the 30th game -- 10th of the regular-season variety -- that the NBA has held in Mexico, and Commissioner Adam Silver said more are being planned. The Mexico City-based Capitanes team will join the G League next year, and Silver said that move may mean the NBA pivots back to bringing preseason games to Mexico going forward. ""If we bring preseason games, which we have in the past, we can work in conjunction with our G League affiliate, work to grow the game and spend more time in the community,"" Silver said. Besides the two regular-season games -- Dallas beat Detroit on Thursday night -- and the G League announcement, the NBA also opened Mexico's first NBA Store on this trip. The 2,000-square-foot space opened in Mexico City's upscale Polanco neighborhood. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio has been below the .500 mark for more days this season than it has been in the previous 10 seasons combined; 32 and counting this season, 28 in the previous decade. The Spurs will soon spend their 100th day with a losing record over the last 22 years -- amazingly, every other team in the NBA has spent at least 1,000 days below .500 in that span. Suns: This was the next-to-last game in Deandre Ayton's 25-game suspension without pay after testing positive for a diuretic. He can return Tuesday night when Phoenix visits the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Phoenix has played 20 times outside the U.S. or Canada, with the majority of those appearances coming in either Mexico or Italy. The Suns have played in those nations six times each. GLOBAL POP Mexico becomes the fifth country in which Popovich has coached a game in 2019. The list: the U.S., Canada (San Antonio played at Toronto on Feb. 22), Australia (USA Basketball played three games there in August before the World Cup), China (where the U.S. finished seventh at the World Cup), and now Mexico. He'll add Japan to the list next year during the Tokyo Olympics. HELLO, AGAIN Williams played for Popovich in San Antonio, began his coaching career with the Spurs as an intern in 2004-05 -- a title year for the silver and black -- and had been a vice president of basketball operations in San Antonio from 2016 through 2018. Phoenix's next game is a reunion of sorts for Williams as well; the Suns play Monday night against Portland, the team that gave him his first assistant coaching position in 2005.","401161022"
"TORONTO --  One huge quarter from 3-point range helped the Toronto Raptors halt a rare home losing streak. Pascal Siakam scored 30 points, Marc Gasol set season highs with 17 points and 15 rebounds and the Raptors beat the Brooklyn Nets 110-102 on Saturday night to snap a three-game slump on their home court. ""Our overall feel-good was there tonight,"" Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. Norman Powell fouled out with 25 points and Lowry had 17 to help the Raptors win their ninth straight home game against the Nets and beat Brooklyn for the 16th time in 17 meetings. ""I really think tonight's game was fuelled by the defense we had,"" Powell said. Serge Ibaka had 12 points and 12 rebounds as Toronto extended an NBA record by winning its 34th straight at home against a division foe. The Raptors are unbeaten at home against Atlantic Division opponents since a Nov. 10, 2015, loss to the New York Knicks. The Raptors made nine of 12 attempts from 3-point range in the first quarter, including their first seven straight. ""It gave us some good energy to start to shoot the ball so well,"" coach Nick Nurse said. The hot shooting didn't last, and Toronto went 5 for 28 from distance the rest of the way. ""We've just got to keep shooting, keep getting shots up and playing aggressive,"" Lowry said. Toronto came in having made 27.2% of its 3-point attempts in its previous five games, four of them losses. The Raptors made a season-low seven 3-pointers Monday night in a 93-92 win at Chicago. Wednesday's loss to former teammate Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers was Toronto's third straight at home after a franchise-record nine consecutive home wins to begin the season. The Raptors hadn't lost three straight at home since Nov. 29 to Dec. 5, 2015. Siakam topped 25 points Saturday for the first time in six games. Toronto lost four of the five games in which Siakam failed to score at least 25. ""Our energy was where we want it to be,"" Siakam said. ""We made a lot of mistakes but we covered it up with our energy."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 26 points, Garrett Temple added 16 and Taurean Prince had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who are 0-4 on the road against opponents with winning records. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said sloppy ball handling and poor outside shooting was too much to overcome against the defending NBA champions. Brooklyn shot 12 for 46 from long range, with Temple missing 12 of 14 attempts. The Nets also made 20 turnovers, leading to 29 points for the Raptors. ""When you have 20 turnovers and then you miss the amount of shots we did, it's just not good enough,"" Atkinson said. Temple couldn't convert a three-point play after making a layup to begin the fourth, and Powell scored five points as Toronto replied with a 9-0 run, taking a 99-85 lead with 8:32 left to play. Nine of Toronto's 12 field goals in the first were 3-pointers, one shy of the team record for a single quarter. Siakam had 14 points in the first as the Raptors overcame an early 12-2 deficit to lead 38-31 after one. ""Credit to them being locked in from the jump,"" Prince said. TIP-INS Nets: Jarrett Allen had 10 rebounds, extending his career-best streak of 10-plus rebound games to 10. It's the longest streak by a Nets player since Reggie Evans did it in 18 straight in 2012-13. . Brooklyn's 59 rebounds were a season-high. . The Nets are 3-7 against opponents with winning records. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (right knee) missed his third straight game. . Gasol had a career-high 17 rebounds against Charlotte last Jan. 23. SHORT REST The Nets play again in less than 24 hours, hosting Philadelphia at 6 p.m. on Sunday. ""It's part of the job,"" Allen said. ""We've been built to play basketball. We condition our bodies to be able to do this and let's just go play tomorrow."" DOUBLY DISAPPOINTING Brooklyn, which led by 10 points early, couldn't hold a double-digit lead for the second straight game. The Nets saw a 20-point lead slip away in Wednesday's 113-108 home loss to Charlotte. REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVING With his 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's drug program complete, the Nets will have Wilson Chandler active for the first time Sunday. Prince said the veteran forward will provide defensive toughness and 3-point shooting. ""He makes good decisions on offense, doesn't really step outside of his game,"" Prince said.","401161023"
"CHICAGO --  After blowing several late leads to lose games, the Chicago Bulls were able to flip the script Saturday night. Zach LaVine scored 31 points and converted a decisive three-point play in the Bulls' 109-106 victory over the short-handed and weary Los Angeles Clippers. Chicago trailed by five points with less than two minutes to go. Tied at 106, the Bulls inbounded with 5.4 seconds left. LaVine got the ball near the 3-point line, drove to his right and was fouled by Montrezl Harrell as he scored with 2 seconds left. Paul George then missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""We made big plays,"" LaVine said. ""I think that's what it comes down to, making plays. ""We've been playing good, but we just haven't been able to get that win in the last two minutes, three minutes of the game. Hopefully, we can start stringing some together."" Lauri Markkanen had 13 points and 17 rebounds, Thaddeus Young scored 17 points, and Denzel Valentine had 16 for the Bulls. Harrell had 30 points and George had 27 for Los Angeles. The Clippers had won four in a row. Besides playing for the third time in four days at the end of a six-game trip, the Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard (injury management, left knee soreness), Lou Williams (right calf), Patrick Beverly (concussion) and JaMychal Green (tailbone contusion). This was the eighth game Leonard has missed. He scored 42 points Friday night at Minnesota. George was asked if the poor finish was a result of fatigue. ""Not necessarily,"" he said. ""This isn't new. We just got outplayed tonight."" Los Angeles led by 15 points midway through the second quarter before Chicago closed the first half with a 19-6 run to pull to 57-55. The Bulls continued the surge early in the third, scoring 17 straight points for a 75-61 lead. The 75 points were two more than Chicago scored Friday night in an 83-73 home loss to Charlotte. The Clippers answered with a 12-1 run to trim the deficit to 76-73 and pulled to 81-79 in the final minute of the third on a three-point play by Harrell. LaVine then hit a 3-pointer to give Chicago an 84-79 lead entering the fourth. In the final three minutes, George hit a pair of free throws to break a tie at 98 and Landry Shamet hit a 3-pointer for a 103-98 Clippers lead with 2 1/2 minutes remaining. With L.A. up by five a minute later, LaVine and Valentine hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions -- sandwiched around one of two free throws by George -- for a tie at 106 with 47.9 seconds left. TIP-INS Clippers: G Shamet returned after missing a month (17 games) with a high right ankle sprain. He finished with 11 points in 21 minutes. Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder sprain) missed his ninth straight game. He hasn't been cleared for contact and there is no timetable for his return. ""He shot earlier today, he got some three balls up, so that was encouraging,"" coach Jim Boylen said. WINNING PLAY The Bulls had planned to hold for the last shot, but that changed when George got caught out of position, clearing the path for LaVine. ""I just saw the one-on-one with Montrezl, so just go in there with a strong finish, try to get to the line,"" he said. ""I was able to come up with the and-one."" When asked what created the lane, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said: ""It was created by bad defense."" QUICK TURNAROUND The start of Friday night's game at Minnesota was pushed back nearly two hours to accommodate national TV, so the Clippers had less recovery time than a typical back-to-back. ""Our league has been great, but today's game, in my opinion, should not be played or happen,"" Rivers said. ""When you play basically an 8:45 p.m. game and then have to fly and get to your hotel at 3:45 and go to bed at 5, you probably shouldn't be playing basketball the next day -- especially if they're talking about our health."" HE SAID IT When asked if an 82-game regular-season schedule was too much, Rivers said: ""I don't know. If you see me walk, clearly 82 games is not healthy.""","401161024"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Rookie Ja Morant is drawing the accolades for the Memphis Grizzlies. Fellow first-round pick Brandon Clarke is showing his value as well. Clarke, who leads the league's rookies in field goal percentage at 65%, scored a season-high 25 points, converting 11 of 14 shots and the Grizzlies sent Washington to its fourth straight loss, beating the Wizards 128-111 on Saturday night. While Dillon Brooks led Memphis with 27 points, Clarke continued his accurate shooting touch, including making his only 3-point attempt. Clarke's play has been rewarding for Memphis. The 6-foot-8 forward from Gonzaga appeared undervalued on draft night last summer, dropping to 21st before Oklahoma City drafted Clarke and the Grizzlies immediately traded for him. ""Whoever passed up, messed up,"" said Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who had 16 points. ""He's definitely a Top 10 pick, if you're re-drafting this,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Clarke said the secret to his accuracy is built on work, particularly from 3-point range where he is 13 of 25 this season. ""Hard work and getting the reps and being comfortable shooting in the game,"" Clarke said. ""It took time in our practice, but now it feels really comfortable to shoot that wide-open 3."" Morant added 18 points to help the Grizzlies win for the third time in the last four. Memphis would set a season-high with points in the paint (70), and Clarke's 25 points helped the Grizzlies establish a season-standard for bench points with 59. ""That's been a problem,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of the points in the paint. ""I told our guys, I know we are short-handed, but we still have to be able to scrap. We did not scrap. enough."" Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 29 points, but was 8 of 23 from the field. Troy Brown Jr. had 16 points, while Ish Smith and rookie Admiral Schofield scored 14 each for Washington. Memphis built its lead late in the first half and then extended it to 21 early in the third. Solomon Hill, who was scoreless in the first half, converted all four of his 3-point shots in the third, as Memphis led 104-84 entering the final frame. The Grizzlies would stretch the advantage to 24 in the fourth. ""We haven't lost like this in a long time,"" Beal said. TIP-INS Wizards: C Moritz Wagner was out with a left ankle sprain. With Wagner out and Thomas Bryant suffering from a stress reaction in his right foot, little-used Ian Mahinmi was the only true center available and started. ...Beal had 10 rebounds to record his sixth double-double of the season. Grizzlies: F Jae Crowder did not play, suffering from left ankle soreness. ... The victory snapped a seven-game home losing streak. ... Memphis is 7-0 when Brooks scores at least 20. .The 17-point victory matched the largest over the Wizards in franchise history. The other 17-point win in the series was four years ago on Dec. 14, 2015 JAPANESE CONNECTION Wizards rookie Rui Hachimura and Grizzlies two-way player Yuta Watanabe were on the court at the same time in the second quarter, marking the first time in an NBA regular-season game that two Japanese-born players appeared in the same game. TOUGH NIGHT FOR BERTANS Davis Bertans who had 32 points in Tuesday's game at Charlotte, was held to nine points. He had reached double figures in 12 of his previous 13 games. Against Memphis, he was 2 of 9 from the field and made only one of his six 3-point shots. ""It's bound to happened,"" Brooks said. ""The guy has been on fire. He's been knocking down everything once he has stepped on the court. ... He will bounce back."" THOMAS CLOSE TO RETURN Wizards guard Isaiah Thomas, who was listed as questionable before the game, did not play, missing his fifth straight with a left calf strain. Thomas was a game-time decision. ""He's getting better, and that's the good thing,"" Brooks said of the decision to sit Thomas another game. ""He had a good workout (Saturday). It was close. He wanted to go once again, but that's the way he is. We just have to be careful.""","401161025"
"DALLAS --  A Dallas crowd stunned by Luka Doncic's ankle injury and the big deficit that followed was standing with the Mavericks in position to win late. Still, a huge comeback without the young phenom came up short. Doncic left in the opening minutes with a sprained ankle and the Mavericks rallied from 24 points down to take a lead into the final minute of regulation before falling to the Miami Heat 122-118 in overtime Saturday night. Bam Adebayo put Miami in front for good on a put-back dunk with 1:15 remaining in overtime and finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his second triple-double in three games. ""Anytime you lose your best player, the way he's been playing, it's rough,"" said guard J.J. Barea, a big part of the rally with 12 points in 13 minutes. ""But yeah, I think we did a great job. Everybody that came in stepped up and we put in a great effort."" Doncic's right foot landed on the foot of Heat guard Kendrick Nunn on a drive less than two minutes into the game. The reigning rookie of the year lost control of the ball for a turnover and limped off the court before going down behind the basket while play continued at the other end. He got up a short time later but went straight to the locker room. The team said X-rays were negative, but he didn't return. Doncic was playing two nights after the 20-year-old dazzled the crowd in Mexico City with a pre-game speech in Spanish before scoring 41 points with 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 122-111 victory over Detroit. It was his NBA-leading eighth triple-double of the season. The Slovenian guard entered the game averaging 30.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 9.3 assists per game while leading the resurgent Mavericks to the Southwest Division lead. While stressing it was just his opinion, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said he doesn't expect Doncic to play Monday at Milwaukee. ""If you play hard and do the right things for 48 minutes, you're always going to have a chance in this league,"" Carlisle said. ""We got plenty on this roster to win a game like this, even with Luka out. We just got to do better."" Without Doncic, Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 18 of his 28 points in the second half to help Dallas rally, but was shut out in overtime. Kristaps Porzingis, the other half of Dallas' star European pairing with Doncic, had 22 points and 14 rebounds but couldn't convert on two possessions late in the extra period. Then the 7-foot-3 Latvian gave up an offensive rebound after Jimmy Butler missed two free throws with nine seconds remaining. With another chance after another foul, Butler made two free throws for a three-point lead, and Jalen Brunson missed a 3-pointer just before the buzzer. Butler led Miami with 27 points, and Tyler Herro scored 19 as the Heat again avoided back-to-back losses for the first time this season. It was Miami's first win in five tries on the second night of a back-to-back, coming off a 113-110 loss to LeBron James and the Lakers at home. ""Obviously, the game looked totally different without Doncic there,"" Heat coach Eric Spoelstra said. ""But regardless, this team, the guys in that locker room, we needed a breakthrough. We've been playing horrible basketball on the second night of back-to-backs."" The Mavericks trailed by four when Doncic went down and the deficit ballooned to 19 in about five minutes and reached 24 in the second quarter. But Dallas wiped out a 23-point halftime deficit and the led twice in the fourth quarter, including 112-108 before the Heat scored the final four points of regulation. Hardaway missed a runner in the final seconds of regulation before Butler misfired on a pull-up 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""It's tough, especially winning on the road,"" Butler said. ""They're a good team, even without Luka. My prayer's out for him. I hate to see people go down, especially him and the year he's having. I was looking forward to the matchup."" Porzingis gave a stunned crowd the first chance to cheer by making a 3-pointer from the logo at center court to beat the first-quarter buzzer. TIP-INS Heat: Miami has won five straight games in the series. ... Butler extended his streak of games with at least 20 points to eight, the longest since Dwyane Wade had eight in March 2015. ... Adebayo also had two blocks. ... Kelly Olynyk had 17 points and eight rebounds. Nunn scored 13. Mavericks: Delon Wright returned after missing two games with a right abductor strain, going scoreless in nine minutes. ... Brunson had 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. ... Maxi Kleber, whose dunk gave Dallas its first lead at 104-103 with 4:28 remaining in the fourth quarter, scored a season-high 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting. BUSY BUTLER Butler played at least 40 minutes for the third time in five games, finishing at 43 minutes while going 1 of 6 from 3-point range while making 10 of 12 free throws. In the two games that fell short of 40 in the past five, Butler played 36 and 37 minutes. TALE OF TWO HALVES The Heat shot 63% from 3 (12 of 19) in the first half before 4 of 21 after halftime. Duncan Robinson and Butler combined to go 1 of 11 from beyond the arc in the second half and overtime. Robinson was among five Miami players with at least two 3s before halftime.","401161026"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo displayed his remarkable skills early and often as the Milwaukee Bucks continued their quest to break a franchise record that has stood for nearly half a century. The reigning MVP sank a 3-pointer for his first points of the game, then followed with a spinning layup, a wide-open dunk and a step-through slam for nine quick points to give Milwaukee an early lead. And when the Cleveland Cavaliers made it close in the second quarter, Antetokounmpo streaked down the court, received a feed from Donte DiVincenzo and threw down a one-handed dunk as the Bucks began to pull away. Antetokounmpo and the Bucks went on to beat Cleveland 125-108 Saturday night, their 18th consecutive win. ""You can try to game plan for Giannis and you can try to game plan for a team like that, but they're very long, they can shoot the ball and they can play inside out,"" Cavaliers forward Kevin Love said. ""They are on a major winning streak right now and they're playing some of the best, if not the best, basketball in the NBA."" The Bucks have won 22 of their last 23 and improved to 24-3, one-half game ahead of the idle Los Angeles Lakers for the best record in the league. The Bucks have not lost since Nov. 8 at Utah. The streak is the second longest in franchise history. The Bucks won 20 consecutive games in the 1970-71 season on the way to winning their lone NBA championship. ""When we run and our pace is really fast, everyone gets easy ones, and everyone gets open shots,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It just makes the game fun. And when the game is fun, I think everyone defends, also."" Kevin Porter Jr. had 15 points and Jordan Clarkson scored 13 for the Cavaliers, who grabbed a brief lead in the second quarter on a jumper by Clarkson but were then outscored 34-14 to close the period. The Bucks' lead grew to as many as 28 points in the third quarter, and they cruised the rest of the way for their 13th straight win at home. ""They're explosive in offensive transition,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""We have to do a better job there collectively. That lead can explode on you in a minute."" Cleveland, which had ended an eight-game losing streak with an overtime win over San Antonio on Thursday night, committed 18 turnovers that the Bucks converted into 21 points. ""Our turnovers are killing us right now,"" Beilein said. Love had 12 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland. Antetokounmpo, who missed his first game of the season Wednesday night against New Orleans, played just 24 minutes, while Middleton, who had 26 points on Friday night, played 23. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Dylan Windler is being re-evaluated for a stress reaction in his left leg. The team's first-round pick this year has yet to play for Cleveland. ""He really could give us a spark right now,"" Beilein said. ""I really feel bad for him. We'll let him go dormant for a couple weeks, see if it's nothing."" ... Ten players scored in the first half, but none reached double figures. Thompson and Darius Garland each had eight. ... John Henson, who hadn't made a 3-pointer this season, connected on back-to-back shots from deep in the fourth quarter.

The man crawled off the court before being immobilized and was carried away on a stretcher by emergency medical personnel. FINDING MOTIVATION Budenholzer said players have found their own motivation during the lengthy win streak. ""I'm not a big motivator,"" he said. I think (general manager) Jon (Horst) and the front office, we try to find guys that are competitive and self-motivated because I'm probably terrible at (motivating).

"HOUSTON --  When the Detroit Pistons had a comfortable lead entering the fourth quarter Saturday night, coach Dwane Casey knew the Houston Rockets would make a run late and he'd need someone to step up to hold them off. He got that boost from Derrick Rose, who came off the bench to score 10 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter to help the Pistons outlast the Rockets 115-107. ""That's what you've got to have and that's what his league is about is having players that can create their own shot,"" Casey said. ""And he did that. He was tough downs the stretch."" Luke Kennard scored 22 points as the Pistons didn't trail in the last two quarters and were up by double figures for most of the second half. Houston used a 9-2 run, with a 3 from Chris Clemons, to cut the lead to 112-107 with 41 seconds remaining. But Tony Snell made two free throws after that and Bruce Brown made one of two free throws after a miss by Houston to secure the victory. James Harden led the Rockets with 39 points after two straight 50-point games, but it wasn't enough to keep Houston's winning streak going on a night Russell Westbrook sat out to rest. Harden played 38 1/2 minutes, but was taken out with 1:23 left and didn't return. ""Our 3s were short and James got beat up and tired,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said of Harden, who played 36 minutes in a win over Orlando on Friday night. ""He carries a big load, but there were other things that needed to happen that just didn't happen for us."" Rose had 12 assists, Bruce Brown had 16 points and 10 rebounds and Markieff Morris added 15 points as the Pistons won for the third time in four games. Casey gave Brown credit for making things tough on Harden. He made just 14 of 33 shots. ""What Bruce did to pick up full court for every minute he was in there was a man's job because you're tired,"" Casey said. ""He's a little bit more tired because he played last night but it takes discipline and a lot of grit."" The Rockets used a 5-0 run to cut the lead to 8 with two minutes left. But Detroit got baskets from Rose and Kennard after that to push the lead to 110-98 with about 90 seconds to go. Detroit led by 12 after a 6-0 run capped by two dunks from Brown before the Rockets used a 7-2 spurt to get within 98-91 with about five minutes left. An 8-2 run by the Pistons, with the last six points from Rose, came next to push the lead to 106-93 with 3 1/2 minutes to go. The Pistons led by 10 at halftime and opened the second half with a 7-2 run to push the lead to 69-54 with about eight minutes left in the third. Detroit was still up by 15 later in the third quarter before the Rockets made the next eight points, with six from Harden, to cut it to 80-73 with three minutes left in the quarter. But the Pistons scored the next six points, with a 3 from Morris, to push the lead to 86-73 with about a minute left in the third. Detroit led 88-75 entering the fourth.

"DENVER -- Breaking out of a mini-slump, Nikola Jokic is reasserting himself as the centerpiece of the Denver Nuggets' offense. Jokic had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists for his fourth triple-double of the season, leading the Nuggets past the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-102 on Saturday night. Jokic now has 32 regular-season triple-doubles to tie Rajon Rondo for 11th on the career list. The stat line signaled his return to form after a series of off-target shooting performances and sluggish ball movement that bogged down the Nuggets' attack over the last two weeks. ""He's definitely well past rounding back into form,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""For Nikola, getting past those struggles that everybody goes through, it's just handling that adversity, staying with it and finding a way to stay aggressive, knowing that's the only way you're going to right the ship."" Jokic was effective from the perimeter and the low post, hitting three 3-pointers and muscling in a pair of dunks. When the defense collapsed on him, he was dishing off to the open man and figuring prominently in all five Denver starters scoring in double figures. Will Barton had 18 points and Jamal Murray scored 14 as the Nuggets beat the Thunder for a seventh straight time. ""When (Jokic) is aggressive, it just opens up everything for everybody else,"" said Gary Harris, who finished with 11 points. ""We were all clicking today. He was able to get assists, rebounds, points. He was able to do whatever he wanted."" Said Jokic: ""I've been playing like that my whole life, so it kind feels like I'm playing the way I'm supposed to play."" Dennis Schroder had 22 points to lead the Thunder. Steven Adams had 18 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 16 for Oklahoma City. Chris Paul finished with 15 points and 10 assists. ""I think it was a game where we just didn't shoot well,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""This was a game where we needed to have our defense be really elite, but we had some breakdowns, some missed opportunities, some blown coverages, and we couldn't overcome those things."" Leading by three at the break, Denver used a 12-2 burst late in the third quarter to take a 77-62 lead. Abdel Nader had the Thunder's lone basket in that span while Murray highlighted the Denver surge with a lob off the backboard that he put back through the net with a two-handed dunk. Torrey Craig later hit a 3-pointer and Juancho Hernangomez had a driving layup to help Denver take an 82-68 lead into the fourth quarter. The Thunder narrowed the deficit to five points on a jumper by Gilgeous-Alexander with 6:50 left to play, but the Nuggets then scored nine straight points, including a dunk and 3-pointer by Jokic for a 102-88 advantage with 4:35 remaining. The Thunder couldn't mount another threat. The Nuggets got off to a hot start, opening a 22-6 lead early, but the Thunder steadily gained on them and Adams' dunk pulled Oklahoma City within 52-49 at halftime.

"NEW ORLEANS -- Jonathan Isaac had 21 points and 10 rebounds and the Orlando Magic beat New Orleans 130-119 on Sunday, sending the Pelicans to their franchise-record 12th straight loss. We just got to play better. We got to play better, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. We just got to keep competing, and well try to get it figured out. Gentry was ejected late in the third quarter after receiving two technical fouls for complaining about officiating. It was his first ejection of the season. Orlando center Nikola Vucevic returnd from a sprained ankle to score 20 points. He played 29 minutes in his first game since Nov. 20. Im really happy to finally be back, Vucevic said. His teammates were thrilled to have the All-Star center back. He just knows how to play, Isaac said. Hes a great player. I think he slows the game down for us, and his ability to just bail us out with post-ups and knocking down shots is really (important for us). The Magic snapped a three-game losing streak. Jrue Holiday led the Pelicans with 29 points and eight assists. J.J. Redick added 23 points against the team that drafted him in the first round in 2006. Its hard to lose. Its also hard to win, so I feel like we got to just try to stay positive, Holiday said. The Magic led 58-57 at halftime and pulled away with a 41-point third quarter. Isaac had 11 points in the quarter. Orlando made a season-high 17 3s, shooting 50% from long range. The Magic shot 51.2% overall from the field and had just eight turnovers. TIP-INS Magic: D.J. Augustin had 17 points, and Even Fournier added 16. On Saturday night, Augustin, a New Orleans native, became the first athlete in any sport to have his jersey retired at Brother Martin High School. Augustin, who wore No. 14, led the school to two Louisiana state championships and is the programs career scoring leader. Pelicans: Brandon Ingram added 21 points, but early foul trouble limited him to 27 minutes.  Guard Josh Hart scored 20 points.  Before the game, Gentry reiterated the team is being overly cautious with No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, who has yet to play this season due to a knee injury. Hes still in the rehab stage of it.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Aaron Holiday didnt offer much of an explanation for his recent scoring surge that has helped the Indiana Pacers win three consecutive games. But theres no denying the second-year reserve guard has had a hot hand lately. On a Sunday when the Pacers relied heavily on their bench, Holiday scored 12 of his game-high 23 points in the final quarter of a 107-85 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Holiday, who entered with a 9.3-point average, had his third consecutive double-digit game and was a point shy of a career high set last month at Brooklyn. He was coming off games of 18 and 13 points. Im just playing, he said. My teammates did a good job of finding me in the right spots and I was able to knock some shots down for them. If he was certain of anything, it was that his team needed to regroup entering the fourth quarter after almost blowing a 15-point halftime lead. The cold-shooting Hornets managed to trim their deficit to 70-66 with a 22-13 third quarter. Once they cut the lead down, we just had to calm down and get back to playing the basketball we were playing before, push the pace and play defense, Holiday said. The Pacers finished the final frame with a 35-19 edge. Thirty-one of their points came from the bench, which provided 55 for the game. Reserve guard T.J. McDonnell also had 12. Those guys have been playing good since getting their opportunity, Pacers coach Nate McMillan said of his bench players. Theyve been a spark for us this short season, bringing energy to the game, a pace that speeds us up. Doug McDermott, a reserve guard who had not scored in three quarters, helped with a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth. By the time Holiday hit his second 3-pointer of the game, the Pacers had a 93-75 lead with 4:54 remaining. The Pacers held the Hornets to a season-low in points and shooting percentage (30.8). The visitors had a three-game winning streak snapped. Theyre a very good team, theyre deep, their bench is one of the strengths so they played well, give them credit, Hornets coach James Borrego said. They made shots and unfortunately we just didnt get enough stops there down the stretch. Pacers center Myles Turner scored 14 points with 10 rebounds. Domantas Sabonis added 12 points and 12 rebounds. Hornets forward Cody Zeller, a Hoosier native who typically plays well in front of family and friends, had 19 points and 12 rebounds. He accounted for eight of the teams 20 points in the opening quarter. If you would have told us wed win three in a row, I think wed be happy with that, Zeller said. It will be good to go back home off a pretty good road trip.","401161031"
"ATLANTA -- LeBron James finished off a whirlwind weekend with another dazzling performance. Not looking the least bit tired, James scored 32 points and the Los Angeles Lakers extended their winning streak to seven with a 101-96 victory over the pesky Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night. The Lakers pulled even with Milwaukee for the NBA's best record at 24-3. ""Highlights: sometimes they happen, sometimes they don't,"" James said. ""I try to play the game with a lot of joy."" After scoring 28 points in a win at Miami on Friday night, James flew to Columbus, Ohio, to watch son Bronny play a high school game Saturday night. Then, James traveled on to Atlanta to face the struggling Hawks. He never considered sitting out. ""I don't know how many games I've got left in my career,"" the 34-year-old James said. ""I don't know how many kids show up to come see me play. ... That's my obligation. My obligation is to play."" The Hawks kept it close all the way. Vince Carter passed up an open layup and dished to rookie Cam Reddish in the corner for a potential tying 3-pointer, but the shot clanked off the rim. Danny Green went to the other end and knocked down a pair of free throws to send the Hawks to their fourth straight loss. ""We did our best to compete,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I'm proud of our guys."" If the home team was hoping to get an off night from James, he quickly dispelled that notion. James had the crowd -- many of them decked out in his No. 23 jersey -- oohing and ahhing with an appropriate 23-point effort in the first half. He threw down three thunderous slams. He knocked down a couple of mid-range jumpers. He ventured out beyond the arc to swish a couple of 3-pointers -- including a step-back shot from nearly 5 feet behind the stripe to finish off the first half, sending the Lakers to the locker room with a 55-48 lead. He also had seven rebounds and blocked a shot, but the play that really had everyone talking was an assist -- a no-look, between-the-legs pass that caught Dwight Howard breaking down the lane for a massive dunk. Rondo also contributed to the ""Showtime"" performance, finishing off a four-on-one with a dazzling move that looked as though he was about to throw up a lob to James streaking off the wing. The lone defender, De'Andre Hunter, was left reeling as Rondo hung on to the ball for an uncontested layup. James flew in behind his teammate like he was going for the block, adding some style points to an already impressive play. James wasn't done. In the third quarter, he pulled up just inside the Hawks center-court logo and swished another 3-pointer from 36 feet to give the Lakers a 10-point edge. ""He was spectacular,"" Laker coach Frank Vogel said. ""He had some all-time clips."" Atlanta trailed by as many as 11 but kept the margin in single digits nearly the entire way. Trae Young led the Hawks with 30 points. Anthony Davis scored 27 points and grabbed 13 rebounds for the Lakers. James also had 13 rebounds, along with seven assists. HUERTER'S SHOULDER Kevin Huerter's left shoulder is hurting again. The Hawks guard re-injured his left shoulder about 4 minutes into the fourth quarter when he collided with Howard. ""I was trying to box him out and the arm kind of went limp,"" Huerter said. He was holding his left arm gingerly after the game, but the team doesn't believe the injury is as serious as his previous one. Huerter already missed 11 games with a strained left rotator cuff. ""We'll know more tomorrow,"" he said. ""We haven't done any tests yet."" TIP-INS Lakers: Davis grabbed at his right ankle when fouled on a lay-up in the closing minutes, but he was able to finish. ... Rondo was slapped with a technical late in the second quarter for griping about being called for a foul on Young.

Hawks: Pierce picked up a technical in the first half for arguing that a Lakers block should have been called for goaltending. ... Atlanta was outrebounded 56-42. ... The Hawks shot just 36 percent from the field. Young reached 30 points for the 13th time this season but was held to 9-of-22 shooting, including 3 of 11 from 3-point range.

"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie has been on the receiving end of some friendly banter from his Brooklyn teammates, especially Kyrie Irving, over not using his athleticism to rise above the rim. He took the opportunity on Sunday night against the 76ers and former teammate Tobias Harris, scoring 24 points and riling up the Brooklyn bench with an impressive jam on an inbound pass from Garrett Temple, as the Nets went on to beat Philadelphia 109-89. ""We showed it again in the locker room in the end and they got a big kick out of that,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I don't think people realize how good an athlete Spencer is. You could argue our best athlete. He's fast. He's got an incredible vertical. He's unbelievable. It doesn't surprise me. I wish he'd do it more."" Joe Harris scored 16 points, DeAndre Jordan had 13 points and 11 rebounds and Temple finished with 13 points for the Nets, who ended a two-game skid. Dinwiddie credited Temple's pass for his rim-shaking moment. ""Honestly it was a great pass by GT (Garrett Temple). I believe he threw it right over Tobias' ear,"" Dinwiddie said. ""I wouldn't have dunked it if they hadn't been calling fouls. So I was like, `Oh, OK, he's under the rim, he'll probably foul me.' But then I was like, `Man, I ain't gonna get no free throws out of this."" With All-Star center Joel Embiid sitting out with an upper respiratory illness, the 76ers did not have much of an answer for Dinwiddie and the Nets, who scored 64 points in paint. Ben Simmons scored 20 points and Tobias Harris chipped in 17 for the Sixers, whose five-game winning streak ended. ""He's aggressive. He's very talented. He gets downhill, loves downhill,"" Simmons said of Dinwiddie. ""He just plays. He plays with the freedom. I love the way he plays, but he dominates."" It was the first regular-season meeting between the teams since last April, when Philadelphia eliminated Brooklyn from the first round in Game 5 of the playoffs. Philadelphia looks much different this time around, having since added Al Horford to its interior game while losing Jimmy Butler as a free agent to Miami. Brooklyn was finishing a back-to-back after losing at defending NBA champion Toronto on Saturday night. The 89 points allowed to Philadelphia marked the fewest given up by the Nets this season. Brooklyn got a needed lift from its bench, with reserves scoring 23 first-half points en route to a 57-43 lead at halftime. For the game, the Nets bench outscored Philadelphia's 40-23. Dinwiddie's dunk midway through the third quarter sparked the Nets, who blitzed Philadelphia with a 10-0 run, capped by his pass to Jarrett Allen for an alley-oop jam that stretched the lead to 76-58 with 3:03 left. The 76ers didn't do themselves any favors during that stretch by missing seven shots. ""They're really hard to guard, especially Spencer Dinwiddie's ability to get into the paint,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. BACK IN UNIFORM F Wilson Chandler made his season debut for Brooklyn after serving a 25-game ban for using performance-enhancing drugs. Before taking the court, he gushed over his second chance after he was suspended August 29 for taking Ipamorelin. Chandler, who was signed to a one-year deal in July, was forced to watch his new team's games at home or at a restaurant. The 12-year veteran checked into the game with 5:26 remaining in the opening period and finished with two points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes. ""Having to watch those games, being away from the team, I was just hoping I could be out there and help at some point,"" Chandler said. TIP-INS 76ers: Horford played with a sore left knee and left hamstring. He finished with 10 points on 5-for-15 shooting from the field and added nine rebounds and five assists. . Philadelphia struggled with its 3-point shooting, making 5 of 26 attempts. . The 76ers, who have not lost a home game in 14 tries, dropped to 6-8 on the road. Nets: Dinwiddie has scored more 20 points in each of Brooklyn's last four games. He's notched 17 20-point games this season after doing so 18 times last year. HOME SWEET HOME Brooklyn improved to 10-5 against Philadelphia at Barclays Center, matching the most wins the team has recorded against any team at home since the team moved from New Jersey in 2012. The Nets are 10-2 against Orlando in Brooklyn.","401161033"
"DENVER --  Little went right for the Denver Nuggets in a rough third quarter. They made up for it with a big finish. Nikola Jokic scored 11 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, including a late go-ahead 3-pointer, to help the Nuggets hold off the New York Knicks 111-105 on Sunday night. ""That third quarter, we defended absolutely nobody,"" said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, whose squad blew nearly all of a 16-point halftime lead while being outscored 33-20 in the third. ""What I liked about that fourth was 21 points allowed, 29 percent shooting from the field (by the Knicks). Our defense stepped up when it needed to. Offensively, guys stepped up and made some plays and made some big shots."" Will Barton had 16 points, Gary Harris added 15 and Jamal Murray had 14, including a key 3-pointer in the late going. The Nuggets, who led by as many as 20 points, hung on for their 12th straight victory over the Knicks in Denver. ""We just stuck with it,"" Murray said. ""We know how good of a team we are. I think we just took it to another level in terms of our intensity and focus, especially in those last seven minutes."" Marcus Morris led New York with 22 points. The Knicks were coming off back-to-back road wins under interim coach Mike Miller. They played Denver 11 days ago in New York and lost by 37 points, a setback that preceded the firing of David Fizdale as coach. Miller said he liked the way the Knicks fought back to make a game of it. ""We put ourselves in a good position,"" Miller said. ""If we can put ourselves in the position where, with four minutes to play, we have a chance to win, then we're doing what we need to do."" Taj Gibson banked in a shot to put the Knicks up 91-89 with 9:50 left to play their first lead since the opening minutes. New York led by as many as five points before Denver came back to tie it at 98 on Barton's 3-pointer. Jokic connected on a 3-pointer and Denver regained the lead at 102-100. His driving layup with 24.4 seconds left capped an 11-0 run that stretched Denver's lead to 109-100. ENCOURAGING TRIP The Knicks finished 2-2 on their four-game West Coast swing, including winning successive games for the first time this season. ""We grew a lot this road trip,"" said Julius Randle, who finished with 20 points. ""Being able to come out .500 on a road trip is always good. We gave ourselves a chance to make it a great one, being up four late in the fourth. We didn't capitalize and missed some easy shots. They made shots and we lost. We get to come home and give ourselves a chance to start up again and play good again."" TIP-INS Knicks: Guard Allonzo Trier was inactive for a second consecutive game because of a concussion. Nuggets: Forward Paul Millsap missed a second straight game because of a right quadricep strain.","401161034"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  The Sacramento Kings flipped the script Sunday night in their one-sided rivalry against the Golden State Warriors. Bogdan Bogdanovich scored 25 points and Buddy Hield added 19 as the Kings routed the Warriors 100-79. Sacramento won for the fourth time in five games and shook off a disappointing home loss Friday to the lowly New York Knicks. The Kings also took a step in reversing the storyline against their Northern California rival, beating the Warriors for just the fourth time in the past 25 games between the teams dating to the 2013-14 season. ""I thought our guys were making the right pass, the extra pass,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""It shows what kind of shooting (we can have) when we play that way."" Sacramento improved to 12-14, holding Golden State to 39% shooting. The Warriors have lost eight of nine to fall to 5-23. The Kings thrived offensively, displaying excellent ball movement and shooting a season-best 60% from the field. The 79 points allowed also was a season-low for an opponent. Things could get better for the Kings, too, as their roster gets healthier. Second-year big man Marvin Bagley III, who had 17 points Sunday, recently returned from a broken thumb. Sacramento also expects to get starting point guard De'Aaron Fox back from a severely sprained ankle in the next week or so. Fox has missed five weeks. ""I'm just getting back, and to have him come back not too long after me, it'll be great for us,"" Bagley III said. ""We'll kind of get back to what we were doing before all the injuries happened."" The short-term future isn't as promising for Golden State, which because of injuries is just a shell of the team that's gone to five consecutive NBA Finals. Golden State was 6 of 25 from 3-point range Sunday and matched its season low for points in a game. Sacramento turned the ball over 29 times, yet the Warriors couldn't make the Kings pay. ""I've never seen a box score like this, where we forced 29 turnovers but lost by 21 points,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It shows you how poorly we played. Our decision-making was awful. It was an embarrassing loss tonight."" Willie Cauley-Stein, facing his former team, led the Warriors with 14 points on 7-for-9 shooting. Sacramento ended all doubt after halftime, outscoring Golden State 28-17 for the third quarter to command a 79-59 lead. TIP-INS Kings: Bagley III has played center since returning two games ago, and Walton said he envisions that continuing for the foreseeable future. Walton cited the Kings' success playing ""small-ball"" recently, and he thinks Bagley can be more effective in the pick-and-roll at the center spot. ... Sacramento's 29 turnovers were an NBA-high for any team this season. ... On the bright side, the Kings notched 27 assists. Warriors: Surprisingly, Golden State's 18 points in the first quarter weren't a season low for the opening period. That came Oct. 30 with 14 vs. Phoenix. ... F Eric Paschall missed his second game in a row with left hip soreness, but Kerr anticipates the rookie returning Wednesday against Portland. LINEUP SHUFFLE Golden State trotted out its 14th different starting lineup in 28 games this season. Damion Lee started at shooting guard in his first start as a Warrior and contributed 13 points, 10 of them in the first half. Glenn Robinson III slid from shooting guard to small forward with Paschall out.","401161035"
"DETROIT --  The Washington Wizards hardly missed during the first quarter, shooting 81% from the field. Then in the final period, they nearly repeated that feat. Bradley Beal scored 35 points and Isaiah Thomas added 23 to lift the Wizards to a 133-119 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. Washington led 43-31 after the first quarter, and after the Pistons rallied, the Wizards shot 78% from the floor in the fourth. Beal and Thomas each scored 11 points in the fourth and missed only one shot between them in that quarter. ""Brad's going to be Brad, so he's going to do what he's been doing all year, his whole career,"" Thomas said. ""Slowly, I'm feeling like myself more and more."" Thomas returned from a calf injury, while the Pistons were without injured stars Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. Washington shot 17 of 21 from the field in the first quarter. The Wizards made all three of their 3-point attempts and all six of their free throws in the opening period. ""You give a team 43 points in the first quarter, that's the game,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""You let a team see the ball go through the basket, a team that's been struggling. They lost how many straight?"" The Wizards snapped a four-game losing streak, and the Pistons failed to build on their victory at Houston on Saturday night. Detroit rallied after falling behind by 16 in the second quarter, but the Wizards were relentless offensively. Davis Bertans added 17 points for Washington. Derrick Rose and Markieff Morris each scored 22 points for Detroit. It was 67-61 at halftime, and Washington led 96-91 after three. In the final quarter, the Wizards' lead stayed between two and five until Beal's two free throws made it a six-point game with 5:20 to play. Thomas then added a 3-pointer to make it 117-108. The Wizards shot 14 of 18 in the final quarter and ultimately won comfortably. ""We couldn't get stops all game, couldn't get stops when they were shooting 3s,"" Morris said. ""It wasn't just in the fourth. They figured out how to get their best players involved."" Griffin has been dealing with a sore left knee, and Drummond missed a second straight game with left eye inflammation. BENCHES The Pistons and Wizards both came into the game averaging 46 points from their reserves -- two of the top marks in the NBA. In this game, Washington narrowly won the battle of the benches, 50-49. ""Both teams were out there scrambling and trying to figure out a lineup with all the injuries,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks, whose team has been missing star guard John Wall all season. ""We made enough plays and passed the ball and made some big shots."" BEEN A WHILE According to the Play Index at Basketball-Reference.com, this was the most points the Pistons allowed in regulation since 1995, when Seattle scored 134 against Detroit on March 12 and 133 against the Pistons on March 18. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington went 18 of 33 from beyond the arc in its 17th straight game with at least 10 3-pointers. ... Thomas missed five games with his calf injury. ... Rookie Rui Hachimura left with a groin injury after scoring seven points in 17:01. Pistons: Bruce Brown scored 20 points, two short of his career high.","401161036"
"TORONTO --  Raptors coach Nick Nurse expected guard Norman Powell would lose his starting spot once Fred VanVleet was healthy. Powell's recent offensive outburst is forcing Nurse to reconsider. Pascal Siakam scored 33 points, Kyle Lowry had 20 points and 11 assists, and Toronto beat the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers 133-113 Monday night. Powell scored 26 points, Serge Ibaka had 14 and OG Anunoby 12 as Toronto set a season-high in points and won for the eleventh time in 14 home games. The Raptors have won back-to-back at home after losing three straight here. Powell has scored 20 or more points in three straight games for the first time in his career. He scored 20 or more four times in 60 games last season. Lowry said it's the best string of games he's ever seen from Powell. ""Great stretch right now,"" Lowry said. ""He's shooting the ball confidently, pushing it in transition. I think he's understanding how to play in transition a lot better now."" Nurse echoed Lowry's praise. ""What I like is the speed at which he sees the open floor and goes for it,"" Nurse said. VanVleet has missed four straight games because of a sore right knee but is getting closer to a return. Whether he comes back as a starter or a bench player remains to be seen. For his part, Powell doesn't mind whether or not he starts. ""I'll do whatever helps the team,"" he said. ""Coming off the bench or starting, it doesn't matter to me as long as we're winning."" Lowry's double-double was his 110th with Toronto, tying Antonio Davis for third-most in franchise history. They trail Jonas Valanciunas (137) and Chris Bosh (239). The double-double was Lowry's second in seven games since returning from a left thumb injury that sidelined him for 11 games. ""I'm getting a little bit better,"" Lowry said. ""Still need a little bit of time, but I'm getting a little bit better."" Collin Sexton scored 25 points, Darius Garland had 20 and Tristan Thompson 18 as the Cavaliers lost for the 16th time in 18 games. Cleveland has dropped two straight after winning 117-109 at San Antonio on Thursday night to snap a season-long eight-game skid. ""They're just a really good team and certainly a better team than us tonight,"" Cavs coach John Beilein said of the Raptors. The Raptors scored eight points off six Cavaliers turnovers in the first quarter. Love led the Cavs with seven points in the first, and Cleveland closed the quarter with a 10-0 run but still trailed 37-29. The Cavaliers made only two turnovers in the second but couldn't close the gap on Toronto. Powell scored six points in the quarter and the Raptors led 66-54 at halftime. Powell drew gasps for his one-handed slam dunk from Siakam's high lob pass in the third. Powell scored 16 points in the quarter, and Siakam added 13 to give the Raptors a 104-84 lead. ""It was good to show that I've still got the bounce,"" Powell said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland is 1-8 against Atlantic Division opponents. ... The Cavaliers are 3-11 on the road. ... Cleveland has lost seven of eight games in December. ... The Cavaliers finished with 11 turnovers, leading to 18 points for the Raptors.

TAKE CARE Toronto's seven turnovers were a season-low. The Raptors had two turnovers in the first half.","401161037"
"HOUSTON --  After Houston completed the biggest comeback in franchise history, Russell Westbrook was asked about the key to the win. The star guard didn't speak for several seconds. He simply patted his chest several times, crediting the Rockets' heart for the victory. Westbrook scored 31 points, James Harden had 28 and Houston set a franchise record by overcoming a 25-point deficit to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-107 on Monday night. Sometimes you've got to want it more than the other team, Westbrook said. It's that simple. No plays or no possessions or no shots can change that. The comeback eclipses the 23-point deficit Houston faced in a 110-107 victory against Portland on Jan. 22, 1977. The game was tied with 2 1/2 minutes remaining when Houston's P.J. Tucker hit a 3-pointer from the corner. A layup by Rudy Gay got the Spurs within one with just under a minute left before Harden missed a 3 on the other end. A 3-pointer by Bryn Forbes rolled on the rim before bouncing out, and Harden made two free throws to extend the lead to 109-106 with 16.2 seconds left. Forbes missed another 3 with 10 seconds left, but the Spurs got the ball back when Clint Capela knocked the the ball out of bounds while fighting for a rebound. The Rockets then intentionally fouled two times, and Derrick White made a free throw before purposely missing the second one with 2.7 seconds left. But Westbrook grabbed the rebound to secure the win. Houston fell behind early in a game where Harden had just nine points on 4-of-17 shooting in the first half. He warmed up after the break and finished 10 of 29. My confidence is never gone, no matter if I go 0 for 20 or whatever, he said. I'm always going to shoot the ball and be aggressive. Early my shot wasn't falling ... and then other guys stepped up. The Spurs managed just 35 points after setting a season high for first-half scoring. LaMarcus Aldridge led San Antonio with 19 points and 13 rebounds, and Forbes had 18 points. Some ways it's like your worst nightmare to go up 20 quickly because you know the thing is going to turn to some degree, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. So the way it was an even game down the stretch is pretty much what you'd expect most of the time."" It was the first meeting between the teams since a 135-133 win by the Spurs in double overtime on Dec. 3 in which a dunk by Harden was wrongly disallowed, leading to a protest by the Rockets. Houston lost the protest, which would have resulted in part of the game being replayed. But the league said it disciplined the officials who got the call wrong and botched the aftermath by not allowing Houston to challenge the ruling. The Rockets cut the lead to three on a dunk by Capela with about 10 minutes left before DeMar DeRozan scored four quick points to stretch it to 93-86. A 13-4 run by Houston made it 99-97 with five minutes to go, lifting the Rockets to their first lead since 2-0. The Rockets got four points from Danuel House and a 3 from Harden in that stretch while the Spurs missed seven shots. DeRozan tried to explain how things went so wrong for the Spurs after the break. They just picked it up, he said. We kind of slacked. It's always hard playing with a lead. Every single quarter, you have to play even harder, because nobody wants to get embarrassed. The Spurs were up 72-53 at halftime. THEY SAID IT Popovich on if playing four straight overtime games caught up to the Spurs on Monday night: How would I know that? Is there a way to gauge that? Right. TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray received a technical for pushing Harden in the first quarter. Harden also got a technical. ... White had 16 points off the bench. Rockets: The Rockets made just 11 of 43 3s. ... Capela had 15 points and 15 rebounds.","401161038"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  This time, Ja Morant and Memphis landed the final punch against Miami. Morant had 20 points and 10 assists to lead the Grizzlies to a 118-111 victory over the Heat on Monday night. Jonas Valanciunas finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds as Memphis won for the fourth time in five games. De'Anthony Melton scored 16 points, and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 15. The Grizzlies also played Miami in their season opener on Oct. 23, losing 120-101 when the Heat rallied in the fourth quarter. The Heat put together another big finish Monday night, but the Grizzlies responded with their own push. ""We just learned,"" Morant said of the difference since the first game of the season. ""I feel like we lost a lot of games late in the fourth quarter. A team would go on a run, and we weren't able to bounce back from it. ... We're just learning from our mistakes."" Miami had won four of five, including three overtime victories. Jimmy Butler had 25 points and eight assists, and Tyler Herro scored 22 points. ""Our (man) defense was pretty poor all the way through,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""The zone defense gave us a little bit of life. I don't know if it was because it got them out of rhythm or because we were just more active."" The Grizzlies were up by 11 when Butler went on his own 7-0 run in the fourth. Derrick Jones Jr. then scored five points to help Miami take a 107-104 lead with 5:30 left. Memphis responded with 11 straight points for a 115-107 lead on a Morant drive with 2:31 left. Jones finished with 15 points for Miami, and Bam Adebayo recorded his sixth straight double-double with 14 points and 13 rebounds. It was Miami's first loss of the season to a sub-.500 team. ""Even in the midst of the second half (the Heat) were going on, you wouldn't believe the communication the guys had,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""No one was overthinking it and putting their heads down, which were some of the moments earlier in the season."" BAM AWARD Adebayo was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week earlier Monday after averaging 20 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.7 assists in three games last week. ""I love it. I love it for him,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's all about the right things. This won't go to his head. It's not like he is doing this for individual accolades.""

"MILWAUKEE --  The Bucks have little time to reflect on the end of their 18-game winning streak. Milwaukee's impressive run was halted Monday night when Seth Curry and Kristaps Porzingis each scored 26 points to help the Dallas Mavericks hang on for a 120-116 victory even without star guard Luka Doncic. Milwaukee, which dropped to 24-4 with its first loss since a 103-100 setback Nov. 8 at Utah, next hosts LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers (24-3) on Thursday in a matchup of conference leaders. ""It's going to be a test for us,"" said Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 48 points and 14 rebounds. ""The Lakers are one of the best teams in the league. We've got to play good basketball. We've got to move the ball. Obviously as a team, we don't want to lose two in a row."" The winning streak was the Bucks' longest since a franchise-record 20 consecutive victories by the 1970-71 championship team that featured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, and Oscar Robertson. Dallas led comfortably for most of the fourth quarter until the final half-minute. Tim Hardaway Jr. hit the second of two free throws to make it 119-114 with 7.6 seconds left. Antetokounmpo scored on a layup and was fouled, but missed the free throw. Sterling Brown grabbed the offensive rebound, but his putback was blocked by Porzingis. ""I'm proud of the way the guys fought to the very last second tonight,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""To find a way to be close in the fourth quarter and have an offensive rebound and give ourselves a chance, I think it's just a sign of the competitive nature of this group."" Doncic sat out with a sprained right ankle, while the Bucks were missing injured point guard Eric Bledsoe. Milwaukee trailed 86-76 entering the fourth quarter and pulled to 99-92 before Porzingis hit back-to-back 3-pointers from long range. The Bucks got no closer until the final 23 seconds. Dallas was 16 of 41 from 3-point range, including four 3s each by Curry and Porzingis. The Bucks went 11 of 41 from beyond the arc. ""I hit those two deep 3s but even then, Giannis was right there in front of me,"" Porzingis said. ""They know we are a pretty good shooting team. But we have so many weapons and anybody on any given night can score 20-plus points. That's the dangerous thing about us. Tonight, Seth played great. It's kind of hard to play against a team that has so many options."" Kyle Korver added a season-high 17 points for Milwaukee, including five 3-pointers. Milwaukee trailed 69-67 when Antetokounmpo went to the bench with 6:32 left in the third quarter, having scored all 11 of the Bucks' points in the period. Dallas led 75-69 when Antetokounmpo returned after a two-minute breather, and the Mavericks pushed the margin to 80-69. Dallas was 7 of 13 beyond the arc in the first quarter en route to a 36-22 lead entering the second period. ""I've been in this league a long time and an 18-game winning streak is a spectacular demonstration of how good a team is,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""But you're not going to win every game to finish the season. We just felt that if we came out and really concentrated on ourselves, with a pretty simple game plan, we give ourselves a chance."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic, who sprained his ankle Saturday against Miami, is improving. ""He is responding well to treatment. He's off crutches and out of a boot,"" Carlisle said. ""He's progressing well. He will not play on Wednesday. If there's any update, it will be Wednesday night."" The 20-year-old Doncic, third in the NBA in scoring at 29.3 points per game, did not travel with the team to Milwaukee.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Chris Paul had a simple message for the Oklahoma City Thunder amid a 19-point halftime deficit. ""We always got a chance,"" he said. He made sure of that Monday night. Paul hit five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and the Thunder overcame a 26-point second-quarter deficit to beat the Chicago Bulls 109-106. Paul took over in the fourth, going 5 for 5 from deep and scoring 19 of his 30 points. His fourth 3-pointer of the quarter put Oklahoma City ahead 101-100, its first lead since the opening seconds. Paul also had nine rebounds and 10 assists. The Bulls tied it at 106 before Steven Adams put the Thunder ahead with a free throw and Paul added two more in the final five seconds.

Zach LaVine scored 17 points, Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 and Ryan Arcidiacono added 10 while the Bulls shot 58% in the half. LaVine finished with 39 points. ""They were so aggressive and a lot of our turnovers were turning into buckets for them,"" Paul said. ""Once we settled down and let the game come to us, I think we got better."" Paul had two points at the break. ""He really did a great job. Not only finding his spots to go score, but certainly making the game easy for everybody else,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I'm really glad that he's around a lot of our younger players. He understands how long the game and he understands the number of possessions. I think guys like him have a mental computer that helps them gather information on what's available."" The Thunder pulled within 19 at halftime, with Danilo Gallinari keeping them close with 17 first-half points. Oklahoma City whittled it down to eight after three quarters and an 8-0 run in the final minute of the period. Gallinari finished with 22 points and Dennis Schroder had 18 off the bench for the Thunder. ""Chris Paul made some big-time plays,"" Bulls guard Kris Dunn said. ""That's him being a vet. You've got to take the positives out of there. The biggest thing we've got to harp on is finishing games.""

"PHOENIX --  Damian Lillard wasn't concerned when officials went to video review over his potential tying layup with 26 seconds left. Either he'd be called for a charge, or the Suns' Aron Baynes would be called for a block. ""I knew it was a block,"" Lillard said. ""He was moving underneath."" Sure enough, Baynes was called for the foul and the layup counted. Lillard converted the ensuing free throw for a three-point play, the Blazers put together a final defensive stand and Portland escaped with a 111-110 win over the Suns on Monday night. CJ McCollum led the Blazers with 30 points on 11-of-20 shooting from the field while Lillard added 27 points. Portland led for most of the fourth quarter, but Phoenix pulled ahead 110-108 with 32 seconds left when Kelly Oubre Jr. converted a four-point play. He took an inbound pass from Ricky Rubio and nailed a turnaround 3-pointer while being fouled, then hit the free throw. On the next possession, Lillard drove straight through the lane and made a layup while crashing into Baynes, who was trying to slide into position for the charge. Lillard made the free throw and Phoenix couldn't score on its final possession as Rubio's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim with two seconds left. ""There's a lot of opinions in there, but if I would have made the shot, we would've won the game,"" Rubio said. ""It was almost a buzzer beater. We'll take that every day."" Portland has won 11 straight against the Suns. The Blazers trailed 49-33 midway through the second quarter but methodically worked their way back into the game. Phoenix scored just 43 points in the second half on 34% shooting. ""We held them to 21 points in the third quarter and that was huge for us,"" McCollum said. ""It gave us a chance to come back. Fourth quarter we got stops."" Oubre led Phoenix with 24 points. Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky III both added 17 for the Suns, who played a second straight game without star guard Devin Booker because of his right forearm injury. ""It was an exciting game,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""I think both teams at the end could have ended up with a win and we were fortunate at the end that we made one extra play."" Portland pulled ahead for the first time midway through the third when McCollum's 3-pointer made it 82-80. The Blazers took a 90-88 advantage into the fourth quarter. Carmelo Anthony, who scored 23 points, hit a 3 to put the Blazers ahead 100-97 with seven minutes left. The 35-year-old also made a turnaround jumper over Oubre with less than three minutes remaining that pushed Portland's advantage to six. Hassan Whiteside added 10 points and 14 rebounds for the Blazers. Phoenix lost for the fourth time in five games and has a quick turnaround against the Clippers on Tuesday. ""If you're going to play in high-level games, you've got to learn how to manage nights like this,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. The Suns grabbed an early 11-3 lead and stayed ahead for the entire first half, taking a 67-59 advantage into the break. Oubre and Saric both scored 13 points for Phoenix, while Kaminsky added 12. McCollum led the Blazers with 18. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: G Mario Hezonja (back spasms) didn't play in the second half. ... The Blazers improved to 11-16.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Malik Monk noticed teammates Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier were struggling from the field, so he figured it was time to do something about it. ""I seen that a little bit when I looked at the (stat) sheet,"" Monk sad. ""We were just off, and there wasn't anybody else scoring. So somebody had to step up and I was able to do that."" Monk scored 14 of his season-high 23 points in the fourth quarter on 5-of-5 shooting, and the Charlotte Hornets spoiled De'Aaron Fox's return from injury with a 110-102 win over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. Cody Zeller had 17 points and nine rebounds, and Bismack Biyombo added 10 points and 12 rebounds as the Hornets (13-17) won for the fourth time in five games. On a night when Graham and Rozier shot a combined 5 of 21 through the first three quarters, the Hornets needed a spark in the fourth and Monk provided it. He scored eight straight points early in the quarter, including a pair of 3s from the same spot just a few feet left of the top of the key. That seemed to ignite Graham, Charlotte's leading scorer this season, who knocked down two more 3s for a 10-point lead with six minutes left as part of a 23-11 run to begin the fourth. Monk had five his career-high 10 rebounds in the fourth quarter, including a putback dunk off a missed 3-pointer by Rozier to seal the game with 42 seconds left. ""I was attacking the rim, wasn't being too passive and just looking to score first,"" Monk said. Hornets coach James Borrego said it was Monk's best game of the season. ""He was fantastic on both ends of the floor,"" Borrego said. ""To have 10 rebounds is just a credit to his engagement on that end of the floor. Rebounding, defending, attacking the rim. I thought he was fantastic tonight. Really proud of his effort tonight. Our bench tonight was great."" Fox returned after missing 17 games with left ankle sprain and led the Kings (12-15) with 19 points. He played 30 minutes despite supposedly being on a minutes restriction. ""It was nice to get De'Aaron Fox back out there,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""I thought he looked good and was moving well, created some good looks and opportunities for us and we will continue to get better and learn from this game."" TIP-INS Kings: Were outrebounded 51-33. Hornets: F Nic Batum (hand) did not play. ... Charlotte scored 52 points in the paint. WILLIAMS BIG RETURN After missing the previous five games with knee issues, veteran Charlotte forward Marvin Williams had 16 points, three rebounds and two blocks in his first game back. His 16 points came on 5-of-8 shooting from the field, including 3 of 5 from beyond the arc. This was his sixth game of the season with at least three 3-pointers. GOING BIG With P.J. Washington recovering from a broken finger, the Hornets started two big men in Zeller and Biyombo. ""It's given us size, its given us rebounding, rim pressure,"" Borrego said. ""We just feel bigger, stronger out there with those two guys. I don't know where we go from here. I thought tonight and last game it gave us at what those two guys can do for us defensively and on the boards. They're both great rebounders and they both play extremely hard."" BAGLEY FEELING BETTER Marvin Bagley III had 14 points and seven rebounds off the bench in 22 minutes for the Kings. ""I feel great,"" Bagley said of slowly working back into form. ""I feel like how I was before I got hurt conditioning-wise. Just have to keep going and keep pushing."" Bagley said it might take the Kings some time to get used to him and Fox being back in the rotation for the team to regain its chemistry. ""Its different because the whole time I was out and De'Aaron was out they had a certain group (on the floor) and we just need to work our way back in,"" Bagley said. ""It changes it up a little bit but I think it's coming along. It's coming along fine. Like I said, we just let this one go. It's nothing to worry about. We just have to fix our mistakes and continue to move forward and try to win.""","401161043"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Malcolm Brogdon saw an opening and took it Tuesday night. And just like that, the Los Angeles Lakers' long winning streak away from home was over. Brogdon drove past Dwight Howard with 36.4 seconds left, scoring the tiebreaking basket on a nifty reverse layup to help the Indiana Pacers protect their home court with a 105-102 victory over the NBA's best road team. ""We knew when we threw a punch, they would punch back,"" Domantas Sabonis said. ""We just stuck together."" Eventually, the Pacers threw enough scoring jabs to earn their fourth straight victory -- perhaps their most impressive all season. The Lakers (24-4) came into the game with the league's best record and 14 straight wins on the road, the second-longest streak in franchise history and two wins short of their record-setting mark from 1971-72. But even LeBron James couldn't bail them out with All-Star forward Anthony Davis missing the game because of a sprained right ankle. Yes, James scored 20 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, but he missed a step-back 3-pointer with 11.7 seconds left that would have given the Lakers the lead. A replay review overturned a call and gave the Pacers the ball. Sabonis then made one of two free throws to finish with 26 points and 10 rebounds. Rajon Rondo and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope each missed a shot before time expired as the Lakers desperately tried to force overtime. ""Throughout the winning streak, we were able to keep our composure, whether we were up or down, still being able to make a game of it, which we did tonight,"" James said. ""But sometimes the ball doesn't bounce your way."" That was certainly true Tuesday. After leading most of the first half, the Lakers trailed most of the second half until a 9-0 spurt midway through the fourth quarter turned a five-point deficit into a 95-91 lead. It didn't last long. Brogdon's mid-range jumper with 2:20 left tied the score at 100. Myles Turner broke the tie by making two free throws with 1:59 left. Nineteen seconds later, James' free throws tied it up again and that's how it stayed until Brogdon took matters into his own hands and charged right past Howard and deftly used the rim to protect the ball for the basket. ""We trust him with the ball in his hands and he's been making tough shots for us,"" Sabonis said. ""He's been big for us all year."" TIP-INS Lakers: James scored only seven points in the second half -- all in the fourth quarter -- and had five turnovers. ... Howard had a season-high 20 points. ... Avery Bradley had 13 points, Alex Caruso had 11 while JaVale McGee and Caldwell-Pope each scored 10. ... Rondo had seven points and seven assists. ... The Lakers were 8 of 31 on 3-pointers. Pacers: Jeremy Lamb left in the second half with a sore right groin. ... Sabonis posted his 23rd double-double this season and had four assists ... Turner finished with 16 points and seven rebounds, while Brogdon had 14 points and six assists. ... T.J. Warren had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocks as Aaron Holiday and T.J. McConnell combined for 21 points off the bench. ... Indiana was 13 of 20 from the free throw line. SPEAKING FRANK-LY As Pacers coach Nate McMillan scouted the Lakers game tape, he saw some familiar plays and heard some familiar language. That shouldn't come as a surprise given his experience working alongside Lakers coach Frank Vogel for three seasons with Indiana. ""A lot of times, things travel with us,"" McMillan said. ""So they're doing some of the things he did when he was here, and they're doing some of the things he wanted to do when he was here."" Vogel hired McMillan as associate head coach in 2013. McMillan took over as the Pacers head coach when Vogel was let go after the 2016-17 season. THEY SAID IT Lakers: ""We wanted to get LeBron coming off a pin down from Dwight and we didn't execute the play very well,"" Rondo said when asked about his 29-footer in the waning seconds. ""I got a look that I wanted, it just went in and out."" Pacers: ""We're a really good team. We've got to come to play every night,"" Brogdon said. ""But we can compete. We can beat anybody.""","401161044"
"NEW YORK --  In a battle between struggling teams, the New York Knicks had arguably their best game of the season and the Atlanta Hawks hit a new low. Rookie RJ Barrett scored a career-high 27 points, and the Knicks ran away from Trae Young and the Hawks for a 143-120 win on Tuesday night. Mitchell Robinson had a career-high 22 points along with 13 rebounds, and Marcus Morris also scored 22 for the Knicks, who have won three of four after a 10-game losing streak. New York improved to 3-3 under interim coach Mike Miller, who took over after David Fizdale was fired eight games into the skid and has the team believing it can turn its season around. ""We're trending in the right direction,"" Morris said. ""I'm not going to go out and say we're going to make the playoffs, but ... that's what we're fighting towards. That's the goal. We're definitely trying hard. Hopefully, we do make it. If we continue to play like this and pull together, we have a great shot to do it."" Robinson said the coaching change was a catalyst for the team. ""We were pretty much tired of the way the season was going,"" he said. ""We just decided we needed to make some changes. We did that energy-wise and we came out and we compete our (butts) off."" Young scored 42 points for the Hawks, who lost their fifth straight. De'Andre Hunter added 19 points. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce delayed his postgame meeting with reporters to talk to his team. ""As expected, a very frustrated room,"" Pierce said. ""It's tough when you come off of an effort you have on Sunday against the Lakers and you come here. We couldn't hit first, we played on our heels, we let a lot of things impact our effort. That's the biggest thing I keep talking about. Competitive spirit, trying to find that effort. We don't have it right now."" New York went ahead by 31 points on Barrett's three-point play early in the third quarter and never looked back. Young did his best to keep Atlanta in the game with 22 points in the first half, but New York held the Hawks to 42% shooting in building a 77-53 lead at the break. The Knicks went on a 26-5 run starting in the first quarter and continuing into the second. TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce said he believes Young and John Collins are the best pick-and-roll duo in the league. ... Collins (suspension) missed his 23rd straight game and is eligible to return on Dec. 23.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Spencer Dinwiddie and the Brooklyn Nets didn't sound bothered that a team that hasn't won in almost a month took them to overtime. They were more gratified to know their defense could bail them out on nights when shots aren't falling. Dinwiddie scored 31 points and the Brooklyn Nets beat New Orleans 108-101 in overtime on Tuesday night, extending the Pelicans' franchise-long losing streak to 13 games. ""I know I sound like a broken record, but it's the same old thing,"" Dinwiddie said. ""If we can hold a team to 100, then we have a chance to win. ""Tonight, we were pretty bad offensively,"" he added. Joe Harris scored 24 points as he and Dinwiddie scored more than half of the Nets' points on a night when they shot 41.7% (40 of 96) and missed 28 of 39 3s. ""The shots will definitely come. We've just got to continue to be aggressive,"" Harris said. ""Sometimes you're going to have a couple of games -- a stretch -- where you might be off, but what's important is that the defense has been constant throughout. That's something that's really encouraging, that when you can play that solid defensively and give yourself a chance to win."" Harris curled to the right wing on a play drawn up out of a timeout, received the inbound pass and immediately pulled up for his fifth 3 of the game to put Brooklyn ahead 104-98 with 1:28 to go in the extra period. Brandon Ingram quickly responded with a 3, but the Pelicans, who missed 71 of 108 shots on the night, got no closer. ""The guys, they are still competing and playing hard,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""This was probably our best defensive game against a team that's really a good offensive team. ... I didn't think we got discouraged. I though we played. I thought we battled. We just came up short."" Ingram had 22 points and 10 rebounds but missed 10 of his first 11 shots before scoring all but two of his points after halftime. Jrue Holiday scored 21 points for the Pelicans, who kept the game competitive despite shooting 34.3% and missing 29 of 40 from 3-point range. Jarrett Allen had 12 points, 14 rebounds and tied a career-high with six blocks for the Nets, who've won five of seven. ""It was an ugly game,"" said Allen, whose transition dunk to tie the game at 93 in the final minute of regulation. ""I don't know how we pulled it out."" No team led by more than eight points in a game with 14 lead changes and 13 ties. Brooklyn looked primed to take control when Taurean Prince scored his first points of the game on a transition 3 with 2:53 left in regulation for an 89-83 Nets lead. But the Pelicans quickly responded with Holiday's layup and Lonzo Ball's 3, then took a 93-91 lead when Holiday was fouled while attempting a two-handed dunk that rolled in off the front rim. Holiday and Dinwiddie both missed 3s in the final half-minute or regulation. ""They're going to break their streak. We're just happy it wasn't against us,"" said Nets guard and former LSU star Garrett Temple. ""For us to be in OT after shooting the way we did against a desperate team like that on the road, we felt good that we were going to be able to close them out."" TIP-INS Nets: Dinwiddie has scored 24 or more points in five of his last six games. ... Reserve David Nwaba had 12 points, going 2 of 3 from 3-point range. ... The Nets shot 41.7% (40 of 96) and missed 28 of 39 3s. Pelicans: Executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin said rookie Zion Williamson's surgically repaired right knee is now ""fully weight-bearing,"" allowing him to begin some on-court basketball activities including shooting. ""We are a little ways away yet, but today was a really big first step,"" Griffin said. Williamson is now beyond the initial six- to-eight-week timeframe for his rehab from a scope of his meniscus. Griffin did not provide a new target date for his return. ... J.J. Redick did not play because of his sore left groin. ... The Pelicans had 17 offensive rebounds and outrebounded Brooklyn 59-55, but had only 13 second-chance points. DRY SPELL The Pelicans led by as many as eight points in the first half when Josh Hart made three 3s in less than two minutes to make put New Orleans up 35-27 with 7:30 left in the second quarter. The Pelicans then went scoreless for the rest of the half, missing 16 straight shots and turning it over three times, twice on shot-clock violations. The Nets took advantage with a 15-0 run during which Dinwiddie scored eight points and took a 42-35 lead into halftime. New Orleans' scoring drought ended just short of nine minutes on Ball's pull-up jumper. ""We defended amazingly,"" Temple said. ""Any stretch like that has an effect on the game.""","401161046"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchells dunk changed everything. With the Jazz trailing by seven in the fourth quarter, Mitchell drove down the lane and rose up to jam the ball in traffic over Nikola Vucevic. The highlight-reel play awoke a moribund offense and energized the crowd, sparking a late spurt that sent Utah past the Orlando Magic 109-102 on Tuesday night. On a play like that you cant lay it up, youve got to go up there and try and dunk it, Mitchell said. I really dont know how it happened. I didnt dunk in warmups. I just didnt have any legs. But he found plenty of energy when Utah needed him most. Mitchell finished with 30 points, including eight as the Jazz (16-11) closed the game on a 19-5 run for their third victory in a row. The guys kept their focus. There was no hanging their heads, coach Quin Snyder said. We didnt let those mistakes pull us apart, but they brought us together and thats what the game at the end reflected. Bojan Bogdanovic scored nine of his 30 points during the decisive surge, and Joe Ingles had 16 points and a season-high 12 rebounds. Bogdanovic and Mitchells two-man game was unstoppable down the stretch as they became the first Jazz duo to score 30 points each in a game since Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer did it in 2008. When it gets to six minutes and under, Bogey doesnt miss. To have that type of confidence  it makes our team so much better and we missed that at times last year, Mitchell said. Bogdanovic feels the same way. Theres a great, great connection between us ... especially at the end of games, he said. D.J. Augustin had 22 points off the bench, including 14 in the fourth quarter, and Evan Fournier added 19 for the Magic, who fell to 12-15. The game was there for us to take it. We just didn't make plays in the last three minutes. It (stinks) because we fought our way back,"" Vucevic said. After a 3-pointer by Ingles and a free throw by Ed Davis, the Jazz led 82-65. But the Magic mounted a quick comeback against Utahs struggling bench players. Fourniers basket capped a 12-0 run to get the Magic to 82-77 early in the final quarter. Orlando then overcame an eight-point deficit to lead 97-90 after a 15-0 spurt powered by Augustins seven points. A game after hitting a season-high 17 3-pointers, the Magic missed their first 10 attempts from beyond the arc and ended up 7 for 35 from 3-point range as they seemed reticent to challenge Rudy Gobert inside. Obviously, it opens up a lot of things when you can make 3s -- especially with a guy like Rudy inside. You want to split him off. But if you keep missing, he's going to stay in there,"" Fournier said. Gobert had a double-double by halftime with 10 points and 12 rebounds as the Jazz built a 58-47 lead at the break. We fought hard, so I just told the guys, Look, if we would have played as hard in the first half, we might have won, Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Mike Conley returned for the Jazz after missing five games with a tight hamstring but left in the third quarter when the pain returned. He had seven points and six assists. Ingles, who has primarily been a reserve this season, began starting when Conley was out and has been scoring and shooting at a much higher clip. The Australian forward stayed in the starting lineup Tuesday. Vucevic, in his second game back after an 11-game absence, had 12 points on 4-for-15 shooting. He grabbed 11 rebounds. YOU GOT TO MOVE IT, MOVE IT One sequence typified the way the Jazz aspire to play. Mitchell drove the lane and passed the ball to Bogdanovic, who moved it to Royce ONeale and around the 3-point line to Ingles, who found Mitchell in the corner for an open 3. If the ball can stay moving like that and the way the teams constructed, it gives a lot of guys opportunity. Thats the way we want to play, Snyder said. The Jazz had 27 assists on their 42 field goals, and four starters had four or more. TIP-INS Magic: Michael Carter-Williams got a taunting technical after stealing the ball from Ingles, and then Clifford got one for arguing the call.  The Magic challenged a loose-ball foul in the fourth quarter, but the call was upheld.  Orlando committed just three turnovers, which set a season low and tied a franchise record. Utah had 14. Jazz: Ingles hit a 3 just before the first-quarter buzzer and stared down Carter-Williams for several seconds with a wry smile.  Career assists and steals leader John Stockton attended the game and received a standing ovation when he was shown on the video board.  Gobert finished with 12 points and 19 rebounds, his 19th consecutive double-double, as Utah outrebounded Orlando 58-41.","401161047"
"Max Kellerman states his reasons for wanting Kawhi Leonard on his team over LeBron James at this point in the season. (1:48) LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Clippers are one player short of finally fielding their entire team. And it can't come too soon for Paul George and Kawhi Leonard. George scored 24 points, Leonard added 20 and the Clippers returned home after two weeks away to beat the Phoenix Suns 120-99 on Tuesday night.

We can see what our rotation is."" The Clippers went 4-2 on their recent road trip, which matched their longest of the season. Leonard didn't play in the finale, a loss Saturday at Chicago. But he came back strong at Staples Center, teaming with George in a dominant third quarter that saw the Clippers stretch their lead from five points to 21 by the time it was over. The two superstars combined to score 18 points in a 32-16 run that sent the Clippers into the fourth leading 90-69. We just couldn't figure out the Clippers' zone,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. We were a bit tired, playing in three time zones in four days. Our starting group just passed it around and was hoping for something to happen."" Lou Williams added 20 points for the Clippers, scoring their first 11 of the fourth -- including three 3-pointers. When he gets it going there is no shot that he can't make,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. That was a good stretch for us.

As a team, however, the Suns had 30 assists, their 11th straight game with 29 or more, which made them the first team to do so since Charlotte went 13 straight games from March 30 to April 23, 1989.","401161048"
"CLEVELAND --  Terry Rozier was stunned as he set up to take a shot that would have capped a huge comeback for the Charlotte Hornets. Rozier, who almost single-handedly brought the Hornets back from a 24-point deficit, missed a wide-open 3-pointer with three seconds left and the Cleveland Cavaliers hung on for a 100-98 win Wednesday night. ""It was crazy I was so open,"" he said. ""I couldn't believe it. I was so open for the last couple shots. It would have been good to get this one. It stinks that I missed it."" Rozier scored 19 of his career-high 35 points in the fourth quarter, including five 3s, as the Hornets nearly dealt the Cavaliers a crushing defeat after Cleveland led the entire game and was ahead 67-43 early in the third. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, who had his feet in a bucket of ice while sitting at his locker after the game, knew what his reaction would have been if Rozier's shot had gone in. ""I probably would have dumped this ice on my head and then left,"" he said. Collin Sexton scored 23 points and Cedi Osman had 18 for Cleveland, which had lost 16 of 18. Rozier's 3-pointer with 21 seconds remaining cut the deficit to 100-98. Sexton dribbled the ball off his foot and out of bounds with 16 seconds left. Rozier, thanks to a strong screen set by Cody Zeller, popped open at the top of the key, but the shot hit off the rim and Sexton grabbed the rebound to finally secure the victory for the Cavs. Cavaliers coach John Beilein said a defensive breakdown led to Rozier being so open on the last play. ""We missed a switch, so we were not in a position for the next switch,"" Beilein said. ""Rozier was just terrific. There were a couple tough shots, but a couple where we just got lost."" Rozier was 12 of 27 from the field and 7 of 15 on 3s. Zeller had 15 points for the Hornets. Love had 16 points and 14 rebounds for Cleveland. Tristan Thompson added 14 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland's biggest lead came on Darius Garland's 3-pointer, but Charlotte heated up from the field and cut into the margin. Rozier scored seven points, including a 3 at the third-quarter buzzer that trimmed the margin to 76-64. The Hornets continued to slice into their deficit in the fourth. Rozier and Devonte' Graham hit 3s on consecutive possessions, cutting it to 84-74. Charlotte, which defeated Sacramento at home on Tuesday, looked like a team on a back-to-back to start the game. The Cavaliers made 14 of 25 shots in the first quarter and led by 12. Cleveland controlled the first half despite not attempting a free throw. Charlotte committed four fouls before halftime. The Cavaliers finally got to the foul line less than a minute into the third quarter as Osman was fouled while scoring on a fast break, but missed the free throw. Osman had a highlight-reel defensive play when he chased down Marvin Williams and blocked his layup attempt in the third. Sexton made his first eight shots and was 10 of 14 from the field. TIP-INS Hornets: F Nicolas Batum missed his fifth straight game. He's still feeling discomfort in his left hand after breaking a finger in the season opener. ... G Mailk Monk bruised his left hip in the first half and didn't return. Cavaliers: G Kevin Porter Jr. played with protective padding on a sore left shoulder. He took a lob pass from Garland and slammed home a dunk with his right hand in the first quarter. ... Sexton made his 100th career start, joining LeBron James and Kyrie Irving as the only players in franchise history to do so before turning 21. CLEVELAND ROCKS Rozier was born in Youngstown and played high school basketball at Shaker Heights, which is 7 miles from downtown Cleveland. He said he had about 40 family members and friends in attendance. ""It was in my city,"" Rozier said. ""No matter what happens, it's my city. I could play better basketball, but I had a lot of people who are special to me here.""","401161049"
"DETROIT --  The Toronto Raptors beat Detroit but lost two more players in the process. ""A win with a heavy price,"" coach Nick Nurse said. Kyle Lowry had 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for a triple-double and the Raptors had an 11-0 run in the third quarter on their way to a 112-99 victory over the Pistons on Wednesday night. By the time the game ended, however, Toronto was short a few key players after Marc Gasol and Norman Powell left with injuries. The Raptors were without guard Fred VanVleet because of right knee injury. Then Gasol left in the first quarter with a left hamstring strain. With 3:17 left in the fourth, Powell departed holding onto his left shoulder. ""Don't know much,"" Nurse said. ""We've got to check them both tomorrow."" Toronto still had enough firepower to handle the Pistons. Detroit allowed 133 points in a loss to Washington on Monday night. The Pistons got frontcourt standouts Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond back from injuries for this game, but they still allowed 70 points in the first half and 40 in the second quarter. ""You never want to give up that many points, but I liked our start, I liked our effort and I like the competitive edge,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""If we can keep that up, we can build on that, but that's still one of the best teams in our league."" Lowry fed Serge Ibaka for a dunk with 37.4 seconds left for the assist he needed for a triple-double. That was a nice accomplishment, but now the defending champions will have to find out the extent of their latest injuries. ""We avoided the injury bug last year, and that really helped us throughout the whole year,"" Lowry said. ""It's pretty tough for our team, but we've got a bunch of guys that have to step up now, and hopefully it's nothing serious with those two guys."" Lowry already missed time this season with a thumb injury, and Ibaka was sidelined with a sprained ankle. Toronto led 81-76 before its 11-point run in the third. Pascal Siakam and Ibaka had back-to-back dunks that made it 90-76, and a layup by Rondae Hollis-Jefferson pushed the lead to 16. Drummond had 22 points and 18 rebounds for Detroit. TESTY As is often the case so close to the Canadian border, there was a divided crowd of Pistons fans and Raptors supporters. The action on the court was contentious at times as well. There were four technical fouls handed out: Lowry, Siakam and Drummond received theirs in the second quarter, and Griffin got one in the third. DRY SPELL Detroit came into the game shooting 38.5% from beyond the arc, but the Pistons went just 6 of 35 on Wednesday. ""They did a good job of contesting our shots, but so do other teams,"" said Luke Kennard, who was the only Detroit player to make more than one 3-pointer. ""We usually knock some of those down, but we've had other nights like this."" TIP-INS Raptors: Siakam scored 26 points and Ibaka added 25. Siakam was 6 of 11 from 3-point range. Pistons: F/C Christian Wood left the game with a left knee strain. He scored six points. ... Detroit was not called for a foul in the first quarter until Svi Mykhailiuk committed one with 4.5 seconds left.","401161050"
"WASHINGTON --  Chicago Bulls forward Zach LaVine offered blunt advice to teammates as they rallied against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. ""It just seemed like a real ugly game,"" LaVine said. ""I just kept telling them, `Hey, man it's an ugly game, might as well get ugly with them."" It worked. Wendell Carter Jr. made a layup with 9.1 seconds left in overtime, completing the Bulls' comeback from an 18-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Wizards 110-109. LaVine capped a 21-3 Bulls run with three free throws that tied the game at 96 with 5.5 seconds left in the fourth. Bradley Beal hit a jumper with 0.5 seconds remaining to put Washington ahead 98-96, but LaVine was fouled on the ensuing inbound play and hit two free throws to force OT. ""It showed that our identity should be like that for the rest of the year,"" former Wizards player Tomas Satoransky said. ""We won thanks to our defense."" Lauri Markkanen's alley-oop basket gave the Bulls their first lead since the first quarter, 106-105 with 1:47 left in overtime. Beal's two free throws put Washington back on top, and Isaiah Thomas' two foul shots made it 109-106 with 53 seconds left. Carter, aided by a lane violation by Washington, made two free throws with 40 seconds to go and scored the winner after Beal's miss. Beal missed another jumper at the buzzer. ""Felt good,"" Beal said. ""I got an open shot over a small defender. It was just short."" Markkanen had 31 points and nine rebounds, and LaVine added 24 points. Davis Bertans led Washington with 26 points, and Beal finished with 22 on 4-of-19 shooting from the field. The Wizards led 93-75 with 8:21 left in the fourth before Carter's dunk started Chicago's spurt. LaVine's 3-pointer pulled the Bulls within 96-93 with 1:33 remaining. LaVine scored 10 points in the final three minutes of the period. ""Just didn't execute like we did to get us the lead and I think that hurt us."" Thomas said. ""We played like we were stalling, playing against the shot clock and hoping to make the shot at the end of the shot clock."" In his return to Washington, Satoransky had 17 points. Washington led by six at halftime, and Beal and Thomas combined for three 3-pointers in a 9-2 run that gave the Wizards a 74-61 lead midway through the third quarter. STARTING THEM UP Chicago's reserves were outscored by Washington's bench 35-14. ""Trying to find a lineup that would work, that could get some juice going, and we went back with our starters. ... They battled, they made simple plays, they hung in there,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said after his starting five all played 34 minutes or more. WELCOME TO THE SHOW The Wizards signed Anzejs Pasecniks to a two-way contract this week, and the 7-foot-1 center made his NBA debut against the Bulls, finishing with nine points and nine rebounds. Pasecniks, who turns 24 on Friday, had been playing with the Wizards G-League team. ""He was terrific,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""He's big at the basket, pretty good hands. He knows how to play, makes good passes, makes good reads, and he is only going to get better."" TIP-INS Bulls: Satoransky was the subject of a video tribute during the first quarter. ... Carter picked up a flagrant foul in the fourth quarter. He had nine points and nine rebounds. ... The Bulls have seven straight games with at least five blocks. ... Chicago has won three straight versus Washington for the first time since a seven-game streak from April 2, 2010-Jan. 30, 2012. Wizards: Bertans started in place of rookie Rui Hachimura, who injured his groin in Monday's win at Detroit and is out for at least five games. ... The 13-point fourth quarter was their lowest-scoring quarter of the season.","401161051"
"Stephen A. Smith gives high praise to the Heat as he says they have the potential to make it to the Eastern Conference finals. (1:43) PHILADELPHIA --  Perfect home record at stake, a game down to the wire, and the Philadelphia 76ers sure could have used Jimmy Butler in the clutch, just like he was for them so many times last season. The Heat were glad to have the All-Star on their side -- and Butler did enough to help spoil the Sixers' perfect home record. Kendrick Nunn scored 26 points and Bam Adebayo had 23 to help the Miami Heat hand the 76ers their first home loss of the season, 108-104 on Wednesday night. Butler and the Heat won their 20th game, and perhaps proved they're more than a one-man show. ""This is a team of one star?"" Butler asked incredulously. ""Who's our star, Bam? I'll take it. I'll take Bam as our star any day. I ain't worried about what anybody says. We're content with who we are."" The 76ers had been 14-0 at home, including a 113-86 victory over the Heat last month. They came within a late bucket or two of staying flawless in Philly. Tobias Harris buried a 3-pointer for the Sixers with 25.5 seconds left that made it 106-104 and they had sudden life when Nunn missed twice at the free throw line. Al Horford, though, missed an open 3-point attempt from the wing and the Heat escaped in a thriller. Duncan Robinson had 15 for the Heat and hit a pair of 3s in the fourth that stretched the lead to 14 points. Nunn buried a 30-footer for a 99-83 lead that should have been enough of a cushion for Miami. Joel Embiid, who missed Sunday's rout by the Nets with an upper respiratory illness, had 22 points and 19 rebounds. Harris scored 20 points and the Sixers struggled to get going until late against Miami's 2/3 zone that put them on their heels. ""We weren't making shots and when you're not making shots, especially when a team is playing zone, they're going to keep on doing it,"" Embiid said. ""They did it all game and that's how they won the game."" Butler scored 14 points for the Heat and was pretty much a non-factor until late in his second game back in Philadelphia. Butler was soundly booed the first few times he touched the ball and continued to get jeers throughout the game. He played 55 regular-season games for the Sixers last season, averaging 18.2 points after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last November. He helped Philadelphia beat Brooklyn in the first round of the playoffs before the 76ers were eliminated in the second round by Toronto. Butler left Philadelphia in the offseason, signing a $142 million, four-year deal with the Heat in a sign-and-trade that brought Josh Richardson to Philadelphia. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Butler has been a perfect fit for a team trying to return to the playoffs after missing them last season. ""I feel like I've coached a lot of guys like Jimmy that are adults, that are very serious about winning, about the process of winning,"" he said. ""Ultra competitive. He's a max player. We wanted a max player, someone that would fit our culture and our system."" Richardson did his part late, hitting a 3 that made it an eight-point game and one more that made it 101-97 and sent another packed house into a frenzy. With a perfect home start still within reach, the 76ers coughed up the ball to Miami -- and Butler crushed them with an assist on a 3 from Derrick Jones Jr. that gave the Heat needed breathing room. Butler sank two free throws with 33.9 seconds left, toying with the 76ers to the end. ""I don't think we had a sting to our defense,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""What did they have, four 3s with a second left? Sometimes it's just not your night. There were times they were hurling up shots at the end of the clock, one of which was a bank shot, you feel like maybe it's going to be a long night."" TIP-INS Heat: The Heat went on a 27-7 run to close the first half and seemingly put the game away. The Heat stymied with the Sixers with the zone defense that helped them bust the game open. ""It was by any means necessary,"" Spoelstra said. ""We're only playing eight guys. We probably would have gotten into a lot of foul trouble if we just stayed with our man. We still trust it. We'll have to do both, obviously."" 76ers: Butler struck a friendship with Embiid and remained a fan of the All-Star center. ""That dude, he's real,"" Butler said. ""He does everything well. He's a true generational talent."" HE SAID IT ""Gregg Popovich and Pat Riley."" Brown on how to build a generational franchise like San Antonio and Miami.","401161052"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry let out a sigh of relief after being asked the first question in his postgame news conference. Gentry and the Pelicans could finally enjoy discussing a game. Brandon Ingram scored 34 points and New Orleans snapped its 13-game losing streak with a 107-99 win against the short-handed Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. Jrue Holiday had 18 points and Lonzo Ball added 10 points, six rebounds and six assists off the bench for the Pelicans, who were coming off a 108-101 overtime loss at home to Brooklyn a night earlier. ""We were tired, but I thought we just kind of grinded it out,"" Gentry said. ""We talked about playing blue-collar desperate. We had to be the most desperate team, not just in this game tonight, but the most desperate team in the league."" Playing without leading scorer and rebounder Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota lost its seventh straight game after shooting 38% from the field. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 27 points. While the Pelicans traveled, Minnesota was rested. The Wolves last played on Friday, a loss at home to the Los Angeles Clippers, and used the time off to practice three times. ""We had four days off, they're on a back-to-back, but you would think it was the other way around if you watched the game,"" Wiggins said. ""They played harder than us. They got more of the loose balls. They played like they wanted it more."" Minus the injured Towns, Minnesota continued to struggle despite altering its starting lineup. The Wolves led 7-0 early before Ingram started to carry New Orleans. Ingram made seven of his first 10 shots and scored 18 of New Orleans' first 30 points. The Pelicans took control by finishing the second quarter on an 18-8 run, with Ingram scoring seven during the stretch. Minnesota closed within eight in the fourth but got no closer. ""It feels good to get a win,"" Ingram said. ""I don't think we talked about the streak much. I think we just talked about staying together. I think in the last few games, we just didn't close them out, but we played really, really good defensively to be able to win basketball games."" While New Orleans was able to enjoy snapping its skid, the Wolves must deal with theirs being extended. ""When you lose games, it's heavy, especially in a streak,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""I liked what we did the last couple days in practice. I know we felt good about those things. It didn't translate tonight."" INGRAM'S DEVELOPMENT Ingram continues his rise in his first season with New Orleans. With rookie Zion Williamson missing the entire season so far after knee surgery, Ingram has been the primary offensive option. In three seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Ingram averaged 13.9 points, 2.0 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game. Entering play Wednesday, he led the Pelicans with 24.9 points per game while chipping in 3.6 assists and 7.1 rebounds. The 34 points on Wednesday were six off his career high set in November. ""He really wants to be a great player,"" Gentry said. ""He continues to work on his defense. He continues to work on expanding his game from a 3-point shooting standpoint because he's really dedicated to becoming a great player."" MISSING TOWNS Towns was held out because of a left knee sprain and Saunders called the big man day-to-day with the injury. It's the first game this season Towns has missed due to injury. He sat out two games after being suspended for an altercation with Philadelphia's Joel Embiid. Towns had 39 points and 12 rebounds in the previous game. In the fourth quarter, he went down hard after a missed dunk while being guarded by Montrezl Harrell. TIP-INS Pelicans: The 18 points in the first quarter and 25 in the first half were career highs for Ingram in a quarter and half. ... Holiday made three 3-pointers and became the Pelicans' career leader with 556, surpassing Peja Stojakovic. ... New Orleans held an opponent under 100 points for the first time this season. . E'Twaun Moore played 18 minutes and scored seven points in his first action since Dec. 3. Timberwolves: Robert Covington didn't start for disciplinary reasons after Saunders said Covington arrived late. He came off the bench for the first time this season and scored 15 points. Minnesota was also without starter Jarrett Culver because of flu-like symptoms. Gorgui Dieng started for Towns and had 13 points and eight rebounds. Jeff Teague and Treveon Graham also started in place of Culver and Covington.","401161053"
"Chris Paul treats his Thunder teammates to custom tailored suits, which they all wore before Oklahoma City's win against Memphis. (0:48) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Dennis Schroder scored 31 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 24-point deficit and beat the Memphis Grizzlies 126-122 on Wednesday night. Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each scored 20 points and Chris Paul added 18 for the Thunder, who rallied from 26 points down to beat the Chicago Bulls on Monday. Brandon Clarke scored 27 points, Jonas Valanciunas scored 24 and Ja Morant added 22 for the Grizzlies. The Thunder got off to another shaky start on Wednesday. Memphis shot 54% in the first half and took a 68-59 lead at the break. Valanciunas and Morant each scored 13 points for the Grizzlies while Gallinari scored 11 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City did not score for three minutes to start the third quarter, and Memphis took an 80-59 lead. The Grizzlies' largest lead was 89-65. The Thunder surged at the end of the third quarter. Abdel Nader hit a 3-pointer with nine seconds left, then Schroder stole the inbound pass and Gilgeous-Alexander hit a 16-footer at the buzzer to cut Oklahoma City's deficit to 100-93. Oklahoma City finally took the lead on a pull-up jumper by Schroder with just over eight minutes to play. Paul's short jumper gave the Thunder a 122-120 lead in the final minute. Memphis could have tied the game, but Morant and Clarke missed in close and Schroder made two free throws at the other end for Oklahoma City to push the Thunder lead to four.

"Chiney Ogwumike breaks down the Celtics' improved chemistry this season, saying Kemba Walker is a good complement to Jayson Tatum. (0:59) DALLAS --  The Boston Celtics turned to a new Big Three to earn a key road win. Kemba Walker scored 32 points and combined with teammates Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for 82 as the Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks 109-103 on Wednesday night. Brown had 26 points and Tatum added 24 to help Boston prevail on a night when both teams were missing key players and struggled to shoot 40% from the field. The trio combined for 27 of the Celtics' 33 points in the final quarter when Boston pulled away from a Mavericks team missing star guard Luka Doncic. Boston had injuries of its own, playing without Gordon Hayward (left foot soreness) and Marcus Smart (left eye infection). No other Celtics player scored more than seven points. ""The three guys we were going to play through were very clear tonight,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""Those guys all had good scoring nights, thankfully."" Doncic sat out his second straight game with a right ankle sprain, and his absence was felt more than in Dallas' win Monday over Milwaukee. The Mavs scored a season-low 18 points in the third quarter and finished 15 points below their season average despite hitting a flurry of 3-pointers in the final minutes. Kristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 23 points and 13 rebounds but fouled out in the last minute. Seth Curry added 20 points. Jalen Brunson started at point guard in place of Doncic and tied his career high with 11 assists, but struggled with 4-for-13 shooting and had two crucial turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""Most importantly, I've got to stop turning the ball over so late in the game,"" Brunson said. ""Two straight home games turning the ball over late -- that's on me."" After falling behind early in each of the first three quarters before rallying, Boston jumped out front in the fourth with Brown hitting a 20-footer and Tatum a 3 to build an 83-78 lead. Tatum converted a three-point play with 6:38 to go to give the Celtics an 88-80 edge. After two Dallas free throws, Walker hit a 3 and then made four free throws in a row to extend the lead to double digits. ""Our development together is getting better,"" Walker said. ""Chemistry's getting better each and every day."" Dallas hit five 3s in the final 3:34 to trim the deficit. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said Hayward had soreness in his foot since before the broken hand that cost him 13 games. Hayward didn't feel better at practice this week despite a cortisone shot last Friday, and he will undergo an MRI on Thursday. . Smart missed his fourth game in a row. Mavericks: Coach Rick Carlisle said Doncic was improving and would join the team on its two-game road trip to Philadephia and Toronto, but said it was ""highly unlikely"" he would play in either game. HOME WOES Dallas is 18-9 but only 8-7 at home and has lost four of its last six at American Airlines Center, despite announcing its 800th consecutive sellout, including playoffs. ""Sometimes we start a little bit slow and we have to fight our way back,"" Porzingis said. ""Tonight we didn't come out with the same aggression or the same intensity that we did in Milwaukee."" START STRONG, FINISH STRONG Walker did nearly all his damage in the first and fourth quarters, with 16 and 13 points, respectively. In between, Dallas largely used top defender Dorian Finney-Smith to check Walker, which opened up opportunities for Tatum and Brown. ""Those guys just make it easy for me,"" Walker said. ""Whenever I'm missing, they always come up to me and keep me confident. That's especially important for me, being the new guy.""","401161055"
"DENVER --  Jamal Murray knew Denver was scoring at a nice clip and getting some timely stops in the third quarter. To the tune of a 24-0 run? Now that caught him by surprise. ""I mean,"" Murray said, ""I didn't even realize it."" Paul Millsap started the pivotal stretch and Murray helped keep it going as the Nuggets rallied for a 113-104 win over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. For more than six minutes, the Nuggets kept scoring and scoring on one end and making stop after stop on the other. Sure, the scores were nice, but the stops were what immensely pleased Nuggets coach Michael Malone. ""No doubt in my mind the defense was able to fuel the offense and the guys got into a rhythm,"" Malone said. ""We never gave up."" Murray finished with 33 points, including 13 in that third quarter. Millsap scored 14 of his 15 points during the third in his return from a strained quadriceps. Even more, Millsap rattled off Denver's first 12 points of the second half and launched the game-altering run. Trailing 69-50 with 9:18 left in the third, the Nuggets stormed back. By the time the pivotal quarter was over, Denver had an 84-76 lead and was on its way to an eighth straight win over the Magic. After the game, Malone's message to Millsap was simple -- welcome back. ""Guys just want to win,"" said Millsap, who also had 12 rebounds as he returned after missing two games. ""We weren't really ourselves in the first half. It was sloppy. ... Second half, we know what our staple is and that's on the defensive end. We got some stops and got out and ran."" Nikola Jokic added 18 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds. After the decisive run by Denver, the Magic regained their composure and sliced it to 98-96 with 4:30 remaining. But Murray hit a fade-away and a 3-pointer to extend the lead. ""We did a good job of handling their runs, especially in the fourth,"" Murray said. For a half, the Magic looked like the more energetic team despite a seven-point loss in Utah on Tuesday. They ran out of steam after halftime. Orlando went 5 of 23 from the floor in the third quarter. The Magic also lost their cool in the quarter, too, with coach Steve Clifford and guard D.J. Augustin each drawing technical fouls. ""We couldn't make shots and we got good looks. We let it affect our defense,"" said Nikola Vucevic, who scored 20 points. ""We let our heads drop and it cost us."" Orlando erupted for 60 points in the opening half against the defensive-minded Nuggets, who entered allowing a league-low 101.7 points per game. There was a comical moment early in the first quarter when Murray tried to tip the ball away from a defender and accidentally knocked it into the Magic hoop. Vucevic happened to be in the vicinity and received credit for the basket. Murray just stared in disbelief for a moment. He knows that could end up on TNT analyst Shaquille O'Neal's ""Shaqtin a Fool"" segment. ""I was just trying to tip it to myself,"" Murray explained. ""I tipped it too hard."" TIP-INS Magic: Fell to 1/3 on the second night of a back-to-back this season. ... F Aaron Gordon picked up a technical late in the fourth. ... Augustin had 18 points. ... F Jonathan Isaac experienced some tightness in his hamstring. He played 17 minutes and had seven points. ""I don't think anything is hurt,"" he said. ""I just wanted to take it easy."" Nuggets: Murray was 9 of 10 from the free throw line. WHAT'S IN A NAME The spelling of their first names may be the same, but the pronunciation remains vastly different between Denver's Nikola (ni-KOLA) and Orlando's Nikola (KNEE-coal-uh). It was quite an entertaining showdown between the two big men. Jokic finished a rebound shy of his 33rd career triple-double. FAN OF FULTZ Count Malone as a big fan of Markelle Fultz. Malone appreciates the guard's ability to make the most of his opportunity in Orlando after being a No. 1 pick by Philadelphia. ""I root for kids like that,"" Malone said. ""What he went through I'm sure wasn't easy for him."" REST BREAK As a coach, Malone is exhausted following a recent stretch that included eight games in 12 days. ""If I'm this tired, imagine how our players are,"" he said. That's why Malone's managing their court time by nixing shootarounds. ""There are a lot of ways to approach load management,"" Malone said.","401161056"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Portland Trail Blazers aren't concerned about style points. A mid-December win was enough -- tight as it felt against the team with the NBA's worst record. Damian Lillard had 31 points and a season-high 13 assists, Hassan Whiteside grabbed 23 rebounds and the Trail Blazers beat the Golden State Warriors 122-112 Wednesday night. CJ McCollum scored 30 points and Carmelo Anthony added 17 for Portland. Whiteside also scored 16 points. ""Tonight was just one of those nights,"" Anthony said. ""It was a physical game, a game that we had to win no matter what. We did that. We need to find a groove, just a rhythm amongst the team and string some wins together."" After starting the season 4-8, Portland is 12-16 and only a half-game back of the Sacramento Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference standings. ""It was an emotional roller coaster ride,"" McCollum said. ""We gave up a ton of offensive rebounds, lots of 3s in transition, but we tightened up in the fourth quarter. We did a better job of getting stops and running out."" McCollum, Anthony and Lillard combined for 78 points a game after combining for 80 in a win at Phoenix. Anthony thinks he's settling into his role as the team's third option. ""I'm just playing off of those guys,"" Anthony said. ""I'm letting them do what they do and I get to take advantage of what's left and the opportunities that's out there. That's all I've been doing."" D'Angelo Russell led Golden State with 26 points and seven assists. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was pleased with his team's effort. ""The effort was great, we did a lot of good things,"" Kerr said. ""I like the way we executed offensively, but we had too many breakdowns defensively."" Lillard set the tone in the first quarter. Going against the team he grew up rooting for, Lillard had 16 points and five assists in the opening quarter to help the Blazers build a 40-29 halftime lead. The Warriors still showed plenty of fight even though they entered Wednesday with the worst record in the NBA. After trailing by 13, the Warriors led 66-65 late in the first half after a 3-pointer by Eric Pascall. Golden State had a 27-11 advantage in second-chance points and went 16 for 38 from the 3-point line. A driving layup by Lillard got Portland a 67-66 lead heading into halftime. TIP-INS Warriors: While they now find themselves with the league's worst record at 5-23, Kerr believes the Warriors' youthful energy is helping an otherwise difficult year. ""This is basically a brand new group and I really love the young energy we have,"" Kerr said. ""These guys have been great in their willingness to learn and their eagerness to learn."" Trail Blazers: If there's one player who has struggled to find his footing with the Blazers after their signing of Anthony, it's Anfernee Simons. Only 20 years old, Simons is Portland's backup point guard but has struggled over the past month with his shot, shooting 36.3% from the field in the 14 games since Anthony joined. Lillard has often been in the gym after hours with Simons, telling him to trust in his work ethic. ""I tell him more than anything, just make sure you keep getting your work in,"" Lillard said. ""Keep getting your time in and you know everything will balance itself out and you'll come around. "" NEXT Warriors: Friday vs. New Orleans Pelicans.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo looked over at LeBron James and Anthony Davis and thought about his past. ""I wasn't supposed to be here,"" the 6-foot-11 Greek Freak said. Hardly looked that way Thursday night. Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 11 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks beat James, Davis and the Los Angeles Lakers 111-104 in a showdown of the NBA's top teams. The reigning MVP had seven assists and a career-best five 3-pointers as Milwaukee improved to 25-4 after ending an 18-game winning streak against Dallas on Monday night. ""I wasn't the No. 1 pick, AD was, LeBron was,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I wasn't supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to go up against these two beasts.

""You tip your hat off to him and we move forward,"" Davis said of Antetokounmpo. The Lakers dropped their second straight game and fell to 24-5 largely because their bench was outscored 34-4 by the Bucks' reserves. George Hill had 21 points off the bench for Milwaukee. The last time two teams that were 20 games over .500 played each other before Jan. 1 was 1980. The Boston Celtics (28-8) played the Suns (32-8) in Phoenix. Boston won 116-97. ""No matter what team we play,"" Hill said, ""we come in with the same mentality to get better that night on both ends of the floor, and it just happened to be the Lakers tonight."" Milwaukee led by six after the first quarter then opened the second with a 20-7 run. Davis and James combined to shoot 6 for 20 in the first half, and the Lakers had 10 turnovers. The Bucks led 65-46 at the break. Los Angeles outscored Milwaukee 68-46 in the second half to close the gap. The Lakers now head home after ending a five-game trip. ""We continue to build chemistry, we continue to build camaraderie,"" James said. ""Pretty much every time anyone does anything, we pretty much do it together on the road. Just kind of have that bunker mentality, that brotherhood when we hit the road."" The Bucks improved to 3-0 against the two teams from Los Angeles, including a dominant 119-91 win over the Clippers at home on Dec. 6. BROTHERLY Antetokounmpo, his older brother and teammate, Thanasis, and their younger brother Kostas, who plays for the Lakers, swapped jerseys and posed for photos together on the court after the game. ""This is unique,"" Giannis Antetokounmpo said. ""You can't take this for granted. Three brothers under the same roof, going through the same game, going through our pregame warmup. We're blessed."" TIP-INS Lakers: Kyle Kuzma remained out with a sore ankle. Coach Frank Vogel said he's hopeful the third-year forward will be able to practice fully Saturday and be available to play Sunday. Bucks: Milwaukee played its third game without guard Eric Bledsoe. The 2018-19 all-defensive first-team performer fractured his right leg against the Memphis Grizzles on Friday.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The last active player from the San Antonio Spurs glory days, Patty Mills remembers when winning wasn't such a struggle. Mills tells his teammates to stay positive, remain patient and keep fighting. On Thursday night, he showed them how to do it. Mills had 27 points and the Spurs overcame a career-high 41 points from Spencer Dinwiddie to beat the Brooklyn Nets 118-105. Weve just got to find ways to win, Mills said. A lot of it comes down to energy and effort. Were working out the kinks of being able to execute a lot more than we have. Were just grinding it, grinding it out and finding ways to win. Mills had 21 points in the second half, shooting 5 for 8 on 3-pointers as the Spurs rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat the Nets for the 17th straight home game. As tough as the defeat was, Brooklyn suffered a greater loss when David Nwaba suffered a season-ending torn right Achilles tendon. Nwaba left a minute into the fourth quarter after dropping to the court following a scramble for the ball near the top of the key. Its tough to focus on the game right now, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. He was playing as well as anybody on our team. Tough blow. Thats where our hearts and minds are right now. Already without Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert, Brooklyn played its 17th straight game without injured point guard Kyrie Irving. Dinwiddie tried to cover by shooting 14 of 29 from the field, eclipsing his career high by two points. LaMarcus Aldridge was playing the lob a lot, Dinwiddie said. You just try to be aggressive because hes trying to take away (Jarrett Allen) and theyre trying to take away shooters. If they went under, I shot a 3. If they went over, I attacked the basket. The strategy helped the Nets build a 14-point lead in the first half. The Spurs closed the third quarter on a 12-0 run and notched their first lead at 83-81 on Mills layup with 3.8 seconds left. San Antonio was 4 for 9 on 3-pointers in the third, including Derrick Whites 3 to tie it at 81. Mills finished 7 for 10 on 3-pointers. Hes everything, Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray said. Ive never seen him with an attitude in the four years Ive been here. Not an attitude, no head down. Hes a real pro. The Nets never trailed in the first half while the Spurs plodded along. San Antonio committed nine turnovers and shot 40% from the field in the first half. Brooklyn opened the game on a 12-2 run, including two emphatic dunks by Allen. The second slam came off an uncontested drive that prompted a timeout by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich 3 minutes into the game. Allen finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds. Aldridge added 20 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio. TIP-INS Nets: Irving did not travel with the team on its two-game road trip as he battles a right shoulder impingement. Atkinson said there is no update on Irvings injury status. Brooklyn is 11-6 in Irvings absence. Spurs: Former Nets F DeMarre Carroll did not play for the 16th time due to a coachs decision. Carroll is averaging 2.5 points and 10.9 minutes in 11 games since signing with San Antonio as a free agent. FUTURE HALL OF FAMERS San Antonio assistants Tim Duncan and Becky Hammon were both nominated for enshrinement into The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Popovich said he expects both to enter the Hall, but Duncans admission comes with a caveat. Popovich joked that his vote would depend on if the Spurs can turn things around with Duncan as an assistant.","401161060"
"Russell Westbrook reacts to getting a technical foul for waving off Patrick Beverley, who was ejected from the game. (0:28) LOS ANGELES --  Russell Westbrook has had his share of big games at Staples Center in front of family and friends. The Houston Rockets All-Star guard had one of the best outings of his career Thursday night. The Lawndale native and former UCLA standout scored 40 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the Rockets rallied for a 122-117 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. ""It's fun to come in here and get a big win, but the win is the main thing,"" Westbrook said. It is the most points Westbrook has scored in 45 NBA games at Staples and his 12th with 30 or more. It is also the 44th 40-point game of his 11-year career, which ties him with Karl Malone for 22nd on the career list. ""When you give so much attention to (James) Harden you forget the other MVP that is on their team,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""You have to respect him and play him the right way. We lost our discipline a lot on him tonight, especially in transition. Once he gets in front of you, you're not going to catch him, and that happened a lot during the second half."" Westbrook is the first Rocket other than Harden to have a 40-point game since Kevin Martin scored 45 against Portland on Jan. 5, 2011. He is also the first Houston player besides Harden to have consecutive games with 30 or more points since Jeremy Lin in 2013. Houston rallied from a large deficit for the second straight game. It was down 16 three minutes into the third quarter before coming back to take the lead at the end of the quarter. The Rockets trailed by 25 on Monday night against San Antonio before winning by two, marking the largest comeback in franchise history. The Rockets -- who have won two of three against the Clippers this season -- are 7-6 when trailing by double digits this season. Westbrook scored 14 points during a wild fourth quarter that saw both teams lead by at least six. The Rockets led by three at the start of the quarter before extending it to 101-89. Los Angeles went on a spurt of its own to lead 113-107 with 4:29 left. The Rockets closed on a 15-4 run to snap the Clippers' 10-game home winning streak. Harden scored nine of his 28 points during the final six minutes, including a 3-pointer with 2:57 remaining to put the Rockets up for good at 116-113. ""We kept plugging and the difference in the final 3 minutes was that James hit a few daggers and took his game to a higher level,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""(PJ Tucker's) defense on (Kawhi) Leonard was unbelievable and Russ was really good out there all night."" Paul George led the Clippers with 34 points and Leonard added 25. Los Angeles shot 56.7% from the field during the first half (27 of 48) but made just 41% (16 of 39) over the final 24 minutes. Clippers guard Patrick Beverley had yet another tense night against Westbrook and was ejected with 2:52 remaining after receiving his second technical. Westbrook was also given a technical for taunting Beverley as he left the floor. ""We had a chance to knock them out and we didn't,"" Rivers said. ""In the fourth quarter our problem was more of our composure. I just thought we lost it as a team. It happens. It shouldn't, but this is a good learning lesson for us."" The Clippers led by 15 at halftime and extended their lead to 77-61 three minutes into the third quarter before the Rockets went on a 14-2 run. They scored nine of the last 10 points in the period to lead 90-87 going into the fourth. ""We lost that aggression in the third quarter that we started the game with and that was it,"" George said. ""Russ made some big shots when James was struggling and he was ultra aggressive."" MILESTONE George grabbed his 4,000th career rebound during the second quarter. He is one of 10 active players that has at least 12,000 points, 4,000 rebounds, 2,000 assists and 1,000 steals. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden recorded 10 assists and has 4,412 with Houston, passing Calvin Murphy (4,402) for the most in franchise history. Clippers: Lou Williams was ejected with 11:05 remaining in the fourth quarter after receiving two technicals for arguing a foul. It is the second ejection of Williams' 14-year career. ...

"Kevin Love shares his reaction to almost getting posterized by rookie Ja Morant. (1:02) CLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Cavaliers didn't panic when faced with a 12-point deficit early in the fourth quarter. Instead, the Cavaliers rallied to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-107 on Friday night, winning back-to-back games for the second time this season. Jordan Clarkson scored a season-high 33 points, and Kevin Love hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with just over a minute to play. ""We had a deficit, but we were able to fight back,"" said Love, who had another 3-pointer earlier in the quarter. ""We knew we had to get this one on our home floor."" Love's clutch shot gave the Cavaliers a 109-107 lead with 1:03 left. Collin Sexton made three free throws and rookie Darius Garland added two to put the game away. Clarkson hit 12 of 17 shots, including 6 of 8 3-pointers. Love had 21 points, including five 3-pointers, and 13 rebounds. There was a point in the fourth quarter where I didn't think we'd be sitting up here with a W,' Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""I love the way we fought back."" Jaren Jackson led Memphis with 24 points while Dillon Brooks scored 16, but the Grizzlies took their second straight tough loss. Memphis failed to hold a 24-point third-quarter lead against Oklahoma City on Wednesday. ""A disappointing loss, given the lead we had,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Credit the Cavs for coming back in the fourth."" Rookie Ja Morant matched a season low with eight points. His basket with 1:23 left put Memphis ahead 107-106, but the Grizzlies didn't score again. The game had 25 lead changes and was tied 16 times. Grayson Allen's four-point play gave Memphis a 93-81 lead with 10:28 to play. He hit a 3-pointer from the corner and was fouled by Kevin Porter Jr. The call on Porter was upgraded to a flagrant foul, but Memphis failed to convert the extra possession and Cleveland quickly rallied. Clarkson scored five points and Tristan Thompson's rebound dunk cut the lead to 103-102. Love made one of two free throws with 3:15 left to tie the game and hit a 3-pointer with 2:50 left to give Cleveland a 106-103 lead. Memphis regained the lead on baskets by Jackson and Morant, who matched a season high with 11 assists. Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 14 rebounds. Morant, taken with the second pick in the draft, failed to reach double figures for only the third time in 23 games. He took blame for the defeat. ""The last minute I made a turnover and I missed a box out,"" he said. ""Put that loss on me. Ill take it. Cleveland also won consecutive games on Nov. 8-10 against Washington and New York. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Allen returned after missing five games because of a sore right ankle. He was hit with a technical for clapping in Porter's face after being fouled by Cleveland's rookie in the third quarter. Allen scored nine points in 11 minutes. ... The franchise is 4-19 on the road against the Cavaliers. Cavaliers: Garland had 14 points while Cedi Osman scored 13. ... Thompson had 10 points and 15 rebounds. He became the second player in franchise to reach 2,000 offensive rebounds in his career. Zydrunas Ilgauskas is first with 2,336. ROOKIE MEETS VET Morant took off in the lane and tried to dunk over Love in the first quarter, but the ball hit off the back of the rim and sailed toward the other end of the court. Morant's leg struck Love in the head and both players went to the floor. The 12-year veteran helped the first-year player to his feet as Cleveland scored on a fast break. Love joked that he might have asked for a medical retirement had Morant finished the play. ""Boy, I was so glad he missed that dunk,"" Love said. ""I looked back, I helped him up. That was my tip of the hat to him. That kid, he's really special and you gotta give credit where credit is due. He's going to continue to get better."" ""He was in the way,"" Morant said with a sly smile. ""You dont get any cool points if you miss it. I probably cocked it back too much because it hit the rim.""","401161062"
"Scottie Pippen is impressed by how the Pacers are playing without Victor Oladipo and sees them as a 2- or 3-seed when he returns. (1:33) INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan discussed the possibility of a trap game Friday night with Sacramento. The host Pacers beat Western Conference leader Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night and play at Eastern Conference leader Milwaukee on Sunday. However, there was no letdown, with T.J. Warren scoring 23 points to help the Pacers beat the Kings 119-105 for their fifth straight victory. ""We just had the same approach as we did against the Lakers,"" Warren said. ""We've just been following the game plan and excecute while we're on the floor, just continue to play hard, listen to the coaches and believe in ourselves."" Despite being ill, Warren sank 10 of 16 shots, 3 of 4 from 3-point range. ""I just wanted to come out and be aggressive,"" Warren said. Myles Turner added 17 points, and Domantas Sabonis and T.J. McConnell each had 15, with Sabonis also grabbing nine rebounds to help the Pacers improve to 20-9. McConnell hit 7 of 8 shots and had eight assists off the bench. Malcolm Brogdon and Doug McDermott had 13 points each, and Aaron Holiday had 11 in Indiana's balanced attack. ""Everyone is unselfish on this team so we know anyone can get going on any given night,"" McDermott said. ""We had a balanced attack out there and it's good to see. We're clicking right not but we have a really tough test against Milwaukee. We can't be complacent."" Richaun Holmes led the Kings with 20 points on 9-of-10 shooting and a team-high nine rebounds. Marvin Bagley III added 17 points, and Justin James had 14. ""I feel like they imposed their will on the game and we didn't respond,"" Holmes said. Buddy Hield, the Kings' leading scorer, was just 3 of 15 shots for seven points. He did contribute eight rebounds and a team-high six assists. The Pacers shot 64% in the first half to take a 68-57 lead. They finished at 52% The Kings made 53% in the first half and 45% overall ""We gave them too many easy looks in the first half and we just wanted to put a stop to that,"" McDermott said. Indiana led by 22 points in the third quarter before settling for a 92-79 lead entering the fourth. The Kings scored the last nine points of the third, with James hitting a long 3-pointer at the quarter buzzer. The Kings narrowed the deficit to 11 points at 91-81 before the Pacers pulled away again. ""In the first half, we didn't establish ourselves defensively and (the Kings) were playing in the paint,"" McMillan said. ""We did a better job in the second half defensively and we had good ball movement all game. I like our effort collectively."" TIP-INS Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic, who averages 14.6 points off the bench, was sidelined by right ankle soreness. Trevor Ariza was not with the team for personal reasons. Pacers: Jeremy Lamb (14 points per game) was out with a sore right groin injury. Aaron Holiday started in his place. DEFENSIVE WOES Sacramento coach Luke Walton saw too many defensive breakdowns. ""You talk about guarding our man and there's three or four possessions early where somebody just drove right past us into the paint,"" Walton said. ""When you do that at this level, you just put so much pressure on the rest of your defense. If you let your man just by you one-on-one, it's tough to get any stops."" BUCKS ON MIND Myles Turner knows the Pacers are headed for another test against Milwaukee. The Bucks won the season's first meeting 102-83 in Indianapolis. ""We know they're a top team and we have to respect them for that,"" Turner said. ""But we have to go with the mindset that we're going to punch first and, hopefully, leave there with a win.""

"BOSTON --  Even with Gordon Hayward out of the lineup and Kemba Walker having a tough shooting night, the Boston Celtics had more than enough offense against the struggling Detroit Pistons. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum each scored 26 points in only three quarters of work, and the Celtics rolled past the Pistons for a 114-93 victory Friday. ""There's a lot of versatility in scoring with those two,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""They can both put it on the ground. They can both get to the rim. They're both aggressive. They were really good tonight."" The short-handed Pistons helped the Celtics by turning the ball over 25 times. Boston also dominated inside, outscoring Detroit 58-34 in the paint and finishing with a 51-36 rebounding advantage. All 12 Boston players in the lineup scored at least two points and all but Walker, who went 0 for 6 from the floor, hit at least a pair of field goals. ""It wasn't Kemba's night, but everybody on our team contributed to winning,"" Stevens said. Walker still had 11 assists and a pair of free throws. The Celtics finished 45 for 86 from the floor while playing without Hayward (sore left foot) and Marcus Smart (left eye infection). Rookie Grant Williams added a career-high 18 points and Enes Kanter pulled down 18 rebounds. Rookie Tacko Fall finally made his home debut for the Celtics when Stevens answered fans' repeated chants of ""We want Tacko!"" midway through the fourth quarter. ""As the game was closing out, I knew I was getting in for sure,"" Fall said. ""Then it was just a matter of going out there and having some fun."" The Celtics had lots of fun, much of it at the expense of the Pistons. Detroit trailed just 28-26 entering the second quarter, but the Celtics started pulling away before halftime and continued throughout the third. The Pistons were missing Blake Griffin (sore left knee), Luke Kennard (bilateral knee soreness) and Christian Wood (left knee bruise). ""Our biggest nemesis was our turnovers. You're not going to beat a junior high team turning the ball over 25 times for 32 points,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""So that's the game right there."" Andre Drummond had 12 points and 11 rebounds for Detroit. Thon Maker added 15 points and seven rebounds, and Derrick Rose finished with 14 points. The Pistons lost for the fourth time in five games. ""We were in it, you know, in the first half,"" Maker said. ""We just have to continue to grow and take care of the ball like Coach always preaches. And we've just got to find a way to stay together and take care of the ball."" TACKO NIGHT As Boston continued to expand the lead in the third quarter, some Celtics fans started chanting ""We want Tacko!"" -- hoping for their first look at the 7-foot-5 center who had played in just one game this season. They got their wish with 4:31 left in the fourth. Fans roared when Fall got up from the bench and removed his warmups, and then replaced Kanter at center. He quickly committed a foul -- although the fans were certain it was a clean block. Fans altered the chant to ""M-V-P!"" when Fall went to the foul line with 52 seconds left and leaped to their feet when he put back an offense rebound with a dunk with 32 seconds to go. Fall finished with five points and two rebounds. PULLING AWAY The Pistons trimmed a 14-point lead down to six late in the second quarter, but Boston quickly regained control. Brown hit back-to-back 3-pointers, then another from beyond the arc while drawing a foul with 1.1 seconds left in the second quarter. Brown hit the free throw to help the Celtics to a 60-48 halftime lead. Boston kept up the pace in the third quarter, outscoring Detroit 31-21 while taking advantage of seven more turnovers by the Pistons. TIP-INS Pistons: Griffin was out for the second time in three games. ... Detroit came close to matching its season high of 29 turnovers from Oct. 28 against Indiana. Celtics: Kanter hadn't pulled down more than 13 rebounds in his first season with Boston. ... Williams' previous scoring high was 10 points against the Knicks on Nov. 1. ...

"TORONTO --  Serge Ibaka stepped into the starting lineup and helped the injury-riddled Raptors keep winning. Kyle Lowry scored 26 points, Ibaka had 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Toronto overcame the absence of three key players to beat the struggling Washington Wizards 122-118 on Friday night. Fred VanVleet returned from a five-game absence with 16 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, and OG Anunoby scored 18 as Toronto won its sixth straight over the Wizards. VanVleet said Ibaka, who started for the first time this season, has more talent than the typical NBA reserve. ""Serge is a starter,"" VanVleet said. ""He took that sacrifice to come off the bench for the betterment of our team, but he's still a starting-caliber big in this league, and a very good one at that."" Ibaka has recorded double-doubles in three of his past four games. ""He's feeling good about himself,"" Lowry said. ""We just need him to play at that level."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks had Ibaka on his roster for six seasons in Oklahoma City, and still has a fondness for the Congolese big man's intense style. ""He's as passionate and competitive and angry on the court as I've seen any player, and I love that about him,"" Brooks said of Ibaka. ""He's hard to guard, he's strong."" The Raptors won their third straight home game despite playing without leading scorer Pascal Siakam (groin), center Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and guard Norman Powell (left shoulder). ""Any win is tough in this league, especially when you're missing half your team,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Siakam and Gasol were the only two players to start each of Toronto's first 27 games. Powell had started 16 of the past 19, including 11 in place of Lowry while the five-time All-Star was recovering from an injured left thumb. VanVleet had missed Toronto's past five games because of a right knee contusion. ""I'd like to think that I increased our chances of winning tonight, regardless of how ugly it was,"" VanVleet said. Bradley Beal scored 37 points, Ish Smith had 26 and Isaiah Thomas scored 12 as the Wizards lost for the eighth time in 10 December games. ""I feel like we should have won,"" Beal said. ""We had enough flow and juice to win. Down the stretch, we kind of got away from ourselves. We weren't defending. They made some tough shots down the stretch, too."" Smith made all nine of his field-goal attempts, including four from 3-point range. He also shot 4 for 4 at the free throw line. ""I expect him not to miss tomorrow night, either,"" Brooks joked. The Wizards visit Philadelphia on Saturday. Beal shot 3 for 10 from 3-point range while teammate Davis Bertans went 2 for 12 from long range. Bertans finished with 10 points. Toronto led 96-85 to begin the final quarter, but Beal and Admiral Schofield made back-to-back 3-pointers to cut the deficit to two points, and Smith's 3-pointer with 5:21 to go tied it at 107-107. McCaw hit a tiebreaking 3 with 3:02 remaining and, after Beal missed a 3 that would have tied the score, Lowry answered with a 3 with 2:00 left, putting the Raptors up 116-110. Beal and Troy Brown Jr. each made baskets in the final 21 seconds to cut the deficit to two points, but VanVleet made four free throws down the stretch to preserve the win.

Miami's starters got the fourth quarter off. Dragic played 24 minutes after being sidelined for nine games. ""You need to get back and try to fit in again with the system,"" Dragic said. ""And I feel like I didn't miss any games."" Duncan Robinson scored 18 for Miami on 6-for-10 shooting from 3-point range. Kendrick Nunn scored 15, Derrick Jones Jr. had 14, Tyler Herro finished with 12 and Kelly Olynyk added 10 for the Heat. Miami led by as many by 34 and posted its sixth wire-to-wire win of the season. The Heat won easily and Jimmy Butler was called upon to take only three shots. Butler finished with nine points and eight assists in 28 minutes -- his third-lightest night of the season, and after a stretch where he averaged nearly 40 minutes in Miami's last nine games. ""Jimmy really facilitates a mindset for guys to grow because he's such a giving and unselfish player,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Bobby Portis came off New York's bench to lead the Knicks with 30 points on 12-for-17 shooting. Mitchell Robinson scored 18 points, Marcus Morris had 15, Julius Randle added 13 and Kevin Knox finished with 11. ""They were getting everything they wanted,"" Portis said. ""They were getting lobs at the rim, open 3s. This wasn't our best game defensively and they exposed us a little bit on the defensive end, but the best part about the NBA is we have a game tomorrow and we can go there and try to correct it."" It was the first meeting between the clubs since the Knicks fired coach David Fizdale and replaced him with interim coach Mike Miller. Fizdale is a former Heat assistant and a close friend of Spoelstra, who still is disappointed about New York's decision. ""They hired him to do a job,"" Spoelstra said. ""It takes time to build culture and build something, which we've done as well. It takes time. It takes a great deal of stability from the people you work for, which I'm so grateful we have here. I just think it stinks."" New York allowed the Heat to shoot 56 percent. ""They put a lot of pressure on our defense,"" Miller said. TIP-INS Knicks: RJ Barrett had only two points on 1-for-10 shooting. ... Reggie Bullock (cervical disk herniation) and former Heat guard Wayne Ellington (sore left Achilles) were ruled out. Allonzo Trier was questionable with concussion-like symptoms but played in the fourth quarter, logging 10 minutes. ...

Heat: Miami had assists on each of its first 20 field goals and finished with 34 assists on 43 baskets. Of the 10 Heat players who appeared, nine had multiple assists. ... Justise Winslow (strained lower back) missed his eighth consecutive game citing that issue and was unavailable for the 19th time in Miami's last 25 games overall. HELPING HAND Knicks assistant coach Kaleb Canales once sought a video internship with the Heat -- so he sent weekly letters to Spoelstra, a former Miami video-room guy himself, looking for help and advice. The Heat brought Canales in for an interview, but ultimately hired current Heat assistant Dan Craig instead. Spoelstra and Canales stayed in touch, and Canales eventually got an NBA job. ""He's relentless and he's been a friend,"" Spoelstra said. ONE-SIDED The Heat led 39-20 after one quarter and 70-47 at the half. Out of the 152 Heat-Knicks games all-time, including playoffs, those margins -- 19 points after one quarter, 23 at the break -- tied for the second-biggest leads Miami ever had over New York at that point in a game.","401161066"

""You never want to be without Luka, and we need him back as soon as possible,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""But as long as he's out, we have a plan and guys are executing well. We really played together and extremely well. If you're going to win in this building, you're going to have to fight and our guys did."" Porzingis put his inside-outside game on display again, reaching at least 20 points and 10 rebounds for the fourth straight contest. He said the Mavericks are deep and gelling. ""The chemistry is good in the locker room and on the floor,"" Porzingis said. ""We got out and do what we're supposed to and play hard. No secret. We have a great bench and that's our strength, just so many weapons."" Joel Embiid had 33 points and 17 rebounds for Philadelphia, which lost its third in a row overall. The 76ers were booed for much of the night while falling to 14-2 at home. The 76ers suffered their first home loss on Wednesday, 108-104 to Miami in a contest in which the Heat stifled Philadelphia with a 2/3 zone. ""The past three games we have laid eggs,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We have not played with a competitive drive that reflects this team."" Philadelphia couldn't solve Dallas' matchup 2/3 zone, either. Dallas held the 76ers to 29.4% shooting from long range; Philadelphia missed 24 of 34 3-pointers. Dallas took control in the second quarter, going up by as many as 17 points. The Mavericks held an 88-77 lead entering the fourth. Trey Burke, normally not in Brown's rotation, came off the bench and pulled Philadelphia within seven points, 94-87, with seven minutes remaining. But the Mavericks kept coming offensively, with a Hardaway 3 initiating an 11-6 spurt that ended with a jumper by Jalen Brunson that put Dallas ahead 108-93 with 3:22 left, leading to more boos and chants for the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles will host the Dallas Cowboys in an important NFC East divisional game across the street on Sunday. Porzingis put an exclamation point on the victory with a driving, one-handed jam with 39.3 seconds left. ZONING OUT Carlisle said the Mavericks went to the zone four minutes into the contest and stayed with what was working. ""We got hot with the zone and we were active in it,"" he said. ""Guys scrambled around and played their butts off. The most important thing is to play hard in it, and that's what we did."" Embiid said the 76ers need to attack the zone with more aggressiveness and take the shots when they are there. ""We were playing scared,"" he said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Brunson, who starred collegiately at nearby Villanova, was booed during introductions. He finished with 11 points and seven assists in 24 minutes. . Dallas also won at Milwaukee on Monday without Doncic, ending the Bucks' 18-game winning streak with a 120-116 victory. 76ers: Longtime Philadelphia news anchor Jim Gardner rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell in the pregame. . Tobias Harris had seven points and Al Horford had nine. ... Ben Simmons had 12 points, eight assists and five turnovers.","401161067"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder proved earlier in the week they can rally for dramatic wins. On Friday night, they showed they can control a game throughout. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 32 points, and the Thunder rolled past the Phoenix Suns 126-108. The Thunder had come back from 26 points down against Chicago to win on Monday and from 24 points down against Memphis to claim a victory Wednesday. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan prefers what he got against the Suns. ""These guys are working hard and they know the last two games against Chicago and Memphis -- that's not sustainable,"" Donovan said. Gilgeous-Alexander helped put the Thunder in a better position by making 13 of his 18 field-goal attempts. ""The shots just went in today, honestly,"" he said. ""I get those shots a lot of nights, and they went in tonight. But that's just a testament to the work I put in every day, and I trust it, and it worked out for me."" Gilgeous-Alexander, a second-year guard, leads the Thunder in scoring. ""It's just a good experience for me,"" he said. ""Not a lot of young guys get to play as much as I do. And the times I do it, I'm blessed and fortunate to be in the position. I'm trying to take full advantage of it."" Dennis Schroder scored 24 points and Danilo Gallinari scored 22 for the Thunder, who shot 56.3% from the field. Oklahoma City has won three straight and eight of 11 to even its record at 14-14. Ricky Rubio scored 24 points for the Suns. Devin Booker returned to Phoenix's starting lineup after missing three games with a right forearm contusion. He finished with 18 points, seven below his average. He made 6 of 11 shots. ""I feel good,"" Booker said. ""I'm excited to be back out there. Obviously not the outcome that I want."" It was Phoenix's fourth straight loss. ""We're in a tough stretch right now,"" Booker said. ""It's my job, it's our job as leaders on this team to dig ourselves out of this hole."" Oklahoma City led 57-50 at halftime behind 15 points from Gilgeous-Alexander. Gallinari hit a 3-pointer, was fouled and made the free throw to put the Thunder ahead 77-69 in the third quarter. Oklahoma City led 101-91 at the end of the period. Oklahoma City closed the game out by outscoring the Suns 25-17 in the fourth quarter. ""That's what we talked about going into this game is that we've really got to try to put a whole game together,"" Donovan said. ""And inside the whole game, you're going to have lapses and moments where you're not playing maybe, pretty basketball. But I felt like the way we were trying to play to an identity standpoint on both ends -- the guys were executing pretty well."" TIP-INS Suns: Coach Monty Williams is a former Thunder assistant. ... Phoenix's starters shot 14 for 23 in the first half while its reserves shot 3 for 12. ... C Aron Baynes was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter. Thunder: C Steven Adams was issued a technical foul in the second quarter for throwing a ball that hit Baynes. ... Oklahoma City shot 50% in the first half. ... Gallinari was called for a technical in the third quarter for voicing disapproval after Baynes wasn't called for a foul following contact. SECOND HALF DOMINANCE In victories over Chicago, Memphis and Phoenix, the Thunder have averaged 65.3 points in the second half while allowing 50. SIXTH MAN Schroder has come in hot off the bench during the win streak. He's averaged 24.3 points in the three games and has made 26 of 50 shots from the field. HE SAID IT Gallinari, joking about Gilgeous-Alexander's big game: ""It's nice to see him play like that. I always tell him that when he plays like this, he just looks like a young Gallo (Gallinari). So he did a great job.""","401161068"
"DENVER --  Jamal Murray has found his scoring touch just in time for the Denver Nuggets to face the best team in the Western Conference. It helps to have one of the best passers in the NBA getting him the ball. Murray scored 28 points, including nine in the final minutes of the third quarter to stem a rally by Minnesota, and Denver completed a sweep of a five-game homestand with a 109-100 win over the Timberwolves on Friday night. Nikola Jokic had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his fifth triple-double of the season and 33rd of his career. He has eight straight double-doubles, including two triple-doubles in that span. Murray struggled to score recently, but has put up 61 points in the last two games, hitting shots that impress his teammates. ""Sometimes he has a wide-open shot and he takes a stupid shot and he makes it,"" Jokic said with a laugh. ""He's a talented player; he can make every shot, especially inside the 3-point line."" The Nuggets' five-game winning streak has come against teams with losing records, but now they will face the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, a team that beat them by nine in Denver on Dec. 3. ""When we played them, we weren't making shots,"" Murray said. ""Now, we are, so hopefully it carries over."" Minnesota, playing without center Karl-Anthony Towns for the second straight game due to a sprained left knee, has lost nine straight. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 19 points and Gorgui Dieng had 18. ""We played hard and competed. That has been common throughout the streak,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""There just haven't been the results."" Dieng was the only Minnesota player to have a positive night behind the arc. He was 4 for 6 from 3-point range while the rest of the team was 6 of 36 from long range. ""We have to have faith to continue to shoot the ball,"" Dieng said. The Nuggets flipped the script from Wednesday when they trailed Orlando by 19 in the third quarter and went on a 32-2 run to take a lead they never relinquished. Denver never trailed Friday, using a fast start to force the Timberwolves to play catch-up. The Nuggets hit 13 of their first 15 shots before missing five straight to end the first quarter. Minnesota got within four points in the second and trailed by just two late in the third, but was never able to take the lead. The Timberwolves had a couple of chances to go up when it was 72-70, but missed two 3-pointers and Murray scored seven points in 1:37 to help the Nuggets pull away. ""I'm looking for my shot more and when I'm open not hesitating,"" Murray said. Denver led by as many as 19 points late in the fourth before Minnesota pulled within single digits. TIP-INS Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell was recalled from Iowa of the G League. It is his third call-up of the season. ... G Jarrett Culver missed Wednesday's game with flu-like symptoms. He had two points and three rebounds in 12 minutes. Nuggets: The 13 home wins are second-most in the Western Conference behind the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Denver has two winning streaks of five or more games this season. ... The Nuggets are 5-0 against Northwest Division opponents. Last year, they finished 12-4 within the division. MOVING ON UP Jokic tied Bob Cousy for 10th all-time in career-triple doubles. He is fifth among active players and at age 24 is the youngest player in the top 10. ""It's nice to be in that company,"" Jokic said. Jokic is nine behind Houston's James Harden and 10 behind eighth-place Fat Lever, who holds Denver's franchise record.","401161069"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard powered the Portland Trail Blazers to another big win. Even a little injury scare for Carmelo Anthony turned out all right. Lillard scored 36 points, CJ McCollum had 31 and the Trail Blazers beat the Orlando Magic 118-103 on Friday night. Portland earned its season-high third straight victory despite losing Anthony to a bruised left knee in the second quarter. The Trail Blazers improved to 8-7 since Anthony joined the team a month ago. ""Everything is good,"" Anthony said. ""It was just a knee-to-knee contusion. I've done it before. I didn't want to take a chance going out there, we were rolling and we set the tone early. I was fortunate enough to look at the score and we were up 20 at one point in time. It happens."" Anthony said he intends to play Saturday night against Minnesota. Hassan Whiteside added 10 points and 17 rebounds for Portland in his 13th straight double-double. ""It feels good for the game to feel like we're supposed to win,"" Lillard said. ""When it gets down the stretch, whether it's a tough game or whatever is happening, it feels like we're going to pull this out. Not like, alright, how is this going to go? It feels like we're rolling. It's not like crazy things are happening for us to win."" Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Portland's backcourt took over in the third quarter. Lillard had 16 points and three assists in the period, helping the Blazers build a 93-75 lead. McCollum scored 10 points in the quarter. D.J. Augustin scored 17 points for Orlando, and Evan Fournier had 16. Aaron Gordon grabbed 11 rebounds in the Magic's sixth loss in seven games. Orlando was hurt by a slow start. Portland put together a 14-0 run and led 31-13 after the first quarter. ""We just tried to pack the paint, force them into tough shots, funnel them into Whiteside and secure the rebound,"" McCollum said. The long scoring drought prompted Vucevic to throw a towel down in frustration after being subbed out. ""Our defense wasn't at the level it needed to be against a team like that with the kind of players they have,"" Vucevic said. ""With two great players like Lillard and (McCollum) we just have to so a better job at that end."" Gordon struggled again, going 4 for 17 from the field while scoring 11 points. He is shooting 40.6% from the field, by far the lowest mark of his six-year career. ""We all go through it at some point. He'll bounce back out of it,"" Vucevic said. ""We all know how good Aaron is and what he brings to the table for us. He keeps competing and keeps playing hard so he's gonna make shots."" The Magic got back into the game with a 14-2 run to start the second quarter. They trailed 57-44 at halftime. Orlando played without Michael Carter-Williams in the second half after he departed with a left shoulder injury. The Magic closed out a 1/3 road trip. TIP-INS Magic: One of the biggest surprises of the NBA season has been the play of Markelle Fultz, who was selected by Philadelphia with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft. Fultz struggled at the start of his career with the 76ers, but he has worked his into the starting lineup for the Magic. ""He has an ability to set a tone on both ends of the floor on every possession,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""And I think that's what the best point guards do. He's in the paint, which was one of our big weaknesses last year. When he's on the floor we're much more inside out and we score off of his penetration."" Fultz had 10 points and four assists in the loss. He also had a rousing dunk in the fourth quarter on Portland's Anthony Tolliver. Trail Blazers: Former Blazers forward Al-Farouq Aminu, who is rehabbing his way back from a torn meniscus, got a loud ovation when he was shown on the big screen during the fourth quarter. Aminu signed with Orlando in free agency. ""He was probably our best post defender,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""He guarded perimeter guys, he guarded centers. He was an exceptional player in his role for us in that, especially defensively but also offensively he developed into a very important 3-point shooter for us.""","401161070"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Slowly but surely Steve Kerr is seeing growth in Golden State. Having DAngelo Russell around to take big shots at key times certainly helps. Russell made a tiebreaking 22-foot jumper with 32.9 seconds remaining, and the struggling Warriors won after blowing a 20-point lead, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 106-102 on Friday night in a matchup of the worst teams in the West. ""That's who he is. Hes built in that way, to close a game, because hes not afraid to miss,"" Kerr said. ""You cant worry about missing. D-Los never worried about that. With Steph (Curry) and Klay (Thompson) out, hes a guy we have to rely on."" Russell finished with 25 points and seven assists as the Warriors (6-24) snapped a five-game losing streak with their second win over the Pelicans (7-23) this season. Damion Lee had 20 points and six rebounds for Golden State. Draymond Green added 10 points and eight assists. Jrue Holiday and Brandon Ingram scored 25 points apiece for New Orleans. Lonzo Ball had 14 points. The Warriors jumped on the Pelicans early on, but New Orleans rallied to take an 81-78 lead on Holidays 39-foot buzzer-beater to end the third. Holiday stayed hot in the fourth quarter and made a 20-foot jumper that put the Pelicans ahead 97-91. Golden State trailed 98-93 before ripping off seven straight points. After Ingram made a pair of free throws, Russell made the go-ahead jumper just inside the arc. Thats our growth, Russell said. I always say young teams find a way to lose at the end of games. Older teams dont do that. Theyre solid the course of the game. Thats where our growth was today. We made that free throw, we made that extra rebound, we got that stop. New Orleans lost two nights after beating Minnesota on the road to end a 13-game losing streak. We didnt establish anything until the second quarter so already we (were) behind the eight ball, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. From the second quarter on we did a good job but obviously D-Lo made some pretty big shots. Thats what hes supposed to do. We have to find a way to win that game. TIP-INS Pelicans: J.J. Redick made four 3-pointers in the third quarter. He finished with 14 points. Warriors: Lee had 10 points in the first quarter. ... Green picked up his sixth technical foul of the season in the third. ... Injured star Curry made a rare appearance and sat on the bench. The two-time MVP drew a rousing ovation when he was shown on the giant video screen.  Eric Paschall left in the second quarter with a right knee injury and was being evaluated after the game. WILLIAMSON ON SLOW ROAD BACK Zion Williamson continues to make steady progress in his rehabilitation from right knee surgery, although New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry is not yet ready to set a timetable for the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. I dont know if theres a one, two, three, four (steps) towards when he gets back out there, Gentry said. We are going to be overly cautious, I know that. Hes making normal progress in a situation like this. Its just not going to be anything that we are going to rush.","401161071"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  With his team trailing by eight points at halftime, Jazz coach Quin Snyder showed his players some clips from the first half when they were missing players in the corners for wide open 3s. Utah fixed those mistakes in the second half and rallied for another victory. Bojan Bogdanovic finished with 26 points, Rudy Gobert had 17 points and 19 rebounds and the Jazz shot 10 of 19 from 3-point range in the second half to beat the Charlotte Hornets 114-107 on Saturday for their fifth straight victory. Donovan Mitchell added 20 points for the Jazz (18-11), and Joe Ingles had 14 points, including two pivotal 3s in the fourth quarter. ""It was about keeping it simple and making the simple read,"" Mitchell said. ""And we ended up doing that in the second half."" Snyder wasn't around to see his strategy fully come to fruition after being ejected midway through the fourth quarter after arguing for a call. ""We have an unselfish team we just have to be aware of what the defense is doing and where the rotations are and how to find people,"" Snyder said. ""I think when we have that awareness we are a team that's willing to move the ball, and that's what happened, the ball the started moving and our guys got open looks."" Bogdanovic finished 7 of 12 from the field and made all eight free throws. ""I have never seen a guy that everyone on the bench, every time he gets it, yelled at him to shoot, and he usually does at the right times particularly,"" Snyder said. ""When the game gets close, he is at his best."" Terry Rozier, who was coming off a career-high 35 points in a 100-98 loss to Cleveland on Wednesday night, had 29 points for the Hornets (13-19). Devonte Graham added 22 points. ""Obviously it's tough to be a team that lives and dies by the 3 when they're hitting,"" Rozier said of the Jazz. ""So you try to stay locked in for 40 minutes, but sometimes you can't do anything about it. All the credit goes to them for knocking down shots."" Added Hornets coach James Borrego: ""They've got multiple ball handlers with size that can pass over our defense. Give them credit, they kicked it, they made shots."" The Hornets played one of their better first halves of basketball, shooting 58% from the field to build a 64-56 lead behind 25 total points from Graham and Rozier. But the Jazz battled back to take the lead for good with 9:15 remaining when Ingles knocked down a 3 after a turnover by the Hornets. Bogdanovic knocked down a 3 to help push the lead to eight points, and Gobert had a dunk with 16 seconds left to help seal the win. TIP INS Jazz: Gobert and the Hornets Nic Batum were teammates on the French national team, most recently competing in the 2019 FIBA World Cup. ... Guard Mike Conley sat out again with a hamstring injury. ... Bogdanovic was so mad at himself after being called for travelling in the third quarter he purposely bounced the ball off his own head in the direction of the official. ... Utah was 19 of 20 from the foul line. Hornets: Batum got a rare start for the Hornets and Cody Martin saw playing time off the bench as Borrego looked to mix things up, as he's been known to do when he feels he needs a spark. SNYDER EJECTED Snyder got ejected for arguing with an official on a play in which two of his players collided while going for a loose ball. Snyder got in the face of Ray Acosta and was immediately tossed. But the Jazz didn't let it bother them and outscored the Hornets 15-11 in the final 6:44 with Snyder in the locker room. ""I thought there was a foul, but those guys have a tough job,"" Snyder said. ""But our staff kept them together and I thought our guys responded as well."" BEST FRIENDS Mitchell said his high school teammate Graham should be the NBA's Most Improved Player. Graham is averaging 19.1 points and 7.5 assists this season for Charlotte after moving into a starting role earlier in the season. ""That's a Devonte that I have known for my whole life,"" Mitchell said. ""He's a kid that steps up and wants the clutch moment and wants everything. And he's going to go get out there and get it. I think he really deserves the Most Improved Player. To do what he's doing, it's really unmatched.""","401161072"
"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie carried the Brooklyn Nets to their largest comeback victory of the season. Before the game, Dinwiddie spoke with NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who he grew up idolizing. According to Dinwiddie, Bryant told him he's ""playing like an All-Star."" Dinwiddie played like one on Saturday night, scoring 39 points as the Nets overcame a 47-point performance by Trae Young and beat the Atlanta Hawks 122-112. Garrett Temple added 25 points, and DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and a season-high 20 rebounds for Brooklyn. Temple praised Jordan for being Brooklyn's most consistent bench player, so far. ""You know what you're going to get out of D, a veteran guy that can really protect the rim, put pressure on the basket on the offensive end and get every rebound that comes off the rim,"" Temple said. ""We need his veteran presence."" Alex Len had 23 points and 14 rebounds for Atlanta, which lost its seventh straight game. ""Frustrating,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""I thought our guys gave all that they had to put us in a position to win the game. The offense really let us down tonight -- 39 points in the second half. We go 2 for 24 from 3 in the second half. I think you saw some glimpses of a young team lose their will, lose their confidence in a game where we had the will, we had the pace and control of the game."" With Atlanta trailing 113-110, Kevin Huerter lost the ball and Joe Harris drove for a layup and converted a free throw. Dinwiddie iced the game with a layup to give Brooklyn a 118-110 lead with 1:13 remaining. Atlanta took an 18-point lead, its largest lead of the game, as Young hit a floater in the lane with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter, but couldn't protect it. The Nets went on a 14-0 run to begin the fourth quarter and took a 99-98 lead as the Hawks missed their first nine shots. ""We had, I think, a 13-point lead headed into the fourth quarter,"" Young said. ""We just let one get away from us. They went on a run, and we couldn't stop it. So yeah, we definitely felt like we let one get away."" The Hawks took a 73-60 lead into the locker room at halftime as Young led all scorers with 24 points. Young's pick-and-roll partner, Len, had a double-double in the half with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Dinwiddie scored 20, a career-high for first-half points, to keep Brooklyn within striking distance. ""There wasn't much said at halftime,"" Temple said. ""We knew we weren't playing with any energy in the first half. They were outrebounding us, doing everything better than us.""

"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons swept the season series with Chicago in 2018-19. Now the Bulls are a win away from returning the favor. Chicago can only hope that becomes relevant in a few months, if both teams are competing for a playoff spot. Zach LaVine scored 33 points and Coby White added 19 to help the Bulls outlast the short-handed Pistons 119-107 on Saturday night. Chicago is 3-0 against Detroit this season. The Bulls (12-19) and Pistons (11-19) are 10th and 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, but Chicago trails eighth-place Orlando by only one game. ""We see it, and that's our goal -- get into the eighth place,"" Chicago's Kris Dunn said. ""We've got to go in Monday against Orlando and do what we do."" The Pistons were without Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, and the Bulls pulled away late thanks to LaVine's outside shooting. He and White made five 3-pointers apiece. Detroit has lost four straight. ""I thought we competed in the first half, but we ran out of gas in the second half,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We were trying to get guys in and out and give them a blow, but it is a 48-minute game."" The Pistons led 59-53 at halftime but allowed 40 points in the third quarter. Chicago led 93-83 late in the period, but Markieff Morris made two 3-pointers in the last 10 seconds to cut the margin to four. LaVine broke a 96-all tie in the fourth with a 3-pointer. Then with the Bulls up by four, Detroit challenged a foul call on Tony Snell with 4:21 left. The call was overturned, but Chicago controlled the ensuing jump ball, and LaVine made another 3 to make it 106-99. Andre Drummond had 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Pistons. Griffin has been dealing with an illness, and Rose missed the game with left knee soreness. Chicago was 18 of 35 from 3-point range. TURNOVERS AND REBOUNDS The Pistons had 25 turnovers in a 114-93 loss at Boston on Friday night. Then they had to face a Chicago team that entered the game forcing a league-high 18.6 turnovers per game. Detroit had only 16 turnovers to Chicago's 21 on Saturday, but the Bulls made up for that by outrebounding the Pistons 46-29. ""We won the boards, which I think you have to do in this building to have a chance to win,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""I didn't like the turnovers, but when you make 18 3s you have a little margin for error."" QUOTEABLE Dunn on LaVine's offensive efficiency: ""It's almost like setting up the table. You just can't make food and then think you're just going to eat it out of the pot. You've got to put the plates down, you've got to put the forks down, you've got to put the glasses down. That's what he's doing. He's not scoring, scoring, scoring, scoring. That's easy to guard. You're getting your team involved, you still stay aggressive, and when the fourth quarter comes, be you."" TIP-INS Bulls: Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 rebounds, surpassing 600 in his 75th career game. He's the fifth player in team history to reach 600 rebounds in his first 75 games, joining Tom Boerwinkle, Elton Brand, Charles Oakley and Clifford Ray.

"PHILADELPHIA --  The Philadelphia 76ers finally figured out how to beat a zone defense. Joel Embiid had 21 points and 13 rebounds and Josh Richardson added 21 points to lead Philadelphia to a 125-108 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Ben Simmons had 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the 76ers, who snapped a three-game losing streak overall and a two-game skid at home. Philadelphia suffered its first two home losses in its last two times out, Wednesday against Miami and Friday versus Dallas. Both teams used zone defenses that neutralized Philadelphia's offense. But the Wizards, playing without several key players, weren't as effective when they tried to use the zone. Simmons said it was because the 76ers kept the ball in motion. ""I think we did a lot better moving the ball,"" Simmons said. ""That's really the key, we can't hold on too long. I've been playing against it my whole life. It's not new. Everyone has to be on the same page as far as moving the ball."" Brown said before the game that he thought Simmons, the team's star point guard, could be most effective against the zone as a ""committed offensive rebounder."" Simmons had four offensive boards, and Brown was pleased overall with his players' approach to the previously troubling defense. ""I give them a lot of credit for executing plays that would expose zone rotations,"" Brown said. Bradley Beal had 36 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Wizards. Washington has lost three in a row and nine of 11. ""This is a championship team,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said of the 76ers. ""We're not close to that right now. We want to get there."" Both teams were playing the second game of a back-to-back, and Philadelphia had all players available. ""I wish they could have had some load management games,"" Brooks joked. Isaiah Thomas added 20 points, but was ejected with 2:53 remaining for going into the stands. Philadelphia took control with a 19-0 run over a nearly six-minute stretch in the second quarter, pushing a 34-30 advantage to 53-30 with 4:19 left in the half. Beal's corner 3 with 1:40 left in the third got Washington as close as four, 84-80, but the 76ers scored the last four points of the quarter to take an 88-80 lead into the fourth. The 76ers kept Washington at a distance throughout the fourth to improve to 15-2 at home. THOMAS' TAKE Thomas said he confronted a spectator who thrice repeated two expletives while flashing the Wizards guard two middle fingers. According to Thomas, the fan apologized when confronted and said he was upset Thomas made a free throw because a miss would've given fans a milkshake from a local establishment as part of a team promotion. ISH MISS Ish Smith, coming off a perfect performance in Washington's 122-118 loss at Toronto on Friday, went scoreless in 20 minutes. He was 0 for 7 from the field, including 0 for 2 from beyond the arc, and missed both of his free-throw attempts.

"Jay Williams compares Giannis Antetokounmpo to Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant and believes Giannis has separated from the rest of the NBA. (1:22) NEW YORK --  Giannis Antetokounmpo had a triple-double, though his brother had the highlight. And while the NBA MVP wasn't interested in talking about his stats, he certainly was impressed by Thanasis' one basket, a follow slam with his left hand in the fourth quarter. ""That was amazing. That was a crazy dunk. He came out of nowhere,"" Giannis said. And the Greek Freak had a good seat on the bench to celebrate it after another easy win for the NBA's top team. Antetokounmpo had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his third triple-double of the season, and the Milwaukee Bucks followed their big victory over the Lakers by routing the New York Knicks 123-102 on Saturday night. Avoiding any letdown two nights after winning a showdown against Los Angeles for the NBA's best record, the Bucks (26-4) made their first six 3-pointers to open a big early lead that grew to 29 points. ""Luckily we've got a group that is very professional, very motivated,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think they take their work seriously, they take their routine, the process seriously, and I think it reflected coming off a big win and coming out and playing the way we did in the first quarter."" Antetokounmpo had secured his triple-double by midway through the third quarter after playing just 23 minutes. It appeared for a while that he was going to be finished for the night at that point, but he was eventually called on for some fourth-quarter minutes. He took only 10 shots, making eight. ""I don't look into stats,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""All I care about is that we came in here, we got the job done. Got another one tomorrow."" Khris Middleton scored 23 points and Kyle Korver had 17 for the Bucks, who are playing without starters Wesley Matthews and Eric Bledsoe because of right leg injuries. They didn't miss them at all. It wasn't quite as easy as Milwaukee's 132-88 home victory in one of David Fizdale's final games as Knicks coach, but it was plenty good enough to increase the average victory margin for a team that came in leading the league at 12.8 points per game -- a figure that would be the highest in NBA history if it stood until the end of the season. Julius Randle had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Knicks, who lost for the second straight night. They were out it early after missing nine of their first 10 shots, though they did keep fighting hard enough to force the Bucks to bring Antetokounmpo and other starters back off the bench midway through the fourth after Milwaukee led by 25 through three quarters. ""They went 6 for 6 from the 3-point line to start the game, which was our game plan, to make their guys take shots,"" Randle said. ""They did to start the game and then they cooled off. We didn't make shots to start the game, which just hurt us."" Milwaukee put seven players in double figures in its second straight win after Dallas snapped its 18-game winning streak earlier this week. The Bucks bounced back from that by beating the Lakers 111-104. The Bucks led by 47 points in the first matchup against the Knicks and started this game poised to deliver another blowout. Donte DiVincenzo scored the first five points, consecutive 3-pointers by Brook Lopez made it 17-4, and Ersan Ilyasova's second 3-pointer made it 23-6 and forced the Knicks to call their second timeout in less than 4 1/2 minutes. TIP-INS Bucks: With Matthews sitting for the first time this season, the Bucks used their seventh different starting lineup. ... Milwaukee beat New York for the fourth straight time. Knicks: Elfrid Payton replaced Frank Ntilikina as the starting point guard and had six points, 10 assists, five rebounds and four steals. ... Kevin Knox II had 19 points off the bench. LIFE IS GOOD Budenholzer was a candidate for the Knicks coaching job following his successful run in Atlanta. The Knicks hired Fizdale instead, and Budenholzer doesn't wonder about what might have been. ""No, I don't really think that way,"" the 2018-19 Coach of the Year said. ""Life works out the way it's supposed to and just beyond happy with being in Milwaukee. Ton of respect for the Knicks and their organization here, but at the end of the day just very, very happy with Milwaukee and the team, the organization, the city. Just, I'm in a great place and I feel very, very fortunate.""","401161076"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  This time, the Memphis Grizzlies made their fourth quarter lead hold. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 18 points, Jae Crowder added 17 points and 10 rebounds, and the Grizzlies beat the Sacramento Kings 119-115 Saturday night. Memphis lost road games to Oklahoma City and Cleveland earlier this week, squandering fourth quarter leads in both defeats. The Grizzlies were able to hold on despite the Kings slimming the advantage to 118-115 in the closing seconds. Seven Grizzlies reached double figures, including 16 from Dillon Brooks. Grayson Allen and Ja Morant had 13 each as Memphis snapped a two-game losing streak. ""Hopefully we're learning, trying to find out how to close games. That's a big part of the NBA being able to close games,"" Crowder said. ""We withstood some runs and responded. The other two nights, other teams went on runs, and we sort of didn't answer the bell."" Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 25 points. De'Aaron Fox, easing back after missing 17 games with a left ankle sprain, scored 22, and Richaun Holmes had 18 points and 12 rebounds. Sacramento dominated the paint 60-40 against a Memphis team that is among the league leaders in that category. Sacramento's 18 offensive rebounds contributed to a 31-5 advantage in second-chance points. ""We should've won that game,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""I was proud of the guys continuing to fight being down in the fourth quarter."" Barnes' 13 points in the third quarter helped Sacramento put a dent in a Memphis lead that reached 16 in the first half. The Grizzlies built the lead back to double-digits and led by at least eight until the final 49 seconds when Fox scored five straight points. Barnes hit three free throws and Trevor Ariza's 3-pointer with five seconds left pulled the Kings to 118-115. ""Everybody is upset when you lose,"" said Kings guard Buddy Hield, who continued to struggle with his shooting. ""I don't know who is not upset. If you're not upset, you shouldn't be playing on this team."" TIP-INS Kings: G Bogdan Bogdanovic missed his second straight game because of right ankle soreness. ... Fox was back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the past two games following the ankle injury. ... Marvin Bagley III had 11 points and 11 rebounds. ... Hield, who was 3 of 15 from the floor and 1 of 9 from 3-point range in Friday's loss at Indiana, was 3 of 18 overall and 2 of 11 from outside the arc against Memphis. It was only Hield's fourth game this season not reaching double figures, half of those coming the last two games. Grizzlies: C Jonas Valanciunas was out with right foot soreness. Solomon Hill started his second game of the season in Valanciunas' absence. ... Had 15 3-pointers, marking a franchise-best nine straight games where Memphis has made at least 10 3-pointers. ...

NO WORRIES ON BUDDY Hield is 9 of 33 on 3-pointers over the past four games. Despite the misfires, Kings coach Luke Walton said before the game he's not worried about the guard's recent shooting woes. ""Buddy's a great shooter. He's a hard worker,"" Walton said. ""People are going to make and miss shots in this league. ... We're not concerned with Buddy. He'll get it going more nights than not.""","401161077"
"SAN ANTONIO -- The LA Clippers dunked on the San Antonio Spurs more times than any team in 20 years en route to Kawhi Leonard's first victory in San Antonio since his exodus from the franchise. Leonard finished with 26 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and five of the Clippers' 20 dunks as LA dusted the Spurs 134-109 on Saturday night. ""He was as sharp as I've seen him,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""Not only with his scoring, but with his defense and his passing."" The Clippers' 20 total dunks are the most since play-by-play data started tracking the stat before the 1996-97 season. The second highest was 17 dunks by the Lakers in April 1998, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research. Leonard was roundly booed during pregame introductions and each time he touched the ball, just as he was in two previous visits to San Antonio. The reigning Finals MVP gave the sellout crowd plenty to jeer about during an active 27 minutes. Leonard was 11-for-16 from the field with four steals and only two turnovers in setting a hurried pace the Spurs were unable to match. The Clippers had 74 points in the paint, 26 fast-break points and 36 points off 18 turnovers. ""It's embarrassing,"" said Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, who had 24 points. ""It's frustrating, especially when you're out there trying hard, definitely frustrating."" Leonard benefited from the increased pace, slamming in his season-high five dunks. ""I was able to get out in transition, especially get down the paint and able to dunk the ball,"" Leonard said. Leonard demanded a trade after playing just nine games for the Spurs in 2018 due to a right thigh injury. San Antonio relented and traded him the next summer to Toronto, where he led the Raptors to their first NBA championship last season. Spurs fans have remained bitter about his forced departure, making the team's blowout victories over Leonard and the Raptors last season and the Clippers on Nov. 29 that much sweeter. ""Just the way I probably left and how it was portrayed, the narrative that was portrayed in the media,"" Leonard said. ""But, I don't make no sense of it. I know it's a game and it's competitive. When we're not playing or if I'm walking on the street or I see someone from San Antonio, they thank me for everything I did and they respect the way I played when I was here. It's just a part of the game, I feel like."" Leonard turned the tables in his fifth matchup with San Antonio, spending the entire fourth quarter on the bench as Los Angeles stretched its lead to 33. The Clippers went on a 12-2 run for a 52-44 lead with 7 minutes left in the first half as Leonard and Paul George remained on the bench. Leonard returned shortly thereafter, making all three of his attempts in the second quarter to push the Clippers to a 64-52 lead. The Clippers outscored the Spurs 41-21 bridging the second and third quarters. Los Angeles had six players in double figures, including 21 by Montrezl Harrell and 20 by Lou Williams. George finished with 11 points. DeRozan, who had 13 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the first quarter, finished with 24 points to lead San Antonio. Marco Belinelli added 17 points. TIP-INS Clippers: Former Spurs F JaMychal Green missed the game with a bruised tailbone. ... Landry Shamet had three points in 14 minutes in his third game off the bench after 13 starts. Spurs: F Rudy Gay had seven points in 20 minutes after being listed as questionable due to an undisclosed illness. ... C Jakob Poeltl had four blocked shots, raising his season total to 41 in 28 games. ... San Antonio is 73-15 against the Clippers at home. BACK TO BACK Leonard has not played in back-to-back games this season, and Rivers said that won't change when the Clippers visit Oklahoma City on Sunday night despite his limited minutes against the Spurs. ""I haven't even thought about it, but we'll see. I doubt it,"" Rivers said. ""Just too early for me, to be honest. He may bring it up, but I still don't think we'll do it.""","401161078"
"PHOENIX --  The James Harden-Russell Westbrook combo is starting to become everything the Houston Rockets hoped it would be. The two superstar guards bring different speeds to the offense, and the Phoenix Suns couldn't stop either one Saturday. ""Russell is go, go, go, go,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""When it's half-court, maybe it's James' time."" Harden scored 47 points, Westbrook added 30 and the Rockets rolled to a 139-125 victory over the Suns for their 10th victory in the past 13 games. Phoenix pulled to 115-107 with 9:37 left but the Rockets responded with a 21-9 run -- which included four 3-pointers from Harden -- that slowly deflated the Suns' players and crowd. Harden shot 15 of 27 from the field, including 9 of 19 from 3-point range. He leads the NBA with 38.5 points per game and blew past that number with his fourth quarter outburst, hitting his quartet of 3s in a span of about three minutes. The former Arizona State star has already scored 1,124 points this season, most for a player through 29 games since Rick Barry had 1,134 in the 1966-67 season. By the end of the night, he received an ovation from a big chunk of the fans. ""This city has shown me so much love before I even got to the NBA,"" Harden said. ""So I feel like it's my job to go out there and put on a show."" Harden's scoring has been a constant throughout the season, but Westbrook's production has spiked in recent weeks. He's averaging 33.7 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists over his past three games. The two players took turns dominating on Saturday, hitting Phoenix with waves of offense that couldn't be stopped. ""I don't know if 30 (points) is a benchmark or not, but Russell's playing really well, doing a lot of stuff,"" D'Antoni said. ""And you know James has been playing great."" Said Westbrook: ""It's a good balance for our team, for myself. I think it's moving in the right direction."" Westbrook added 10 assists, and Clint Capela had 14 points and 17 rebounds. The Rockets shot 59% from the field. The Suns have lost six straight games and fell to 11-18. Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 26 points, and Devin Booker had 19. Elie Okobo scored 17 in his first start of the season and all five starters scored in double digits for just the third time this season. Booker said he thought the Suns did a good job of competing in the second night of a back-to-back after losing to the Thunder on Friday, but they couldn't figure out a way to stop Harden or Westbrook. ""They're MVP players, they're going to make those shots,"" Booker said. ""It's how you respond and just keep defending and playing the right way."" Harden scored 18 points in the first quarter and had 29 by halftime, shooting 10 of 15 from the field, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range. The Rockets led 70-65 at the break after shooting 61% from the field. TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon (knee) has missed the past 19 games after having knee surgery. He had the surgery on Nov. 13 and was expected to miss about six weeks. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said he wasn't sure if Gordon would return during the team's four-game trip that ends on Christmas Day against Golden State. Suns: C Deandre Ayton missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle. Ayton played in just one game after returning from his 25-game suspension, scoring 18 points against the Clippers in 24 minutes before leaving in the second half after injuring his ankle. ... PG Ricky Rubio missed the game because of an illness. Okobo started in his place. ""You can boo-hoo and whine about it, but it does no good,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said pregame. ""You look around the league, Minnesota is missing players, New Orleans is missing players all year. ... It's happening to everyone. I don't know if anyone's dealt with what we've dealt with, but I like my team, I like the fight and the way they show up every day.""","401161079"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Hassan Whitesides play, good or bad, is critical to the Portland Trail Blazers. The 7-foot center was at his best Saturday night, finishing with 16 points, 22 rebounds and seven blocks as the Trail Blazers beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-106 for their season-high fourth straight victory. Even while he was struggling with injuries earlier this season and became the subject of trade speculation, Whitesides teammates never stopped motivating him to dominate. When you see games like this game, the Golden State game, stuff like that, its almost like its obvious when hes not doing it, said Damian Lillard, who scored 29 points for Portland. Its obvious when hes not bringing it because when he does, its so obvious and its such a big deal for our team. It was a great game. Great game. Whiteside leads the NBA with 73 blocked shots. That was a challenge from my coach -- lead the league in blocks, Whiteside said. I feel like Im the best rim protector in the league, he added. Even last year, through all the naysayers or whatever, you look who protected the rim in field goal percentage, it was still me at the end of the day. So I feel like Im the best rim protector (and) its not even close. Over the last four games, Whiteside has averaged 13 points, 19 rebounds and four blocks. We really need him to rebound defensively or were not going to get the rebound, as weve shown, Portland guard CJ McCollum said. McCollum had 26 points and swingman Kent Bazemore scored a season-high 19 for the Blazers, who played without a banged-up Carmelo Anthony. Andrew Wiggins scored 33 points for the Timberwolves, but Whiteside made things difficult for them inside all night. Its hard to finish over him, Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. Minus injured All-Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns, the Minnesota offense continued to struggle early, particularly from outside as the Wolves missed nine of their first 10 3-point attempts. Gorgui Dieng helped by making three 3-pointers and scoring 15 points. Shabazz Napier had 18 points and four assists, while Jeff Teague scored 18 off the bench. Lillard had 19 points in the first half to push Portland to a 61-52 halftime lead. Minnesota went on a 7-0 run to start the second half, fueled by Portland turnovers. After committing only five turnovers in the first half, the Blazers had five to begin the third quarter. Teagues running 3 cut the Blazers lead to 83-80 at the third-quarter buzzer. Another 3-pointer by Teague tied the game 83-all at the 11:02 mark of the fourth quarter. He scored 12 straight points for Minnesota before being subbed out. Minnesota tied it two more times in the fourth before Portland pulled away. A basket from Lillard and a 3-pointer from McCollum pushed Portland ahead 98-93 with 5:24 left. The Blazers kept the Wolves at arms length for the rest of the game as Minnesota never again got closer than three. Whitesides putback gave Portland a 107-100 lead with 41 seconds left to put the game away. TIP-INS Timberwolves: For the third straight game the Timberwolves were without Towns, their leading scorer. His injury has forced Saunders to tinker with his lineups, such as moving Teague to a sixth-man role off the bench to help power the reserves to 44 points on Friday. It makes a big difference, Saunders said. Obviously, were missing a big piece in Karl and we just ask for daily growth. We just ask these guys to compete. We felt good coming out of the game last night. Saunders said Towns was progressing but didnt offer much more. Trail Blazers: After banging knees against Orlando on Friday, Anthony was ruled out for this one. He left Fridays game in the second quarter and did not return. After working out a little bit Saturday morning, Anthony made the determination not to play. He got treatment this morning just to see how things felt and it just wasnt quite right, coach Terry Stotts said. Anthony is averaging 16 points and six rebounds per game while shooting 41.7% on 3-pointers.","401161080"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors used a huge fourth quarter to pull off the NBAs biggest comeback in a decade. Lowry had 32 points and 10 assists, Chris Boucher scored a career-high 21 points and the Raptors overturned a 30-point deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 110-107 on Sunday. Lowry had one fewer point in the fourth (20) than the Mavericks managed as a team (21). Ive never seen anything like it, coach Nick Nurse said of Lowrys explosive finish. It was the biggest comeback in Raptors history, and the NBAs first 30-point comeback since Sacramento beat Chicago on Dec. 21, 2009, according to Elias. Players from both sides found the outcome tough to comprehend. Im definitely going to go watch the game again, just to see how exciting this game was and how the fans helped us so much, Boucher said. Dallas forward Kristaps Porzingis wasnt interested in a second viewing after making five of 15 shots. Tonight was a weird game, honestly, Porzingis said. I still cant process what happened. Even Lowry wasnt sure he wanted another look at the first three quarters. I probably wont enjoy it till later on, fourth quarter, Lowry joked. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 18 points and Fred VanVleet had 10 as the short-handed Raptors won their fifth straight and improved to 13-3 at home, ending the Mavericks seven-game road winning streak. Porzingis had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Jalen Brunson scored 21 points as Dallas dropped to 2-2 without guard Luka Doncic, who sat for the fourth straight game because of a sprained right ankle. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said his team didnt maintain its aggression after the Raptors started fighting back. When you get hit with that kind of force, youve got to respond with equal or greater force, and we just didnt do it soon enough, Carlisle said. Toronto trailed 83-53 with 2:55 remaining in the third, but used a swarming defense and hot shooting from Lowry to tie the score at 95 with 5 1/2 minutes to go in the fourth. They were just taking it to us, Dallas guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said. Before you knew it, they cut the lead to 10 and then cut the lead to five. Hollis-Jefferson made a pair of free throws with 4:31 remaining to put the Raptors up 98-97, their first lead of the second half. Lowry hit a 3 on Torontos next possession, making it a four-point game. A three-point play by Brunson with 1:14 left cut it to 106-105 and Porzingis made a pair from the line with 32 seconds remaining, putting Dallas up one. Lowry fed Boucher for a go-ahead dunk and, after a Dallas timeout, Brunson missed a jumper that would have given the Mavs the lead. Boucher was fouled as he grabbed the rebound and made both free throws, putting Toronto up by three with 1.6 seconds left. Porzingis launched a game-tying shot from his own side of half before the buzzer but it fell short. The Raptors made four of 23 attempts from 3-point range through the first three quarters, then made six of 11 shots from distance in the fourth, four of them from Lowry. Dallas missed 11 straight field goal attempts to begin the game, and didnt score until Porzingis hit the second of two free throws with 6:43 left in the opening quarter. Dorian Finney-Smith made a 3 with 6:19 left in the first to halt the shooting slump. The Mavericks had more turnovers (seven) than made baskets (five) in the first, but Toronto couldnt take advantage and led 20-17 after one. Dallas used a 16-2 run in the second to lead 51-42 at halftime. The Mavericks led 86-63 through three quarters before matching the biggest blown lead in franchise history. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas G Delon Wright played in Toronto as a visitor for the first time. The Raptors drafted Wright 20th overall in 2015. He played in 172 games with Toronto before being traded to Memphis last season, part of the trade that sent Marc Gasol north of the border. The Raptors honored Wright with a tribute video at the end of the first quarter.  Brunson led Dallas with nine assists.  Six of Dallas 12 made baskets in the second were 3-pointers. Raptors: Lowry had eight rebounds.  C Dewan Hernandez (right ankle) was inactive. CALL IT A COMEBACK Torontos previous biggest comeback was from 25 down at Detroit on Dec. 11, 2010. Jerryd Bayless matched his career high with 31 points as the Raptors beat the Pistons 120-116. FANTASTIC FOURTH The Raptors set a franchise record for points in the fourth quarter with 47. It was Torontos biggest single quarter of the season. LATEST ON LUKA Doncic worked out and ran sprints on the court before the game, and is expected to take part in Mondays practice. Asked when Doncic will play again, Carlisle said the four games between Christmas and January are certainly in play.","401161081"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics found a game plan that worked in crunch time against the Charlotte Hornets. They got the ball to Jayson Tatum and got out of the way. Tatum scored 22 of his career-high 39 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 12 rebounds as Boston pulled away and beat Charlotte 119-93 on Sunday night. ""I was really happy with our team for finding him,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""As he got hot, they were locked into him."" Tatum eclipsed his previous high of 34 points against Brooklyn on Jan. 14. The promising 21-year-old forward didn't have a 30-point game before that but has now had four. ""I just try to stay aggressive no matter what,"" Tatum said. ""I feel like we've done a good job this year with (finding) different guys. Just trying to continue to make the right play but find the guy that's hot."" Kemba Walker added 23 points against his former team. Jaylen Brown had 16 points and nine rebounds, and rookie Grant Williams added 12 points off the bench for the Celtics. Boston has won three straight and seven of nine. Devonte' Graham had 23 points and 10 assists, Bismack Biyombo scored 18 and Miles Bridges 15 to lead the Hornets. Charlotte has dropped three straight and four of five. Terry Rozier scored 14 for the Hornets in his return to Boston. He left the team in free agency last summer. Rozier finished with three points on 1-of-11 shooting in a 108-87 home loss to Boston on Nov. 7. Rozier didn't get a video tribute as some ex-Celtics do in their return, but a small picture of him with the caption ""welcome back"" was hung outside the Hornets' locker room. ""Yeah, I think I need a bigger sign,"" Rozier said with a laugh. Walker had 14 points on 4-of-12 shooting in his return to Charlotte in November. Walker left the Hornets in July after eight seasons, joining the Celtics on a four-year, $141 million deal in free agency. Boston opened the game's first double-digit lead at 72-62 on a 3-pointer from the right corner by Semi Ojeleye with 7:24 left in the third quarter. Charlotte pulled within 75-73 after Biyombo's floater with 4:30 left capped an 11-3 run. Malik Monk's three-point play 13 seconds into the fourth cut the Celtics' lead to 84-80, but Tatum scored 17 of the Celtics' next 19 points to blow the game open. ""You know he's going to score at some point,"" Charlotte's Marvin Williams said of Tatum. ""You just hope he doesn't get 40 like he did tonight. He's good enough to get 40. It's just one of those nights for him."" Tatum's step-back 3-pointer with 4:30 remaining gave him a career high. Tatum's late surge reminded Rozier of what it felt like to go on a run in front of the Boston crowd. ""There's nothing better than these fans. They make you feel like you can touch the sky. He did just that,"" Rozier said. ""He's a superstar in the making and just killed us tonight."" Boston led by as many as 26 points in the closing minutes. Graham scored 17 points as Charlotte led 37-30 after one quarter, but the second-year guard was held to two in the second and Boston took a 59-56 lead into halftime. KEMBA-LIKE Graham was hot in the first quarter, going 5 for 6 from beyond the arc. Graham tied a franchise record for 3-pointers in a quarter, a record shared by ex-Hornet Walker. Graham's 17 first-quarter points also matched Walker for the most by a Hornets player in the last two seasons. NOT SO SCARY Rozier, nicknamed ""Scary Terry"" during his tenure in Boston, is a combined 7 for 28 in two games against his former team. TACKO TIME II For the second straight game, the crowd erupted when Celtics' 7-foot-5 reserve Tacko Fall stood up to check in with three and a half minutes remaining. The crowd again chanted ""MVP!"" and cheered wildly for every play Fall was involved in. Fall finished with four points, two rebounds, and a block. TIP-INS Hornets: Rookie F P.J. Washington was sidelined for a fifth straight game after fracturing his right pinkie finger on Dec. 13 at Chicago. Washington, the No. 12 overall pick in this year's draft, is averaging 12.3 points through 28 games.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo makes a fan's day by giving her his shoes and shirt, plus taking a picture on the court after the Bucks' win. (0:29) MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks gave Malcolm Brogdon a warm welcome. Then they went about their usual business. Antetokounmpo had 18 points, 19 rebounds and nine assists, and the Bucks spoiled Brogdon's return to Milwaukee with a 117-89 win over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night. ""Happy for him,"" Antetokounmpo said of Brogdon. ""We had a chance to talk a little bit before the game. Just keep getting better, man. He's going to help his team."" Wesley Matthews scored 19 points for NBA-leading Milwaukee, which has won three in a row since a 120-116 loss to Dallas stopped an 18-game win streak. Brogdon was drafted by Milwaukee and spent his first three seasons with the Bucks before he was acquired by Indiana in a sign-and-trade deal over the summer. He was welcomed back with cheers and a tribute video, and finished with 10 points on 5-of-19 shooting and 10 assists. ""It was great to be back in Fiserv (Forum),"" Brogdon said. ""These fans have been amazing to me. They were amazing to me tonight. They've been amazing to be the past three years. Just incredibly thankful for them."" The 6-foot-5 Brogdon was voted NBA Rookie of the Year in 2017. He became the eighth member of the league's 50-40-90 club last season (shooting at least 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 90% from the free-throw line). ""I would have loved (to continue) to play for this team if they had wanted me, if they had valued me the way the Pacers valued me,"" Brogdon said before the game. Brogdon scored his first points on a layup with 10:28 to play in the second quarter, giving the Pacers a 26-24 lead. Donte DiVincenzo made a layup to give Milwaukee a 56-55 advantage with 53 seconds left in the first half, and the Bucks never trailed again. Milwaukee outscored Indiana 58-34 in the second half and had a 48-34 advantage in points in the paint. ""They do a really good job of collapsing on you in the paint so it's hard to get some of those floaters and mid-range shots up,"" Pacers forward Doug McDermott said. ""So it was a little bit of an adjustment. You gotta hits 3s if you want to beat these guys and we didn't hit enough."" Domantas Sabonis had 19 points and 18 rebounds for Indiana, and McDermott finished with 15 points. The Pacers shot 12 for 40 from 3-point range. The Bucks made 15 3-pointers, including five straight in the fourth. ""I felt we were able to make plays,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Once you see one going in and somebody making a play for the guy next to him, it makes the game a lot easier and gives everybody momentum."" Brook Lopez and George Hill each had 17 points for the Bucks. Hill is averaging 16 points off the bench over the last three games. ""I think in the first half, without him, we probably would have been in a hole,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said of Hill. ""He carried us in the half. He's been doing it every night."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana has lost four straight against the Bucks dating to last season. The Pacers are 0-2 against Milwaukee this season, losing 102-83 at home on Nov. 16. Bucks: Milwaukee played its fifth game (4-1) without guard Eric Bledsoe, who fractured his right leg against the Memphis Grizzles on Dec. 13. Bledsoe is expected to miss about two weeks.","401161083"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George's return to Oklahoma City was spoiled by a player the Thunder got back when they traded him. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander matched his career high with 32 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder rallied to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 118-112 on Sunday night. George, who finished third in the MVP voting last season, was sent to the Clippers for Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari in a deal that began the restructuring of the Thunder roster. George was cheered when he was introduced during the starting lineups. ""It was great,"" he said. ""It made me feel appreciated, just being here. I enjoyed my time here."" George scored 18 points, but he made just 6 of 17 shots and had five turnovers. Gilgeous-Alexander made 12 of 25 field goals. Oklahoma City trailed by 18 points in the second quarter, making it the third time in seven days the Thunder overcame a deficit that big to win. This time, the victory came against the No. 2 team in the Western Conference standings. ""That's a really good team over there,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""Obviously, they've been in all type of different situations. It's good. It's really good, especially they way we were down in the first half."" Los Angeles scoring leader Kawhi Leonard sat out because of left knee soreness. Dennis Schroder scored 16 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and Steven Adams added 20 points and 17 rebounds to help the Thunder win their fourth straight. Oklahoma City has won nine of 12 to move above .500 for the first time this season. ""You just go on chemistry, being more comfortable with the offense, defense, you could do all that sort of stuff,"" Adams said. ""Figuring out playing habits -- you could go on, mate."" Lou Williams scored 22 points for Los Angeles, and Montrezl Harrell had 18. The Clippers led 63-57 at the half, with Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 19 points for the Thunder. Gilgeous-Alexander's layup tied it at 66 in the third quarter. After the Clippers seemed to regain control, the Thunder remained competitive. Paul's 3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer cut it to 89-86. With 5:35 to play, Harrell appeared to score and draw a foul from Nerlens Noel. The basket would have given the Clippers a 100-94 lead with a free throw coming. The Thunder challenged the call and it was changed to a charge on Harrell. The Clippers weren't sure if the challenge worked as it was supposed to. Some time passed as Harrell waited to shoot the free throw. ""I just thought the delay was strange,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We kept asking, 'What was the delay for? What was the delay for?' The ref kept holding the ball."" The Thunder took advantage. Schroder's 3-pointer put the Thunder ahead, then Adams had a steal and a layup to make it 110-106 with 1:19 to play. After the Thunder got a stop, Schroder's layup put the Thunder up by six. ""I think as mad as we are that we're letting games get away early, we're starting to figure out how to win them now,"" Paul said. ""We've got to keep it going. Even if we're not making shots, knowing we can get stops. Really good teams in this league -- that's when they buckle down -- the fourth quarter."" TIP-INS Clippers: Patrick Patterson, who played for the Thunder last season, started and also was cheered during pregame introductions. ... G Patrick Beverley sat out with a sore right groin.

"LOS ANGELES --  Buoyed by a perfect five-game homestand, the Denver Nuggets hit the road and kept on winning. Paul Millsap scored 21 points and the Nuggets dominated the second half in defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without LeBron James, 128-104 on Sunday night for their sixth win in a row. ""Our last homestand gave us confidence to come on the road and win,"" Millsap said. ""We have so many weapons."" The Nuggets had six players in double figures. Gary Harris added 19 points, Nikola Jokic had 18 points, Malik Beasley had 16 points and Will Barton III had 14 points and a career-high-tying 13 rebounds for the Nuggets, who pulled away to a 23-point lead early in the fourth. ""It feels good to get a win in L.A. even if LeBron wasn't playing,"" Jokic said. James missed his first game of the season because of a thoracic muscle strain. That left the Lakers without his 25.8 point average and 10.6 assists. ""It's kind of hard to next-man-up LeBron,"" said Kyle Kuzma, the only other Laker in double figures with 16 points. ""He does so much. Shots come easier when he's on the floor because everyone just looks at him."" With James looking on in street clothes, Anthony Davis did his best to make up for it with 32 points and 11 rebounds. He scored 11 points playing all 12 minutes of the first quarter. ""It's tough when he's out but we still got to find ways to win,"" Davis said. ""We lost our energy defensively. We got to continue to defend and once we get that edge back we'll be fine."" Davis slipped and tweaked his right leg in the third quarter, but felt good enough to play 7 1/2 minutes in the fourth. ""Hopefully nothing significant happens,"" he said. The Lakers can't afford to have Davis go down at the same time as James with a Christmas game against the Clippers looming. The Western Conference-leading Lakers have lost three in a row since winning seven straight. Kuzma returned after missing five games with a sprained left ankle. ""This is probably the healthiest I've been all season,"" he said. ""Just got to get my legs back a little bit."" Millsap was questionable to play because of a left knee contusion, but he consistently scored with Davis and Kuzma in the lineup late in the second quarter. His 3-pointer put the Nuggets up 55-53 at the break. Denver scored 73 points in the second half while holding the Lakers to 51 points. ""It was the best game we've had from start to finish this season,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Our starters played well and our second unit played outstanding. When we do that we are hard to beat."" The Lakers successfully challenged a goaltending call against Davis midway through the third that took a basket away from the Nuggets. But Denver responded with a 23-11 run to take a 91-78 lead into the fourth. Seven players scored during the spurt, led by Millsap with seven. ""We came out more aggressive in the second half and got rebounds and knocked down our shots and played excellent defense,"" Millsap said. The Nuggets opened the fourth with a 17-7 run with Harris and Beasley doing all the scoring that gave them a 108-85 lead. Beasley had nine points, making two 3-pointers, and Harris had eight. ""We played a great team basketball game,"" Jokic said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Improved to 4-0 in the first game of a back-to-back. ... Their three-game road skid ended. Lakers: They fell to 10-3 at home. ... Rajon Rondo made his first start of the season and had five points and eight assists. ... There was a pregame moment of silence for JoAnn Buss, the former wife of late Lakers owner Jerry Buss and mother of their four children, who now own the franchise.

"CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Cavaliers' backcourt of the future pushed them to victory Monday night. Rookies Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr. took over in the fourth quarter and the Cavaliers held off a late Atlanta comeback for a 121-118 victory. Collin Sexton, a second-year player, scored 25 points while Garland had 21 and Porter added 15. Garland had 10 points and Porter added nine in the final period. The two will take on a bigger role after the Cavaliers agreed to trade veteran guard Jordan Clarkson to Utah for guard Dante Exum before the game. Porter and Garland are both 19 years old, and dealing with a teammate being traded was a new experience. ""I've never been in this situation,"" Porter said. ""It was kind of devastating. For the first three quarters I kept thinking about it. It's not a good feeling, but you've got to keep going."" The Cavaliers will also receive two future second-round draft picks in the trade, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press. Cleveland will get a pick in 2022 and one in 2023, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the teams have not yet had the required conference call with the NBA to approve the swap. The deal came together shortly before the Jazz played in Miami and the Cavs' game began. Clarkson warmed up on the floor at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse before he was informed of the trade. Cleveland has won three straight for the first time since taking five in a row from March 28 to April 5, 2018 in LeBron James' final season with the team. ""It shows that we are improving,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""I don't know if we win this game a month ago."" Trae Young scored 30 points, but his 3-pointer that would have tied the game in the closing seconds hit off the front of the rim and sent Atlanta to its eighth straight defeat. ""We've got to take way more pride on the defensive end,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""That's what competition is. It's personal pride. I don't know how you make guys mentally tough. That's where it is right now."" Cleveland built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter before the Hawks rallied. Young scored eight points in the quarter and Atlanta had a chance to tie with 5.1 seconds to go after a Cavaliers' miss. The Hawks set up for a final shot, but Young's attempt from about 30 feet fell short. Atlanta forward John Collins returned from a 25-game suspension for violating of the NBA's drug policy. He was in the starting lineup and scored 27 points with 10 rebounds. Kevin Love had 20 points for the Cavaliers. Cleveland led 71-64 at halftime, scoring a season high in points for a half. TIP-INS Hawks: C Bruno Fernando took Love's elbow in the mouth in the third quarter and went to the locker room with a towel to his face. He did not return. ... Backup Alex Len sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and didn't return. Cavaliers: Beilein hopes rookie guard Dylan Windler, who has been out all season with a stress reaction in his left leg, will play in January. Windler missed training camp with the injury and played for Canton of the G League before being shut down a couple of weeks ago. COLLINS RETURNS Collins was suspended Nov. 5. He averaged 17 points and 8.8 rebounds in the first five games of the season. Atlanta went 4-21 without Collins, who is in his third season. ""It knocks the rust off, going against a guy like Kevin Love,"" he said. ""I felt good, OK."" SHORT-HANDED In addition to Clarkson's departure, Larry Nance Jr. missed the game for Cleveland because of a sore left knee. The 6-foot-7 forward averages 8.6 points and 7.2 rebounds. ""He's sort of a Swiss Army knife out there,"" Beilein said of Nance's versatility. ""He does a lot of things.""","401161086"
"DETROIT --  Two years ago, the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Clippers made a blockbuster trade, with Blake Griffin coming to the Motor City in exchange for Tobias Harris. Monday, it appeared the long-term winner of the trade has been the Philadelphia 76ers. Harris outscored Griffin 35-8 and Ben Simmons added a triple-double as the 76ers beat the Pistons 125-109, ""We were able to get our offense rolling, score, get stops and get out in transition"", said Harris, who was traded to Philadelphia in February. ""We did a good job of just attacking."" Joel Embiid had 20 points and eight rebounds for the 76ers, who improved to 11-4 in their last 15 games. Simmons finished with 16 points, a career-high 17 assists and 13 rebounds. ""I was just sharing the ball, moving with pace and trying to tighten any gaps,"" he said. Reserve Furkan Korkmaz added a career-high 21. ""Furkan gave us some good contributions,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""We had 33 assists and 12 turnovers, which is an incredible ratio -- Ben had 17 of those assists -- and I especially liked our offensive rebounding."" Andre Drummond had 27 for the Pistons, who have lost five in a row. Griffin, who had missed the previous two games with knee soreness, scored eight points on 2-for-14 shooting. ""I've got no excuse,"" said Griffin, who has also been dealing with flu-like symptoms. ""I've just got to be better. I'm used to contributing more and I just haven't been able to do that."" The Pistons rebounded a season-low 59% of Philadelphia's missed shots. Detroit's three lowest defensive-rebound percentages of the season, all under 70%, have come in the last three games. ""We've been looking at it, believe me,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""Some of it is just boxing out, but a lot of it is guys coming in from the corners. It's a little bit of everything. Guys are shooting in and we don't have vision of them, and when Andre helps on someone, we have to crack down on his man."" Korkmaz had 10 points in the third period to help the Sixers build a 10-point lead, but Derrick Rose's layup made it 94-86 going into the fourth. Philadelphia forced three turnovers in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter and expanded their lead to 103-92. After that, its dominant rebounding kept the Pistons from getting back into the game. Drummond sat out the first 8:42 of the game after missing shootaround Monday morning. It was the first time he had come off the bench since his rookie season. ""That's a team rule,"" Casey said. ""We might be getting our butts kicked on the floor, but we're going to have discipline."" The Sixers led by as many as 12 in the first half, but Svi Mykhailiuk and Markieff Morris combined for 19 points to keep Detroit within 60-52. Late in the half, Harris threw a misplaced lob to Simmons, who was able to reach back and make a reverse layup. On the next possession, the pair flipped roles, with Harris guiding a Simmons alley-oop into the basket. ""He had a small defender, and I know he can make spectacular plays, so I just threw the ball in the air,"" Harris said. ""He made a crazy layup and the next time he threw me one like I have athleticism like he does. I managed to get it in, so that was cool."" Tim Frazier scored seven points in the first four minutes of the third, helping the Pistons tie the game at 65, but the 48-30 rebounding deficit was too much for Detroit to overcome. ""I think a lot of the problem is coming from transition defense,"" Griffin said. ""We're not getting matched up, so we're all trying to pick up someone we aren't used to guarding from a position we're not used to playing."" TIP INS 76ers: The Sixers have beaten the Pistons five straight times and are 5-0 at Little Caesars Arena. Pistons: Griffin, Christian Wood and Rose all played despite knee issues, but Bruce Brown (calf) and Luke Kennard (knee) missed the game. STRUGGLES AT HOME The Pistons have lost five straight at home, matching their longest streak since moving to Little Caesars Arena in 2017. LINGERING BAD FEELINGS Griffin and Harris had to be separated with 5:21 to play. Both players were issued technicals, just as Simmons and Wood had been after a third-quarter disagreement. BEST IN 51 YEARS Simmons became the first 76er to have at least 16 points, 17 assists and 13 rebounds since Wilt Chamberlain did it twice in 1968.","401161087"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Aaron Holiday likened the back-and-forth test of resiliency against the defending NBA champions to that of a playoff game. Each time the Indiana Pacers or Toronto Raptors sank a dramatic shot, the intensity level increased that much more, the escalating emotion eventually spilling into overtime. That's when Holiday hit his two most important attempts, both 3-pointers, to help the host Pacers snap the Raptors' five-game win streak with a 120-115 overtime triumph on Monday. ""It's a big win for us,"" said Holiday, who finished with 19 points in getting the start at point guard for the injured Malcolm Brogdon. ""It's fun playing with emotion, especially in big games."" His fourth 3-pointer of the game gave the Pacers a 116-113 lead with 2:05 remaining in overtime. His fifth and final 3-pointer provided a 119-115 advantage with 54 seconds remaining. ""It just shows the toughness, 48-plus minutes, we're going to be relentless on both ends,"" said T.Y. Warren, who along with Myles Turner led the Pacers with 24 points apiece. ""I'm glad the way we responded, tough shots and we got some key stops at the end."" The Pacers (21-10) set a franchise record with 42 3-pointers attempted and matched a season high with 18 made. That included four in the fourth quarter and overtime. The Raptors (21-9) missed 17 of their first 19 shots from 3-point range in falling behind by 15 points in the second quarter. They eventually rallied, despite finishing 11 of 40 from beyond the arc. Both teams missed potential game-winning shots in the final minute of regulation as Holiday's layup was too long off the glass before Kyle Lowry's last-second 3-pointer bounced off the front of the rim. Lowry tried his best to be the hero for a second consecutive night in leading all scorers with 30 points. He scored 32 points in a record comeback win from 30 points down at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. ""We gutted it out, we played our butts off and gave ourselves a chance to win at the end,"" Lowry said of the Raptors, who were missing two starters due to injuries. ""Unfortunately, we came up short."" Lowry managed just two points in overtime, when the Pacers outscored the Raptors 13-8. ""We got ourselves a five-point lead, probably should have put it away there but give them credit,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of the Pacers' fourth-quarter deficit. ""A bunch of 3's late, a bunch in the fourth quarter, a bunch in overtime."" Serge Ibaka added 23 and Fred VanVleet 21 for the Raptors The Pacers' Myles Turner sank 5 of 6 3-pointers in finishing 9 of 12 from the floor. ""Resilience, that's what we showed tonight,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""That's one of the better teams in the conference. We knew they were going to be a team that scrapped, and our guys came and they fought. They kept their composure throughout the game, despite losing the lead, and stayed with it.""

"NEW YORK --  Washington coach Scott Brooks understands how difficult it has been for Gary Payton II to find a spot in the league since going undrafted three years ago. The 27-year-old guard could hang around for a while if he continues to play the way he did Monday night. Payton finished with 10 points, 11 rebounds and five assists off the bench to help the short-handed Wizards outlast the New York Knicks 121-115. With almost half their roster out due to injuries, the Wizards had to reach out to the G League to grab an extra body even before they learned that Isaiah Thomas was going to be hit with a two-game suspension for entering the stands to confront a fan during Saturday night's game in Philadelphia. Payton took a red-eye flight from Las Vegas that night and landed in Washington on Sunday. A physical exam came back fine and Payton was off to New York on an Amtrak train. ""Hopefully, he sticks and plays a long time in this league. He has what every coach wants. Defensive toughness. A presence,"" Brooks said. ""Makes winning basketball plays. It's remarkable. He flies in and meets with me for two minutes. He meets with our staff and has a breakfast meeting and plays so well. Give him credit."" Bradley Beal scored 30 points and Troy Brown Jr. added 26 off the bench for the Wizards, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Ish Smith added 17 and Anzej Pasecniks, who's on a two-way contract, chipped in 14 for a Washington team that only had nine healthy players ready at tip-off. Payton was one of them and certainly didn't disappoint. ""They told me they were short-handed and I was going to go. I was prepared to go,"" Payton said. ""They told me about the basic schemes and what not. We went over a few plays on offense."" The son of Hall of Famer Gary Payton, who was nicknamed `The Glove' because of his defensive presence, Payton wasn't too shabby on that end of the court as he finished with six steals over a career-high 34 minutes. He picked up whatever he could during a pregame meeting with the coaching staff that lasted no more than 10 minutes. ""He just took advantage of his opportunities given and he's a true talent,"" Beal said. Julius Randle had 35 points and reserve Damyean Dotson added 19 for New York, which lost its third straight. Randle was critical of New York's lack of focus, which he traced all the way back to the team's morning shootaround at its practice facility despite jumping on Washington early to start the game. ""I think our approach the whole day was terrible,"" Randle said. ""From shootaround on, I think we had a bad approach as a team collectively, top to bottom, myself included. We could have been better. We jumped out on them, got the lead and didn't sustain it. Washington trailed by 13 points late in the first quarter before heading into halftime down 64-63. The Wizards then went on a 14-0 run to open up the second half and seemed on their way to an easy win after increasing the lead to 116-99 with 4:40 remaining before New York stormed back. New York then went on a 16-2 run, highlighted by Mitchell Robinson's hustle in the paint for a dunk that cut the lead to 118-113 with 1:20 left. On the next possession, Robinson swatted Beal's layup, leading to Randle's layup on the other end that made it 118-115 with 48 seconds to play. Brown then missed a 3-pointer, but Elfrid Payton missed a potential tying 3 from the top of the arc. Brown then hit three straight free throws to seal it for Washington. TIP-INS Wizards: F Jason Robinson made his first NBA start. He was recalled from Capital City Go-Go, Washington's G-League affiliate. . Beal attempted a career-high 38 shots. He made 13. Knicks: F Marcus Morris (sore left Achilles tendon) did not play. . Veteran forward Taj Gibson (illness) was also held out. . Payton had 12 assists. RIGHT AND WRONG Brooks understood where the league was coming from when it issued its suspension of Thomas, but also called for improved control over fans attending games. ""I understand the rule. The rule is there and it's a good rule,"" Brooks said. ""But I think we also have to be cognizant that we have to control some of the fans. What they say, it's just out of control at certain places."" FILLING IN Payton was averaging 21.4 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists for the South Bay Lakers and was the G League player of the week for the week ending Dec. 16.

"MIAMI --  Derrick Jones Jr. knows there is some debate over whether he dunked on two-time reigning defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert, and his stance on the matter could not be clearer. ""It was a dunk,"" Jones insisted. Gobert may have thought otherwise. Doesn't matter. The numbers on the scoreboard were absolute. Jimmy Butler scored 20 points, Bam Adebayo scored 18 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and the Miami Heat survived a huge night from Gobert to beat the Utah Jazz 107-104 on Monday night -- improving the NBA's best home record to 13-1. ""We found a way just to grit it out and a different way to win,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Against a team like that, that's a heck of a win."" The Heat were down by seven late in the third, then went on a 21-4 run to take a 10-point lead early in the fourth -- and stayed ahead the rest of the way. Tyler Herro scored nine of his 17 points in the fourth for Miami. ""I'll take the blame for that. It's on me,"" said Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell, who shot 5 for 18 and finished with 13 points. ""He kicked my (butt) on three straight possessions."" Goran Dragic scored 15 for Miami, which outrebounded the Jazz 55-46 and ended Utah's season-best five-game winning streak.

But Butler hit a pair of free throws for Miami moments later, sealing the outcome. ""I thought we got tired,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We had some really good looks. And then not getting stops doesn't give you an opportunity to score off your defense."" Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 for Utah. Gobert had a huge night -- 18 points on 9 for 11 shooting, a season-high 20 rebounds and five blocks. ""He's super-smart,"" Spoelstra said. Heat fans were standing at the end. They had another highlight worth remembering in the second quarter -- when one of the game's best dunkers took on the two-time defensive player of the year. Jones went into the lane, took off about five feet from the basket and scored over Gobert. It was officially recorded as a dunk, and Jones said he made contact with the rim on his follow-through. Jones headed to the other end, hands on either side of his head in disbelief of what he had done. Twitter lit up with the consensus being that Gobert had been posterized, and the Heat guard agreed. ""That's for sure,"" Jones said. Shortly before the game, the Jazz agreed to trade little-used reserve guard Dante Exum and a pair of future second-round picks to Cleveland for Jordan Clarkson. Exum averaged 2.2 points in 11 appearances this season; he was on the active roster for the game, but his locker was cleaned out not long afterward. TIP-INS Jazz: Ingles played in his 334th consecutive game, extending the NBA's longest active streak. ... Mitchell had seven assists, but the Jazz managed only 17 on 39 field goals. Heat: Miami announced a sellout for the 433rd consecutive time, including playoffs, which ties for the sixth-longest streak in NBA history. ... Duncan Robinson's team-record streak of 14 straight games with multiple 3-pointers ended. He had one. WAITERS RETURNING Monday's game marked the end of Dion Waiters' latest suspension, his third of the season -- of the one-, 10- and now six-game varieties. Waiters has not played this season and it's unclear when or if the Heat will put him back on the floor. But he will be permitted to attend practices again later this week, and games again starting Friday. EARLY TROUBLE Bogdanovic hadn't committed more than one first-quarter foul in any game this season -- then got whistled for three in a span of six minutes of the opening quarter on Monday. The only other Jazz player with three first-quarter fouls in a game this season was Jeff Green, who did it against Minnesota on Nov. 20. It was Bogdanovic's first three-foul opening quarter of his career.","401161091"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The San Antonio Spurs scored early, often and at a season-best shooting pace both overall and from 3-point range. The combination, along with 40 points from LaMarcus Aldridge and 26 points, plus 10 assists from DeMar DeRozan, contributed to a 145-115 rout of the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. San Antonio shot 67.4% overall, 62.5% from 3-point range and recorded its season-high point total. DeRozan would miss only one of his 11 shots; Aldridge was 17 of 25 from the field. The 67.4% from the field was the best shooting percentage in an NBA game this season. The 36 assists also were a season high. ""It was just one of those nights,"" said Aldridge, who also had nine rebounds and five assists. ""We've had nights where we've been on the other end of it, where we couldn't throw it in the lake."" As the positive records fell the way of San Antonio, the misery landed on the Grizzlies. The 145 points were the most ever given up by the franchise, and the 46 first-quarter points by the Spurs were the most ever scored against the Grizzlies in a quarter. ""They played unbelievable tonight,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""They had a response for everything we were throwing out there coverage-wise, schematic-wise. .They had a heck of a shooting night, especially from the midrange, the rim, the 3s, all that."" Trey Lyles finished with 17 points and Dejounte Murray scored 14 for the Spurs. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 22 points for Memphis, converting 8 of 14 shots and 6 of 9 from 3-point range. Rookie Ja Morant finished with 19 points, and Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and 12 rebounds as Memphis lost for the third time in the last four. The Spurs were uncanny in their shooting accuracy from the start, connecting at 79% in the first quarter -- and that included missing their final two shots in the period. While San Antonio couldn't keep that pace, it dropped only slightly. The Spurs were 31 of 42 in the second half (73.8%) and made 7 of 12 3-pointers. ""It is just about letting that build our confidence,"" DeRozan said. ""Go out there and be consistent. Go out that and play like this -- especially on the defensive end -- every single night."" With the Spurs shooting, Memphis never really had a chance at overtaking San Antonio once the first-quarter lead reached 19. There were a few times the Grizzlies got the deficit under double-digits in the second half but never less than eight. The San Antonio lead eventually swelled to the final 30-point margin. ""They have a lot of shooters,"" Morant said. ""All shot it great. It's hard when they are hitting a lot of shots. . It's rare for a team to shoot how they shot."" TIP-INS Spurs: Hit 19 of their first 22 shots. The streak of made baskets went so long that once Aldridge missed a shot late in the first quarter, it drew a loud cheer from the Memphis faithful. . Aldridge reached at least 30 points for the fourth time this season. . Marco Belinelli had 10 points. Grizzlies: Valanciunas returned to the starting lineup after missing Saturday's game against Sacramento with right foot soreness. He recorded his 16th double-double. .The 145 points given up by Memphis were the most this season. The previous high was 138 by Dallas on Nov. 9. NOT THE WORST NIGHT The 30-point loss was not the worst of the season for Memphis. The Grizzlies lost by 32 at Orlando, 118-86, on Nov. 8. ""Defense is the thing we hit all the time,"" Jenkins said. ""Not trying to downplay this, but it's been 30 games and this is the first time (in a while) that we've gotten our rear end handed to us."" LAST WORD The Spurs were in a similar situation to the Grizzlies on Saturday when they lost at home to the Clippers 134-109. And, even a coach of few words, like San Antonio's Gregg Popovich, recognized the swing in fortunes. ""(LaMarcus) and DeMar led the way. It was great to see the whole team jump in. We had a bad game last game. This is the way you react to something like that.""","401161092"
"PHOENIX --  Jamal Murray shot fearlessly in the final seconds, with only one thought on his mind: winning. Denver's been doing a lot of that lately. I was just in a zone, not thinking about anything really, Murray said. Just in a zone. Everybody was locked in. Murray made a tiebreaking jumper with 3.2 seconds left, Nikola Jokic finished with a triple-double and the Nuggets rallied for a 113-111 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Monday night. Murray finished with 28 points on 12-of-19 shooting from the field, including 4 of 8 shooting on 3-pointers. Jokic had 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his seventh triple-double of this season. The Nuggets extended their winning streak to seven games while the Suns have lost seven in row. The teams traded clutch shots in the final moments. First it was Murray who hit a 3-pointer with 27 seconds left to push Denver ahead 111-108. Two seconds later, Devin Booker nailed a 3-pointer off an inbounds play to tie it. Murray had one more big shot in him, making a jumper just inside the 3-point line with 3.2 seconds left to give the Nuggets a 113-111 lead. Booker had a 3-point attempt blocked by Jerami Grant just before the final buzzer. Down the stretch, (Murray) was phenomenal, Denver coach Michael Malone said. This wasn't our best game, but when you don't play your best on the road, you have to find ways and that is what I'm proud about. The Suns trailed for most of the night, falling behind by 16 points in the second quarter, but slowly fought their way back. The Nuggets hit 12 of their first 17 3-point attempts but finally cooled off midway through the third quarter and missed their next seven from long range. That allowed Phoenix to make a push and Frank Kaminsky's short jumper early in the fourth quarter gave the Suns an 83-82 lead, their first since the first quarter. Rookie Cameron Johnson hit two 3-pointers in a row -- one on a bank shot -- to put the Suns ahead 91-88 with about 9 minutes left in the game. Phoenix pushed that advantage to 101-92 but Denver rallied to tie it at 108 with 2 minutes left on Jokic's 3-pointer. The Suns haven't won a game in two weeks and this one hurt more than most. That was a tough one, Johnson said. I felt like we had a lot of momentum going into that fourth quarter, halfway through and that's a tough one. I really though we were going to pull that one out. Ricky Rubio scored 21 points for the Suns. Eight Phoenix players scored in double figures, but it wasn't enough to snap its lengthy losing streak. It's the deep hurt that allows you to grow, Suns coach Monty Williams said. It's a life principle, and certainly in sports. We have to start closing these games out. I thought some of our possessions, we just missed shots or made passes that just weren't there. Five minutes to go in the game, that's a playoff game and everything has to be executed well. Denver jumped out to a 34-22 by the end of the first quarter after shooting 67 percent from the field but the Suns were able to cut the deficit to 56-49 by halftime. Murray had 10 points in the first half. Rubio had 16 before the break on 7-of-10 shooting from the field. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was playing its third game in four days. ... The Nuggets hit 10 of 15 3-pointers in the first half. ... The Nuggets improve their record to 21-9, matching last season and the 1976-77 season for the best 30-game start in the franchise's NBA history. Suns: Starting center Deandre Ayton missed a third straight game because of a sprained ankle. He's played in just two out of the team's first 30 games. ... Rubio returned to the starting lineup after missing Saturday's game against the Rockets because of an illness. ... The Suns fell to 1-6 this season in one-possession games.","401161093"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  For a Portland team looking to ride a five-game winning streak into Christmas, Monday night was a bad time for Damian Lillard to have one of the worst shooting games of his career. Jrue Holiday scored 21 points, Brandon Ingram had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans capitalized on Lillard's shooting struggles to beat the Trail Blazers 102-94. The Pelicans held Portland to just 48 points in the second half, the lowest mark the Pelicans have surrendered in a half this season, and won for the second time in three games. ""There's a big thing in the NBA about 3s and layups and we try to take away at least one of them,"" Holiday said. ""Tonight they had a lot of paint points but how they shot the 3 was in our favor."" Carmelo Anthony had 23 points and nine rebounds but Portland had its four-game winning streak snapped. Hassan Whiteside added 16 rebounds and 11 points. Portland's backcourt duo of Lillard and CJ McCollum was a combined 2 for 20 from the 3-point line. Lillard had an especially tough night, going 0 for 10 beyond the arc, the first time in his career that he's failed to make a 3-pointer while attempting at least nine. His previous low mark was 0 for 8 in his rookie season. ""First time for everything,"" Lillard said. ""Tonight was one of those nights. I've been scoring and shooting the ball well enough in this league where it's not something I'm about to go and stay up over."" The Blazers shot 13.8% from the 3-point line, tying a franchise worst in percentage with at least 25 attempts, going 4 for 29. New Orleans, on the other hand, was 15 for 35 from the 3-point line. The Pelicans outscored the Blazers 45-12 behind the arc. ""We were into it,"" Lillard said of his team's effort. ""But if you make four 3s and they make 15, it's going to be hard to win."" Derrick Favors had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Pelicans, while JJ Redick had 16 points. Anthony had 11 points in the first half of his return from injury, including a steal and 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer to tie the game at 31. However, Anthony's 3-pointer was the only one the Blazers made in 12 attempts in the first half. Lillard finished 6 of 21. He didn't make a field goal in the fourth quarter until there were 58 seconds left. The Blazers led 56-54 at halftime but the Pelicans made six 3-pointers in the third quarter and pushed the ball while Portland continued to struggle shooting the ball from the outside. Anthony had eight points in the third quarter to help keep Portland within single digits. A 3-pointer by Holiday gave the Pelicans a 95-88 lead with 7:09 left in the game. A dunk by Kenrich Williams gave the Pelicans their biggest lead of the game at 101-91 with 3:34 left. TIP-INS Pelicans: Zion Williamson hasn't played yet this season but while the Pelicans aren't giving many details about his rehab, Williamson looks like someone who is getting closer to playing condition. Williamson worked up a sweat on Monday night after going through a 20-minute workout prior to the game after participating the Pelicans' shootaround earlier in the day. ""He's done some stuff,"" Gentry said. ""But as I said we're taking it slow and he's working his butt off to get back out on the court. When the time comes, we'll put him out there."" The Pelicans say they will be overly cautious. Trail Blazers: After missing the better part of the last two games, the Trail Blazers got Anthony back. Anthony banged knees with an opposing player in Portland's win on Friday over the Orlando Magic and left after playing only 10 minutes. ""He's been working with the health and performance department over the last three games and it just gradually got to the point where he feels good to play,"" coach Terry Stotts said.","401161094"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  One week after setting a franchise record by coming back from 25 point down to win, the Houston Rockets nearly went the other way after taking a big lead against Sacramento. Like it has much of the season, Houston's defense made the difference down the stretch when the Rockets offense went silent. James Harden scored 34 points, Russell Westbrook had 28 and the Rockets overcame one of their worst fourth quarters of the season to beat the Kings 113-104 on Monday night. ""I thought we did a good job defending at a high rate, staying true to ourselves and leaning on our defense, not our offense,"" Westbrook said. ""We lean on our defense every night. We have obviously a great offense, a lethal offense, but we lean on our defense."" Clint Capela added 15 points and 14 rebounds as the Rockets won their seventh straight on the road. It didn't come easily. Two weeks after losing to the Kings on Nemanja Bjelica's buzzer-beating 33-footer, the Rockets squandered most of a 25-point lead before holding on at the end. That was in stark contrast to Houston's win over San Antonio on Dec. 16 when the Rockets rallied from down and beat the Spurs 109-107. ""A 10- or 15-point lead was like a five-point lead back in the day,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""They got hot and they did what they were supposed to do. We made some mistakes but a win here is a good win."" The Rockets won despite shooting 3 of 17 in the fourth quarter. All three baskets were 3-pointers, including one by Westbrook that put Houston ahead 107-96 after the Kings had pulled within six. Harden made a 3-pointer then added a pair of late free throws. ""We just got lax,"" Harden said. ""That's just human nature. You get up 18, 20 points and you start doing things that you weren't doing to gain the lead. It happens."" De'Aaron Fox tied his career-high of 31 points and had nine rebounds and six assists for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes added 12 points and 14 rebounds. The Kings have lost four straight. ""We didn't do the little things well enough tonight to win the game,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. Houston built a 16-point lead in the first quarter despite slow starts by Harden and Westbrook. The two took five shots total in the opening period and had nine points combined, while House and Capela handled the scoring load early. The Rockets big two got going after that. Harden scored 13 in the second quarter and Westbrook had 10. Houston pulled away in the third and led 86-61 following a short jumper by Harden. TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook's streak of 30 points or more ended at three games. . Ben McLemore scored eight points against his former team. McLemore was Sacramento's first-round pick (seventh overall) in 2013. Kings: Trevor Ariza had 12 points and six rebounds off the bench. . Bogdan Bogdanovic (right ankle soreness) did not play. HIELD SITS OUT FOURTH Buddy Hield is Sacramento's leading scorer but was on the bench the entire fourth quarter. He finished with 10 points on 3 of 12 shooting. ""I played the guys that had it going,"" Walton said. ""It wasn't a punishment at all. It was more, `Look, we're a team and we're trying to win out here and if these guys are going well, well then we keep rolling with them."" DON'T FORGET Westbrook said Bjelica's buzzer-beater on Dec. 9 was a source of motivation going into the game. ""We definitely had it on our radar and I made sure that we all knew that coming in,"" Westbrook said. MISSED FREEBIES Fox scored 19 in the fourth quarter but missed five free throws over the final 6 minutes.","401161095"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  For a team that went to the NBA Finals five straight years and came away with three championships over that stretch, it might not seem like much. But considering where the Golden State Warriors are at, winning consecutive games for the first time this season qualifies as progress. D'Angelo Russell scored 30 points, Alec Burks had 25 points and eight assists, and the Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-104 on Monday night. ""I think it's good man, in the way we're winning too,"" Russell said. ""We're growing. ""It's not like we just so happened to be making shots . we're getting better with the little things that we've found a way to lose games with. Rebounding, free throws, box (outs), all that little stuff."" Draymond Green added 14 rebounds and nine points and Damion Lee had 14 points for Golden State, which won consecutive games for the first time since last season's Western Conference finals. ""It feels ... amazing,"" Green said. ""I never thought I'd be so excited for two regular-season wins in my life."" Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points and Jordan McLaughlin had 19 for the Timberwolves, who dropped their 11th straight. Jeff Teague added 12 points for Minnesota. The Warriors broke open a tie game midway through the second quarter with an 18-3 run to take a 53-38 lead. Green scored on a hook shot with 2:30 left in the first half to cap the run. The Warriors opened up a 64-47 lead after starting the third quarter on a 7-0 run. The Warriors led 82-58 late in the third quarter on Omari Spellman's layup. Minnesota went on a 14-2 run to close within 84-72 early in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves closed to 109-104 with 22 seconds left when McLaughlin was fouled on a dunk and completed the three-point play with a free throw. The Timberwolves are 5-19 since a 125-119 win over Golden State on Nov. 8 in which Russell scored 52 points and Wiggins had 40. ""It's no secret we're in a funk right now,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Young team or not, we've got to learn lessons in this league, because you've got to go through hard times to get to where you want to be."" The Warriors are playing their best ball ahead of a Christmas home game against the Houston Rockets that will be seen by a national audience. ""We need this regardless of what's coming next,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""We just needed to win a couple of games in a row just to get a little momentum and feel good. Christmas is always a special day to play on, you know that everybody's watching. It's got a different vibe, a different feel, and our players will be really excited it'll be good to go into that game with momentum.""

"TORONTO --  Bostons Jaylen Brown celebrated Christmas with something he had never enjoyed before: a road win at Toronto. Brown scored 30 points, Kemba Walker had 22 and the Celtics beat the Raptors 118-102 Wednesday in the first Christmas Day NBA game played in Canada. It was good to get a win here on Christmas, said Brown, who made five 3-pointers and shot 10 for 13 from the field. Ive never won here period, so it was great to just get one. Enes Kanter had 12 points and 11 rebounds as the Celtics snapped an eight-game losing streak north of the border and became the first Atlantic Division opponent to win in Toronto in more than four years. The Celtics have won four straight to improve to 8-2 in December. Bostons Gordon Hayward returned to the starting lineup after missing the past three games because of a sore left foot. He scored 14 points in 26 minutes. Its still a little sore but its playable, Hayward said. Its good, its good. Fred VanVleet scored 27 points in the Raptors' second straight loss, and Chris Boucher had a career-high 24. We werent quite physical enough, I thought, for most stretches of the game, Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. The Raptors are 2-2 since losing center Marc Gasol (left hamstring), guard Norman Powell (left shoulder) and forward Pascal Siakam (groin) to injuries. Nurse had no update on the status of the trio, but acknowledged their absence is making life difficult. Scoring is not very easy for us right now, Nurse said. Its tough. Toronto had gone an NBA-record 34 games between home losses to division foes. The Raptors last home loss to an Atlantic team was a 111-109 defeat to the New York Knicks on Nov. 10, 2015. Kyle Lowry scored 14 points and Serge Ibaka had 12 for Toronto. The Raptors shot 8 for 23 from 3-point range. Kanter arrived dressed in a black t-shirt that read Freedom for ALL in white letters. He played outside the United States for the first time since visiting Toronto with the Knicks on Nov. 10, 2018. Definitely amazing, a smiling Kanter said. I just cant describe it with words. Just going out there was more than just a basketball game. For me, it was just going out there and living this freedom. Kanters outspoken criticism of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government led to his passport being revoked in 2017. Turkish prosecutors have accused Kanter of membership in a terror organization and issued an international warrant for his arrest. Kanter did not travel with the Knicks to London last January because he feared he could be killed over his opposition to Erdogan. After being traded to Portland in February, he did not join the Trail Blazers for their March 1 game at Toronto. The Raptors jumped out to a 10-0 lead as the Celtics missed their first five shots of the game, leading to a Boston timeout with 10:03 left in the opening quarter. After the stoppage, the Celtics outscored Toronto 28-9 to lead 28-19 after one. They hit us early but I thought we recovered well, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Brown made all five of his field goal attempts in the third, including three from long range, and scored 16 points. Boston led 88-69 through three quarters. TIP-INS Celtics: G Marcus Smart (eye infection) traveled to Toronto but was not active. Smart has missed the past seven games.  F Grant Williams dislocated his right index finger in the second quarter but returned before halftime.  F Jayson Tatum shot 1 for 10 in the first half. He finished 5 for 18 and scored 11 points.  Boston scored 11 points off seven Toronto turnovers in the first. Raptors: Toronto made a season-worst seven 3-pointers in a Dec. 9 win at Chicago.  Torontos only previous Christmas Day game was a 102-94 loss at New York in 2001. HOME SWEET HOME The road team won a Boston-Toronto game for the first time in 13 meetings. TAKE A CHANCE Boston outscored Toronto 24-4 in second-chance points. HOT SHOTS The Celtics shot 46 for 92 (50%). Boston is 8-0 this season when shooting 50% or better.","401161097"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid was unyielding under the basket, arms extended sky high as Giannis Antetokounmpo tried to plow through the All-Star center for a bucket. Embiid absorbed the contact and slapped the ball out of Antetokounmpo's hands, one of a bountiful of disruptive plays triggered by the big man. Embiid used a national showcase to play like an MVP, and the Sixers pushed around a Bucks team that had the best record in the NBA. ""A lot of people have kind of forgotten who I am,"" Embiid said. ""When I'm needed, I'm going to show up."" Embiid had 31 points and 11 rebounds in Philadelphia's first home Christmas game in 31 years, and the 3-point happy 76ers beat Milwaukee 121-109 on Wednesday. Tobias Harris sank five 3s, Josh Richardson and Furkan Korkmaz each had four and even Embiid hit three as part of Philly's franchise record-tying 21 3s (on 44 attempts) in its most complete game of the season. ""I think this team is designed for the playoffs,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""I believe the road we have traveled so far has been a little bit erratic, at times. But I think the landing spot is exciting."" Harris and Al Horford hit 3s over the final 90 seconds to push back a late Bucks run, and the Sixers improved to 16-2 at home. There was a charged atmosphere for the anticipated matchup featuring Embiid and Ben Simmons taking on Khris Middleton and Antetokounmpo. Fans dressed as elves, wore ugly sweaters and held signs that said all they wanted for Christmas was a Sixers win. They got it, with Embiid bullying the reigning MVP in Antetokounmpo on the way to the Sixers' biggest halftime lead (21 points) against the Bucks under coach Mike Budenholzer. ""It was just one of those nights,"" Budenholzer said. Embiid scored 23 points and was troublesome defensively, holding Antetokounmpo to 4-for-14 shooting in the half. The Sixers hit 11 3s in the half and made the NBA-best Bucks (27-5) look like anything but Eastern Conference contenders. Brown said before the game the Bucks were ""NBA royalty."" They have a ways to go before they're crowned tops in the East. With fans chanting ""Trust the Process!"" on Embiid free throws, the star center was worthy of the holiday highlight video. ""I reminded our team, people in America have more appreciation for this day in the NBA,"" Brown said. ""We're grateful for the opportunity."" The Sixers aced their test against the NBA's best. ""I'm not going to overvalue one game,"" 76ers general manager Elton Brand said, ""but it's a good barometer."" It wasn't just Embiid that flustered the Bucks. Korkmaz was knocked on his rear and buried Philly's 16th 3 of the game late in the third for a 93-67 lead that had the crowd going wild. Korkmaz's shot capped a string of 3s on five straight Sixers baskets. Mike Scott, the reserve better known for his man-of-the-people popup appearances, became the seventh Sixer to hit a 3 for a 98-70 lead. The 76ers led 100-73 through three. Middleton scored 31 points and Antetokounmpo had 18 points and 14 rebounds. Antetokounmpo got flustered over a perceived missed call on an eye poke and was whistled for a technical in the fourth. Antetokounmpo, who was 8 for 27 from the floor, 0 for 7 3s, said he briefly suffered blurred vision. ""We had to go through this today. We had to go down 30,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We had to have our character tested today because the only way you get better is when you face adversity. Our team is going to be better."" Brand held a state-of-the-franchise press conference before the game and preached chemistry and continuity would eventually get the Sixers among the best in the East, a conference many pundits picked them to win. ""We are going to get there,"" Brand said. ""Home-court advantage is important but having Joel healthy in the playoff in May, June, that is important to us. We could still grow into a team that could be a No. 1 seed."" For a game, the 76ers sure played like one. TIP-INS Bucks: The Bucks trailed by 29 and held only an early three-point lead. 76ers: Embiid had his seventh game this season with 30 points and 10 rebounds. He scored 20 points before halftime for the second time this season. ... Simmons had 15 points and 14 assists. ..

The former Wildcats star was named Final Four Most Outstanding Player in the '18 title run. ""There's two of them things. That's tough,"" he said.

"SAN FRANCISCO -- Damion Lee made a statement on a rare big stage this season for injury-ravaged Golden State. Lee had 22 points and a career-high 15 rebounds, Draymond Green scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half and the Warriors beat the Houston Rockets 116-104 on Wednesday. ""I'm thankful that we got the win, but there's still things that I feel I have to get better at day in and day out to fully solidify myself as an NBA player and not a two-way,"" Lee said. D'Angelo Russell added 20 points and Glenn Robinson III had 18 to help the Warriors win their third straight and end the Rockets' four-game winning streak. Golden State improved to 8-24. ""We're probably not going to play a bigger game than this all year,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""A national TV game against the Rockets. This game meant a lot to us."" Russell Westbrook had 30 points and 12 rebounds for Houston. James Harden had 24 points and 11 assists and Danuel House Jr. had 18 points. ""We had a lot of great opportunities that we just didn't convert,"" Harden said. ""It's pretty simple."" Westbrook had his ninth consecutive game of at least 20 points, the longest by any Rockets player other than Harden since Tracy McGrady did it in 10 straight games in 2007. ""For whatever reason we just didn't get it done,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It's too bad we didn't play with the spirit and energy we usually have."" Green also had 11 rebounds. He gave the Warriors the lead for good with just under five minutes left in the third quarter on a driving layup. ""It's been a really trying season for us,"" Green said. ""To come out Christmas Day and get a win against a very good basketball team feels good."" Ky Bowman hit a driving layup at the buzzer to give the Warriors an 92-87 edge heading into the final quarter. ""This felt like an opportunity for us and the guys seized it,"" Kerr said. ""I think the fans see how hard our guys are playing. Everybody is feeling great on Christmas Day to get that win."" After falling behind by eight points midway through the first quarter, the Rockets outscored Golden State 48-17 over the next 13 minutes to open a 53-40 advantage. Russell hit a short jumper in the final minute of the second and the Warriors drew to 68-64 by halftime. ""We were up by 13 in the first half and for some reason we decided to start fouling them and putting them on the line and that cost us,"" D'Antoni said. ""Defensively we gave up 64 points in the first half and that's not good enough."" CHRISTMASTIME IN THE CITY Kerr said playing on Christmas ""is definitely a special feeling. It's a great day already with a lot of good vibes in the air. It's nice to be home this year."" D'Antoni said: ""It's a special day for basketball; privileged to be able to play on these days.""

"Anthony Davis laments the Lakers allowing the Clippers to come from behind to get the win. (0:41) LOS ANGELES -- The Clippers were resilient and dominant in the second half to put away the Lakers, using the NBA's marquee Christmas game to show why the city and the Western Conference might belong to them this season. Kawhi Leonard scored 11 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter and had 12 rebounds and 5 assists to help the Clippers beat Lakers 111-106 on Wednesday night. The Clippers trailed by 12 points at halftime, by 15 in the third quarter, and by seven in the fourth quarter with 6 minutes, 39 seconds remaining, but they rallied to improve to 2-0 against the Lakers this season. ""And we didn't flinch,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Like, we just kind of hung in there. Almost felt like we were biding our time and just trying to make a run. That's something you have to have when things aren't going great for you. You just got to hang in there, and I thought we did that tonight."" Leonard set a franchise record for points on Christmas, and he became the 10th player in NBA history with at least 35 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists on Dec. 25. Montrezl Harrell had 18 points off the bench and Paul George added 17, and the Clippers are 15-2 at Staples Center. ""We have so many interchanging parts,"" Clippers guard Lou Williams said. ""We have guys that's going to have big nights. I think I had five or six points tonight, and that's just how this team is built. It's going to be different guys every night."" Kyle Kuzma led the Lakers with 25 points. LeBron James had 23 points, 10 assists and 9 rebounds, and Anthony Davis had 24 points. The Lakers have lost four consecutive games. Williams made two free throws -- after a questionable foul call against Davis for tapping the swingman after his transition layup rimmed out -- to give the Clippers a 105-103 lead with 3:29 to go. Leonard, who had a 3 to cap a 7-0 run and tie it at 101 with 5:14 remaining, then made four late free throws. ""They wanted it more,"" Davis said. ""We had a lot of mistakes down at the end of the game, mental mistakes at both ends of the floor. We fouled a lot in the fourth quarter, put them to the line. ... We gave that one away."" Los Angeles had a chance to tie in the final seconds, but video review showed James touched the ball last after Patrick Beverley knocked it away as James went up for a 3. George hit two free throws for the final margin. ""That wasn't the game right there,"" James said. ""I mean, it's a big play and you want to try to get it right, but it wasn't where the game was lost."" TIP-INS Clippers: Williams had six points and seven rebounds. ... The Clippers had a 50-42 edge in rebounds. Lakers: Kuzma had 15 points in the first quarter, making 5 of 7 shots, including 3 of 4 3s. ... The Lakers' bench outscored the Clippers' reserves 49-36. ... James played in his 14th Christmas Day game, second in NBA history to Kobe Bryant at 16. BIG RESPONSE After allowing a 14-2 run over the final 2:52 of the second quarter, the Clippers regrouped with nine different players scoring to tie it up at 86-all going into the fourth quarter. Defensively, they held the Lakers to 9-of-23 shooting in the third, including 1-of-10 from 3. ""We've done worse,"" Williams said of the struggles closing out the first half. ""We've dropped 15-point leads in three straight games before this, so I think that's just growing pains."" SANTA'S LAP There was plenty of star power sitting courtside for the highly anticipated game, including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and R&amp;B star The Weeknd. But Kevin Hart found himself closer to the action than expected when Davis missed a fallaway shot at the end of the first half and ended up on top of the comedian. James ran over from the bench and did the same, much to the amusement of Hart's kids.","401161100"
"DENVER --  Brandon Ingram had no clue how many 3-pointers he'd made until a voice from across the locker room informed him. Seven. An assist to injured rookie Zion Williamson for providing the pertinent information. Ingram scored 31 points, including a career-high in 3-pointers, and the New Orleans Pelicans surprised Denver 112-100 on Wednesday night to halt the Nuggets' seven-game winning streak. Rarely has Ingram's shot felt as pure as it did -- from deep anyway. ""It's been college and high school,"" Ingram said of his long-range accuracy. ""They (teammates) found me when I was open. I had the confidence to knock it down."" The 9-23 Pelicans are now 2-0 against the Nuggets this season. They spoiled the festive mood at the Pepsi Center as the Nuggets played at home on Christmas for the first time in 25 years. ""The character of our guys showed that although our record is what it is, we continue to play,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We will continue to play. I don't see any quit in these guys or anything like that. There's no fragmentation or anything like that."" New Orleans sprang the upset despite committing 19 turnovers that led to 27 points. The Pelicans pulled away late courtesy of the long-range shooting of Lonzo Ball and Ingram. They also out-rebounded the Nuggets, which included 14 offensive boards. Derrick Favors was a force in grabbing 13 rebounds and dishing out a career-best eight assists to go with eight points. ""He was huge,"" said Jrue Holiday, who had 20 points, six steals and eight assists. ""We ask him to do a lot, but he's doing it."" New Orleans finished a four-game trip with a 3-1 mark, which includes consecutive wins for the first time in a month. This was the first time the Nuggets have hosted on the holiday since 1994 when they beat Seattle 105-96 in front of a sold-out crowd at McNichols Arena. The fans at Pepsi Center didn't leave in a particularly merry mood. Then again, in the five Christmas games Wednesday, the home teams went 2-3. ""We got bullied on the boards. They dominated us with their physicality,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We don't have a match-up for Ingram. So I've got to do a better job helping our guys out."" Neither team led by more than eight points until Ball's 3-pointer with 4:07 remaining made it 104-95. That all but sealed the win. Nikola Jokic finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for Denver, while Jerami Grant had 17. The Pelicans also knocked off the Nuggets 122-107 on Halloween. ""They did the same stuff they did the first time we played them,"" Gary Harris said. ""We didn't bring the fight today."" This looked like an entertaining matchup when the NBA schedules were released. But that was before Williamson had surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee on Oct. 21. On Wednesday, Williamson sat on the bench dressed in a dark suit. The Pelicans have struggled without Williamson, while the Nuggets (21-9) have soared to one of the top marks in the West. Williamson did provide some valuable information to Ingram, who knew he made a few 3-pointers but didn't know the total. ""That,"" Ingram said, ""was when I found out."" TIP-INS Pelicans: G Josh Hart finished with 16 points. ... The Pelicans were 12 of 12 from the free-throw line. Nuggets: Former Nuggets standout and Denver native Chauncey Billups was part of the broadcast team for the game. ... Broncos pass rusher Von Miller was in attendance. REDICK'S SURGE JJ Redick scored 13 of his 15 points in the second quarter, including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from near half-court to give the Pelicans a 58-55 lead. Redick now has 1,799 career 3-pointers and moved past Klay Thompson for 16th place on the all-time list. The next name on the list is Kobe Bryant, who finished with 1,827. EARLY PRESENT On Christmas Eve, Malone agreed to a contract extension that runs through the 2022-23 season. He's fourth in franchise history in wins among head coaches. ""The players in there, my coaches, are a big, big part of that,"" Malone said of having his contract extended. ZION UPDATE Asked about Williamson before the game, Gentry said: ""He is making progress. He is in rehab. He is doing everything that he's supposed to do and he's moving forward toward playing.""","401161101"
"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons didn't want to take a six-game losing streak into their longest road trip of the season. Turns out, Pistons coach Dwane Casey and his banged-up squad were facing one of the few NBA teams dealing with even more injuries ahead of hitting the road. Blake Griffin had 14 points and a season-high 11 rebounds and Detroit ended a five-game losing streak with a 132-102 rout of the Washington Wizards 132-102 on Thursday night. ""We did a lot of good things, and now we've got to carry that on the road,"" Casey said. ""We knew we had a wounded team over there and I thought our ball movement was as good as it has been all season."" The Pistons were missing Reggie Jackson (back) and Luke Kennard (knee), while Griffin, Bruce Brown and Derrick Rose played through injuries. ""I thought we did all the little things right,"" Griffin said. ""We obviously weren't in a good spot with a five-game losing streak, but we just focused on tonight and making sure we played our game."" John Wall, Davis Bertans, Isaiah Thomas, Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura sat out for Washington. ""We didn't play well and they have a great game,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""They came back healthy and their bigs were a handful. We paid so much attention to (Griffin and Andre Drummond) that their guards took us out of a good offensive rhythm."" Detroit, which had already lost twice to the Wizards, got 14 points and 10 rebounds from Andre Drummond. Pistons coach Dwane Casey was able to use the lopsided margin to rest his key players, including sitting Griffin for the fourth quarter. Christian Wood finished with 22 points and Tim Frazier scored 18 for Detroit, which had eight players in double figures. The Pistons took 48 3-pointers, tying the franchise record set on Dec. 19, 2018, in a 129-123 overtime win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Frazier hit five of six attempts. ""Timmy has been in the league for five or six years, so he's got experience and he knows what is going on,"" Casey said. ""He was shooting well, but he also helped with our ball movement and pace."" Anzejs Pasecniks scored a career-high 17 in his fifth NBA game to lead the Wizards. Bradley Beal had 15 points before leaving the game in the fourth quarter. ""He had some soreness in his right lower leg, so we'll see how he feels tomorrow and evaluate it from there,"" Brooks said. ""He wanted to keep playing, but we were down big and thought it was wise to let him sit out the rest of the game."" Despite a makeshift lineup, the Wizards were able to stay close early, taking advantage of Detroit's defensive rebounding issues. Washington pulled down 45% of their own misses in the first quarter. But, the Pistons moved out to a 68-48 lead by halftime. The Pistons finished the game with rebounds on 67% of the Wizards' missed shots. That's still one of their four worst totals of the season, all of which have come in the last four games, but it was a significant improvement on the 59% they recorded in Monday's loss to the Chicago Bulls. ""Our biggest adjustment was getting after the ball,"" Casey said. ""It was a concern before the game and it was still a concern during the game. Everybody's got to do a better job, starting with the old-fashioned box out. We did a better job in the second half, but it is still an issue."" The Pistons have struggled all season in the third quarter. They were able to keep the momentum going against the Wizards, pushing their lead to 29 points, 89-60, midway through the period. Detroit led by as many as 34 points in the fourth quarter. ""We've got to go out there and play hard the whole game, and we didn't go hard and we weren't aggressive,"" Wizards guard Jordan McRae said. ""Against a team with big guys like Drummond and Griffin, you have to be physical. I don't think we were."" TIP INS Wizards: Washington was playing in Detroit on the day after Christmas for the second year in a row. In 2018, Beal and Wall combined for 42 points in a 106-95 loss. Markieff Morris had 12 points for the Wizards in that game and scored four for Detroit this year. Pistons: The team announced Thursday that Kennard will miss at least two weeks with knee soreness. Kennard had missed two of Detroit's last three games in an attempt to remedy the problem. WELCOME TO THE LEAGUE Louis King made his NBA debut for Detroit in the fourth quarter, finishing with two points and a rebound in four minutes. DEFENSIVE STRUGGLES Washington allowed at least 110 points for the 24th straight game, one short of the longest season-season streak since the 1990-91 Denver Nuggets did it in 28 straight games. The New Orleans Pelicans finished last season with a 25-game streak, while the 1990-91 Nuggets started a 24-game streak one game after breaking the 28-game run.","401161102"
"NEW YORK --  A local rivalry was supposed to go national Thursday, with the Knicks and Nets scheduled to play on TNT before the game was recently replaced. That turned out to be a wise decision because it was anything but must-see TV. Julius Randle had 33 points and eight rebounds, and New York forced Brooklyn into the worst shooting performance in the NBA this season in a 94-82 victory. Brooklyn finished 21 of 78 (26.9%) from the field. Chicago had the previous worst shooting game this season when it hit 29.9% against Toronto exactly two months earlier. ""They just outplayed us. Plain and simple,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""You could sit there and write and talk about missed shots -- we did miss lots of open shots -- but give them the credit. They simply were the better team tonight."" Marcus Morris added 22 points and eight rebounds for the Knicks, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Elfrid Payton scored 13 points as New York won for the first time in three meetings with Brooklyn this season. ""We were just sharp. To hold that team to 82 points, 14 points in the paint, is just really, really sharp,"" Randle said. ""We grinded the whole way, played a complete basketball game and we got the win."" The Nets' eight 2-point field goals were the fewest in an NBA game since 1950, when the Lakers and Pistons each made four shots from the field in a game with a final score of 19-18, according to Elias Sports. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 25 points but was only 5 for 15 for the Nets, who were held to their lowest point total of the season. ""For us, the target was to keep them under 100. We also shot 27 percent,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Maybe too much eggnog?"" The game even lacked the usual energy of a matchup between the city rivals, when there's almost always noise because both teams have plenty of fans in the building. This time, there were simply too many long spells when there was nothing to cheer from the sellout crowd of 17,732. The Nets hadn't played since Saturday and couldn't shake off their holiday rust. Randle scored 12 points in the first quarter, when his five baskets were as many as the Nets. Brooklyn shot 21% for the period and the Knicks led 24-15. That wasn't the Nets' only bad quarter. After they had cut it to 46-41 at halftime, they came out for the third and took more than eight minutes to make a basket. That allowed the Knicks to break it open with an 18-4 burst that extended an eight-point lead to 71-49 on Payton's layup. ""It is a tough task when you shoot like 25 percent,"" Nets center Jarrett Allen said. ""That makes playing defense much harder and running up and down the court harder."" Payton said he could sense the frustration in the Nets' body language during that third quarter, when the Knicks outscored them 33-20. ""You could feel it, you could see it,"" he said. ""And credit to us that we made some plays to kind of like seal the game."" Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot finally gave the Nets their first basket with a 3-pointer with 3:52 to play in the period, and he hit another later in the quarter, finishing with half of Brooklyn's baskets in the period as it went 4 for 12. TIP-INS Knicks: F Morris and C Taj Gibson were back in the starting lineup after missing the loss to Washington on Monday. Morris had a sore left Achilles tendon and Gibson was ill. G Dennis Smith Jr. was out with a strained left oblique. ... Mitchell Robinson had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Nets: Atkinson reported no change for Kyrie Irving, who missed his 19th straight game with a right shoulder injury. He said the All-Star point guard continues to work out on the court but they haven't gotten to the point where they can add contact, which would be the next step. He added that the Nets aren't at the point where they're thinking Irving will need surgery on the shoulder. ... Among the ugly nights for the Nets: Taurean Prince was 1 for 10, Garrett Temple 2 for 10 and Joe Harris 3 for 12. CARIS CLOSE Starting Nets guard Caris LeVert is moving closer to returning from right thumb surgery in November. Atkinson said LeVert just needs a little more work involving contact before he is ready to rejoin the lineup. He has missed the last 21 games. ""He did a lot of contact today,"" Atkinson said. ""Probably need a couple more of those sessions until he and our medical team, performance team feels like he's ready to go, but obviously getting much closer."" STILL ON TOP The Knicks' victory allowed them to keep a slim lead in the all-time series. The Nets would have evened it at 99 wins apiece with a victory. They had won the last four meetings.","401161103"

Jonas Valanciunas scored 21 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 20 and the Grizzlies held onto the lead this time in a 110-97 victory over the Thunder. Tyus Jones added 15 points off the bench on 6-of-7 shooting for Memphis, which blew a 24-point third-quarter lead during its last visit to Oklahoma City on Dec. 18 and lost 126-122. That started a stretch in which the Grizzles dropped three out of four games. ""Last time was disappointing, because we had a big lead and we lost it,"" Jackson said. ""We weren't able to respond. This time we made sure we responded the right way. We got a big lead again . then made sure we took care of the ball and made the right plays. ""That one stung before, so we definitely owed them one. I'm glad we got it done."" Chris Paul had 23 points and 11 assists, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 and Dennis Schroder added 20 points for Oklahoma City, which had a four-game winning streak snapped. The Thunder had beaten Memphis nine straight times at Chesapeake Energy Arena, a streak that dated to Nov. 14, 2012. ""They were rebounding on us and they were just making timely shots,"" Paul said. ""They made the floaters, the mid-range, the 3s. Honestly, we can look and see what we need to do better, but I think give them credit, too -- they played an all-around great game."" The burly Valanciunas went 9 of 11 from the field and fueled an 8-0 run early in the fourth quarter that essentially put the game away. Memphis shot 55% from the field and outrebounded the Thunder 50-34. Memphis didn't trail after the first quarter. The Grizzlies led by nine in the first and were up 49-47 at halftime. They extended their advantage to double digits for the first time at 79-67 on a 3-pointer by Jones with 2:53 left in the third and pushed their lead to 20 with 9:10 left after six straight points by Valanciunas. Oklahoma City pulled to 106-97 with 2:15 to go, but Schroder missed an open 3 on the Thunder's next possession and Valanciunas dunked at the other end with 1:25 remaining. ""We've had some tough endings the last (few games), but we don't dwell,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We move forward. Our guys are continuing to get better. The competitiveness is there every single night. But when you get that production, that competitive fire from all 11 guys, the unselfishness that we're talking about, the critical learning opportunities that we've had, in the fourth quarter to close out a win is huge for us."" Brandon Clarke scored 13 points for Memphis, going 5 of 6 from the floor. Steven Adams had 16 points for the Thunder.

"DALLAS -- Luka Doncic barely missed a step and added a little Magic on his return to the Dallas lineup on Thursday night. He had missed the previous four games because of a sprained right ankle. Doncic scored a game-high 24 points as the Mavericks beat the San Antonio Spurs 102-98. He finished with 10 rebounds and eight assists and barely missed adding to his NBA-leading total of eight triple doubles. He last had played on Dec. 14 against Miami. Against San Antonio, Doncic played 32:39, about half a minute more than his season average. ""I'm not going to lie,"" Doncic said. ""I was pretty tired."" Tired or not, he impressed Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ""I hate to say this, he's not Magic Johnson but it's Magic Johnson-like in the sense that he sees the floor in that same way. He's got a real intuitive sense and you can't teach that. He's just got it and he's great at it. I'm not trying to put the Magic Johnson pressure on him, he's not ready for that yet but he's doing a hell of a job."" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said that Doncic could have been even better. ""He had a few challenges early with rhythm and getting his legs under him. He got into a great flow as the game went on."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 17 points, Porzingis and Dorian Finney-Smith had 13 each, and Delon Wright added 12 off the bench for Dallas. Dwight Powell's 11 points all came in the first half.

The Mavericks led 79-74 after three quarters, and all but put the game away by making 7 of 9 3-point shots to start the fourth quarter. ""They had their little barrage there when they made six in a row, and that was the game,"" Popovich said. Doncic didn't make any of the seven in that barrage, but his presence was felt even then. ""He draws so much attention that he gets everybody else open,"" Porzingis said. ""We get good looks. It's up to the rest of us to knock down the shots or make the next play. ""It was good to have him back."" Doncic said his ankle was good. ""I'm going to keep icing it. I'm young. I just want to play. I don't want to miss no games."" The Mavericks (20-10) pulled within half a game of idle first-place Houston in the Southwest Division. Dallas scored the first eight points, with 3-point shots by Finney-Smith and Hardaway bracketing Doncic's first basket 1:23 into the game from short range. TIP-INS Spurs: They made only one of six 3-point attempts (17 percent) in the first quarter. On a positive note, San Antonio held Dallas to 2 for 10 (20 percent) during that time.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  As he watched Buddy Hield's last-second 3-point attempt clang off the back of the rim at the end of double overtime, Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins breathed a sigh of relief that was nearly a month in the making. For the first time in December, the Timberwolves won a game. ""All you could do was look and watch,"" Wiggins said. ""I was looking at the shot and it missed. Thank God."" Wiggins scored the first basket of the second overtime and then fed Robert Covington for another score, and Minnesota ended its 11-game losing streak by beating the Sacramento Kings 105-104 on Thursday night. Minnesota hadn't won since Nov. 27 before limiting Sacramento to 11 points in the fourth quarter and then outlasting the Kings in two overtimes. The Wolves did it without Karl-Anthony Towns, who missed his fifth straight game with a left knee sprain. ""We did a lot of great things tonight,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Our offense was not pretty tonight but we found ways. That locker room deserves to feel good."" Wiggins got the Wolves going in the second OT with a short jumper that started a 6-0 run. After Jeff Teague made a floater, Wiggins passed to Covington for a layup. Gorgui Dieng's dunk with 3:11 left put Minnesota up 105-99. Hield scored five straight points for Sacramento to close the gap, but the Wolves held on after Hield missed the potential game-winner. ""Winning in double overtime, winning in regulation, either way I would have took it,"" Minnesota's Treveon Graham said. Wiggins finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Dieng had 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Covington scored 19 for the Timberwolves. Richaun Holmes had 20 points and a career-high 18 rebounds for the Kings, who have their own injury concerns. De'Aaron Fox left two minutes into the first quarter with back spasms. Sacramento's point guard missed 17 games this season with an ankle injury sustained in practice. Marvin Bagley III limped off the court in the third quarter and was wearing a walking boot on his left foot after the game. Bagley had also recently returned after missing 22 games because of a broken right thumb sustained in the season opener. ""Give Minnesota credit. They knocked down some big shots when they had to and we didn't,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""We have to keep scrapping and fighting. We have to be better."" Both teams turned chances to win in the first overtime into turnovers. In the final 0.5 seconds alone, Teague threw away an inbounds pass and Bogdan Bogdanovic missed the rim on a 3-point try.

Wiggins had an emphatic one-hand dunk in the first quarter but clanged another attempt off the rim in the second. Kings: Fox had two points and two assists before leaving. ... Bagley, who had 18 points, was called for a technical after picking up his fourth foul. QUOTABLE ""There are some trust issues going on, I guess. Guys are now starting not to believe in players.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Joe Ingles was hot early and Donovan Mitchell had it going in the second half. But it took three big plays in the final three minutes by Rudy Gobert for the Utah Jazz to turn back the Portland Trail Blazers. Mitchell scored 28 of his 35 points in the second half to power the Jazz to a 121-115 win over the Trail Blazers on Thursday night, but it wouldn't have been possible without a few Gobert gems that won't jump out of a box score. ""Those hustle plays by Rudy really sealed the game. You can say what you want about my scoring, or Joe, but at the end of the day it came down to Rudy making two big plays. That's why he is who he is and that's why we rely on him,"" Mitchell said. Clinging to a two-point lead, Gobert used all of his 7-foot-9 wingspan to dive after a ball that was passing over the baseline and flick it to Bojan Bogdanovic for a 3-pointer from the corner with 1:45 to play. ""That was as good a play, as impactful a play as anybody's made all year,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Gobert, who had 16 points and 15 rebounds, forced Carmelo Anthony into an air ball with 22.4 seconds remaining and blocked Damon Lillard's driving shot with 5.2 seconds left to quell the Trail Blazers' furious fourth-quarter rally. ""Those two guys (Lillard and McCollum) -- when they get going, they're not easy to stop. We knew we were going to need those key stops to win the game,"" Gobert said. Lillard scored 34 points, including a pair of 30-foot contested 3-pointers in the final minutes, and CJ McCollum tallied 17 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter for the Blazers (14-18), who have dropped two straight after winning four in a row. McCollum, who struggled with his accuracy all night, finally made a jumper to cap a 10-0 Portland spurt to draw within 100-93 with 7:23 to play. ""We came out of the huddle saying, `No worries ... keep competing and try and put pressure on them and steal the game.' I thought we did that. We just came up short,"" Lillard said. Gobert made a basket and a free throw, but McCollum scored five more points in a 7-0 run to trim the lead to 103-102. But Mitchell seemed to have an answer for every improbable Blazer shot down the stretch. The Jazz (19-12), who have won six of the last seven games, took their largest lead at 86-63 after Gobert's push shot in the lane. Lillard scored eight straight points but Mitchell wouldn't let Lillard go on one of his epic runs without a response. ""(Mitchell) was poised. I think he made the right play. Didn't settle for jump shots. He attacked the rim, drew some fouls, and won us the game on that end,"" Gobert said. CLARKSON DEBUTS Cleveland traded Jordan Clarkson to the Jazz for guard Dante Exum and two future second-round draft picks on Tuesday. Hours after passing his physical, Clarkson checked in with 4:05 left in first quarter and made a pull-up jumper off the dribble, a minute later. That's not a shot Jazz fans have seen Exum take. He got nine attempts in his 11-minute stint and scored 9 points but missed all three of shots in the second half. ""He has a hunger about him,"" Snyder said. Exum, the No. 5 overall pick in 2014, didn't play in his last six games. KING OF THE RIM PROTECTORS On Saturday, Hassan Whiteside proclaimed he was the best rim protector in the league and ""it wasn't even close."" Of course, two-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert believes otherwise even though Whiteside leads the league in blocks with 78. ""Rudy takes a lot of pride in being able to defend in a lot of different ways,"" Snyder said. The Jazz made 17 of 22 shots at the rim and 13 of 19 on other shots in the lane. Portland was outscored by 28 points in Whiteside's 22 minutes on the court. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard, who missed all 10 3-point attempts in Monday's loss to New Orleans, made three 3s by halftime and had 17 points. He made seven 3s by the end of the game... Portland outscored Utah 26-7 in the first 7:20 of the fourth quarter. ... Both Anthony and Royce O'Neal committed in-bound fouls in the final 18 seconds resulting in a free throw and the ball. Jazz: Ingles was so hot to start the game, he let the Trail Blazers know it and was hit with a taunting technical. ... Mike Conley missed five games with a sore hamstring. He then re-injured it in his first game back and has missed four more games. ... The Jazz waived Jeff Green on Tuesday and signed Rayjon Tucker from the Milwaukee Bucks' G-League affiliate. Tucker didn't play Thursday.","401161107"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics have quite a young pair of stars developing in Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. Brown matched his career high with 34 points, Tatum had 24 of his 30 points in the opening half and the Celtics cruised to their fifth straight victory, 129-117 over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. They both have been able to do a lot and have consistently grown and gotten better, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. But I dont think we saw anything today that we havent seen out of both those guys in the last couple weeks, the last couple months. Theyve been playing well, and they obviously are playing confidently and feel good. Brown posted the first consecutive 30-point games of his career. He had 30 in a Christmas Day win at Toronto. He also scored 34 points in a playoff loss at Milwaukee on April 22, 2018. I think that the both of us together, its hard to scheme and stop us both, Brown said. We just come out and try to be aggressive. Days like today they couldnt stop either of us. Enes Kanter added 14 points and Kemba Walker had 13 for Boston, which improved to 13-1 at home. Kevin Love equaled his season high with 30 points and had seven rebounds for the Cavaliers, who had won their last three games and four of six. Collin Sexton added 21 points. Every time I watch Boston, Im very envious of what they have out there, and remind myself they were much like us five years ago, Cleveland coach John Beilein said. They just have so many, four guys out there that are explosive, can score at any time. The Celtics only trailed in the opening minutes and led 62-47 at halftime. Boston closed the first quarter by scoring the final seven points, taking a 33-22 lead into the break after Tatums 3-pointer with 4.9 seconds left. The Celtics then had a 10-0 spree midway through the second, turning a 12-point lead to 48-26 on Tatums step-back 3 from the right wing. Yeah, you see progression from both of those guys, and theyre going to continue to get better because theyre so young and hungry to get better, Love said of Bostons emerging pair. After intermission, Boston maintained a double-digit lead for the entire third quarter, building it to 84-62 on Kanters layup midway in before Love helped the Cavs slice it to 92-81 after three. Cleveland finally got its deficit into single digits early in the fourth, but Boston put it away when Brown nailed consecutive 3s from the left wing 25 seconds apart that made it 108-90 with just over seven minutes to play. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Guard Dante Exum, acquired with two second round-picks from Utah for guard Jordan Clarkson, made his debut with Cleveland. He wore No. 1 and scored nine points in 15 minutes. Obviously trying to learn a new system in two days is tough, he said.  Sexton has scored at least 20 points in five of the last seven games.  Cleveland came in averaging 111.9 points per game in its last seven. Celtics: Marcus Smart missed his eighth straight game with an eye infection. Stevens said before the game that Smart hasnt been ruled out for Saturday yet.  Gordon Hayward tied his career high with 39 points in Cleveland on Nov. 5. On Friday, he had seven points and eight assists in his second game back after missing three with a sore left foot. STRONG START Tatum went 9 of 13 from the floor and connected on 4 of 6 from 3-point range in the opening half. TRY AGAIN The Celtics improved to 3-0 against the Cavaliers this season. The teams final regular-season meeting is March 4 in Cleveland.","401161108"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  After 15 seasons in the NBA, Chris Paul said there's nothing that beats playing in the fourth quarter. After making some clutch plays in it Friday, he had enough left to come up big in overtime. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 27 points, Dennis Schroder added 24 off the bench and Paul had 10 of his 16 points after the third quarter as the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Charlotte Hornets 104-102 for their fifth win in the last six games. ""I love it man,"" Paul said. ""I kept telling Shai, 'All right, it's the fourth quarter and we will turn it on.' And that's the thing that gets your blood flowing, those fourth-quarter situations."" Paul didn't put up gaudy numbers in his nearly 35 minutes of action, finishing just 6 of 20 from the field. But he contributed seven rebounds, six assists and gave the Thunder the floor general and playmaker they needed down the stretch after his team let a 16-point lead slip away in the fourth quarter. ""He was great,"" said Thunder coach Billy Donovan. ""He made obviously some big shots and some big plays. ... He made some key shots coming down the stretch."" Paul, a North Carolina native who was playing in front of his father, brother and grandparents who were sitting courtside, hit two jumpers in the final 1:06 of regulation. Then he knocked down a pull-up jumper in overtime to give the Thunder a five-point lead. He also had three rebounds in the extra period. Said Hornets coach James Borrego: ""Chris Paul is a handful -- he's still a handful."" Terry Rozier scored 26 points and Devonte Graham had 15 points and 13 assists for the Hornets, who finished 7 of 39 from 3-point range after missing their first 18 attempts from beyond the arc. Steven Adams tipped in a miss by Paul to give the Thunder a 103-99 lead in the extra period, but Graham answered with a quick 3 from the top of the key. The Hornets fouled Gilgeous-Alexander, who made one of two free throws with 8.4 seconds left, giving Charlotte a chance to win or send the game into a second overtime. But Charlotte's inbounds play went awry as Graham slipped trying to get the ball. P.J. Washington improvised and drove to the basket and was fouled with 1.9 seconds left. But Washington missed the first free throw badly to the right and was forced to try to miss the second. Washington's second shot hit the front rim, but the Hornets were unable to corral the rebound and get a shot off as time expired. ""I think we came out really sluggish,"" Washington said. ""Missing shots, missing assignments on defense, just watching ball, watching the offense. We could have done a better job of that coming in, so we just have to get better from the start of the games and just have to maintain that for the whole game."" The Thunder got off to a slow start, failing to score until nearly five minutes into the game after missing their first eight shots from the field and both free throw attempts. But Oklahoma City still managed to build a 16-point lead in the first half largely because the Hornets struggled from long distance. TIP-INS Thunder: Adams had 14 points and 12 rebounds. ... Bench outscored the Hornets' 47-26. Oklahoma City's bench has outscored its opponent's reserves in 24 of 31 games this season. Hornets: Washington returned to the starting lineup after missing the last five games with a fractured finger on his right hand. ... Graham has increased his scoring output by 14.6 points over last season. No one else in the league is averaging more than an 8.4-point improvement. ODD ENDING TO REGULATION Overtime started in an odd way with the Thunder getting a free throw after Rozier was assessed a technical foul for throwing the ball into the crowd at the end of regulation. Donovan said he'd never seen a technical free throw attempt before the start of an overtime period. Rozier called it a ""silly technical"" on his part. GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER DOING MORE Gilgeous-Alexander led Oklahoma City in scoring again, but Donovan was most impressed with his post defense late in the game when the Thunder went to four guards. He had two steals that helped change the momentum in the final three minutes of regulation. ""That was really critical because they had a lead at that point and time and those couple steals kind of got us back in control and we got some momentum,"" Donovan said. ""It was two consecutive steals on two post-ups, so those plays were big when we were small.""","401161109"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic could've had a smoother finish, though they couldn't complain about their performance the rest of the night. Evan Fournier scored 20 points and the Magic survived a collapse from the free throw line in the final minute to squeeze out a 98-97 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday. ""The end wasn't great, but we can clean that up,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""That's a good win against a good team."" Aaron Gordon had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 12 rebounds for Orlando, which won its second straight. ""It felt like Magic basketball tonight as far as the defense and preparation,"" Fournier said. ""They are one of the top teams in the East and we were ready for a fight. We need to be like that every night."" Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris each had 24 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Embiid missed a desperation 30-footer at the buzzer that could have won it. Orlando led 93-83 after Gordon's dunk with 1:49 left in the game, but it was far from over. The Magic were 5 of 11 from the free throw line in the final 1:30. That included four misses in the final 30 seconds. Philadelphia's last four field goals were 3-pointers that gave the visitor's a chance at winning. Embiid hit the last of them with 5.1 seconds to play that cut the Sixers' deficit to 98-97. Ben Simmons then stole the inbounds pass at the Magic end of the court and gave it to Embiid, who launched his desperation shot as the buzzer sounded. It was short and left and Orlando survived. ""If I'm open I'm going to shoot it,"" Embiid said of his late-game offensive burst. ""That's the mentality you have to have. I didn't make the last one so it doesn't matter."" The game was a defensive struggle from start to finish. Most possessions were a battle to find an opening somewhere before the 24-point shot clock expired. Philadelphia had a 47-46 lead at halftime and pushed it to 62-54 early in the second half with the first offensive burst of the game. Embiid had seven points and Harris five as the Sixers took advantage of five Magic turnovers in a three-minute stretch to establish their biggest lead of the game. Orlando returned the favor, running off nine straight points off Sixers miscues. Vucevic's layup put Orlando up 63-62 and Orlando nursed that the rest of the quarter, taking a 71-68 lead into the fourth. ""It was a playoff-type movement as far as the physical side of it and I thought we responded with a D-minus,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""It was a statement thing, a physical thing and we responded poorly."" Both teams spent the first half searching unsuccessfully for a hot hand. Philadelphia's 39-34 lead in the middle of the second quarter was the biggest either team could muster before halftime. There were 13 lead changes and eight ties as the defenses got the best of the action. TIP-INS 76ERS: Philadelphia, which scored 30-plus points in 10 of its previous 12 quarters, had a high of 29 against the Magic. . Simmons has 38 assists in his last three games. . The Sixers had a chance to tie the game with 24 seconds left, but Simmons turned the ball over on an inbounds play.

"ATLANTA --  Khris Middleton scored 23 points, Ersan Ilyasova had season highs of 18 points and 17 rebounds and the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks overcame Giannis Antetokunmpo's absence to beat the Atlanta Hawks 112-86 on Friday night. Antetokunmpo, the league MVP last season and second-leading scorer this season, sat out because of back soreness.  He watched from the bench as his teammates helped Milwaukee improve to 28-5 overall and 13-3 on the road. The Hawks lost their ninth straight to drop to a league-worst 6-26. They lost guard Trae Young, the NBA's fourth-leading scorer, to a right ankle sprain late in the second quarter. He had to be helped off the floor  and was ruled out for the rest of the game. Brook Lopez had 19 points for Milwaukee to match his season high. Allen Crabbe led the Hawks with 20 points in a reserve role. Starting forward John Collins, Atlanta's second-leading scorer, finished with nine points and missed 10 of 14 shots from the field. Ilyasova's 3 at the 6:25 mark of the third put the Bucks up 78-46. With his team trailing by 30 a couple of minutes later, Atlanta's DeAndre' Bembry stole the ball and missed a dunk. The Bucks improved to 26-3 since Nov. 1 and are 2-0 without Antetokoumpo, who missed a Dec. 11 win over New Orleans with right quad tendon soreness. Middleton, Lopez and Ilyasova, who started in Antetokounmpo's spot, sat out the fourth quarter with a comfortable lead. TIP-INS Bucks: It was unclear before the game how time Antetokounmpo will miss.

"MIAMI --  Erik Spoelstra warned his team before the game that matchups between Indiana and Miami tend to get decided by a loose ball somewhere. Sure enough, he was right. Goran Dragic scored in the lane with 6.8 seconds remaining to cap a wild finish, and the Heat improved the NBA's best home record to 14-1 by defeating the Pacers 113-112 on Friday night. Dragic's shot was the third by Miami on the go-ahead possession, after Jimmy Butler and Kendrick Nunn both missed but the Heat were able to grab offensive rebounds to keep hope alive. Those were Miami's final two boards on a night where the Heat outrebounded the Pacers 56-34. ""Those last two rebounds, those plays speak for themselves,"" Dragic said. ""We're never going to give up."" Aaron Holiday had a chance to win it for Indiana, but his 10-footer -- well defended by Derrick Jones Jr. -- with about a second left bounced away. The lead changed hands five times in the final 2:21. Butler scored 20 points for Miami. Bam Adebayo had 18 points and 15 rebounds, including the offensive board that set up Dragic's shot. Nunn scored 17, Dragic had 14 and Tyler Herro scored 10. ""We knew it would be a grind,"" Spoelstra said. Duncan Robinson had 18 points, all on six 3-pointers to reach 101 for the season. He reached the century mark in 31 games, four games faster than anyone else in Heat history. Damon Jones needed 35 games in 2004-05. Aaron Holiday scored 17 for Indiana, which got 16 from TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb, 14 from Doug McDermott, 13 from Myles Turner and 11 apiece from Justin Holiday and Edmund Sumner. ""It comes down to two plays we have to execute and we didn't,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""That defensive possession where if we get a stop and we get the rebound and possibly win the game. I think they got three offensive rebounds on that possession and then we have the last possession of the game and we don't score. You have to make those plays and we didn't do that."" The Heat stretched their lead to nine points on two occasions early in the fourth quarter -- first on a 3-pointer by Dragic, the second on a 3 by Herro. And both times, Indiana answered with 3s of its own to avoid letting Miami pull away; Sumner hit the first, McDermott hit the second and then connected again with 8:44 left to trim Miami's lead to 96-93. That set up the down-to-the-wire finish, and the Pacers couldn't get the bounce. ""We'll take that shot any day,"" McDermott said. ""Aaron, we have a lot of faith in him, he's a great scorer, and that's why we want the ball in his hands."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana committed only four turnovers, tying a franchise record. ... Malcolm Brogdon tested his balky hamstring Friday morning, but was not cleared to play. ""Still a little sore,"" McMillan said. ... Turner had four fouls, all of them against Butler. ... Indiana was looking for a fourth straight win at Miami, something the Pacers had done only once before. Heat: His latest suspension over, Dion Waiters was active but didn't play.

"SAN FRANCISCO --  With four consecutive wins, Golden State coach Steve Kerr joked that there is really no stopping the Warriors. ""You can only hope to contain us right now,"" Kerr said with a grin. That's how good things are going these days for the worst team in the Western Conference. Small winning streaks, which use to be taken for granted while Golden State was winning three NBA titles in five years, are now a rarity worth chucking over. D'Angelo Russell had 31 points and six assists, and the Warriors rallied from 10 down in the fourth quarter to beat the Phoenix Suns 106-95 on Friday night. Damion Lee added 16 points, Alec Burks scored nine of his 13 in the fourth quarter, and Draymond Green had 11 points and seven rebounds. ""I just think we've got a little momentum and our guys are feeling it,"" Kerr said. ""Just stayed with it. At this point we believe we can win down the stretch. We've definitely taken a step forward in that regard."" Two days after beating Houston on Christmas, the Warriors trailed for most of the second half against Phoenix and were down 86-76 with 7  1/2 minutes remaining. Russell started the comeback with a pair of free throws and Burks followed with a three-point play. Burks later had an assist on Willie Cauley-Stein's alley-oop dunk. Phoenix led 89-87 before Golden State went on an 8-0 run. Glenn Robinson III's putback dunk following a miss by Russell put the Warriors ahead for good 91-89. Russell shot 10 of 25 while topping 30 points for the sixth time this season. ""We're getting better as a team,"" Green said. ""A month ago we would have lost this game by 40 with the way we were playing in the first half. We were able to stick around. When you stick around the way we did, eventually shots will fall."" Devin Booker scored 34 points for Phoenix. The Suns committed 27 turnovers and have lost eight straight. ""We put ourselves in situations where we weren't playing good,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""I thought we would play with more energy and an edge. We just have to be more solid."" The Warriors, who lost to the Suns 121-110 on Oct. 30, have won 19 of 21 against Phoenix. Booker, who was limited to 11 points in a loss to Denver on Monday, had 17 in the first half against Golden State, including a one-handed dunk that put the Suns ahead 47-38. Booker later banked in a 16-footer to give Phoenix a 51-43 halftime lead. After Booker had his shot blocked from behind by Golden State's Ky Bowman, Mikal Bridges scooped up the loose ball and scored on a three-point play. Bridges added a 3-pointer that -made it 74-63.

"DENVER -- Nikola Jokic scored at the beginning and passed in the end, and the Denver Nuggets needed every bit of what he provided to avoid a big collapse. Jokic scored a season-high 31 points and added 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his seventh triple-double of the season, leading the Nuggets to a 119-110 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night. Jokic, who has 35 career triple-doubles, has 11 double-doubles in the last 12 games, helping Denver win eight of its last nine. Will Barton had 20 points and Jamal Murray and Mason Plumlee each scored 15 for the Nuggets, who allowed 42 points in the fourth quarter. ""In the first quarter, they score 11 points and in the fourth they score 42,"" said Jokic, who had 14 points in the first. ""It's a huge difference. We have to be focused on closing the halves, closing the quarters, closing the games."" Memphis shot 61.5% in the fourth quarter and 60.4% in the second half after hitting just 3 of 14 shots in the first quarter. ""It was a tough first quarter for us,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We weren't able to get a lot of shots to fall, both layups and 3s during the first quarter and a half. But I love our resolve."" Denver never trailed and led by as many as 23 points in the first half when its two 7-footers, Jokic and Plumlee, sat with three fouls each. The Grizzlies made a run and closed within 50-39 at the end of the first half, with the final points coming on a dunk by Brandon Clarke just before the horn. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 20 points, De'Anthony Melton had 17 off the bench and Ja Morant scored 16 points. The Grizzlies missed 20 of their first 25 shots and went 20 for 33 to close out the third quarter. ""A lot better ball movement and a lot of side-to-side play,"" Jackson said of the improved shooting. ""When we trust our ball movement and trust our pick-and-rolls we just have much more action with more rhythm and everyone gets open looks."" Memphis closed within 52-49 early in the third quarter, the closest it had been since early in the first. Denver went on a 16-4 run later in the period and took a 14-point lead into the fourth. ""Unfortunately, it's another game we blew a big lead and made things more interesting than they needed to be,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Jonas Valanciunas had eight of his 14 points in the first three minutes of the quarter to get Memphis within eight. Denver went ahead by 14, but a 3-pointer by Jackson cut it to 102-95 with 5:15 left, but the Nuggets scored the next six and held off the Grizzlies. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Valanciunas had 10 rebounds. ... Have lost four straight and 31 of their last 38 games played in Denver. ... Memphis made more free throws (13) than field goals (12) in the first half. Nuggets: F Paul Millsap was out with a left quadricep contusion. Millsap missed two games earlier in December with a similar injury. .... Plumlee made his first start of the season after coming off the bench for 30 games. ... Mallory Pugh, a member of USA team that won the women's World Cup last summer, took the ceremonial free throw before the opening tip. DYNAMIC NIKOLA Jokic had five of his 10 assists in the fourth quarter, including a no-look pass to Jerami Grant for a layup. He also had an alley-opp to Murray, and then rewarded Murray for a backdoor cut that led to another dunk. ""He's playing at a high level and it's really lifted our team,"" Plumlee said. ""He always does one or two things a game that are impressive."" NO FREE PASS Denver didn't attempt a foul shot in the first half, while the Grizzlies were 13 of 16 from the line. It is the second time this season a Memphis opponent has shot one or fewer free throws. The Nuggets got their first attempts from the line when Jokic hit a pair with 10:47 left in the third.

It didnt sit well with me on Christmas Day, McCaw said. We definitely didnt give it our best effort and I think tonight guys took it personally. It wasnt talked about. Guys just went out and gave it their all. Kemba Walker led the Celtics with 30 points, and Jaylen Brown had 17 after getting consecutive 30-point games for the first time in his career. Brown had a career-high 34 in a win over Cleveland on Friday. We beat those guys two times already (this season), and obviously a few days ago on Christmas, Walker said. They definitely remembered that, of course. But those are the defending champs. Theyve got a target on their back, you know? Theyre the team to beat. They came in like they were the defending champs tonight. Playing their first game since losing by 16 to the Celtics on Wednesday -- the first NBA game in Canada on Christmas -- the Raptors never trailed in breaking a two-game losing streak. I think we just wanted to go out there and kind of compete a little better than we did on Christmas, Lowry said. Toronto was without two of its top four scorers due to injuries -- Pascal Siakam (groin) and Norman Powell (left shoulder subluxation). Siakam leads the team with 25.1 points per game, and Powell is averaging 14.4. They also were missing center Marc Gasol (left hamstring). All three were injured in the same game, a Dec. 18 win at Detroit. The Celtics had used a 10-0 spree to slice a 13-point deficit down to 70-67 midway into the third quarter, but the Raptors -- like they did all night when Boston made a charge -- answered with a quick 8-0 spurt that was highlighted by consecutive 3s from McCaw and VanVleet. Toronto just raised their level of intensity and we werent ready to handle it, Brown said. The Raptors also had a 12-point lead cut to five late in the third. Toronto led by 10 after the third and Boston never threatened in the fourth. McCaws 3-pointer made it 109-92. TIP INS Raptors: It was the fifth straight game that the trio of Siakam, Powell and Gasol was sidelined.  They shot 71.4 % (15 of 21) in the opening quarter and led by 11 at the break.  Torontos loss on Christmas was the first either team had won on the road in 13 tries. Celtics: Guard Marcus Smart returned after missing eight games with an eye infection that spread to both eyes. He hadnt played since Dec. 6 and got a loud ovation when he entered midway into the opening quarter. He scored seven points in 23 minutes. BUZZER BEATERS Smart hit a 3 from the top of the key at the horn at the end of the first quarter and Walker hit one from the top closing the second. ROLLER COASTER Raptors coach Nick Nurse talked about his teams struggles without some key players the last few games. Weve had some up-and-down moments, he said. I think thats been the hardest part of it -- consistency. Weve seen it even in the same games. Weve looked awesome in eight or 10 minutes and then we look like we cant do anything right in three or four minutes. THATS NEWS TO ME When Boston coach Brad Stevens was asked about his team being the NBAs top rebounding club for the month, he paused and said: Us? Shocker. He didnt have an explanation for the statistic. I dont know, the balls bounced our way, I guess, he said. We havent changed anything on either side of the floor.","401161115"
"Seth Greenberg doubts Zion Williamson will last more than a decade in the NBA because of the challenges of maintaining his body type. (1:40) NEW ORLEANS --  Brandon Ingram and Jrue Holiday figured the Pelicans' free-flowing, up-tempo offense would flourish if they could start more possessions by getting stops on the defensive end. Recent evidence backs up that proposition. Ingram scored 24 points, Holiday added 20, and suddenly resurgent New Orleans beat the Indiana Pacers 120-98 on Saturday night for their third straight victory. ""It's important for us to think defense first,"" Ingram said. ""Everybody is feeling pretty comfortable in what they're doing on the defensive end and that's leading to a rhythm on offense. ... The confidence is just flowing all around the room."" JJ Redick scored 15 and Lonzo Ball 13, hitting four of eight 3-point shots as he continues to gain comfort with his new shooting motion this season. ""I'm just trying to make shots when it's open,"" Ball said. Derrick Favors added 10 points and 16 rebounds as New Orleans won for the fourth time in five games after having lost a franchise-record 13 straight before that. In each of their four recent victories, the Pelicans have allowed 100 or fewer points. ""Just a learning process that we had to go through,"" Holiday said, alluding to a New Orleans roster comprised mostly of new players, including four new starters. ""Defensively, man, we just built chemistry and have been able to go from there. ""It gives us a lot of confidence now,"" Holiday added. ""Going through obstacles is something that happens all the time in this league, so being able to push through together is a good thing."" Aaron Holiday scored 25 points and T.J. Warren 20 for the Pacers, who have started strong overall this season but have stumbled of late, losing three of four, including in Miami on Friday night. ""They were trying to run us out the gym and then we had a tough one last night,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""The pace was a little fast. Domantas Sabonis had 15 points and 16 rebounds for the Pacers, but Indiana managed to make just 38.8% of its shots (33 of 85) and committed 18 turnovers that the Pelicans' up-tempo offense turned into 24 points. ""We just needed to control the tempo tonight, but we couldn't hit any shots,"" McMillan said. New Orleans, by contrast, combined for 18 3s and the Pelicans shot 46.2% (43 of 93) overall. Indiana led by 13 after closing the first quarter on a 9-0 run that included Sabonis' 3 and pair of free throws. But Holiday's driving layup began a 9-0 Pelicans run to open the second quarter. Moore hit a 3 and Holiday capped the spurt with a turnaround jumper to cut the Pacers' lead to 32-28. New Orleans edged back in front when Redick's free throws capped a 6-0 spurt to make it 41-39, and the Pelicans maintained a slim lead from there before pulling away by outscoring Indiana 30-13 during the last eight minutes of the third quarter. TIP-INS Pacers: Missed 22 of 28 from 3-point range. ... Jeremy Lamb missed 10 of 12 shots, including all four 3s he attempted and finished with seven points. ... Indiana had just three players score 10 or more. ... Myles Turner and Doug McDermott each scored nine points. Pelicans: Josh Hart and E'Twaun Moore each scored 11, with Moore hitting three times from deep. ... Ingram and Holiday each assisted on seven baskets. ... New Orleans has played better defense lately, allowing fewer than 102 points per game during its last six games and going 4-2 in that stretch. HOLIDAY HISTORY With Jrue Holiday playing for New Orleans and his brothers Justin and Aaron playing for Indiana, the family was able to make NBA history when all three brothers were in the same game at the same time. ""It was cool. I beat `em and I got their jerseys,"" Jrue Holiday said, noting that he and his brothers also had a lot of family and friends at the game. ""Really just to have a moment together like that -- I mean, all three of us have never been on the court together at the same time just because of age difference."" While Justin Holiday, 30, and Jrue, 29, are about 14 months apart, Aaron is 23. ""Hopefully the next thing, we'll have red, white and blue on and be playing on the same team,"" Jrue Holiday said.","401161116"
"MIAMI --  They were down by five points twice in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. They wasted two chances to win in the last second of regulation, then found themselves trailing on two occasions in overtime. No problem. Nothing seems to faze the Miami Heat. Jimmy Butler had 25 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, plus the go-ahead free throw with 2.3 seconds left in the extra session, and the Heat found a way to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 117-116 on Saturday night to improve to an NBA-best 15-1 at home. ""We never give up,"" Butler said. ""Yeah, it's crazy,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We always fight back,"" Miami's Goran Dragic said. Correct on all counts. The Heat moved back into the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference and assured themselves of no worse than a split of the four-game regular-season series with Philadelphia -- after both teams went through a first in their franchise histories. Miami, which topped Indiana on Friday, won one-point games on back-to-back days for the first time. Philadelphia, which fell in Orlando on Friday, lost one-point games on back-to-back days for the first time. The last time the 76ers lost consecutive games -- ones that weren't on a back-to-back -- by exactly one point was in January 1995. ""To do lots of good things and then just at the end to make some plays you wished you had back makes it difficult to swallow,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. Dragic scored 19, while Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson each had 16 for Miami. The Heat improved to 6-0 in overtime games and 8-1 in games decided by five points or less. Joel Embiid had 35 points and 11 rebounds for Philadelphia, which has lost 10 of its last 14 on the road. Former Heat guard Josh Richardson had 17 points in his first time in Miami as an opponent, and Ben Simmons had 15 points and 11 assists. Butler got fouled by Al Horford on Miami's final possession, then made the second of his two free throws for what became the game-winner. Philadelphia's Tobias Harris had a good look at a corner 3-pointer as time expired, but it bounced off the rim. That alone was plenty of drama. But there was oodles more. The end of regulation was wild, with Philadelphia twice holding five-point leads in the final 1:47 and not being able to finish things off off -- then Miami missing a box-out that would have won the game in the last second. With Miami down by two, Butler punched the ball away from Embiid with 12 seconds left in regulation. It went to Herro, who made a 3-pointer with 6.9 ticks remaining to put Miami up one. Another free throw pushed the lead to two, when Richardson went to the line to tie the game. He missed the first and intentionally missed the second. Simmons swooped in to grab the rebound and score in one motion to tie the game. Miami had a chance to win it right there but misfired on an inbounds pass and to overtime they went. ""Obviously, we're disappointed,"" Simmons said, after Philadelphia fell to 1-2 against Miami this season and 4-10 in its last 14 road games. ""There are lots of things we have to work on as a team."" TIP-INS 76ers: Brown used his challenge with 1:53 left in the first half, arguing that Simmons did not commit what would have been his third foul against Bam Adebayo. He was correct. ... Embiid took off his sweaty jersey for a fresh one at the scorer's table before checking back in with 3:41 remaining in regulation. Heat: Butler was 1 for 6 in the first half, his only make coming with 1:10 left before intermission. ... Robinson started 6 for 6, including four makes from 3-point range, but committed his fifth foul with 5:16 left in the third. ... Miami has reached 100 points in all 16 games at home this season, tying the second-longest such single-season streak in team history. The Heat had 23 consecutive home games of 100 or more points from Dec. 7, 1991 to March 13, 1992. FAUX FIGHTS Richardson and Adebayo remain extremely close friends and got playfully rough with one another. Richardson made a 3-pointer in the second quarter while getting fouled by Adebayo, then gave his former teammate a swat on the backside before finishing off the four-point play. So in the third quarter, when Richardson fouled Adebayo to save what likely would have been a dunk, the Heat center had a few good-natured words and animated points toward him. ""That's my guy,"" Adebayo said. QUICK TURNAROUND Philadelphia scored 16 points in the game's first 8:55. It scored 17 points in the next 3:02, quickly turning an early eight-point deficit into a five-point lead after the opening quarter.","401161117"
"WASHINGTON --  Mike Miller took over a team with just four wins earlier this month and has already led the New York Knicks to five victories. The interim coach is deflecting all the credit, pointing to Julius Randle's play of late. Randle scored 30 points and equaled a season high with 16 rebounds, Bobby Portis added 17 points and the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards 107-100 on Saturday night. ""A little bit into the season, we're learning how to play off each other a little bit better. Playing a little faster,"" Randle said. ""I'm reading it better, getting to spots better, recognizing how they're playing me, playing at a better pace. Coaches are doing a better job of getting me in spots where I can be efficient."" Miller became interim coach on Dec. 7 after David Fizdale was fired with a 4-18 record. He is 5-6 in his first stint as an NBA coach. Randle has scored 35, 33 and 30 points in the last three games for a Knicks team that has won two in a row. ""He has been fantastic,"" Miller said. ""He's doing so many different things. But the scoring is all timely. It's when you need a basket. He's got such a confidence about him. He's making all the plays and he's really conscious of doing the other things. He's really impacting me."" Isaiah Thomas and Jordan McRae each scored 20 points for Washington. Gary Payton II, one of the two free agents the team signed this week who started, had 15. The Wizards played without Bradley Beal, the NBA's fifth-leading scorer, who was out with soreness in his right lower leg. Beal averages 27.8 points. Payton started in his place. ""Not playing with him is very hard,"" McRae said about Beal. ""He's a two-time All-Star. He averages 30 points. If he's not on the court, that's 30 points that we don't have."" There were 19 lead changes, and the final one came when Randle hit a jumper with 7:56 remaining to give New York (9-24) a 93-92 lead. The Knicks held Washington (9-22) scoreless for 5:51 in the fourth quarter. The Wizards scored just eight points in the final 8:19. TIP-INS Knicks: G Dennis Smith Jr. missed his second straight game with a left oblique strain. ... Portis was assessed a technical foul late in the first quarter. ... Held Washington to 34.4% from the field after holding Brooklyn to an NBA season-low 26.9% on Thursday. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks hopes that Beal will miss just a game. Beal's consecutive game streak of 194 was broken. He last sat out on April 12, 2017. ...Brooks said that Fs Davis Bertans (quad) and Rui Hachimura (groin), and C Mo Wagner (ankle) will all be out for at least the next week. ... Thomas returned after serving a two-game suspension for entering the stands to confront a fan. ... Johnathan Williams, the other free agent signed this week, had two points in 13 minutes in his first start. MILLER TIME Miller, who joined the Knicks' staff at the beginning of the season, was a college coach for nearly 25 years, and spent the past six years in the G League. At 55, he's not naive about the NBA and who sets the tempo. ""We work together on it, and the players make it easy,"" Miller said. ""How much they play and how well they play together and what combinations work. They're making a lot of those things happen for us."" PAYTON WANTS HIS PLACE TO BE THE NBA Payton was re-signed by the Wizards on Dec. 23. He had a 10-day stint with them last season. ""I've been hungry for it ever since I got here,"" Payton said. ""In and out of the G League and I'm trying to find somewhere to stick. I think these guys here appreciate what I do.""","401161118"
"CHICAGO --  Aside from the lingering effects of an illness, Lauri Markkanen was feeling just fine Saturday night. It's a far cry from early in the season when the third-year forward was struggling to find his comfort level in a new offensive system. Markkanen had 25 points, Zach LaVine added 19 and the Chicago Bulls nearly led wire-to-wire in a 116-81 victory over the short-handed Atlanta Hawks. Battling an illness and questionable until a few hours before the game, Markkanen was 8 for 14 from the field, making 4 of 9 3-pointers. ""I think he's starting to learn how we play, where he can get his shots,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""We've been coaching him on getting ahead of the ball and being more active, and I think he's done it."" After spending much of the previous two days in bed, Markkanen said he knew he could play after getting up and walking around in the afternoon. ""He looked fine to me,"" LaVine said. ""If he's gonna play like that, I think he should be sick more often. Once he knocked down the first couple, you have to look for him because we need to get in that rhythm."" Rookie Coby White had 18 points for Chicago. The Bulls have has won three of four. John Collins had 34 points for the NBA-worst Hawks. They have dropped 10 straight for the second time this season. Collins was playing his third game following a 25-game suspension for violating the league's doping policy. The Hawks played without scoring leader Trae Young. He didn't make the trip after spraining his right ankle in the second quarter Friday night in a home loss to Milwaukee. ""The head of the snake is off,"" Collins said referring to Young. ""He brings all the pop, the swagger. Missed him tonight, for sure."" The Bulls sweep the three-game season series between the teams, winning all three by at least 20 points. ""Another rough night in Chicago,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Another back-to-back where we just didn't have it."" Atlanta scored the first two baskets for a 4-0 lead, but Chicago answered with 14 straight points. Markkanen had seven points during the run and capped it off with a 3-pointer for the 14-4 advantage. The Bulls led 35-19 at the end of the first quarter and increased it to 64-43 at halftime. Markkanen and LaVine combined for 31 points on 14-for-24 shooting, including 6 for 10 on 3-pointers. Chicago led 83-65 after three quarters. White then opened the fourth with five quick points for an 88-65 edge. ""I know where I'm gonna get my touches and shots,"" Markkanen said. ""It's the same guys, the same system. Obviously, we work on it every day, so it has to become more comfortable. ""I think everyone is figuring out their role and doing a good job of it."" TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce said Young was feeling better Saturday, but he had no idea how long the second-year guard would be sidelined ... F Jabari Parker, a Chicago native and former Bull, missed his second straight game with a right shoulder impingement ... Alex Len returned after missing Friday's game with a sprained left ankle. He finished with 10 points in 20 minutes. Bulls: C Wendell Carter Jr. was 2 for 3 on 3-pointers in the game. Before Saturday, he was 3 for 19 from behind the arc ... Chicago was 26 for 42 from the field in the first half, including 8 for 15 on 3-pointers. CARTER TRIBUTE The United Center P.A. announcer gave Atlanta guard Vince Carter a special introduction when he entered the game midway through the first quarter. The scoreboard also showed a graphic listing a few of Carter's accomplishments during his 22 seasons in the NBA. Barring a trade, this was Carter's final regular-season game in Chicago. He received a loud ovation when he exited the game for the final time with under two minutes left. MOVING UP IN CLASS After facing the worst team in the league, the Bulls host the Milwaukee Bucks, Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics in three home games next week.","401161119"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden was glad the Houston Rockets stepped up late defensively to get a win over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. However, Houston's star wishes it wouldn't have come to that. Harden had 44 points and 10 rebounds and the Rockets built a big early lead and withstood a late rally from the Nets for the 108-98 victory. Houston has won five of six games, with its only loss in the stretch coming in a surprising defeat by the Warriors on Christmas day. The Rockets, who led by as many as 22, had a five-point lead before Austin Rivers scored all of their points in a 5-2 run that pushed the lead to 104-96 with about 2 1/2 minutes left. Spencer Dinwiddie added a layup for the Nets after that, but Harden hit a 3-pointer with less than a minute left to stretch the lead to 107-98. We were able to guard when we need to but we were up 22 points, Harden said. We've got to somehow, some way figure out how to maintain that earlier in the game and then we won't have to worry about it in the fourth quarter. Coach Mike D'Antoni said their struggles on offense later in the game helped give the Nets life to get back into it. We couldn't hit a shot for a while, but the last four or five minutes the defense was good, he said. You've got to be able to rely on defense when the shots don't go and I felt like tonight we did. Russell Westbrook and Taurean Prince were both ejected with about 20 seconds to go when they started yelling at each other after Prince fouled Westbrook. The Nets were led by Dinwiddie, who had 17 points and 11 assists, and got 16 points each from Prince and Jarrett Allen as they lost their second straight. We gave ourselves a chance, but the other side of the coin is I don't think we're playing very well, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. That's the second game in a row where I feel like we're out of sync. I don't know what it is. We're just not in rhythm right now, especially offensively. A big run by the Nets allowed them to take a 1-point lead with about nine minutes left when Houston finally rediscovered its offense after cooling down following a hot start. The Rockets used a 10-2 spurt, with four points each from Harden and Westbrook, to make it 99-92 with about four minutes left. Westbrook had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and Rivers added 14 points off the bench. Brooklyn scored 14 straight points over the last minutes of the third quarter and the first minutes of the fourth to cut the lead to 88-86 with about 10 minutes remaining. Houston missed eight straight shots and had two turnovers to allow the Nets to trim the deficit. Harden made one of two free throws with about 9 1/2 minutes left for Houston's first points since there were about two minutes left in the third quarter. The Nets then scored the next four points, with a tip-in layup by DeAndre Jordan, to go on top 90-89 for their first lead since early in the first quarter. The Rockets led by double-digits for most of the game after a 42-point first quarter and were up by 16 late in the third. But the Nets scored the last seven points of the third quarter, capped by a 3-pointer from Rodions Kurucs, to cut the lead to 88-79 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn made 11 of 39 3-pointers. ... Jordan had 12 rebounds and a block. ... Joe Harris scored 12 points. Rockets: C Clint Capela sat out with a bruised heel. Coach Mike D'Antoni said he wasn't sure if he'd be ready to return on Sunday night. ... Isaiah Hartenstein tied a career high with nine points and had 13 rebounds. ... Houston out-rebounded Brooklyn 54-47, despite Capela's absence. GORDON'S RETURN Houston guard Eric Gordon is scheduled to return on Sunday night after sitting out for the last six weeks following arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. D'Antoni said he will be on a minutes restriction and expects him to play no more than 25 minutes in his first game back. Harden is thrilled that the team is getting Gordon back. That's another shooter and another ball handler and a guy that can be aggressive and make plays and it's just something that we were missing, Harden said. Gordon was averaging 10.9 points in nine games this season before he was injured.","401161120"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Clevelands young backcourt showed just enough composure to overcome an otherwise rough night taking care of the ball. Rookie Darius Garland and second-year backcourt partner Collin Sexton each scored 18 points, and the Cavaliers overcame an NBA season tying-high 29 turnovers to hold off the Minnesota Timberwolves 94-88 on Saturday. ""Never, ever, ever, coach John Beilein responded when asked if he could recall winning a game despite committing that many turnovers. I'm trying to put it all together. It's not like we shot the lights out either, but our defense was the difference. Garland scored seven points in the fourth quarter, including five in the game-deciding run. The Wolves had finally brought their home crowd to life with a 9-0 run that allowed them to go up 78-77 with 6:44 left, their first lead since 2-0. But Larry Nance Jr. regained Cleveland's lead on a follow shot and Tristan Thompson hit a pair of free throws to start a 10-2 run. Garland had a 3-pointer and a jumper during the run. Kelan Martin's 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left pulled Minnesota to 90-87, but Sexton hit two foul shots with 14 seconds remaining to put it away. It was an ugly game missing top scorers from both teams. Cleveland led for most the night before needing its quick rally. Showed a lot of resiliency, Thompson said. This team is fighting; we've won four out of the last five games, so something is going in the right direction. A night after scoring 30 in Boston, Cavs veteran forward Kevin Love sat in street clothes while nursing a right hip contusion. Cleveland all but tried to give the game away with a rash of poor ballhandling and passes -- the 29 turnovers tied Sacramento's mark, set Dec. 15 at Golden State. Luckily for Cleveland, though, Minnesota was missing its two best players. The Wolves struggled to get any offensive flow without Karl-Anthony Towns (knee) and Andrew Wiggins (flu-like symptoms). The Cavs also took advantage of Towns absence on the boards, grabbing a season-high 61 rebounds. Tonight, we stayed in the game, but once again it wasnt pretty, Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Its not one of those things where those two guys are out so we completely scrap a system. Jeff Teague scored 18 points and fellow reserve Martin had 17 for Minnesota. Robert Covington added 14. A win is a win, but but this got a little bit ugly and we got to fix some things, Nance said. BLOWN CHANCES The Wolves, who were coming off their first win in 12 games after a double-overtime victory in Sacramento on Thursday, lost their ninth straight home game. They had a season-high 17 steals and scored 27 points off Cleveland's turnovers, but were done in by a horrendous night on the perimeter and the boards. The Cavaliers outrebounded Minnesota 61-39, and the Wolves -- one of the NBA's worst 3-point shooting teams -- hit only 8 of 37 from behind the arc. We didnt knock down a lot of shots. We left a lot of points on the board, finishing at the rim and stuff. The game was there for us to take, but like I said we just didnt execute, Covington said. VETERAN PRESENCE Thompson added 12 points and 15 rebounds for the Cavaliers and served as Clevelands veteran presence on the floor with Love out. A night after playing nearly 30 minutes in Boston, he logged 35 minutes against the Timberwolves and made his presence felt despite shooting only 2 of 9. Thompson went 8 of 10 from the foul line. He was relentless in rebounding offensively, but particularly defensively. Protected the rim  he was the heart and soul of our team in many ways, Beilein said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Nance started in Love's spot. We thought this would be a good day for him to just rest it, let it calm down, Beilein said of Love, who equaled his season high for scoring Friday. ... Garland started despite straining his right ankle on Friday night. Timberwolves: Saunders said Towns, who missed his sixth game, has been ""progressing"" but didn't provide a timetable for his return. I know its not the answer everybody probably wants to hear, but thats what I have, is that hes progressing, Saunders said. ... F Gorgui Dieng was held to five points on 2-of-8 shooting after averaging 15.6 the previous five games.","401161121"
"MILWAUKEE --  Khris Middleton showed he can shoulder a big share of the load when the Milwaukee Bucks are without Giannis Antetokounmpo. Middleton scored 21 points and NBA-leading Milwaukee overcame Antetokounmpo's absence for the second straight night, beating the Orlando Magic 111-100 on Saturday. Antetokounmpo, the NBA MVP last season, also missed the Bucks' victory Friday in Atlanta because of back soreness. ""The ball is in his hands a lot, especially when we're bringing George (Hill) off the bench,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said about Middleton. ""Khris is a quasi-point guard for us out there, putting him where he's making the reads and the decisions. ""To have a guy who is 6-7 and can shoot like that and make passes and reads, that's why he's an all-star."" Middleton also had seven assists and five rebounds to help the Bucks improve to 29-5 overall and 16-2 at home. Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova, starting in place of Antetokounmpo, had 17 points and 14 rebounds. Robin Lopez came off the bench to score a season-high 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting and Hill added 17 points. Starting center Brook Lopez had 10 points. Fournier led Orlando with 23 points. Nikola Vucevic added 21 points and eight rebounds, and Jonathan Isaac had 19 points and nine rebounds and matched the franchise record with eight steals. Ilyasova, normally a valuable member of the Bucks bench corps, has played well in three games as a starter when Antetokounmpo has been sidelined this season. ""He was balling. He was everywhere,"" Middleton said. ""The hustle plays, the rebounds, the shots, the assists. It is just energy. He has great hands; he has a great feel, a great knack for just getting open or finding the ball, some way, somehow. I guess that is why he has been in the league so long."" Antetokounmpo's absence should not be much longer. ""He did some work earlier today and he's making progress,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's very close but not capable of going tonight. Hopefully, he'll return soon."" Ilyasova hit back-to-back 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter to give the Bucks an 89-77 lead. The second one came after teammate Brook Lopez lost the ball. but Vucevic tapped it directly to Ilyasova, who immediately drilled the triple from the wing. Brook Lopez blocked a shot by Vucevic a few minutes later, leading to a layup by Pat Connaughton and a 96-81 Milwaukee lead with 6:15 remaining. The Bucks outscored the Magic 33-26 in the fourth quarter. Orlando edged Philadelphia on Friday night and stayed close to the Bucks for three quarters. ""Our starters did defend,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""It's pretty simple. Just look at the box score. Their bench guys played really well. They had more guys play well than we did."" The Bucks reserves outscored the Magic bench, 51-28. TIP-INS Magic: Starting forward Aaron Gordon left the game in the third quarter with a left Achilles injury.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Gregg Popovich readily admits he hates the 3-point shot, yet the San Antonio Spurs defensive-minded coach acknowledges its a necessary evil in todays game. San Antonio gave Popovich plenty to dislike in its most prolific 3-point outing of the season. DeMar DeRozan had 29 points, LaMarcus Aldridge had 25 points and 12 rebounds and the Spurs hit a season-high 18 3-pointers in beating the Detroit Pistons 136-109 on Saturday night. ""Thats what the league is all about, Popovich said. Opening up the paint so you get penetration and you kick it and everybody shoots 3s. Boring, but thats the game."" San Antonio was 18 for 35 from 3-point range, including a career-high five by Aldridge. The Spurs were a shot shy of tying their season-high for 3-point attempts and shot 57% from the field in securing their largest victory at home. San Antonio was averaging 26 3-point attempts entering Saturdays game, and is trying more long-range shots. It has helped the Spurs win seven of their last 12 games. Its not like me and LaMarcus are (Milwaukees) Kyle Korver and (former Dallas forward) Dirk Nowitzki, DeRozan said. We just try to go out there and make the most of it, make the best out of it and I think we are getting a better feel with that. Andre Drummond had 21 points and 18 rebounds for the short-handed Pistons, who played with an 11-man roster due to injuries and illness. There is nothing you can do about that when a good team like this gets it going, Drummond said. Its hard to stop them, especially a team like San Antonio, who is known for playing really well. If they are hitting on all cylinders from the 3, too, its going to be a long night. San Antonio set a season-high with 42 points in the third quarter, fueled by a 25-9 run beginning four minutes into the second half. The Spurs opened a 93-71 lead, capped by four straight 3-pointers by Bryn Forbes and Derrick White and two from Rudy Gay. I thought we competed hard until that time and then the avalanche hit and the resilience, we didnt bounce back, Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. That was the disappointing thing. Gay finished with 16 points and 2-for-6 shooting on 3s. Forbes finished with 18 points on 3-for-5 shooting on 3s. Aldridge finished 5 for 6 on 3s. It's how the league is going and people like me and (Aldridge) have to just learn how to space the floor and help the team out that way, Gay said. You have to get into the lane, pass the ball to 3-point shooters and keep the defense honest. Thats what weve been trying to do. San Antonio raced to a 10-point lead in the first quarter only to lose that advantage in the second quarter while committing nine turnovers. Drummond had 15 points and 12 rebounds in the first half, helping cut the Spurs lead to 59-54 at the half. Pistons forward Blake Griffin had 12 points and two rebounds in 29 minutes. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroits last victory in San Antonio was Jan. 6, 2015.  Drummond, who was listed as probable with a bruised left calf, played 37 minutes.  The Pistons had five players out with injury or illness.  Shooting guard Luke Kennard missed his third straight game with a sore knee.  Markieff Morris sat out with a sprained left foot after playing nine minutes against Washington on Thursday. Spurs: DeRozan has 20-plus points in 400 career games. The only players with more 20-point outings since DeRozan was drafted in 2009 are LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Carmelo Anthony and Aldridge  Aldridges previous career high for 3-pointers was three against Memphis on Monday.  San Antonios previous high was 40 points in the third quarter against Golden State on Nov. 1. SHOOT MORE, SHINE MORE Aldridge has attempted 13 3-pointers in his past three games, which has pleased Popovich, somewhat. We want him to shoot those, Popovich said. If he shoots 10 a game, thats fine with me. How many did he shoot? After being told Aldridge attempted six, Popovich was asked if that was enough to satisfy him. Hes got to get more selfish, Popovich deadpanned. Shoot that damn thing. Get your name in the paper. PRAISE FOR Z-BO Zach Randolph announced his retirement Saturday morning after 19 seasons in the NBA, primarily spent in the Western Conference with Portland and Memphis. Randolph had numerous battles with the Spurs, especially in the postseason. His most memorable was helping Memphis oust San Antonio in the first round of the 2011 playoffs as the Grizzlies became just the fourth No. 8 seed in league history to beat the top seed. Those battles drew the respect and praise of San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. He was a guy who really had great hands, a great skill to rebound and a great skill to catch and work underneath the bucket, very different from most anybody else, Popovich said. He always brought it. He was aggressive and he competed every night.","401161123"
"Seth Greenberg praises Luka Doncic's ability to see plays before they happen and compares his abilities to Magic Johnson. (1:52) SAN FRANCISCO --  Luka Doncic notched his ninth triple-double of the season and didn't even play the fourth quarter. Doncic had 31 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds in just 30 minutes, and the Dallas Mavericks routed the Golden State Warriors 141-121 on Saturday night. ""I didn't expect they were going to trap me in the half court,"" Doncic said. ""If they trap me, they have to play four-on-three basketball, which is easy. It's not just one player on the court -- we have five -- and if they trap me, I'm glad. We're going to hit those open shots. That's easy basketball for us."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 25 points, Kristaps Porzingis had 18 and Seth Curry added 17 off the bench for the Mavericks, who snapped the Warriors' four-game winning streak. D'Angelo Russell had 30 points and eight 3-pointers in the first half but injured his neck after falling and colliding with Dwight Powell during the third quarter. ""Thank God it wasn't anything too serious,"" Russell said. ""Just a little shoulder contusion. The contact kind of knocked the wind out of me, but I'm good now."" Russell returned for the start of the fourth but the Warriors were down by 19 at that point. He finished with 35 points and six assists. ""I want to talk about Russell,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said, ""because I have never seen a guy score 12 points in two minutes to start the game. Right off the bat, he was on pace for 288 points. The shots he was throwing in were amazing. We kept trying to figure out ways to take him out of rhythm. In the first half, it was virtually impossible. Second half, we got a little more traction."" The Mavericks pulled away when Russell was out, outscoring the Warriors 45-24 in the third quarter. Hardaway made a deep 3 with 6:55 left in the third to give the Mavericks an eight-point lead that would only grow as the game went on. Draymond Green had 10 points and eight assists for Golden State, but he and the Warriors struggled to defend the Mavericks. Dallas shot 52.2% from the floor and made a franchise-record 24 3s. ""I wish we could have made more stops defensively,"" Green said, ""but they're a good offensive team. I think in the third quarter we kind of ran out of gas."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas made 10 3s in the first quarter. . Doncic played his second game in a row since he sat out four consecutive games with a right ankle sprain. ""A recovery day and a half is helpful,"" Carlisle said. ""He has done well through the rehab, and he's doing even a little bit better now."" Warriors: Golden State tied a franchise record with nine 3s in the first quarter. . Eric Paschall (bruised hip) and Omari Spellman (illness) both missed a second consecutive game. . The Warriors recalled Alen Smailagic from Santa Cruz of the G League. He had five points, five rebounds and three fouls in 20 minutes against the Mavericks.

Doncic jumped right to his feet and charged at Chriss until the referees separated them. ""I got pushed,"" Doncic said. ""I'm not going to just back up. But things happen in basketball like that. You have to move on."" The referees charged Chriss with a technical foul. ""It got to be a snippy game,"" Carlisle said. ""We're a young team trying to do exceptional things.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Monty Williams felt it was appropriate that Phoenix's first win in nearly three weeks came down to a last-second miss by Sacramento. After coming close to ending their skid three times earlier, the Suns naturally needed to sweat this one out, too. Devin Booker had 32 points and 10 assists and Phoenix held off a late surge to beat the Kings 112-110 on Saturday night and snap an eight-game losing streak. ""Weve lost a few games that way,"" Williams said. ""Stuff happens in games. Were happy to get a win. Off of a tough game yesterday, the resiliency that we showed today was something to be proud of."" Kelly Oubre Jr. added 20 points and 16 rebounds for the Suns, who had not won since beating Memphis on Dec. 9. Three of the losses were by two points or fewer, including a 113-111 defeat against Denver on Dec. 23. Thats why holding off the Kings felt so satisfying. We did it the right way, too, Oubre said. We got some kick-aheads, sped up the pace, we got to put pressure on their defense early. Everything happens that way when we play together. Ricky Rubio had 21 points and eight assists, and Aron Baynes scored 17 points for Phoenix. Buddy Hield scored 23 points for Sacramento, two days after complaining about his lack of playing time late in games. The Kings have lost six straight. Booker scored 11 points in the fourth quarter and the Suns overcame his missed free throw with 5.9 seconds remaining that would have given them a three-point lead. Sacramento failed to capitalize as Harrison Barnes missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.3 Fighting back from 14 down we really locked in and gave ourselves a chance, Kings coach Luke Walton said. It's tough to come out there with another loss but it's good to see our guys fighting like that. When you do that, eventually, you'll start winning again. Its the ninth time this season that Booker has had 30 points or more. Its also the 72nd of his career, fourth-most in Suns history. As many bodies and hands as he has on him, he still makes shots, Williams said. He just willed us to a victory tonight. The Kings' frustrations boiled over in the second quarter when Richaun Holmes and Walton were called for technical fouls after Holmes was whistled for fouling Oubre. Holmes was upset with the call, and Walton continued the argument as Booker went to the line for a free throw. Phoenix used the four-point swing to pull away and take a 59-49 halftime lead. TIP-INS Suns: Oubre, who sat out much of the first half against Golden State in foul trouble, had nine points in the first quarter and a double-double by halftime.  Phoenix committed 14 turnovers, one night after having a season-high 27 in a loss to Golden State.  Mikal Bridges scored 10 points. Kings: Marvin Bagley III will miss a few games with a mid-foot sprain, according to a statement put out by the team. Bagley wore a walking boot on his left foot when he left Golden 1 Center after getting hurt against Houston on Thursday. Sacramento was also without DeAaron Fox (back spasms). Fox played two minutes against the Rockets before coming out. MEETING OF THE MINDS Williams met with Booker, Oubre and Rubio before the game and allowed the players to let their emotions out. Long story short was we all just have to hold each other accountable more and be willing to be coached, Oubre said. We have to continue to hold everybody to a standard, and thats what we told Coach. We want him to hold us to the same standard that he holds the 15th man. If were not doing the right things, do what you have to do. Take us out.","401161125"
"Damon Jones is concerned about the Lakers lack of playmakers besides Anthony Davis and LeBron James. (1:53) PORTLAND, Ore --  Kyle Kuzmas season may have turned a corner on Saturday night, and the Los Angeles Lakers snapped their season-long four-game losing streak in the process. Kuzma scored 24 points, LeBron James had 21 points and 16 assists, and the Lakers beat the Portland Trail Blazers 128-120. Kuzma highlighted a strong performance by the Lakers' reserves, who provided 72 bench points. Portlands bench scored 39 points. It was the type of night the Lakers have expected for Kuzma all season as he has battled through several injuries and a reduction in minutes. Kuzma scored over 20 points for the second straight game. Yeah, Im just healthy now, Kuzma said of another strong performance. Im confident in my body. I took a little bit of time off, sitting out for five games and really just self-collected what I needed to do and got it done. We want him to be that third scorer for us, consistently get to 18 to 20 points a night and more important you know, its just the efficiency right now that I love, James said of Kuzma, who was nine for 17 from the field. Hes just been very efficient mixing it up with his 3s, his paint touches. You saw it tonight on the break as well, just mixing it up. Anthony Davis added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers. The win also helped the Lakers move on from a disappointing Christmas day loss to their crosstown rival Clippers. We were all pretty upset about the last game, Davis said. We just wanted to make an effort to come in and get back in the win column. We were able to pull this one out. Head coach Frank Vogel, who told his team prior to the game that he wanted his team angry and edgy, picked up a technical in the first quarter. I got an early tech, I wanted our group to feel that, Vogel said after the game It's not fun losing. We're a good team and we we're able to use that to our advantage and take it out on this team. Damian Lillard had a game-high 31 points for Portland, which dropped its third straight. Hassan Whiteside had 19 points and 16 rebounds. The game was a high-scoring affair. Both teams scored over 30 points and shot over 50% from the field in the first quarter as the Lakers built a two-point lead. In the fourth quarter, neither team cracked 30 points. The Lakers continued to extended their lead in the first thanks in large part to the play of Kuzma. Kuzma had 20 points in the first half, a season-high for him in any half this season. He had 11 points in the second quarter as the Lakers carried a 71-64 lead into halftime. Portland opened the second half on a 5-0 run before the Lakers seized control again. James connected with Davis twice on full-court passes that led to Lakers baskets. Foul problems for the Lakers kept the Blazers in it. With seven minutes left in the third quarter, a foul by JaVale McGee put the Lakers in the penalty for the remainder of the period. A 3-pointer by CJ McCollum gave Portland their first lead since the first quarter with 5:13 left in the third. Lillard scored 12 points in the quarter. Davis had nine points in the third quarter and an assist to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope for a 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds left to give the Lakers a 103-95 lead after three. Anytime hes on the floor, any second hes on the floor he makes an impact, James said of Davis stretch to close the third quarter. We expect nothing less. Hes just great. Anthony Tolliver gave the Blazers a nice lift off the bench with a season-high 12 points, including four 3-pointers. Anfernee Simons also had a strong game off the Portland bench with 14 points and six rebounds. Another 3-pointer by Caldwell-Pope pushed the lead to 123-112 with 2:54 left. A dunk by Davis on a lob from James pushed the Lakers to a 127-115 lead with 1:37 left. TIP-INS Lakers: Despite coming into the game listed as questionable, the Los Angeles Lakers got LeBron James back on Saturday. That may help their self-described angry and edgy head coach Frank Vogel. After their Christmas day loss to the Clippers, the Lakers entered Saturday riding a season-worst four-game losing streak. I started the film session telling them Im angry and edgy, Vogel said. Forgive me, thats just how I am. Thats how I was feeling yesterday, thats how everyone was feeling. Following up with our guys that was just the pulse of the group. Were not happy losing that Christmas day game and certainly were not happy losing four in a row. We have a lot of habits that we need to tighten the screws on. Trail Blazers: The Blazers still have one win against teams above .500 this season after losing a close game on Thursday to the Utah Jazz. They came back from 23 points down to get to within one point but were unable to close it out. They made the comeback attempt while Hassan Whiteside was on the bench, in part to the play of their back-up center. I thought Skal (Labissiere) was part of the positive momentum of the quarter. (Carmelo Anthony) and CJ (McCollum) played the whole quarter, (Labissiere) played the whole quarter, I brought (Damian Lillard) in, I think Anfernee (Simons) played the whole quarter, so really it was more about keeping the positive momentum in there and I thought Skal played well. Stotts gave Labissiere the start on Saturday in place of Kent Bazemore. It was the 13th different starting lineup Portland has tried this season. However, Labissieres night was cut short less than three minutes into the game as he left with an apparent bruised left knee. He did not return.","401161126"
"LOS ANGELES --  Jordan Clarkson insists he still is trying to get into a flow after just two games with the Utah Jazz. That suggests impressive performances are ahead. Despite the unfamiliarity, Clarkson scored 19 points as the Utah Jazz beat the Los Angeles Clippers 120-107 on Saturday night. A more familiar sight was the 30 points from Donovan Mitchell. ""These guys are just talking to me, a lot, just giving me pointers on calls and everything so that's helping me come along fast,"" Clarkson said. ""I know it's just basically Day 2 for me, but yeah, it's a good one."" Clarkson, who was acquired in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday, came off the bench to shoot 7 of 13 from the field. The Jazz shot 48.6% from 3-point range to win for the seventh time in eight games. Clarkson was scoring 14.6 points in 20 games for the Cavaliers to start the season, with all 29 of his games off the bench. He is expected to reprise that role with the Jazz, no matter how long it takes guard Mike Conley to return from a hamstring injury. Conley has missed 10 of the last 11 games. Kawhi Leonard scored 20 points and Paul George added 19 for the Clippers, who have traded victories and defeats over the past eight games. They were coming off an impressive victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in a Christmas day showdown. The Jazz scored the last 11 points of the game to seal the victory, holding the Clippers scoreless over the final 3:35. The Clippers made just four field goals in the fourth quarter. George was 6 for 20 from the field and 0 for 3 in the decisive final quarter. ""He is just not making shots,"" Clippers head coach Doc Rivers said of George. ""And we have to do a better job of getting him shots. So the offense has got to run better for him to get shots."" Rivers said Leonard was under the weather but still played Saturday as a flu bug has started to make its way through the locker room. ""It has nothing to do with our performance tonight,"" said Leonard, who admitted to not feeling his best. ""We had a chance to win the game. We missed some open shots. (The effect) is probably just on our energy a little bit."" Utah won despite just 12 points and eight rebounds from Rudy Gobert. The Clippers won the battle inside as Ivica Zubac had 15 points and 12 rebounds, but little else went right for Los Angeles. ""I think the biggest problem (early) was myself and physicality,"" Gobert said. ""I wasn't locked in during the first quarter, especially on defensive rebounds. Ads a team, and especially with myself we just turned it around in the second half."" Bojan Bogdanovic had 17 points for the Jazz, while Joe Ingles added 15. Royce O'Neal had 11 points and all five Utah starters scored in double figures. Lou Williams had 16 points off the bench for the Clippers, while Patrick Beverley added 12. The last time the Clippers won consecutive games was during a four-game winning streak that ended Dec. 13. The Clippers started fast, taking a 32-22 lead after one quarter. The Jazz rallied behind 62.5% shooting from the field in the second quarter and 68.4% in the third. Utah took a 93-92 advantage into the fourth quarter. After missing their first four shots in the fourth quarter, the Jazz trailed 96-93. But, Utah pushed back in front on a dunk by Mitchell that made it 98-97 with 9:18 remaining. The Jazz increased their lead to 109-102 on a layup by Clarkson with 4:55 remaining and held off the Clippers from there. ACTIONS, NOT WORDS Mitchell's 30 points came on a night when he went 13 of 23 from the field and 4 of 9 from 3-point range. He also combined for 60 points in the first two meetings against the Clippers this season, with Rivers saying the sharp shooter looks extremely comfortable against his team that is known for its perimeter defense, especially with Beverley. ""The one thing I learned from my rookie year when playing (Beverley) is you don't say anything,"" Mitchell said of the trash-talking veteran opponent. ""I think it was my third of fourth game in the league and I said something after having a little hot streak and after that I didn't score. Have the appropriate fear and understand they have guys who can lock in on the defensive end."" DEEP SHOTS, NOT THOUGHTS Clippers guard Landry Shamet went 4 for 5 from 3-point range and in the process became the sixth-fastest player to make 200 3-pointers in NBA history. He is now 202 for 483 from distance in two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and Clippers. So does his efficient use of the 3-point line mean anything to the 22-year-old Wichita State product? ""No,"" he said succinctly. TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic was given a technical foul while on the bench as the third quarter was coming to a close. . The Jazz will look to take advantage of an upcoming schedule that has them playing seven consecutive games against teams that are under .500 in a run that goes through Jan. 12. Clippers: Forward Montrezl Harrell was out because of an illness, missing his first game since Nov. 2017. Last season, Harrell was one of 21 players in the NBA to play in all 82 games. . Beverley went to the locker room with a right wrist injury early in the third quarter but returned to the game. After the game, Rivers said he was still trying to find out the severity of the injury.","401161127"

""It feels good but all of it, honestly, wouldn't have meant anything if we didn't win,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""That was the best feeling, knowing that we came out of here with a win."" Nerlens Noel added 13 points and Darius Bazley had 11 to help the Thunder win their fifth straight in Toronto. Oklahoma City has won 11 of 15 overall. ""With a team like us that's fighting night in and night out to stay above .500, it's a great feeling,"" Paul said.

His confidence, his patience, his pace has been great."" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said he's seen Gilgeous-Alexander mature as an offensive threat during his recent run. ""He's finding his areas where he can score,"" Donovan said. ""He's figuring out, inside of our offense, when there's good times to really go attack and be aggressive.""

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  When Memphis guard Dillon Brooks scores 20 points this season, it results in a Grizzlies victory. And with Brooks reaching 20 points Sunday night, the Grizzlies sent the Charlotte Hornets to their fifth straight loss with a 117-104 victory. The Grizzlies are 8-0 when Brooks has at least 20 points. People say it a lot, Brooks said when asked about the undefeated streak behind his scoring. But Im just out there trying to win regardless of if I shoot it well or if Im not shooting it well. Brandon Clarke, one of the NBA leaders in shooting percentage at 65.1%, scored 18 points and converted 7 of 12 shots. Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points, and Jaren Jackson Jr. added 14 points and 12 rebounds for Memphis. Everybodys just playing together, Jackson said about Memphis finishing December with an 8-8 record. Its not a matter of anything clicking more. Shots are falling a lot, and were playing better defensively. Thats the big thing. I think everybody is locked in defensively. Malik Monk led Charlotte with 18 points off the bench and provided a fourth-quarter boost that pulled the Hornets within single digits. Devonte Graham had 16 points and 10 assists but was 5 of 18 from the field, including 3 of 12 from outside the arc. P.J. Washington also scored 16 points for Charlotte. The Hornets struggled early from the field, starting 3 of 16 overall and making only one of their first nine 3-point shots. I think we were just coming down and taking early 3s and taking some early mid-ranges, Washington said. I think we could have done a better job of moving the ball. There were times when Charlotte rallied enough that it seemed headed back into the game. But each time the Hornets made a run, the Grizzlies answered, including the final six minutes after the Hornets pulled to 99-91. Brooks scored the next three baskets in the lane, and Memphis led 105-91. Its just part of the game, Graham said about Charlotte shooting 43% on the night, including 9 of 31 from 3. Youre going to hit some. Youre going to miss some. I felt like we were taking our normal shots. Guys who shoot the ball shoot the ball, getting to paint, missing some bunnies and floaters, things like that. While Brooks led Memphis in scoring, he also was responsible for the defensive assignment on Graham. His goal was to take the Hornets leading scorer out of his comfort zone, forcing him right and crowding him. Just being super aggressive, Brooks said, adding: Pressing up on him. Giving him a little contact, then he couldnt get into his rhythm, couldnt get into his flow. TIP-INS Hornets: Graham started 0 of 4 from 3-point range, then connected on a desperation 41-footer against the shot clock in the second quarter. ... C Cody Zeller scored 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting. ... Graham has three straight games of double-digit assists and has multiple 3-pointers in 13 straight games. Grizzlies: Grayson Allen matched his season-high with 15 points. ... F Jae Crowder sat out with left ankle soreness. Kyle Anderson started in Crowders place, Andersons second start of the season. ... Rookie Ja Morant had six points, his lowest-scoring game of the season. He had seven assists. SLO MO Charlotte coach James Borrego is familiar with Griz forward Kyle Andersons game from their days with the San Antonio Spurs. And Andersons nickname of Slo Mo is well-earned because of his deliberate Euro-step moves. Asked if Andersons game can slow any more, Borrego replied: No. Kyle brings the game to a halt on both sides.","401161129"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Lonzo Ball pulled up decisively from left wing to sink his career-high seventh 3-pointer in a single game, then glided back toward the Pelicans' defensive end, slapping the extended hand of coach Alvin Gentry as a thunderous roar filled the arena. Showing increasing confidence in his modified shooting stroke, Ball scored a season-high 27 points and New Orleans beat the undermanned Houston Rockets 127-112 on Sunday night for their fourth straight victory. ""I knew it was not going to happen overnight. This is a new shot for me,"" said Ball, who had a slow start to the season but made 11 3s combined in a pair of games over the weekend. ""Hopefully it can get consistent over time."" E'Twaun Moore hit five 3s and scored a season-high 25 points in a reserve role for New Orleans, which trailed by nine early in the fourth quarter before suddenly seizing complete control against a Houston squad without its three most productive players: James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Clint Capela. Brandon Ingram scored 27 and Jrue Holiday 25 for the Pelicans, who'll enter the new year having won five of six games as they await the debut of No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson. Derek Favors had 12 points and 17 rebounds. Daniel House Jr. scored 22 and Eric Gordon, returning for the first time since having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in mid-November, added 20 points. ""I just want to continue to build from this,"" Gordon said. ""We played well tonight. It's just things got tough towards the end and we kind of fell. We've got a lot of young guys playing out there, but everybody played well and I'm sure we'll be fine."" Isaiah Hartenstein, making his first-career start, had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Rockets, who shot 51.9% (42 of 81), made 15 3s and spent much of the opening three quarters in the lead. ""I've just got to make the most of my opportunities,"" Hartenstein said. ""I think I did a pretty good job."" Houston led 95-86 after Gordon's driving finger roll to open the fourth quarter, but the Pelicans suddenly took over with an 18-1 run fueled by Moore, who drained four 3s and a jumper in the span of 3:04. ""Big games like that coming off the bench are huge and kind of makes you a complete team; E'Twaun came off and picked us up,"" said Holiday, whose 12 fourth-quarter points were second only to Moore's 14. When Moore finally missed a 3 off the front rim, Holiday came flying down the lane to slam it home with two hands. Ball, who also had nine rebounds and eight assists, capped the run with a steal from Austin Rivers that he converted into a transition layup to make it 104-96. Harden, who'd been listed as questionable with a sprained toe after scoring 44 in a victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night, was scratched from the lineup for the first time this season. The Rockets still started fast offensively as Gordon hit a 3 for the game's first points and hit another to give the Rockets a 37-36 lead at the end of the first quarter. Ball's fifth 3 of the game tying it at 64, seconds before the half ended. Ingram, who came to New Orleans with Ball and Josh Hart from Los Angeles in a trade this summer that sent Anthony Davis to the Lakers, said it's been ""exciting to see the work pay off"" for Ball, who not only changed his shot but also had to rebuild strength in his legs after missing the end of last season because of ankle trouble. ""This is confidence for him to keep shooting the basketball, keep distributing for everybody and just be him,"" Ingram said. TIP-INS Rockets: Chris Clemons had 16 points and 10 assists but missed seven of 11 3-point shots. ... Ben McLemore finished with 12 points. ... Center Tyson Chandler was active but coach Mike D'Antoni elected not to play him. ... Houston used just eight players in the game. Pelicans: Shot 49% (50 of 102) and finished 18 of 44 from 3-point range, making 10 of their last 19. ... New Orleans outrebounded Houston 47-41 and turned 17 Houston turnovers into 23 points while committing just nine turnovers. ... The Pelicans still have yet to estimate when Williamson will return from arthroscopic knee surgery performed the day before the regular season began, but he has been increasingly active in warm-ups and practices, running through 5-on-0 drills and putting up shots. LOPSIDED PERIOD The Pelicans wound up outscoring the Rockets 41-19 in the fourth quarter and Moore said it started with New Orleans putting forth more effort on defense, particularly around the 3-point line. ""That's what they do is shoot 3s,"" Moore said. ""They weren't going to stop missing. We had to make them miss.""","401161130"
"DENVER --  Michael Porter Jr. found out just before the opening tip he was getting his first career start. The rookie wasted little time making an impact. Porter scored a career-high 19 points while filling in for injured Gary Harris to help the Denver Nuggets hold off the skidding Sacramento Kings 120-115 on Sunday night. Will Barton also scored 19 points, including two free throws with eight seconds left on another night when Denver nearly lost a big lead in the fourth quarter. ""We got the stops we needed and got to the free throw line,"" Jamal Murray said. Porter sat out last season recovering from back surgery after being taken 14th overall in the draft, and he has been in and out of the rotation this year. He immediately took advantage of his opportunity Sunday, scoring six points in the first quarter, and nearly had his previous season high of 15 by halftime. ""I was just wanting to blend with that starting group and do what I could on the court,"" Porter said. ""I feel less nervous starting just because you go straight from warming up into the game instead of sitting down and watching. It felt pretty natural."" The Nuggets have won nine of 10 and finished their three-game homestand with two wins, coming back after a disappointing loss to New Orleans on Christmas. Nikola Jokic had a triple-double in the win over Memphis on Saturday night but was quieter against the Kings with 17 points and eight rebounds. He sat for most of the first half with three fouls and finished with five points. De'Aaron Fox returned to the Kings lineup with 18 points and 13 assists. Nemenja Bjelica scored 27 but couldn't prevent Sacramento from losing its seventh in a row. ""We weren't guarding people from the beginning of the game,"" Buddy Hield said. ""We didn't keep the man we were guarding in front of us. This is the way we've played the past seven games."" Denver gave up 42 fourth-quarter points to the Grizzlies and nearly gave away the game against the Kings. The Nuggets led by 14 midway through the final period but Sacramento hit four 3-pointers, two by Bjelica and one by Hield, who finished with 20 points and eight assists, to make it a three-point game. Denver sank six free throws down the stretch and held on. The Nuggets were 28 of 31 from the line, outscoring Sacramento by 16 on free throws. ""You give up 31 free throws to a playoff team, on their home court on a back end of a back-to-back, it's going to be a hard game to win,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. Jerami Grant scored 18 points and Mason Plumlee, a 54% free throw shooter, was 9 of 10 from the foul line to finish with 15. TIP-INS Kings: Fox (lower back spasms) missed the loss to Phoenix on Saturday night and played just two minutes against Minnesota on Thursday. ""I felt all right. I felt obligated to go out and do what I need to do. It doesn't matter that I was in pain,"" Fox said. ... Marvin Bagley III was out for the second consecutive game with a sprained left foot. Nuggets: Porter last started a game on Nov. 10, 2017, when he was playing for the University of Missouri. ... Harris missed his first game of the season with a bruised shin. ... Paul Millsap missed his second straight game with a bruised left knee. BIRD MAN Jokic gets praise for his passing and shooting but he showed off some Larry Bird-like ballhandling skills in the third quarter when he dribbled behind his back twice to shake two different defenders and score on a layup. ""He can do everything,"" Murray said.","401161131"
"LOS ANGELES --  On the night before his 35th birthday, LeBron James reached another milestone. James became the ninth player in NBA history with 9,000 assists during the Los Angeles Lakers' 108-95 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. James -- named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade earlier in the day -- got No. 9,000 with 4:35 remaining in the first quarter when he fired an outlet pass to Anthony Davis three-quarters of the way down the court for a dunk. It was one of 13 assists on the night for King James. ""It was something that was instilled in me when I first picked up a basketball,"" James said about his ability to distribute the ball. ""One of my earliest coaches said the best part of the game was to move side to side, attract the defense and get the teammate the open look."" James, who scored 13 points, has been more aggressive running the point the past two games. He totaled 29 assists and only three turnovers in victories over Portland and Dallas. ""His pace the last two nights has been outstanding, and not wanting to settle,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have done a much better job of living in the paint the past couple games, making great decisions and being aggressive."" James concurred that he's been more aggressive because he wants to get up the floor quicker to have more time to see what opposing defenses are doing. ""My teammates and coaching staff trust me to play the point and run the show,"" he said. ""It's my job to take care of the ball, put guys in position to be successful, get them the ball on time and on target."" Davis led the Lakers with 23 points and nine rebounds. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added a season-high 19 points, including four 3-pointers, and Dwight Howard scored 15. All of Howard's points came in the second quarter. The Lakers'defense was also impressive as they held the Mavericks to a season low in points and shooting from the floor at 36%. Vogel said he threw in some zone defenses for the first time in the regular season. ""I think it was good and messed them up a little bit. It disrupted them a little bit,"" Davis said. Luka Doncic led Dallas with 19 points but struggled from the field one night after getting his ninth triple-double of the season. The second-year guard shot 5 of 14 and missed all six of his 3-point attempts. ""That was one of the worst games we played. We didn't play like us and had a really bad night. I can't say much more,"" Doncic said. Delon Wright came off the bench to score 14 points. Dorian Finney-Smith and J.J. Barea had 12 apiece. Los Angeles, which has won two straight after a four-game losing streak, led most of the way. The Lakers were up 35-31 midway through the second quarter before going on a 12-2 run to take control. The Mavericks committed four turnovers during a spurt that led to seven Lakers points, including a pair of dunks by Howard. The Lakers' largest lead was 17 midway through the third. ""They played with more force. Any time we started to get some traction they had an answer,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. SURPRISE MEETING Doncic got to shake hands with Lakers great Kobe Bryant courtside after the game and said he was surprised. ""He was talking Slovenian. He was talking my language. I saw Kobe talking Slovenian and I was really surprised,"" Doncic said. TIME TO REFLECT James said he would have a small birthday party Monday but did acknowledge that turning 35 was special. ""I don't have wishes. Biggest one I had was when I turned 21. This one will be mild. When I turn 40, that will be epic,"" he said. TIP-INS Mavericks: G Tim Hardaway Jr. tweaked his hamstring during the first quarter and did not return. Carlisle said after the game the team was optimistic it was nothing serious and Hardaway is day-to-day. ... Dwight Powell had 11 rebounds, marking his second game this season with double digit boards. ... Kristaps Porzingis scored 11 points. Lakers: It was the 25th time in Howard's 15-year career that he scored 15 or more in a quarter. The last time was March 21, 2018, for Charlotte against Brooklyn when he put up 19. ... Los Angeles is 4-0 during road/home back-to-back games. ... JaVale McGee had 11 points and Danny Green added 10.","401161132"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Atlanta Hawks have been the worst team in the NBA this season -- except against the Orlando Magic. Brandon Goodwin scored 21 points, Kevin Huerter added 19, and the Hawks beat the Magic 101-93 Monday night to end a 10-game skid. Playing without injured guard Trae Young for the second straight game, the Hawks trailed by 18 during the first half but rallied back in the third quarter. Alex Len scored eight of his 18 points to fuel a 15-4 run, while Atlanta's defense only yielded six field goals in the quarter. Len's drive and dunk just before the horn gave the visitors a 74-72 lead. ""It felt like I was getting fouled on every play and got no calls, but that's the way it goes in this league,"" Len said. ""Maybe I earned some (respect) by playing more aggressively. We don't get respect, but you've got to earn it, and a couple of wins like this will do that."" Atlanta improved to 7-27 by snapping its second 10-game losing streak of the season. This one ended with the Hawks' second win in two tries against Orlando. Young twisted his ankle in a loss to Milwaukee on Friday. He scored 39 points in a 103-99 win over Orlando in the first meeting between the teams Oct. 26. Atlanta pulled away Monday near the midpoint of the fourth quarter when Huerter scored nine points during an 11-0 run. The Magic trailed 90-78 but trimmed the deficit to five in the final minutes before John Collins' emphatic transition dunk all but ended the comeback bid. ""I thought the guys were spirited tonight,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""They executed, and the execution came from communication with each other."" Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 27 points. Evan Fournier added 22 points, and D.J. Augustin finished with 17 and six assists. Orlando struggled to find any offense down the stretch, scoring only 36 second-half points after scoring 36 in the second quarter alone. ""We scored at times, but I feel like maybe for the first time this year, we didn't play ball as a team offensively from the get-go, and it just caught up to us,"" Fournier said. TIP-INS Hawks: Wins have been scarce for Atlanta, but the road has been somewhat more favorable. Three of the Hawks' last four wins have come away from home. They have won only one home game since beating San Antonio on Nov. 5. Magic: Orlando held an 11-3 record against sub-.500 teams before the loss. ... C Mo Bamba returned after missing the prior two games due to soreness in his right foot. Bamba finished with three points and three rebounds. ... F Wes Iwundu started in place of the injured Aaron Gordon, who was out due to soreness in his left Achilles' tendon. Iwundu had four points and two rebounds in 25 minutes. CARTER HONORED The Magic gave 42-year-old Vince Carter a video tribute during the first quarter. Carter, who grew up in nearby Daytona Beach, stepped out of a team huddle to acknowledge an ovation after the video. Carter played 97 games for the Magic in 2009-10, averaging 16.3 points. He had four points in 21 minutes Monday. ""I still live here, and people in the community still come up and say, `Hey, we miss you here,"" Carter said. ""We had a good time here.""","401161133"
"WASHINGTON --  Garrison Mathews couldn't believe what he was hearing. With the Washington Wizards holding an insurmountable lead, the home crowd began chanting MVP! MVP! Mathews, an undrafted guard from tiny Lipscomb University, scored 28 points in his 11th NBA game to help the depleted Wizards beat the Miami Heat 123-105 on Monday night. Still, he doubted the fans were yelling for him. I thought they were saying, Go Heat,' Mathews said. Mathews played big minutes because the Wizards were missing leading scorer Bradley Beal. Jordan McRae and Ian Mahinmi, also filling in for key members of the rotation, had big games for Washington as well. McRae scored a season-high 29 points and Mahinmi had a career-best 25. McRae, a third-year player, and Mahinmi, a 13-year veteran, enjoyed nights to remember against Miami (24-9), which had its five-game winning streak snapped. The Heat entered with the second-best record in the East and lost for just the third time in 20 games against conference opponents. ""We were a step behind and playing on our heels,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We end up fouling or just getting beat off the dribble too many times. Jimmy Butler led the Heat with 27 points and Duncan Robinson scored 16. Bam Adebayo had 14 points and 14 rebounds. It shows how tough this league can be night to night,"" Spoelstra said. ""Anything you do before doesnt guarantee whats going to happen in the future. Mathews, whose previous NBA high was six points, scored 20 in the second quarter. Mahinmi had 19 in the first half as Washington (10-22) took a 71-63 lead at the break and won going away. Mahinmi shot 10 for 11 from the field. We were completely destroyed at both ends, Miami guard Goran Dragic said. ""Our offense was not there. Our defense was not even slightly there. It was tough. TIP-INS Heat: Allowed a season-high 42 points in the second quarter. ... End the decade with a 488-319 record (.605), best in the Eastern Conference. ... Lost for the first time after five wins against Southeast Division opponents. ... Lost for the first time in 22 games when outrebounding their opponents. Wizards: Beal sat out for the second consecutive game with soreness in his lower right leg. Getting better, coach Scott Brooks said. Anticipate him practicing (Tuesday), and we'll see how he feels. Brooks hopes Beal can return for Wednesday's game against Orlando. ... C Thomas Bryant missed his 14th straight game with a stress reaction in his right foot. Brooks said Bryant could be back next week. He'll practice with the G-League Capital City Go-Go in the next few days. BENCH RULES McRae, Mathews and Ish Smith, who had 19 points, combined for 76 of Washington's 80 points from its bench. Miami got just 27 points from its subs, with Dragic accounting for 10. It was a trap game,"" Dragic said. ""If you want to be the best team in the East, we need to know that. That every night you need to bring it and we didnt do that tonight. Its a good lesson for this group. MAHINMI STARS For most of his 13-season NBA career, Mahimni has been a backup. In two of his three previous seasons with the Wizards, he's been limited by injuries and this season, he's missed 20 of the first 21 games. He's a glue guy that can protect the paint and can give you some good minutes when he's healthy,"" Brooks said. Mahinmi isn't used to being in the spotlight. Obviously, we're missing a lot of key guys, he said. I just wanted to come out a little bit more aggressive.","401161134"
"CHICAGO --  With an NBA-best 30-5 record, the Milwaukee Bucks are off to a great start. Giannis Antetokounmpo, though, is more concerned with the team's finish this season. The reigning MVP had 23 points and 10 rebounds after missing two games with a sore back, and Milwaukee pulled away in the second half for a 123-102 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday night. Antetokounmpo, the league's second-leading scorer with an average of 30.5 points per game entering this one, played only 27 minutes and sat out the final 5 1/2 because of the lopsided score. He was 8 for 14 from the field with six assists. ""We won 30 games before January; It's cool, but we can always do better,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We've got to keep improving because the goal is to play late in the season."" Khris Middleton scored 25 points for the Bucks, and Eric Bledsoe had 15 points in 16 minutes after missing the previous eight games with a fractured right leg. ""We move way faster with him,"" Antetokounmpo said of Bledsoe. ""He's like a sports car. He goes so fast, and we've got to follow him. It's always good to have him back."" Zach LaVine scored 19 points for Chicago but shot just 7 for 23 from the field. Lauri Markkanen and Coby White had 18 points apiece and Wendell Carter Jr. added 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls. ""In the first half, I think we were there, but I think in the second half, we weren't playing our best basketball,"" Markkanen said. ""We've shown we can play with anybody, but obviously we've got to do it for 48 minutes to actually win the game. ""We can't have those lapses we did in the third. We're capable of getting those wins."" Milwaukee jumped out to an 8-0 lead as Chicago missed its first six shots. The Bucks led 31-20 at the end of the first quarter and stretched it to 33-20 early in the second on a basket by Robin Lopez. But the Bulls -- after shooting 9 of 29 in the first -- suddenly got hot from behind the 3-point arc. White and Markkanen each had three 3-pointers in the second to trim the Milwaukee advantage. Chicago was 8 for 14 on 3s in the quarter. With just under two minutes left in the first half, White hit a driving scoop off the glass to give the Bulls a 52-51 lead, their first of the game. Antetokounmpo quickly answered with a putback on the other end to put the Bucks back on top. Milwaukee led 55-52 at halftime thanks in part to a 15-0 advantage in free throw attempts (making 12). Any chance of a Chicago upset was quickly dashed in the third. The Bucks opened with a 17-4 run for a 72-56 lead -- with Antetokounmpo capping the spurt with a thunderous dunk that drew a loud roar from the United Center crowd. ""There's momentum plays, there's things that just give your team energy and may be deflating for your opponent,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It was great. For him to miss a couple of games and come back and have a dunk like that was impressive."" Milwaukee led 95-77 after three quarters. Kyle Korver hit a 3-pointer 2 1/2 minutes into the fourth for a 105-81 advantage, the Bucks' biggest of the game. TIP-INS Bucks: G Wesley Matthews sat out with a bruised right thigh. ""He's been playing through it and I think it's at a stage where him not playing is the right move,"" Budenholzer said. ""Hopefully, it's just a short-term thing."" Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison missed his 15th straight game with a right shoulder injury. Hutchison has been cleared for contact and is expected to practice with the team on Tuesday. ""He'll have full contact,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""I'll get a chance to watch him play a little bit. We'll just keep working at it."" DUNK OF THE NIGHT Antetokounmpo's dunk in the third might have been the knockout punch, but it wasn't voted dunk of the game in the Bucks locker room. Reserve guard Pat Connaughton took the honors with a flying putback late in the third. ""It was for sure Pat,"" Bledsoe said. ""Giannis, I mean it's unreal, but we see it. Pat, man, he just comes from out of nowhere and brings the house down.""","401161135"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Down two stars, down on the scoreboard and down on their luck, the Minnesota Timberwolves found a way. Shabazz Napier scored a season-high 24 points, Jarrett Culver added a career-high 21 and the short-handed Timberwolves rallied past the Brooklyn Nets 122-115 in overtime Monday night. ""It was a good win,"" Minnesota's Gorgui Dieng said. ""How we played with that energy. We didn't quit when we was down, and we come out with a victory."" The Timberwolves had lost 12 of 13 and were again without injured Karl-Anthony Towns and ill Andrew Wiggins. In their absence, Dieng had 11 points and 20 rebounds, while rookies Culver and Naz Reid had career highs in points and rebounds. Culver played 39 minutes, while Reid scored 13 points in 20 minutes. Keita Bates-Diop added 15 points off the bench. ""That was a heart game,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""They knew there were going to be opportunities tonight, and guys took advantage of it. I think there were a number of things that you can point to that have to make you feel good."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 36 points to lead the Nets, who have lost three straight. Joe Harris scored 19 points. Dinwiddie has scored at least 20 points in 18 of the 21 games he's started in place of injured Kyrie Irving. ""We didn't defend well enough,"" Dinwiddie said. ""We could have made plays here to win in regulation, but did our job defensively since they only had 103 points. Them scoring basically 20 points in the OT, it's only a five-minute stretch. That's not near good enough."" The Wolves led only once in the first three quarters. A 7-0 run in the closing minutes was capped by Dieng's 3-pointer from the corner that gave them the lead at 103-101 with 36.3 seconds remaining in regulation. Taurean Prince's basket tied it at 103-103 with 26.9 seconds left and set up the overtime finish. Robert Covington and Kelan Martin hit key 3-pointers in overtime for the Timberwolves. Covington's 3 with 3:15 to play gave them the lead for good. Napier scored eight points in overtime. ""It was just an unacceptable performance by us,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We were lucky to get to overtime, quite honestly. Even at halftime, I felt like we were just not playing at a high level. We're not playing up to Nets standards. Hard to figure out why. I didn't think it was an overtime game. I thought they outplayed us."" Minnesota won at home for the first time since Nov. 13, snapping a nine-game skid in Minneapolis. TIP-INS Nets: Irving (right shoulder impingement) missed his 21st straight game. Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) was out for the 22nd consecutive game. The Nets also were without Nicolas Claxton (left hamstring soreness) and David Nwaba (right Achilles tendon tear). Timberwolves: Towns (left knee sprain) missed his seventh consecutive game. Wiggins (flu-like symptoms) missed his second. Treveon Graham also missed the game with illness. Jake Layman (left toe sprain) was out for the 18th game in a row. Noah Vonleah (left gluteal contusion) was a late scratch. NO TIME TO PREPARE Reid, who has spent most of this season with Iowa of the G League, said he found out around 3 p.m. he was needed in Minnesota that night. He got the first flight he could out of Des Moines and arrived shortly before the game. In his third career NBA game, he played a career-high 20 minutes. ""The biggest thing was just stay ready,"" Reid said. ""So that's what I did.""","401161136"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Amid early offensive struggles, the Utah Jazz never wavered on defense. The surging Jazz pulled away for a 104-81 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night by leaning on their trademark rugged defense. Utah ran the Pistons off the 3-point line, holding Detroit to 4-of-14 shooting from the perimeter. The Jazz also forced 17 turnovers and scored 25 points off those miscues. In the end, Detroit managed a season low in points. Getting stops revived a sluggish Utah offense. The Jazz shot just 33.3% from the floor in the first half, but connected on 59% of their field goal attempts after halftime. They made 26 baskets over the final two quarters after totaling just 13 through the first 24 minutes. ""The biggest thing in the first half was just the offense getting stagnant,"" guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""We did what we wanted on defense."" Mitchell scored 23 points and Jordan Clarkson added 20 to lead the Jazz. Rudy Gobert added 13 points and 19 rebounds, and Bojan Bogdanovic scored 17 as Utah won for the eighth time in nine games. Derrick Rose had 20 points to lead the Pistons, and Andre Drummond added 15 points and 13 rebounds. Detroit has dropped seven straight against Utah. ""It's the tale of two halves and until we grow up and understand that, that's our cross to bear,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Utah never found much of an offensive rhythm in the first half. The Jazz did not score their first basket until five minutes into the game. Detroit did not fare much better, shooting 38% in the half. That opened the door for Utah to keep things close. The Pistons carved out a 38-31 lead late in the second quarter when Tim Frazier capped a 9-2 run with a driving layup. Detroit never trailed during the period, but could not pull away. Utah closed the gap in the final two minutes, cutting the deficit to 40-39 going into halftime when Mitchell and Gobert each scored on a dunk and Mitchell added a pair of free throws. The Jazz really got rolling on offense in the third quarter. Utah opened the second half with a 16-2 run to take a 55-42 lead midway through the period. Mitchell sparked the surge with back-to-back baskets, and Joe Ingles punctuated it with consecutive buckets as well. ""In the first half, we just came out with a lot of energy,"" Drummond said. ""We just lost our groove coming out of halftime. That's a good team so they broke it down, they watched what we're doing and found ways to exploit what we were doing and they got themselves going."" Detroit cut the deficit to 70-63 early in the fourth on a driving floater from Rose. The Jazz pulled away for good behind a 20-6 run. Bogdanovic fueled the spurt with three baskets. Mitchell capped it with a step-back jumper that gave Utah a 90-69 lead with 5:17 remaining. ""We were getting stops,"" Clarkson said. ""We got some buckets in transition. It made the game easier for us."" FEELING AT HOME Clarkson has rejuvenated the Jazz bench in a short time since Utah acquired him in a trade with Cleveland last Tuesday. Clarkson is averaging 16 points on 47% shooting through his first three games with the Jazz. He kept the offense afloat Monday with timely baskets in each quarter and became the first Utah reserve to score 20 points in a game this season. ""That's one of the things we know he's capable of doing,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""I think he picked his spots and guys did a good job of finding him."" Clarkson has been a quick study on the complex terminology and sets the Jazz use on offense. He credited teammates like Mitchell and Ingles with talking to him and helping him know where to go on the court. ""I'm coming in and just trying to listen and grow every day,"" Clarkson said. NO URGENCY Casey criticized his team after the game for lacking a sense of urgency coming out of halftime. Detroit committed seven turnovers and made just one basket over the first six minutes of the third quarter. ""I guess I need to throw coolers and throw chairs and stuff at halftime to get professionals to come out ready to play,"" Casey said. ""Maybe stand on my head."" TIP-INS Pistons: Blake Griffin (left knee soreness) and Markieff Morris (left foot sprain) did not play. . Detroit was outscored 36-35 in bench points. The Pistons came into the game ranked second in bench scoring with 47.5 points per game. Jazz: Gobert is averaging 16.2 rebounds over his last 10 games. .

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  In the first half, the Phoenix Suns trailed by 19 points. By the final seconds, Kelly Oubre Jr. was blowing goodbye kisses to the Portland Trail Blazers and their fans.

After the shot, he blew kisses to the crowd while jogging around the court as Portland called a timeout. ""I think I feel like the first two I blew `em some kisses, they booed me.

Ricky Rubio added 18 points and 13 assists for the Suns, who won their second consecutive game and handed Portland its fourth straight defeat. ""Terrible loss,"" Blazers guard CJ McCollum said. Phoenix coach Monty Williams liked the fight his team showed in sticking to its plan. ""If you're a boxer, you box your way,"" Williams said. ""You don't switch up and go southpaw in the middle of the fight. You have to fight your style and I think that's how we have to be. We have to play our style of basketball, make adjustments as we go along. I thought we started the game in a bit of a laze."" Williams also was proud of the effort from Deandre Ayton, who had 12 points in 20 minutes off the bench in just his third game of the season. ""I thought he gave us juice,"" Williams said. ""Guys had confidence in him to not only plug the middle, but just having that size and athleticism. We haven't had a hand above the rim in a long time."" Damian Lillard scored 33 points and McCollum added 25 for Portland. Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 22 rebounds. ""It hurt from the standpoint that we were winning the game, we came out extremely well,"" Carmelo Anthony said after shooting 4 for 16. ""This is one of those games that we let slip away from us."" Lillard hit his first five 3s and scored 16 points in the opening period. Portland led by 19 multiple times, but Phoenix went on an 8-0 run to close the first half down 64-55. The Blazers were up 89-83 after three. Oubre's 3-pointer cut Portland's advantage to 108-107 with 3:31 left, and a tip-in by Ayton with 2:48 remaining gave Phoenix its first lead since the opening quarter. Booker's jumper put Phoenix up 115-110. TIP-INS Suns: Ayton missed the previous five games with an ankle injury. He got hurt after serving a 25-game suspension. Following consecutive workouts, the Suns decided to let the former No. 1 pick loose. ""It's just part of our season so far. We're just thankful to have him back. He's progressed well in his treatment and workouts on the floor,"" Williams said. ""He's been working his butt off in simulations of games. He felt really good yesterday and this morning and after shootaround. So we just thought it best to get him out there. We'll watch his minutes, obviously."" Aron Baynes remained the starting center as Ayton came off the bench. Trail Blazers: Second-year wing Gary Trent Jr. scored all 11 of his points in the first half, including three 3-pointers. Anfernee Simons also gave Portland a boost off the bench with 12 points. ... The Blazers sustained yet another injury to their frontcourt when Skal Labissiere injured his right knee against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday. Results of an MRI on Labissiere were inconclusive, but the Blazers have ruled him out for their upcoming five-game road trip. The Blazers called up two-way player Moses Brown from the G-League. Portland coach Terry Stotts expects 3-point specialist Anthony Tolliver to play more at center as the team is already without starting center Jusuf Nurkic and starting power forward Zach Collins. ""I think we kind of have to rethink some things because of what he can do on both ends,"" Stotts said of Tolliver.","401161138"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  There were no video tributes for Kemba Walker on this visit. The Boston Celtics guard returned to Charlotte for a second time without quite the same buzz, and that was OK with him. ""A little less emotional,"" he said. ""But it was fun."" And productive. Walker had 22 points, Jayson Tatum had 24 and Gordon Hayward added 21 as Boston beat the Hornets 109-92 Tuesday. The Celtics have won six of seven and improved to 23-8. Walker, the Hornets franchise leader in scoring, was making his second appearance in Charlotte since he was sent to Boston in a sign-and-trade deal last July. After tearing up during a pregame tribute in his first visit Nov. 7, Walker kept cool this time, adding four rebounds and seven assists. ""It's just always fun to see my old friends, my old teammates, the people that work around the building that take care of this place, just a lot of old faces,"" he said. ""It was fun."" Boston coach Brad Stevens thinks Walker will draw cheers from Charlotte fans for the rest of his career. ""I think people are going to react like that forever -- whether it's here or in Storrs,"" Stevens said of Walker, who was a first-round pick for Charlotte after leading Connecticut to the 2011 NCAA title. ""Wherever he goes, he's a special guy and he's an awfully good player. And he plays both sides of the ball and he's been really good for us."" Enes Kanter had 13 points, 13 rebounds and a career-high six blocked shots for Boston. The victory completed a 3-0 season sweep for the Celtics over the Hornets. Tatum hit five straight shots in the first quarter -- including a trio of 3-pointers -- and the Celtics overcame an early five-point deficit to lead 24-18 after the first quarter. Hayward scored 10 points in the second quarter as Boston stretched the lead to 14 before taking a 50-43 edge into halftime. Charlotte surged within four points late in the third quarter before the Celtics responded with a 16-6 spurt to make it 89-75 with 9:55 left. They led by at least 10 the rest of the way. ""Offensively we've really struggled to score against them,"" said Charlotte coach James Borrego. ""Their length, their size, their switching ability is tough on us over a 48-minute game."" PJ Washington led Charlotte with 15 points, and Miles Bridges had 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Hornets have lost six straight. ""We've got a game in two nights so we've just got to stick to it and just try to go and get another one,"" Washington said. ""There's a lot of great teams in this league and we feel like we can be one of those so, just coming out and keep the same energy we had tonight in the next game."" TIP-INS Celtics: One day after being named Eastern Conference player of the week, Jaylen Brown sat out with a sinus infection. Stevens said Brown is day-to-day. Brown averaged 27.0 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.3 assists while shooting 62.2% from the field and 57.9% on 3-pointers in three games last week. Hornets: Charlotte is on its longest losing streak since dropping six straight from Nov. 3-17 during the 2017-18 season. GRAHAM SUPPORT Walker says he's been in regular contact with second-year Hornets guard Devonte' Graham, who leads Charlotte with 19.1 points per game. ""He's doing a great job and he's showing the whole NBA how good of a player he is, and that kind of attention is going to come,"" Walker said. ""I talk to him all the time. I talk to him all the time -- not much advice -- just keep going. Like I said, I'm just super happy for him. I talk to all these guys all the time. I watch every game whenever I get the opportunity to, so there's not much I can say. I'm just letting him go through the process and he's only going to get better.""","401161139"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Domantas Sabonis wasn't taking any chances despite Indiana's big lead before halftime. Sabonis scored 11 of his 23 points in the third quarter and finished with 10 rebounds and five assists to push the Pacers over the Philadelphia 76ers 115-97 Tuesday. ""We know in this league it doesn't matter how many points you're up,"" Sabonis said. ""Teams come back and win."" The 76ers couldn't overcome a 36-point deficit, especially without injured center Joel Embiid. The two-time All-Star, who leads the team 23.7 points and 12.4 rebounds per game, was out with a sore left knee. T.J. Warren had 21 points and Myles Turner added 14 for the Pacers, who ended a three-game losing streak in the series and improved to 22-12 overall. Josh Richardson had 20 points and Ben Simmons had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, who have lost three straight with a game remaining in a four-game trip. Philadelphia dropped to 23-13, including losses in six of the last nine games. ""I think, in general, after coming out of Miami (a 117-116 loss in overtime) and losing two games prior to being here, that's a disappointing performance,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""I do give Indiana credit as it relates to us missing shots. We certainly had people down. They were some of our better players. Just didn't have the performances that they're used to having and sometimes that happens."" The Pacers used a big second quarter to put the game away, outscoring Philadelphia 38-16 in the period to take a 67-43 halftime lead. Indiana guard Malcolm Brogdon returned to the starting lineup for the first time after missing the last three games with a sore left hamstring. He went to the bench in the first half with a sore lower back and didn't return. The Pacers evened the regular season series after losing 119-116 at Philadelphia on Nov. 30. They went on a 15-2 run to start the second quarter and took a 46-29 lead with Warren's layup with 6:24 to go. Indiana went ahead by 26 points at one point. Doug McDermott scored to put the Pacers ahead 65-39 with 1:02 remaining in the quarter. The two teams meet again in two weeks at Indianapolis with the final game in the four-game regular season series March 14 at Philadelphia. ""We played great basketball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We established our defense, got stops and were able to get into transition. With 35 assists we were making their defense move and work. I just loved the tempo we established at the defensive end of the floor as well as the offensive end."" Indiana led by 36 -- it's largest lead of the game -- after another big run that came in the third quarter. Sabonis made a 3-pointer and two other baskets in a 14-2 spurt. He capped off the string with a layup on an alley-oop pass from Jeremy Lamb to make it 87-51 with 6:29 remaining in the third. TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia shot just 20% (5 of 20) from the field in the second quarter after shooting 52.4% in the first quarter. ... Richardson also finished with five assists. ... G Matisse Thybulle was out with a right knee sprain. Pacers: Reserve T.J. McConnell had 11 points and 10 assists. ... Lamb had 13 points and six assists. ... Turner was 3 for 5 on 3-pointers. WINNING AT HOME The Pacers won after dropping the last two meetings with the 76ers in Indianapolis. Overall, Indiana is on a season-best six-game winning streak at home and are 15-3 in home games this season.","401161140"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it  and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points. That, as Leonard pointed out afterward, bodes well for a franchise in serious pursuit of its first NBA championship. George had 21 points with season highs of 11 rebounds and nine assists to shake off a slow start, and short-handed Los Angeles thumped the Sacramento Kings 105-87 on Tuesday. Leonard scored 14 of his 24 points in the third quarter to help the Clippers to their 14th consecutive win in Sacramento dating to 2013. Thats what championship teams are about, said Leonard, who led Toronto to the title a year ago before signing with the Clippers in hopes of bringing a banner to Los Angeles. Going through playoff runs, the best players arent going to play great some nights. It might be somebody off the bench or somebody (else) starting that has a big game that propels us to win. Ivica Zubac added eight points and 13 rebounds and Maurice Harkless scored 12 points for the Clippers. Los Angeles also got a big lift from Larry Shamet and Derrick Walton Jr., who combined for 19 points. That was pivotal on a night when George shot 6 of 25 and Leonard was 8 of 21. We just kind of hung in there, Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. We went zone a little bit and changed our look. I just like our defense. The Clippers played without Patrick Beverley and sixth man Lou Williams. Beverley is nursing a sprained right wrist he injured during Saturday nights loss in Utah, while Williams missed the game because of personal reasons. Richaun Holmes had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. The Kings have lost eight straight. They pushed us around out there and they had their way, Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. We have to come together and weve got to be mentally stronger, physically stronger and fight our way out of it. Thats the only way to get out of this type of slump that were in, and weve done it before. Three days after a 13-point loss to Utah, Los Angeles took control in the first half despite both George and Leonard struggling offensively. The All-Stars missed 17 of their first 24 shots combined. Both got going after the break. Leonard made five of seven shots in the third quarter, and George  who missed eight of his first nine shots beyond the arc  made a 3 to open the fourth. George added another 3-pointer later that put the Clippers ahead 103-86. I had the mindset of just go and attack, be aggressive, be physical, George said. I got the spots I wanted to. I got to the shots I wanted to. But its just that stretch for me right now where the balls not going down. Even with Leonard and George struggling most of the first half, the Clippers still built a big lead on the slumping Kings late in the second quarter. Shamets 3-pointer gave Los Angeles a 57-40 halftime lead. Leonard got going in the third and the Clippers went on a 9-2 run to extend their lead to 19. Montrezl Harrell tipped in an offensive rebound then made a pair of free throws that made it 85-66. WIN, THEN LOSE, THEN WIN The Clippers have alternated wins and losses over the past nine games. George said thats indicative of a team with new players still trying to adjust. Weve probably got one game under our belt where everybodys been healthy, George said. Were still learning each other. Our winning streaks going to come, sooner than later I believe. TIP-INS Clippers: Beverley was injured Saturday against Utah. Although X-rays taken on his wrist were negative, Beverley is expected to miss a handful of games. Kings: DeAaron Fox had nine points and six assists after sitting out most of two games because of back spasms.  Sacramentos losing streak is its longest since an eight-game stretch two seasons ago.","401161141"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry kept injury-ravaged Toronto rolling along by finishing off 2019 with another 20-point performance. Lowry scored 24 points, Terence Davis matched his career high with 19 and the Raptors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 117-97 on Tuesday night. Serge Ibaka had 20 points and 10 rebounds and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 14 points in his first start with Toronto as the Raptors recorded their fifth straight home win over the Cavaliers. Toronto won for the fourth time in seven games since losing starters Pascal Siakam (groin), Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and Norman Powell (left shoulder) to injury. Lowry, who did not speak to reporters, has scored 20 or more in eight of his past nine games. He had 14 in a Christmas Day loss to Boston. ""Kyle Lowry is a Hall of Famer,"" Cleveland's Tristan Thompson said. ""He's a five-time All-Star, Olympic gold medalist, an NBA champ. He's their backbone. ""He keeps this ship running and he's playing at a high level. Kyle's a bulldog, he's going to compete every night. That's why his teammates always love him."" Collin Sexton scored 22 points and Thompson had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who had won four of five. Kevin Love returned to the starting lineup with 10 points and 11 rebounds and Cedi Osman scored 14 points for Cleveland. Cleveland coach John Beilein said Lowry and Fred VanVleet deserved most of the credit for Toronto's latest triumph. ""In today's game, two guards like that, despite their size, can dominate,"" Beilein said. ""They really dominated the game today."" The Raptors are 13-1 when they lead through three quarters at home. Toronto lost 98-97 to Oklahoma City on Sunday despite taking an 80-76 lead into the fourth. Sexton said the Raptors seemed intent on wiping away the memories of Sunday's defeat. ""They had a chip on their shoulder,"" Sexton said. ""They wanted to pretty much just beat us. You could tell from the very start of the game that they had a different type of energy."" OG Anunoby and VanVleet each scored 12 points in the Raptors' second 20-point win over Cleveland this season. The Cavaliers lost 133-113 at Toronto on Dec. 16. Toronto had lost three of four, but won for the 14th time in 19 home games. The Raptors went 9-7 in December, their busiest month of the season. Hollis-Jefferson started in place of Anunoby, who shot 0 for 7 from 3-point range in Sunday's loss to Oklahoma City and had missed 17 of 19 from distance over his previous five games. ""Seemed like it worked out OK, they both played really well tonight,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""I liked the energy from both of them."" The Raptors recorded an assist on nine of their 10 baskets in the opening quarter. Lowry fed Anunoby for a 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left to give Toronto a 27-25 lead after one. The lead changed 10 times in the opening quarter, but didn't change again the rest of the way. Lowry scored 11 points in the second and Toronto used six 3-pointers to outscore Cleveland 32-18, scoring the final seven points of the quarter to take a 59-43 lead at halftime. ""We just buried ourselves at the end of that first half,"" Beilein said. Cleveland shot 2 for 12 from 3-point range in the second. Toronto led 86-69 through three quarters. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love sat out Saturday's win at Minnesota because of a sore right hip. . The Cavs shot 10 for 38 from 3-point range. . Cleveland is 4-13 on the road. .

"HOUSTON --  Now that the Houston Rockets are healthy, James Harden is excited for his team's possibilities. But he knows there will be ups and downs as his teammates figure out how to play together. Harden scored 35 points after missing the last game with an injury to lead the Rockets to a 130-104 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night. The Rockets were back to full strength after Harden missed his first game of the season because of a sprained right toe in a loss to New Orleans on Sunday. Clint Capela (bruised heel) and Russell Westbrook (load management) also returned after sitting out on Sunday in the 127-112 defeat. They got Eric Gordon back on Sunday after the guard sat out for about six weeks after arthroscopic knee surgery. We've just got to find a way, Harden said. It will get there. We're not where we want to be obviously. It's still early in the season. But we've got to find a way to sustain it for four quarters and once we get that it's going to be pretty tough to beat us. Houston pushed a small lead to a big advantage with a 19-3 run to start the fourth quarter. The Rockets were up by 17 when Harden scored five quick points, with a 3-pointer, to make it 118-96 with about 3 1/2 minutes left and end his night and that of most of Houston's starters. Nikola Jokic scored 21 points for the Nuggets, who had a two-game winning streak snapped. Our defense wasn't there all night long, Denver coach Michael Malone said. The turnovers were too much. Give them credit, they're a good team, but a really disappointing fourth quarter. Westbrook had 28 points for his 11th straight game with 20 or more, the longest streak by a Rockets player besides Harden since Yao Ming did it in 14 games in a row in 2006. The Nuggets used a 37-point third quarter to cut the lead to three, but the Rockets scored the first 12 points of the fourth to make it 104-89 with about 9 minutes left. Ben McLemore had two 3-pointers to power that spurt. Denver got its first points of the quarter on a 3 by Torrey Craig after that. Houston then scored the next seven points, capped by a 3 from Harden to stretch the lead to 111-92 midway through the period. Coach Mike D'Antoni was happy with the way the Rockets opened the fourth quarter, but was disappointed that they let up in the third to allow the Nuggets to cut the deficit. If you stop them and it went the other way the game could have been over (earlier), he said. But we have that tendency of letting people back in and we've got to develop better habits. Because if you want to go deep in the playoffs you can't just turn it on. The Rockets were up by 12 after a 3-pointer by Harden with about 7 minutes left in the third quarter. Jokic then scored four quick points to cut the lead to 78-70 midway through the quarter. Houston remained up by eight later in the third when Harden, who had six 3-pointers, made three free throws to push it to 86-75. The Rockets had pushed the lead to 10 with about 3 minutes left in the third before the Nuggets used an 11-4 run to cut the lead to 92-89 entering the fourth. Malik Beasley led the Nuggets in that stretch, scoring five points capped by a 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left. TIP-INS Nuggets: Paul Millsap had 13 points and nine rebounds in his return after missing two games with a bruised left knee. ... Denver made 8 of 25 3-pointers. ... Monte Morris added 18 points off the bench. Rockets: Gordon scored 12 points. ... Capela had 16 points and 10 rebounds after missing the last two games with his injury. HARTENSTEIN HEATING UP Houston center Isaiah Hartenstein had 16 points and 12 rebounds for the first double-double of his career. The performance comes after he scored a career-high 19 points on Sunday filling in for Capela. Hartenstein is averaging 14.7 points and 11.3 rebounds in the last three games.","401161143"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs and Golden State Warriors are experiencing a level of mediocrity unseen in the tenures of their veteran coaches. Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr aren't letting their teams throw in the towel. That was abundantly clear as they battled into overtime. DeMar DeRozan had 24 points and the San Antonio Spurs escaped with a 117-113 overtime victory over the short-handed Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night. San Antonio improved to 4-1 in overtime this season. Four of those games have come at home. ""It's more so familiar territory now,"" DeRozan said. ""So, we've got out there and grind it out."" Dejounte Murray scored seven of his 15 points in overtime, as San Antonio (14-18) won for the eighth time in 13 games to finish the year below .500 for the first time since 1996. ""We're just trying to stay in the moment,"" Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge said. ""Watch film and see the things that we need to keep doing better and focus on them and just build from there."" Golden State lost its second straight after a season-high four-game winning streak. The Warriors -- already without stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson long-term -- were without starters D'Angelo Russell and Willie Cauley-Stein. At 9-26, Golden State has already lost more games than in any of its previous five seasons under Kerr. The Warriors won 436 games and three championships in Kerr's first five seasons. ""The first five years were exceptional, they weren't normal,"" Kerr said. ""So, I try to look at things from a realistic perspective. What's happening this year is more in line with what generally happens to NBA teams."" Still, Kerr has found a bright spot in helping resurrect the careers of Glenn Robinson III, Alec Burks and Marquis Criss. Burks had 28 points and Robinson added 25, including 15 in the first quarter. Draymond Green had 10 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in 36 minutes. ""We're having a productive season; we're just not having a winning season,"" Kerr said. ""I've enjoyed coaching this team, I just told them that. I enjoy coming in every day and working with these guys because they play hard, they play for each other and they care about that game. So, I'm not too concerned about the record."" The teams traded the lead four times and were tied twice in the final 3 minutes of regulation. DeRozan's 17-footer with 17.1 seconds left gave San Antonio a 100-98 lead, but Robinson tied it eight seconds later with a 21-footer set up by Green's shovel pass. Aldridge missed a 15-footer at the close of regulation. Aldridge added 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Patty Mills had 18 points. Murray was 3 for 3 from the field in overtime, including a 3-pointer, and had a steal and an assist. ""He came through big, but I always expect Dejounte to come up big for us,"" Spurs guard Bryn Forbes said. Golden State grabbed a 51-42 lead in the second quarter as San Antonio went scoreless for three minutes. Aldridge ended the drought with an off-balance, fadeaway 3-pointer as the shot clock expired. The Warriors were 12 for 27 on 3-pointers, including consecutive 3s to open the second half and stretch their advantage to 61-53 in the third quarter. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said Russell, who injured his right shoulder in a collision with Dallas' Luca Doncic on Saturday, will be evaluated Wednesday. ... Golden State started its 16th different lineup in 35 games this season. ... The Warriors have had 99 players appear in at last one game since Jan. 1, 2010. ... Kerr clarified the status of Cauley-Stein, who was listed as ""doubtful"" due to an undisclosed illness. ""Willie is not in San Antonio, so he's beyond doubtful,"" Kerr joked. Spurs: Popovich and the Spurs closed the decade with 554 victories, the most by any coach and franchise in the league. Oklahoma City was second with 514 wins and Golden State third with 505. Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who previously coached in Boston, is second to Popovich with 493 victories.","401161144"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder seems to thrive on fourth-quarter pressure, as evidenced by their latest comeback on Tuesday night. Danilo Gallinari and Dennis Schroder each scored 20 points, Chris Paul hit the go-ahead basket with 40 seconds left and the Thunder rallied from a seven-point deficit in the final three minutes to beat the Dallas Mavericks 106-101. Paul scored 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter and added eight rebounds and seven assists for the Thunder, who have won seven of their last eight games to move into seventh place in the Western Conference. During that stretch, they've also had comebacks from 26, 24 and 18 points down to win. The Thunder (18-15) are three games above .500 for the first time this season. ""The really good teams in our league, the last four or five minutes, they really lock down and tighten up,"" Paul said. ""That's what we did. We've got to figure out how to put the whole game together, but I'm happy with what we've been doing."" Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 35 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, but he and Maxi Kleber each missed a potential tying 3-point attempt in the final seconds. ""We got two pretty good looks, I would say,"" Doncic said. ""We think that in any game, but the ball just didn't go in, so I hope the next time it goes in."" Dallas played without usual starters Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr., who missed the game due to injuries. ""We're not going to be an excuse team,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We're not going to go there. We've just got to execute a little bit better at both ends. It's a one-possession game up until the last part of the game, so one more make and one more miss one way or the other and the thing's different. But that's the NBA now. There's a very thin margin for error and you've got to be really good at both ends."" Dallas led by as many as 12 points in the first half thanks to 23 points by Doncic, who was listed as questionable to play after he suffered a left wrist sprain and back contusion after taking a hard fall on Sunday against the Los Angeles Lakers. But the Thunder closed to within 51-50 by halftime and twice led by six points in the third quarter before Dallas took a 78-77 lead into the fourth quarter. Dallas led 99-92 after a 3-pointer by Doncic with 2:56 left, but Oklahoma City took a 102-101 lead when Paul hit a 17-foot jumper. Gallinari -- who missed the Thunder's previous four games due to a sore left ankle -- poked the basketball away from Doncic at the other end, leading to two free throws by Schroder with 19.9 seconds left. ""I was just trying to play defense off the scouting report,"" Gallinari said. ""He likes to go left rather than right, so I knew he was going to get back to his left hand. It was a good play."" After Kleber and Doncic both missed their 3-point attempts, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sealed the win with two free throws with 2.9 seconds left. Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. ""We just want to win and we're starting to figure out what we need to do, specifically, on both ends of the floor to get the win, and we're doing it,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas hit 15 of 51 3-point attempts, the 21st straight game in which the Mavericks have made at least 10 3-pointers. . Doncic's 17 first-quarter points tied for the most by a Thunder opponent in a quarter this season. D'Angelo Russell had 17 in a quarter for Golden State on Nov. 9 . It was the third straight year in which the Mavericks played at Oklahoma City on New Year's Eve. Thunder: Guard Hamidou Diallo played for the first time since hyperextending his right elbow on Nov. 22 against the Lakers. He scored four points. ... The Thunder won despite making only 6 of 27 3-point attempts ... Centers Steven Adams (10 points, 11 rebounds) and Nerlens Noel (12 points, 12 rebounds) each had a double-double. DALLAS STARTERS OUT Hardaway sat out due to a left hamstring injury sustained in the loss to the Lakers. Carlisle said before the game he doesn't know when Hardaway will be ready to play again. Jalen Brunson replaced Hardaway in the starting lineup and scored seven points. Porzingis also missed the game due to right knee soreness. His absence was unexpected, as he had been listed in the starting lineups that were delivered to the media and scorers before the tipoff. Kleber started in place of Porzingis and played well, finishing with 14 points and a career-high 14 rebounds.""We've got a deep roster,"" Carlisle said. ""We're very capable of having guys step up and step forward.""","401161145"
"WASHINGTON --  Orlando forward Jonathan Isaac collided with the Washington Wizards' Bradley Beal in the early minutes of Wednesday's game. Isaac left the floor on a stretcher, and was quickly ruled out of the game with a hyperextended left knee. Yet, even with one of their key players out, the Magic, who entered with the NBA's worst offense, overcame Isaac's absence and rolled to a 122-101 win over the Wizards. D.J. Augustin scored a season-high 25 points and Nicola Vucevic added 20 points and 12 rebounds. as Orlando snapped a four-game road losing streak. After the game, Isaac felt he'd avoided a serious injury. He will have an MRI on the knee on Thursday and be re-evaluated. I've never hurt my knee before, Isaac said. So as soon as it happened, I just naturally start thinking the worst. 'Wow man, it's over.' But as I was down there, it started to feel better and better just being down there. So I kind of felt, just the reassurance that I was going to be (OK). The Magic took the lead midway through the second quarter and led 62-58 at halftime. Orlando steadily increased its lead in the second half. I thought we played a good first half, and that second half was about as well as we've played, coach Steve Clifford said. Good offense, good defense, and D.J. was phenomenal. Evan Fournier had 18 points for Orlando. Markelle Fultz scored 16 and Terrence Ross 15. Clifford was relieved after watching the collision, which occurred near the Magic bench. It's scary because, to be honest, I think we got lucky,"" Clifford said. I was right there, and the way it twisted, I thought I heard a pop and usually that's bad. Beal, who returned from a two-game absence due to soreness in his right leg, had 27 points to lead Washington. The Magic have beaten the Wizards in each of their three meetings this season. We were a step slow, Washington coach Scott Brooks said. We didn't fly around and create energy and offense with our activity tonight. We seemed to be a step behind on every play. TIP-INS Magic: Clifford said the passing of longtime NBA commissioner David Stern was enormous. Just a brilliant man. And they say a sign of leadership is not just that you have a definitive vision, but that other people will follow your lead. And certainly, thats what he did. Clifford said. ... F Aaron Gordon was out for the second straight game with a sore left Achilles. Wizards: Brooks mourned Stern's death. We lost a legend, an icon, somebody I had a great deal of respect for when I played and also when I became a coach. Impacted the game in incredible ways and we wouldnt be in our position as a league if it wasnt for his guidance for the many, many great years the league had. FULTZ'S ASSIST Midway through the third quarter, Fultz threw a spinning, behind-the-back pass to Fournier for a dunk, and he was pleased with it. I think that's stuff I used to do on the playground with my friends, Fultz said. A lot of my close friends have seen me do stuff like that, but as far in the NBA, that's probably one of my top passes. BEAL'S BACK: Beal played 30 minutes after missing the last two games, and said he wasn't sure if he'd sit out one of this weekend's back-to-back home games. Prior to the injury, Beal played 194 consecutive games. When I came in to the league, my first couple of years, everbody was always saying I couldn't stay on the floor, and I was injury-prone Beal said. That was something I wanted to get off of my resume, I guess. I didn't want that title. I didn't want that name.","401161146"
"NEW YORK --  The shots were falling. The crowd was roaring. Everything was set up for this to be Carmelo Anthony's night. Then he sat down to start the fourth quarter, and the Knicks had ruined those hopes by the time he got back up. Mitchell Robinson made all 11 shots and had 22 points, Julius Randle added 22 points and 13 rebounds, and New York spoiled Anthony's strong return to Madison Square Garden by beating the Portland Trail Blazers 117-93 on Wednesday for its season-high third straight victory. Anthony scored 26 points, his most since returning to the NBA in November after a year absence, and was cheered before and during the game at the arena where he played 6 1/2 seasons. But he was on the bench at the start of the Knicks' 14-0 run early in the fourth quarter that broke open the game and sent the Trail Blazers to their fifth straight loss. ""Overall, the experience and just being back today I think is the most important thing,"" Anthony said. ""The loss is something that we'll get to the bottom of. We'll figure it out. It happens. You have to take your hat off to those guys, they played extremely well tonight. The way that they shot the ball, the way that they were locked in, they deserved to win tonight."" Reggie Bullock made two 3-pointers during the spurt and scored 11 points in his Knicks debut. He signed with the team during the summer but hadn't played because of a herniated disk. ""It's just great to be back out there seeing the ball go through the hoop and playing out there with my teammates,"" Bullock said. ""I signed here for a reason, and I knew what the guys that we signed were capable of doing. I'm glad to be out there playing with them."" Damian Lillard was held to 11 points on 5-for-20 shooting after scoring 30 or more in the previous three games. The All-Star guard did have 10 rebounds and eight assists, but missed his first six 3-pointers before making his only one of the game. That was on the final shot of the third quarter, cutting New York's lead to 83-77, and he then joined Anthony on the bench. The Blazers were still down just six after consecutive baskets by CJ McCollum, but Bullock made his two 3s and Frank Ntilikina and Bobby Portis hit one apiece in between. Portis then finished the run with two free throws to push the lead to 101-81. Anthony, who shot 4 for 16 in a loss to Phoenix on Monday, and Lillard returned when the lead reached 12 but by then the Knicks were already rolling. ""Offensively it was good to see Melo have a game, but as I said at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Melo and Dame were out and that's kind of when they made their run and it got away from us,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Anthony was loudly cheered when he was the last Portland player introduced during starting lineups and many times when he had the ball. But the cheers were soon for Robinson, whose high-flying performance tied the Knicks record for most makes without a miss. He said he was motivated after his team was beaten badly in practice Tuesday by starting forward Marcus Morris' squad, who taunted the losers. ""I came in the game (tonight) and just dominated and couldn't do it without them,"" Robinson said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland started a five-game road trip and doesn't play its first home game of 2020 until Jan. 11, when it hosts Milwaukee. ... It was Anthony's 20th career game against the Knicks. He was averaging 27.8 points, his most against any opponent Knicks: Snapped a six-game losing streak in the series. ... Ntilikina had nine points and 10 assists. ... Portis scored 17 points. SALUTING STERN There was a moment of silence before the game for former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who died Wednesday at 77. Stern grew up a Knicks fan, and current team president Steve Mills previously worked under him at the NBA. ""David Stern was not only one of the greatest commissioners in the history of sports, he was an incredible individual and friend. He was loyal and fair, patient and wise, and made all of us who had the privilege of knowing him better,"" Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan said in a statement. ""The NBA will stand forever as a testament to his lasting legacy and all those who worked with him or for him, sat next to him or across the table from him are better because of it.""","401161147"
"MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Bucks were happy to get another win though they know they didn't play up to their standards. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 17 rebounds, and the Bucks held off a strong challenge from short-handed Minnesota in a 106-104 victory over the Timberwolves on Wednesday night. ""Not paying our best but still finding a way to win is good,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""But this isn't the formula."" Antetokounmpo got his 30th double-double in 33 games this season and Khris Middleton added 13 points despite shooting 5 for 18 as league-best Milwaukee hit just 42.6% of its shots overall and only 9 of 36 from 3-point range. Brook Lopez scored 11 points and Eric Bledsoe had 10. ""We missed a lot of good shots and came out a little slow,"" Middleton said. Shabazz Napier had 22 points to lead Minnesota, and Gorgui Deng scored 15, Josh Okogie added 12 and Jarret Culver 10. Minnesota was playing without its two best players as Karl-Anthony Towns and Jeff Teague sat with knee injuries. The Timberwolves were also missing Treveon Graham and Andrew Wiggins, who were battling flu-like symptoms. ""That presented a lot of opportunities for a lot of guys and I thought a lot of guys stepped up,"" Napier said. Napier, starting in place of Teague, scored 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting in the first half, but then had just seven after the break. Milwaukee slumped out of the gate. The Bucks had just four points through the first six minutes and didn't take a lead until Lopez converted a three-point play to make it 31-29 with 8:41 left in the second quarter. They went into halftime with a 52-51 lead despite shooting 34% from the floor. Minnesota connected at a 41.7% clip but made only 3 of 14 3-pointers while the Bucks knocked down 8 of 26 from beyond the arc. A 15-6 run capped off by Antetokounmpo's 3 out of halftime put the Bucks ahead by 10 and they took a 77-71 lead into the fourth. Culver's driving dunk over Lopez got the Timberwolves within a basket with 9:38 to play but he was called for a technical foul on the play that ultimately set up Kyle Korver's 3 to put the Bucks back up by six, 87-81 with 8:45 remaining. Minnesota responded with five straight points to pull within one but Antetokounmpo's driving layup and Middleton's 3 snuffed out the rally. The Timberwolves mounted one last challenge in the closing minute as Dieng hit the first of two free throws to make it 106-104 with 46.2 seconds left. Robert Covington grabbed Pat Connaughton's missed layup, giving Minnesota the ball with 21 seconds left but after the Timberwolves used their last timeout, Dieng missed a 19-footer with 3 seconds remaining. ""We were hoping to get Shabazz on a quick catch and go or we liked going for a win with (Covington) getting to the corner,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""There is a reason they are arguably the best defense team in the league too, they blew it up."" BUILDING UP BLEDSOE Bledsoe played 20 minutes in his second game back after missing two weeks with a leg injury. And while he shot only 4 for 10 shots, he also added 6 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 blocked shots. ""That is what (Bledsoe) does,"" Middleton said. ""His speed, his pace, we call him big car, just how big and strong he is. For us to play well, we are going to need him out there."" BIG NIGHT FOR NAPIER Napier hit the 20-point mark for the second time this season. The veteran point guard came into the contest averaging 8.1 points on 34.5 percent shooting in 19 games this season but knocked down 7 of 13 shots against the Bucks including 4 of 7 from distance while adding six rebounds three assists and a blocked shot in 31 minutes. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Karl-Anthony Towns worked out before the game with a sleeve on his injured left leg but still doesn't have a timetable to return. ... Towns has missed the last eight games. Bucks: SG Wesley Matthews sat out for a second straight game because of a bruised right thigh but Budenholzer said he expected Matthews to be fine and available possibly as early as this weekend.","401161148"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Lakers built a huge early lead against Phoenix only to see it shrink to single digits. They still won their third in a row, but considered it a lesson learned. LeBron James notched his eighth triple-double of the season, Anthony Davis had 26 points and 11 rebounds, and the Western Conference leaders opened the new year with a 117-107 victory on Wednesday night. We can't allow ourselves to fall into a trap like that, Davis said. You got to learn how to handle success within games. James finished with 31 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a game that appeared well in hand by the end of a dominant first quarter. He had double-figure points and assists by halftime. We wanted to get off to a good start and protect home as well as we can, James said. The Suns rallied in the fourth, getting within seven points after trailing by 36 earlier in the game. That forced the Lakers' starters back in, and James steadied them with eight points to close out the win. You always got to be engaged until the clock hits zero, James said. The Lakers shot 70% in a ferocious opening quarter when they made their first 11 shots. Danny Green had their first miss on a 3-point attempt, but the Lakers controlled the offensive rebound and JaVale McGee found Green for a dunk. I'm asking our guys to dominate everybody they play, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. Our guys took that message to heart. The Lakers missed just eight attempts in the first. James airballed a shot, but they snagged the rebound and Avery Bradley scored to salvage the possession. The Lakers put together a 25-4 run in which the Suns were limited to only free throws. Among the highlights, Davis dunked over Aron Baynes and let out a roar, and later Davis threw down a reverse dunk on James' pass. Not to be outshone, James followed with a two-handed jam that ignited the crowd. Los Angeles led 43-17 at the end of the quarter. Kyle Kuzma, sporting blond hair, had three 3-pointers in the second. Bradley scored on a smooth behind-the-back pass from James. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope beat the shot clock with a casual heave on a 3-pointer. Dwight Howard chipped in eight points and the Lakers shot 61% in taking a 74-41 lead into halftime. Kuzma added 19 points and Bradley had a season-high 18. Devin Booker scored 32 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 26 for the Suns. Phoenix had won two in a row after losing eight straight. We turned it up a notch in the second half and came out swinging, Booker said. We did it with defense and a will to play and a competitive spirit. We know we can do it. We'll figure it out. Anytime you go 2-2 on a road trip, it's a good road trip. TIP-INS Suns: Booker has scored 30 or more points in a season-high four straight games. ... They fell to 1-4 all-time playing on New Year's Day; it was their first such contest since 1983. ... They were held to a season-low 17 points in the first quarter. ... The Suns gave up a season-worst 74 points in the first half. ... Frank Kaminsky III missed his second straight game because of a right knee injury. Lakers: They improved to 18-0 against teams under .500 this season and more such opponents are coming up: New Orleans, Detroit and New York. ... Howard notched his 1,000th career steal. ... Their 43 points in the first quarter were a season high. ... Alex Caruso had right calf tightness and didn't return. ... Green and McGee stayed loose by jumping rope on court during a timeout in the fourth. REMEMBERING STERN There was a moment of silence for former NBA commissioner David Stern who died Wednesday at 77. We lost a great visionary, James said. Him and Dr. James Naismith are the two most important people in basketball. James recalled the day he was drafted he spoke to Stern behind the scenes. He told me he wanted to wear my suit one day, James said, laughing. James said something should be named after Stern, much like the NBA championship trophy is named for Larry O'Brien. RUBIO'S SLIP Ricky Rubio said he hurt his hip after slipping on a wet spot on the court and left the game in the closing minutes. I don't know yet if I'll be able to play the next game, he said. Rubio had six points on 2-of-7 shooting and nine assists for the Suns. WORKING HIS WAY BACK Phoenix's DeAndre Ayton scored 16 points in his second game back from a sprained right ankle. He pulled down a game-high 14 rebounds in 31 minutes. I'm trying to get my rhythm back, he said. ""We got down early but we woke up in the second half. I take this personal and I'm taking it home with me. We need to start games the way we ended the game and put fear into our opponents and pressure the rim.""","401161149"
"CLEVELAND --  Devonte Graham hit the biggest shot of the game. And then his coach came up with a clutch timeout. Graham hit a 3-pointer with 26 seconds left to break a tie and cap Charlotte's late rally in the Hornets' 109-106 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday night. ""It was late in the clock, so I just let it fly,"" said Graham, who had 16 points after being held scoreless in the first half. Graham's shot from about 30 feet at the the top of the key gave Charlotte a 106-103 lead, but coach James Borrego's timeout a few seconds later might have saved the game. Graham hit two free throws with 9.7 seconds left for a 108-103 lead. After Cedi Osman's 3-pointer made it 108-106 with four seconds remaining, Dwyane Bacon's pass from under the basket went out of bounds. Because the ball wasn't touched by a Cleveland player, Cavaliers coach John Beilien and his players erupted in protest when it was ruled Charlotte maintained possession. The Cavaliers were then informed that the Hornets were awarded timeout an instant before the ball was thrown in. ""I know we turned it over,"" Borrego said. ""The ball went out of bounds. I think we were very fortunate there."" Cavaliers guard Collin Sexton was close to the play, but wasn't aware the timeout had been called. He also thought the Cavaliers' failure to hold the lead played a bigger role in the loss. ""It could have went either way,"" he said. ""Once he (Bacon) got it, it went through the net and he threw it out real quick. We shouldn't have been in that position."" Terry Rozier hit a foul shot with 3.6 seconds left, giving Cleveland a final chance but Sexton's 3-pointer from just inside halfcourt bounced off the rim. ""When I shot it, it felt looked good, felt good,"" Sexton said. ""I was feeling it and I let it go. It was right on target, but I missed it."" The Hornets came back from a nine-point deficit with five minutes to play to end a six-game losing streak Rozier led the Hornets with 30 points while Graham also had 11 assists. Bacon scored 15 points and P.J. Washington had 14. Cleveland led 100-91 with 5:31 to play before Charlotte rallied. Sexton scored 21 points, and Kevin Love had 18 for Cleveland. TIP-INS Hornets: F Marvin Williams left the game in the second half with what was announced as ""nasal trauma"" after being hit in the face. Borrego said Williams' status will be updated Friday. ... Graham and starting forward Miles Bridges were held scoreless in the first half. ... G Nicolas Batum missed his fourth straight game as a result of a coach's decision.. Cavaliers: G Dante Exum, appearing in his fourth game since being acquired on Dec. 23, scored seven points in 12 minutes. He was picked up from Utah for G Jordan Clarkson. ... Cleveland opened a four-game homestand. HE LIKES IT HERE Rozier played high school basketball in suburban Shaker Heights. He scored a career-high 35 points against the Cavaliers on Dec. 18 and has hit 13 of 27 on 3-pointers in the two games in his hometown. ""Maybe we'll send him to Cleveland any time he needs a jolt,"" Borrego said. TOUGH ENDING Beilein was unhappy the Cavaliers couldn't finish off the Hornets especially after building a double-figure lead midway through the final quarter. ""Really disappointing, that one,"" he said. ""I don't think I'd say that I think we had it, but we played well enough at times. I told the team that when we look back at it there are going to be segments where we didn't play very good defense. They got layups or dunks or an open three that came back to haunt us.""","401161150"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Denver Nuggets rookie Michael Porter Jr. took command on his hometown stage Thursday night. He repeatedly beat Pacers defenders and even occasionally the shot clock with his nifty drives to the hoop. He knocked down 3-pointers. He even upstaged All-Star teammate Nikola Jokic. Porter scored a season-high 25 points, helping the Nuggets battle back from a double-digit deficit in the first half and leading them past Indiana, 124-116. ""It was cool,"" said Porter, whose first appearance on the Bankers Life Fieldhouse floor came as a fourth grader. ""I was hitting some of my shots and doing some of my moves that I used to do, so I felt pretty good out there."" It probably looked familiar to some in the crowd, too. Porter spent Wednesday reminiscing with old grade-school buddies from an Indianapolis suburb and invited them to his first NBA appearance on the Pacers' home court. He couldn't have written a more perfect script. Porter helped the Nuggets get back on track after they gave up 37 first-quarter points, helped them take control late in the third quarter and was still playing well enough to help them close it out -- with some help from his teammates. He wound up 11 of 12 from the field, 2 of 3 on 3-pointers, grabbed five rebounds and had one big assist. And on a night Jokic struggled because of foul trouble, the Nuggets needed someone else to step forward. Yes, Jokic finished with 22 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, and seven rebounds. But it was Porter who drew the rave reviews. ""It's another glimpse into a very bright future,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He just got his first postgame water celebration, the guys dumped him. Everybody on the bench was happy for him."" Jeremy Lamb had a season-high 30 points for the Pacers, who have lost four of six. Domantas Sabonis had 18 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, falling just short of his first career triple-double for the second time this week. But it was a frustrating night for the Pacers, who led the entire first half and never trailed until another Indiana native, Gary Harris, knocked down a 3-pointer with 9:16 left in the third quarter to make it 73-72. Lamb answered with a 3, which turned the game into a back-and-forth contest until Monte Morris closed out the the third with a 3-pointer and an 18-foot jumper -- off a rebound and pass from Porter -- to give the Nuggets a 92-88 lead. Denver opened the fourth by outscoring Indiana 11-6 to make it 103-94 and the Pacers could only get as close as 107-104 with 6:31 to go. Jokic and Porter scored eight of Denver's next 10 points to seal the victory. ""You have to tip your cap to him,"" Turner said, referring to Porter. ""I've been following his career and I think he's been through a lot. It's cool and refreshing to see someone like that go off and have a good game. You hope, obviously, it's against someone else."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Will Barton III had 16 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. ... Jamal Murray also had 22 points. ... Harris returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games with a bruised left shin and finished with 12 points. ...

"MIAMI --  They spent more than two hours working on defense in an unusually long practice on Wednesday. And on Thursday, the Miami Heat showed what they learned. Bam Adebayo had 15 points and 14 rebounds, and the Heat put together their best defensive performance of the season in an 84-76 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Thursday night. The Raptors' scoring total was their lowest in more than four years -- also coming in a game at Miami on Nov. 8, 2015 -- and the second-lowest by any team in the NBA this season. ""We took it to heart,"" Adebayo said. ""We need to defend and that's what we did tonight."" Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic each scored 13 points for Miami, which is now 2-0 against the Raptors this season and improved to 9-0 after a loss. The Heat and Milwaukee are the only teams to not lose consecutive games this season. Derrick Jones Jr. scored 10 points and Jimmy Butler finished with eight points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for Miami. ""It was all about defense,"" Dragic said. ""We feel like we play a great team defense, we help each other. Most of the time we were in zone. A great team win, let's go to the next one."" Serge Ibaka had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. Kyle Lowry scored 15 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 13 and OG Anunoby had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Raptors shot only 31.5% and were 6 for 42 from 3-point range. ""If we make five more 3s we win the game,"" Lowry said. ""Still, give them credit, a great game plan and a great job by them, but it's something we'll look at and figure out for next time. The next team who plays zone I'm sure we're not going to shoot that bad."" There was a pregame tribute and moment of silence for former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who died Wednesday at the age of 77. Both the Raptors and the Heat were born under Stern's leadership of the league. ""There probably is some serendipity to this game, to have the expansion of the league ... it's a byproduct of his leadership and vision,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami set a season-best for points allowed by a huge margin; the previous Heat low in that department this season was 94 against New Orleans on Nov. 16. Toronto's previous season low for points was 88, in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 11. Anunoby was fouled on a 3-point try with 1:21 left in the third, making all three free throws to tie the game at 60. It was Toronto's second time cashing in on such a foul in the game, after Lowry went 3 for 3 in that situation late in the first quarter. But the Heat went on a 17-5 run in the fourth and held Toronto to 16 points in the final 12 minutes. ""They didn't make much more than us, but they made just enough to get the win so give those guys credit,"" said Raptors guard Fred VanVleet, who was 3 for 16 from the field and 1 for 11 from 3-point range.

And with Miami taking a 63-60 lead into the fourth, it became only the second game this season with teams at those totals -- the other was Charlotte leading Chicago 59-50 after 36 minutes on Dec. 13. TECH CENTER There were four technical fouls in the game -- leading to zero points. Spoelstra and Raptors coach Nick Nurse both got hit with techs (both resulting free throws were missed), while Lowry and Kendrick Nunn were recipients of a double-technical late in the third.","401161152"

The Jazz went on a 24-4 run in the third quarter to grab a nine-point lead and emerged with their 10th win in 12 games  after Chicago tied it in the closing minutes. Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert each scored 17 for Utah. Mitchell hit two free throws with 19 seconds remaining, and Gobert had 12 rebounds.

The Jazz got the rebound, and Mitchell hit two free throws with 19 seconds left for the final score. I hit him with the body, so I did the best I could,"" LaVine said. I didn't just want to settle for a 3, so go in there to tie it up. It just didn't happen. I didn't convert a lot of those. I thought I was getting a lot of contact, but you got to go out there and make plays. TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert got shaken up attempting a third-quarter layup when Chicago's Daniel Gafford came from behind and hit him in the head, resulting in a flagrant foul. ... The Jazz made 11 of 30 3-pointers, while the Bulls were 11 for 36 from beyond the arc. ... Bogdanovic missed all five 3's, but was 9 for 9 on free throws. Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder) missed his 16th consecutive game, though he and Boylen said the second-year pro was healthy. Hutchison has not played since Nov. 27. ... LaVine said his left ankle was sore after he turned it during the game. BIG RUNS The Bulls bridged the second and third quarters with a 15-0 run that gave them a 58-47 lead. But the Jazz responded with that 24-4 spurt. They scored 12 straight, capped by a 3-pointer from Mitchell. Chicago was up 62-61 when Utah reeled off another 10 in a row, with Georges Niang nailing a 3 to make it 71-62. We did as good a job as we have all year just staying together and staying connected at both ends even when things weren't easy, Snyder said.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  With the stars still out, the supporting cast stepped up again for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Shabazz Napier and Robert Covington each scored 20 points to help the Timberwolves beat the Golden State Warriors 99-84 on Thursday night in a matchup of injury-ravaged teams. Napier scored 20 or more for the third consecutive game. The last time he did that was Dec. 23-30, 2017, for Portland. He also had seven assists. The Timberwolves won for the second time in three games. Both wins have come without Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. ""I have always been an aggressive guard, but it makes everything else easier,"" Napier said. ""I have been trying to get other guys involved, and I have been very fortunate to make great passes and have other guys make shots."" Naz Reid added 13 points, Kelan Martin had 12 and Minnesota held Golden State to the lowest points total by an opponent this season. ""We've navigated through some injuries, some illness, been some personal circumstances that were unforeseen and in a lot of cases, we've had guys step up,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. Glen Robinson III scored 16 points for the Warriors, and Eric Paschall had 13, They have lost three straight after a four-game win streak from Dec. 20-27. ""It was disappointing, because we've had a good stretch of basketball,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""The last few weeks we've played very well. So this feels like the exception rather than the rule. But we've got to prove that's the case on Saturday."" Golden State was without D'Angelo Russell, along with long-absent stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. The Timberwolves went on an 18-3 first-quarter run and led by as many as 22 in the first half. They held Golden State to 19 points in the first quarter and 41 in the first half. ""We just got out to a slow start,"" Robinson said. ""We've been coming out with some energy, coming out better. That's on us, on the starting group. The second half, the second unit kept us in it a little bit."" The Warriors went on an 11-2 run that started in the final minute of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. They trimmed the lead to eight at 92-84 on Damion Lee's basket with 4:35 left. That was as close as they would get. Napier and Covington hit 3-pointers down the stretch, and the Timberwolves held the Warriors scoreless the rest of the way. ""We've been playing hard,"" Martin said. ""That continued on both ends. Obviously, some shots not falling, but we make up for it on the defensive end with our energy, intensity and then get out in transition and score."" Minnesota was playing for the second consecutive night. The Timberwolves improved to 2/3 when playing the second game of a back-to-back. ""As a coach, I don't know if you're ever satisfied,"" Saunders said. ""There is always work to be done, always things you could improve upon. But when it comes to energy and being engaged, that's a big positive for us on the second night of a back-to-back."" TIP-INS Warriors: Russell (right shoulder contusion), Willie Cauley-Stein (flu-like symptoms) and Kevon Looney (left abdominal soreness) joined long-term absentees Curry (left hand fracture) and Thompson (left ACL rehabilitation) in missing the game. Jordan Poole is on a G League assignment with Santa Cruz. No Warrior has appeared in every game this season. Timberwolves: Towns (left knee sprain), Wiggins (flu-like symptoms), Jeff Teague (right knee sprain), Treveon Graham (flu-like symptoms), Jake Layman (left toe sprain) and Noah Vonleh (left gluteal contusion) did not play. Two-way guard Jordan McLaughlin was recalled from Iowa of the G League on Wednesday. The Timberwolves won for only the second time this season when scoring fewer than 110 points. ON THE GLASS The Timberwolves outrebounded the Warriors 52-43. Covington led the way with 10 rebounds, while Jarrett Culver had four of Minnesota's 17 offensive rebounds. ""They competed harder than we did,"" Kerr said.","401161154"
"DALLAS --  With Luka Doncic resting and Dallas' other two top scorers out with injuries, Seth Curry kept the Mavericks even with Brooklyn until the 20-year-old phenom could take over again. Curry scored 15 of his 25 points with Doncic sitting the last half of the third quarter, before the 2019 Rookie of the Year had 15 of his 31 in the fourth as the Mavericks pulled away for a 123-111 victory over the Nets on Thursday night. Dallas avoided its first three-game losing streak of the season in the second straight game without 7-foot-3 forward Kristaps Porzingis and shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr., who together have been good for about 30 points a night. Curry made all five of his 3-pointers and was 9 of 13 overall in the fourth game with at least 20 points this season for the younger brother of Stephen Curry. ""A lot of guys can make plays and we never know who's going to get the touches or the shots that night other than Luka,"" Curry said. ""It's fun to play. Every night it seems like somebody different is making a big impact."" Maxi Kleber scored a season-high 18 points, making his first three 3-pointers and finishing 3 of 4 as the Mavericks shot 46% from long range (18 of 29) to open a six-game homestand, their longest of the season. Doncic remained tied with Jason Kidd for the franchise record for triple-doubles in one season with nine. That's in part because he had seven assists while taking more of the scoring load. Doncic had a game-high 13 rebounds. Porzingis is nursing a sore right knee -- not the one he injured in what ended up being his final game for the Knicks almost two years ago -- and Hardaway is working back from a hamstring strain. Spencer Dinwiddie led seven Brooklyn players in double figures with 19 points, but the Nets shot 33% while getting outscored 30-18 in the fourth quarter and losing their fourth straight game for the first time this season. ""We didn't get a stop,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Obviously, that's what kind of ballooned their lead and we obviously didn't make enough shots to keep pace."" Doncic started a decisive 13-4 run with a 3-pointer midway though the fourth quarter and capped it with layup for a 116-104 lead with 3:48 remaining. Curry replaced Doncic midway through the third and made five of six shots, including all three of his 3s. ""The style we play offensively is very empowered to the players,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When you get a guy like Seth that's hot, they just need to find him."" Brooklyn's Dzanan Musa scored a career-high 14 points. Taurean Prince, Joe Harris, Wilson Chandler and Theo Pinson had 11 apiece. TIP-INS Nets: G Garrett Temple missed his first game of the season with a right knee contusion. ""I think it's a short-term thing,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We collectively decided to use this game as our chance to rest it."" ... Prince was called for a first-half technical for pushing Kleber, but a review showed Kleber knocking center Jarrett Allen to the floor by leaning in with a shoulder before Prince's shove. Kleber was assessed a technical as well. Mavericks: Carlisle said there wasn't a timetable for the return of Porzingis and Hardaway. ... G/F Ryan Broekhoff is out indefinitely after fracturing his lower left leg in the final minute of Sunday's 108-95 loss to the Lakers. ... With J.J. Barea (10 points) and Justin Jackson making their first starts of the season, Broekhoff is the only Dallas player without a start. JORDAN'S QUIET RETURN DeAndre Jordan didn't hear any of the boos he used to in his first visit to Dallas since the Mavericks sent him to New York in the blockbuster seven-player trade that brought Porzingis and Hardaway almost a year ago. Jordan, who had 10 points and 10 rebounds in his fourth start, signed with the Nets in the offseason. He spurned the Mavericks in free agency after agreeing to a deal with them and was booed incessantly each time the Los Angeles Clippers visited. But he joined Dallas three years after that eventful summer of 2015 when he took a buyout from the Clippers. GETTING DEFENSIVE The Nets missed nine of their 13 shots during the decisive Dallas run in the fourth. Brooklyn was at 50% shooting for the game before the cold fourth. ""It all came down to whether we could put together a quarter of solid defense,"" Carlisle said. ""That's the game right there.""","401161155"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Chris Paul isn't slowing down in his 16th NBA season, especially against San Antonio. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 25 points, Paul added 16 and the Oklahoma City Thunder rallied to beat the Spurs 109-103 on Thursday night, snapping a nine-game skid in San Antonio. Paul has had many memorable battles against San Antonio, including the winning shot for the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2015 playoffs to eliminate the Spurs. There was no winner Thursday, but Paul dropped San Antonio again in the fourth. ""That's who he is. It's not like he's a no-name,"" San Antonio guard Lonnie Walker IV said. ""He's a great player. He made shots when it was most important, which was in the fourth quarter, and led his team to victory."" Paul had 10 points in the final quarter to help Oklahoma City win its fourth straight and overcome 30 points from San Antonio's DeMar DeRozan. ""It's always tough when you're playing against a high IQ point guard like Chris Paul,"" DeRozan said. ""Once you have knowledge of the game, there's not much you haven't seen. No matter how fast you go, at the end of the game. it's all about smarts."" The Thunder won the battle between the current seventh and eighth seeds in the Western Conference, extending their lead over the Spurs to four games. ""This is a tough place to play, tough place to win,"" Paul said. ""At some point, we could have laid down, but we're not built like that. Guys kept playing, kept competing."" That could also be said about Oklahoma City's season thus far. The Thunder (19-15) are battling for a playoff spot in what some considered a rebuilding season after the team traded All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George in the offseason. ""He's an incredible guy,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said of Paul. ""He's very, very generous. He's a great leader. Coming into an environment and a team with as many new players. For him, they're all new, having not played with anybody. The way he's tried to reach out and extend himself and build a chemistry inside our team, it's been incredible to watch."" The Thunder had a season-low four turnovers, including just one by Paul in 32 minutes. Oklahoma City had five players score at least 13 points, including 19 from Dennis Schroder. LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points for San Antonio. Aldridge finished 4 for 4 on 3-pointers two games after setting a career-high with five 3-pointers. The Spurs shot just 37% from the field in the third quarter but maintained a 76-74 lead. Gilgeous-Alexander had 15 points in the third quarter, going 2 for 2 on 3-pointers. Oklahoma City opened the final period on an 18-9 run to wrest control from San Antonio, which had led by 14 points in the first half. Paul was 5 for 7 in the final period. ""We didn't move the ball very well tonight,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I think we were on the dribble too much. We didn't really attack. I thought they attacked a lot better than we did. They just (went) straight ahead at the rim, found people, and we were too much on the dribble and never really got out of it."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City's last victory in San Antonio was Dec. 25, 2014. . Stephen Adams picked up his third foul with 7:20 remaining in the first half but remained in the game. . San Antonio native Andre Roberson has not played since rupturing his left patellar tendon on Jan. 27, 2018, against Detroit. . Oklahoma City is 7-9 on the road this season after finishing 22-19 away from home last season. Spurs: Aldridge has made a 3-pointer in five straight games, the longest streak of his career. . Jakob Poeltl has 48 blocks this season, the third most of his four-year career. Poeltl's career high is 100 blocks, which he achieved in 2018 with Toronto. .

REMEMBERING STERN The Spurs observed a moment of silence in honor of former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who died Wednesday after suffering a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12. He was 77. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich called it a ""sad time"" in the NBA and extended his condolences to Stern's wife, Dianne, and their family. ""David Stern was an iconic figure, but that's quite an understatement,"" Popovich said during Thursday's shootaround. ""What he was, was a force of nature, an amazing businessman, leader, manager (and) a man who took over in the mid-'80s as commissioner at a difficult time and was the visionary and the catalyst that made it was it is today. It's why we are all here and doing well. He started it all""","401161156"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  DeAaron Fox finally got the Kings running at the quick pace he grew accustomed to last season, and his season-high five steals helped send them on their way. Fox scored 10 of his 27 points in the final five minutes and the Kings overcame a 20-point deficit in the first half to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 128-123 on Thursday night, ending an eight-game losing streak. ""You go down 20 in the first quarter, its easy to give in,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""Thats the easier thing to do, and our guys kept scrapping and fighting, scrapping and fighting. They pulled out a hard-fought, gritty win. Thats kind of who our group is."" It's a group that hasn't had much success defensively this season while Fox has been in and out of the lineup. Fox made an immediate impact against Memphis, coming from behind to block a shot by Jaren Jackson Jr. after the Grizzlies grabbed the opening tip. Fox also had a midcourt steal and layup as part of a run in the fourth quarter when the Kings turned a two-point deficit into an eight-point lead. ""I feel like Im one of the best guys in the league that can actually go for those type of gambles, Fox said of his early block. I came up and I made a lot of plays defensively tonight. Sometimes you have to be able to take those risks and be able to make plays defensively. Walton compared Fox to a free safety in football. Hes so quick and he reads things so well that when hes really engaged and hes coming over making helps, he just gets to places so quick and hes so explosive, Walton said. It gets us out and running. Buddy Hield had 26 points and seven rebounds to help the Kings win for the first time since beating Golden State on Dec. 15. Richaun Holmes added 18 points and seven rebounds, and Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 16 points. The Kings allowed 42 points in the first quarter and 37 in the third but held the Grizzlies to 13 through the first 10  minutes of the fourth quarter, one of the best defensive stretches of the season by Waltons team. Sacramento took control with a 14-4 run after trailing 106-104 with 5:11 to go. Its the Kings largest comeback of the season. Weve got to learn how to play with a big lead like that, especially early in the game, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Weve got to know that when a teams down 20, that all those things that we made an emphasis of in the first quarter, you have to take it to another level. It kind of just slipped on us. Ja Morant, the Western Conference rookie of the month for December, had 23 points and seven assists for Memphis. Jonas Valanciunas added 18 points and 12 rebounds. The Grizzlies led 42-26 after the first quarter and took a 97-90 advantage into the fourth. Before the game a moment of silence was held for former NBA Commissioner David Stern. At halftime, a tribute to Stern played on the giant video scoreboard. Stern died Wednesday at the age of 77. TIP-INS Grizzlies: The 42 points matched the most in any quarter by Memphis this season and were five more than the Grizzlies had in a first quarter this season. Kings: The 128 points were the Kings' season high.  The King avoided their first nine-game losing streak since 2009.  Marvin Bagley III (left foot soreness) was on the court taking shots before the game. Thats considerable progress from when Bagley got hurt Dec. 26 against Minnesota and left the arena in a walking boot. There is no timetable for his return. PASSING FANCY The Grizzlies dished out 31 assists, the 12th time this season theyve had 30 or more. Thats tied for second-most in franchise history and one shy of the record set last season.

"LOS ANGELES --  On a night when Paul George only played half a game, the Los Angeles Clippers had plenty in reserve. Bench stars Montrezl Harrell scored 23 points and Lou Williams added 22 in a 126-112 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night that gave the Clippers consecutive wins for the first time since Dec. 13. George didn't return after halftime because of left hamstring tightness. He finished with 12 points. He'll be evaluated on Friday. ""Nothing happened. He just felt tightness,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We just decided not to bring him back."" Kawhi Leonard scored 18 in three quarters for the Clippers, who had alternated wins and losses for nearly three weeks. Bruce Brown led nine Pistons in double figures with 15 points. Andre Drummond added 10 points and 12 rebounds. They've lost four in a row on the road and eight of nine overall. Trailing by nine, the Clippers took control in the second quarter. They outscored the Pistons 35-20, including runs of 9-0 and 10-0, to take a 69-63 lead into halftime. George hit back-to-back 3-pointers and Leonard followed with another 3. Seven different Clippers scored in the spurts. ""Everybody is ready when their name is called,"" Harrell said. ""We're not really relying on one or two people. We just carried over our defensive mentality in the game and came out with a big win."" Once George was sidelined, his teammates stepped up. Landry Shamet hit consecutive 3-pointers that extended the lead to 18 points in the third. Maurice Harkless, who started, Williams and Harrell combined to score 13 of the Clippers' final 15 points and send them into the fourth leading 106-79. ""I enjoyed our third quarter coming out with energy and holding them to 16 points,"" Leonard said. ""We got out in transition, we ran the floor. We adjusted at halftime and did a good job defensively."" Detroit scored on consecutive possessions just once in the third. ""I suggested at halftime that maybe we should play a little bit of defense cause we hadn't,"" Rivers said. Harrell and Williams anchored the second unit in the fourth when the starters rested. The Pistons outscored the Clippers 33-20, but they had too big a deficit to overcome. ""I liked the way we started the game and the way we ended it,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I liked our intensity and all of our young guys did a great job. If we would have played like that in the third quarter it would have been interesting."" TIP-INS Pistons: They're on a trip with at least one game in each time zone for the first time since Dec. 5-16, 1979. ... Nearly two years after Blake Griffin's shocking trade from the Clippers to Detroit, he's the only one of six players involved still on either roster. Clippers: Patrick Beverley is expected back in the next couple games from a sprained right wrist. ... At 10-5, they tied for the league's third-best record in December. ... So far the Clippers have scored at least 130 points in six games, tied for second-most in the NBA. NEW YEAR'S SON Williams had a son born on New Year's Eve named Syx (pronounced six), a reference to Williams being a three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year. ""I just wanted to do something different,"" he said. Williams was in Sacramento with the team when he got word that girlfriend Rece Mitchell was going into labor. The baby wasn't due until next week. Williams caught a flight back to LA and arrived in plenty of time for the Tuesday afternoon birth of his first son. He also has two daughters. ""Lucky for us, we both have family in town,"" he said. ""A bunch of women taking care of things."" NO GRIFFIN Griffin sat out with left knee soreness against his former team. Clipper Darrell shouted, ""I paid my money and I want to see Blake Griffin!"", drawing a smile from Griffin seated on the bench. The crowd then began chanting, ""We want Blake! We want Blake!"" ""I have a lot of love for these fans,"" Griffin said. REMEMBERING STERN Rivers recalled that David Stern was the first call he received after being fired as Orlando coach in 2003. ""I'm thinking, `Wow, this is a cool thing. When you get fired the commissioner calls,"" Rivers said. ""But he was calling me to tell me was that tomorrow ABC was going to offer me the job and I better take it."" Rivers did, working with Al Michaels as a TV commentator for one season before returning to coaching with the Boston Celtics. ""He was the sheriff with love,"" Rivers said of Stern, who died Wednesday. ""People don't remember this league when he came in. This was a tough league. This was a drug-infested, image-problem league. David Stern came in and cleaned it up and kept it going."" Casey credited Stern for doing more than any other sports commissioner to promote race relations and women in the workplace. ""I am a product of the '60s and I've seen everything, discrimination, segregation, and David made it known from the very start that he wanted diversity in the NBA,"" Casey said. ""He wanted it in the front offices and in the coaching ranks, and he made it happen."" There was a pregame moment of silence for Stern.","401161158"
"BOSTON --  Daniel Theis had already seen Trae Young make five 3-pointers -- a few from more than 30 feet away -- so he could pretty much figure out what the Atlanta Hawks guard was thinking in the final seconds of a two-point game. ""As soon as I switched on him, I knew he wanted to take the 3 to win the game,"" the Celtics center said. ""He probably would've beat me for a layup, but I think he just wanted the game-winner. That's why I said I just tried to take away the shot, and at the end I was right there to block it."" Young had 28 points and 10 assists, but Theis blocked his step-back 3-point attempt with 3 seconds left and Boston recovered from an 18-point, first-quarter deficit against the NBA's worst team to win 109-106 on Friday night. ""That's a big-time basketball play,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""It sounds easy when we all sit here and talk about it, but in the throes of the game and knowing that Trae is capable of getting to the rim on anybody, that's a huge, huge play."" Jaylen Brown had 24 points and 10 rebounds for Boston. Marcus Smart started in place of the flu-ridden Kemba Walker and scored 15 points, adding nine assists and hitting a 3-pointer that gave Boston a four-point lead with 43 seconds left. And then he gloated about it to the Atlanta bench. ""I just told them to keep leaving me open,"" said Smart, who also grabbed the rebound after Young's last-second miss, got tripped up trying to step over Young's prone body and then got into a shoving match over it with Hawks center Alex Len. Smart and Alex Len were given matching technical fouls, then Smart made one of two free throws with 0.3 seconds left to ice the game. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said he wasn't surprised to see Smart taking the key shot. ""Marcus Smart is a playmaker and that's not out of the realm of what he does,"" said Pierce, who was an assistant coach on the U.S. team that included Smart at last summer's World Cup. ""That's actually what they're looking for. He's looking for the moment, they're looking for him and they expect him to make those type of plays."" Gordon Hayward scored 18, and Enes Kanter had 14 points and 11 rebounds for Boston, which has won seven of eight. EARLY LEADS The Hawks beat Orlando on Monday to snap a 10-game losing streak that left them with the worst record in the NBA. They opened a 29-11 lead against Boston in the first quarter, when John Collins had nine points and six rebounds. The Celtics erased almost all of it by halftime, scoring the last five points of the first quarter and the first six of the second before heading into the break trailing only 55-53. Hayward hit a 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter to give Boston an 82-80 lead. The Hawks never led again, though they had a half-dozen chances to do so in the final minutes. ""They came out playing fast. They came out playing aggressive. They came out playing free,"" Brown said. ""Shout-out to those guys. They probably deserved to win, but we pulled it out."" OUT OF ACTION Walker was ruled out in the morning with the flu. Collins left the game after colliding with Jayson Tatum trying to block his dunk. Both players were slow to get up, but Tatum remained in the game and Collins was ruled out with a back bruise. Hawks guard Vince Carter did not play. In his next game, he will become the first person in NBA history to play in four decades. Carter, who turns 43 this month, made his debut with Toronto in 1999. ""He and Tom Brady are in a race for years and years to come,"" Stevens, who is only three months older than Carter, said before the game.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Heat went cold in the fourth quarter Friday night, matching the lowest point total for a quarter by an NBA team in more than two years. Terrence Ross scored 25 points, Nikola Vucevic added 20 points and 11 rebounds and the Orlando Magic held Miami to six points over the final 12 minutes on their way to a 105-85 victory. ""They shut down the paint, they shut down our layups, shut down a lot of the things we're used to getting and shut down our normal threes,"" Miami coach Eric Spoelstra said. ""There was a possession when they must have run us off five straight 3s on their close-outs and did a tremendous job with making multiple efforts, and we weren't really doing that on the other end. They deserved to get that win."" Miami shot 3 for 19 from the field and missed all 10 3-point shots while committing six turnovers in the period.The last team team to score only six points in a quarter was Portland against Toronto in October 2017. Jimmy Butler had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat. Bam Adebayo, with 14 points and 10 rebounds, was the only other Miami player in double figures. Aaron Gordon had 16 points and eight rebounds for the Magic, and Evan Fournier scored 15 points despite spending most of the game in foul trouble.

Another 3-pointer by Gordon and a short jump hook by Vucevic pushed the margin to 18 points with 4:29 left. ""A lot of teams are going to circle us on their calendar,"" Meyers said, ""but of course Orlando -- this is an in-state rivalry or whatever you want to call it. You have to expect that . . . so it's simply understanding at this point that we definitely have a bit of a target on our back, and we have to raise our level of intensity and understand that every night it's going to be a battle."" The loss, only the second in eight games for the Heat, dropped them to 25-10 on the season. ""I thought our defense was good, I thought our purpose was good. Obviously that's a good win against a really good team,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. TIP-INS Heat: F Justise Winslow missed his 14th straight game with a lower back bruise. . . . It was the first of four meetings between the intrastate rivals this season and the 120th regular-season meeting. Miami leads the series 65-55.

""Now we've got to move forward."" Thomas was tied up along the sideline by Portland's Carmelo Anthony. As he broke away from Anthony he made contact with referee Marat Kogut, who stumbled. Thomas was throw out with 10:32 left in the opening quarter. ""He made physical contact with the referee,"" referee Mark Ayotte said in a pool report. ""It was definitely just a push during the dead ball contact with the referee."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks thought the contact was accidental. ""I mean I had a different view of it obviously,"" he said. ""They were in a scrum and they were fighting for the ball, a jump ball. I had a view that it looked like he lost his balance but (Kogut) had a better view and then they looked at it. They looked at it so you would hope they made the right call."" Thomas wasn't in the locker room after the game. ""I didn't really pay much attention to the contact and I was standing right there,"" Lillard said. ""I thought he just fell into him. And that was it. They reviewed it and they kind of stood their ground on it. So I guess what they thought happened, happened."" Thomas received a two-game suspension after walking into the stands to confront two fans following a timeout in Philadelphia on Dec. 21. Jordan McRae scored a season-high 35 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, for Washington. Garrison Mathews added 18 points and Ish Smith scored 16 for the Wizards, who have lost four of five. Playing without Bradley Beal, Washingon's top three scorers were reserves. Beal is day-to-day. He returned Wednesday against Orlando after missing two games with lower leg soreness and collided with the Magic's Jonathan Isaac early on. Brooks said the collision aggravated Beal's injury. McCollum started an 11-1 run in the third quarter with a jumper and then added a 3-pointer to make it 73-64. Whiteside scored four straight points on a tip-in and layup and, after a Washington free throw, Lillard hit two foul shots to put Portland up 79-65. McRae's 3-pointer pulled Washington within 103-96 with 5:54 left, but Lillard answered with five quick points to make it 108-96. ""We're a young team,"" McRae said. ""We're trying to figure out ways to win those games in the last five minutes of the game. You've got to get stops, you've got to be efficient on the offensive end."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Forward Mario Hezonja returned after missing four games because of lower back pain. . Lillard has scored at least 29 points in the teams' last six matchups. . Whiteside has 26 double-doubles Wizards: Have 20 20-plus point games from bench, second-most in the NBA behind the Clippers (31). . Wizards bench has 17 games of 50 or more combined points. .

WHITE OUT Whiteside recorded his first 20-point, 20-rebound game of the season as the team played its second game of 2020. ""He has a knack around the basket,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""As far as 20 rebounds, he goes after them. And he's got a lot of length. ... His scoring a lot of times, he's the beneficiary of passing but I thought he really went after some offensive rebounds and created some opportunities for himself.""","401161161"
"Mike D'Antoni is interrupted by a fire alarm and jokes that it went off because James Harden was on fire. (0:38) HOUSTON --  Houston Rockets coach Mike DAntoni is convinced James Harden operates on a different level than most players, especially after his latest dazzling performance. Harden had 44 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to lead the Rockets to a 118-108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night. He just understands the game, sees it and knows where he wants them, DAntoni said. They stay out, he throws a lob. They come in, he throws that. Hes got that little runner, his 3s are all over the place. I mean, hes really good. Hes one of the best ever. On a Flashback Friday night in which the Rockets wore their retro ketchup-and-mustard uniforms from their back-to-back NBA title days in the mid-90s, Harden sported a retro look of his own, with a white headband and cornrows. With Philadelphia threatening late, Harden knocked down a deep step-back 3-pointer over Josh Richardson with 1:17 left in the game that put Houston up 10. On the next possession, he found Clint Capela with an alley-oop for a thunderous dunk. Hardens triple-double was his first of the season and 43rd of his career, tying Fat Level for eighth-most in NBA history. Capela was a point shy of his career high in scoring, finishing with a season-best 30 points and 14 rebounds. You never feel comfortable, 76ers coach Brett Brown said. He dribbles two feet over half-court and you still dont feel like youre close enough. Then, you try to get close and hes strong enough and good enough to go by you, and then, Capela gets behind your head for the lobs. The package is lethal. Theyre hard to beat. The 76ers have lost four straight, their longest skid since dropping five in a row in Dec. 2017. Ben Simmons led Philadelphia with 29 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists and four blocks, which matched a career-high. It was his 25th career triple-double and third this season. Tobias Harris scored 24 points. We can never let the highs get too high or the lows get too low, Simmons said. Weve got to get better. After missing Philadelphias 115-97 loss with a sore left knee on Tuesday, Joel Embiid added 20 points and 12 rebounds. If its not taking a toll on anybody, I care about winning, and its taking a toll on me, Embiid said. All I care about is winning. ... Weve got to find a way. Weve got to keep fighting. Brown insisted that he is confident that his team will move on from the rough patch. You just keep moving, Brown said. Youve got to identify obvious things that you need to work on. We had a rough time shooting tonight. Keep the boys in the boat and good days will add up. The Rockets improved to 13-4 at home this season and have won their last four games at the Toyota Center. The 76ers led 27-20 after the first quarter, dominating the paint and keeping Houstons shooters in check. With less than five seconds remaining in the quarter, Harden was fouled by Trey Burke in the process of making a deep 3-pointer, but the shot was called off, infuriating Rockets coach Mike DAntoni, who argued with officials during the break. Early in the second quarter, Russell Westbrook received a technical foul for arguing a foul call against him after tangling with Embiid for a rebound. Houstons shooting improved after the first quarter, and the Rockets led 60-53 at halftime. Westbrook had a rough stretch in the third quarter during which he missed an open, two-handed dunk in transition and immediately followed the play with a missed layup. Westbrook finished the game shooting 9 of 22 from the field with 20 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Houston led 96-84 entering the fourth quarter. The Rockets have a lengthy four-day break before visiting Atlanta on Wednesday night, the start of a stretch in which they will play five games in seven days. TIP-INS 76ers: Trey Burke received a technical foul late in the second quarter for arguing a foul call he was charged with while guarding Eric Gordon. ... SF James Ennis III missed the game with a stomach illness. Rockets: In his third game back from a nearly seven-week absence with a knee injury, SG Eric Gordon scored 12 points on 3-of-13 shooting, including 2 of 10 from 3, in 30 minutes off the bench. ...

"PHOENIX --  Deandre Ayton snatched the loose ball, glanced down the court and saw Aron Baynes streaking toward the rim with no one around him. The 6-foot-11 center never hesitated, launching a pass to his 6-10 teammate and hitting him in stride for the easy bucket. ""I saw him running,"" Ayton said with a grin. ""And I was like, `Yeah, that's a done deal."" It was a crucial moment in a fourth-quarter rally for the Phoenix Suns, who recovered from a slow start to push past the New York Knicks 120-112 on Friday night. It was also proof that Ayton and Baynes -- two big men who started together for the first time all season -- can share the court and thrive. ""I think it's something we can grow, I do,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""It's putting your best players out there and your best athletes on the floor."" Baynes scored 20 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, while Ayton added 15 points, 13 boards and five assists. Devin Booker led all scorers with 38 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 29. Booker scored at least 30 points for a fifth straight game, the longest streak of his career and tying a franchise high. Oubre shot 11 of 16 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point range, and had 20 points in the second half. ""We just brought the fight to them,"" Oubre said. Ayton was playing in just his fifth game all season. The 2018 top overall draft pick missed 25 games because of a suspension and then missed a few more because of a sprained ankle shortly after his return. Now he's played three straight for the first time this season and the Suns have won two of the three. ""It's adjustments,"" Suns guard Ricky Rubio said. ""Baynes has been playing really well and we need (Ayton). So we try to find a way where both can play at the same time and share the court. It's going to be a good weapon for us."" Marcus Morris scored 25 points and Bobby Portis added 20 off the bench for the Knicks, who were trying to win four straight for the first time in more than two years. Julius Randle had 13 points and 13 rebounds. The Knicks led for a big chunk of the game, including 87-83 after three quarters, but the Suns rallied to take a 94-93 lead on Rubio's 3-pointer with about 8 minutes left. The teams traded the lead for the next few minutes, but the Suns pushed ahead for good on a short jumper by Baynes with 5:22 left. The Knicks couldn't keep pace, shooting 2 of 11 from 3-point range in the final quarter. ""We got good shots, honestly,"" Randle said. ""We scored enough points to win the game. We just couldn't get stops. We had a slow start in the third quarter and they were confident the rest of the way."" Coming off victories over Brooklyn, Washington and Portland, the Knicks got off to another good start and led 61-51 at halftime. Portis scored 11 points in the half and Randle had 10. Phoenix had another lethargic first half, two nights after falling behind by 33 points against the Lakers. Booker scored 17 points before the break but the Suns missed all nine of their 3-point attempts. TIP-INS Knicks: G Dennis Smith Jr. (left oblique strain) didn't play for a fourth straight game. ... New York had a 30-19 rebounding advantage in the first half. ... The Knicks fell to 10-25 this season. Suns: F Frank Kaminsky III (knee soreness) didn't play for a third straight game.

Oubre got a technical in the first half after throwing down a dunk and then directing a quick head nod toward Randle.","401161163"
"LOS ANGELES --  Anthony Davis isn't having any sympathy when it comes to facing his former team. The Lakers forward had 46 points and 13 rebounds as Los Angeles rolled to a 123-113 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. It was Davis' fifth 40-point game this season and second straight against the team he played seven seasons for after he was the top overall pick in 2012. ""I felt like we force-fed him much less in this game. I thought he got most of it in flow. Diverse attack, free throws, the 3-point line, transition, rolls to the basket, post,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""He just scored in every way that you can, so it was definitely a different feel than last game."" Davis said this felt more like a normal game compared to this season's first meeting, when he scored 41 points in a Nov. 27 win at New Orleans. ""The first game in New Orleans was definitely a lot more emotional, not only going against my former team but playing in that arena again,"" said Davis, who is tied for fifth in the league in scoring at 27.8 points per game. ""Tonight, I think my teammates just gave me great opportunities and put me in great positions to score the basketball. I don't think I did anything, especially I didn't prepare any differently. Just came out and played basketball."" Danny Green added 25 points and LeBron James had 17 points and 15 assists for the Lakers, who have won four straight following a season-high, four-game losing streak. ""I don't think he had one play where it looked stressed,"" James said of Davis. ""He was efficient from the outset, hitting his jumpers in the low post. Made all, what, 13 of his free throws. Just another great performance."" The Lakers led by as many as 24 during the third quarter as Davis scored 19 in the period. They were up 105-83 at the end of the third quarter but the Pelicans rallied in the fourth quarter to get within 116-109 with 2:25 remaining on Brandon Ingram's dunk. A 3-pointer by Green and Davis' jumper following a turnover ended any hopes of New Orleans drawing closer. ""We're familiar with him. He's a tough matchup,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said of Davis. ""I thought we did a good job of taking it to the basket. We scored 68 points in the paint and had only seven free throws."" Former Lakers Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram led New Orleans in their return to Staples Center. Ball scored a team-high 23 points and Ingram added 22 as the Pelicans had their four-game winning streak snapped. It is the first time in Ball's three seasons he has had back-to-back, 20-point games. ""My body feels good and my confidence is where it is supposed to be,"" Ball said. J.J. Redick's 3-pointer drew the Pelicans within 74-67 less than 2 minutes into the second half before Los Angeles went on a 26-9 run to take its largest lead of the game. Davis had 17 points during the spurt, including three 3-pointers. Green had 17 points in the first quarter, including five 3-pointers as the Lakers led by 18 late in the quarter. Los Angeles was up 64-51 when New Orleans ran off nine straight points to get within 64-60 with 1:50 remaining in the first half. The Lakers would outscore the Pelicans 10-2 down the stretch, including seven by Davis, to lead 74-62 at halftime. ""They're a really good team. Anthony is a matchup problem for a lot of teams,"" Ingram said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Ingram, Ball and Josh Hart were welcomed back with a video during the first timeout. ...

"Montrezl Harrell hints at a problem in the Clippers' locker room while Kawhi Leonard comments on the team's poor communication and energy on the floor. (0:59) LOS ANGELES --  Jae Crowder was making shots early, putting him in a rhythm that carried throughout the game. His Memphis teammates followed right along and took advantage of Los Angeles star Paul George's absence to rout the Clippers 140-114 on Saturday. The Grizzlies never scored less than 25 points in each quarter. We controlled the tempo and got off to a big first quarter and scored 40 points, said Crowder, who scored 27 points. We've had big leads this year and lost them, so we stayed aggressive and continued to contest the rim. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 points, and Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks had 22 points each to help Memphis improve to 7-10 on the road with its highest scoring game of the season. We started off great, got stops when we needed them and nearly played a complete 48 minutes, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We're going to enjoy this one. The guys were (mad) how we let a big lead get away in Sacramento the other night and ended up losing that game. "" Montrezl Harrell led the Clippers with 28 points. Kawhi Leonard and Lou Williams added 24 points each. The team appeared out of sorts from the start without George. He sat out with left hamstring tightness and Los Angeles clearly missed his defense. The usually stoic Leonard complained to the referees, who hit him with a technical after the halftime buzzer. Coach Doc Rivers stayed on court discussing it and was unhappy about other calls in the game. I thought he had gotten fouled a couple times, Rivers said about non-calls on Leonard. The team with the most energy gets all the calls. We were complaining and they were running through us and playing hard. The Grizzlies raced to an 18-point lead to open the game, highlighted by a 16-2 run that included four 3-pointers -- three coming on consecutive possessions. We showed up and thought we were going to win, Rivers said. There are no excuses for the way we played. By the time Williams made the Clippers' first 3-pointer late in the second, cutting their deficit to seven, the Grizzlies had already connected on 10 3s. Los Angeles never got closer. It's just unacceptable, Williams said. We gave them a lot of confidence early and it went on for four quarters. We did get our (rear) kicked. Crowder scored 14 points in the third, making two late 3-pointers that helped extend the Grizzlies' lead to 104-80 going into the fourth. Crowder tied career highs with six 3-pointers and seven assists. The Clippers made a brief run in the fourth behind Harrell and Williams, using 10 straight points to close to 110-94. But Jackson took over from there, scoring 12 points down the stretch. We're confident we can build from this win and continue to get better, Jackson said. The Clippers' two-game winning streak ended. They haven't won three in a row since Dec. 9-13. We've been playing like this the last four, five games. The last good game we played was against the Lakers, Rivers said. We got to play better. TIP-INS Grizzlies: They've had four straight games with at least 30 assists, setting a franchise record. It was their 14th game with that many assists, setting a single-season franchise mark. ... They are 6-5 on the road against the West. Clippers: It's possible George could return Sunday against the Knicks in another day game. ... Patrick Beverley missed his third straight game with a sprained right wrist, but is close to being back. ... Leonard sat out the teams' first meeting Nov. 27, a two-point road win for the Clippers. FUTURE STAR Morant leads the league in rookie scoring and assists, and he's got a shot at setting the Grizzlies franchise rookie record for scoring average and assists. I'm not worried about the All-Star Game or being the rookie of the year, he said. ""My main goal is to stay humble and remain focused."" Morant's play hasn't surprised Jackson. I think he's exceeded everyone else's expectations, Jackson said. ""He's a special talent. He moves without the ball, gets back on defense, set screens and gets the ball to guys when they're open."" HE SAID IT I just don't want us to think we're good enough yet because we're not."" -- Rivers. NIGHTTIME IS THE RIGHT TIME Rivers says he hates day games. The Clippers have seven more 12:30 p.m. starts this season, but none occur back-to-back like this weekend. It disrupts your whole day, especially if you're the home team. You don't eat lunch at the same time and it makes everything inconsistent, he said. ""I much prefer to play at night and I believe all of the players do as well.""","401161165"
"NEW YORK --  The Toronto Raptors were coming off their most inept performance of the season and their shooting looked just as off to start their game Saturday night. ""It don't matter. We're going to keep putting them up,"" Kyle Lowry said. ""That's what we we do. We believe in the work that we put in."" Especially when they play the Brooklyn Nets. Fred VanVleet had 29 points and 11 assists, Lowry scored 26 points and the Raptors bounced back from their worst offensive performance of the season to beat the slumping Nets 121-102. Serge Ibaka finished with 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Raptors. They were held to season lows for points and shooting in their 84-76 loss in Miami, when they hit just 31.5% overall and went 6 for 42 from 3-point range (14.3%.) ""We know that Miami game is a game that ain't going to happen much,"" Lowry said. ""Just got to keep playing."" They started slowly in this one but got back into it with a big finish to the first half before their guards -- who both hit five 3-pointers -- carried them in the second half for another win in what's been a one-sided rivalry. ""I think both those guys really had good floor games as well,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""There was a lot of silliness, it seemed like for us, falling over or kicking the ball around first 15 minutes of the game and then after that we looked really, really well organized."" Toronto made 13 3s and beat Brooklyn for the 17th time in 18 meetings. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 23 points for the Nets, who dropped their fifth straight. They had a 16-point lead in the second quarter but gave almost all of it away by halftime. ""They forced us into 24 turnovers. That's what they do,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We couldn't handle their pressure. We could not handle their swarming defense."" Caris LeVert returned after a 24-game absence following right thumb surgery and scored 13 points in 16 minutes off the bench. The Nets shot 61% in the first quarter and were 6 of 10 from 3-point range to open a 33-24 lead. They were controlling the play in the second, pushing the lead to 52-36 on Taurean Prince's 3-pointer before a sloppy finish to the period. Toronto scored the final 12 points to trim it to 52-48. Brooklyn had 16 turnovers in the half, leading to 20 points. VanVleet then scored 14 in the third to keep Toronto ahead until it went into the fourth leading 83-80. Lowry's 3-pointer with 9:08 to play triggered a 15-5 spurt that turned a two-point lead into a 100-88 cushion midway through the period. They blew it open for good later in the fourth. ""When teams take it to another level, we've got to be able to do the same thing,"" LeVert said. ""We've got to do it first, be the aggressor in that situation."" TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse predicted that the order of return for his injured players would be Matt Thomas (broken finger), Norman Powell (left shoulder), Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and Piascal Siakam (groin). They were hurt in mid-December. ... Ibaka had his fifth straight double-double. ... There was a video tribute for Rondae Hollis-Jefferson after the first quarter.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Donovan Mitchell carrying Utah late in a game was no surprise, but having Georges Niang shoulder some of the load certainly was as the Jazz duo combined to take down the Orlando Magic 109-96 on Saturday night. Mitchell scored 10 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter when Utah broke open a close game with a flurry of 3-pointers, including three straight from Niang that gave the Jazz enough breathing room to coast to their fifth straight win. Niang finished with 15 points in 16 minutes. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 14, Emmanuel Mudiay added 12 and Joe Ingles had 11 for the Jazz, who made eight 3s in the fourth quarter. ""This is a group that enjoys when someone else steps up,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""That's unique. Nobody's thinking about their game, their line -- it's our game. I don't think there is anybody on our team that doesn't want someone to shoot as long as they're good shots. If you're open -- and you can shoot -- it's a good shot, especially if they're going in."" Niang's hot streak actually started at the end of the third quarter when he and Mitchell hit a pair of 3s to hold off a surge by Orlando. However, after Mitchell started the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer, Niang nailed three straight from behind the arc and the Jazz were on their way. ""I was going to my normal spots and once I hit a couple, guys really started looking for me,"" Niang said. ""Once you're in a zone, you kind of just stick to it."" The shots never really fell for the Magic, who scrambled back from an early deficit to take a 75-74 lead late in the third quarter behind 3-point shooting from Terrence Ross, but couldn't find a hot hand to carry them in the fourth quarter. Ross led Orlando with 24 points, Nikola Vucevic had 22 points and 11 rebounds, and Aaron Gordon added 11 points and 12 rebounds. The Magic made only 29.7% (11 of 37) of their 3-point attempts. ""We needed to shoot the ball better,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We got a little tired, but the biggest thing was at the beginning of the fourth. You can't be disorganized in this league and they are so well-coached they took us apart."" Utah led 76-75 going into the final period and then hit eight of 13 shots from behind the arc, including its first five field goals of the quarter to break open a close game. The teams combined to shoot just 22.8% (8 of 35) from behind the 3-point line in the first half, but players on both sides began hitting late in the third quarter. D.J. Augustin started a rapid-fire sequence of 3s with a shot from the corner that tied it at 68 with 2:20 left in the third. Ross followed with a four-point play, but Utah was just getting warmed up. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell had 30 points the first time the teams met this season. . C Rudy Gobert is shooting 66.7% (37 of 54) in his last six games. . G Jordan Clarkson, who averaged 15 points in his first four games with the Jazz after being traded from Cleveland, had seven against Orlando. Utah is 5-0 in those games.

"ATLANTA --  Even when producing the most first-half points of his career, Trae Young didn't carry the load alone for the Atlanta Hawks. Young's backcourt partner, Kevin Huerter, also enjoyed a memorable night. Young scored 30 of his 41 points in the first half, Huerter added a season-high 26 points and the Hawks recovered after blowing a 22-point lead to beat the Indiana Pacers 116-111 on Saturday night. Huerter scored 12 points in the third quarter, helping Atlanta keep pace in a game with 14 lead changes. ""We had a couple guys out again tonight and a couple guys just weren't shooting very well,"" Huerter said. ""I was just trying to stay aggressive. I knew I made a couple shots and was feeling pretty good. We ran a lot of sets for me."" Young and Huerter combined to make nine 3-point shots. The Hawks, who have the NBA's worst record, improved to only 4-12 in home games. The Hawks started strong offensively, scoring 43 points in the first quarter. Defensive problems have helped keep Atlanta at the bottom of the NBA standings, but the Hawks gave up only 16 points in the fourth quarter to take the win. ""We didn't start the game right,"" said Indiana's Jeremy Lamb, who had 12 points. ""Down the stretch we didn't put the ball in the hole."" Atlanta led by just two points before Young's drive and layup pushed the lead to 113-109. Young, defended by T.J. Warren, lost possession of his dribble out of bounds with 24.8 seconds remaining. A review confirmed the officials' call that possession belonged to the Hawks, but Vince Carter's air ball with the shot clock on the verge of expiring gave the Pacers another chance. Warren made only one of two free throws after he was fouled with 4.5 seconds remaining. Young made just the second of his two free throws for a 114-111 lead, but was fouled again and this time sank both attempts to clinch the win. Domantas Sabonis had 25 points and 11 rebounds for Indiana. Justin Holiday had 18 points. ""If we had a better start maybe the outcome would have been different,"" Holiday said. The Hawks opened with their highest-scoring first quarter of the season, leading 43-23. Atlanta's big lead was 22 points. Young had 18 points in the period. The Pacers took their first lead at 68-66 early in the second half on a four-point play by Warren, who made a 3-pointer and a free throw after he was fouled by Bruno Fernando. After a long succession of lead changes, Warren sank another 3 for an 88-85 lead. The advantage held until Huerter's 3 gave Atlanta a 96-95 lead entering the final period. TIP-INS Pacers: Warren had 17 points. ... G T.J. McConnell was escorted to the locker room after turning his right ankle in the fourth quarter. In obvious pain, McConnell threw the ball while seated on the floor and received a technical foul. ... For the eighth straight game, Indiana was outrebounded, this time 40-39. ... Indiana's seven-game winning streak against Atlanta was snapped. ... Malcolm Brogdon did not travel with the team due to a sore back. ...

The last Hawks player to have at least 30 points in any half was Joe Johnson, who had 30 in the second half at New Jersey on Nov. 14, 2008. FOUR DECADES FOR CARTER Carter, who did not play in Atlanta's loss at Boston on Friday night, entered the game in the first quarter to become the first player in NBA history to play in four decades. Carter was a rookie with Toronto in the 1998-99 season. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said it is difficult to understand Carter has been teammates with Hakeem Olajuwon and Young at the bookends of his career. ""I don't know how to put into words that's he's played in four different decades,"" Pierce said..","401161168"
"CLEVELAND --  Kevin Love has been the subject of trade speculation all season, and the Cleveland Cavaliers star showed his frustration several times during Saturday night's 121-106 loss to Oklahoma City. Dennis Schroder scored 22 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 20 as the Thunder rolled to their fifth straight victory. Earlier in the day, Love yelled at Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman over a recent fine, according to a report by The Athletic. Citing anonymous sources, The Athletic said the incident took place following the team's shootaround and Love was screaming in front of teammates, coaches and front office staff. Love became annoyed late in the second quarter when Collin Sexton didn't throw him the ball as he was getting position in the lane. The veteran forward threw his arms in the air and slowly walked toward Sexton at the top of the key. After receiving the ball, Love threw a low pass to Cedi Osman, who bobbled the ball before shooting a 3-pointer. ""We were making a play call,"" Love said. ""We were in the bonus and Chris Paul was on me, so I felt swing it to me and try to throw it in the post, see if they double team and get a good shot out of that. That's not what we did, and yeah, I was frustrated."" Cavaliers coach John Beilein took blame for the play call as the clock was winding down, but doesn't want his players to show frustration on the court. ""If I do it, if anyone does it, it really doesn't make you a better player or a better coach at that time,"" Beilein said. ""It's like carrying a suitcase around with you, that you have extra baggage. We don't need to do that. ... So as it's pointed out to me or I see it, we try to address it the best we can."" The report in The Athletic said Love was fined for $1,000 for his outburst on the bench during Tuesday's game in Toronto, where he pounded a chair in frustration as he came off the court during a timeout. Love's name has come up in trade talks as the rebuilding Cavaliers are looking to the future. He's in the second season of a four-year, $120 million contract extension. Danilo Gallinari added 19 points, hitting five 3-pointers, and Steven Adams grabbed 16 rebounds for the Thunder. ""The ability and talent of Chris, Shai and Dennis was the difference,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""They have the ability to get around -- and through -- coverage. They can find a way to get downhill and find a way to the basket."" Oklahoma City went ahead late in the first quarter and steadily built the lead. The Thunder led 91-74 before Cleveland got within nine early in the fourth, but Oklahoma City pulled away. Sexton scored 30 points for the Cavaliers, who have lost three straight. TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City lost its first six road games, but is 8-3 away from home since. ... C Nerlens Noel limped to the locker room after stepping on the foot of a Cavaliers player in the third quarter. He was diagnosed with a sprained left ankle and didn't return. Cavaliers: Cleveland played without top bench players Larry Nance Jr. and Kevin Porter Jr. Nance could be out for two weeks because of a sore left knee, while Porter missed the game for personal reasons. The team expects Porter to return Sunday against Minnesota. ... Rookie guard Dylan Windler, who hasn't played this season because of a stress reaction in his left leg, is participating in 3-on-3 drills. MEMORIES Beilein was coaching West Virginia when the Mountaineers defeated Paul and Wake Forest in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on March 19, 2005, in a game played at Cleveland State. West Virginia won 111-105 in double overtime despite Paul scoring 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists before fouling out. ""His last college game was right down the street,"" Beilein said. ""I remember him well. Now it's 15 years later and in the NBA, he's terrific."" Paul, 34, is enjoying his first season with the Thunder. ""The guys on the team just tell me I'm old, but I feel damn good, so I'm cool,"" he said. ""I always try to stay in the moment, but I feel like I keep good perspective.""","401161169"
"WASHINGTON --  The short-handed Washington Wizards took down one of the NBAs top teams thanks to their reserves for the second time in a week. Ish Smith scored a career-high 32 points and Troy Brown added 25 and a career-high 14 rebounds in the Wizards' 128-114 victory over the Denver on Nuggets on Saturday night. Smith and Brown came off the bench to lead the Wizards. They followed up Mondays big win over the Miami Heat by knocking off one of the best teams from the West. After Denver took a 101-99 lead with 9:33 left on Mason Plumlee's dunk, the Wizards scored the next 11 with the run eventually reaching 19-2 for a 118-103 lead with 4:48 remaining. Smith scored 11 points in that stretch, capping the surge with a 3-pointer and ended with 13 in the fourth quarter. ""It was ridiculous, Brown said about Smiths play in the fourth. Literally, it was like, ""Give Ish the ball and get out of the way.'"" Jamal Murray scored all 39 of his points after the first quarter for Denver, and Nikola Jokic had with 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Nuggets have lost two of three on their five-game trip. They shot 6 of 29 on 3-pointers. ""We didn't show up, said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. That was embarrassing. That was an embarrassing performance. We had a mindset that we're just going to show up and win the game maybe because some of their starters were (out). ... We got our ass kicked tonight."" Washington played its second straight game without scoring leader Bradley Beal. The two-time All-star remains day-to-day. He returned Wednesday against Orlando after missing two games with lower leg soreness, but sat out Friday night against Portland after re-aggravating the injury. In all, Washington is currently without its top four scorers which doesnt include John Wall who has missed the entire season. Isaac Bonga had 15 points and Anzejs Pasecniks added 13 to give the Wizards four double-digit scorers off the bench As Malone walked away from his post game remarks he turned back for one final comment: ""Sorry you had to watch that."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Inactive 7-foot-2 rookie center Bol Bol (left foot injury management) made his first trip to Washington as an NBA player. His late father, 7-foot-7 center Manute Bol, started his 10-year NBA career with the Washington Bullets in 1985.  Retired and well-traveled NBA guard Andre Miller attended the game involving two of his former nine teams. The Nuggets traded Miller to the Wizards during the 2013-14 season. Wizards: Jonathan Williams started and scored 12 points but was released following the win. Washington signed Williams on Dec. 26 to a non-guaranteed contract. All such deals become guaranteed by Jan. 10..Wizards point guard Isaiah Thomas started and scored nine points in 17 minutes after being fined $25,000 earlier in the day. Thomas lasted less than two minutes Friday after making inappropriate contact with a game official.  Smith and Brown gave the Wizards their 21st and 22nd 20-plus point game from the bench, second behind only the Clippers.  The Wizards split with Denver for the third straight season. ISH Smith said he was frustrated the last two games with missing his usually trusty mid-range shots and ""we got into some scoring lulls."" He entered Saturday focused on finding a rhythm for himself and the offense. ""Those shots fell for me tonight,"" said Smith, who sank 15 of 24 attempts overall. ""We got a really good win against a really good team.""","401161170"
"CHICAGO --  Out of sync the previous night, Jayson Tatum sure was locked in this time. Tatum scored 28 points, Gordon Hayward added 24 and the Boston Celtics beat the Chicago Bulls 111-104 on Saturday. The Celtics hung on for their eighth win in nine games after a 16-point lead dwindled to three in the fourth quarter. Tatum hit a long 3-pointer with just over a minute left to bump the lead to seven, and the Atlantic Division leaders came out on top after rallying from 18 down to beat Atlanta on Friday. Tatum went hard at the rim right from the start and hit 12 of 15 shots following a 2-of-16 performance against the Hawks. ""That's the good thing about this league,"" he said. ""If you play good or play bad, you need to forget about the last one."" Jaylen Brown scored 19 for the Celtics, and Enes Kanter had 17 points and 12 rebounds. Boston overcame 20 turnovers to win again even though flu-ridden star Kemba Walker missed his second straight game. Zach LaVine scored 35 to lead Chicago and nailed five 3-pointers. Lauri Markkanen had 15 points, though he walked gingerly off the court with about four minutes left after a driving Marcus Smart landed on his left ankle. The Bulls lost for the fourth time in five games. The Celtics led 93-77 early in the fourth. But instead of cruising the rest of the way, they had to withstand a big push by Chicago. LATE RALLY The Bulls cut it to 95-92 with 7:21 remaining on a 3 by LaVine and a layup by Kris Dunn. It stayed tight until Tatum nailed a 3 from the right side with Dunn giving him little room to make it 108-101 with 1:06 left. LaVine then missed two free throws and a pull-up 3, helping seal the win for Boston. ""He made a lot of great plays,"" Dunn said. ""A lot of great plays. Even the 3 toward the end, I thought I had good defense, good hands, but he was so far out, he was almost out of bounds, but he knocked it down."" Celtics coach Brad Stevens noticed a more aggressive Tatum, right from the start. ""I thought today, when he caught it, he didn't dance in the first half,"" Stevens said. ""He caught it on the run and drove it to the rim and made a number of good plays. Got some finishes to go. Felt a little better about himself probably and then at the end made an incredible shot. That was really tough."" SHORTENED ROTATION Chicago used just eight players rather than the usual 10 or 11 after coach Jim Boylen said before the game he wouldn't change his approach with the Celtics playing their second game in two nights. ""They have three 6-8 guys that handle the ball,"" he said, referring to the 6-foot-6 Brown, 6-7 Hayward and 6-8 Tatum. ""It's a good team to give it a look."" TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said Walker is improving, though he would have to feel ""much better"" Sunday to meet the team in Washington. Stevens said that remained a possibility. ... Stevens said scans on C Robert Williams (left hip bone edema) showed improvement and he will meet Tuesday with a specialist. Williams has not played since Dec. 6. ... Kanter had to get his chin stitched following Friday's win over Atlanta. ""He was bragging about his scar,"" Stevens said. Bulls: F Chandler Hutchison (right shoulder) missed his 17th consecutive game, after playing for the G League's Windy City Bulls on Friday. He has not appeared in a game for Chicago since Nov. 27.","401161171"
"DALLAS --  Miles Bridges flexed his muscles at the crowd when Luka Doncic's potential winning 3-pointer over him bounced off the rim at the end of the fourth quarter. Then the Charlotte forward escaped trouble in overtime with a pass to wide-open Terry Rozier for a 3 that put the Hornets up for good. Rozier scored 29 points, including the go-ahead shot from long range in the extra period after his tying basket in regulation, and the Hornets beat Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks 123-120 on Saturday night. Devonte Graham had 27 points and 13 assists as the Hornets erased a 12-point deficit in the fourth quarter after leading by 20 in the first half of their second straight win after a season-worst six-game losing streak. ""We just stayed resilient,"" said Bridges, who had 11 points and 11 rebounds. ""We could have given up when they went up by 12. We didn't give up. We needed that win."" Doncic set a Dallas season record with his NBA-leading 10th triple-double, scoring 39 points with 12 rebounds and 10 assists. But the 2019 Rookie of the Year had a turnover and two missed 3s late in regulation. ""We should have won it in the fourth quarter,"" said Doncic, who had just two points in overtime after scoring 10 each in the third and fourth quarters. ""I messed it up. I didn't make great decisions. Terrible decisions."" Maxi Kleber scored a career-high 24 points after getting his season high of 18 in the previous game for Dallas. Kleber hit a tying 3 with 1:02 remaining in overtime to top his previous career best of 21. But Rozier, who was 10 of 15 overall and 5 of 8 from long range, answered with a 3-pointer at the other end on a pass from Bridges for a 117-114 lead. ""I give our group a lot of credit to come out and get up whatever it was, double digits early, play with poise, play with urgency, play with force,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""And then to lose that lead, how do we respond? That's all we talked about in the timeout, how are we going to respond?"" The Hornets scored the final six points of regulation to force overtime. After a turnover by Doncic, P.J. Washington drove for a dunk and Rozier hit a leaning layup for a 103-all tie with 19 seconds left after Doncic missed a 3 at the other end. Dallas tried Doncic again at the end of regulation, but his 3 over Bridges missed, and Bridges celebrated with his silent flex as he went to the bench. Washington scored 19 points on 9-of-12 shooting, and Bismack Biyombo had 11 points and 13 rebounds. J.J. Barea had 11 points and nine assists in his second straight start -- and first two of the season -- with shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr. sidelined for a third consecutive games by a left hamstring strain. Kristaps Porzingis has been out the same three games with right knee soreness. BACKING DONCIC Dallas coach Rick Carlisle sounded off before the game on what he believes is intentionally rough play by opponents against Doncic. ""It's been going on the entire season,"" Carlisle said. ""Teams are taking liberties on him. It's not good. But he's handling it very well."" Carlisle said he talks to game officials when he thinks it's happening in a game, but wouldn't specifically say he has brought it up with NBA officials. ""He's a great player so people are going to go after him,"" Carlisle said. ""It doesn't mean that a lot of this stuff is right or in the spirit of what the game should look like. He's got scratches all over his arms all the time, stuff like that. Not good."" Doncic said he wasn't surprised Carlisle spoke up for him. ""It's true. I'm not going to lie,"" he said. ""But it's just basketball. It's a physical game. I've just got to keep going."" TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte had five offensive rebounds on one possession and still didn't score. Cody Zeller missed the first layup, and the subsequent tip, before Bridges missed three straight tip attempts. Malik Monk got the fifth straight rebound and took the ball out before getting called for a charge while trying to drive for a bucket. Mavericks: It was the 20th anniversary of owner Mark Cuban's purchase of the team. He was given a standing ovation after a video tribute in the first half. ... Dwight Powell fouled out in the final minute of overtime with 11 points and seven rebounds. ... Dorian Finney-Smith had 15 points and eight rebounds.","401161172"
"MILWAUKEE --  San Antonio kept Giannis Antetokounmpo under control for one half. Then the third quarter started. The Milwaukee star opened it with a layup on an aggressive move to the basket and scored 19 of his game-high 32 points in the quarter, pacing the Bucks to a 127-118 victory over the Spurs on Saturday night. Antetokounmpo repeatedly was fouled on his drives to the hoop and converted all 12 of his free throw attempts in the second half, including 10 in the third quarter as the Bucks started to pull away. A 60% foul shooter this season entering the game, he finished 15 of 18 at the foul line to set a season-high for free throws made. ""That's how Giannis is built,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It felt like they were going to foul him every time he drove it and test him at the free throw line. If they're going to put him on the free throw line, I think Giannis will make them pay for it."" All the hard knocks failed to get Antetokounmpo off his game. ""I'm going to trust my technique,"" said Antetokounmpo, who had just nine points in the first half. ""I saw that whenever I was getting in the paint, they tried to reach and foul and push me and all that. I said, `OK, tonight is going to be the night.' I tried to drive it, go in the paint and just make a play for myself or for my teammate."" The NBA-leading Milwaukee improved to 32-5, winning their fifth straight since a Christmas Day loss in Philadelphia. Eric Bledsoe added 21 points and six assists, Khris Middleton had 20 points and Brook Lopez tied a season-high with seven blocks. Backup center Robin Lopez contributed 14 points and one block in 19 minutes. ""I thought we did a really good job in the first half, but he (Antetokounmpo) got away from us,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""It's a hell of a team. Those brothers killed us with the blocks and we were fouling too much."" San Antonio took a 12-point lead early in the game but trailed at the break, 71-66. LaMarcus Aldridge had all 16 of his points in the first half but was 0 for 7 from the field in 15 second-half minutes. DeMar DeRozan led the Spurs with 26 points and Rudy Gay had 15 off the bench. ""That's been our issue all year, having lapses whether it's the second quarter or the start of the second half,"" DeRozan said. ""It makes it tough on us to crawl back. ""We've got an opportunity to play these guys on our floor Monday. We know what we did wrong and just try to be better."" Bledsoe was 4 of 6 from 3-point range and Kyle Korver, Middleton and Antetokounmpo each added 3 triples as the Bucks went 17 of 45 (37.8%) from beyond the arc. The Bucks, who own the NBA's best record, will open a four-game Western swing in San Antonio on Monday, before moving on to play Golden State, Sacramento and Portland. Milwaukee improved to 18-2 at home and 23-0 against sub-500 teams. The Bucks also scored 100 or more points for the 61st consecutive game, tying a mark set by the Houston Rockets during the 2016-'17 season. TIP-INS Spurs: Derrick White moved into the starting lineup in the absence of fourth-year guard Dejounte Murray, who was out due to personal reasons. White has juggled roles, making his 11th start while coming off the bench in 21 other appearances. ""I think he's done it well. It's a pain in the rear to do that,"" Popovich said. White had nine points in 23 minutes. ... Lonnie Walker made his first NBA start, replacing Bryn Forbes in the starting lineup, and finished with eight points on 3-of-12 shooting. . Popovich was asked about Shaquille O'Neal's comment that he sees himself when he watches Antetokounmpo. ""I don't remember Shaq bringing the ball upcourt,"" Popovich said with a wry smile. ""Maybe I didn't pay attention. I don't know. His force on the game is like Giannis', that's for sure. But I think they had a little bit different game."" Bucks: Second-year guard Donte DiVincenzo sat out due to rest, a decision Budenholzer made with a long-term view. ""With the wings and the depth (the Bucks have), it's just a great opportunity to keep Donte healthy,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's playing so good for us. He's having such a big impact on games and maybe it's just trying to be aggressive, trying to be ahead of the curve. He probably thinks I'm insane."" DiVincenzo played in only 27 games as a rookie due to a right heel injury but has not had any problems with the foot this season. . Bucks veteran guard George Hill started his NBA career in 2008 with the Spurs and played three seasons under Popovich. ""He was always a hard worker; he always had a smile on his face,"" Popovich said. ""He did whatever we needed to have done on the court."" Hill was traded to Indiana in 2011 in the deal that brought Kawhi Leonard to San Antonio.","401161173"
"Andre Drummond isn't concerned about the recent trade rumors that have been surrounding his name, emphasizing that they happen every year. (0:24) SAN FRANCISCO --  In search of better starts after halftime, Detroit coach Dwane Casey turned to Derrick Rose to direct the offense starting out the third quarter. That veteran presence made quite a difference for the Pistons the rest of the way. Andre Drummond had 14 points and 18 rebounds before fouling out late, Rose scored 22 points off the bench, and the Pistons beat the Golden State Warriors 111-104 on Saturday night to snap a three-game losing streak. Casey had lost his voice afterward. Too much yelling? ""A little bit,"" he said with a grin. Detroit's effort on both ends was certainly a positive. ""I thought our defense was much better tonight,"" Casey said. ""Just the overall intensity and the hard play. I thought our disposition from losing three games in a row to some good teams, everyone bounced back and did a good job."" Reserve guard Alec Burks contributed 27 points, seven rebounds and five assists in Golden State's fourth straight defeat following a four-game winning streak. Draymond Green was ejected with 4:57 left in the third with back-to-back technicals. The Warriors had pulled within 73-68 but Detroit responded with a 9-1 burst and led 83-80 going into the fourth. ""The last couple games he's looked tired,"" coach Steve Kerr said of Green. ""I think you've got to remember that he's the lone the guy, lone holdover from the group that's been to the finals five years in a row. He looks tired to me. I've been trying to give him a night off here and there. We probably need to do that. I think he's just kind of worn out emotionally and physically."" Rose shot 10 for 16 to help the Pistons finish 51.8% from the floor. They played the first game of a Northern California-Southern California back-to-back and ended a four-game road skid with just their second victory in 10 games. Drummond said after the game he is unconcerned about trade speculation, noting: ""I have no problems here, I love it here. I can't control that aspect of the situation that I'm in right now."" After nine players scored in double figures in a 126-112 loss at the Clippers on Thursday, five players did so in this game. Golden State's Glenn Robinson III, who played for the Pistons last season, missed his first 10 shots before finally making his first and only basket with 3:03 left. EAGER SPLASH BROTHERS Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson have done a tremendous job cheerleading while sidelined by injuries. They're getting antsy to do far more. Curry has been cleared to travel though Kerr doesn't require it for injured players. Both are on schedule with their respective rehab programs. Curry has a broken left hand while Thompson is recovering from surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee suffered during the deciding Game 6 of the NBA Finals. ""They're definitely restless. They've been restless this whole season,"" Kerr said. ""I think they have also benefited from the break. The five-year run for those two guys in particular was exhausting, so in an ironic way this has been probably a good chance for them to blow off some steam and to whatever metaphor you want to use, cool their engines. But that can only last for so long. They're both dying to play, and we're dying to have them back."" MORE INJURED WARRIORS D'Angelo Russell missed a third straight game because of an inflamed right shoulder but is expected back for Monday's game at Sacramento. Kevon Looney, who is dealing with left abdominal soreness in his latest setback during an injury-plagued season, could be playing again next week if all goes well. He has been limited to just 10 games so far. ""It's just been a frustrating time, frustrating season for him,"" Kerr said. ZAZA'S REUNION Former Warriors center Zaza Pachulia, now a consultant for the team in the basketball operations department, spent last season with the Pistons before retiring as a player.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  JJ Redick spends plenty of time practicing left-handed drives to the hoop, just for moments like this one. His layup with 1.1 seconds remaining lifted the New Orleans Pelicans to a hard-fought 117-115 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night. Lonzo Ball had 24 points with 10 assists and Redick scored 18 as the Pelicans won for the fifth time in six games. Just moments earlier, it seemed New Orleans (12-24) had a win safely tucked away. But Sacramento's Nemanja Bjelica converted a four-point play with 4.2 seconds left to tie it at 115. Coming out of a timeout, Ball inbounded to Redick, who drove left and beat Richaun Holmes for a layup that banked in softly off the glass. ""Richaun saw him and you try to get (Redick) off the 3-point line because that's what he does,"" Sacramento guard De'Aaron Fox said. ""But he made a tough, underhand, left-hand layup that was high off the glass. Yes, that's a tough shot. But he's a veteran and he knocked it down."" Redick did so thanks to the early-morning work he puts in before Pelicans shootarounds, driving in for layups with his off hand while coaches swat at his shots with a big pad. ""Once I got by (Holmes), my mindset was just get the ball high off the glass,"" Redick said. ""Believe it or not, I practice that shot. And so when I shot it, I knew it was in."" Harrison Barnes matched a season high with 30 points to lead the Kings (13-23), and Buddy Hield added 24. The Pelicans, who recently stumbled through a 13-game losing streak, appear to be rounding into form as they await the return of No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson from a right knee injury. Williamson, who underwent surgery Oct. 21, has missed the entire season to this point, but he recently began practicing. ""To me, the big thing was our guys kept their poise and found a way to win a game on the road when everything that could go wrong had gone wrong,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. New Orleans trailed by four entering the fourth quarter, but Ball scored 15 points in the final period. It was his third consecutive game of 20-plus points after he had just one over his first 25 contests. New Orleans went into halftime with a 52-48 advantage thanks to 16 points from Redick, whose only points in the second half came on his game-winner. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans played its seventh set of back-to-back games this season. The Pelicans are 5-2 on the back end of such matchups. Kings: G Bogdan Bogdanovich, who aggravated an ankle injury Thursday, remained home with flu-like symptoms. Sacramento is 0-6 when he doesn't play. BJELICA'S MAGIC Sacramento trailed 115-111 with time winding down when Bjelica, double-teamed beyond the arc, banked in a 3-pointer and was fouled by Brandon Ingram with 4.2 seconds left. Bjelica hit the free throw to tie it and temporarily throw the home crowd into euphoria. PROTEST OVER IRAN Before the game, roughly 100 people gathered outside Golden 1 Center to protest the United States' recent airstrike in the Middle East that killed one of Iran's top officials. Similar protests took place around the nation Saturday. A heavier police presence than normal was on hand outside the arena in anticipation of the protest, which by all accounts remained peaceful. INGRAM'S NIGHT Ingram's 16 points was well below his average of 25.2 points per game that he entered with. But New Orleans countered with balanced scoring that included Jrue Holiday chipping in 19 points and Josh Hart 16.","401161175"
"LOS ANGELES --  A day after a 26-point loss to Memphis in another matinee, the Clippers had a least three players score at least 30 points for the first time in franchise history. Montrezl Harrell scored 34 points off the bench, reserve Lou Williams scored 32 to match starter Paul George, and Los Angeles beat the New York Knicks 135-132 on Sunday. It was the first time in the Clippers' history that three players scored at least 30 points. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time two players have scored 30 points off the bench in a regulation NBA game since the 1970-71 season. ""Montrezl and Lou were fantastic. History is good. Someone has to make it,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Harrell didn't say much after tying a career high and producing the seventh 30-point game of his four-year career. One day after saying the Clippers were ""not a great team"" following the embarrassment by Memphis, Harrell walked past reporters with a smile on his face and said, ""You all have a good Sunday."" George, who missed Saturday's game with left hamstring tightness, said it was important to not come out flat two afternoons in a row. ""We saw Lou and Montrezl lead the way. Watching that from the bench, it got us motivated. We knew the job we had to do,"" said George, who posted his seventh 30-point game this season. He was 9 of 14 from the field, including 5 of 6 on 3-pointers, in 32 minutes. Both teams shot 54% or more from the floor in a game that will not go down as a defensive masterpiece. Los Angeles was up by 15 late in the third quarter and 121-110 with 7:06 remaining in the game when George fouled out. New York scored eight straight points to draw within three and was still within one possession in the final minute when Williams drove the lane and hit a floating jumper with 18.5 seconds left to make it 133-128. Marcus Morris -- who led New York with a career-high 38 points -- hit a jumper with 10.4 seconds left to get the Knicks back within three, but Williams put it out reach after a timeout with a pair of free throws. ""You can win games with bad offense and good defense,"" Rivers said. ""Tonight people can say either the offense was phenomenal or both teams struggled defensively. The players will say one thing but the coaches will say the other."" Rivers might be surprised that George agreed with him. ""We still allowed too many points and have to get better,"" George said. ""It's an area we have to improve, but our offense got us over the hump today."" RJ Barrett added 24 points for New York and Julius Randle had 16 points and eight rebounds. ""At end of the day, we wanted to win but took a positive step in our competition level,"" Morris said. ""For us to be in the game against one of the top teams in the league and have a big lead says a lot."" Los Angeles trailed by 16 at the end of the first quarter but put up a 47-point second quarter to lead 76-69 at halftime. That was the most points scored in the second period of an NBA game this season and tied for the fourth most in any quarter. Williams led the way with 18 points in the period, including three straight 3-pointers that tied it at 51 with 7:16 remaining. Harrell had 14 points in the quarter, including 10 of the Clippers' first 13 points during the run. The Knicks went on a 24-8 run in the first quarter to lead 33-19. New York, which came in making 10.7 3-pointers per game, made four during its spurt while Randle scored seven points. The Knicks extended their lead to 45-29 at the end of the quarter as they went 19 of 29 from the field. The output was tied for the third-most points scored in the first 12 minutes of an NBA game this season and marked the first time the Knicks have scored at least 44 points and shot over 70% from the field in the first in nearly 11 years. The last time it happened was also against the Clippers, on March 25, 2009. ""It was one of the wilder games that I have been a part of,"" Knicks coach Mike Miller said. ""We put together a big first quarter and then it flipped. But we showed grit to stay in the game and put ourselves in position at the end."" TIP-INS Knicks: Taj Gibson, Morris and Randle received technical fouls during a 21-second span in the second quarter. ... New York is 6-8 under Miller, who took over after David Fizdale was fired. ... G Elfrid Payton was out for personal reasons. Frank Ntilikina got the start and had seven points. ...

"MIAMI --  James Johnson scored on his first possession in more than a month. Dragic either scored or got somebody else points pretty much every time the ball was in his hands. As often is the case for Miami, bench guys came up big. Dragic had 29 points and 13 assists, Bam Adebayo added 20 points on 9-for-10 shooting and the Heat -- without Jimmy Butler -- never trailed in a 122-111 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. ""It doesn't matter for us who's playing or not,"" Dragic said. ""We don't use excuses."" Dragic tied a career best with seven 3-pointers. Derrick Jones Jr. scored 19 points for the Heat, who got 14 from Kendrick Nunn and 12 in 22 minutes from little-used Johnson -- who was called upon largely because Miami was without Butler. It was Johnson's first minutes since Nov. 27. ""I've been in every situation that this league can offer, honestly,"" Johnson said. ""I know for sure it can be worse."" Tyler Herro scored 11 points for Miami, as did Meyers Leonard in his first game against his former team. Damian Lillard led Portland with 34 points and 12 assists. Former Heat center Hassan Whiteside, booed almost every time he touched the ball, finished with 21 points and 18 rebounds for Portland. ""It felt weird at first,"" Whiteside said of playing against his former club. ""But a lot of them guys I haven't played with. There were a few guys out there that I actually knew."" Both teams were missing starters unexpectedly. Miami was without Butler, ruled out because of back soreness. Portland played without the services of CJ McCollum for the first time this season; he was out with an upper-respiratory infection. ""Any time one of your best players is not on the floor you're going to be less of a team,"" Lillard said. ""We're professionals and that's when you turn to the next guy. ... It's tough not having him but they didn't have their best player. Anfernee Simons scored 19 points off the bench for Portland, which cut a 24-point deficit to nine in the third quarter but no closer. ""Whatever word you want to use, we didn't compete hard enough in the first half,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""They had us on our heels from the outset."" The Heat improved their NBA-best home record to 17-1 -- that's only two wins shy of their home total for 41 games last season -- and are 10-0 after losses. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said he still roots for Whiteside, who spent five years with Miami and got traded this summer as part of the series of moves that allowed the Heat to land Butler. ""We invested a lot into him and he invested a lot into us,"" Spoelstra said. ""For whatever reason -- it just happens in this business -- it was just time to turn the page on that team and it's not anyone's fault."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland, perhaps surprisingly, had won 12 of its last 15 games without McCollum over the last three-plus seasons. ... Carmelo Anthony played a game in Miami for the 21st time -- and just his second appearance there since Dec. 6, 2016. ... Portland fell to 2-18 when trailing after three quarters, 0-13 when trailing by more than seven points. Heat: Justise Winslow (bone bruise in back) missed his 15th consecutive game, though is apparently on the cusp of returning. ... Johnson played for the first time since Nov. 27 and for just the second time at home all season. ... Dion Waiters was available but still hasn't played this season. ... It was ""Kids Day"" and Spoelstra held his oldest son Santiago on-court for the national anthem. TENANT VS. LANDLORD Leonard opened the game guarding Whiteside, in the very rare -- and possibly unprecedented -- instance of a tenant guarding his landlord. Leonard and his wife are renting Whiteside's Miami house this season. ""You want a guy at your house who's going to take care of it,"" Whiteside said of Leonard, who, coincidentally, also occupies Whiteside's former locker. YEAGER HONORED As part of Miami's ""Home Strong"" program, retired Air Force brigadier general Chuck Yeager -- the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound -- was honored before the game. The 96-year-old Yeager visited with Heat President Pat Riley at halftime. Since the inception of the Home Strong program, the Heat have honored over 750 military personnel and their families on center court prior to the national anthem.","401161177"
"CLEVELAND --  Minnesota built a big lead, wasted it and then had to build another one. ""Sometimes,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said, ""you have to win a game twice."" Gorgui Dieng scored 22 points, Shabazz Napier had 21 and the Timberwolves blew a 25-point lead before regrouping for a 118-103 victory Sunday night over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who may have lost rookie Kevin Porter Jr. for an extended period with a knee injury. The Cavs, who rested star Kevin Love one night after he displayed frustration toward his teammates in a loss, trailed 90-65 with four minutes to go in the third quarter and seemed done. But Dante Exum got hot and his 3-pointer with 8:29 left capped a 32-6 blitz to give Cleveland a 97-96 lead. However, the Timberwolves recovered and scored 14 straight with Dieng dropping two 3-pointers during the five-minute stretch to help Minnesota avoid an embarrassing loss. ""We just ran out of gas,"" Cavs coach John Beilein said. Andrew Wiggins came back after missing four games with the flu and scored 15 for the struggling Timberwolves. They won for just the fourth time in 16 games. ""That was a locker room after the game where it didn't feel like a full road win,"" Saunders said. ""Our guys knew we came away with one in a situation where Cleveland outplayed us for a good amount of the second half. We did execute and buckle down defensively towards the end. We should feel good about that, but we should also not be satisfied."" Exum, recently acquired in a trade with Utah, scored a career-high 28 points -- 24 in the second half -- for the Cavs. Cleveland dropped its fourth in a row amid drama surrounding Love and a potentially serious injury to Porter. The 30th overall pick last yea hurt his left knee in the third quarter when his buckled awkwardly while he tried to change directions. The slender guard immediately grabbed his leg and had to be helped to Cleveland's locker room. Following the game, Porter was on crutches as he left the trainers' room. He was not available for comment. Exum said it was difficult seeing his new teammate in pain. ""I've been through my share of injuries, so it breaks my heart seeing that,"" Exum said. ""I hope he's going to be all right. I don't know the diagnosis right now,"" With the Cavs playing their second straight game, Love sat out for extra rest, his planned absence coming a night after he threw up his arms in disgust several times in a loss to Oklahoma City. Love has been the subject of trade rumors for months and his future in Cleveland has never been more in doubt. The Timberwolves were without center Karl-Anthony Towns. He missed his 10th straight game with a sprained left knee. Minnesota made four 3-pointers in the final two minutes of the first half with Robert Covington's 3 just before the horn giving the Timberwolves a 66-48 lead. Timberwolves: Dieng added 13 rebounds. ... Wiggins was the No. 1 overall pick by Cleveland in the 2014 draft before the Cavs traded him in the deal for Love. ... G Jeff Teague returned after missing two games with a sprained right knee and played 17 minutes. Cavaliers: Love sat on the bench in street clothes. Coach John Beilein did not say if he'll be disciplined for Saturday's outbursts, which included yelling at general manager Koby Altman during the morning shootaround. ... Cleveland was missing F Tristan Thompson (flu) and F Larry Nance (sore knee). HONORING FLIP The Timberwolves took a road trip Saturday night to Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, where a high school gymnasium was renamed in honor of former Minnesota coach Flip Saunders, who died in 2015. Ryan Saunders attended the ceremony for his father and center Towns made sure all the Timberwolves were there. Saunders learned some history about his dad, who was an all-state player at the school. ""They officially said his scoring average was 32 points per game his senior year, but then I remember that he used to tell me if there was a three-point line back then he would have averaged 44,"" Saunders said with a laugh. ""He had so much love for Cleveland. Minnesota adopted him, but Cleveland was his first love."" DANTE'S INFERNO Exum finished 11 of 13 from the floor, including 4 of 4 on 3-pointers in 24 minutes. After he scored 12 quick points in the fourth to give Cleveland its brief lead, an exhausted Exum went to the bench for a blow. As he prepared to check back in, Cleveland's crowd roared. ""Obviously, it's a really good feeling,"" he said. ""You come to a team and they don't really know you or know too much about you, but to feel the crowd behind me was good and I can't wait to keep playing here."" TOUGH LOVE Beilein said Love sitting out was pre-planned and not connected to his actions Saturday. His sticky situation hangs over the Cavs, who are trying to rebuild with youth. However, Beilein isn't worried about Love's behavior or attitude adversely affecting his young teammates. ""People are going to get frustrated in games and you just end up dealing with it,"" Beilein said. ""But it happens to everybody.""","401161178"
"PHOENIX --  A few bad decisions led to some anxious moments for the Grizzlies in the final minutes. A month or two ago, it all might have ended in a heartbreaking loss. But Memphis is a team that's growing up quickly and the final result was a 121-114 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. It was the second road win in two days for the Grizzlies and more proof that they might be building something interesting in the Western Conference. ""We're a young team, we're building this team for the next five or 10 years with these guys, you know?"" guard Dillon Brooks said. ""It's good that we're getting these games, because we're going to be in these games a lot. ""At the beginning of the year, we'd get in this predicament and lose. We're showing growth now."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 30 points and Brooks added 19, leading the Grizzlies to their fifth win in eight games. Memphis is 10-9 since Dec. 1. The Grizzlies led the entire second half and had a comfortable 96-77 advantage after three quarters, but had to fend off a pair of runs by the Suns in the final minutes. Phoenix pulled to 109-101 with under four minutes left, but Brooks made two straight 3-pointers from the corner to squash the momentum. The Suns quickly cut that 14-point deficit to 117-114 with 32 seconds left, but Ja Morant made a pair of free throws to finally put away the game. ""It got a little scary there at the end in the fourth, but we found a way to execute against their pressure and come up with some big stops down the stretch,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Devin Booker led the Suns with 40 points to break the franchise record for consecutive games with at least 30 with six. Charles Barkley and Charlie Scott shared the previous mark. The record was little solace for the fifth-year guard, who wasn't able to shoot the Suns to a win. ""Tonight was a step back,"" Booker said. ""We are going to have to respond, finish out this home-stand the right way and hopefully get a few wins before we head out back east."" Valanciunas shot 12 of 16 from the field, and Brooks made five 3-pointers before fouling out in the final minute. Jaren Jackson Jr. had 15 points and eight rebounds. The Grizzlies shot 54 percent from the field and made 18 3-pointers. ""It's a team that's going to come out and compete, play unselfish and together,"" Morant said. ""We all have one goal, same mindset."" The Grizzlies were coming off one of their most impressive wins of the season after beating the Clippers 140-114 on Saturday. They jumped ahead again one day later, leading the Suns 62-57 at halftime behind 20 points from Valanciunas. He made 8 of 9 shots in the first half, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Kelly Oubre finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns. Deandre Ayton had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Suns coach Monty Williams was obviously frustrated, giving one statement during his postgame press conference, but not taking any questions. ""Until we learn how to play the right way consistently, we're just going to have a lot of nights like this,"" Williams said. ""That's the deal."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis shot nearly 56% from the field in the first half and made 11 3-pointers. ... The Grizzlies are 2-1 against the Suns this season. The road team has won all three games. ... Memphis improved to 4-2 on the second night of back-to-back games. Suns: F Frank Kaminsky missed his fourth straight game with a knee injury. The team said Saturday that he'd miss at least the next four weeks and then be re-evaluated. ... Booker shot 13 of 20 from the field and 13 of 14 on free throws. He also had six assists.","401161179"
"LOS ANGELES --  After Dwight Howard blocked Andre Drummond's shot with a perfect combination of timing and athleticism, he wagged a Mutombo finger at the uproarious Staples Center crowd. The rest of the Lakers took off on a fast break that left them with a double-digit lead over Detroit in the fourth quarter. Although that lead vanished and the game got a whole lot scarier, the Lakers' historically huge block party propelled them to another win. LeBron James had 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists, and Anthony Davis had eight of the Lakers' 20 blocked shots in their fifth straight victory, 106-99 over the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night. By the time the Lakers' three big men were done swatting almost everything they could get their hands on, the Lakers had blocked more shots than any NBA team since March 2001. ""We were just protecting the paint,"" said Davis, who finished two blocks shy of his career high. ""Last game (against New Orleans), we gave up 60-something points in the paint. It's something we don't like doing, and we tried to make an emphasis tonight on protecting the paint."" That's an understatement: JaVale McGee blocked six shots, and Howard had four of his five blocks in the fourth quarter as the Lakers finished one blocked shot short of their franchise record. Los Angeles had 21 blocks against Denver in April 1982. Howard swatted Drummond twice in the final quarter, and he didn't regret playing to the fans. ""I was just in the moment, trying to get the crowd going,"" said Howard, who added 11 points and nine rebounds. ""Detroit had hit some big shots, and we needed a lift. AD, he inspired me to want to go out there and try to get as many as I can."" Davis scored 11 of his 24 points in the final 3:40 and added 11 rebounds for the Lakers, who blew a late 11-point lead and nearly lost to a team with a losing record for the first time all season. Instead, Alex Caruso scored 13 points while they hung on to remain unbeaten since Christmas. ""Our three big guys just played exceptional basketball,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""Those guys took a lot of pride in protecting our rim tonight."" James finished with his 90th career triple-double, his ninth of the season and his second in five days. Derrick Rose scored 28 points and former Lakers guard Svi Mykhailiuk had 14 -- one off his career high -- for the Pistons, who have lost nine of 11 despite a strong effort against the Western Conference leaders. ""Everything has got to go right to beat the top team in the league,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We played well, but we made just enough mistakes."" Drummond added 12 points on 2-of-13 shooting and 18 rebounds before fouling out late, and the Pistons finished the California portion of their six-game road trip with a heartbreaker. ""There's a reason they're the No. 1 team in the league blocking shots,"" Rose said. ""They've got great length, but it's not going to change the way we play our game. We've got a chance to learn from our mistakes."" TIP-INS Pistons: Blake Griffin missed his fourth straight game with knee soreness. The injury forced the longtime Clippers star to miss both of Detroit's games at Staples Center this season. ... Casey got a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing the severity of a foul call against James. Lakers: Caruso had a strong game off the bench after missing Friday's game with tightness in his right calf. ... Ohio State defensive end Chase Young watched the game from courtside next to agent Rich Paul, who represents Davis and James. Young announced Friday he'll enter the NFL draft, where he could be the first overall pick. INJURED LAKERS Avery Bradley got the Lakers' only blocked shot by a non-center, but he sprained his right ankle shortly before halftime and didn't return. The starter missed 13 games earlier in this season with a hairline fracture in his leg. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also went to the Lakers' locker room shortly before halftime after rolling his ankle, but the swingman walked it off and returned in the third quarter. FRANTIC FOURTH The Lakers scored the first 15 points of the fourth quarter in a rally spearheaded by James and Caruso, turning a four-point deficit into a 90-79 lead. After finally scoring nearly five minutes into the quarter, Detroit strung together nine straight points and a 13-1 run to reclaim the lead with 4:51 left. James' driving, two-handed dunk put the Lakers up 96-92 with 3:22 left, and Davis was unstoppable down the stretch. After Rose hit a 3-pointer with 1:52 left to trim LA's lead to one point, Davis replied with a corner 3, and Howard got the Lakers' 20th blocked shot moments later. SWAT TEAM The Lakers blocked eight shots in the first quarter alone, including four by Davis and three by McGee. Los Angeles blocked 12 shots and held Detroit to 35% shooting in the first half, but couldn't pull away while the Pistons made their first 21 consecutive free throws.","401161180"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  T.J. Warren enjoyed another impressive outing in front of his parents and good friends. The Pacers guard scored 30 of his 36 points in the second half, and Indiana beat the Charlotte Hornets 115-104 on Monday night to snap a two-game skid. Warren, who was born in Durham, North Carolina, and played at North Carolina State, had his previous season high of 33 points on Nov. 5 in Charlotte, although the Pacers lost that game. ""Just coming home and seeing my mom and dad in the stands, I just bring a different type of energy,"" Warren said. Indiana trailed by two at halftime but outscored Charlotte 37-21 in third quarter behind 13 points from Warren to open a 14-point lead. Warren finished 15 of 24 from the field and said the basket was looking ""pretty big"" in the second half. ""I just wanted to stay aggressive,"" he said. ""When you get in a rhythm like that and continue to build confidence, then everything just falls for you."" Domantas Sabonis added 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists, and Miles Turner had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Pacers, who had lost four of their previous five. The Pacers, who are 15-4 at home, improved to 8-10 on the road. Pacers coach Nate McMillan liked his team's ball movement, highlighted by 31 assists. ""Whenever you move the ball like that you're making the defense defend you and you're not just jacking up shots,"" McMillan said. ""I thought T.J. played a real smart game. There were some times when they double-teamed him and he got the ball out of the trap. But when he was able to get a look at the basket, he scored."" Terry Rozier had 28 points for the Hornets, whose two-game win streak ended. Devonte Graham, who finished with 22 points and six assists, tried to bring the Hornets back late. He hit back-to-back 3s from the right wing, but Warren answered with a dunk and then turned a fast-break layup into a three-point play to push the lead to 11 with 1:30 left in the game. ""It started on the defensive end and that generated our offense,"" Warren said. ""We were able to get open looks and capitalize tonight. We picked up the pace on defense."" Said Hornets center Cody Zeller: ""When a good player gets it rolling like that, it's tough to do much against him."" The Pacers dominated in the paint, outscoring the Hornets 66-46. ""I think overall it was Indiana's physicality mentality,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""They just played with more force in the second half. We were too casual. They were the aggressive team. T.J. Warren was fantastic in the second half and he started in the third quarter. He got them going."" TIP-INS Pacers: Jeremy Lamb had 11 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. ...

"Kyrie Irving describes his emotions while dealing with his shoulder injury and is focused on moving toward getting better. (1:29) ORLANDO, Fla. --  Markelle Fultz had the best game of his career and the Orlando Magic needed it to get past the slumping Brooklyn Nets. Fultz scored a career-high 25 points, including seven straight during a 15-1 run in the fourth quarter that lifted the Magic over the Nets 101-89 on Monday night. ""I was just out there playing in the flow of the game, being aggressive,"" said Fultz, the top pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. ""I knew I had a shot or I could pass to my teammates. It just happened that I had open shots, so I took advantage of those."" Fultz was 11 for 20 from the field with four assists and two steals. ""I didn't like how much he got to the rim,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""The 3s we'll live with, but all the rim attempts ... that was too much. He did a great job of driving it. He hurt us in transition. He played a great game."" Nikola Vucevic had 24 rebounds and 11 points for his 300th career double-double, and the Magic pulled away in the final seven minutes after going 9:20 without a field goal. Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 16 apiece for the Nets, who lost their sixth straight game after charging back from a 16-point deficit to take a lead in the fourth quarter. They shot 33% for the game. Seven players scored in double figures for the Magic. D.J. Augustin came off the bench to contribute 16 points and five assists. Even though Harris scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting, the Nets fell behind by 16 while shooting 29.8% (14 for 47) in the first half. Orlando led 52-39 at halftime, but Dinwiddie had 12 points in the third quarter and Dzanan Musa scored Brooklyn's last six points of the period to get the Nets back in it. Wilson Chandler's short jumper with 8:57 left in the fourth pulled the Nets ahead, 78-76. Two free throws by Evan Fournier then launched a 15-1 surge for Orlando over the next 4 1/2 minutes. Fultz followed with a layup, another layup and a 3-pointer from the corner. ""That was Markelle being aggressive and taking advantage of the transition and having the lane open,"" Fournier said. ""That's what he does every night, to be honest. It's just there was an open lane, he took it twice, and that shot in the corner was just the fruit of his work.""

"Joel Embiid explains how he was in a lot of pain when he dislocated his finger. (0:24) PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid's left ring finger looked like the top of a used bendy drinking straw, grotesquely overlapping his pinkie to the point that it seemed he had his fingers crossed. ""I nearly threw up when I saw that,"" 76ers guard Ben Simmons said. So gross. Simmons' stomach was soon settled, and so were the Sixers when Embiid needed nothing more than a quick trip to the locker room and some tape. Embiid played through the unsightly injury and scored 18 points, Simmons had 17 points and 15 rebounds and Philadelphia snapped a four-game losing streak, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder 120-113 on Monday night. ""I'm glad he came back out,"" Simmons said. ""We needed him. He's a big part of this team."" The 76ers lost all four games on a trip that knocked them down the Eastern Conference standings and raised questions about how far this team can go in the playoffs. They usually last in the postseason as long as a healthy Embiid can take them. The All-Star center dislocated his finger in the first quarter. Embiid returned to start the second quarter, though the injury prevented him from playing with his usual force on the glass and he lost a bunch of rebounds to Steven Adams. ""I felt my finger snapping and I thought I fractured it,"" Embiid said. ""They did some X-rays and said it was nothing."" Embiid said there was a chance he might not play Thursday against Boston. ""I couldn't go up with two hands,"" Embiid said. ""There were a couple of times I could have grabbed with both hands but I just couldn't. I just kept tapping it."" The Thunder, who had won five straight, closed within two with 3 minutes left before the Sixers scored nine straight points to put the game away. Embiid's fingers looked fine on a dish to Tobias Harris for a dunk, and Harris buried a 3 to make it 115-106. Adams had 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Chris Paul scored 18 points. ""We've gotten down and these guys always fight back,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Josh Richardson scored 23 points for the Sixers, and Simmons fell two assists shy of a triple-double in another solid game without a basket beyond 22 feet. Simmons is an All-Star and triple-double threat but for whatever reason, he won't shoot 3-pointers. His only two career 3s have come this season and after he made one in a Dec. 7 win against Cleveland, coach Brett Brown implored Simmons to shoot more of them. ""This is what I want,"" Brown said that night. ""I want a 3-point shot per game, minimum. He will be liberated. His world will open up and, in many ways, so will ours."" Simmons responded to Brown's edict by doubling down on his refusal to shoot 3s. He had a meaningless heave in a Dec. 10 game against Denver but otherwise has not attempted an honest 3. Brown acknowledged Simmons has disregarded his request. ""Evidently, I have failed,"" Brown said. ""It's something that we're all mindful and this is one of these things that is never going to go away. The attention that this has received is remarkable. I guess I helped fuel it. I own it. I've got to help him find this and most importantly he has to help himself."" The Sixers need more 3-point shooting, period. They made only six in each of the last two losses and returned home hopeful of finding the stroke that saw them hit a franchise record-tying 21 3s in a Christmas Day win over Milwaukee. ""This team needs to find more 3-point opportunities. We do,"" Brown said. ""We need to hunt 3s in a more definitive way than we currently are."" The 76ers got that message, at least early, and they finished an efficient 13 for 26 on 3s. Harris hit three of Philly's eight 3s (on 14 attempts) in the first half for a 62-52 lead at the break. But they hit just two in the third -- and whiffed on a few easy looks at the basket -- and had their 14-point lead sliced to 90-86. TIP-INS Thunder: Missed 10 of 31 free throws. Dennis Schroder scored 21 points. 76ers: Shot 51% from the floor. OLD FRIENDS Donovan coached 76ers F Al Horford to consecutive NCAA championships at Florida and remains a fan of the All-Star. ""That's the one thing with Al, he can figure out and look at the dynamics of the team and then he can figure out what he's got to do to impact the team,"" Donovan said. ""He's got a really good awareness of what he needs to do to help the group.""","401161183"
"WASHINGTON --  Chants of M-V-P! flooded the arena as Ish Smith -- yes, the 31-year-old reserve guard of 11 NBA teams across 10 seasons -- stepped to the line for a pair of free throws in the fourth quarter. He was, after all, in the middle of a second consecutive star turn for the injury-depleted Wizards, scoring 14 of his game-high 27 points in the final period -- including 10 in a row on 5-for-5 shooting in one stretch -- to lead lowly Washington past the Boston Celtics 99-94 Monday night. If it was a two-game season, I would have to agree with the crowd: MVP, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said with a smile afterward. And he's bringing back the mid-range. He's hard to stay in front of. His change of direction. His pace. The speed. Smith grew up on AND1 mixtapes (look em up) and was prodded to watch clips of Steve Nash and Tony Parker by Skip Prosser, his college coach at Wake Forest. So there are definite traces of flashiness and dont-relinquish-the-dribble in Smith's game, on full display against Boston and in Washington's previous outing, when he had a career-high 32 points in a win over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday. ""He's on skates right now and he's feeling in a great rhythm,"" said Boston coach Brad Stevens, whose team had won eight of nine games but was missing Kemba Walker because of the flu for the third in a row. It's a great example of playing a guy when he's in a great groove, Stevens said about Smith. ""You have to break his rhythm, and we didn't do that."" As for Smith's reaction to the crowd's boisterous support and those three little letters they shouted? The last time that happened, probably, was high school, Smith said. He made 12 of 18 shots and chipped in four assists and four rebounds off the bench for Washington. He just got super comfortable out there, Boston's Jaylen Brown said, and he just made play after play after play."" The Wizards are without six leading members of its roster because of injuries. That includes All-Stars Bradley Beal (out for the fifth time in the last six games because of a sore right leg) and John Wall (sidelined all season so far after Achilles surgery), starters Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant, and leading subs Davis Bertans and Moe Wagner. We have so many moving parts, Brooks said. Boston became the latest NBA contender to surprisingly come up short against one of the league's worst teams. The Wizards have picked up wins over Miami, Denver and Boston in their past five outings. The Celtics never led this one. Washington was up by 11 at halftime, but that dwindled to zero when Jaylen Brown's 3-pointer made it 80-all with 8 minutes left. That was a rare bright spot for Brown and Boston, though. He scored 23 points but shot 7 for 22, Marcus Smart was 3 for 14, Jayson Tatum was 8 for 20, and Gordon Hayward was 4 for 11, including an air ball on a wide-open 3 attempt with under 90 seconds remaining. Boston entered the day second in the Eastern Conference at 25-8. Washington, in contrast, came in at 11-24, fewer wins than all but three teams in the 15-club East. ""Sometimes, we don't have a lot of scoring options out there, but I can honestly say we have a lot of effort options out there,"" Brooks said, ""and that's a good thing to have."" TIP-INS Celtics: Robert Williams missed his 13th game in a row since Dec. 6; he as a left hip problem. Coach Brad Stevens said Williams would meet with a specialist in New York on Tuesday. Wizards: As if they needed any more health issues, lost rookie guard Garrison Mathews to a sprained right ankle in the second quarter. ... Had lost four consecutive games against Boston. DRAWN AND QUARTERED Washington held Denver to an opponent-low 19 points in the first quarter Saturday, then bettered that by giving up just 17 to Boston in the opening period. Asked to explain, Smith replied: Now we're getting it: We're communicating.","401161184"
"ATLANTA -- Nikola Jokic wasn't keeping track of his points as the night wore on. He just knew he was scoring a lot. ""I never know that,"" he said. ""I just liked the flow of the game. I think I made a few shots and got to the line a little bit, and I think the flow was really good for me."" Jokic scored a career-high 47 points, Will Barton added a season-best 28, and the Denver Nuggets held off the Atlanta Hawks 123-115 on Monday. The Nuggets, coming off a surprising loss at Washington two nights earlier, have won four of six to improve to 25-11, second in the Western Conference. Atlanta, worst in the NBA at 8-29, has dropped 11 of 13. Trae Young finished with 29 points, and Kevin Huerter had 22 for the Hawks. Jokic's previous career high of 41 points was set Nov. 7, 2017, at home against Brooklyn. His previous season high of 31 came at home nine days ago against Memphis. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Jokic is the third center with 45 points and no turnovers in a game, joining Shaquille O'Neal (Nov. 9, 1994, at Hornets) and Moses Malone (April 8, 1987, at Nets). Turnovers were first tracked in 1977-78. ""We go as he goes,"" Barton said. ""I feel like no one can stop him."" Jokic surpassed his previous career high with a putback that gave Denver a 114-109 lead with 3:14 remaining. Jamal Murray followed with a turnaround jumper in the lane, and Barton put back his own miss to put the Nuggets up 118-109 at the 1:57 mark. That essentially ended all hopes for the Hawks, but it wasn't entirely easy for Denver. After John Collins' dunk cut the lead to 91-88 just 22 seconds into the fourth quarter, Nuggets coach Michael Malone called a timeout. Monte Morris followed with a runner, and Michael Porter Jr. jammed in a putback to make it 95-88. The Hawks cut the margin to one before Barton found Morris for an alley-oop and hit a 3-pointer to make it 106-100 with 6:54 remaining. Atlanta pulled within two on Young's 35-footer with 4:24 left, and Malone called another timeout. The move worked, as the Hawks made just three field goals the rest of the way. Huerter's second straight 3 cut the lead to two at the 6:07 mark of the third, and then Malone called a timeout. Jokic quickly followed with a jumper, then stole the ball in the lane from Alex Len to set up Murray's two free throws. ""Jokic is definitely a very skilled player,"" Collins said. ""I felt like he got to the line a lot tonight, which gave him a little bit of a boost, but I still feel like down the stretch and for four quarters, we did a solid job just trying to make him take tough shots. We did the best we could."" Jerami Grant's three-point play made it 36-34 at the 9:37 mark of the second, and the Nuggets didn't trail again. About three minutes later, Grant rebounded a missed Hawks shot and drove for a layup that gave Denver its first double-digit lead. Murray's layup in the final second put the Nuggets up by nine at halftime. TIP-INS Nuggets: Murray and Barton both returned after overcoming minor injuries that caused them to leave in the third. Murray, who finished with 16 points after scoring a season-high 39 at Washington, knelt down before walking off the floor after getting tangled up on Len's hard screen. Barton's right knee knocked against De'Andre Hunter's knee early in the third. ... Murray missed a free throw in the third, ending a streak of 37 straight makes from the foul line. ... It was Barton's 29th birthday. ... Denver outrebounded the Hawks 40-34 and has won 12 straight and 17 of 19 when leading on the boards. ... The Nuggets are 7-4 in games decided by 10 or fewer points. Hawks: Young made a dazzling move early in the fourth, faking a behind-the-back pass as he was driving past Morris and Porter to dribble the ball between his legs before making a right-handed layup. ... F Vince Carter, a 42-year-old in his final season, jumped in the lane to block Gary Harris' dunk attempt out of bounds midway through the fourth. ... F Jabari Parker, the team's third-leading scorer, missed his fourth straight game due to a right shoulder impingement. AVENGED The Nuggets lost 125-121 to the Hawks at home in mid-November, as Young had 42 points and 11 assists. Denver had dropped nine of 11 in Atlanta. ""The Hawks beat us on our home court,"" Barton said. ""We had to come in and handle business.""","401161185"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Utah center Rudy Gobert wasn't going to allow the Pelicans' Brandon Ingram to blow by him for a layup at the final horn without getting his 7-foot-1 frame and long arms in the way. Incredulous players leaped off the Pelicans bench pleading for a foul, suggesting there was no small measure of debate over whether Gobert's challenge was a legal one. Gobert's stop preserved a 128-126 Jazz victory over New Orleans on Monday night that extended Utah's winning streak to six games. ""I went straight up with my arms. I got the ball with my forearm, and then we both just fell,"" Gobert said. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 35 points and Joe Ingles added 22 for the Jazz, who have won 11 of 12. ""We are playing great basketball lately,"" Bogdanovic said. But the final play of Utah's last triumph is likely to be noted in the NBA's Last Two Minute Report from the game, which generally is released the following day. ""I think I got hit but the referee didn't see it. That's the reality of it,"" said Ingram, whose 35 points were not quite enough to lift the recently resurgent Pelicans to a seventh victory in nine games. Replays showed Gobert making body-to-body contact with Ingram after chasing the Pelicans forward down the right side of the lane. But Ingram also had his left arm wrapped around Gobert's torso. And while Gobert appeared to hit Ingram's shooting wrist as the shot was released, the Utah center's arm seemed to graze the ball first. ""It was a foul . nothing more, nothing less,"" Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball said. ""We should have gotten two free throws."" Utah coach Quinn Snyder, meanwhile, lauded Gobert for ""a great play."" ""We felt during live play that Rudy played legal defense,"" official Kane Fitzgerald, the crew chief for the game, told a pool reporter. Jazz players celebrated Gobert's defensive stop and quickly disappeared down the tunnel toward their locker room. Officials briefly went to the scorer's table to check if there should be any time left and then ruled the game over, eliciting a cascade of boos from the crowd. ""Rudy blocked it. That's why we ran off the court,"" Utah guard Donavan Mitchell said, bringing up another pivotal late-game block by Gobert in a close victory at Chicago two games earlier. ""That's the second time of this road trip he's done that. ... I knew Rudy was going to meet him at the rim."" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said he didn't get an explanation from officials. ""All we did is exactly what we were supposed to do: took the ball, drove it hard to the basket, and then they determined that it wasn't a foul. End of game,"" Gentry said. Officials also did not grant a timeout that Ball and Gentry appeared to signal for momentarily as Ingram kept his dribble while sprinting more than half the length of the court. Ball said the plan was to call a timeout, but added that when Ingram is ""going full stride, not many people can stop that."" Gobert had 19 rebounds and nine points, and Mitchell capped a 19-point night with a driving floater in the lane that broke a 126-all tie with 1:12 left. That wound up being the winning basket as the Pelicans missed their final three shots and Utah its last two. The game had 18 lead changes and 11 ties. Utah briefly went up by 11 in the third quarter and the Jazz maintained a slim lead for most of the fourth until Ball, who had 21 points, hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 121 with 3:15 left. Ingles' free throws and his left-handed alley-oop feed across the lane to Gobert helped Utah take a five-point lead before J.J. Redick's free throws and Ingram's 3 tied it at 126. Redick finished with 23 points for the Pelicans, who were without second-leading scorer Jrue Holiday (19.6 points per game) for the first time this season because of his bruised left elbow. TIP-INS Jazz: Ingles made four 3s and the Jazz, who came in averaging 12.4 per game, finished with 16. ... Bogdanovic hit 11 of 21 shots, including three 3s, and all 10 of his free throws. ... Utah improved to 11-2 with the starting lineup of Mitchell, Ingles, Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale and Gobert. ... The Jazz improved to 11-9 on the road. Pelicans: Derrick Favors had 10 rebounds and three blocks, including one on Gobert that led to Ingram's tying 3 in the final two minutes. ... Ingram has scored 30 or more eight times in New Orleans' first 37 games. ... E'Twaun Moore scored 13 points but missed all four 3s he attempted. ROOKIE MAGIC While top overall draft choice Zion Williamson has yet to make his debut, the Pelicans' other two first-round picks -- center Jaxson Hayes and guard Nickeill Alexander-Walker -- combined for a memorable highlight that caused a frenzy in the stands. Alexander-Walker, selected 17th overall, floated an alley-oop pass well above the rim as he began to drive the lane. Hayes corralled it with his right hand just before it hit about halfway up the backboard and slammed the ball down. The Pelicans seemed to feed off the energy created by the play, which came early in a 16-3 run to close the third quarter that put them up 97-95.","401161186"
"DALLAS --  It wasn't the 38 points, the 11 rebounds or the 10 assists from Luka Doncic that most impressed his coach on Monday night. It was his poise. But the production didn't hurt either. Doncic scored 21 points in the third quarter and had his NBA-leading 11th triple-double of the season to lead the Dallas Mavericks past the Chicago Bulls 118-110 Monday night. Doncic scored 17 of the Mavs' 19 points in the final 5:35 of the third to break open what had been a tie game. His 3 gave Dallas a 72-69 lead it would not relinquish. ""I thought tonight the most impressive thing about his game was his demeanor and his disposition and his poise,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Teams are sending athletic guys to be physical and banging him, and he really stayed level-headed."" The 20-year-old scored at least 20 in a quarter for the second time this season. He hit three 3s over that decisive stretch and scored four other times on drives to the basket, including a rainbow floater that banked in as he was getting fouled. His only blip was missing the subsequent free throw. ""For me, all that matters is we got to win,"" Doncic said. ""We needed that win coming from a loss (in overtime to Charlotte on Saturday) that we should have won. My team is helping a lot. We just played tough from the start to the end and that's how it's got to be."" Dwight Powell added 16 points for Dallas on 6-for-6 shooting from the floor and 4-for-4 from the line. The Mavericks played without Kristaps Porzingis for the fourth straight game due to right knee soreness. Lauri Markkanen led the Bulls with 26 points, starting the game despite spraining his left ankle Saturday night against Boston. ""I was proud of Markkanen fighting through. (He) played his heart out,"" Chicago coach Jim Boylen said. ""I thought our guys played really hard, competed."" Chicago stayed close throughout the game, even after losing forward Wendell Carter Jr. to a right ankle sprain with 8:25 left in the third quarter. Chicago went on a quick 10-2 run after Carter's injury to tie the score at 69 before Doncic took over. TIP-INS Bulls: Tomas Satoransky had a career-high 14 assists. ... Chandler Hutchison played for the first time since Nov. 27, recovering from a right shoulder sprain. . Chicago fell to 1-15 this season against teams over .500. Mavericks: Reserve forward Ryan Broekhoff is working with a group of his fellow Australian NBA and G League players to raise money for those affected by the bushfires in his native country. ""There's a small group of (Australians in the NBA) and we're all very close,"" Broekhoff said. ""It's kind of us doing our little bit to raise awareness and get donations."" ... J.J. Barea played his 619th game for the Mavs, tying Jason Terry for sixth-most in franchise history. AN ANKLE FOR AN ANKLE Markkanen was upgraded from doubtful to questionable during the Bulls' shootaround and then tested the ankle in warm-ups. ""I warmed up and it felt pretty good,"" Markkanen said. ""I didn't feel much pain. Just got to fight through. I know how much pain I can tolerate."" But in the third quarter, the Bulls suffered another ankle injury Carter went down after landing awkwardly on Powell's foot while going up for a layup. Carter, who played just 44 games last year because of thumb surgery, was taken off the court on a wheelchair. X-rays were negative. HARDAWAY RETURNS Dallas got a big lift from the return of Tim Hardaway Jr., who missed the past three games with a left hamstring strain. Hardaway scored 14 points in the first quarter on 5-for-5 shooting with three 3s. Carlisle restricted his minutes, and Hardaway finished with 15 points in 21 minutes. ""I'm happy I was able to make an impact and play within the offense,"" Hardaway said. ""I credit the guys. They did a phenomenal job of finding me and making it easy for me to knock down shots.""","401161187"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Known as a mid-range shooting team for the past few seasons, the Spurs are starting to comprehend why San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich has implored them to shoot more 3-pointers. DeMar DeRozan had 25 points and the San Antonio Spurs had a season-high 19 3-pointers to beat Milwaukee 126-104 on Monday night, snapping the Bucks five-game winning streak. ""It's big, confidence building,"" DeRozan said. ""Letting us know we could compete with the best teams in this league."" San Antonio finished 19 for 35 on 3-pointers in handing Milwaukee it's largest defeat of the season. Patty Mills added 21 points, including 6 for 10 on 3-pointers. LaMarcus Aldridge and Rudy Gay added 18 points each, going a combined 4 for 5 on 3-pointers. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists for Milwaukee and Donte DiVincenzo added 16 points. Four games after setting a season-high with 18 3-pointers against Detroit, the Spurs bested that mark when Gay hit the team's 19th against Milwaukee. Aldridge has keyed that run, going 16 for 23 on 3-pointers in his last five games. ""With LaMarcus joining us on the 3-point line and having the ability to knock them down, it does wonders in terms of spacing,"" Mills said. Aldridge has shot so well on 3s that the Bucks almost overlooked DeRozan's mid-range game. ""We have a ton of respect for (DeRozan),"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think the way Aldridge has been shooting the 3-point shot over the last five, six, seven games, a lot of talk was about, `Could we reduce those.' He had a huge first quarter, first half on Saturday. I don't want to say live with DeRozan's 2s, but to some degree (we did), but I still think it's the 3-point line where they beat us."" The Bucks, whose last loss was Dec. 25 at Philadelphia, maintain the league's best record at 32-6. Popovich somewhat agreed when asked if this was the Spurs' most complete game of the season. ""It'd be hard to argue against that, I think,"" he said. ""The physicality was good. We started out the third quarter a little poorly as we have, going to try to figure that out, but I thought we were more consistent tonight in our physicality and executing game plan, we were more consistent. It was a good night."" Milwaukee defeated San Antonio 127-118 on Saturday at home but could not maintain its early momentum in a rare home-and-home, back-to-back games. Milwaukee opened the game with three straight 3-pointers but San Antonio went on a 13-4 run in taking its first lead at 15-13. DeRozan blocked Antetokounmpo layup during the run, tying up the 6-foot-11 forward as he drove through the lane and forcing a jump ball. Seven players would score in the first quarter for San Antonio, including nine by DeRozan. The Spurs followed that up with 38 points in the second quarter, their highest total in that quarter all season and third-highest in any quarter. San Antonio was 12 for 20 on 3-pointers in the first half in building an 18-point lead and tying a franchise record for the most 3s in any half. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee G Pat Connaughton missed the game with a bruised right thigh. Connaughton had five points and four rebounds in 18 minutes Saturday against the Spurs. . DiVincenzo reached double figures for the 16th time this season but first since scoring 10 against Atlanta on Dec. 27 . The Bucks trail their all-time series with the Spurs, 41-50, but had won five of the previous six meetings after losing nine straight to San Antonio. Spurs: Aldridge has 7,781 career field goals, surpassing former Spurs teammate Tony Parker for 43rd in league history . Murray joined Alvin Roberts and Willie Anderson as the only players in franchise history with 1,000 points, 600 rebounds and 400 assists in their first 150 career games. . San Antonio also made 12 3-pointers in the first half at Charlotte on Dec. 8, 2012. MOMENTUM KILLER Popovich's timing on calling timeouts has drawn Antetokounmpo's respect, but not his appreciation. ""He drives me crazy. He drives me crazy,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Whenever you try to get a momentum, you knock down a 3, then you get a steal, get a dunk or something, he just calls a timeout and the momentum blows away. But (it's) smart. That's how they do it in Europe (and) that's what he does. He definitely helps his team.""","401161188"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  With two dunks already under his belt, including an impressive one-hander from the right side of the lane, Sacramentos Trevor Ariza thought he had a chance at a third after getting a steal near midcourt. His 34-year-old legs said otherwise, and Ariza settled for a layup then chuckled as he ran back to play defense on a rare night when the Kings could afford to laugh, even at themselves. ""Flat tire,"" Ariza said. ""These legs dont work like that anymore. It was a flat tire."" DeAaron Fox had 21 points and seven assists, Buddy Hield also scored 21 and the Kings thumped the Golden State Warriors 111-98 on Monday. Ariza added a season-high 18 points and six rebounds for the Kings, and Harrison Barnes scored 18 as well. Sacramento led by 31 on the way to winning for only the second time in 11 games, allowing coach Luke Walton to rest most of his starters in the fourth quarter. We were more consistent tonight, Walton said. We continued to do what we wanted to do offensively. We got better and made some progress tonight. It was the Kings' second lopsided win over the Warriors this season, having beaten Golden State 100-79 on the road Dec. 15. Ariza shot 7 of 9 after coming off the bench. He made five of his first six shots, including a pair of 3-pointers and the two dunks to get the Kings off to a quick start. He played 32 minutes for the second consecutive game. I felt like my normal self a little bit, Ariza said. Sometimes you just have to sacrifice, play your role. Tonight I made a few shots and the ball went in. Glenn Robinson III had 16 points and five rebounds for Golden State. Omari Spellman added 13 points and six rebounds. The Warriors, who played without Draymond Green and DAngelo Russell, have lost five straight after a season-high four-game winning streak. When we needed some shots and the ball to go in, we had a couple of forced shots, Robinson said. We really didn't trust each other. That's the key to this team, playing as hard as we can and trusting each other out there. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was ejected late in the second quarter after getting hit with consecutive technical fouls by referee Jason Goldenberg. Kerr appeared initially upset about a continuation call that went the Kings' way, then erupted after Golden State did not receive a similar call. Kerr angrily walked onto the court after the second technical and yelled at Goldenberg before leaving. The Kings led by 16 in the first half and then made eight 3-pointers to pull away in the third quarter. Hield and Corey Joseph hit back-to-back 3s and Harry Giles followed with a floater to make it 83-52. TIP-INS Warriors: Assistant coach Mike Brown took over after Kerr was ejected.  Golden State shot 5 of 26 on 3-pointers.  Green (left ankle sprain) and Russell (bruised right shoulder) were held out. Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic (ankle soreness) did not play.  Sacramento had lost four straight home games to the Warriors dating to 2017.  Giles was whistled for a technical foul in the fourth quarter.  Former Kings guard Mike Bibby, who played seven seasons in Sacramento, sat courtside next to owner Vivek Ranadive. MORE PAIN FOR THE KINGS Already short on big men with Marvin Bagley III unavailable because of a left foot sprain, the Kings took another hit when Richaun Holmes left the game with a right shoulder injury. Walton said Holmes would accompany the Kings on their flight to Arizona but had no further information. Any extended absence would be a big blow. Holmes leads Sacramento with 13 double-doubles.","401161189"
"CLEVELAND --  The Detroit Pistons, tired and dragging at the end of a long road trip, had every reason to look past the Cleveland Cavaliers. Derrick Rose and Andre Drummond wouldn't let that happen. Rose hit the go-ahead shot with 27 seconds left, and Drummond finished with 23 points and 20 rebounds as the Pistons rallied to beat the Cavaliers 115-113 Tuesday night. Rose, who scored 24 points, scored on a runner in the lane to give Detroit a 114-113 lead and cap a comeback that began with the Pistons trailing 100-91 early in the fourth quarter. ""I think it was a floater, a little floater,"" said Rose, who played a season-high 31 minutes. ""All I know is it went in."" The win provided some good news for the Pistons, who were playing the finale of a six-game trip. Star forward Blake Griffin had surgery on his left knee and will face an extended rehabilitation period. The Pistons said they have no timetable for his return. Detroit trailed by 15 points in the first half and seemed on the verge of getting a knockout punch several times, but the Pistons managed to persevere and finished 2-4 on its trip. ""We didn't want to end a trip like that,"" Rose said. ""We're just happy to get the win, especially after the way we played in the first half."" Drummond's big night marked his 38th career game of 20 points and 20 rebounds. ""Use any superlative you have for him,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""He played great."" Cleveland set up for a go-ahead shot after Rose's basket, but Collin Sexton was called for stepping out of bounds with seven seconds left. The ruling was overturned, but Sexton's shot in the lane didn't hit the rim and Detroit was awarded possession on a shot-clock violation. Drummond made one of two free throws with 1.6 seconds to play for a two-point lead. Drummond tipped away Kevin Love's long pass for Tristan Thompson and the clock ran out. Love matched a season high with 30 points, but had only two shots in the fourth quarter. Love made Cleveland's last basket, a 3-pointer with 2:57 to go, as the rebuilding Cavaliers continue to have problems closing out games. ""We've had moments where we've been able to do that and moments like tonight where we have to learn and look at tape and look at even just like a two minute drill and finding out what we could have done better,"" Love said. ""We were trying to get the ball away from Kevin Love,"" Casey said. ""We wanted to make him give it up to other guys."" Love has been the center of attention for his recent behavior, which included an outburst on the bench in Toronto last week, and showing up his teammates and coaches during a loss to Oklahoma City on Saturday. Love spoke about the incidents at Tuesday's shoot-around,calling his actions ""childish."" He was 12 of 15 from the field and gave the Cavaliers an extra possession when he dove on the floor for a loose ball in the fourth quarter. Cleveland lost its fifth straight and was winless on its four-game homestand. THAT'S A LOT OF PACKING Detroit completed its first trip with games in all four time zones since Dec. 5-16, 1979. The Pistons played both Los Angeles teams, Golden State, Utah and San Antonio. The Cavaliers open a similar trip Thursday in Detroit that will also take them to play the Lakers, Clippers, Denver, Memphis and Chicago. TIP-INS Pistons: Casey said that he hasn't been given any indication if Griffin will play again this season. ...

"TORONTO -- With Damian Lillard double-teamed, Carmelo Anthony stepped up to sink the game-winning basket for the Portland Trail Blazers. Anthony made a clutch shot with four seconds remaining, and Portland rallied to beat the Toronto Raptors 101-99 on Tuesday. He has hit 17 go-ahead field goals in the final five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, four more than any other player since 2003-04. ""A guy with his type of ability, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Lillard said. ""He had one guy guarding him, and he got to his spot. Once he got to his spot and I saw him raising up, I thought it was going in."" Anthony scored 28 points, Lillard had 20, and Hassan Whiteside added 14 points and 16 rebounds for his sixth straight double-double as the Trail Blazers snapped a four-game losing streak in Toronto and won for the second time in 10 meetings with the defending champion Raptors. ""This is a big confidence-booster for us, a big morale boost,"" Anthony said. Blazers coach Terry Stotts agreed. ""I was really proud of the way our team competed tonight, particularly in the fourth quarter,"" Stotts said. ""At the end of the season, you look back on different games, and this could very well be a game that we look back on that turned the tide."" Portland had lost six of seven overall. The Blazers improved to 2-12 against opponents with winning records. Anfernee Simons scored 12 points, and CJ McCollum had 10 after sitting out Sunday's loss in Miami because of an upper-respiratory infection. The Blazers trailed 78-69 through three quarters, then fell behind 85-73 with 8:20 to go. Lillard tied it at 99 on a 35-foot 3-pointer with 38 seconds left in the fourth, leading to a Raptors timeout. Toronto coach Nick Nurse was adamant that Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had been the victim of an illegal screen by Whiteside on Lillard's deep 3. ""It was clearly, clearly an offensive foul on Whiteside that wiped us out to tie the game,"" Nurse said. Toronto's Patrick McCaw turned it over with 13.6 seconds remaining, giving the Blazers a chance at a winning shot. With Lillard under wraps, McCollum took the inbounds pass and got the ball to Anthony, who connected from near the free throw line. Kyle Lowry got one final chance for the Raptors, but his off-balance 3 bounced off the rim at the buzzer. Portland connected on 12 of 19 attempts in the fourth, making six shots from long range. Lowry had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Serge Ibaka added 17 points and 11 rebounds as the injury-ravaged Raptors lost for just the second time in 16 games against opponents with losing records. Toronto's only other loss to a sub-.500 team came against Boston in the second game of the season, when the Celtics were 0-1. Oshae Brissett scored a career-high 12 points for Toronto, and Chris Boucher had 12, including 10 straight Raptors points in the fourth. Raptors guard Fred VanVleet sat out because of a strained right hamstring, joining a group of injured Toronto starters that includes Norman Powell (left shoulder), Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and Pascal Siakam (groin). VanVleet limped off late in the fourth quarter of Saturday's win at Brooklyn and did not practice Monday. Nurse said it would be ""a little bit"" before the team determined a timeline for VanVleet's return. Hollis-Jefferson started for VanVleet. EJECTED Portland's Kent Bazemore was ejected with 3:06 left in the third after a double technical. Bazemore got tossed for arguing after complaining about several non-calls. ""Just frustrated and took it upon myself to express it,"" Bazemore said. TIME TO LEAD Besides the final score, Portland's only other lead was 4-3 in the first quarter. The Blazers led for a total of 18 seconds. MELO MOOD Portland is 5-3 when Anthony scores 20 or more. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland shot 1-for-8 from 3-point range in the first quarter. ... Lillard attempted three shots in the first half. He shot 5-for-8 in the final two quarters. Raptors: In their first home game since his death on New Year's Day, the Raptors honored late NBA Commissioner David Stern with a video tribute and a moment of silence. ... Asked about Powell's return, Nurse said, ""We should see him soon."" ... G Matt Thomas returned after missing 21 games because of a broken left middle finger.

"Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Hamidou Diallo give the skinny on what goes into their game-day outfits. (0:30) NEW YORK --  Chris Paul kept dribbling through traffic, always trying to get to that old familiar spot from where he has punished opponents for 15 years. Every time he did, one of his teammates had the same thought. ""It's a bucket,"" reserve Abdel Nader said. ""He's been doing it all year, especially at the end of games."" Paul scored 20 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, leading the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 111-103 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night. The game was tied at 103 before Paul made consecutive mid-range jumpers, the shot he repeatedly knocked down in the fourth quarter. The Nets never scored again. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander closed out the scoring with four free throws, after making a jumper to open OT. Gilgeous-Alexander added 22 points for the Thunder, who bounced back from a loss Monday in Philadelphia to win for the sixth time in seven games. Steven Adams had 10 points and 18 rebounds as Oklahoma City wrapped up a 3-1 road trip without Danilo Gallinari, who rested a calf injury. ""We fought hard and we knew this was a big game,"" Paul said, ""and we always say you can't win them all without winning the first one or the second one or whatnot, and we wanted to go home 3-1. So, good win."" Taurean Prince scored 21 points and Caris LeVert had 20 in his second game back from right thumb surgery, but the Nets dropped their seventh straight. Spencer Dinwiddie had 14 points, but he struggled early and late in a 6 for 21 night. The Nets had a seven-point lead with under 3 1/2 minutes left in regulation before Paul scored 10 points in a 12-5 surge that tied it at 101 on his jumper with 47 seconds left. He lost the ball on a drive with 11 seconds remaining to give the Nets a chance, but Dinwiddie missed a free throw after getting fouled before the inbound pass, then was off on a short jumper before the buzzer. ""Obviously the two last shots are very disappointing because we had a chance to win. That's extremely disheartening,"" Dinwiddie said. ""My teammates trusted me to make those plays and I didn't. This one is on me for sure."" Prince made his first five shots, including four 3-pointers, but the Thunder got the better of it when the teams went to their benches and opened an eight-point lead in the second quarter before taking a 49-48 lead to the locker room. Dinwiddie, who started 0 for 7, and LeVert then scored eight apiece in the third, carrying Brooklyn to a 77-74 lead going to the final period. That was all ruined by 1-for-8 shooting in OT. ""We played some really good basketball. That's the shame about it,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""The defense was pretty good. Obviously, Chris Paul hit some tough, big shots at the end of the game. But we scored, I think, two points in overtime. Our offense is just not where it needs to be."" TIP-INS Thunder: Coach Billy Donovan said Gallinari was sore and he wanted to rest the forward for the busy month ahead. Oklahoma City plays 17 games in January and doesn't have a single stretch of more than one day off in between games. ... Dennis Schroder finished with 14 points but was just 5 for 15. Nets: Kyrie Irving missed his 25th straight game with his right shoulder injury. Coach Kenny Atkinson said he and his point guard are on the same page about the injury, even though Irving said Saturday he had bursitis in the shoulder and Atkinson had previously denied a report that he did. ... The Nets began a stretch of seven home games out of eight, and won't even require a flight for the lone road game, a trip to Philadelphia for a Jan. 15 game. RUSSELL'S RETURN Donovan wasn't ready to ponder the thoughts of a rested Russell Westbrook making his first trip back to Oklahoma City on Thursday. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni plans to rest Westbrook on Wednesday in Atlanta so he'll be fresh for the second night of a back-to-back. ""We're worried about Brooklyn right now,"" he said before the game. ""We'll cross that bridge when we get there."" TOO CHALLENGING? Donovan predicted that the coach's challenge, added this season on a one-year experimental basis, wouldn't return next season. He said it leaves coaches second-guessing themselves over when to use it, because they only get one even if their challenge was correct. ""My guess would be is you're probably going to have a lot of the league is going to vote to not have it, would be my guess,"" Donovan said.","401161192"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies youth movement was supposed to mean a rebuilding year. But, right now, they are sitting on the edge of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Dillon Brooks scored 28 points, Ja Morant added 25 and the Memphis rallied in the fourth quarter for a 119-112 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night. The win left the Grizzlies in the ninth spot, a half-game behind the San Antonio Spurs. Granted its early -- approaching the midway point of the season -- but most observers never expected Memphis, one of the league's youngest teams, to be in this position. But the win over Minnesota was the Grizzlies third straight and 10th in the last 16. ""We're going to take it one game at a time,"" said forward Jae Crowder, who had 14 points and eight rebounds. ""A young team, I don't want to get them too excited. Obviously, we are right where we need to be to gain ground in the playoffs."" Jaren Jackson Jr finished with 21 points, including a trio of 3-pointers in fourth after entering the period 1 for 7 over the first three quarters. He also recorded three blocks. Jackson, Morant and Brooks were the fourth-quarter catalysts as Memphis escaped an 8-point deficit in the final 7-plus minutes. Jackson had 11 down the stretch, while Brooks and Morant scored 10. The three were a combined 13 of 20 as Memphis overtook Minnesota outscoring the Wolves 37-28 in the fourth. ""Obviously, a great comeback win for us,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, later adding: ""We're just continuing to remind them of what we've built in the last month or so. It's a credit to them."" Rookie Jarrett Culver, the sixth overall pick in last summer's draft, led the Timberwolves with a career-high 24 points, converting 8 of 11 shots, 3 of 5 from outside the arc. Jeff Teague scored 18 points and handed out six assists for Minnesota, while Robert Covington scored 17 points. Andrew Wiggins had 15 points. ""They had a couple (of players) to get hot, and they spaced out the floor very well,"" Culver said. ""We still played hard. I feel like we missed a couple of rebounds that we could've gotten, but they made the plays at the end."" Memphis was able to grab five offensive rebounds in the final frame, leading to nine second-chance Grizzlies points. On two occasions as Memphis erased the lead, Morant and De'Anthony Melton tipped in their own misses. ""We've just got to do a better job of getting rebounds,"" Saunders said acknowledging the fourth-quarter offensive rebounds were a problem. The teams were still tied at the midway point of the fourth. At that point, Memphis built a six-point buffer behind baskets from Morant and a layup from Melton. Covington's 3-point play with 1:06 left pulled the Timberwolves within 113-112, but Minnesota could never catch Memphis the rest of the way, leaving the Grizzlies on the edge of the playoff conversation. ""Our team was counted out,"" Crowder said, ""and we're surprising people with wins here late. I just feel like once you take it one game at a time, you block out all the noise, you block out where you're at in the standings, you find yourself not looking as much and focusing on that one game."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: C. Karl-Anthony Towns missed his 11th straight game with left knee soreness. Asked if Towns was close, Saunders said: ""That would be the hope. He's progressing."" ... After a horrendous 11-game losing streak in December, the `Wolves had won four of their last six before Tuesday's loss. .Culver's previous career-high was 21 against Brooklyn on Dec. 30.

It was their third double-digit comeback win. ... Morant' 10 fourth-quarter points, marked the eighth time this season he's scored at least 10 in the final frame. FINAL WORD ""There's going to be doubters. There's going to be people who hop on once (we're) up. Everybody knows that. We're just focused on trying to get better."" -- Ja Morant on the Grizzlies play lately.","401161193"
"PHOENIX --  The Sacramento Kings pulled off quite the stunner when they recovered from a 21-point deficit in the third quarter to beat the Phoenix Suns 114-103 on Tuesday night. The players on the floor who made it happen were even more surprising. An unlikely lineup that included the disgruntled Dewayne Dedmon and veteran guard Trevor Ariza led the comeback, pushing the Kings to their second win in two nights and third out of four games. Both came off the bench, but Sacramento coach Luke Walton stuck with them in the game's most important minutes. Dedmon hasn't played much in recent weeks and was fined $50,000 by the NBA last week after making public comments about wanting a trade. He was forced into action on Tuesday because of a shoulder injury for Richaun Holmes and responded with 12 points and 10 rebounds. ""He stepped up,"" Kings guard Cory Joseph said of Dedmon. ""Everybody sees the game, but sometimes they don't see the work players put in behind the scenes. That's what he's been doing. He's been waiting for his moment and his moment was today. He executed and delivered for us."" The 30-year-old Dedmon signed a three-year, $40 million deal with the Kings during the offseason but came into the game averaging just 4.8 points and 3.8 rebounds. ""He's done a nice job of keeping himself ready,"" Walton said. ""He took full advantage today, played for his teammates just like that whole group did. They all made plays for each other and it was a lot of fun to coach."" Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox led the team with 27 points while Nemanja Bjelica added 19. Buddy Hield scored 16 points and Ariza had 15. The Kings trailed 83-62 with 4:25 remaining in the third but recovered in a hurry, rallying to take a 92-91 lead on Bjelica's dunk with about eight minutes left. The game was tight for the next several minutes but Fox hit a 3-pointer and then another jumper to push the Kings ahead 107-100 with 2:29 left. The Suns were led by Devin Booker, who scored 34 points and had seven assists. It was Booker's seventh straight game with at least 30 points, which extends his franchise record. The performance didn't stop the Suns from coughing up the big lead and losing their second straight game at home. ""This is about perseverance,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""We are not going to turn this thing around overnight. It just takes a lot of will. You cannot quit."" Deandre Ayton added 21 points and nine rebounds. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 17 points. The game was tied at 53 at halftime but the Suns started the second half on an 18-2 run and pushed their advantage to 21 points before settling for an 87-78 lead after three quarters. Things continued to spiral out of control in the fourth quarter for Phoenix, which has a 7-19 record after starting the season 7-4. ""We can't win against anyone if we don't compete for 48 minutes,"" Suns forward Aron Baynes said. ""But if we compete for 48 minutes, we can beat anyone."" The Kings were playing the second night of a back-to-back after beating the Warriors 111-98 on Monday. TIP-INS Kings: Forward Marvin Bagley III (left foot sprain), Holmes (right shoulder strain) and guard Bogdan Bogdanovic (right ankle soreness) didn't play. ... Because of the injuries, Harry Giles III made his first career start. He finished with eight points and eight rebounds. ... Fox led the Kings with 16 points in the first half. Suns: Forward Dario Saric scored five points in 18 minutes. His role has been reduced since Ayton came back to the lineup, but Williams said he wanted to get the 25-year-old more involved in the rotation. ... Ayton scored 14 points on 7-of-8 shooting in the first half. He also had eight rebounds.","401161194"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers gathered around Anthony Davis while the six-time All-Star writhed in pain on the Staples Center floor. Another breezy blowout win had just become much less fun for the Lakers and their superstar big man, although it's too soon to say just how serious it will be for their championship dreams. Davis left in the third quarter after bruising his lower back on a painful fall during the Lakers' sixth straight victory, 117-87 over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night. Davis bruised his sacrum -- the bottom part of his spine above the tailbone -- when he attempted to block Julius Randle's driving shot. He got knocked off balance and fell awkwardly to the court, landing hard on his back with 2:45 left in the third. The Lakers were anxious as they surrounded him under the basket. ""Fingers crossed, hope for the best, pray for the best,"" coach Frank Vogel said. Davis pounded the court in pain and stayed down for roughly two minutes, but eventually rose with his teammates' help and then slowly walked off unaided. ""We're hoping he'll be fine, and we believe he'll be fine,"" said LeBron James, who played through illness. ""Tough night for us."" X-rays were negative, but Davis didn't return to the game and he was scheduled for additional testing overnight. His agent, Rich Paul, said his client felt extremely sore. It seems quite likely Davis will miss at least a little playing time this month, given the Lakers' lofty record and the long road to the playoffs still ahead. The Lakers have a two-game road trip starting Friday in Dallas. ""We hope he's all right,"" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope said. ""We're just hoping he'll get better soon. We need him."" James scored 31 points and Caldwell-Pope added 15 after bouncing back from a flagrant foul to his head by Bobby Portis, but the Lakers (30-7) didn't exactly celebrate becoming the second NBA team to win 30 games this season. Davis, who will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, is the primary reason behind Los Angeles' swift rise to the top of the Western Conference. He is averaging 27.7 points and 9.5 rebounds per game in his first season after the Lakers traded most of their young core to New Orleans for him. ""He's one of our pillars,"" Vogel said. ""He's our present. He's our future. He's one of the best players in the world, so obviously he means a lot."" R.J. Barrett scored 19 points for the Knicks, and Randle had 15 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. New York dropped to 0-3 on its four-game West Coast trip. Los Angeles had little trouble holding off the Knicks in the second half despite Davis' abrupt exit. The Lakers pushed their lead to 30 early in the fourth quarter with a run led by James, who scored 16 points in 16 minutes in the second half. TIP-INS Knicks: Former Lakers forward Reggie Bullock started in place of Marcus Morris and scored seven points in 27 minutes. Morris sat out with a sore neck. ... Portis had two points on 1-of-5 shooting in six minutes. Lakers: James thought about sitting out after feeling sick all day, but elected to play. ... Avery Bradley scored 12 points despite sitting out the end of Sunday's game with an ankle injury. Bradley had no swelling and didn't need to miss a game, he said. ... The Lakers didn't win their 30th game last season until Feb. 27, when they were 30-31. FLAGRANT FOUL Portis was ejected early in the second quarter for a flagrant foul on Caldwell-Pope. Portis clocked Caldwell-Pope in the head while the Lakers veteran was going up for a fast-break dunk, knocking off his headband and sending him to the locker room. ""It wasn't intentional at all,"" Portis said. ""I went for the ball. My intent was never to hurt anybody or anything like that. Just trying to make a play on the ball. Missed the ball and hit him in the head. My apologies to Caldwell-Pope. Happy to see him go out and do his thing, come back into the game and impact the game."" Caldwell-Pope returned in the third quarter and scored eight more points. ""I was feeling great before I even came back on the court,"" he said. HERO TIME Barrett, the Knicks' 19-year-old rookie, got a thrill from playing against James: ""It was definitely cool. He was always my favorite player growing up, so that was good. But once I got in the game, it was a regular game now. Just got to play."" THE NEW 30 The Lakers joined the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks as the league's only 30-game winners so far this season. Los Angeles hadn't won 30 games this quickly since the 2008-09 season, when Kobe Bryant's Lakers started 30-6 and eventually won the 15th of their 16 NBA titles. DWIGHT'S ALL RIGHT Dwight Howard had another strong game with eight points, 13 rebounds and three blocked shots. The Lakers' veteran big man also hit the eighth 3-pointer of his career in the fourth quarter to much amusement from his teammates and fans.","401161195"
"BOSTON --  Kemba Walker was ejected for back-to-back profanities, a fan was arrested for throwing a beer can, and Gregg Popovich didn't feel much like hanging around, either. The San Antonio coach was understandably perturbed after the beer can sailed over the Spurs bench and landed on the court during a game-changing swing in Wednesday night's 129-114 victory over the Boston Celtics. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he apologized to the Spurs. Popovich spoke to reporters for 33 seconds, and did not address the incident. ""I told Pop after the game I'm really sorry that they had to experience that,"" Stevens said. ""I hope that person's not allowed in an NBA arena again."" DeMar DeRozan scored 30 points for San Antonio, which scored 22 of the game's first 25 points to drop the Celtics into their biggest hole of the season. Boston cut the deficit to 76-69 midway through the third, when Walker was knocked to the court on a hard pick by LaMarcus Aldridge. Walker rose from the court waving at the air, and approached referee Evan Scott. He got one technical and then -- as Spurs guard Patty Mills tried to hold him back -- got a second less than four seconds later. Stevens was also given a technical. ""In real time, it's a difficult play,"" crew chief Rodney Mott told a pool reporter. ""But we did deem the screen to be legal, as LaMarcus was set."" Both technicals were for profanity, Mott said. It was Walker's first ejection in his nine-year career. ""I thought I was being nice,"" said Walker, a two-time winner of the NBA's Joe Dumars Award for sportsmanship. ""I thought the ref missed the call. . The rest is history."" The game was delayed briefly while the court was cleaned up and the public address announcer asked the fans not to throw things. Celtics spokesman Christian Megliola said the fan who threw the can was promptly located and arrested; their identity was not immediately available. ""We can't have that,"" Boston forward Gordon Hayward said. ""I love our fans. I love our passion. But we've got to stay away from that."" The hubbub halted a 20-7 run that erased most of a 20-point deficit. Aldridge made two of the three technical foul shots and, when when he missed the third, Derrick White was fouled and made both free throws to give the Spurs an 80-69 lead. San Antonio soon went on an 11-0 run, and the Celtics never got within single digits again. ""That can energize the crowd, or energize the team,"" DeRozan said. ""We held on and did what we were supposed to do."" Lonnie Walker IV scored 19 points for the Spurs, who improved to 9-6 since Dec. 1, when they had a 7-14 record. San Antonio avoided what would have been the first season sweep by the Celtics since 2011. Hayward scored 18 points and Jaylen Brown had 16 for Boston, which has lost two in a row for just the third time this season. MINUTES RESTRICTION Walker was on an unspecified minutes restriction in his first game back after missing three with the flu. But he wound up playing just 18 minutes before he was tossed. He finished with six points, four assists and three rebounds. EARLY STRUGGLES The Celtics made one basket in the first seven minutes and trailed 22-3 before Enes Kanter hit a foul-line jumper to end a 14-0 run. It was 26-7 when Boston scored 11 of the next 13 points, and San Antonio went into the second quarter leading 34-22. It was 65-47 at halftime. TIP-INS Tacko Fall played the first first-half minutes of his career. He was in for 5 minutes, missing one shot and grabbing one rebound. ... Marcus Smart hit his 500th career 3-pointer ... Trey Lykes had seven points and three rebounds for San Antonio in the first quarter.","401161196"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Every now and again, Terence Davis reminds himself that 30 NBA teams passed on him in the 2019 draft. Wednesday was one of those nights. Davis made the most of his first NBA start with 23 points and 11 rebounds, Serge Ibaka made two free throws with 5.1 seconds left in overtime and also finished with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and the banged-up Toronto Raptors escaped with a 112-110 overtime win over Charlotte Hornets. Davis said going undrafted wasn't ideal, but ""it adds fuel to the fire."" ""I told my family when I didn't get drafted, `Hey, those guys that got their name called still have to lace them up and go play in the Summer League,"" Davis said. ""... So did I. That was my mindset going into the draft night was just to get to the Summer League."" Davis said he was ""surprised"" when coach Raptors coach Nick Nurse told him before the game he was going to start. The Raptors were without Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam, Marc Gasol, Dewan Hernandez and Norman Powell due to injuries, leaving them depleted on the second night of a back-to-back. ""He was really good,"" Nurse said of Davis. ""This isn't that easy to figure out who to play with all these guys out constantly and trying to figure out some ways to keep guys ticking. When they are really fighting hard for minutes they play better. .... There are all kinds of things going on, but with me I am going to rattle your cage if you deserve to have it rattled."" Davis picked up the slack for the Raptors, getting into a rhythm early with 13 points in the first quarter. The rookie from Mississippi also finished strong with two big 3-pointers in overtime. ""I was being aggressive without trying to force things,"" said Davis, a second-team All-Southeastern Conference selection last season. ""Guys were finding me and I knocked a couple shots down and got to the paint."" OG Anunoby added 19 points and Kyle Lowry had 15 points and nine assists while having to play 43 minutes due to injuries in the backcourt. Patrick McCaw added 13 points and 11 assists as the Raptors bounced back from a home loss to Portland on Tuesday night. Terry Rozier led the Hornets with 27 points, but his 3-pointer at the buzzer in overtime that would have won the game fell just short. Rozier exchanged words and pointed fingers at Davis on the court after the game and the two had to be separated by teammates before heading back to their respective locker rooms. Both players declined to discuss what was said after the game. Miles Bridges added 26 points and nine rebounds for Charlotte, and P.J. Washington had 12 points and 12 rebounds. This was a much different game than on Nov. 18 when Toronto defeated Charlotte 132-96 at home. After leading by as many as 12 in the third quarter, the Raptors fell behind by 10 in the fourth quarter when Rozier hit a long 3 from the left wing with 5:25 remaining. But the Raptors battled back to take the lead 100-99 with 17 seconds left when Lowry drove the lane and scored on a left-handed layup in traffic. On the Hornets' ensuing inbounds pass, Ibaka was called for a foul away from the ball after grabbing Washington's jersey. Rozier sank the automatic free throw to tie it, but Devonte Graham's runner at the buzzer was short, sending the game into overtime. Ibaka scored the game's go-ahead points after grabbing an offensive rebound and drawing a foul on Rozier. Hornets coach James Borrego said he thought Ibaka might have traveled on the play, but added he would have to watch the film to be sure. ""You have to keep playing for 48 minutes and that's the bottom line,"" Borrego said. ""No matter if you're up or down, you have to keep playing."" TIP INS Raptors: Had 34 assisted baskets. ... Davis was 8 of 16 from the field in his first start. Hornets: Bench outscored Raptors' reserves 28-19 despite only playing eight players overall. ROZIER STAYS HOT Rozier has scored at least 27 points in four straight games for the Hornets. He started slow against the Raptors, but picked up the pace in the second half and in overtime, where he made a series of big plays, including a steal and an assist for Devonte Graham for a transition 3-pointer. ""I think he came back with a vengeance,"" Borrego said. ""He was terrific down the stretch. He had great will, just to chase down that transition possession for them was fantastic. He kept attacking the rim. He got to the rim. I liked the ball in his hands late."" BACK-TO-BACK PROWESS The Raptors have not lost on back-to-back nights since Dec. 26-27, 2017. Lowry attributed that to the team's resiliency. ""We played hard and Coach Nurse has a good mentality,"" Lowry said. ""We have a lot of guys hurt right now and we got some guys coming back and we will just keep plugging away."" BRIDGES OVER TROUBLED WATERS Bridges knocked down a career-high six 3-pointers. ""I wasn't hesitating on the shots and the last few games I was hesitating,"" Bridges said. ""I was just shooting them.""","401161197"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- The Miami Heat were irritated ahead of their game against Indiana after coach Erik Spoelstra categorized his team as ""mediocre"" on the road. An altercation in the third quarter elevated the Heat's game even more. In the midst of the Heat's outscoring the Pacers 38-23 in the third quarter on the way to a 122-108 rout, Jimmy Butler exchanged bumps, words and gestures with Indiana's T.J. Warren, who was ejected. Afterward, Warren said nothing. Butler didn't hesitate to speak his mind. ""I mean, to me, I think it's tough for him because I can guard him, and he can't guard me,"" Butler said. ""At the end of the day, that's what it comes down to. I think you just gotta watch your mouth in certain situations. Some s--- you just don't say as a man. He gotta see me the next time because I feel like what he said was truly disrespectful, and it's all good 'cause we see him again."" Butler blew kisses to Warren after the latter's ejection. ""He's soft,"" Butler said. ""He's not even in my f---ing league. Nowhere near me. If I was their coach, I would never put him on me. Ever again. ... He's trash."" The Heat had little trouble handling the Pacers. Butler scored 14 points and was one of seven Miami players in double figures. Another was Bam Adebayo, who had 18 points in three quarters. The Heat improved to 10-9 in road games. ""It was a real big emphasis because Coach called us 'mediocre' on the road,"" Adebayo said. ""We didn't appreciate that. We tried to prove him wrong."" The Heat built a 28-point lead by the end of the third quarter and rested their starters. ""It wasn't about me or my message,"" Spoelstra said. ""It was about this team taking ownership of what we've done so far on the road. Nobody has felt great about that in the locker room, and one of the qualities of this team has been to own things we haven't been doing well and try to correct it."" Tyler Herro led Miami with 19 points, Derrick Jones Jr. had 18, and Duncan Robinson scored 11 of his 17 in the third quarter. Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn each scored 14. ""That's how this team is built,"" Spoelstra said. ""That's how our best player [Butler] is wired. It's fun basketball to be a part of if everybody can embrace it -- that it could be multiple guys, different guys on different nights, and it doesn't necessarily have to be one guy with a high usage rate. Jimmy really facilitates this kind of attitude, and it permeates throughout the team."" The Pacers were led by forward Domantas Sabonis, with 27 points and 14 rebounds for his 30th double-double of the season. ""Just collectively as a unit, they controlled this game from the start,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. OLADIPO TARGETS JAN. 29 RETURN Two-time All-Star Pacers guard Victor Oladipo confirmed that the plan for his season debut is a Jan. 29 home game against Chicago, which will mark a little more than a year since he ruptured a right quadriceps tendon in a Jan. 23, 2019, home victory over Toronto. ""I think waiting a year was good for me,"" he said Wednesday. ""I think the date is good, something I'm going to look forward to."" A healthy Oladipo could elevate the Pacers to among the Eastern Conference's elite. Without him, they recently defeated defending champion Toronto, as well as LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers at home. The sixth-year pro was averaging 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 36 games before the injury. ""I'm just looking forward to going out there and playing basketball again,"" he said. ""It's what I love to do. ... It's been a crazy journey. It's been a tough journey, but it's molded me into a better person. I truly believe that."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami has won two games in 12 days against Pacers after losing four in a row last season. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic got a big win to sweep the season series against a Southeast Division rival just before leaving for their longest road trip of the season. Nikola Vucevic scored 29 points, Evan Fournier added 19, and the Magic beat Washington 123-89 on Wednesday night to secure their first sweep of the Wizards since 2010-11. Orlando took control for good with a 23-5 run to close the second quarter, punctuated by a dunk by Vucevic in the final seconds, for a 69-52 lead. ""When you get a lead early, and the zone (defense) slows the game down, you can lose your concentration, lose your intensity,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""I thought our guys did a good job."" The advantage ballooned to 29 points in the early stages of the third quarter. ""Runs happen all the time. Things turn around quickly. In the position we are, we can't afford to relax against a team like that,"" Vucevic added. ""We were efficient offensively, and on the defensive end, we got some steals and got some easy baskets that opened the game up."" The Wizards played with a short bench, as a rash of injuries left them with only nine players available. Bradley Beal, the star guard who averaged 34.3 points in the previous three games against Orlando, sat out for the fourth consecutive game since injuring his right leg against the Magic in Washington on Jan. 1. Admiral Schofield scored 18 points to lead the Wizards, and Troy Brown, Jr. had 16 points and 11 rebounds. ""That's two games in a row we played this team a step slow,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We were dribbling one extra dribble and late on our passes. When you play this team, you've got to be on point. (The Magic are) a good team that I think now is starting to play much better."" TIP-INS: Wizards: After playing in 194 consecutive games, Beal has now missed six of Washington's last seven due to injury. . Washington was also without Rui Hachimura (groin), Thomas Bryant (foot), and Davis Bertans (quadriceps). ... Clifford's reaction to long list of Wizards injuries: ""I don't think I've ever seen a team with that many starters or guys in their rotation be out at the same time like this."" Magic: F Jonathan Isaac will not need surgery for the knee sprain he suffered on Jan. 1 at Washington. Isaac will be re-evaluated in 8 to 10 weeks. ... F Al-Farouq Aminu underwent surgery on Tuesday to repair a torn right meniscus. He will be re-evaluated in approximately 12 weeks, meaning he could be available for the latter stages of the regular season and a potential playoff run. WIZ KIDS Vucevic's 29 points were one shy of his season high. He scored 30 in a 125-121 win against Washington on Nov. 17. Orlando's 69 point outburst in the first half was its best output in the first half of any game this season, eclipsing the 68 it scored in a 127-120 win over the Wizards on Dec. 3. The Magic scored 120 or more points in all four of their games against Washington. ""Now I have a little leverage to talk trash to some of my friends back home who are die-hard Wizards fans,"" said Magic G Markelle Fultz, a native of Maryland's D.C. suburbs. ""That's huge.""","401161199"
"ATLANTA --  James Harden's big first quarter gave Houston a lead that seemed safe. His misses helped give Atlanta a chance. Harden scored 41 points, including 22 in the first quarter, to lead the Houston Rockets over Trae Young and the Hawks 122-115 on Wednesday night. Harden had 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his second straight triple-double. He made only 9 of 34 shots, including 4 of 20 3-pointers. Young kept pace. The Hawks' second-year point guard had 42 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. He and Harden are the first players to post 40-point triple-doubles in the same game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Harden faded in the second half, when he made only 2 of 18 shots. ""I think, obviously, we had a couple guys run out of gas,"" said Houston coach Mike D'Antoni. ""... Our legs got tired obviously. We just had to hang on."" D'Antoni said Harden ""just didn't shoot the ball well. So be it."" Harden had 44 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for his first triple-double of the season in a 118-108 win over Philadelphia on Friday night. The Hawks pulled within three late in the fourth quarter, the last time at 118-115 on two free throws by Alex Len. Harden sank four free throws in the final 10.4 seconds. ""They made shots,"" Harden said. ""We missed shots. They're a feisty team."" Clint Capela had 22 points and 22 rebounds, and Ben McLemore had 18 points in Houston's third straight win. Harden more than made up for the absence of Russell Westbrook, his usual backcourt partner. D'Antoni had a confident answer when asked before the game about the impact of Westbrook being rested. ""Just more James,"" D'Antoni said. It was a safe prediction. Harden, who scored 60 points in his last game against Atlanta in November, set out on another high-scoring pace. The NBA's leader at 38.4 points per game, Harden abused the Hawks with his mix of 3-pointers and drives. Atlanta's frequent best answer was to foul him, and he made 19 of 23 free throws. Houston led 45-29 after the first quarter and pushed the lead to 20 in the second period. The Hawks rallied in the third, cutting the Houston lead to 87-83. Following Houston's timeout, Harden sank a 3-pointer to start a 12-2 run to close the period, pushing the lead back to double figures. McLemore had two 3s in the run. Atlanta again pulled close in the final period. Len's three-point play pulled the Hawks to 108-105. TIP-INS Rockets: Eric Gordon had 17 points in his fourth game back after missing 22 games. He had arthroscopic knee surgery on Nov. 13. ... The 45 first-quarter points wasn't the high mark for any quarter this season. Houston scored 46 third-quarter points in the first win over Atlanta and had 48 fourth-quarter points at Washington on Oct. 30. Hawks: John Collins had 17 points and 14 rebounds. ... The triple-double was Young's second this season and third of his career. ... F Bruno Fernando, who had been listed as a starter, was held out for personal reasons. Cam Raddish moved into the starting lineup. ... After missing four straight games with a right shoulder impingement, F Jabari Parker will be re-evaluated in two weeks following a non-surgical procedure on the shoulder on Tuesday. Parker is Atlanta's third-leading scorer with 15 points per game. REASON FOR HOPE The Hawks have the NBA's worst record (8-30) but Young said it is ""super exciting to see"" the team's effort against Houston. ""We've got a lot of our guys back healthy,"" Young said. ""We just have to figure out how to close out games."" APPRECIATING CAPELA Harden said Capela's stat line didn't tell the whole story of his contribution, especially on defense. ""He does that every night,"" Harden said. ""He doesn't get credit for it. He guards the best player every single night.""","401161200"
"DALLAS --  All it took for Nikola Jokic to get going were a few words of encouragement from Denver Nuggets coach Mike Malone at halftime. Jokic scored 26 of his 33 points in the second half and Denver pulled out a 107-106 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night to finish 3-2 on its longest road trip of the season. Jokic had 21 points in the third quarter and delivered the winning basket with 7.9 seconds left in the fourth when he backed down on the right side of the lane and got a favorable bounce on his left-handed layup. Jokic, who was coming off a career-high 47 points Monday in a win over Atlanta, scored his first points of this one with 4:31 to play in the first half. ""No, I didn't get on him: `You've got to score 26 points this half,"" Malone said. ""It was more, `Just stay with it.' He got really good looks in the first half. `Didn't go down for you. We're going to keep on going to you."" The Mavericks' final possession ended with an errant pass that eluded Tim Hardaway Jr. behind the 3-point line. Luka Doncic led Dallas with 27 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds -- one rebound short of his 12th triple-double of the season. The Mavericks played their fifth straight game without Kristaps Porzingis (right knee soreness), who is second on the team in scoring and rebounding. ""The game wasn't lost at the end,"" Hardaway said. ""It was lost in the first, second, third and little parts of the fourth. You've got to give them credit because they knocked down their contested 3s and Jokic got hot."" The Nuggets were 9 for 24 behind the arc, led by Jokic going 4 for 6. Dallas shot 12 for 35 on 3-pointers. Doncic was 1 for 7 from long range. After Jokic missed his only three shots of the first quarter and had seven points at halftime, he got rolling quickly. ""I missed a couple easy ones in the first half,"" Jokic said. ""My teammates were passing me the ball and telling me to shoot. I was just trying to be aggressive and score as much as possible."" The Nuggets were down two starters. Will Barton, second on the team in rebounding, missed the game for personal reasons. Paul Millsap sat out with a bruised left knee. Their substitutes in the lineup were Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig, each making his fourth start of the season. The Mavericks are 2-2 on a six-game homestand, their longest of the season. They have lost five of their last eight home games. TIP-INS After the Nuggets allowed only four offensive rebounds in their eight-point win over the Hawks, they limited the Mavericks to six. ... The teams alternated six 3-pointers in the final 2:01 of the third quarter, leaving the Mavericks ahead 89-86 going into the fourth. ... Doncic went into play leading the NBA in first-quarter scoring at 9.9 points per game. He scored nine this time on 4-for-11 shooting, including 1 of 4 on 3-pointers while playing the entire period. COLD FINISH Doncic, the NBA's third-leading scorer at 29.6 points per game, was held scoreless in the fourth quarter, going 0 for 3 from the floor with one 3-point attempt and no free throws. ""Just put pressure on him, make him give the ball up early,"" Denver guard Jamal Murray said. ""We trust our rotation to the last play, and it was working. We did a great job of just being active on defense."" ON THE BOARDS With Porzingis out, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle sought rebounding help from wherever he could find it. The Mavericks finished with a 38-37 edge over an opponent that is 17-2 when outrebounding its opposition. Dwight Powell had eight boards and reserve Maxi Kleber grabbed seven. With the Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers coming to town Friday and Saturday, respectively, Carlisle had no update on when Porzingis might return. ""He's doing better every day,"" Carlisle said. ""His activity's increasing every day.""","401161201"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Between his driving tomahawk jams and 3-pointers, Brandon Ingram tossed an alley-oop lob to rookie center Jackson Hayes and found Derrick Favors cutting into the lane for a transition dunk. Ingram had 29 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans defeated Chicago 123-108 on Wednesday night to drop the Bulls to a fifth straight loss. ""Just coming in and trying to do everything that I work on in practice in my routines,"" Ingram said. ""My teammates have been doing a really, really good job of just being the best version of themselves. They help me out so much and we just mesh together so well."" The game merely added to the career season Ingram, now in his fourth season out of Duke, has been putting together since being traded by the Lakers as part of a pre-draft deal that sent Anthony Davis to Los Angeles. In addition to being only a point shy of his ninth 30-point game this season, Ingram was just two rebounds short of his first career triple-double. ""As long as we got the win is all that matters,"" Ingram said, forecasting that his next chance to hit double digits in three main statistical categories will ""come back again soon."" JJ Redick hit six 3-pointers on his way to 24 points, while Hayes had 14 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks to help the Pelicans win for the seventh time in 10 games. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said Hayes had ""one of this better games, really, overall from the standpoint of trying to do exactly what we ask him to do."" The 6-foot-11 Hayes also continued to rev up the crowd with his above the rim athleticism, be it on a transition dunk or his rejection of Coby White's layup attempt in the final seconds of the third quarter. ""The spectacular plays are really what fans like to see and he's a guy that's a great leaper, he blocks some shots, he'll have a dunk every now and then,"" Gentry continued. ""But we talk to him about being solid and doing exactly what we're supposed to do defensively."" Zach LaVine scored 32 for the Bulls, who are in the midst of their longest losing streak this season. Thaddeus Young scored 18 in his return to the city where he was born. Chicago led by six early in the third quarter before New Orleans went on a 15-3 run that put the Pelicans in front for good. Ingram scored nine during that surge, starting it with a 3, adding another from deep and then hitting three free throws after he was fouled on a 3-point attempt. The Bulls have been vulnerable to third-quarter lapses this season, and Chicago forward Kris Dunn seemed to think the issue is more mental and emotional than schematic. ""We've got to be men about it. It is basketball. It is a game of runs,"" said Dunn, who scored 15 points. ""Things happen and you have to be able to withstand it and fight through adversity."" But there was little fight left in the Bulls by the fourth quarter, when New Orleans widened its lead to as many as 21 points. ""It was disappointing,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""We missed a few assignments and they went on a roll and we couldn't recover."" TIP-INS Bulls: Lauri Markkanen scored 14. ... LaVine scored at least 25 for the 19th time this season and eclipsed 30 for the ninth time. ... The Bulls came in forcing league best 18.3 turnovers per game and failed to hit that mark against New Orleans, which committed 14 turnovers. ... Chicago had 10 offensive rebounds, the ninth straight game it had at least that many. Pelicans: Were without guard Jrue Holiday (left elbow bruise), the club's second-leading scorer (19.6 points per game) for a second straight game. ...

DEJA VU For a second straight game, Hayes and fellow rookie Alexander-Walker ran a pick-and-roll on the right side of the floor that resulted in Alexander-Walker floating up an alley-oop lob that Hayes dunked. Against Utah on Monday night, Hayes finished by grabbing the ball with his right hand and slamming it down in one motion. Against the Bulls, he caught it while twisting in the air and finished with a two-handed reverse jam. ""It's exciting,"" Alexander-Walker said.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Emmanuel Mudiay has never lacked confidence, though the former seventh overall draft pick knew he could get better. Mudiay scored a season-high 20 points against his former team and Rudy Gobert added 16 points and 16 rebounds to power the Utah Jazz to a 128-104 win over the short-handed New York Knicks on Wednesday night. ""I thought I was a pretty smart player until I came here. Everybody told me what kind of coach Quin (Snyder) was before I came here, so I bought in from day one,"" said Mudiay, who believes his basketball IQ has risen a few points. Despite averaging a career high 14.8 points for the New York Knicks last season, the improvements and nuanced touches he's added to his game were all on display against the Knicks. ""He didn't force himself on the game. More than anybody, he played the right way. He made good decisions,"" Snyder said. Mudiay played for the Knicks last season before signing with the Jazz in the summer and ""playing the right way"" wasn't a common descriptor of Mudiay's game. He figured he'd be the backup in Utah but he came to get coached. Against New York, he made 8 of 12 shots, added four assists and played solid defense. ""I now know when to get my own and when to get everybody involved. I think that's what a point guard needs to do,"" Mudiay said. Bojan Bogdanovic also scored 20 points and Donovan Mitchell had 16 in limited minutes for Utah, which has won seven straight and 12 of 13. ""For (Mudiay), it's just a matter of taking his time being patient. He's always aggressive getting to the rim. But now he's finding guys too,"" Mitchell said. Frank Ntilikina had 16 points in 19 minutes and Bobby Portis added 13 points and a season-high 13 rebounds for New York. The Jazz are making the most of a soft stretch of the schedule where most opponents are under .500, but none have been quite as hapless as the current Knicks. Portis was fined $25,000 by the NBA earlier Wednesday for recklessly making contact above the shoulders of an airborne shooter in the Knicks' 117-87 loss at the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. He started against Utah as leading scorer Julius Randle missed the game for personal reasons and, again, was whistled for a flagrant foul. This time it was ruled a Flagrant Foul 1 as he whacked Bogdanovic across the forehead on his way to the basket. Marcus Morris was out with a sore neck and Dennis Smith Jr. sat with an oblique strain, decimating the Knick bench. On a back-to-back and last game of a four-game road trip -- all losses -- the Knicks looked tired and outmatched. ""We're in the mountains. You can't breathe,"" RJ Barrett said. Behind Gobert's 14 points and nine rebounds in the first half, the Jazz sprinted to a 72-53 at the break and were never challenged the rest of the way. ""We had difficulty getting to spots at times, obviously, and I give them credit. Their defense was good. They dictated a lot of those things,"" New York interim coach Mike Miller said. Since Miller implemented more spacing and a quicker pace, the Knicks are scoring efficiently, even scoring 132 in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on this trip and 143 against the Atlanta Hawks three weeks ago. However, there are glaring problems on the defensive side as the Jazz shredded the step-slow Knicks with a constant series of screens and ball movement. BASKETBALL GODS WILL BLESS ""If you play the right way, the basketball gods are going to bless you,"" Mudiay said. Though Utah has thrived on good defense to win the past few seasons, the offense has now come around. ""The detail is there now, the accuracy. We're throwing strikes . it's all the little things, using foot fakes and shot fakes,"" Snyder said. ""The result is you play more efficiently and play with more precision."" Pinpoint passes and tight movement has refined the offense and led to wide open shots and Mitchell said, ""That's what we expected would happen with time and we should only get better from here. Eight Jazz players were in double figures and the reserves' 57 points were a season best. TIP-INS Knicks: New York is 0-19 when it is outrebounded as Utah had 50 to the Knicks' 41 boards. ... The Knicks only attempted 11 free throws but made all of them. ... Elfrid Payton scored nine of his 13 points in the first quarter. Jazz: Utah shot better from the field (65.0%) than the line (57.9%) in the first half. ... PG Mike Conley is still out with a sore hamstring. ... The Jazz outscored the Knicks in the paint 60-38.","401161203"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  The Milwaukee Bucks own the best record in the NBA and coach Mike Budenholzer still wants far more than what he has seen the past two games. More made shots. More pace. More energy. Better ball movement, too. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 12 rebounds while leading four Milwaukee starters in double figures, and the NBA-best Bucks held off the Golden State Warriors 107-98 on Wednesday night. ""Sometimes you've got to find a way to win kind of the ugly games, and I'm proud of the group for doing that,"" Budenholzer said. ""... We made just enough plays."" Khris Middleton added 21 points, seven rebounds and six assists as Milwaukee -- with the NBA's best record at 33-6 -- bounced back with a hard-fought victory against the young Warriors after having its five-game winning streak snapped in a 126-104 loss at San Antonio on Monday. Alec Burks scored 19 points and Glenn Robinson III and Damion Lee added 15 points apiece for the cold-shooting Warriors, who lost their sixth straight game and third in a row at home. Willie Cauley-Stein contributed 10 points and 11 rebounds. Draymond Green was back for Golden State after sitting out Monday with a sprained right ankle and had five points on 1-for-7 shooting, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""Our pace was not great in the first half and it picked up in the second half,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I thought we were a little tentative in the first half. They're a great team, obviously the best team in the league and the best defense in the league."" The Bucks overcame a cold shooting performance of 40.2% to win their third straight game on Golden State's home floor, playing for the first time at new Chase Center on Wednesday. Antetokounmpo notched his league-leading 32nd double-double after continuing to deal with a sore back. He shot 1 for 7 on 3-pointers and converted 9 of 13 free throws. KERR FINED Kerr was fined $25,000 by the NBA on Wednesday for verbally abusing a game official and failing to leave the court in a timely manner following an ejection. Kerr was ejected late in the second quarter of the Warriors' 111-98 road loss to the Sacramento Kings on Monday night after getting hit with consecutive technical fouls by referee Jason Goldenberg. Kerr appeared initially upset about a continuation call that went the Kings' way, then erupted after Golden State did not receive a similar call. He angrily walked onto the court after the second technical and yelled at Goldenberg before leaving. ""I took my punishment and try to move on,"" Kerr said. TWO-WAY LEADERS Warriors two-way players Ky Bowman and Lee have been counted on so heavily they are down to their final days of permitted NBA service time, with Bowman scheduled to return to Santa Cruz of the G League and Lee expected to be signed on soon to stay with Golden State. He had one remaining available day after Wednesday. Bowman will go back once D'Angelo Russell is healthy to return. That had been expected to be Monday at Sacramento but he sat out that one and then missed a fifth straight game Wednesday with a bruised right shoulder. Golden State has the most points by its two-way players of any team with 580. ""We are just like the drunken sailor with fifty bucks left in his pocket,"" Kerr said, ""we are going to spend it until it runs out and figure it out from there.""

"Stephen A. Smith and Jay Williams have a heated discussion about John Beilein's controversial comments during the Cavs film session. (2:15) DETROIT --  Tristan Thompson and the Cleveland Cavaliers finished a tumultuous couple days with an emotional victory. However they felt about what had unfolded between them and coach John Beilein, the Cavaliers kept playing hard. Thompson scored a career-high 35 points with 14 rebounds, and Kevin Love made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 37.9 seconds left in overtime to lift Cleveland to a 115-112 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night. The Cavaliers snapped a five-game losing streak, rallying from a 13-point third-quarter deficit. Beilein said earlier Thursday that he'd apologized for his comments during a film session the previous day. ESPN.com, citing unidentified sources, reported that Beilein suggested during a Wednesday film session his players were no longer playing ""like a bunch of thugs."" Beilein said he meant to say ""slugs"" in reference to the team's effort level. Although Beilein said the response to his explanation and apology had been positive, it was anyone's guess how the Cavaliers would play. ""We motivate each other, at the end of the day -- especially myself and Kev,"" Thompson said. ""It's on us to motivate our teammates. Coach's job is to give us the scout and the game plan, but we don't need no coaches at all to motivate us. Us as players, we motivate each other."" With the score tied at 110, Love got open in the left corner and connected from long range to put the Cavaliers ahead to stay. Thompson got free for a dunk with 16.7 seconds remaining to push the lead to five. Detroit had one last chance after forcing a turnover, but Derrick Rose missed a 3-pointer in the final seconds. Rose also missed a jumper at the end of regulation that could have won it. Beilein downplayed the idea that this victory was extra special because of the previous 48 hours. ""The past couple days are part of today's world,"" Beilein said. ""It is great to get a win for these guys right there, and that's all it's really about."" There was no question the Cavaliers were in an upbeat mood in the locker room afterward. ""Usually, you go into a college locker room, and everybody's jumping around. Pro locker room, everybody's chilling after a win,"" Beilein said. ""That locker room was hopping around right now -- everybody was really excited."" Andre Drummond had 28 points and 23 rebounds for Detroit. The Pistons are without star forward Blake Griffin, who had surgery on his left knee. The Cavaliers rallied from their double-digit deficit and took a brief lead at 91-90 in the fourth. Detroit answered with nine straight points, but Cleveland battled back again, and it was tied at 102 at the end of regulation. ""We just didn't play the right way in the second half. We allowed them to get a rhythm going,"" Drummond said. ""We allowed them to get some steam."" ROSTER MOVE The Cavaliers signed F Alfonzo McKinnie to a 10-day contract. He scored four points and made an impact defensively. ""That's (assistant) J.B. Bickerstaff. We wanted him in there for defense, but he was the one with, `Let's put him on Rose,"" Beilein said. ""He does most of our substitutions and our matchups, and I never would have thought of that one."" GOING INSIDE Cleveland went just 5 of 20 from 3-point range, and Love's late 3 was the only one the Cavaliers made after the end of the third quarter. Collin Sexton made only one 3 but finished with 19 points and six rebounds. Darius Garland had 20 points and seven assists. ""It felt good to get a win for our team, as well as coach,"" Sexton said.

"Adrian Wojnarowski reveals that the 76ers and Joel Embiid have announced that Embiid will have surgery on the torn ligament in his left hand and details a possible timetable for his return. (0:44) PHILADELPHIA --  Brett Brown gathered his team in the locker room to ring the postgame victory bell when the 76ers coach noticed a familiar face on general manager Elton Brand's phone. There was Joel Embiid on FaceTime, calling in from New York where he's set to have surgery Friday to repair a torn ligament. Embiid had to like the view -- a Sixers team that gutted out a win hours after learning the All-Star center was out indefinitely. ""We're going to miss Joel for however long it is,"" guard Ben Simmons said, ""but tonight was a good start."" Josh Richardson scored 29 points, Simmons had 19 and Philadelphia won without Embiid, beating the Boston Celtics 109-98 on Thursday night. Embiid will have surgery for a torn ligament in a finger in his left hand and will be evaluated in one to two weeks. Embiid, averaging 23.4 points and 12.3 rebounds in 31 games this season, tore the radial collateral ligament in the ring finger Monday night in a victory over Oklahoma City. ""I'm putting a blow torch, a bullet, many bullets into what we used to do,"" Brown said. ""Really. It doesn't fit. So it's on me to make it fit. We don't have Joel Embiid. So when I say, 'blow torch and bullet,' I mean it."" Mike Scott slid into the starting rotation, along with Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Richardson and Simmons. Simmons, an All-Star point guard, played center at times and drew a charge on Enes Kanter with 1:45 left in the first quarter. ""I've always been curious of what that could look like,"" Brown said. ""I thought he was good. I don't know what the numbers bear out but it's something we tried. I have wanted to try Ben at five, we did, and I suspect we'll see it again."" With Embiid out indefinitely, even the deep reserves are going to have to contribute to keep them afloat until he returns. That included Furkan Korkmaz, who buried a 3 late in the fourth that stretched the Sixers' lead to 91-87. Horford, who left Boston in the offseason to sign a four-year deal with Philadelphia, converted a three-point play for a seven-point lead. The Celtics pulled within two, but the Sixers used a 9-0 run to put the game away and improve to 18-2 at home. ""It's two big sports cities that really get behind their teams, so you appreciate that,"" Richardson said. ""I feel like everybody's almost ready to fight about that game when it comes up."" The Celtics had their own injury scare when Kemba Walker, ejected for the first time in his nine-year NBA career a night earlier, sprained his left thumb. Walker ran into Scott and instantly clutched his hand late in the second quarter. Walker, who scored 26 points on 10-for-20 shooting, tried to shake it off but left for the locker room shortly before the Celtics took a 55-48 lead into halftime. Walker, wearing a wrap in the locker room, said he jammed his thumb and didn't think he would need additional tests. ""When he first went down, we were worried about ligaments,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""Right now, in a lot of ways, it feels like we dodged a bullet."" Walker looked fine when he returned to the lineup. Jayson Tatum and Walker hit back-to-back 3s to tie the game at 69-all in the third and wipe out a hole caused by the Sixers' 11-0 run to start the half. ""We just have to close out games better,"" Walker said. ""You can't win 'em all, obviously. But we've got to be better."" TIP-INS Celtics: Smart hit his 500th career 3-pointer. He also hit a 3 to close the third and give the Celtics an 80-77 lead. 76ers: F Matisse Thybulle returned from a nine-game absence with a sprained right knee. The rookie averaged 4.8 points before he was hurt. NEED FOR EMBIID The 25-year-old Embiid has struggled with injuries ever since he was drafted with the No. 3 pick of the 2014 draft. He missed his first two seasons with foot injuries and hasn't played more than 64 games in any of the last three. They're 4-4 this season when Embiid sits out. ""This is not a 'woe is me' moment, not for me, at all,"" Brown said. ""And not for my players. We'll take what we have, and what we have, I love."" LOSING THREE The Celtics are on their first three-game losing streak of the season and have lost all three games to the Sixers this season. ""I'm just not as discouraged as I've been the last couple of days,"" Stevens said.","401161206"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  With Karl-Anthony Towns sidelined for nearly a month, the Minnesota Timberwolves have had to find ways to make up for his scoring. They've also tightened things up on the defensive end in their star big mans absence. That was certainly the case again Thursday night against Portland. Andrew Wiggins scored 23 points, Gorgui Dieng had 12 points and 10 rebounds and Minnesota shut down the Trail Blazers 116-102. Minnesota smothered the Trail Blazers all night. The Timberwolves held Portland to 13 points on 6-of-22 shooting in the second quarter, the fewest points the Blazers have scored in a quarter this year. We have discovered our identity that our defense is going to carry us, said Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie, who had two steals and two blocks. Thats just what we have to be every night. Damian Lillard led Portland with 20 points and eight of the teams 14 assists. CJ McCollum and Hassan Whiteside each added 15 points. Thursday was the last game of a five-game trip for Portland. Overall we were a little bit tired, Lillard said. It's usually like that at the end of the trip, when you know you're going home after the game, been on the road for a long time and we just didn't have the kind of energy that we needed tonight. The Timberwolves took control with a big run to start the second quarter. Led by Keita Bates-Diop and Wiggins, Minnesota used a 20-4 run to turn an eight-point deficit into a 46-38 lead. The Wolves lead grew to as much as 27 in the third, allowing coach Ryan Saunders to play his backups for the entire fourth quarter. They gained the momentum right at the start of the third quarter, and all of a sudden it's a 20-point game, Portland coach Terry Stotts said. It is pretty deflating when that happens. Minnesota entered Thursdays game with the best defensive rating in the league since Dec. 26 and was holding opponents to an average of 103.6 points. That defense was on display against Portland in the second quarter. The Wolves had four steals -- two by Robert Covington -- and turned four Portland turnovers into eight points during the dominant second quarter. Minnesota outscored the Blazers 31-13 in the second to take a 59-47 lead. Were a better offensive team when we defend, Saunders said. We had a number of guys step up. Holding a team like that to 13 points in a quarter, thats a big credit to that locker room. Minnesota put up 41 points in the third quarter as the Timberwolves went on cruise control. Wiggins scored nine of his 23 points in the third. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland returns home after going 2/3 on a five-game trip.  Whiteside was listed as questionable prior to the game because of an upper respiratory illness but started for the Blazers.  Lillard has topped 20 points 30 times this season.  Anfernee Simons received four stitches on his cheek, head coach Terry Stotts said. Timberwolves: Wiggins eight assists were a season high.  Minnesota had nine players score at least eight points.  The Timberwolves are 196-3 when leading by 15 points entering the fourth quarter.","401161207"
"Adrian Wojnarowski breaks down the likelihood the Thunder will make moves involving Chris Paul and Steven Adams before the trade deadline. (1:04) OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder spoiled Russell Westbrook's return. Westbrook scored 34 points, but the Thunder beat the Houston Rockets 113-92 on Thursday night. Westbrook was a league MVP and two-time scoring champ for the Thunder before being traded to the Rockets last summer for Chris Paul and draft picks. The fans remember him as the star who stayed after Kevin Durant left for then-rival Golden State in 2016, and they showered him with appreciation before the game. There was a tribute video, then loud cheers as he was introduced with enthusiasm, in the same manner as a home Thunder player. The crowd stood, cheered loudly and even chanted M-V-P as the announcer moved on to other players. Westbrook even ran over to a corner of the court and exhorted the crowd before the tip, just like he did when he played for the Thunder. ""Some things you can't put into words,"" Westbrook said. ""I've been here for so long and so many great memories, great people. The absolute best fans in the world because they come with it, and tonight they came with it."" The atmosphere also lifted the Thunder. ""The energy was amazing,"" Paul said. ""Our first nationally televised game and Russ being back so we knew that the crowd -- I mean the crowd is always great, but we knew it was going to be a different energy tonight with Russ' first game back here and I mean, you've got to get excited during the player intros. Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) and I were just sitting over there talking about, you know, 'All right, let's get to it."" It was a strange day for Westbrook. He said he had never even seen the visiting locker room during his 11-year run in Oklahoma City. It was a bit odd for him early in the game when the crowd that he so often riled to a fever pitch was cheering for the other team during a run that put the Rockets on their heels. ""Definitely different, but once you start hooping and competing, you kind of zone it out a little bit,"" he said. Westbrook scored 18 points in the first half, but the Thunder led 60-48 at the break after shooting 53.8% from the field. The Thunder extended their lead throughout the second half. Westbrook was subbed out with 7:18 remaining. Danilo Gallinari led the Thunder with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Gilgeous-Alexander added 20 points. Houston's James Harden, who entered the night averaging a league-best 38.5 points, was held to 17 on 5-for-17 shooting. After the game, Westbrook embraced several Thunder players, then went over and hugged Thunder owner Clay Bennett. He acknowledged the crowd one last time before he exiting on the opposite end of the floor from his days as a Thunder player. Westbrook was the last remaining player from the team that began playing in Oklahoma City in 2008 after the franchise left Seattle. ""I don't regret one thing being here in Oklahoma City,"" he said. ""I don't regret signing back, I don't regret staying here. I don't regret anything that I did here. I feel like I left everything out on the floor every single night and did what I could for the city."" --- TIP-INS Rockets: Harden wore shoes with Thunder colors as part of an Adidas campaign. ... The Rockets made just 11 of 40 3-pointers. ... Another former Thunder player, Thabo Sefolosha, entered the game in the fourth quarter. ... Houston's point total was a season low. Thunder: Oklahoma City shot 53.8% in the first quarter to take a 37-21 lead. It was the Thunder's highest-scoring opening quarter of the season. ... Paul scored 18 points and Dennis Schroder added 16. ... Thunder G Hamidou Diallo was issued a technical foul in the fourth quarter. OKC's SPECIAL UNIFORMS The Thunder wore special gray and gold City Edition uniforms. They were designed in partnership with the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum to commemorate the upcoming 25th anniversary of the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. QUOTABLE Westbrook: ""The fans here, the people, they never did me no wrong. I have nothing, no bad blood, nothing here in this city from no fans or nobody in this organization because they gave me all they have, and I gave them all I have.""

"WASHINGTON --  Trae Young entered Friday night's game against the Washington Wizards as the NBA's fourth leading scorer, averaging 29.2 points per game. In the Atlanta Hawks' last game, Young had a triple-double with 42 points in a loss to the Houston Rockets. The Wizards knew they had to contain Young, and they pulled it off, limiting him to 19 points. Young missed all seven of his 3-point attempts in Washington's 111-101 win over Atlanta. Gary Payton II drew the assignment to guard Young, and he watched plenty of tape of Young's terrific game Wednesday night. Payton signed with the injury-riddled Wizards on Dec. 23 and has started eight of his 10 games. Most of his shots come from 3s, Payton said. That's how he gets going. We just tried to limit his 3s and make him take deep 3s. That's what we did. Young has to carry much of the offensive burden for the Hawks (8-31), who have the worst record in the NBA, and lost for the 14th time in 16 games. Gary's a really good defender, Young said. He's obviously known for his defense. A lot of shots were self-inflicted. I couldn't knock down shots. There were some shots that I had, and I had wide open layups that I just didn't make. While Washington shot just 37.5%, they did some other things right. They grabbed 57 rebounds, including a season-high 19 offensive boards, and committed just nine turnovers, with only one in the final quarter. The Wizards trailed 93-90 midway in the fourth quarter and outscored the Hawks 21-8 to secure the win. Jordan McRae scored 29 points but shot just 10 for 26 and had a career-high eight rebounds and six assists. Troy Brown Jr. added 18 and 10 rebounds. Atlanta (8-31), which has the worst record in the NBA, lost for the 14th time in 16 games. Trae Young, who had 42 points in a defeat to Houston on Wednesday, led the Hawks with 19 points. John Collins had his second straight double-double with 15 points and 15 rebounds for Atlanta, and Alex Len had 10 points and 14 rebounds. TIP-INS Hawks: F/C Bruno Fernando missed his second straight game due to personal reasons. Coach Lloyd Pierce said there's no timetable for his return. ... F Jabari Parker was out for the fourth consecutive game with a right shoulder injury. Pierce said Parker began treatment on the shoulder Friday. He'll be evaluated, I think, in another 10-12 days as to where he is, and what we can do from there,"" Pierce said. Wizards: G Bradley Beal (right leg) was out for the seventh time in the last eight games. Getting better. I know I've been saying that for a while, coach Scott Brooks said. We're going to be very cautious. We're not going to put him out there until he's 100%. He's not ready yet."" ... F Davis Bertans returned after missing nine games with a right quad strain. Bertans played 21 minutes and scored 14 points. ... C Thomas Bryant, who hasn't played since Dec. 3 with a stress reaction in his right foot is nearing a return, Brooks said. ... G John Wall, who hasn't played this season in his rehab from Achilles tendon surgery, played 3-on-3 on Thursday. I thought he looked great, Brooks said. ROUGH GUARDS Isaiah Thomas is in a rough stretch for Washington. He shot just 2 for 16 and in his last two games is just 4 for 24. He's going to have to bounce back, Brooks said. We're going to need better scoring from Isaiah and Ish. Ish Smith, who had been on a tear, was only 4 for 15 from the field, and in his two last games, is 8 for 28. HAWKS DISAPPOINTED Pierce thought this was a game his team should have won. They shot 36%, he said. Those are the games you're supposed to win except for the effort department.","401161209"
"Jay Williams disagrees with Kendrick Perkins for trying to call out Kevin Durant on Twitter and says Durant should feel free to respond to whomever he wants. (1:57) NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie had the best passing night of his career, and Rodions Kurucs played his best game of the season for Brooklyn. Dinwiddie scored 26 points and had a career-high 14 assists, Kurucs scored a season-best 19 points and Taurean Prince added 17 as the Nets snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 117-113 win over the Miami Heat on Friday night. ""I hope that's the spark because the talent's there,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said regarding Kurucs' play. ""We saw last year. He decided to come out and defend tonight like he did last year. We gave him the assignment of Jimmy Butler. I think that excited him."" Kurucs admitted the game may be a ""turning point"" for his play going forward. Jarrett Allen finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds for his team-high 17th double-double of the season. Jimmy Butler scored 33 points and Bam Adebayo added 22 for the Heat. Miami's Duncan Robinson missed a 3-pointer from the corner with 5.7 seconds left that would've tied the game. ""The Brooklyn Nets deserved to win this game,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We got what we deserved. They came out and out-competed us. Even when we were ahead and when we were scoring the basketball, they were winning physicality battles, clearly rebounding, getting to loose balls, things of that nature. You just have to credit them. We are still searching for maturity on the road as a basketball team. We didn't take a step forward in that department tonight."" The loss dropped Miami to 10-10 on the road, which Butler blamed on the starters. ""If the starters don't set the tone and asked to do what they are supposed to, it will end like that a lot of times,"" Butler said. The Nets came up with several clutch plays down the stretch. Caris LeVert hit a step-back 3-pointer to give Brooklyn a 112-111 lead with 1:09 remaining and Prince hit a floater in the lane that extended the lead to 114-111 with 25.9 seconds left. Butler hit back-to-back jumpers and a layup to give Miami a 109-100 lead with 5:09 remaining, but Brooklyn responded with a pair of 3s by Dinwiddie and LeVert to cut the deficit to three with 3:37 left. The Nets turned up the defensive intensity in the third quarter and held Miami to 20 points in the period, which ended in an 89-all tie. Miami led 69-57 at the half. Butler led all scorers with 19 points. Brooklyn attempted three free throws in the first half and relied on perimeter jumpers. Miami shot a blistering 65% from the field in the first quarter and Butler scored 13 points as the Heat took a 42-32 lead.

Lonzo Ball had 15 points and 11 assists, and Josh Hart finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds. ""It was a good team win,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We had guys come in and contribute, and when we needed to close the game I though Brandon did a great job."" The Pelicans have won seven of their last nine games, and the NBA's top draft pick, Zion Williamson, may soon join the cast. He has yet to make his NBA debut due to a knee injury. ""We are getting excited, and it's going to be really, really good for him to come into something that is really good for us right now,"" Ingram said. Taj Gibson led the Knicks with a season-high 19 points, shooting 8 for 8 from the field. RJ Barrett scored 16 points, and Reggie Bullock and Elfrid Payton finished with 15. The Knicks lost their fifth straight following a season-best three-game winning streak. Ingram had 10 points in the first quarter and Gibson scored 10 of the Knicks' first 23 points. New York had several three-point leads and the Pelicans were never ahead by more than five before settling for a 33-31 lead after the first quarter. Things opened up a bit in the second quarter. The Pelicans went on a 15-3 run to take their largest advantage of the half, 53-42, and led the rest of the way. New York scored the next seven points and pulled to 56-53, but Ingram scored seven of his 17 first-half points in the final minute to give the Pelicans a 67-61 halftime lead.

Turner set season highs with 27 points and 14 rebounds, and Indiana withstood a huge effort by Zach LaVine to beat the Chicago Bulls 116-105 on Friday night. The Pacers overcame 43 points by LaVine and escaped with the victory after Chicago rallied from 16 down to cut the deficit to four in the closing minutes. Aaron Holiday led a strong effort by the reserves with 19 points. T.J. Warren scored 17 after being fined $25,000 by the NBA for an altercation with Miami's Jimmy Butler on Wednesday night. Former Bulls player Doug McDermott finished with 16 points, and the Pacers won for the second time in three games even though Malcolm Brogdon (strep throat) and Domantas Sabonis (sore left knee) did not play. ""I thought we did a good job of `next man up' with Domas not playing tonight,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""Myles was involved a lot more because of the absence of Domas. He was at the 5 position and he did a good job making plays. He took the shot when it was there. Really got us off to a good start and had an impact on this game at both ends of the floor."" LaVine finished six points shy of his career high established at Charlotte in November. He scored 20 in a row for Chicago at one point. Coby White finished with 23 points, but the Bulls lost their sixth straight -- their worst skid since a 10-game slide in December and January last season. ""We've gotta find a way to dig one out,"" LaVine said. ""Obviously, it's frustrating. We've just got to find out how to scratch that win out.""

Justin Holiday wrapped two 3-pointers around a basket by Aaron to make it 94-79 with 7:29 left. It was 99-83 midway through the fourth before Chicago came storming back, cutting it to 103-99 on a 3 by Lauri Markkanen with just over three minutes remaining.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies are on their longest winning streak of the season, defeating teams above them in the standings and relying on youthful excitement in their drive for a spot in the postseason. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 24 points, Ja Morant added 22 points and a season-high 14 assists and the Grizzlies won their fourth-straight game, beating the San Antonio Spurs 134-121 on Friday night. Dillon Brooks also scored 22 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 21 as six Memphis players scored in double figures. The victory put the Grizzlies percentage points ahead of the Spurs for eighth place in the Western Conference. And, while there still is more than half the season left, Memphis players were aware of the victory's meaning in the standings. ""Playoffs is a goal,"" Valanciunas said. ""We're playing better and better every day, so it's fair to dream about playoffs, right?"" The Spurs' play Friday night was not indicative of their recent performances in which they recorded double-digit wins over Eastern Conference leaders Milwaukee and Boston earlier in the week. ""If you don't bring it in the NBA, you don't win,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I think we had three or four guys who were no-shows, and that didn't help."" DeMar DeRozan held up his end, matching his season-high with 36 points, and adding nine assists and nine rebounds for the Spurs. LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes each scored 21 points, combining to go 9 of 17 from 3-point range. ""Lately, I think we've been playing better than we've played all season,"" Forbes said, adding ""(Friday), it was the small things."" Unlike when the Spurs defeated the Grizzlies 145-115 on Dec. 23, Memphis charged to a double-digit lead in the first half, with the margin reaching 15 points. But the Grizzlies squandered much of the advantage in the closing minutes of the first half, clinging to a 63-57 lead at halftime. DeRozan helped keep the Spurs close in the third quarter, scoring 18 in the frame as Memphis held a scant 100-98 lead heading into the fourth. ""If he didn't do what he did, we would've gotten beat to death,"" Popovich said of DeRozan. "" . Too many guys were basically deferring to the basketball gods."" But the Spurs were still close midway through the fourth. One of Aldridge's 3-pointers pulled San Antonio within 116-113 with 6:28 remaining. But the Grizzlies converted a trio of 3-pointers, two from Brooks, and built their lead to 125-113. Meanwhile, Morant was going 6 of 8 from the field for 12 points in the closing frame, the ninth time the rookie and second overall pick in last summer's draft has recorded double-digit scoring in the fourth. ""That was some high-level basketball from two good teams,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. TIP-INS Spurs: DeRozan has led the Spurs in scoring the last eight games. . DeRozan has 10 straight games with at least 20 points. . Aldridge connected on his third 3-pointer of the game in the second quarter, his 38th of the season, a career-best. His previous was 37 3-pointers during the 2014-15 season. . Aldridge has made a 3-pointer in nine straight games. Grizzlies: Played the second game of a six-game homestand, their longest of the season. . Jackson has a 3-pointer in 27 straight games, matching the same string as Mike Milller for second-place in franchise history. Tyreke Evans holds the record of 31 straight. . Morant recorded his fifth double-double of the season. HELPING HAND The Grizzlies recorded 39 assists in the game, one off the franchise mark of 40 in 1997, back in the Vancouver days. ""I feel like we are playing unselfish right now,"" Morant said. ""Coach keeps preaching that we've got like 30-plus assists in multiple games. . He's always preaching just go out and compete, play unselfish, play together. I feel like that's what we're doing now, and it's showing."" NOSE FOR THE BALL At one point in the game, Morant was out of control and -- in desperation -- fired a pass that was only a short distance from Valanciunas. It was too close for the 6-foot-11 center to react before it hit him in the face. ""Ja, you owe me a nose,"" Valanciunas shouted across the Memphis locker room. ""Sorry, big fella,"" Morant responded with a laugh.","401161213"

The four-time MVP scored or assisted on seven of the first nine LA baskets to help build a 22-point lead in the first half, while Doncic missed five free throws while ending up a team-worst minus-24 in scoring margin before halftime. Hence, the torn jersey. ""I played really bad,"" said Doncic, the 2019 Rookie of the Year. ""I felt like I don't know how to play basketball. It wasn't me. I gotta get better. A lot."" James was 14 of 25 from the field to help the Lakers shoot 53%, and his 16 rebounds were a season high in LA's seventh consecutive win. ""It's not about how many you can win in a row,"" James said. ""It's just how you continue to get better every individual game and I thought we did that here."" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was as flummoxed as his young star, getting ejected after his second technical early in the fourth quarter when he exploded over the Lakers getting to challenge an out-of-bounds call after he thought the Mavericks had thrown the ball in. Doncic, who had played James just about even while the Lakers took two of first three in the season series, had 25 points and 10 rebounds. But Dallas trailed by double digits for all but the first five-plus minutes. ""Those are emotions and feelings that are about winning and losing,"" Carlisle said. ""I get it. He's going through a lot this year. He's going through a lot of different situations."" Davis missed the first game of a road back-to-back after taking a nasty fall in a 117-87 win over the Knicks in Los Angeles on Tuesday night. An MRI exam showed no major concerns, although Davis was extremely sore. Kuzma filled in just fine in his second start, scoring 11 points in the first quarter after totaling just 13 in the first three meetings with Dallas. He ended up 9 of 22 from the field, 2 of 8 from long range. ""It's not any extra motivation,"" said Kuzma, whose previous season high was 25. ""I'm just confident, especially when I know, being I'm a rhythm player, when my minutes are high, just trying to be myself."" Both leading men -- James and Doncic -- were without their star sidekicks for the final regular-season meeting as both fell short of a triple-double after both had one in the previous meeting in Dallas. They had seven assists apiece. Mavericks forward Kristaps Porzingis has already been ruled out for the final two games of a six-game homestand because of a sore right knee. It's not the knee the 7-foot-3 Latvian injured in his final game for the Knicks almost two years ago. The Mavericks got within 91-81 late in the third quarter when Doncic found Tim Hardaway, who scored 22 points, for a 3-pointer. It was the closest Dallas had been since 19-9 midway through the first. Dallas never did get the deficit back to single digits, and James hit a 3 to open the fourth quarter to push the lead back to 16. TIP-INS Lakers: LA led 45-27 after the first quarter, topping the previous season high for any quarter of 43 in the first quarter of a 117-017 win over Phoenix on New Year's Day. With a halftime lead of 79-58, the Lakers topped their previous best of 77 in the first half of a 136-113 win over Portland on Dec. 6. ... Rajon Rondo scored 10 points Mavericks: Dropped to 2/3 on a season-long six-game homestand, putting them at 11-10 at home compared to 12-5 on the road. ... Assistant coach Stephen Silas filled in for Carlisle after the ejection. ... Boban Marjanovic had 14 points and 10 rebounds. FLAGRANT AND TECHS Dwight Howard was called for a flagrant foul for shoving Maxi Kleber 33 seconds after entering the game in the first quarter, prompting a five-point possession for Dallas that ended with a goal-tending call against Howard. The foul was called as Hardaway hit a jumper. Hardaway missed one of the two free throws awarded for the foul, then Howard grabbed Seth Curry's runner on its way down. Howard got his fifth foul midway through the third quarter, but had already scored all 10 of his points by then. Lakers coach Frank Vogel matched Carlisle in the first half with a technical foul. Kuzma was called for one in the third quarter.","401161214"
"PHOENIX --  Two deflating losses in their previous two home games had the Phoenix Suns doing some soul-searching going into Friday night. Then, defense and clutch shooting in the final minute got them a much-needed win. Devin Booker scored 24 points, including late back-to-back 3-pointers, and Ricky Rubio came up with a steal and a free throw to help the Suns rally past the Orlando Magic 98-94. Booker had scored only two points in the second half before hitting a 3-pointer with 52.9 seconds left that cut Orlando's lead to 94-93. He then hit a another 3-pointer with 36 seconds left. On defense, Rubio stole the ball from Nikola Vucevic with 16.7 seconds remaining. Determination, desperation, obviously we've been needing one, Booker said. He'd gotten an important steal of his own after his first 3 of the final minute. I was just in the moment. I got a steal, felt the open shot for the two-for-one so I took it and it went in, Booker said. The Suns scored the final eight points of the game after Vucevic knocked down a 3 from the top of the arc with 59.4 seconds left, giving the Magic a 94-90 lead, Orlando's largest of the game. Magic coach Steve Clifford wanted a foul when Vucevic backed down Booker in the paint before Rubio's steal. Not even close, Clifford said. He (Booker) fouled him twice, the second one was a slap and that's got to be called. ""We played hard enough, we did some good things, that's got to be called. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 22 points and Rubio added 11 points, 10 assists and three steals, giving him 1,001 for his career. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 28 points, 16 in the second half. Vucevic added 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Terrence Ross scored 18 off the bench. It's unfortunate that we had the lead with 58 seconds left and we couldn't hold on to it, Vucevic said. Phoenix led by as many as 11 points in the third quarter, but the Magic roared back, taking their first lead of the game at 69-68 on a 3-pointer and two free throws by Fournier. The Suns took a 77-75 lead when Deandre Ayton hit a short hook shot just before the buzzer at the end of the third. But Orlando scored the first six points of the fourth on 3s by Fournier and Josh Magette, It was Magettes only basket of the game. The game was mostly back-and-forth, with the exception of a few double-digit leads for the Suns. Off a blocked shot from Cam Johnson at the defensive end, Mikal Bridges took the ball coast to coast for a layup and a 27-25 lead the Suns carried into the second quarter. Ross bowled over Aron Baynes and put in a wild shot off the glass to cut the Suns lead to 40-38 at the 5:46 mark of the second. Markelle Fultz had 13 points and Ross 12 in the first half. Booker forced Fournier to lose his balance on defense, then swished a step-back 3 that gave Phoenix its largest lead of the first half, 10 points at 58-48, with 33 seconds to go. The Suns took that lead into halftime. Booker scored 16 first-half points and Oubre 13. We are not going through a good stretch and results shouldn't help that way, but it does,"" Rubio said. It means we did the right thing. I'm happy how it happened, too, because it came down the stretch and we were locked in. The 94 points allowed and 37.1 field goal percentage were season lows for the Suns' defense. Booker led the Suns in scoring for the sixth straight game. TIP-INS Magic: F Aaron Gordon sat out with a right calf injury he sustained against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.  G D.J. Augustin also missed the game with a left knee injury.  Wes Iwundu and Khem Birch started at the two forward spots for Orlando, with Jonathan Isaac and Gordon out due to injuries. Suns: Coach Monty Wiliams, in discussing the development of young centers during pregame comments: I wish everyone could be Shaq. Everybody is not 7-1, 335 and can dance.  F Frank Kaminsky III missed his sixth straight game with a stress fracture in his right knee.  Baynes got the start at center over former No. 1 overall pick Ayton, whod started the previous three games. Ayton finished with 13 points and 9 rebounds. SWAT INTO THE SEATS Oubre sent a Ross 3-point try into the seats behind the Suns bench with an emphatic block. The sound of hand hitting ball brought players and fans out of their seats with 6:53 left in the third quarter.","401161215"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Opponents are starting to find out just how tough the Utah Jazz can be on defense over 48 minutes. The Jazz clamped down on the Charlotte Hornets from start to finish in a 109-92 victory on Friday night. Utah contested shots, forced a flurry of early turnovers, and won a second straight home game by double-digits. Utah has won eight straight games and 13 of 14. Charlotte struggled under intense defensive pressure from the Jazz from the opening tip. Utah forced seven turnovers in the first quarter alone. The Jazz racked up 14 of their first 19 points off those miscues. ""We didn't want to let them get confidence early,"" center Rudy Gobert said. ""We didn't want to do that the whole game, so we stayed consistent through the whole game. That's why we were able to create that much of a gap."" Gobert put his stamp on the game early and finished with 15 points, 13 rebounds, and six blocked shots while playing only three quarters. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was a force at both ends of the court in the first half. He blocked four shots, matching his total blocks over the previous four games. Gobert intimidated the Hornets from doing much on offense. ""I don't care how big he is, we still gotta be physical,"" guard Terry Rozier said. ""We still gotta make him feel us, because he's making us feel them. You gotta get your mind ready going into the game."" Jordan Clarkson led the Jazz with 20 points off the bench. Bojan Bogdanovic added 16 points and Georges Niang chipped in 15 while matching his career high with five 3-pointers. Rozier scored 23 points to lead the Hornets. Miles Bridges added 11. Charlotte finished with 21 turnovers, leading to 24 points for the Jazz. The Hornets have lost three straight. The Jazz swept the regular-season series with the Hornets for the second straight season. ""We just kind of made it tough on them from the start,"" forward Joe Ingles said. ""The flip side of that when you're able to score on the other side of getting stops, the game is a bit easier."" Utah raced to a huge lead. The Jazz outscored the Hornets 19-2 over a five-minute stretch for a 29-11 advantage late in the first quarter. Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale and Niang combined for four 3-pointers to fuel the run. Gobert bookended the outburst with a pair of dunks. Charlotte's seven first-quarter turnovers played a critical role in the run. ""They're a fantastic defense, but they're not known for turning teams over,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""But we shot ourselves in the foot tonight, especially on that end in the first quarter."" Utah kept the pressure on in the second quarter. The Jazz extended their lead to 25 points lead three times in the two minutes before halftime, and led 61-36 on a dunk by Gobert. BENCH BREAKOUT Utah's second unit has quietly turned into a strength as the calendar has flipped to a new year. The Jazz scored at least 40 bench points for the fourth straight game after outscoring the Hornets 56-39 in bench points. They totaled 57 bench points against the Knicks on Wednesday night and are playing with a fresh energy since acquiring Jordan Clarkson in December. In both victories, no Jazz starter played 30 or more minutes. ""Obviously, the guys who are on the bench unit throughout the whole year -- we take pride in minutes and things like that,"" Niang said. ""Getting out there and trying to make an impact for our starters is something big to us."" DEFENSE FIRST Donovan Mitchell scored just four points on 2-of-9 shooting in 22 minutes. Mitchell battled illness en route to not scoring in double figures for the first time this season. He focused his energies on making an impact on the defensive end and succeeded in that effort. ""He still defended,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Other guys had an opportunity to score, but he didn't let his teammates down on the defensive end."" TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte's only lead of the game came at the 8:25 mark in the first quarter when Bridges knocked down a 3-pointer to put the Hornets up 7-5. . Willy Hernangomez scored a season-high 15 points to lead the Hornets' second unit. Jazz: Niang went 8 of 12 from 3-point range over two games against Charlotte this season. . Utah totaled nine assists on 11 first-quarter baskets. . The Jazz scored at least 40 bench points for the fourth straight game. Utah outscored the Hornets 56-39 in bench points.","401161216"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  With Giannis Antetokounmpos sore back acting up again, the Milwaukee Bucks got plenty of help picking up the scoring slack. Thats nothing new. The NBAs best team is 9-2 when someone other than Antetokounmpo leads them in scoring, and the Bucks did it again to keep rolling on the road. Khris Middleton had 27 points and 11 rebounds, Eric Bledsoe scored 24 and Milwaukee beat the Sacramento Kings 127-106 on Friday despite an off night for Antetokounmpo. ""To have his back when hes not playing well -- he has our back all the time,"" Bledsoe said. ""Damn near all 30-something games. Just to have his back this one time says a lot about this team."" Milwaukee improved to an NBA-best 34-6 and extended the best start in franchise history. Antetokounmpo, who has been dealing with a cranky back for several weeks, was held to a season-low 13 points and 10 rebounds. The reigning MVP took only nine shots and picked up three of his four fouls in the first half. It was the 11th time this season  and seventh in the past 11 games  that Antetokounmpo did not lead the Bucks in scoring. Donte DiVincenzo had a season-high 18 points and Sterling Brown added 11 points and 12 rebounds for Milwaukee, which is 16-4 on the road. Those two guys (Bledsoe and Middleton) were phenomenal, and then some of the bench, Donte and some of those guys, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. I think Giannis has a ton of faith, a ton of confidence in his teammates, but its good for those guys to come through on a night like tonight. DeAaron Fox had 19 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds for Sacramento. Harrison Barnes scored 19 before limping off the court and into the locker room late in the fourth quarter. I was proud of the guys fighting and taking the lead in the third quarter, but we are not going to beat a team that good when they shoot 30 free throws to our 10, we turn the ball over 16 times, and we go 10 for 35 from the 3, Kings coach Luke Walton said. To beat a team like the Bucks we have to be hot and disciplined for longer stretches. Milwaukee trailed midway through the third, then took control with a 20-3 run over 3:32 while Antetokounmpo rested on the bench. Middleton had seven points and Brown and DiVincenzo both hit 3-pointers to help the Bucks go up 80-66. Milwaukee led by 18 early despite a slow start by Antetokounmpo. He took just four shots in the first half and was called for his third foul with 19 seconds remaining before halftime. Antetokounmpo also found himself in the middle of the lane when Sacramentos Trevor Ariza sprinted in for a two-handed dunk that cut the Bucks' lead to 49-43. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpos double-double was his 33rd of the season. ... Bledsoe made his first six shots.  Milwaukee has won seven straight against Sacramento. Kings: Marvin Bagley III (left foot soreness) is on track to play Monday against Orlando. Bagley has missed eight games since getting hurt Dec. 26 against Minnesota. Richaun Holmes (right shoulder) and Bogdan Bogdanovic (ankle) also sat out.  Fox was whistled for a technical foul in the second quarter after being called for a charge. Fox protested and angrily bounced the ball on the court before being hit with the technical. BLEDSOES START Bledsoe scored 11 points in the first quarter but probably wouldnt have had that many had Budenholzer pulled him out as he intended. We actually had a sub for him at the table for two or three of those minutes and he just kept getting to the basket, getting steals, making things happen, the coach said. When youre on the road you want to establish something early and he was great.","401161217"
"Max Kelleman argues that Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the world and that the Lakers should be concerned about facing him in the playoffs. (1:39) LOS ANGELES --  After having four days off, the Los Angeles Clippers looked more rusty than rested during the first three quarters of their game Friday night against the Golden State Warriors. Then, they were able to get things in gear just in time. Kawhi Leonard scored 10 of his 36 points over the final 12 minutes as the Clippers rallied from a 10-point deficit at the start of the fourth quarter for a 109-100 victory. We put so much energy and stuff in the past two days that I felt we were trying to do the right thing instead of just playing,"" said Lou Williams, who added 21 points. We started playing more free and open in the fourth. Our energy picked up, we got some stops and the pace picked up."" The Warriors had a 83-73 lead going into the final 12 minutes before Los Angeles went on a 14-2 run over the first three-plus minutes to take a 87-85 lead. Montrezl Harrell keyed the rally with seven of his 11 points. Eric Paschall's jumper tied it at 87 before Williams hit a fadeway 3-pointer with 6:56 remaining to give the Clippers the lead for good. Leonard put an exclamation point on the win with a driving dunk with 1:16 remaining to put LA up by six and give it two straight wins over Golden State for the first time since 2011. Leonard also had nine rebounds, five assists and three steals. He is the first Clippers player to have at least 36 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three steals in a game since Ron Harper in 1994. In the fourth quarter, we took care of the ball,"" Leonard said. I feel like they were making shots early and doing a good job running their offense. In the fourth, we were able to contest shots."" The Clippers shot only 25% from beyond the arc (8 of 32) and committed 17 turnovers in the first three quarters, but were 3 of 7 on 3-pointers and committed only two turnovers in the fourth. They just overwhelmed us,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. Kawhi and Lou Williams both got going, Harrell got going, and we just couldnt put the ball in the basket. We just couldnt quite keep up with them in the fourth. Rivers isn't panicking over the Clippers slow starts, but he does realize it could become a problem over the long run. There's not a lot we can do about it today. If we play like that in April or May, that will hurt us,"" he said. Glenn Robinson III and Omari Spellman scored 17 apiece for Golden State, which has lost its last seven, and Alec Burks added 16. The Warriors had a 53-48 lead at halftime. It was tied at 37 when Spellman sank a pair of 3-pointers during a 9-2 Golden State run. It was tied at 58 early in the third quarter when the Warriors retook control with a 12-4 run that included six points from Burks. They would extend their lead to 10 at the end of the third, STRONG START Spellman made his first start as a member of the Warriors and made half of their 3-pointers, going 4 of 8. He started 11 games as a rookie last season with Atlanta, but was excited about the opportunity on Friday night. This is the opportunity Ive been waiting for. My confidence has been coming back, so just wanted to hoop, he said. Spellman is averaging 7.7 points this season, but this was his fifth straight game in double figures. BENCH DUO Williams had eight assists. This is his fourth straight game with at least 20 points and five assists off the bench, which is the third longest such streak in NBA history. Harrells 11 points and 10 rebounds give him sixth double-doubles off the bench this season, which is tied for first in the league. TIP INS Warriors: Golden State was 8 of 39 on 3-pointers, which is the sixth time this season it has shot under 21% from beyond the arc. That already is the most games in Kerr's six seasons as coach. ... Paschall had 12 points and Damion Lee added 10. ... Burks was 9 of 9 from the line and extended his free throw streak to 35, which is a career high. His previous high was 23 in 2017.

"HOUSTON --  James Harden didn't have much to say after he surpassed 20,000 points on Saturday in Houston's blowout win over Minnesota. It's a great accomplishment obviously,"" he said. I have a bigger picture and bigger goals but it's pretty cool."" Teammate and longtime friend Russell Westbrook, who also played in the game when Harden got the first points of his NBA career, was much more effusive in his comments about the milestone. To be able to do that on a very, very high level is something we don't take for granted,"" Westbrook said. Growing up in L.A. and being able to see him progress over the years to me is just a blessing to see as his friend and I'm truly happy for him. Harden scored 32 points in three quarters to help the Rockets roll to the 139-109 victory. Houston led by double figures for most of the game and used a huge run in the third quarter to put the game out of reach and bounce back after a lopsided loss to Oklahoma City on Thursday night. The 30-year-old Harden, who had 12 rebounds and eight assists, is the 45th player in NBA history to reach 20,000 points and the seventh-youngest. He entered the game 10 points away and reached the milestone in fitting fashion, on a step-back 3-pointer midway through the second quarter. The public address announcer simply said 20,000 after Harden hit the shot, before a video was played during the next timeout to mark the occasion. The video showed him making his first points in the NBA while with the Thunder, then making a free throw that gave him 10,000 points and a replay of the 3 that got him to 20,000. He got the game ball on Saturday and presented it to his mother. 'She has everything, Harden said. Every goal and achievement that I have, she has it. I gave it to her and she'll put it in a safe place. Already without Clint Capela because of a bruised heel, the Rockets lost fellow starter P.J. Tucker early in the first quarter when he fell hard on his right shoulder. But Houston was just fine without them thanks to another big game from Harden and a 30-point performance by Westbrook. Josh Okogie had 16 points off the bench for the Timberwolves. Karl-Anthony Towns remained out with a left knee sprain that has had him sidelined since mid-December. The 30-point defeat was their largest loss of the season. We need to be better in terms of withstanding runs, especially against a good team,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. You give them credit. They got us tonight."" The Rockets were up by 16 at halftime and 17 in the third quarter before scoring the next 16 points to push the lead to 89-56 with about 5 minutes left in the quarter. Harden made two 3-pointers in that span and added another three points when he was fouled on a 3 and made all the free throws. The Timberwolves had three turnovers, including two from Andrew Wiggins, to help Houston pad the lead. Minnesota cut the lead to 26 entering the fourth quarter, but the Rockets extended it to 115-82 with about 9 minutes left by opening the quarter with a 13-6 run. Westbrook made a layup soon after that before stealing the ball on a bad pass by Jeff Teague and dishing it to Ben McLemore, who found Thabo Sefolosha for a 3 that made it 124-86. The Timberwolves called a timeout and all of Houston's starters except Isaiah Hartenstein went to the bench after that with about 8 minutes to go. Hartenstein started in place of Capela and had 17 points and 15 rebounds. Eric Gordon added 17 points and tied a season high with five 3-pointers. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns missed his 13th straight game with his injury. ... F Jake Layman sat out for the 24th game in a row with a sprained left toe. ... Assistant coach Pablo Prigioni was ejected as the team walked off the floor at halftime after apparently saying something to the officials.

Tucker went to the locker room immediately after he was injured and didn't return. A team official said he had a stinger and D'ntoni said after the game that he was OK and should return for the next game. ... Westbrook has scored 20 or more points in 14 straight games and he had 10 assists Saturday.

"BOSTON --  Celtics coach Brad Stevens said giving his team a day off following its worst losing streak of the season felt like the right thing to do. It certainly re-energized Jayson Tatum. The third-year forward made six 3-pointers and scored a career-high 41 points as Boston cruised past the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans, 140-105 on Saturday night. Tatum's first career 40-point performance helped the Celtics snap a season-high, three-game skid. Shots were going in. It felt good. I felt like we played with a purpose today on both ends, from the beginning of the game, Tatum said. I felt like we did our job. I know we haven't been playing well lately. It felt good to start the game off right. Enes Kanter added 22 points and 19 rebounds, marking season highs in both categories. Gordon Hayward had 19 points and Kemba Walker finished with 17 points and seven assists. Boston shot 14 of 29 from the 3-point line and tied a season high for points. Frank Jackson scored 22 points for the Pelicans. Jaxson Hayes added 20. We just never got any traction offensively or defensively, really,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. They took us out of just about everything we tried to do. New Orleans played without Derrick Favors because a right hamstring strain, Jrue Holiday sat his fourth straight game with a left elbow contusion, Kenrich Williams missed his third consecutive game with back soreness and J.J. Redick sat with a left hamstring strain. Hayes and E'Twaun Moore started in place of Williams and Favors. The Celtics exploited the absences early. Tatum was active from a variety of spots on the floor, connecting on eight of his first nine shots. He scored 22 points in the the first half to help the Celtics build as much as a 22-point lead. Tatum reached 37 points in the third quarter, but badly missed back-to-back 3-point attempts. During a break in the action, Stevens called him over to the bench for a quick conversation. Tatum said Stevens told him just to relax and that he'd get to 40. I think everybody could tell I wanted to get it, Tatum said. So just take a deep breath for a second and go back out there. A few trips and a pair of finger roll finishes at the rim put over the magic number. Tatum said he'll take his night in stride like he's tried to do each of the last three seasons. I never get too high or too low when I play well or if I don't,"" he said. ""For me, I feel like I got a long way to go. And the guys I look up to, they have nights like this more often than not. ... I'm just gonna try to do it more often, be consistent and continue to get better."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Were outscored 74-42 in the paint. ... Shot 35 percent (9 of 26) with five turnovers in the first quarter. Celtics: Tatum reached double figures for the 28th consecutive game, extending a career high. It was his fifth career game with at least 30 points. ... Set a new season high for points in a quarter with 41 in the first period. It surpassed the 39 points they scored in the first quarter of their Nov. 9 win over Spurs. The 72 first-half points tied a season high. MILESTONE WATCH Kanter becomes the first Celtics reserve to record 22 or more points and 19 or more rebounds in a single game since Larry Bird (March 16, 1982). MAKING PROGRESS Pelicans rookie forward Zion Williamson was again on the floor for some pregame work, this time participating in some light 3-on-3 with teammates. Gentry says the No. 1 overall pick continues to make progress. The problem weve had is that we havent had an opportunity to practice, Gentry said. He does some development workouts and things like that. ... There will come a time when we stick him out to play but we dont have an exact date.","401161220"
"DETROIT --  Luke Kornet helped the Chicago Bulls to the type of start coach Jim Boylen was looking for. Kornet scored 12 of his 15 points in the first quarter and the Bulls took a big early lead and then held off Detroit at the end, beating the Pistons 108-99 on Saturday night to snap their six-game losing streak. Zach LaVine scored 25 points for the Bulls, who shot 64% in the first quarter and led 35-20 after one. ""I thought our energy in the first quarter was maybe the difference in the game for us,"" said Boylen, whose team lost the previous night to Indiana. ""I was not happy with our start last night and our energy to start the game, so I like that. I liked the adjustment we made."" Already without injured Blake Griffin, the Pistons lost Andre Drummond when he was ejected early in the third quarter. Still, Detroit rallied from an 18-point second-quarter deficit and trailed by just two in the fourth. The Bulls, however, built the lead back up to double digits toward the end. Chicago completed a four-game regular-season sweep of Detroit. ""Lack of intensity, and I take responsibility on that,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We didn't get having guys ready to play and come out with the right intensity. I thought the second half we did."" Lauri Markkanen and Daniel Gafford added 14 points each for the Bulls. Kornet went 5 of 6 from the field in the first quarter. ""I just happened to get the ball in some good opportunities, and making the shots,"" Kornet said. ""I don't think it was really anything special."" Derrick Rose led the Pistons with 20 points. Drummond's ejection came after he threw the ball off the back of Gafford's head. The exchange also resulted in a technical foul on Gafford. Detroit whittled the lead to two later in the third quarter but trailed 81-71 after three. The Pistons fought back again and trailed 89-87 in the fourth. Then Detroit unsuccessfully challenged a foul on Thon Maker inside. Chicago's Thaddeus Young made two free throws to start an 11-3 run by the Bulls. ROOKIE STARTER Gafford made the first two starts of his career Friday and Saturday. The rookie from Arkansas scored only two points Friday, but he made a significant contribution to the win over the Pistons. ""I could have been better last night, throughout the whole game,"" Gafford said. ""So tonight I wanted to change that. I wanted to have a different look on it. This was my second start. I wanted to come out and be more efficient, be better on defense, and be way better on offense."" EARLY EXIT Drummond finished with nine points and four rebounds, his first game all season with fewer than nine rebounds. It was his fewest rebounds since he had three on Jan. 18, 2019, against Miami. He left that game because of an injury. TIP-INS Bulls: Wendell Carter Jr. (right ankle sprain) missed the game. ... The Bulls are 4-2 in the second half of back-to-backs this season but are just 1-5 in the first half. Pistons: Detroit was without Luke Kennard (bilateral knee tendinitis). ... Rose has scored at least 20 points in five straight games, his longest streak since a five-game run in January 2012. ... Drummond made a 3-pointer in the first quarter. He entered the game 0 for 19 from long distance this season. ... The Pistons turned the ball over 19 times.","401161221"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Los Angeles Lakers fully expected victory, even without LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Kyle Kuzma was among those who took advantage. He scored a season-high 36 points and the Lakers rolled past the Oklahoma City Thunder, 125-110 on Saturday night. Lakers coach Frank Vogel said James had a chest cold. James is averaging 25.4 points, a league-leading 10.7 assists and 8.7 rebounds and has helped the Lakers to the best record in the Western Conference. Davis, who leads the Lakers with 27.1 points per game, sat out for his second straight game with a gluteus maximus contusion. Still, the Lakers felt they had enough to win, even against a Thunder team that had won 11 of 13. ""That's why you have a great team,"" said Quinn Cook, who led the Lakers' reserves with 13 points. ""We want to have guys who contribute one through 15. That's the goal of anybody putting a team together. Obviously, this team is talented. Everybody is selfless and everybody is ready. We all put the work in."" Kuzma, in just his third start of the season, made 15 of 24 shots. ""I just got an opportunity to get scoring opportunities, having the ball in my hands,"" Kuzma said. Rajon Rondo added 21 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists for the Lakers. Los Angeles shot 51.5% to win its eighth in a row. ""Rondo set the tone for us,"" Kuzma said. ""Going right after CP (Chris Paul) right out of the gate, being aggressive with his scoring. A lot of times, everybody knows him as a pass-first guy. He came out today in attack mode."" James played on Friday night and had 35 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists in a win over the Dallas Mavericks. Without him, the Lakers raced to a 73-49 halftime lead over the Thunder behind 58% shooting. Kuzma scored 23 points before the break. It was Oklahoma City's largest halftime deficit of the season. The Lakers extended the lead to 32 in the third quarter before Oklahoma City rallied and trimmed its deficit to 102-82 at the end of the period. The Thunder got as close as 11 points with 2:37 to go before a short jumper and a 3-pointer by Kuzma ended the rally. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari each scored 24 points for Oklahoma City. The Thunder came out flat after an emotional win over the Houston Rockets in Russell Westbrook's return on Thursday. It was a tough lesson for the Thunder, who have been surprisingly good this season. ""I thought that they brought the energy and the intensity, and we didn't match it from the first minute,"" Gallinari said. TIP-INS Lakers: G Danny Green sat out with a sore right hip. ... C Dwight Howard was issued a technical in the fourth quarter. ... Howard had 14 rebounds. Thunder: Reserve center Nerlens Noel missed the game with sprained left ankle. ... Gallinari was issued a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing a call against him. ... Shot 52.4% in the second half and outscored the Lakers 61-52. STAT LINES The Lakers got 48 points from their bench, including 13 points from Cook, 12 from Dwight Howard and Troy Daniels, and 11 from Alex Caruso. QUOTABLE Vogel on how Kuzma will benefit from the game: ""I really think that's going to carry over to when those guys (James and Davis) come back, and we'll continue to see his minutes grow and grow throughout the season.""","401161222"
"Coach Brett Brown says he's still excited about coaching the 76ers despite not having Joel Embiid. (0:41) DALLAS --  Luka Doncic was out for an impressive Dallas win in Philadelphia and didn't have European sidekick Kristaps Porzingis for the rematch in Texas. Dwight Powell was the big man around the basket and left the 76ers feeling like they'd had enough of Texas for now in their second straight game without star center Joel Embiid. Doncic had 19 points and 12 assists, Powell scored 10 of his 19 points in a decisive third quarter and the Mavericks beat the 76ers 109-91 on Saturday night. Powell was 5 of 6 from the field and had four of his season-high 12 rebounds in the third quarter, when the Mavericks outscored the 76ers 32-16 to turn a nine-point deficit into a 73-66 lead that grew to a 21-point margin in the fourth. Dallas erased a 12-point deficit from late in the first half, bouncing back a night after getting manhandled by LeBron James and the Lakers, who were without Anthony Davis. Embiid is sidelined after surgery for a torn ligament in a finger on his left hand. ""We've had some tough losses,"" Doncic said. ""We had a nice win. We needed it."" The Mavericks swept the two-game season series with an Eastern Conference contender after winning by 19 in Philadelphia when Doncic was out with a sprained ankle last month. It was the second straight loss in Texas for the 76ers, who capped a season-worst four-game losing streak in Houston before winning their previous two games. Tobias Harris had 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Philadelphia shot 24% (5 of 21) in the third quarter. ""That was the change of the game, was the third quarter,"" Harris said. ""All throughout the game we had good looks. Third quarter, we missed a bunch in a row."" It was Dallas' seventh straight game, and possibly last, without Porzingis. The 7-foot-3 Latvian has been out with right knee soreness -- not the same knee he injured in his final game with the New York Knicks. Coach Rick Carlisle said he could play on the upcoming two-game trip to California. Tim Hardaway Jr. had 12 points and a season-high nine rebounds to help the Mavericks finish 3-3 on a six-game homestand, their longest of the season. ""It's a great way to end the homestand,"" Carlisle said. ""We would have loved to have won another game or two. But we are where we are."" Doncic had another rough shooting night after ripping his jersey in frustration against the Lakers, going 4 of 15 but hitting 10 of 12 free throws. The 2019 Rookie of the Year, this year's NBA leader with 11 triple-doubles, had eight rebounds. Ben Simmons had 11 points and 11 assists but was held scoreless in the second half. The 76ers hoisted 98 shots but finished at 38%. ""It was a tale of two halves for sure,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""To have 19 more shots than a team, you wouldn't think when you look back down and looked at the score that it was going to equal that margin of a loss."" TIP-INS 76ers: Josh Richardson had a four-point play in the second quarter, hitting a 3 as he was fouled by Seth Curry and making the free throw. Richardson and Al Horford scored 16 apiece. ... Coach Brett Brown got a technical foul in the second quarter for complaining that Doncic pushed off on a step-back 3 over Richardson, who also wanted the call. Mavericks: Crowd favorite Boban Marjanovic sent the fans who were left into a frenzy with a 3-pointer in the final seconds against his former team. The 7-foot-4 Serbian had 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting. The only miss was another 3 seconds before the one he made. It was the second 3 of the season for Marajnovic, who was with the 76ers the latter part of last season and the playoffs. ... Dorian Finney-Smith had 16 points on 7-of-10 shooting. AUSTRALIAN UNITY Mavericks guard Ryan Broekhoff addressed the crowd at center court before the game alongside Simmons and Philadelphia's Jonah Bolden to tell the crowd about raising awareness of money for those affected by wildfires in Australia. All three players are from Australia. Broekhoff was in street clothes because he's out with a fractured left fibula. REBOUNDING REVERSAL Dallas reversed a woeful start on the boards by outrebounding the 76ers 18-9 in the third. Philadelphia grabbed the first 10 offensive rebounds of the game, but Dallas had a 5-1 edge in the third, with 10 second-chance points to two for the Sixers. SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT CLOSE The 76ers held the Mavericks to a season low for a half while taking a 50-41 halftime lead. A lead fueled by seven steals, including one by Furkan Korkmaz for a reverse dunk on a breakaway, could have been bigger if not for 2-of-19 shooting on 3s in the first half.","401161223"
"DENVER --  Denver coach Michael Malone was worried his team would have another letdown against a losing team. His fears were justified. Kevin Love had 19 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 111-103 victory over the Nuggets on Saturday night. Collin Sexton finished with 25 points and Tristan Thompson had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland, which held off a furious Denver rally to win its second straight and just its second against a team with a winning record. ""They made their run, we were able to keep our composure, didn't panic,"" Love said. ""Guys made shots. Everybody gave us something down that the stretch that was able to give us the win."" Six of Denver's 12 losses have come against teams with 15 or fewer wins, with three of those coming at home. ""It seems like bad teams come in and play freely against us,"" Mason Plumlee said. ""We're expected to win. We need to play like it."" Malone hoped his team learned from a loss in Washington last week but an 8-for-39 night from 3-point range and sub-par defense cost the Nuggets against the Cavaliers. ""A lot of them were good shots, open shots. The shots were not going in,"" Malone said. ""You have to be able to rely on something, hang your hat on something, and that was our defense. Right now we can't hang our hat on really anything."" The Nuggets trailed by as many as 17 and were down 14 to start the fourth before outscoring the Cavaliers 25-10, led by Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic, before Cleveland recovered. Held in check for three quarters, Murray had 14 points in the period while Jokic scored 10 in the fourth and hit a 3-pointer that gave Denver its first lead of the game at 96-95. Cleveland didn't wilt, getting 3-pointers from Sexton and Cedi Osman and a floater by Darius Garland to give the Cavaliers a 103-98 led with 2:55 left. Murray finished with 24 points and Jokic had 19. ""We just missed shots,"" Murray said. ""That fourth quarter we took the lead but at that point they were in rhythm. If they're open and making shots they're confident."" Garland finished with 18 points and eight assists. ""We just had to finish it,"" Garland said. ""That's like a learning curve for us. We haven't finished games a lot but a good, winning team like that, they're always going to make a run."" The Nuggets had a chance to tie but Murray missed a 3-pointer. Will Barton, who had 18 points and nine rebounds, split a pair of free throws and Garland hit a 13-footer. Love made it 109-101 with a pair of free throws with 42 seconds left. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Osman finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds. ... G Dante Exum (flu) missed his third straight game but joined the team in Denver. ... Garland has scored in double figures in the last eight games. ... Thompson has a double-double in 19 games, which leads the team. Nuggets: F Paul Millsap (left knee contusion) sat out his second straight game. ... Barton returned to the lineup after missing one game to attend the funeral of his cousin, who was killed Dec. 26 in Baltimore. ... Monte Morris finished with 11 points off the bench. HONORING STERN The Nuggets held a moment of silence before the opening tip for former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who died on New Year's Day at age 77. They also played a video tribute to him during the first timeout of the game. This was Denver's first home game since Stern's passing.","401161224"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Milwaukee Bucks have bigger goals than a 70-win season, though their star player isnt taking their phenomenal start for granted. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 17 rebounds, Khris Middleton scored 30 points and the Bucks beat the Portland Trail Blazers 122-101 on Saturday night. Eric Bledsoe added 29 points for the Bucks, who made 14 3-pointers led by Middleton's 4-for-4 performance. Antetokounmpo was asked afterward if the Bucks have changed their mindset from the hunters to the hunted. We're still hunting, the reigning MVP said. Obviously teams are going to come and play hard against us. But at the end of the day we have to be the hunters. We have to have that mentality. Thats what weve been doing. Weve won 35 games and played 41. Thats crazy. But Middleton downplayed it. You cant win a championship in the regular season, Middleton said. Antetokounmpo had 13 points and seven rebounds in the first quarter alone and Milwaukee went on to its third straight win. That matched his entire point total from Friday nights win over Sacramento. Usually when Im not aggressive the previous game, I come out the next game more aggressive, Antetokounmpo said. I can remember since I started playing basketball and thats what we did tonight. Antetokounmpo also hit multiple 3-pointers for the 18th time this season, something he did only 13 times all of last season. Im comfortable, but I have to keep getting better, he said. The Bucks led 32-24 after the first quarter as Damian Lillard did his best to keep Portland within range, scoring 12 points in the first quarter. Lillard finished with 26 points while CJ McCollum scored 20 and Carmelo Anthony had 19 points and 11 rebounds, but Portland lost for the eighth time in 10 games. Yeah, it was a good effort but we dont show up to have a good effort, Lillard said. We show up to win. The Blazers shot just 10 for 36 from the 3-point line. The Bucks pushed their lead to as high as 17 multiple times in the third quarter and held a 97-80 lead after the period thanks to a tip-in by Pat Connaughton before the buzzer. A three-point play by Bledsoe pushed the Bucks lead to 116-94, their biggest of the game. A couple of possessions later, coach Terry Stotts removed the Blazers starters from the game. TIP-INS Bucks: Though Antetokounmpo is the biggest reason for the Bucks' NBA-best 35-6 record, the Bucks outscore their opponents by 8.3 points per 100 possessions when the MVP sits, according to NBA.com. I think (Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer) does a really good job of integrating all his players, Stotts said. They have interchangeable parts, they pass, they shoot, theyre unselfish, they have rim protection. Trail Blazers: The Blazers, who are dealing with a host of injuries, were forced to deal with illness on Saturday night. Starting center Hassan Whiteside missed the game after playing through an illness in Thursdays road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. McCollum missed a Jan. 5 game with an illness but according to Stotts, Whiteside was the only player still affected by the sickness that spread around the team over the past week. Anthony Tolliver started in Whitesides place, finishing with 11 rebounds and seven points in 28 minutes.","401161225"
"NEW YORK --  Julius Randle was not ready to play in a basketball game following the death of his grandmother earlier this week. He was feeling her presence on the Madison Square Garden floor on Sunday. Randle scored 11 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, RJ Barrett chipped in 23 and the New York Knicks rallied to beat the Miami Heat 124-121. ""My grandmother left an incredible legacy and mark on my life and my family, so it has been tough. It'll still be tough, but tonight was special and I really felt her out there the whole time,"" said Randle, who missed New York's previous two games. ""It's tough when somebody loses someone who is important to them. A couple of things have happened to us, and as a group. It affects everybody. You know, I cried when teammates lost their family members, it's tough and I feel the same compassion now, losing my grandmother."" Kevin Knox had 17 points off the bench and Reggie Bullock added 16 for the Knicks, who snapped a five-game losing streak. Jimmy Butler had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat, who blew a lead down the stretch for the second time during their weekend stay in New York. James Johnson scored 19 points for Miami, which has lost consecutive games for the first time this season. Randle had an impressive two-minute stretch late in the fourth quarter with eight points. He stole the ball from Johnson and made a 3-pointer to give New York a 116-114 lead with 2:16 to go. Randle later answered Johnson's 3 with a pair of free throws and then a layup to extend the lead to 122-119 with 34 seconds left. Interim coach Mike Miller credited the organization for giving Randle as much time as possible to be with his family. ""The biggest thing is the players know that as a group collectively we respect their privacy and the things they need to do individually to take care of their families,"" Miller said. ""I think organizationally everybody does a great job stepping up. We are here for you, and we will do anything they need."" The Heat led by 12 points at halftime of Friday night's game in Brooklyn before the slumping Nets beat them. ""This is not our first rodeo. We do not need to panic,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said. `We do not need to reinvent the wheel. We know how to do it. We've done it, and personnel has done it."" Miami went up by 14 on Derrick Jones Jr.'s 3-pointer with 3:33 left in the third quarter and appeared to be on its way to an easy win over a New York team whose last three losses were by a total of 66 points. The Knicks then scored 40 fourth-quarter points, though Butler had a chance to tie the game twice in regulation. Trailing by two points with 21 seconds second left, Butler was fouled by Bullock on a 3-point shot attempt but only made two of three free throws to cut the lead to 122-121. Barrett was then fouled and made one for a two-point lead. On the ensuing possession, Butler missed a layup but Miami was credited with the possession after the ball went out of bounds. Butler then turned the ball over on a bad pass intended for Bam Adebayo. Barrett was fouled again and made one to make it 124-121. Miami then gained possession after a replay review after the referees confirmed a loose ball following Barrett's missed free throw went out of bounds off a Knicks player. Miami called timeout and a desperation 3 by Adebayo was waved off because it came after the buzzer. Butler was 6 of 7 from the field and 5 of 6 from the free throw line to finish the first half with 17 points as Miami led 60-55. TIP-INS: Heat: Spoelstra said Justice Winslow went to see a back specialist. Winslow played last Wednesday at Indiana after missing 15 games due to a lower back bone bruise. Knicks: Backup point guard Frank Ntilikina did not play due to a groin injury. . Marcus Morris (sore neck) missed his fourth straight game. . New York's starting five finished in double figures. Taj Gibson had 14 points and Elfrid Payton finished with 10. Reserve Kadeem Allen chipped in 10. PROTECT THE PAINT The Knicks took advantage of Miami's lack of rim protection and scored 72 points in the paint. ""If somebody gets beat, it does happen because this is the best league in the world. You got to be there,"" Butler said. ""But a lot of the times you just got to man up and then you got to stand in front of the ball.""","401161226"
"WASHINGTON --  Even on their biggest roll in two years, the Utah Jazz believe they can get a lot better. Bojan Bogdonovic scored 31 points, Rudy Gobert added 21 points and 14 rebounds and the Jazz beat the Washington Wizards 127-116 on Sunday for their ninth straight victory. Utah overcame a 15-point deficit in the third quarter to win for the the 14th time in 15 games and climb up to second place in the Western Conference. ""It's pretty good, but we feel like we can be a lot better,"" Gobert said. ""The goal is not just to be second in the West, but be the best team in the West at the end of the playoffs."" Jordan Clarkson added 17 of his 23 points in the second half for the Jazz, one of six players in double figures as team scoring leader Donovan Mitchell sat out because of an illness. ""Obviously, Donovan is one of our key guys, so there's always going to be a lot of adjustment, a little different from any player,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I thought our guys did a really good job of absorbing that collectively."" Bradley Beal scored 25 points for Washington after missing five games with right leg soreness. Davis Bertans added 18 points and Jordan McRae had 16 . Washington lost at home for the first time in four games after letting the third-quarter lead evaporate. ""I think our aggression on both ends of the floor kind of slipped,"" Beal said. ""Turning the ball over, shot selection. Sometimes we had a lot of one-pass shots, no-pass shots. We were kind of slow pushing the pace."" Utah had a 21-3 run to take an 83-80 lead late in the third quarter. Clarkson gave Utah its first advantage since midway through the first quarter with a driving layup that made it 81-80, and followed that with a floater. The teams traded baskets for the remainder of the third, but Gobert's layup gave Utah the lead for good with 10 seconds left in the quarter. The Jazz opened the fourth on a 14-5 run to build their lead to 11. Washington would close it to within three once, but Gobert's three dunks inside the final four minutes helped seal the win. ""He does a good job of just being seven feet, and using his arms and his length to his advantage,"" Beal said. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell sat out two days after playing through illness Friday night. Emmanuel Mudiay started in Mitchell's place. ... Utah last won nine in a row from March 2-18, 2018. The Jazz also had an 11-game winning streak earlier that season. ... Gobert picked up his team-high fifth technical foul. Wizards: Prior to the game, waived guard C.J. Miles, who had been out since late November following wrist surgery, signed former two-way center Anzejs Pasecniks to a full-time contract, and signed forward Johnathan Williams to a two-way contract. ... Beal played 27 minutes after coach Scott Brooks said his time would be limited. His season low is 24. KEY INGREDIENT? Utah's nine-game streak lines up exactly with Clarkson's arrival in a trade from Cleveland the day before Christmas. His 23 points bested his previous high for Utah of 20 twice. ""He made some huge plays, through the whole game, but especially at the end,"" Gobert said. ""Getting to the rim, getting fouled, finding the open way, he did a tremendous job."" GETTING HEALTHY In addition to Beal, Bertans was in his second game back after missing nine with a quad injury. Center Thomas Bryant scored eight points in 15 minutes in his return after missing 20 games with a foot injury.","401161227"
"NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving hadn't played in two months and all he did in his return was make 10 of 11 shots in the best shooting night of his career. He knows it won't always be that easy. I mean, Im not going to shoot 10 for 11,"" he said with a laugh. I hope I can shoot 10 for 11 every night."" The Brooklyn Nets will take whatever they can get after seeing how much a healthy Irving means to them. The point guard scored 21 points in 20 minutes in his return from an injured right shoulder, leading the Nets to a 108-86 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday. Irving made a career-best 90.9% of his shots after missing 26 games with an impingement. The shoulder looked fine and his handle looked as good as ever while he dribbled his way around a hopeless Atlanta defense. Energized by his return that still seemed a ways away just a week ago, the Nets led by 39 points and won their second straight after dropping seven in a row. We had a certain confidence about us tonight that I think we were missing during that streak,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. So great, great timing having him back."" Cam Reddish scored 20 points for the Hawks, who played without star guard Trae Young because of a left hamstring injury and lost their fourth straight. The Nets made it such an easy night that their fans didn't need to worry about the scoreboard as they roared for Vince Carter's two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. The 42-year-old former Nets star finished with eight points in his final road appearance against the franchise. Obviously to come back here, and some of the other stops Ive played for, and just kind of to receive a standing O for one last time is just great, Carter said. Irving began feeling pain in his shoulder early in the season, and he took himself out of the lineup after a game in Denver on Nov. 14. The Nets held up well without him for a while thanks mostly to Spencer Dinwiddie's strong play, but had faltered recently, especially in crunch time. Irving got a cortisone shot on Dec. 24 and returned to full practice this week, just in time to return on his sister's birthday. Its not really a surprise for me,"" Irving said of his performance. I put in the work and when I do that I feel like the results will come."" He started alongside Dinwiddie to share the playmaking responsibilities and did most of his scoring near the basket, making the only 3-pointer he attempted. The Nets were already leading 70-46 at halftime before he went 5 for 5 for 10 points in a dazzling six-minute stretch of the third quarter. TIP-INS Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce said Young got treatment in Washington, where the Hawks practiced Saturday, and was still sore Sunday. Brandon Goodwin started in his place. Nets: Brooklyn has won the last eight meetings. That's only halfway to the longest winning streak in the series, as Atlanta won 16 straight from 1986-89. ... Brooklyn's previous biggest lead in a game this season was 26 points against Philadelphia on Dec. 15. CHEERING CARTER Carter got a nice ovation when he checked in and a loud one when he checked out for good. He spent 4 1/2 seasons with the franchise when it was in New Jersey and is third on the Nets' scoring list. His old team was a bit premature with its goodbye, playing a tribute video for Carter when the Hawks played here last year, though he had given no indication he planned to retire. He ended up coming back and became the first player to play 22 NBA seasons. Irving grew up in New Jersey as a fan of Carter and the Nets, and said he had Carter's jersey in his bag. That was a kids dream to go see Vince Carter and Jason Kidd play, but specifically Vince Carter. He used to do some amazing things,"" Irving said. It was incredible as a kid to watch. I dont want to take it for granted how much hes given up his life to sacrifice his time with his family and friends to be playing basketball for this long."" FAN FAVORITES Young and Irving are the leading vote-getters among Eastern Conference guards after the second returns of fan balloting for the NBA All-Star Game. Young had received 1,389,628 votes in totals announced Thursday, and Irving had 1,351,997. STATEMENT SHIRTS The Nets warmed up in shirts reading No Place for Hate."" The shirts were designed in collaboration with the Anti-Defamation League after a number of anti-Semitic attacks in Brooklyn over the past few months.","401161228"
"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan got another warm welcome in Toronto, and then helped San Antonio top the struggling Raptors. DeRozan scored 25 points, Rudy Gay had 15 and the Spurs rallied from an 18-point deficit to beat Toronto 105-104 on Sunday. ""Being down what we was down and still being able to fight back and pull it out was big, especially on the road,"" DeRozan said. San Antonio used a big fourth quarter to win for the third time in four games. Derrick White scored 13 points for the Spurs, and LaMarcus Aldridge had 11. DeRozan also collected eight rebounds and four assists while topping 20 points for the 11th straight game. ""He's been huge,"" White said of DeRozan. ""Creating for us, scoring, doing just about everything. He made big plays down the stretch."" San Antonio trailed 82-69 to begin the fourth and fell behind 87-73 on a 3 by Matt Thomas with 10:14 left. The Spurs responded with a 17-0 run, taking an 88-87 lead on Aldridge's layup with 6:34 to play, then capping their spurt with a pair of free throws from DeRozan. The Spurs led 100-91 with 2:37 left, but Kyle Lowry, Norman Powell and Serge Ibaka each made 3-pointers as Toronto tied it 100-100 on Ibaka's shot from distance with 1:17 left. Siakam broke the tie by making the second of two free throws with 41 seconds left, but Marco Belinelli replied with a 3 for the Spurs, making it 103-101 with 28 seconds remaining. After a Toronto timeout, Siakam missed a shot that would have tied the game. San Antonio's Lonnie Walker IV grabbed the rebound, Lowry fouled DeRozan, and the former Raptors star pushed the lead to four points by making a pair from the line. Lowry replied with a deep 3, cutting the deficit to one, and Aldridge missed a pair of free throws with four seconds left. But Siakam's long 3-pointer bounced off the backboard at the buzzer. DeRozan missed his first three free throws but made 11 straight the rest of the way. He didn't score until 1:25 remained in the first half and attempted just three shots in the first two quarters, but made six of nine attempts in the second half. Playing in Toronto as a visitor for only the second time, DeRozan received loud applause when he was introduced before the game. Fans rose for a standing ovation when DeRozan was honored with a tribute video during a first-quarter timeout, part of Toronto's ongoing 25th anniversary celebrations. ""It's amazing to be able to get that much recognition,"" DeRozan said. ""It never gets old."" When the Spurs visited Toronto last February, DeRozan turned the ball over in the final seconds, leading to a go-ahead dunk by Kawhi Leonard. This time, there were no miscues in the final moments. ""I'm pretty sure it means a lot to him to come back here and get a win,"" said Spurs center Jakob Poeltl, DeRozan's teammate in Toronto and San Antonio. ""Last year we were really close, we ended up losing a close game. This year it was a close game again and we ended up winning it."" Ibaka had 21 points and a season-high 15 rebounds for the Raptors, and Lowry finished with 16 points and a season-high 15 assists. Toronto is 4-6 since a five-game winning streak ended with a loss at Indiana on Dec. 23. The Raptors blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter against Portland last Tuesday, and needed overtime to win at Charlotte the following night. ""Normally our fourth-quarter defense is great, but it wasn't tonight,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. San Antonio's comeback spoiled the returns of Siakam and Powell, each of whom had missed 11 games since a Dec. 18 win at Detroit. Powell scored 20 points and Siakam had 15, including 12 in the first. ""Obviously happy to be back,"" Siakam said. ""Definitely a little tired but I'll take that after being out for a month."" FAMILY FIRST While battling San Antonio's Bryn Forbes for a loose ball in the third, Lowry landed heavily on Toronto's baseline, just in front of where his family was seated. Lowry got up and gave his son a kiss on the cheek, then returned to the court. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio is 6-12 on the road. . Poeltl had 10 rebounds. Raptors: Ibaka's double-double was his career-best eighth straight. . Toronto is still without C Marc Gasol, who has also been out since Dec. 18 because of a strained left hamstring, and G Fred VanVleet, who sat for the third straight because of a strained right hamstring.","401161229"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Memphis center Jonas Valanciunas likes to remind people that there's still room for the big man in today's NBA. But after one of his most productive games of the season, he emphasized the team philosophy. Valanciunas had 31 points and a season-high 19 rebounds and the Grizzlies dominated the second half, beating Golden State 122-102 on Sunday night to hand the Warriors their eighth straight loss. ""It wasn't just running the play for me or somebody else,"" Valanciunas said. ""You just share the ball, play together, find the open man. ... The ball was coming to my hands tonight."" Valanciunas was 13 of 17 from the field, including a 3-pointer to help the Grizzlies win their fifth straight. Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 21 points, while Ja Morant had 11 points and 10 assists. Tyus Jones and Grayson Allen also had 11 points each, Allen converting all three of his 3- pointers. D'Angelo Russell, who missed the previous six games with a right shoulder contusion, led the Warriors with 34 points. Alec Burks and Jordan Poole each had 13. ""It's the adversity that we have to keep chipping away at,"" Russell said about the losing streak. ""It's not easy to win in this league. Just have to look at film and see what we can do to get better."" The winning streak -- the longest of the season for the Grizzlies -- was built in the second half, Memphis outscoring the Warriors 62-43 after leading 60-59 at intermission. Valanciunas had 14 points and 11 rebounds at halftime, and continued his dominance in the third, crashing the boards and cashing in on second-chance points. Then a 3-pointer. By the time he headed to the bench for a break late in the third, the center had 15 points in the quarter, drawing a standing ovation from the Memphis faithful. That was part of Memphis outscoring Golden State 35-17 in the third for a 95-76 advantage after three. ""We're all playing, sharing the ball, trying to find the open man,"" Valanciunas said. ""That gives us the advantage over another team. It's fun to play that way. Just look for the open man and try to create a play for another guy."" TIP-INS Warriors: C Omari Spellman started his second game of the season. ""We're rewarding him for how well he's playing,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Spellman finished with 12 points. ... Have lost seven straight road games and 13 of last 14 on the road. ... Their last win this season was Dec. 27 against Phoenix 105-96. ...

Brandon Clarke matched his season high with 11 rebounds. HALFWAY HEADACHE The game was the Warriors' 41st of the season and Kerr acknowledged these are the dog days of the NBA season, especially given Golden State's struggles with injuries and subsequently losses. ""Nothing about this season has been expected or normal,"" Kerr said. ""We have just dealt with a lot of injuries and a lot of difficulty coming in, not really knowing quite what to expect. ... The main thing is our young guys are really playing hard and competing."" LAST WORD ""They are having a really special season when you think about it. From where they started and it being (coach Taylor Jenkins') first year to where they are now and what they've done the last few weeks is really impressive. ...They are one of the best stories in the league this year."" -- Kerr on the Grizzlies.","401161230"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets put an ugly loss behind them with a statement win over a top-tier team. Nikola Jokic had 20 points and 15 rebounds, and the Nuggets withstood a big rally to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 114-104 on Sunday night. This bounce-back performance was just what they needed to soothe their psyche after a clunker the night before against a struggling Cleveland squad. ""We looked like a totally different team less than 24 hours later,"" guard Monte Morris said. The moral was easy to decipher: ""We have to come to play against teams we're supposed to beat,"" Morris said. ""Because we always show up against teams we know that can beat us."" Trailing by as many 20 points in the second half, Los Angeles had pulled within six with 1:11 remaining when Patrick Beverley was called for a foul on Jokic. After the Nuggets big man made a pair of free throws, Clippers coach Doc Rivers argued with official Nick Buchert. He was given two technical fouls and tossed from the game. Jamal Murray hit both free throws to restore some much-needed breathing room. ""Listen, coaches can lose their composure, so can officials,"" Rivers explained. ""There's no way I should have been thrown out of the game."" Rivers had simply reached his boiling point. He was still seething from a crucial call earlier in the quarter when Montrezl Harrell got whistled for an offensive charge when he stepped in front of Jerami Grant as Grant guarded Kawhi Leonard. The Clippers were in the midst of a 10-0 run at the time. ""The pick was solid,"" Rivers said. ""The bottom line is I shouldn't get a tech. That's No. 1. That's on me."" Murray finished with 19 points and reserve Michael Porter Jr. provided a spark by scoring 13 for the Nuggets, who made their last field goal with 6:12 remaining. They went 9 of 10 on free throws from there. The defensive standout of the game was Grant, who had two big blocks on Leonard. ""A couple of great blocks at the rim you don't see very often against Kawhi,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Leonard finished with 30 points, while Lou Williams had 26 and Harrell added 25. The Clippers played without star forward Paul George, who missed a second straight game with a strained left hamstring. Los Angeles dropped to 8-6 this season when George doesn't play. This contest marked the first of three between two of the upper echelon teams in the Western Conference. Gary Harris showed signs of breaking out of a shooting slump by scoring 15 points but didn't play late. He's been diligently working on his jumper after shooting 25.6% over his last four games. He was 5 of 9 against the Clippers. ""When he makes shots, the guys need to chase him and it's a little different story,"" said Jokic, whose team led by as many as 20 points in the second half. Denver had quite a sequence midway through the fourth when Will Barton blocked a shot and Jokic grabbed the rebound. He quickly threw it ahead to Barton, who then dished it off to Morris for a 3-pointer. Denver was up 18 and seemingly cruising along before the Clippers made things interesting down the stretch. ""The focus was there. The energy was there,"" Jokic said. ""It was a big victory for us."" TIP-INS Clippers: George remained back in Los Angeles to receive more treatment on his hamstring. ""We'll just keep evaluating,"" Rivers said when asked about an update. ... Considered day to day with a knee injury, F JaMychal Green played more than 17 minutes and scored two points. Nuggets: F Paul Millsap missed a third straight game with a bruised left knee. ... The Nuggets outrebounded the Clippers. They're 18-2 when outrebounding a team. ... Morris finished with 12 points. ... Malone earned win No. 200 with the Nuggets. SECOND QUARTER TAKEOFF The tide turned in the second quarter when the Nuggets outscored the Clippers by a 37-22 margin. Harris scored 12 of his 15 points in the stretch. ""We played pretty consistent for three quarters,"" Leonard said. ""We've got to put all four together."" DEFENDING JOKIC Rivers said the 7-foot Jokic presents a difficult challenge given his versatility. ""Post-ups, he's great. Passing, he's great. Shooting, he's great,"" Rivers said. ""Not a lot of weaknesses there. Just got to guard him hard.""","401161231"
"PHOENIX --  When their offense misfired early and the Phoenix Suns trailed by 14 points in the second quarter, they turned up the heat on defense. It spurred the Suns to 100-92 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, and the first sweep of a season series with them since the 2013-2014 season. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 25 points and tied a career high with 15 rebounds. He made his presence felt on defense with three steals and two blocked shots, and had 15 points in the second half on a night when Suns star guard Devin Booker struggled from the floor, shooting just 3 of 12. Booker finished with 12 points, nine assists and seven turnovers. Deandre Ayton added 18 points and nine rebounds for Phoenix, which has won five of its last eight games. Kelly's a guy who plays 40 minutes and you look at him and he doesn't look tired at all, Suns coach Monty Williams said. We don't run a ton of plays for him, and yet he ends up with 25 points because he just plays hard and he's learning to play with the group. Dwayne Bacon scored 24 points for the Hornets, who have lost four straight and 10 of their last 12 games. Devonte Graham added 22 points and eight assists. Bacon's layup and free throw with 1:44 left cut the Suns' lead to 89-87. Ayton put the Suns up 91-87 with a layup, and Oubre picked up a loose ball and dunked with 45 seconds left for a 93-87 lead. The Hornets couldn't recover. We didn't fold when they made their run,"" Oubre said. We stuck to our game plan all night and we got the win. Ayton threw down a dunk off a lob from Booker with 3:53 to go in the first quarter for a 14-11 lead, but the Hornets closed the quarter on a 13-4 run for a 24-18 lead. Bacon scored seven of his teams first 12 points to give Charlotte a 36-22 lead, its largest of the game. Bacon had 13 points in the first half. Our defense gave us a great shot to win this game, Hornets coach James Borrego said. We had three starters go 3 for 22, most nights that's not going to get you an NBA win. So we stick together, heads up and move forward. The Suns appeared to lack energy early on, but got going with a 13-1 run in the second quarter. Oubre blocked a shot at one end and put in a layup at the other in a span of six seconds, making it 37-35. Dario Saric's 3 tied the score at 42, and Ayton dunked with 1:51 left for a 46-45 lead. Ayton had 12 first-half points. Neither team scored from that point on until halftime. Oubre's 3-pointer gave the Suns a 63-56 lead with 4:39 left in the third, but Bacons layup with 13 seconds remaining tied it at 71 going into the fourth quarter. We kept saying this is where we want to be, Graham said. But they made more plays late in the game. TIP-INS Hornets: C Bismack Biyombo left in the second quarter after being hit in the nose, but later returned.  Borrego, on the Hornets at the midway point of their season having played 41 games entering Sunday: The second half of the year is about growth and opportunity and experience, and I think when all those things mesh together, it provides us a bright future. ... G Terry Rozier's streak of five games with 20 or more points ended with five Sunday. Suns: Ayton gave Suns fans a scare when he went down and grabbed his left ankle after a botched lob just before halftime. But the 2018 No. 1 overall pick got back up and stayed in the game.  Booker made the 595th 3 of his career, moving him into sixth place on the Suns' all-time made 3-pointers list. ... Aron Baynes started his 12th straight game at center, with Ayton coming off the bench again. OFFICIAL ASSIST Dedric Taylor, one of the games officials, got an important assist during a first-quarter timeout when he rushed over to help a small child lift up a heavy sign. The crowd cheered, Taylor got a high five from the little one and a pat on the back from the Suns mascot, The Gorilla. ZELLER JAM The play of the night was a fast-break lob from Graham to Cody Zeller for a two-handed dunk with 5:37 to go in the third quarter, making the score 60-56 Suns. Zeller had 15 points in the 400th game of his NBA career.","401161232"
"Stephen A. Smith doesn't see the Pelicans adding true big name talent to their roster to win a NBA title, even with Zion Williamson there. (1:14) DETROIT --  A makeshift New Orleans Pelicans lineup blew a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter on Monday. Lonzo Ball helped his teammates salvage the night. Ball scored five of his 17 points in overtime and the Pelicans beat the Detroit Pistons 117-110. ""That was a tough game,"" Ball said. ""We kind of lost it in the fourth quarter, but we got it back in overtime and ended up with a good win."" The Pistons are still missing starters Blake Griffin (knee), Luke Kennard (knee) and Reggie Jackson (back), while the Pelicans played without their top three scorers -- Brandon Ingram (knee), Jrue Holiday (elbow) and JJ Redick (hamstring) -- along with Derrick Favors (hamstring) and Zion Williamson (knee). ""Over the course of the NBA season, guys are going to get an opportunity,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""The question is whether or not they take advantage. Tonight, everyone we put in the lineup did that. This was just a great team effort."" Along with the injuries, Pistons coach Dwane Casey benched Andre Drummond for the fourth quarter and overtime, playing Christian Wood for the final 20:23. Casey also went with youngsters Svi Mykhailiuk and Sekou Doumbouya down the stretch. ""In a situation like that, we're looking for five or six men who are playing hard and who can finish the game for us,"" Casey said. ""It wasn't a message for Andre as much as a message for everyone who wasn't on the floor. The young guys were playing hard and earned the right to be out there."" Detroit, which trailed by 16 with 11 minutes to play, tied the game at 100 on Derrick Rose's bank shot with 30 seconds left. E'Twaun Moore missed two short jumpers, giving Detroit the ball with 14 seconds remaining. That gave Rose a chance to replicate his game-winner on Dec. 9 in New Orleans, but he missed at the buzzer. ""It was the same play we ran down there when Derrick won it for us,"" Casey said. ""He got to his sweet spot again, but this one rimmed out."" The Pelicans opened overtime with a 9-2 run, including five points from Ball, and Rose had two turnovers in the last 90 seconds. ""I thought Frank (Jackson) did a great job on Rose,"" Gentry said. ""He did a really good job of being physical and keeping him out of the exact spot he wanted to be."" New Orleans has won three of four and is now 9-4 after a 6-22 start. Jalil Okafor had 25 points and 14 rebounds while Nicolo Melli scored 20 points and Moore had 16. The Pistons lost their third straight and their 12th in the last 15 games. Rose had 23 points and eight assists, while Wood added 18 points and nine rebounds. Doumbouya scored 16 points, matching a his career best. Okafor had 19 points and eight rebounds as the Pelicans took a 63-52 halftime lead. ""My teammates were really urging me on, and once I saw the ball going in, I got into a good rhythm,"" he said. ""My confidence was through the roof."" Okafor, though, only had six points after halftime. ""Ja likes to play with his back to the basket and shoot that little jump hook, and he was hitting everything in the first half,"" Wood said. ""I tried to make him shoot jumpers from further out and that helped."" Detroit narrowed the gap to seven at the start of the third, but Melli answered with a 3-pointer. The Pelicans kept the gap in double figures for the rest of the quarter, going into the fourth with an 89-77 lead. Doumbouya's transition dunk cut it to 97-91 with 6:05 left, and Rose followed with a layup in traffic. Josh Hart and Wood traded 3-pointers, and another layup by Rose pulled the Pistons within 100-98. TIP INS Pelicans: With the Pelicans short-handed, rookie Zylon Cheatham entered the rotation as part of coach Alvin Gentry's second unit. He played 11 minutes, scoring two points in his third NBA game. Pistons: Guard Jordan Bone, who came into the game with six NBA minutes over three games, was inserted into the game in the first quarter as part of a three-guard second unit. Bone finished with no points in eight first-half minutes. PISTONS STRUGGLE ON GLASS The Pelicans dominated on the boards at both ends of the floor, pulling down 90% of Detroit's missed shots and 31% of their own misses. ""I don't think that was all hustle, because they are longer than us at a lot of positions. When we go small, we're really small,"" Casey said. ""But they did a good job and we need our guards to be better at getting long rebounds.""","401161233"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  When the Indiana Pacers were struggling offensively Monday, T.J. Warren bailed them out. He did it defensively, too. Warren blocked a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 29 seconds left, and the Pacers scored the final seven points for a 101-95 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. ""Defensively, I've been more confident on that end,"" Warren said. ""I just made the big play when I could and the result was a win."" Indiana has now beaten the 76ers twice in 14 days and holds the No. 5 spot in the Eastern Conference standings, a half-game ahead of Philadelphia. And yet in a game Malcolm Brogdon finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, and Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis both produced double-doubles, it was Warren's energy, ability to get to the rim and a critical defensive play that proved the difference. ""I think we just locked in on the defensive end,"" Turner said. ""I think that was really the story of the night."" It wasn't anything like Indiana's 115-97 rout on New Year's Eve. This time, just about everyone on both teams struggled through three dreadful quarters. Warren and Ben Simmons were the exceptions. While Simmons finished the first half 9 of 11 from the field and staked the 76ers to a 49-40 halftime lead, Warren made just enough shots to keep the Pacers close. It looked like that might change when the 76ers ran out to a 63-52 lead midway through the third quarter. But Turner led the Pacers back with a 15-4 spurt to tie the score. Josh Richardson started to swing the game with a 17-point, fourth-quarter flurry that included two free throws to give the 76ers a 92-89 lead with 3:36 left. Instead, his 3 to make it 95-94 with 2:02 to go accounted for the only Philadelphia points the rest of the game. Turner made two free throws with 1:14 to go to give Indiana the lead, Warren kept it intact by blocking Tobias Harris' 3 and the Pacers closed it out at the free throw line. Simmons had 24 points and 14 rebounds, while Richardson finished with 23 points as Philadelphia fell to 1-2 since losing Joel Embiid with an injured finger on his left hand. ""We just have to make more open looks,"" Harris said. ""I think, all around, we haven't shot it well from 3 so we've got to stick with it. At the same time, we've make more of the shots we're getting."" TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons recorded his 21st double-double of the season. ... Harris had 15 points and 10 rebounds, his sixth double-double. ... Al Horford had 10 points and eight rebounds. ... Philadelphia fell to 1-2 in the season series. ... Richardson is 21 of 23 on free throws in his last four games. ... The 76ers had a 50-32 scoring advantage in the paint. Pacers: Turner and Justin Holiday each had 14 points. Turner also had 10 rebounds. ... Warren had his fourth 20-point game of the season. ... Brogdon returned after missing eight of the previous nine games with a sore lower back and strep throat. ... Sabonis returned after missing one game with a sore left knee. Sabonis had 10 points and 16 rebounds. ... Brogdon and Sabonis were a combined 8 of 27 from the field. BIG DIFFERENCE There's no question the 76ers are a different team without Embiid. So coach Brett Brown is willing to take the challenge head on. Last week, he tried All-Star point guard Simmons in the post. On Monday, he canceled the pregame shootaround so they could contemplate more thoroughly what they needed to do to beat the Pacers on the road. ""We're still figuring some stuff out, like what's life like without Joel,"" Brown said. ""We miss him terribly but when we do absorb him back into the mix, I hope we have some momentum built up."" QUOTABLE 76ers: ""I think we had great energy to start then we started fouling too much,"" Simmons said. ""Too many guys were getting open, hot guys who were knocking down shots."" Pacers: ""There was definitely rust,"" Brogdon said. ""But I've got really patient teammates that continue to feed me, continue to trust me even though I'm not shooting a good percentage.""","401161234"
"BOSTON --  Jayson Tatum didnt hesitate when asked about the teams chemistry nearly halfway into the season. Its a lot of fun when everybodys contributing. Guys are genuinely happy for one anothers success, he said after the Boston Celtics coasted to a 113-101 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday night. Tatum scored 21 points and Jaylen Brown had 19 to lead six Celtics in double figures. Questioned a lot last season about the teams chemistry with former guard Kyrie Irving as its leader, the under-achieving Celtics of last season didnt exactly react quickly most of the time with guys being genuinely happy about each others play. Enes Kanter had 15 points and nine rebounds, Kemba Walker added 14 points and Marcus Smart had 12 points for Boston (27-11), which won its second straight after a season-high three-game losing streak. Grant Williams added 11 points and Smart had eight assists. Gordon Hayward chipped in with eight points, eight assists and six boards for Boston despite shooting just 4 of 11 from the floor. I thought he was really good in the first half, coach Brad Stevens said of Hayward. Its really important that he leads us with his reads and passing. Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 30 points, including a couple of highlight dunks. Thaddeus Young added 17 points for Chicago (14-27), which has lost seven of eight. At halftime, we were disappointed in how we played. I thought we picked it up in the second half. I thought we came out, competed, Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. We talked about winning the third quarter and we talked about winning the second half. That would help us win the game. We didnt win the game, but we won the third quarter and we won the second half, so well try to build off that. The Bulls trailed by 55-37 at halftime, but came out with a 17-5 run over the initial 4 minutes of the second half. LaVine had six points in the spree. They just came out and jumped on us early on their home floor, LaVine said. Chicago cut its large deficit at intermission to six points twice in the third, the last 67-61 on Kris Dunns 3-pointer from directly in front of Bostons bench, but the Celtics closed the quarter with an 8-2 spurt to take an 83-71 edge into the fourth. The Bulls never really threatened in the final quarter. They closed it to 95-84 with just under 6 minutes to play on Daniel Gaffords put-back basket, but never tested Boston. TIP-INS Bulls: C Gafford returned to the lineup after missing the last four games with a sprained left ankle.  C Wendell Carter Jr. missed his fourth straight with a sprained right ankle. Celtics: C Daniel Theis missed the game with right knee soreness.  G Marcus went to the floor early in the second quarter after banging his left knee into Ryan Arcidiaconos right knee. Smart got up slowly after a short delay, but stayed in the game. He also was limping later in the quarter. SALES PITCH The Celtics handed out small posters of Walker, Brown and Tatum to the fans, with their stats on the front, asking them to vote for the three for the All-Star game. Williams took it further, holding one of each player in front of him postgame before looking into the cameras and telling the media: If all them make it, Ill be dying my hair pink for a month. Asked the shade, he replied: I will let the fans choose what pink Id dye my hair. It can be the brightest pink in the world or the darkest pink. If all three of them make it, itll happen. TOTAL CONTROL The Celtics only trailed once in the game -- 6-4 in the opening quarter -- and that was just for 22 seconds. They opened their first double-digit lead (21-9) on Walkers 3 and shot 52.5 % in the opening quarter (21 of 40) en route to a 28-14 lead at the break.","401161235"

""Coach had challenged me before the game to fill up the stat sheet more and do more things,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""Because he thought, as well as myself thought, that I was more capable of what I was doing.""

The Blazers, who led by as many as 17 points in the first half before Charlotte closed the gap and took a third-quarter lead, have won their last six games against the Hornets. Tolliver's 3-pointer put Portland up 102-94 but Dwayne Bacon answered with a 3 for the Hornets to keep it close. Cody Zeller's layup pulled Charlotte within 109-107 with just over 3 minutes to go and P.J. Washington made a pair of free throws to tie it. Tolliver's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 112-109 with 2:11 left before Carmelo Anthony had a key steal and Lillard made a layup. But Devonte' Graham's 3-pointer got the Hornets within two points. Lillard made the first of a pair of free throws for a slight cushion, and Graham's 3-pointer in a scramble at the buzzer was blocked by Kent Bazemore. Terry Rozier slipped trying to get open. Both teams have been struggling to start the new year. Portland currently sits at 11th in the Western Conference while the Hornets are in ninth in the East. Rozier had 27 points for the Hornets, who were coming off a 100-92 loss at Phoenix the night before. Monday's game was the third of a four-game road trip. It's stressful. It hurts and it should hurt, Hornets coach James Borrego said. But this is only going to make us stronger, more resilient. Our guys are showing growth in these moments. Tolliver said his fourth quarter was all about persistence. That's who I am, that's what's allowed me to play in the league as long as I have, he said. Just being able to stay with it, no matter what the circumstances are. Trusting my work, trusting my faith and just being able to go out there and play with a lot of confidence whether I'm 0 for 5 or 5 for 5. Hassan Whiteside was back in Portland's starting lineup after missing Saturday's loss to Milwaukee because of a respiratory illness. But Mario Hezonja missed the game because of a sore back. Borrego started Zeller at center for Bismack Biyombo, who did not play. The teams appeared to be fairly evenly matched through the first quarter, but Portland began to pull away midway through the second, when McCollum's driving layup made it 43-37. Gary Trent Jr. capped an 11-0 Portland run with a 3-pointer that put the Blazers ahead 52-37. The Blazers took a 62-46 lead into the break, led by McCollum with 20 points in 16 minutes. The Hornets hit four straight 3-pointers to open the second half, closing the gap to 62-58. McCollum's 3 ended the run. Graham's 3-pointer got the Hornets within 67-66, but they couldnt pull ahead until Willy Hernangomez's layup made it 80-78. Charlotte made nine 3-pointers in the third quarter alone. Lillard's heave from more than 40 feet out gave the Blazers a 91-89 lead to start the final quarter. That's a good way to finish off the quarter -- it was a rough quarter, Lillard said. We allowed them to shoot a bunch of 3s and that's not how we want to lose the lead, but it happened and we just had to find a way. And we did that. TIP INS: Hornets: It was the first of two meetings between the teams. The Blazers visit Charlotte on March 24. ... The Hornets have not beaten the Blazers since January 2017. The team has not won in Portland since March 2008 -- a streak of 12 games. Trail Blazers: The game ended Portland's short two-game homestand, with the next three on the road. ... Guy Fieri was at Monday's game. ... Lillard had 14 points in the third quarter alone. ... Tolliver also had 11 rebounds. BIG QUARTER The Hornets had 43 points in the third quarter, the most the Blazers had allowed in a quarter all season. I would imagine giving up nine 3-pointers is the most 3s we've given up in a quarter as well, Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. To be able to withstand that, I'm just glad we had a cushion.","401161237"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Orlando Magic made a pair of costly defensive mistakes in the final 80 seconds. Evan Fournier's quick change of mind and a big shot by Aaron Gordon more than made up for it. Gordon made a three-point play with 1.1 seconds remaining, and the Magic beat the Sacramento Kings 114-112 on Monday night. ""That's a terrific win,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""That to me was more of a win where we fought like hell and made big plays at the end than it was a lot of stuff that you're going to look at and say we're on our way."" Gordon and Fournier made it possible with their freelancing at the end. De'Aaron Fox put the Kings ahead 112-111 with a three-point play with 15 seconds left. After a timeout, Orlando inbounded the ball to Fournier, who went up for a shot at the right elbow before passing down low to Gordon. ""I got to my spot but I saw two bodies in the air,"" Fournier said. ""I was literally about to shoot and I saw AG and I had to pass it."" Facing a double-team and with his back to the basket, Gordon flipped the ball up and in. He was fouled by Cory Joseph and made the ensuing free throw to give the Magic their fifth win in seven games. ""I was going to rebound. I thought Evan was going to shoot it but he made a great play,"" Gordon said. ""It was a good pass and I just put it on the rim. It went in. Evan did the hard part. He set the whole play up."" Gordon finished with 19 points and nine rebounds in his return to Orlando's lineup after missing one game with calf tightness. Nikola Vucevic had 26 points and 15 rebounds, and Fournier scored 25 points. Gordon's game-winner came after the Magic blew a pair of defensive assignments down the stretch. ""What was disappointing is (those) plays are just blown coverages on stuff we covered in detail ad nauseam this morning,"" Clifford said. ""Should have never happened."" Fox had 31 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds for Sacramento. Nemanja Bjelica set career highs with 34 points and eight 3-pointers. ""Orlando knocked down shots and made plays down the stretch,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""You don't want to come down to these one-point games because crazy things happen. You have to take care of business before that."" Fournier struggled with his shot all night but went 12 for 12 on free throws. Orlando was 25 for 30 from the line while Sacramento was 10 of 11. Vucevic and Fournier had 15 points apiece in the first half to offset Bjelica's 22 before the break. Orlando led by eight after the first quarter and was up 65-52 at halftime. The Magic were up by 10 midway through the third but went cold, while the Kings heated up. Marvin Bagley III scored eight straight, Buddy Hield made a 3-pointer and Trevor Ariza followed with a layup to cut Orlando's lead to 86-85. TIP-INS Magic: D.J. Augustin had six points after sitting out Friday's loss to Phoenix because of a left knee contusion. It was the first game that Augustin has missed this season. . Vucevic had a double-double before halftime. Kings: Bjelica made his first four shots and was 8 of 9 with a banked-in 3-pointer late in the second quarter. . Richaun Holmes (right shoulder) and Bogdan Bogdanovic (right ankle) were held out.","401161238"
"LeBron James praises Dwight Howard and the other Lakers bigs for being able to knock down 3-pointers though he only wants to see that when they are up by alot. (0:42) LOS ANGELES --  Kevin Love and LeBron James hadn't played against each other since before they got together on the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 for a memorable four-year partnership. After their first meeting since James moved to the West Coast ended in a blowout win for the Lakers, they got together on court with Tristan Thompson to renew a friendship that's bigger than the game. ""That's a brotherhood,"" Love said. ""That's a bond that can never be broken. You saw Tristan and myself out there with him. That's something we'll always remember and kind of take to our graves. He's my brother for life, and it is weird playing against him."" These three champions' connection is rock-solid, even after a game that demonstrated why only James is contending for another ring this year. James scored 23 of his 31 points in a dominant second half, and Dwight Howard added season highs of 21 points and 15 rebounds in Los Angeles' ninth consecutive victory, 128-99 over the Cavs on Monday night. The powerhouse Lakers posted their highest-scoring half in 33 years while scoring 81 in the second half behind James, who added eight assists while passing Isiah Thomas for sole possession of eighth place on the NBA's career list. James led Los Angeles to its third straight win without Anthony Davis, who is out with a bruised backside. ""Defensively, we got stops, and we had great pace,"" James said. ""Even when they scored, we got the ball out and continued to play with pace. We played with a lot of balance."" James hasn't been gone from Cleveland long enough to forget about his connection with Love or his spirited practice competitions with Thompson. The Cavaliers who stayed behind recognize their old teammate's steady brilliance, but they also see the improved aspects to James' ever-evolving game. Thompson guarded James for long stretches, just like he would in scrimmages back in Cleveland. James still went 12 for 16, and he quarterbacked the Lakers' up-tempo offense to perfection in the second half. ""He made some 3s to get himself going, but he did a good job of getting his teammates involved,"" Thompson said. ""I accept the challenge. It's fun playing against the best player of our generation, and probably one of the best of all time. I love it."" Love had 21 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland in the third stop of a six-game road stretch. Two days after the Cavs posted a surprising win at powerhouse Denver, they couldn't keep up with a franchise icon who hasn't slowed down. Returning from a one-game absence with an apparent case of the flu, James improved to 2-0 against the Cavaliers since he departed for the second time in 2018. James had 32 points and 14 rebounds in his return to Cleveland in November 2018, and he was injured last January when the Cavs beat the Lakers at Staples Center. Thompson had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, while Collin Sexton and Darius Garland added 16 points apiece. Cleveland jumped to a 14-point lead in the first half while most of the Lakers played listlessly, but Los Angeles ran away from the middle of the second quarter onward. ""When the pendulum began to swing, we couldn't stop it,"" Cleveland coach John Beilein said. ""LeBron took charge, just like he always has for a long time."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Former Lakers F Larry Nance Jr. missed his sixth straight game with left knee soreness, but Beilein is hopeful Nance will return during their road trip. ... Beilein said he has known for ""a couple of weeks"" that first-round pick Dylan Windler would miss the entire season due to a stress reaction in his lower left leg. The Cavaliers announced Windler's yearlong absence Monday. ""Would have been a great addition for us,"" Beielein said. ""Feel bad for him, but he'll be almost like another first-round draft pick next season."" Lakers: Veteran G Rajon Rondo also missed the game with an injured finger. ... James and Avery Bradley both played despite the flu. Bradley scored 12 points. ... Danny Green had 10 points in his return from a one-game absence with a sore right hip. AD'S PROGRESS Davis is close to returning after his scary fall last week in a home game against New York, coach Frank Vogel said. The six-time All-Star missed the Lakers' road games at Dallas and Oklahoma City last weekend, and his return could depend on his pain tolerance. Davis felt good enough to make a quick trip Sunday to Lambeau Field, where he and JaVale McGee watched the Packers beat the Seahawks. Davis is a Chicago native, but he wore an Aaron Rodgers jersey to support Green Bay. Vogel said his players cleared the trip with the Lakers, who had the day off Sunday and didn't hold a shootaround Monday morning. LEBRON'S ASSISTS James, passed Thomas with his 9,062nd assist during the third quarter. He is the NBA's leader with a career-best 10.7 assists per game while molding himself into a virtuoso playmaker alongside Davis. DWIGHT'S DOMINANCE Howard capped another outstanding game in his bounce-back season with his ninth career 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. ""He was a monster tonight,"" Vogel said.","401161239"
"ATLANTA --  Kevin Huerter says he has no idea when Trae Young is about to go on one of his hot streaks. The latest scoring spree for the Atlanta point guard was especially well-timed. Young scored 21 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter and the Hawks pulled away late to beat the Phoenix Suns 123-110 on Tuesday night. ""Any shot Trae takes looks good to us,"" Huerter said. ""He hit probably two 30-footers. When he's making those, he's tough to guard."" Devin Booker led the Suns with 39 points before he was ejected for his second technical foul following his dunk with less than two minutes remaining. Young had only 15 points before more than doubling his total in the final period for his 20th game with at least 30 points this season. He is averaging 29.1 points per game. ""You have to have a closer in this league and you have to be able to execute in the fourth quarter,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. For Atlanta, saddled with the NBA's worst record, there has been far too little fourth-quarter execution this season. That changed against the Suns, when the Hawks made 12 of 19 shots, including five of eight 3-pointers, in the final period. Young hit four of seven 3s in the final 12 minutes. ""He's been doing that since high school,"" said Suns center Deandre Ayton, who had 20 points and 10 rebounds. Young got help from Huerter, his backcourt partner. Huerter scored 23 points and set career highs with 15 rebounds and eight assists. ""I was trying to be aggressive,"" he said. John Collins added 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Hawks, who snapped a four-game losing streak. Led by Young, the Hawks pulled away in the final period after briefly losing their lead in the third. Young's 3-pointer gave Atlanta a 95-92 lead it did not relinquish. Each team made lineup adjustments. Suns guard Ricky Rubio did not accompany the team to Atlanta for personal reasons. Phoenix coach Monty Williams, unhappy with his team's play, ripped off his tie following the game. ""I thought our offense just sputtered tonight,"" he said. ""Certainly not having Ricky on the floor hurt. ... But we had chances. The ball movement certainly wasn't there."" The Hawks had few options inside as centers Alex Len (lower back pain) and Bruno Fernando did not play. Atlanta was boosted by Young's return after missing one game with a sore left hamstring. After leading 56-51 at halftime, Atlanta opened the second half with a 12-4 run. Collins sank a 3-pointer for a 68-55 lead. The Hawks stretched the lead to 75-61 on another 3 from Collins. Phoenix rallied late in the third to take its first lead of the second half, 81-80, on Cameron Johnson's three-point play. TIP-INS Suns: Elie Okobo missed his only four shots and had three assists in his second start of the season as Rubio's fill-in. ... Booker made all 13 of his free throws. ... Mikal Bridges had 15 points. Hawks: Fernando arrived in Atlanta on Tuesday morning following a 20-hour flight from his native Angola. He missed his fourth game following his mother's death. ... Hawks Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins was given a cake courtside to celebrate his 60th birthday on Sunday. EJECTED Williams didn't agree with Booker's ejection. ""There's taunting going on all game,"" Williams said, adding he thought the ejection was ""silly."" ""That's what I told the ref. That's a tough one to take,"" he added. Booker said that after his jam he only said: ""I can do that every time."" He called the exchange of trash talk ""average NBA game talk."" STAYING ALIVE With his team missing two centers, Pierce said his biggest concern was having Collins and Damian Jones get into foul trouble as the team's primary available inside players. Collins finished with five fouls. Jones, who had 11 points, had three fouls.","401161240"
"NEW YORK --  Rudy Gobert is a two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as good a stopper as there is in the league. Even he wouldn't want to mess with the Utah Jazz right now. ""I wouldn't like to guard ourselves,"" he said. The Brooklyn Nets didn't enjoy it, either. Joe Ingles matched his career high with 27 points, Gobert had 22 points and 18 rebounds, and the Jazz ran their winning streak to 10 games by beating the Nets 118-107 on Tuesday night. Donovan Mitchell returned from a one-game absence with an illness to score 25 points -- 14 in the fourth quarter -- and Bojan Bogdanovic had 18 for the Jazz, who opened a 20-point lead and impressively turned back every attempt by the Nets to make it close. ""We're in a groove,"" Mitchell said. Kyrie Irving had 32 points and a season-high 11 assists in his second game back from a shoulder injury, but it mostly seemed he was trying to shoot the Nets back into a game the Jazz weren't going to let go of in what became their 15th win in 16 games. ""You look at them on film and watch a few of their games and there's a reason why they're 15-1 in their last 16,"" Irving said. The Nets were coming off their best defensive performance of the season, allowing season lows in points and field goal percentage (33%) in a 108-86 rout of Atlanta. But they could never get comfortable against a Jazz team that had Gobert rolling inside and plenty of good shooters on the outside. Ingles was 6 of 8 behind the arc and finished 10 of 14 overall, capitalizing on the space created by defenders worrying about Gobert near the rim or Mitchell attacking it. ""The bigs were so far back tonight it was kind of just like practice shots,"" Ingles said. ""Rudy was hitting great screens and we were able to kind of walk into it and shoot open 3s."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 17 points for the Nets, who had won two in a row. Both teams started quickly, the Jazz opening 8 of 12 from the field and the Nets 7 of 10. But eventually Utah's defense began to assert itself. Dinwiddie was 0 for 4 from the free throw line in the first half, though the Nets scored on his first attempts when the Jazz accidentally batted the ball into the basket. Rodions Kurucs, as the closest Nets player, was given credit for the field goal. Brooklyn could have tied it when Dinwiddie went to the line the second time. His two misses left Utah leading 45-43, and Ingles then hit three 3-pointers in a 14-2 burst to end the half and give the Jazz a 59-45 advantage. The Jazz made four 3s in about four minutes to start the second half, with the last one by Ingles pushing the lead to 76-56. Brooklyn cut it to eight midway through the fourth after six straight points, but Gobert converted a three-point play and Mitchell nailed a 3 to extend it to 105-91. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah has won the last four meetings. ... Jordan Clarkson scored 13 points off the bench. Nets: The Nets played without reserves Garrett Temple (bruised right knee) and Wilson Chandler (left hamstring). ... Brooklyn began a difficult five-game stretch that continues with a game Wednesday in Philadelphia and includes matchups with Milwaukee, the 76ers again and the Los Angeles Lakers. Coach Kenny Atkinson had no special feelings about the rough road because he said all games are tough. ""I'm focusing on the Nets and us improving. Can't really control the schedule,"" he said. ""Just as nervous about this game as I was Atlanta (on Sunday). It doesn't really matter. I don't really look at the jersey. I just make sure we're prepared to compete at a high level."" ZION NEXT? Utah's next game is Thursday at New Orleans, where the Pelicans are hoping No. 1 draft pick Zion Williamson will be ready to make his NBA debut after a knee injury. He's been practicing but hasn't played in a game yet. ""Definitely fun to watch so for us it's going to be the same,"" Gobert said. ""Zion or no Zion, we're going in there to try to get a win and hopefully that's what we're going to do."" SECOND-ROUND SUCCESSES The game featured the top two current scoring leaders among second-round picks. Dinwiddie came in at 22.1 points per game and Bogdanovic, a former Net, was at 21.","401161241"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Early this season, the young Memphis Grizzlies were still learning how to close out games -- a shortfall the team has overcome during its longest winning streak in more than three years. The Grizzlies outscored the Houston Rockets 36-27 in the fourth quarter Tuesday night as Memphis pulled away for a 121-110 victory, stretching the Grizzlies' winning streak to six games -- their longest since December 2016. Rookie guard Ja Morant had 26 points and eight assists, and Dillon Brooks scored 24 to lead Memphis. Jonas Valanciunas added 19 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 15 despite going 6 of 16 from the floor. Morant missed only one of his 11 shots, becoming the first rookie in NBA history to score at least 25 points while handing out eight or more assists and shooting 90% or better from the field. ""Early on, we would get stagnant, and we would run the same thing over and over,"" Brooks said of the team's fourth-quarter problems earlier in the season. ""Now, we're getting more diversity with Ja getting to the middle and making great plays and great decisions."" Brooks also was responsible for guarding Rockets star James Harden, the NBA's leading scorer. Harden perhaps had more scoring duties against Memphis as backcourt mate Russell Westbrook sat out to rest on the opening night of a back-to-back. Harden scored 41 points, his fifth straight game against the Grizzlies surpassing 40. But he shot 13 of 37, including 5 of 19 from 3-point range. That included missing all seven shots in the fourth quarter as Memphis pulled away in the final eight minutes. ""There were little things,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Most importantly, we couldn't keep the Grizzlies in front of us. They finished very well at the rim on a lot of fast-break possessions. . We didn't do enough to stop them."" Eric Gordon finished with 23 points for Houston, and Clint Capela had 16 points and 16 rebounds. Capela said in games the Rockets have lost ""finishing defensively, we weren't good enough. Our goal is always to keep the team under 100 points, which didn't happen."" The teams were tied at 95 with about eight minutes left when the Grizzlies went on an 11-1 run fueled by 3-pointers from Solomon Hill, Brooks and Morant. That gave Memphis a 106-96 lead with five minutes remaining. The win left the Grizzlies clinging to eighth place in the Western Conference, a half-game ahead of the idle San Antonio Spurs. ""Every game is a statement game at this point,"" Jackson said, ""because you are playing for seeding, playing for the playoffs. Everybody is trying to work towards that, but definitely, when you're on a winning streak, it gives you a bit more energy."" TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook also sat out Houston's previous game at Memphis on Nov. 4, which was the second of a back-to-back. . With Westbrook out, Austin Rivers started at guard alongside Harden. Rivers was given the nod over Gordon. ""Someone has to chase Morant around, and I want Austin to do that,"" D'Antoni said before the game. ""Help save Eric's legs a little bit."" ... Capela has at least 10 rebounds in 25 of the past 26 games. ... The loss left D'Antoni one win short of 200 as coach of the Rockets. ... It was only the second time Houston has lost in 16 games when Harden scored at least 40 points this season. Grizzlies: F Jae Crowder sat out with right hip soreness. Kyle Anderson started in his place, his third start of the season. . Jackson has 13 straight games with multiple 3-pointers, tying Mike Miller for the franchise record. . Memphis has scored at least 110 points in 12 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA. GORDON MAKING PROGRESS Gordon's 23 points were a season high after the Rockets guard missed 22 games following right knee arthroscopy. He also sat out last Thursday's loss at Oklahoma City with right knee soreness. ""It's coming together,"" Gordon said. ""I want to continue to get better and better. . It's going to take some time. I'm getting better, the knee is getting better and I just have to get in some better shape.""","401161242"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo wasn't looking at the scoreboard. Even though the Milwaukee Bucks led by 25 points at halftime Tuesday night, the reigning MVP maintained his focus in the third quarter and put the finishing touches on a 128-102 victory over the New York Knicks. Antetokounmpo had 17 points in just more than six minutes as Milwaukee scored 43 in the period and romped past the Knicks, sweeping the three-game season series and improving to a league-best 36-6. ""I'm just trying to be aggressive and trying to make plays,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""When you come out with the mindset to make the lead go 20 or 30 or 40, that's when you mess up the lead. ""You've just got to keep doing your job, and then you look up and see you lead by 30. Then you're like, `OK, we did our job so now we can sit."" Antetokounmpo did all his work in just 21 minutes, sinking 12 of 17 field goal attempts and 10 of 12 free throws while adding nine rebounds and four assists. The highlight of his night was getting fouled on a 3-pointer in the third quarter, the first time that had happened to him since he was playing in the second division in Greece. Antetokounmpo made all three free throws after being fouled by Mitchell Robinson, and Khris Middleton added two more on the play when Elfrid Payton was issued two quick technical fouls and ejected from the game. ""It feels good,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's the first time it ever happened in the NBA. It was in Greece seven years ago. That made my day. But I definitely don't have that in my game yet. Let's just stay humble here."" Middleton added 17 points and Ersan Ilyasova had 14 points and seven rebounds for Milwaukee, which led by as many as 35. Julius Randle had 25 points and 15 rebounds to pace the Knicks (11-30), and rookie R.J. Barrett added 22 points. Bobby Portis had 20 off the bench. Barrett was impressed by Antetokounmpo. ""He's ridiculous,"" Barrett said. ""He's strong. He's fast. He's a tough cover, for sure. He's the Greek Freak. The things he can do are incredible. As a rookie, I'm just trying to figure out a way to beat him."" It was only the third time since 1985-86 that an NBA player scored 37 points or more in less than 22 minutes -- Paul George did it earlier this season for the Los Angeles Clippers and Quintin Dailey did it in 1986 for the Chicago Bulls. Antetokounmpo scored on a nifty drive and followed with a 3-pointer as part of a 10-0 run that gave the Bucks a 39-23 advantage early in the second quarter. Milwaukee outscored New York 36-17 in the period to grab a 65-40 halftime lead. Antetokounmpo finished the half with 20 points and eight rebounds. SHOOTING STAR Middleton is mixing up his offensive game, scoring effectively from the mid-range and beyond the 3-point line. At the season's halfway point he had an effective field goal percentage of 55.8% and an overall percentage of 48.5%. ""He took the challenge to be an even better shooter,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think we wanted him to be better on open looks. He's taking his concentration in a lot of different areas and just increased it."" Middleton is seeking his second straight NBA All-Star selection. TIP-INS Knicks: Signed forward Kenny Wooten to a two-way contract. The 6-foot-8 Wooten has appeared in 24 games this season for the Westchester Knicks of the G-League, averaging 7.7 points and 5.9 rebounds in 24 minutes per game. Knicks interim coach Mike Miller said he has been impressed with ""the athleticism and the energy and the force that he plays with."" . Marcus Morris missed his fifth straight game with a neck injury, and the Knicks also were without Frank Ntilikina (sore groin) and Dennis Smith Jr. (oblique strain). Bucks: Talk has turned to Milwaukee's chances of reaching 70 wins, after the team had 35 at the season's halfway mark. Only the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (72 wins) and 2015-16 Golden State Warriors (73) have eclipsed that mark. Those Warriors were outspoken about wanting to beat the Bulls' record. But it's not a subject Budenholzer is thinking about. ""We appreciate we've had a great start, but there's still a lot of work to do,"" he said. ""Defensively, individual pride, it feels like there are nights where we can't keep the ball in front of us. Offensively, our execution, both when we're playing motion and in the half-court stuff, we need to be better. That becomes more important in close games, in the playoffs."" . Backup center Robin Lopez sat out for rest, taking his turn in the team's plan to keep players fresh throughout the season. ...

"SAN FRANCISCO --  Dwight Powell and the Dallas Mavericks had little time to relish another impressive win against the Warriors on the road. It's off to the next stop on a back-to-back in Northern California -- a meeting with the Kings in Sacramento on Wednesday. Powell scored 21 points and was perfect from the floor in his return to the Bay Area after starring at Stanford, and the Mavericks beat the Golden State Warriors 124-97 on Tuesday night. ""The win is great but it's a quick, jam-packed road trip so we're on the bus ready to go for another one tomorrow,"" Powell said. Luka Doncic added 20 points and eight rebounds as the Mavericks won their fourth straight against the Warriors -- three in a row on their home floor. Powell shot 9 for 9 and grabbed six rebounds. Jordan Poole came off the bench to score 17 points for Golden State. Fellow reserve Eric Paschall added 16, while D'Angelo Russell and Glenn Robinson III had 13 apiece. The Warriors lost their eighth consecutive game and fourth straight at Chase Center. And injury-plagued Golden State lost another player when guard Jacob Evans III was taken to a hospital to be evaluated for a head injury. He was helped off the court with 4:38 left in the first half after getting hit with an elbow by Powell as they fought for a rebound. The Warriors trailed by as many as 28, then used a 13-0 run in the third quarter to make things interesting. ""I liked our concentration, effort and focus defensively,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We made enough plays on offense to get a lead and get out of here alive."" Dallas star Kristaps Porzingis, who had been listed as questionable, sat out an eighth straight game. He has been feeling ill and is still dealing with soreness in his right knee. Porzingis could be ready in time to face the Kings on Wednesday. ""With him being under the weather and the rehab of the knee, it's just the stars didn't align for tonight,"" Carlisle said before the game. ""Tomorrow night might be a possibility, but he's going to work out before and we will see where we are tomorrow."" Dallas made six of its first 12 shots from 3-point range -- three by Maxi Kleber -- and built a 28-18 lead while hitting 11 of its initial 20 shots overall. The Warriors started 8 for 20, with four baskets by Russell. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas has won the last three meetings by a combined 95 points, including 142-94 on Nov. 20 at home and 141-121 in San Francisco on Dec. 28. The Mavericks already had won the season series for the first time since taking two of three in 2011-12, but have now swept the regular-season matchups for the first time since winning all four in 2002-03. ... The Mavericks are 9-2 on the road vs. the Western Conference. Warriors: Golden State is expected to sign F Marquese Chriss as a two-way player Wednesday, just more than a week after he was waived by the team last Tuesday. There was a two-way spot open as Golden State worked to sign Damion Lee to a standard NBA contract after he expired his NBA service time allotment as a two-way player. Chriss will now split time with the Santa Cruz Warriors of the G League. The 22-year-old Chriss provided a boost for the injury-plagued Warriors after signing as a free agent in late September, averaging 7.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 17.7 minutes over 37 games with three starts. ... The Warriors are 5-9 against the West at home. THOMPSON'S TRIP Warriors star Klay Thompson will have his No. 1 jersey retired at Washington State on Saturday, traveling on owner Joe Lacob's private plane to Pullman, Washington, for the halftime ceremony when the Cougars host Oregon State. ""I haven't been back in about five years,"" Thompson said. ""To go back and see the people I really grew up with, the community that really embraced me, it's very nostalgic and it's just really cool because that was a dream of mine leaving Pullman. I didn't think it would ever come true and it did, so it's exciting."" Splash Brother Stephen Curry can't wait to go along, as well as Zaza Pachulia and Mike Dunleavy. General manager Bob Myers is scheduled for a surgery and won't make it. ""I heard it's pretty cool there,"" he said, then later added with a smile, ""Go Cougs!""","401161244"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard more than did his part to make sure the Los Angeles Clippers made quick work of the Cleveland Cavaliers. The All-Star forward scored a season-high 43 points in 28 minutes Tuesday night as the Clippers cruised to a 128-103 rout. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he became the third NBA player in the shot-clock era to score at least 43 points in under 29 minutes -- and the first in franchise history to have at least 40 points in less than 30 minutes. ""We had great ball movement and obviously I made shots tonight,"" said Leonard, who didn't play in the fourth quarter. ""The rest of the guys were making shots and they got me in my spots and opened the floor for me."" According to Sportradar, it was only the second time since 1996 a Clippers player scored at least 40 points in the first three quarters. Lou Williams had 40 against Golden State in a 2018 game. Leonard had 14 points in the second quarter and set a career high for 3-pointers in one period with four as the Clippers broke open the game. He finished two points from tying his regular-season career high, going 14 of 22 from the floor and 6 of 10 from beyond the arc. ""His pace was fantastic. When Kawhi is that efficient it is pretty impressive to watch,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Williams added 24 points for the Clippers, who played again without injured star Paul George. They have won five of six and had six scorers in double figures. ""We had the right mindset and the right spirit tonight, both ends playing the right way,"" said guard Landry Shamet, who scored 12 points. Collin Sexton led Cleveland with 25 points and Cedi Osman added 21. Rookie guard Darius Garland, the fifth overall pick in last June's draft, had 14 points and a career-high 10 assists for his first double-double. Cavaliers coach John Beilein thought Garland's double-double and Osman hitting five 3s were some positive things to take away despite his team's 10th loss by at least 20 points. ""There's a lot of things we look at and say OK, in any lopsided loss earlier in the year we didn't have those numbers,"" he said. ""The only thing we can do is find those growth areas. We know we are in transition."" Osman's 3-pointer gave the Cavs a 34-33 lead with 9:58 remaining in the second quarter before Los Angeles outscored them 33-16 the remainder of the half. The Clippers scored the final 13 points of the first half, including nine from Leonard. He closed the half by intercepting Osman's pass and going down the floor for a dunk while drawing a foul from Garland. Leonard's free throw completed the three-point play to put Los Angels up 66-50 at halftime. The Clippers' largest lead was 36 early in the fourth. THROWBACK NIGHT In a matchup of two franchises celebrating their 50th year, the Clippers wore their old Buffalo Braves uniforms. The team started in Buffalo before moving to San Diego in 1978 and changing its name to the Clippers. The club relocated to Los Angeles in 1984. The Cavaliers donned the uniforms they wore from 1994-2002, which was fitting since it was 1990s Night at Staples Center. ANOTHER LA REUNION Cleveland forward Tristan Thompson gave former coach Tyronn Lue a bearhug on the Clippers sideline before the game. Lue -- who was the coach when the Cavaliers won the NBA title in 2016 -- is in his first season as an assistant on Rivers' staff with the Clippers after he was fired by the Cavaliers six games into last season. ""I thought he was going to break him,"" Rivers said about the bearhug. ""With Tristan, Kevin (Love) and Matthew (Dellavedova), he was excited to see those guys. When they came in it was fun to see how they received him."" The Cavaliers faced LeBron James on Monday night for the third time since he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2018 offseason. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love got the night off with Cleveland playing back-to-back games. Love has played a back-to-back set only once this season. ... Dellavedova scored a season-high 14 points. ... Larry Nance Jr. returned to the lineup after missing the past seven games due to left knee soreness. He was scoreless in 19 minutes with three rebounds and four assists. Clippers: George missed his third straight game due to a strained left hamstring. Rivers did not have an update before the game on when the All-Star forward might be back. ... Ivica Zubac had 12 points and 11 rebounds for his sixth double-double of the season. ... Montrezl Harrell had 12 points and Patrick Beverley added 10. ... Maurice Harkless grabbed 11 rebounds. ... It was the 16th time Los Angeles scored at least 120 points this season, which is second in the NBA.","401161245"
"BOSTON --  The Pistons have been playing most of the past month without three starters. They didn't let it stop them from finding a way to get the best of one of the East's top teams. Rookie Sekou Doumbouya scored a season-high 24 points and Detroit snapped a three-game losing streak with a 116-103 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. Detroit continued to be without starters Reggie Jackson (back), Blake Griffin (left knee surgery) and Luke Kennard (knee tendinitis). But Doumbouya has begun to get more comfortable lately, reaching double figures in seven of his last eight games. I feel like normal, just played my game and not try to do too much,"" he said. Markieff Morris matched his season best with 23 points. Derrick Rose added 22 points and Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk had a season-high 21. The Pistons shot a season-best 60.3% from the field. Andre Drummond added 13 points and 13 rebounds to post his 34th double-double of the season. This is probably the best win we've had,"" Morris said. ""We've been struggling lately. To come out and compete like we did tonight, shows us we can play with anybody. The Pistons opened the fourth quarter with a 17-5 run, capped by a dunk by Drummond, to take a 108-87 lead with 7:05 to play. Boston never got closer than 12 after that. Shortly after coach Brad Stevens pulled his starters, Marcus Smart was called for a foul and ejected after arguing with an official. It was the conclusion of a night of frustration for Boston, which has lost four its last six. They played well from the beginning of the game, point guard Kemba Walker said. They came out extremely aggressive and focused. They took that one. Boston was without its second-leading scorer with Jayson Tatum sidelined because of soreness in his right knee. But he is expected to travel with the team for its anticipated matchup with conference leader Milwaukee on Thursday night. Smart started in his place. The Pistons took advantage with Tatum out. They used a 10-0 run, capped by 3-pointer by Mykhailiuk, to build 82-73 lead in the third quarter. He closed the period knocking down a buzzer-beater from just inside the half-court line. Rose hit his first four shots to help Detroit take an early 27-18 lead. The Celtics closed the gap led by Hayward, who connected on five of his first seven attempts in the first quarter. TIP-INS Pistons: Scored 18 points off 15 Boston turnovers. Celtics: Bench was outscored 47-23. SECOND-HALF OPTIMISM Wednesday marked the start of the second half of Detroit's schedule. Pistons coach Dwane Casey is hopeful it also bring some improved health for his team. Griffin and Kennard have been out since December and currently neither has a timetable to return to action. But Casey said Jackson is practicing and could be ready to come back any day now. We could sit here and make a lot of excuses. ... It's part of the NBA, Casey said. Now is the time for everybody who has the opportunity to make sure they take advantage of it."" INJURY UPDATE Stevens said he doesn't expect big man Robert Williams (left hip bone edema) to return anytime before the All-Star break. Williams hasn't played since Dec. 6. He was last checked out by doctors earlier this month and received a good report. He was put on an action plan that was scheduled to last about a month. Theyre going to see how his hip responds to that, rescan him and then determine the course of action from there, Stevens said. ""We were hopeful in the last scan, but were also very cautious with his recovery.

"Kyrie Irving speaks about the injuries the Nets have suffered this season, including not having Kevin Durant on the court at all. (1:18) PHILADELPHIA --  At the start of the season, the Philadelphia 76ers said that they would bank their NBA title hopes on a BullyBall formula of physical defense and inside presence. In a tight game in the fourth quarter on Wednesday night, that mixture worked to perfection. Tobias Harris scored 34 points, including two big baskets in the final two minutes that proved to be the difference, as the 76ers beat the Brooklyn Nets 117-106. The 76ers held the Nets to just 16 fourth-quarter points on 6-of-23 (26.1%) shooting. When we got together in the huddle before the fourth quarter, we said that we were going to have to hold them to under 20 points to win the game, said Harris, who scored 24 points in the second half on 9-of-13 shooting. On the offensive end, Philadelphia was 10 of 19 from the floor and took advantage of a three-guard lineup that Brooklyn was forced to use. Ben Simmons had 20 points and 11 assists for the 76ers, who improved to 19-2 at home. On the road, the 76ers are 7-14 and have lost six straight games -- a slide that has caused them to fall to the sixth spot in the Eastern Conference standings. Meanwhile, Brooklyn has lost nine of its last 11 overall and six straight away from home. The Nets were led by Spencer Dinwiddies 26 points and eight assists. Jarret Allen had 17 points. Thats been the issue for us all year, Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson said. Not being able to score in the fourth quarter efficiently. It follows a trend. We played well for three quarters and had a ton of good looks. We were getting to the rim, but we werent finishing. Neither side was able to gain complete control of the game, with the largest lead being a seven-point Brooklyn advantage late in the first half. Harris, however, gave the Sixers offensive life in the second half. With the score 106-104 with two minutes to play, Harris hit a leaning 3-pointer that rattled in just as the shot clock ran out that proved to be a back-breaker. I think every shot I throw up is going in, Harris said. But when I saw it go in, I was happy. Josh Richardson had 15 points and Furkan Korkmaz added 15 off the bench. Al Horford had 14 points and eight rebounds for the Sixers. The Nets received 15 points from Taurean Price and 14 from Kyrie Irving, who struggled in just his third game back from right shoulder impingement in going 6 of 21 from the floor and recording a minus-29 overall. TIP-INS Sixers: Joel Embiid was on the floor for Philadelphia before the game, shooting shots with his right hand while wearing a big cast on his left hand to protect his torn radial collateral ligament. He's engaged with his team, Sixers head coach Brett Brown said. What that means in relation to his time frame I don't know. But I don't think we're going overboard in relation to doing anything we haven't done in the past. Embiid suffered the injury on Jan. 6 against Oklahoma City. He was originally scheduled to see a specialist in one to two weeks and could miss upwards of six weeks. Nets: Center DeAndre Jordan was declared out at halftime after suffering a dislocated right middle finger late in the first half when he was going up to attempt to block a Ben Simmons layup. Jordan -- who had signed with Brooklyn in the off-season in part to offset the loss of Kevin Durant as the prized free agent rehabilitates from his right Achilles injury -- had scored four points and grabbed three rebounds in 10 minutes. Hes going to be examined (on Thursday), Atkinson said after the game. For the season, Jordan is averaging 8 points and 9.7 rebounds in 37 games.","401161247"
"MIAMI --  Kendrick Nunn was the last Miami player off the court at halftime, required to hang out for an extra minute or two in order to pick up his second Eastern Conference rookie of the month trophy. ""Hopefully, I get some more,"" Nunn said. He's well on his way. Nunn scored 33 points on 13-for-18 shooting, Goran Dragic added 17 points and the Heat held on to beat the San Antonio Spurs 106-100 Wednesday night and move back into the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference. ""He was able to get into a great rhythm,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Nunn, who was 8 for 8 in the first half. Bam Adebayo -- cut from USA Basketball's national team by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich over the summer -- had 14 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for the Heat. Miami improved to 18-1 at home, one win shy of matching last season's home win total. ""Now that you see him during the season, I've shaken my head several times,"" Popovich said of Adebayo, a serious All-Star contender this season. ""That's not the guy that we saw during the tryout. Maybe that was my fault. Maybe I should have done it differently so his skills could come out."" Jimmy Butler scored 12 and Duncan Robinson added 11 for Miami. DeMar DeRozan scored 30 points on 12-of-14 shooting for San Antonio, while Patty Mills added 21 for the Spurs. San Antonio had won three of its last four games, all those wins coming against top Eastern Conference teams Milwaukee, Boston and Toronto. But the Spurs missed 11 of their first 12 shots to start the fourth quarter and lost the lead for good during that drought. ""We're going to be fine,"" DeRozan said. ""It (stinks) right now. It's right there. There's a lot of basketball to be played. We're trending in the right direction. We're playing well against great teams, have beaten some great teams and that does a lot for our confidence and knowing how much time is left."" The Spurs were 10 for 33 from 3-point range, while Miami was 17 for 40. ""It's tough. It's hard to win when we shoot that bad from the 3,"" Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge said. Butler's 3-pointer with 5:24 left capped what was a 20-5 run going back to the third quarter -- and was maybe a most unlikely salvo. Butler hadn't made a 3 since Dec. 20, going 0 for 7 in his last nine games before Wednesday. Consecutive baskets by Nunn pushed the lead to 94-83 with 3:42 left, but the Spurs came right back. Mills made a 3-pointer, DeRozan followed with a three-point play on the next possession and just like that the Heat lead was down to five with 3:04 remaining. Mills had a good look at a 3 that would have put San Antonio within three with 1:16 left, but Butler blocked it and Miami held on from there. TIP-INS Spurs: This is the first season since 1996-97 that San Antonio will have a losing record at the midway mark. The Spurs were 11-30 halfway through that season, which not coincidentally was also the last one in which they missed the playoffs. ... Excluding a preseason game between the clubs this past fall, San Antonio assistant Tim Duncan was part of a Spurs at Heat game for the first time since March 31, 2015. Heat: Tyler Herro (bruised knee) couldn't play, though the Heat expect him back shortly. ... This was Miami's only home game in a 15-day span, sandwiched around last week's three-game road trip and a two-game swing that starts Friday. After that, the Heat have a five-game, nine-day homestand. ... Florida Panthers career scoring leader Jonathan Huberdeau and country star Luke Combs were in the crowd. TWO-WAY WONDERS The Heat converted Chris Silva's two-way contract to a standard one -- guaranteed for next season with a team option for 2021-22. Silva becomes the third player on this Heat roster to start as a two-way signee, the others being Robinson and Derrick Jones Jr. RESPECT There has long been respect between the Heat and Spurs, born in part from their NBA Finals matchups in 2013 and 2014. Popovich has often praised Spoelstra, and did so again Wednesday. ""He has high standards and he makes people accountable. ... That's something that's in the water here,"" Popovich said. Popovich exchanged greetings with Spoelstra and Heat assistant Dan Craig, a former USA Basketball assistant for Popovich, after the game.","401161248"
"CHICAGO --  Zach LaVine wants to play in the All-Star Game next month in Chicago. He is making quite the case. Especially lately. LaVine had 30 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, and the banged-up Bulls beat Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards 115-106 on Wednesday night. ""I've been blessed to coach a lot of All-Stars, and I think he should be in the game,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. Chicago placed seven players in double figures in its second win in its last nine games. Thaddeus Young had 18 points and eight boards, and Tomas Satoransky scored 18 points against his former team. The Bulls outscored the Wizards 60-46 in the second half. ""They were getting in transition, some switches, made some tough shots,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We have to be better."" LaVine went 6 for 11 from 3-point range in his career-best fifth straight game with at least 25 points. It's the longest such streak for the Bulls since Derrick Rose accomplished the feat in six consecutive games in 2010. LaVine's All-Star argument is weighed down by Chicago's 15-27 record, but he is averaging a career-best 24.6 points in his sixth NBA season. ""It would mean a lot. It's one of my goals,"" LaVine said of the All-Star Game. ""I think it would be great for the city, having one of (its) guys there. I don't feel like I need the verification of it. I think I know where I am as a player and how I've been playing."" Beal scored 23 points on 8-for-13 shooting after he was listed as questionable because of right shoulder soreness. The high-scoring star also has been hampered lately by soreness in his lower right leg. Jordan McRae had 16 points for Washington, which has dropped three of four. Isaiah Thomas and Davis Bertans scored 12 points apiece. ""We just have to figure out how to get it done, honestly,"" Beal said. ""I really don't know, you just have to get it done."" The Bulls grabbed control with a 10-0 run in the fourth quarter. LaVine made a 3-pointer to make it 106-95 with 4:56 left. Chicago held on down the stretch despite playing short-handed after Daniel Gafford and Chandler Hutchison left with injuries. Gafford dislocated his right thumb on a steal in the first quarter. The 6-foot-11 Gafford called timeout after picking off a pass by Ian Mahinmi, and then jogged off the court in the direction of the Bulls' locker room. X-rays were negative, and the team said he is expected to miss two to four weeks. ""I thought it was just like a slight jam of my thumb and I looked at my thumb and it was way more than a jam,"" a chuckling Gafford said. Hutchison re-injured his right shoulder when he was fouled on a dunk in the fourth, leading to a hard fall. The 23-year-old Hutchison, who had 11 points on 5-for-7 shooting, just returned last week from a right shoulder sprain. ""Chandler is going to be re-evaluated tomorrow,"" Boylen said. ""Same shoulder that's been bothering him, so we'll see where that goes."" QUITE UNUSUAL The teams played the second half with red streamers hanging from the overhead scoreboard, remnants of a Disney-themed halftime show. One of the streamers fell down during a timeout with 8:53 left in the third quarter, and two workers scurried out to pick it up before play resumed. TIP-INS Wizards: Rookie F Rui Hachimura traveled with the team to Chicago, but remains out with a groin injury. He hasn't played since Dec. 16. ""He's doing well,"" Brooks said. ""Shot around a little bit, very, very light shooting yesterday. ... Hopefully we can get him on the court more each day."" ... C Thomas Bryant played about 12 minutes in his second game back after missing 20 games with a foot injury. The 6-foot-10 Bryant is on a minutes restriction. ""He's missed a lot of time,"" Brooks said. ""Throwing him back into the fire in the NBA competitiveness. We'll take our time still."" Bulls: F Otto Porter Jr. missed his 33rd consecutive game with a broken left foot. Boylen said he had no update on his status. ""He's very frustrated,"" Boylen said. ""I just try to keep him up and be positive and you know we'll take you back when you come back."" Boylen said there has been no talk of shutting Porter down for the season.","401161249"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The bags of ice on his legs after the game were a reminder that Pacers big man Domantas Sabonis has been playing through left knee soreness as the season nears the midway point. Watching his performance Wednesday night against Minnesota, it might have been easy to forget that Sabonis is ailing at all. Sabonis matched a season high with 29 points and added 13 rebounds and six assists to lead Indiana over the Timberwolves 104-99 on Wednesday night. ""He did a good job of attacking, and we did a good job of getting him the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Malcolm Brogdon added 21 points in his second game back from injury and Doug McDermott scored 14 off the bench for the Pacers, who have won three straight games. Jarrett Culver led Minnesota with 17 points and Gorgui Dieng had 15 points and 11 boards. The Timberwolves have lost three in a row. Sabonis looked poised for a big night offensively after scoring 25 points in the first half. Minnesota let Sabonis get open down low too often, a big reason for Indiana's 30 points in the paint before halftime. ""I was just trying to be aggressive,"" Sabonis said. ""T.J. (McConnell), Malcolm, everybody was doing a great job of finding me. I got some easy offensive rebounds."" Sabonis was quiet in the second half, though, making just one basket in each of the final two quarters. The fourth-year big man didn't score in the second half until less than a minute remained in the third. Brogdon picked up the scoring burden for much of the half. He had 16 of his 21 points after halftime, including 10 in the fourth quarter. ""We didn't have the same intensity as we did in the first half,"" said Timberwolves forward Robert Covington. ""They kind of switched roles a little bit. They came out with the energy we were supposed to come out with."" Minnesota big man Karl-Anthony Towns missed his 15th straight game with a left knee sprain. A combination of several players matched up on Sabonis struggled early to keep him in check in Towns' absence. ""Everybody's got strengths and weaknesses,"" Dieng said. ""Nights like that, you've got to put your best defender on him."" Minnesota led by nine in the first half after a basket by Andrew Wiggins. The Timberwolves took a 59-54 lead into halftime but saw that lead momentarily disappear in the third before holding a one-point lead after three. Culver trimmed Indiana's lead on consecutive possessions late in the fourth, but the Pacers had an answer each time. After a basket by Culver made it a three-point game, Brogdon hit his first 3-pointer of the game to push the lead to six. Wiggins was held scoreless in the second half on 0-of-5 shooting for Minnesota after 10 first-half points. The teams play each other again in two days. Both coaches likened the situation to preparing for a playoff series. It's the second time this season the Timberwolves have faced the same team in consecutive games. They also did so in November when they played at Utah before hosting the Jazz two days later. TIP-INS Pacers: It was the fifth time in his career Sabonis had 25 or more points and 10 or more rebounds in a game. . McDermott scored 10 of his 14 points in the final quarter. Timberwolves: Minnesota's bench outscored Indiana's reserves 39-26, led by 15 points from Keita Bates-Diop. . Covington led Minnesota with 11 first-half points but didn't make a basket in the second half until a 3-pointer with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. . Dieng's double-double was his sixth of the season. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE McMillan successfully challenged an offensive foul called against Sabonis with 7:51 to play in the second quarter. After a replay review, the foul on Sabonis was overturned. It would have been Sabonis' third of the game. Instead, he finished the half with just two fouls and scored four more points in the quarter after the call was overturned. ""I thought that was big. I'm glad we won that,"" McMillan said. ""He was playing so well. We needed to try to keep him out on the floor.""","401161250"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Norman Powell doesn't need to work his way back into form. The Toronto guard missed 11 games with a left shoulder injury before returning to action this week. In his second game back, he scored 23 points, and the Raptors held off a furious rally to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 130-121 on Wednesday night. Powell scored 20 points on Sunday against the San Antonio Spurs in his first game back, then followed up with another strong performance. He made 9 of 11 shots, including 3 of 4 3-pointers. ""I've just tried to come back and assert myself and be aggressive in the flow of the offense and play my game and continue to take what the defense is giving me,"" Powell said. Pascal Siakam and O.G. Anunoby each added 21 points for the Raptors, who shot a season-high 61.2% from the field. Dennis Schroder scored 25 points, Danilo Gallinari scored 23 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexader added 21 for the Thunder, who cut a 30-point deficit to three before Toronto held on. ""Just calmed down a little bit,"" Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. ""Just got a little bit more patient. Got the ball in the guy's hands that we need to have the ball in. That's what we need to do. We find a way, but we can't put ourselves in those positions all the time."" Toronto led 73-43 in the second quarter before the Thunder closed the first half on a 12-0 run.

The Raptors led 97-83 heading into the fourth, and had a 21-point lead with 6:39 to play. Oklahoma City made a huge comeback try late. Gallinari threw down a monster dunk and was fouled with 2:39 to play. The free throw cut Toronto's lead to three, but Toronto closed the game on an 8-2 run. The Raptors remained composed during Oklahoma City's run. ""You don't want to go outside yourself,"" Powell said. ""When they go on a run like that, you just try to get everybody on the same page."" The Thunder have made several big rallies this season, but like Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers, a large deficit was too much to overcome. ""I think to start the game, we don't bring it every game,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""When we do bring it, we're tough to beat and can play with anybody.

Rookie reserve Michael Porter Jr. scored 19 points, Dozier had a big second half filling in for injured point guard Jamal Murray and the Nuggets beat the Charlotte Hornets 100-86 on Wednesday night. I've been preparing for this my whole life, Dozier said. I've been excited to have this opportunity. I hate that it had to happen under these circumstances. But (Murray) will be all right. I've just been trying to stay ready for this. Murray exited the game with 1:32 remaining in the second quarter after rolling his left ankle. He was helped off the floor by teammates. The banged-up Nuggets were already without Gary Harris (groin) and Paul Millsap (bruised left knee). Enter Dozier, who finished with 12 points in 13 minutes. He had a stretch in the second half where he scored nine straight for the Nuggets. Dozier was recalled from Windy City of the G League on Tuesday to provide depth. Dozier averaged 20.9 points and 7.7 assists in 16 games for the Bulls. He's been called up before, but never appeared in a game for Denver. Following the game, he didn't check his phone immediately. But he knew who one of the first missed calls would be from -- his mom. Sure enough, there it was. Before the contest was even over, Murray posted on his Twitter account about Dozier: All Im sayin is yall better be ready to see my boy Dozier-Kid shine. ... dat boy can hoop!! No doubt. After his college days at South Carolina, Dozier wasn't picked in the 2017 NBA draft. He appeared in eight games between Oklahoma City (two, 2017-18) and Boston (six, '18-19) before signing a two-way contract with Denver for this season. I was super-happy for P.J., Porter said. He's stayed so patient. Porter carried the Nuggets for a stretch as he erupted for 11 of his points in the second quarter. He keeps taking his game to higher and higher levels. Coach Michael Malone's trust level in him is soaring, too. I like whenever they run plays for me, cracked Porter, who also had eight rebounds. I'm trying to make plays for my teammates. I have to keep that going. Terry Rozier scored 20 points for the Hornets, who wrapped up a winless four-game trip. It was a tough road trip for us, some tough games,"" said Cody Zeller, who had 11 points. I thought we played well in spurts. Denver led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter before the Hornets closed on a 21-6 run. Bolstered by Dozier, the Nuggets steadily built the lead back up to a comfortable margin. They're talented, they're deep, they're young and they play the right way,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. They're a fantastic team. The Nuggets were rightfully fearful of a Hornets team that's 15-29. Denver has struggled against teams under .500 all season. We're not looking at records, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We have to go out and play our game. Murray was hurt when he tried to contest a 3-point shot by Rozier and appeared to land on Rozier's foot. Murray instantly grabbed at his ankle as play was stopped. Murray had five points and one assist before exiting. He was also dealing with a sore back. Dozier's ready if needed. Just do as I do every day, he said. I prepare for every game like I'm going to play. TIP-INS Hornets: Borrego picked up a technical foul late in the first quarter. Rozier and Miles Bridges were given technicals on the same play with 5:43 remaining. ... Devonte' Graham, Bridges and P.J. Washington all scored 14 points. Nuggets: Denver is 11-1 this season when holding teams under 100 points. ... Nikola Jokic had 12 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ... Mason Plumlee had 15 points. FAMILY MATTERS It was a family reunion for brothers Willy and Juancho Hernangomez. Juancho scored no points in 17:50 for Denver, while his older brother had five points in 11:08 minutes for Charlotte. CONSULTANT FOR SERBIA? Malone denied a report that he's agreed to become a consultant for the Serbian national team. ""That's not accurate,"" Malone said before the game.","401161252"
"HOUSTON --  After getting off to a disappointing start this season, the Portland Trail Blazers are focused on playing much better going forward. On Wednesday night against the Houston Rockets they did that, limiting James Harden to his fewest points of the season in a 117-107 win. A season is full of ups and downs and we've had more downs this year than ups, but it's a whole second half of the season to play, Damian Lillard said. We executed and we played like we wanted to win the game ... we've just got to try to sustain that. Lillard scored 25 points and CJ McCollum added 24 as the Trail Blazers withstood a late surge from the Rockets to get their second straight victory. The Trail Blazers led by double figures for most of the game, but the Rockets began cutting into the lead in the fourth. A 3 by Ben McLemore got them within five with about five minutes to go. But McCollum and Carmelo Anthony then made consecutive 3-pointers for Portland to make it 111-100 with four minutes left, and Houston didn't threaten again. When Hassan Whiteside made four points in a row, capped by a dunk, later in the fourth to make it 115-102, the home fans began streaming for the exits. Russell Westbrook had a triple-double with 31 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds on a night when Harden scored 13 points. It was the fewest points Harden had scored since he had 10 against Minnesota on Jan. 18, 2018. Lillard was proud of the work they did against Harden, who entered the game averaging an NBA-best 37.8 points a game. We gave him a lot of attention and pretty much just made him give the ball up to other guys and decided were going to live with somebody else beating us,"" Lillard said. And it turned out to be a pretty good game plan."" Houston lost consecutive games for the first time since a season-high three-game skid from Nov. 20-24, and has dropped three of its last four. Everyone goes through the tough times throughout the course of the year, Harden said. For us, this is now. Weve got to come together and figure out what the problem is and go out there and try to fight through it."" The Rockets had a tough shooting night after losing to Memphis 121-110 on the road Tuesday night and shot just 39.6%. Harden shot 3 of 12 and center Clint Capela was just 7 of 14. Houston scored the first five points of the fourth quarter, but Portland got 3s from Gary Trent, Jr. and Anthony Tolliver to make it 96-82. McCollum made all of Portland's points in a 6-3 spurt later in the fourth to leave the Trail Blazers up 102-88. Westbrook was at the free throw line soon after that, and he and Lillard both received technical fouls for jawing at each other. Houston finally found some rhythm on offense after that and used a 9-1 run, with 3s from P.J. Tucker and McLemore to cut the deficit to 103-97 midway through the quarter. It was a nine-point game when the Rockets' Danuel House made a layup midway through the third quarter, but Portland scored the next seven points, including a 3 from Kent Bazemore, to extend it to 81-65 two minutes later. Eric Gordon made two 3-pointers after that to power a 6-3 run that got Houston within 84-71. Houston made six straight points later in the third, but Lillard added a layup for Portland to wrap up the quarter and leave the Trail Blazers up by 13 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Whiteside had 18 points and 17 rebounds. ... All five players in Portland's starting lineup scored at least 10 points. ... Portland made 11 of 36 3-pointers. Rockets: Westbrook has scored 20 or more points in 15 straight games. ... Gordon scored 20 points with six 3s and has made at least four 3-pointers in three games in a row. ... Harden had eight rebounds and seven assists. MELO RETURNS TO HOUSTON Anthony added 18 points with 12 rebounds for Portland in his first game against Houston since the Rockets parted ways with him after just 10 games last season. After he left Houston, Anthony didn't find another job until the Trail Blazers signed him in November. But he insisted he didn't have any added emotions in his return to Houston, saying he'd already dealt with his feelings about what happened here. I kind of got past all of that, the time that I was off,"" he said. The time that I did have to kind of think about that situation, and Ive done dealt with every emotion that you could think about. Trying to figure out why. Questioning myself at the beginning. Working so hard to get past that and kind of be at peace with that.""","401161253"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  On a night when Luka Doncic set a career high for assists, one of his early passes wound up in the stands. All he could do was watch it and chuckle as he ran back down the court. It was a bad pass, Doncic said of his cross-court throw. I was laughing. He was open. I should have hit him. That was a very bad pass. Doncic had 25 points, 15 rebounds and 17 assists for his NBA-leading 12th triple-double, and the Mavericks held off a late run to beat the Sacramento Kings 127-123 on Wednesday. Seth Curry scored 21 points off the bench as Dallas won its third straight despite the absence of Kristaps Porzingis, who missed his ninth consecutive game. Dwight Powell added 17 points and nine rebounds, and Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 18. This has been a hard team for us to play, difficult matchups, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Our starters, our bench, everybody contributed in a big way. Playing the second half of a back-to-back following a 27-point win over Golden State, the Mavericks scored 71 points in the first half and handed the Kings their third straight loss. Doncic sparked Dallas with a big third quarter when he had 11 points and six rebounds. He also made a cross-court pass similar to the one he airmailed earlier in the game. That helped the Mavs stretch a four-point lead to 108-93. Doncic finished with his 20th career triple-double despite going 0 for 5 from beyond the arc. Obviously, not as good as I can play. I have to practice those 3s, Doncic said. They were doubling me every time, and I like it. Basketball is five players so somebodys going to be open if they double me. Doncic joined Jason Kidd as the only Dallas players to have at least 25 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in one game. These numbers are just crazy, Carlisle said as he looked at the stat sheet. Its hard to fathom. Theyre trapping him all over the court every time down. Hes both beating the traps and playing beautifully out of the traps. DeAaron Fox had 27 points and 12 assists for Sacramento. Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield scored 25 apiece. Sacramento beat Dallas 110-106 in December without Fox or Marvin Bagley III. Both were in the lineup this time, but the outcome was vastly different. We got stops but we let them come up with the 50-50 ball, Kings coach Luke Walton said. It should be pretty clear until we can get out there and play that hard, at that pace and still keep a defensive mindset, there's going to be a lot of ups and downs. The Kings trailed by 16 early in the fourth but made a big run to get to 126-123 following a 3-pointer by Barnes. Curry, who moments earlier missed one of two free throws, made one of two again. Fox then missed a 3 to end the game. Doncic nearly had a double-double before halftime but it was Curry who gave Dallas its biggest lift in the first half. Curry made four 3s, three on wide-open looks, and scored 16 points in 14 minutes to help the Mavs to a 71-67 lead. PORZINGIS PROGRESSING Porzingis didnt sound too frustrated after being a late scratch from the lineup. He felt some pain in his right knee during pregame warmups. I worked out yesterday, not a full workout but a solid workout, 35-45 minutes. Felt good, Porzingis said. Then today I kind of felt it a little bit more. Started warming up, started doing some stuff and felt it more and more. They made the decision for me to take some more time. The Mavericks have a day off before playing Portland, and Carlisle said the team will assess Porzingis situation then. TIP-INS Mavericks: Former Kings player Justin Jackson made a buzzer-beating 3 to end the third quarter.  Over his last three games, Powell is shooting 83.3% (25 of 30). Kings: Fox was whistled for a technical after being hit with an offensive foul in the third quarter.  Bagley started at center for the first time this season. Part of that is a result of Richaun Holmes being out with a right shoulder injury. Holmes missed his fourth straight game and will be re-evaluated in two to three weeks. Bagley had 12 points and seven rebounds.  Bogdan Bogdanovic (right ankle soreness) did not play.","401161254"
"LOS ANGELES --  Markelle Fultz faked LeBron James off his hip, weaved through traffic in the waning seconds and scored the final bucket of his phenomenal triple-double performance. Fultz then dropped to the court with a cramp. The Orlando Magic rushed to their valuable teammate's aid, with Nikola Vucevic swiftly stretching out Fultz's foot to make sure he could finish. ""It was the biggest play of the game!"" Vucevic said with a laugh. Fultz had several bigger ones, and so did a half-dozen contributors to what was likely the Magic's best win of the season. Fultz hit two big layups in the final minute while scoring 21 points during his second career triple-double, and Orlando snapped the Los Angeles Lakers' nine-game winning streak with a 119-118 victory Wednesday night. Fultz added 11 rebounds and 10 assists, while Aaron Gordon had 21 points and a late go-ahead basket as the Magic became the first sub-.500 team to beat the Western Conference-leading Lakers this season despite blowing a 21-point lead in the second half. James had 19 points and matched his career high with 19 assists, but he also missed a tying 3-pointer with 3 seconds left. The Lakers showed off their impressive depth in the absence of Anthony Davis, but they couldn't overcome the Magic's superb contributions from up and down the roster. ""I think it just shows how deep this team goes, how much we believe in each other and what we're capable of,"" Fultz said. ""We have guys out, but our mindset was the same going into the game. We all believed we had a chance to win this game, and we relied on each other."" The Magic played without injured regulars Evan Fournier, Michael Carter-Williams and D.J. Augustin in their third stop on a six-game road trip, but they've rarely looked better. Wes Iwundu scored a career-high 19 points while starting in Fournier's place, and Vucevic scored seven of his 19 points in the fourth quarter of the Magic's eighth win in 12 games. Fultz said the final minutes were ""what I've dreamed of,"" and the Magic were thrilled to see it come true for the up-and-down former No. 1 overall pick. ""Boy is nice, and he's only going to get better,"" Gordon said. ""He did a great job just running the show, settling them down, getting good shots. And then down the stretch, he took over."" Quinn Cook hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to finish with a season-high 22 points, but the Lakers (33-8) hit the halfway point of their regular season with their first loss since Christmas. Troy Daniels added a season-high 17 points, but the Lakers finally failed to overcome the absence of Davis, who missed his fourth straight game with a bruised backside. ""We've just got to be better,"" James said. ""We didn't start the game out the right way, but I'm not disappointed in anybody or anything that we did. Our bench was the reason there was a game at the end, but they came in and produced everything we needed."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also scored 17 points for the Lakers in their final home game before a five-game road trip while the Grammy Awards take over Staples Center. The Lakers erased an 87-66 deficit early in the fourth quarter with an impressive rally, but the Magic answered and traded big scores down the stretch. Gordon's basket with 2:03 left reclaimed the lead for Orlando. Cook and James hit late 3-pointers that trimmed the Magic's lead to one point, but Fultz drove for a clutch layup with 15 seconds left to put Orlando up 118-115, and James' tying attempt didn't go down. ""We wanted to finish this homestand out the right way, but those guys made plays,"" Cook said. ""Being the Lakers, we get everybody's best shot. Markelle made two tough, tough plays at the end."" Cook and Fultz both graduated from the famed DeMatha Catholic High School in Maryland. Cook referred to Fultz as his ""little brother."" TIP-INS Magic: Fournier's unavailability was determined shortly before game time. ... Augustin sat out for the second time in three games with a bruised left knee. ... Carter-Williams has missed 12 straight games with a sprained left shoulder. Lakers: G Rajon Rondo missed his second straight game with a broken right ring finger. ... Frank Vogel coached the Magic for two seasons from 2016-18. His first team in Los Angeles has already won more games than the Magic won in either of his two seasons there. ... Dwight Howard had nine points and 16 rebounds. WILD SWINGS Orlando jumped to a 20-point lead in the second quarter. The Magic had seven players with at least seven points in their exuberant first half. The Lakers trimmed their deficit to seven points at halftime, but then gave up a 21-4 run by the Magic. The Lakers responded with a 28-6 rally, but couldn't finish. CARUSO INJURED Alex Caruso went to the locker room after he got accidentally smacked in the face while stealing the ball from Mo Bamba in the second quarter. A concussion evaluation was inconclusive, and the valuable backup guard didn't return. He will be re-evaluated Thursday. BIG GAME Iwundu was outstanding for Orlando while starting in place of Fournier, who sat out with a bruised right quadriceps. The speedy guard surpassed his previous career high early in the third quarter.","401161255"
"NEW YORK --  Deandre Ayton and the Phoenix Suns are picking up some momentum halfway through the season. Ayton had 26 points and a career-high 21 rebounds, and the Suns pounded the New York Knicks 121-98 on Thursday night. ""We are only out there for one another,"" Ayton said. ""Without team success, you are not going to reach your individual accolades. That is big on this team and we feed off each other."" New York lost for the seventh time in eight games, and rookie guard RJ Barrett departed in the third quarter with an ankle injury. Barrett, the third overall pick in last year's draft, was using crutches after the game. ""It hurts. I never really been hurt before,"" Barrett said. ""I don't remember the last time I missed a game. But, we play so many games it was bound to happen."" Phoenix shot 51% (47 for 92) from the field and placed five players in double figures in its third win in four games. Devin Booker scored 29 points, and Ricky Rubio had 25 points and 13 assists. At 17-24, the Suns are off to their best 41-game start since going 23-18 in 2014-15. After 41 games last year, the Suns were 9-32. ""Everybody wants to see each other's success,"" Booker said. ""We are working every day. We are not getting complacent. After a win, we are not satisfied. We have goals in-house that we keep as a team that we want to reach."" Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft, was 11 for 15 from the field in his 11th game this season. The 6-foot-11 center played on opening night, and then served a 25-game suspension for violating the league's anti-drug program after testing positive for a diuretic. He sprained an ankle in his return to the lineup Dec. 17. Julius Randle led the Knicks with 26 points. Marcus Morris Sr., who returned to the starting lineup after missing five games with a sore neck, had 17 points, and Mitchell Robinson finished with 12. New York opened a 35-27 lead on Bobby Portis' 3-pointer with 11:20 left in the first half. But Phoenix ripped off 28 of the next 37 points to go in front for good. The Knicks pulled within four on Morris' jumper early in the third before the Suns pulled away again. Dario Saric's layup made it 79-66 with 6:40 left in the quarter. ""We were behind plays all night,"" Knicks coach Mike Miller said. ""We allowed a good team to take basically advantage of what they wanted to do. We didn't take anything away."" Saric scored 11 points for Phoenix, which led by as many as 29 in the final quarter. ""This is the team we want to be,"" coach Monty Williams said. ""Holding a team under 100 points is really hard and 31 assists is phenomenal. It's a really good win for us. All of them are, but that's a big-time win because of the way we did it."" TIP-INS Suns: Kelly Oubre Jr. is in concussion protocol and missed his first game of the season. Only Saric and Mikal Bridges have played in all 41 games for Phoenix. ... Rubio returned to the starting lineup after missing Tuesday's game at Atlanta for personal reasons. Knicks: Portis is the only Knick to play in every game this season. ...

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 17 rebounds, Khris Middleton scored 23 and the Milwaukee Bucks held off the Boston Celtics 128-123 on Thursday night. With the victory, the NBA-leading Bucks (37-6) extended their winning streak to five games. Kemba Walker scored a game-high 40 points to lead the Celtics, who took the floor without Jaylen Brown. The 6-foot-6 forward suffered a sprained right thumb in a 13-point loss to Detroit on Wednesday. ""We saw a play late in the first half and we think that might have been when it happened,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""Maybe it got worse as the game went on. He didn't say much about it at halftime. Certainly, after the game it was sore. Today, more sore."" Stevens said they will do more tests on Brown's thumb on Friday. Marcus Smart, who started in place of Brown, had 24 points. Antetokounmpo, who also had seven assists, had his 35th double-double of the season. After trailing by as many as 27, the Celtics outscored Milwaukee 36-22 to pull within 127-123 with 38 seconds to play. But Smart missed a 3-pointer and Middleton knocked down one of two free throws to seal the victory. Antetokounmpo scored the first basket of the night and the Bucks never trailed. Milwaukee hit seven of their first 10 shots, including their first four attempts from 3, and led 36-20 after the first quarter. Brook Lopez had three of those 3-pointers and had 11 points in the opening quarter. Lopez finished with 16 points. Milwaukee set a new season-high with 76 points in the first half. The Bucks had a 76-58 lead at the break. Boston stormed out in the second half, cutting Milwaukee's lead to 87-81 with 5:16 left in the third. But the Bucks ended the quarter on a 19-6 run. Gordon Hayward, who finished with seven points on 1-of-10 shooting for the Celtics, scored his only field goal on a 3 at the end of the third.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Brandon Ingram scored a career-high 49 points, and the New Orleans Pelicans stopped the Utah Jazz's 10-game win streak with a 138-132 victory Thursday night. Utah led 132-127 on Bojan Bogdanovic's 3 with 2:28 to go in overtime, but went scoreless the rest of the way. The Pelicans scored 11 straight on layups by Derrick Favors and E'Twaun Moore and seven free throws. Favors finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks against his former team. Moore had 16 points for New Orleans, which has won 10 of 14 and has two games to play before the NBA's top overall draft choice, Zion Williamson, is slated to make his Pelicans debut on Wednesday night. Fellow 2019 first-round picks Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Jaxson Hayes each played prominent roles in New Orleans' victory. Alexander-Walker had 12 points, and Hayes collected nine points, five rebounds and a blocked shot. The Pelicans thought they had won the game in regulation on Ingram's off-balance jumper with .2 seconds left. But Hayes was called for holding Rudy Gobert as Utah attempted a desperation tip-in on the inbound pass. The call, which was upheld after video review, gave Gobert a chance to win it by making both foul shots. But with the crowd heartily booing the officials, Gobert missed the first free throw before hitting the pressure-packed second to tie it at 122 and force overtime. Utah star Donovan Mitchell tied his career high with 46 points before missing several shots in the final minutes of overtime. Bogdanovic scored 26, and Gobert finished with 17 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks. Mitchell hit three 3s in the last four minutes of regulation to put Utah on the brink of victory, but missed a mid-range pull-up inside the final 10 seconds. The Pelicans rebounded and called timeout with 6.3 seconds left to set up the tense final sequence of regulation. The game was tight throughout. There were 23 lead changes and 23 ties. The largest lead by either team was nine after Favors' block of Gobert led to a transition layup by Ingram to make it 56-47. Mitchell cut it to 56-49 at halftime when he took a pass from Joe Ingles and in one motion flipped a running floater off the glass as time expired.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon just wanted one more chance to make things right. When the opportunity came, Brogdon delivered. He drove toward the basket, flicked the ball on the run and made a tiebreaking 16-footer with 18 seconds left to give the Pacers a 116-114 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. ""Being the closer, sometimes it's about making the last shot but sometimes it's about making the right play, making the right pass,"" Brogdon said. ""My teammates, this organization, my coach trust me with the ball and I'm going to continue to try and make good decisions."" He was spot on in the Pacers' fourth straight win. It didn't come easily, nor did it follow coach Nate McMillan's preferred script. But the Pacers demonstrated something else Friday -- the toughness needed to overcome foul trouble, defensive struggles and a late scoring drought that nearly cost them after taking a 114-107 lead with 3:28 left. That was followed by missed shots, three fouls and two turnovers, which the Timberwolves used to forge a tie with 1:48 to play and even led to three chances for Minnesota to take the lead. Instead, Brogdon bailed the Pacers out with the final basket. He finished with 12 points and 10 assists. ""Once we're under a minute, normally we're involving Malcolm and Domantas (Sabonis) in some type of two-man game because those two have been the guys who have done good things for us all season,"" McMillan said. ""We're going to put the ball in his (Brogdon's) hands and let him make decisions for us."" T.J. Warren scored 28 points to help the Pacers fend off Minnesota for the second time in three nights, giving them their first season sweep of the series in four years. Two-time All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns returned to the Timberwolves lineup after missing the previous 15 games with a sprained left knee. He had 27 points in 28 minutes and made the two free throws to tie the score at 114. But he was just 4 of 12 from the field in the second half, missed all three of his fourth-quarter attempts and stepped out of bounds with 1:16 to play -- wiping out what would have been the go-ahead 3-pointer. Towns' late turnover initiated a sequence of errors. With the score still tied, Andrew Wiggins missed a layup on a fast break with 55 seconds left and then stepped out of bounds for another turnover with 31 seconds to go. The second miscue led to Brogdon's basket, and then Shabazz Napier came up short on a 3-pointer with 8 seconds left. Wiggins scored 22 points in Minnesota's fourth consecutive loss. ""What I thought were good rhythm 3s, they usually make,"" coach Ryan Saunders said, inferring things might could have been different if they went down. ""You know, we might be having a different conversation right now."" HE'S BACK Saunders said before the game that he would play it safe with Towns, who hadn't played since Dec. 13. He said the Timberwolves would limit Towns' minutes and closely monitor his fatigue level. How long that lasts may depend on how Towns responds to live game action over the next couple of games. But the Timberwolves sure appreciated having him back on the court. ""Having him out, we had to get through it,"" Wiggins said. ""I'm glad to have him back and I'm not surprised he played so well. That's what he does. He's a natural born hooper."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Josh Okogie had 15 points while Napier and Jarrett Culver each scored 12. Napier had nine assists. ...

"PHILADELPHIA --  Furkan Korkmaz asked the Philadelphia 76ers 14 months ago to trade him somewhere he could play amid frequent shuttles back and forth to the clubs G-League team in Delaware. On Friday night, he was a lifeline for a team that may have found an answer to its desperate need for outside shooting. Korkmaz had six 3-pointers and a career-high 24 points, and the 76ers beat the Chicago Bulls 100-89 Friday night. Everyone could see that I was really feeling it and trying to find me, Korkmaz said. As a team, we had good open looks in moving the ball and we executed the game plan well. Ben Simmons and Al Horford each scored 20 points for Philadelphia. Simmons had 11 rebounds and seven assists. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 23 points, while Cody White had 14 and Luke Kornet added 13. The Bulls struggled to hold onto the ball, turning the ball over 11 times in the second half as the game slipped away. I didnt like our discipline in the second half offensively, Chicago head coach Jim Boylen said. There were too many turnovers. We had some opportunities and good looks in situations that we could capitalize with. We didnt get it done. Korkmaz helped the 76ers take over in the third quarter after trailing 48-47 coming into the second half. He hit all four of his shots from deep in the quarter, allowing Philadelphia to surge ahead 81-71 at the end of the period. Philadelphia has been linked to virtually every available 3-point shooting trade target to fill the gap left when leading outside shooter JJ Redick left for New Orleans in free agency last year. On Friday, the 76ers were seeing if Korkmaz could give them that lift off the bench. Korkmaz finished 6 of 9 from 3-point range and was 8 of 11 overall. We were dusting off some of the plays that we used to run for JJ, Sixers coach Brett Brown said. We ran five plays in a row to him. And he changed the game and gave us a spark. Its all about reps in practice because JJ was making shots look easy, Korkmaz said. At the end of the day, were running those for me. And when I play with Ben, I feel confident because I know I will be open at the end of the set. Early in the fourth, Korkmaz brought a big ovation from the sold-out crowd with an isolation drive and windmill dunk over Bulls forward Cristiano Felicio. Korkmazs previous high was 21 points at Detroit on Dec. 21. JJ never did that, Brown joked. Simmons had his third straight game with at least 20 points amid the absence of injured Joel Embiid. Tobias Harris added 13 points for Philadelphia, which improved to 20-2 at home. The Sixers are 7-14 on the road and have lost six straight as they leave Philadelphia for three straight games, starting Saturday night in New York. If I knew why, we would have fixed it, Simmons said. We just have to keep working at it. TIP-INS Sixers: The club was hit with a technical foul for having six men on the court toward the end of the first quarter on a play that wiped out another Korkmaz 3-pointer. We were trying different rotations out tonight and Tobias (Harris) was still on the court, Brown said. Ill take responsibility for that. Bulls: Because of weather concerns in Chicago on Friday night, the Bulls were forced to spend an extra night in Philadelphia. They are scheduled to fly Saturday morning into the Midwest to play Saturday nights game against Cleveland. The Cavaliers were also unable to reach Chicago on Friday night after the game. GOOD USE Embiids injured left finger has had a ripple effect on Philadelphias plans in a lot of areas. One of the biggest could be the usage of 12-year veteran and 33-year-old Al Horford, who has seen his minutes go up from his time last year in Boston (31 per game this season as opposed to 29 with the Celtics) and up to 33.5 per game in the five games since Embiid was injured. It was believed the 76ers were going to ease Horfords regular season workload with an eye towards the playoffs. If you look at it, he may go up a little bit, but its never a reckless amount, Philadelphia head coach Brett Brown said before Fridays game. In regard to cutting our nose off to spite our face, that wont happen. Were very mindful of it.","401161262"
"TORONTO --  Feeling fresh after a lengthy injury layoff, Marc Gasol helped the Toronto Raptors pile up the points Friday night. Gasol scored a season-high 20 and matched his career high with six 3-pointers, Norman Powell added 28 and the Raptors beat the Washington Wizards 140-111, matching the franchise record for points in a game. The Raptors also scored 140 points in a double-overtime win at Washington on Jan. 13, 2019. This was the most points they've ever scored in regulation. Gasol shot 6 for 7 from 3-point range as the Raptors set a franchise record by making 22 treys. It was the third time Gasol has made six 3-pointers in a game. Powell added four from long range. ""We're trusting one another, we're moving the ball,"" Powell said. ""We're letting the offense work for us."" Toronto made 22 of 43 attempts from beyond the arc. Gasol played his second game after missing the previous 12 because of a strained left hamstring. Powell scored 20 or more for the third straight game after sitting out 11 games because of a left shoulder injury. Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Gasol and Powell are ""fresh as daisies"" after their absences. ""Marc played for 19 straight months,"" Nurse said of Gasol, who followed up the NBA Finals by leading Spain to a World Cup title in China last summer. ""He finally had a month off, so he's got a little bounce back."" While he appreciated the break, Gasol didn't find it easy to watch from the bench while he was hurt. ""Sitting for a few weeks kind of makes you itch a little bit and makes you want to really play and get back and help your team win,"" he said. Terence Davis II matched his career best with 23 points, OG Anunoby had 18 and Serge Ibaka 15 for the Raptors, whose previous high this season was 133 points in a home win over Cleveland on Dec. 16. Pascal Siakam scored 12 points and Kyle Lowry had 11 as the Raptors won their seventh consecutive game against the Wizards, and fifth straight at home. Toronto has won 17 of its past 20 regular season meetings with Washington. The Raptors, who won at Oklahoma City on Wednesday, posted back-to-back victories for the first time since Dec. 22, when they capped a five-game winning streak by beating Dallas. Toronto has gone 6-6 since that win. Raptors guard Fred VanVleet sat for the fifth straight game because of a strained right hamstring, but is expected to return when Toronto visits Minnesota on Saturday night. Washington made a season-worst 28 turnovers, leading to 30 points for the Raptors. ""We didn't play well, we turned the ball over,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We played against a championship team that was clicking on all cylinders."" Troy Brown Jr. scored 22 points, Isaac Bonga had a career-high 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Bradley Beal scored 14 points as the Wizards lost their third straight and fourth in five. Beal expressed his frustration after the Wizards lost at Chicago on Wednesday, but didn't want to expand on those comments after another disappointing performance. ""At the end of the day, all we've got to do is try to win,"" Beal said. ""That's all I care about."" Wizards guard Jordan McRae injured his left ankle while going after a loose ball early in the second quarter and had to be carried off the court, unable to put weight on his left leg. McRae did not return. He was wearing a walking boot on his left leg after the game. TIP-INS Wizards: Brooks said rookie F Rui Hachimura might not return until February. Hachimura hasn't played since Dec. 16 because of a groin injury. . The Wizards made 23 turnovers in a Jan. 8 loss at Orlando. . Washington is 5-17 on the road. Raptors: Lowry has five or more assists in all 30 games he's played this season. . Toronto outscored Washington 34-19 in fast break points, and 58-40 on points in the paint. AT THE HALF Toronto (27-14) and Washington (13-28) are both at the midpoint of the regular season following Friday's game. The Raptors have been above .500 at the halfway mark in each of the past seven seasons. STEAL AWAY The Raptors matched their season high with 16 steals.","401161263"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies kept the NBAs longest winning streak alive with a fourth-quarter burst and defensive stops in the final seconds. Dillon Brooks scored 26 points, Ja Morant added 16 points and eight assists and the Grizzlies survived a late rally by Cleveland to defeat the Cavaliers 113-109 on Friday night for their seventh straight win. The Grizzlies failed to score in the final two minutes, allowing Cleveland to chop away at a 12-point lead. But after a trio of free throws by Kevin Love cut Memphis' advantage to 113-109 with 52.3 seconds left, the Cavaliers could get no closer as Love missed a pair of 3-point attempts in the final 11 seconds. We got defensive stops and we rebounded, Brooks said of overcoming the late scoring drought. They kept looking for Kevin Love to get that 3, and we were being patient enough, switching and getting him to take tough shots. Collin Sexton led Cleveland with 28 points and six assists, while Love added 19 points, missing all six of his 3-point shots as the Cavaliers lost their third straight and eighth in their last 10. They got on us, and we really fought back, Cleveland coach John Beilein said. We really had chances. A couple of more baskets going down the stretch, and we could have won the game. Cleveland trailed by as many as 21 early in the fourth, but had a couple of runs that brought the Cavaliers within single digits. An 8-1 Memphis rally extended the Grizzlies lead to 111-99 with three minutes left. Cleveland would close the game by outscoring the Grizzlies 10-2, but it wasnt enough to overtake Memphis. I dont think we played our best and they took advantage of it, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. These are situations weve faced a number of times during the season where youve got a lead and maybe a play here or there could have just flipped the game. But our guys stuck with it, despite having a mostly off night. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Played their fifth game of a six-game road trip. ... Darius Garland was 1 for 5 from 3-point range, ending a streak of 10 straight games with multiple 3-pointers. His 11 points kept alive his string of 11 straight reaching double figures. ... Tristan Thompson grabbed his third rebound of the game in the second quarter to pass Brad Daugherty (5,227) for third in Cavs history. Its an honor for sure to pass the great Brad Daugherty, Thompson said. Hes a Cavalier legend. Grizzlies: Jenkins announced before the game that former Memphis guard and defensive stalwart Tony Allen has been hired as head of player development for the G League Memphis Hustle. ... More than 1,000 Murray State fans attended the game. Morant, the second pick in last summers draft, played for the Racers. Murray, Kentucky, is about a three-hour drive from Memphis. ... Were 45 of 89 from the floor, and have shot at least 50% from the field in six of the past seven games. ... Jonas Valanciunas had 18 rebounds and four blocks. TRISTAN TOSSED Thompson was ejected in the third when he drew his second technical of the game after ongoing bickering with Grizzlies forward Jae Crowder. The two had drawn double-technicals earlier. Crowder was crossing through the lane after Thompson went to the foul line and the Cavalier popped Crowder on the backside. The two were teammates with Cleveland during the 2017-18 season. So, we have a history, and it was just a little competitive spirit, Thompson said. They might have taken it the wrong way because they may have forgotten we were teammates. Thompson added he is definitely calling (the Players Association) to appeal that. Ken Mauer, the officiating crew chief, told a pool reporter that the ejection was for the physical taunt, slap to the backside of Jae Crowder. Mauer said the ejection was simply for the butt slap and not anything to do with the previous incident where the two were assessed double-technicals.","401161264"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Kendrick Nunn continues to make good things happen for the Miami Heat. The rookie guard scored 22 points to help the Heat top the Oklahoma City Thunder 115-108 on Friday night. Nunn, the two-time Eastern Conference rookie of the month, was coming off a 33-point effort Wednesday in a win over San Antonio. Against the Thunder, he made 9 of 17 shots, including 3 of 5 3-pointers. Heat forward Jimmy Butler said Nunn's success and confidence come from hard work. ""Whether you're on the defensive end and you're working on the schemes of everything, or it's the offense and you're getting in your bag and you're working on shooting the ball -- he's constantly in the gym working on his game,"" Butler said. ""He will be in this league for a while."" Bam Adebayo had 21 points and eight rebounds to help the Heat win their second straight. Butler added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Even with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat had struggled a bit on the road. They evened their record at 11-11 away from home. ""This is a good one for sure,"" Heat forward Duncan Robinson said. ""This is a tough place to win."" Danilo Gallinari scored 27 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder each had 18 for the Thunder, who lost for the third time in four games. ""They were more physical,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""They cut harder. They just -- they beat us from the jump ball."" Miami led 61-47 at halftime behind 16 points from Adebayo on 7-for-8 shooting. The Heat entered the fourth quarter with a 92-78 edge. Miami expanded its lead to 105-83 with 8 minutes remaining before the Thunder made a push. Oklahoma City cut the deficit to seven on a 3-pointer by Paul with just over 2 minutes remaining but never got closer. ""Home teams are always going to make a run,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""This team is too good, too well coached, too many good players -- it's not going to be just a runaway going down the stretch. But you can see our effort level, and you know the ice that the guys are putting on right now -- it's well earned."" The Thunder have started a troublesome habit of digging holes for themselves at home. They fell behind by 32 against the Los Angeles Lakers last Saturday and 30 against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday before trailing by 22 on Friday. Each time, significant rallies fell short. ""We've got to figure it out because this kind of sucks right now,"" Paul said. TIP-INS Heat: The team said Justise Winslow will miss at least two more weeks while recovering from a back injury that has allowed him to play just one game since Dec. 4. The team originally called Winslow's injury a back strain, then updated the diagnosis to a bone bruise. He's averaging 11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.0 assists in 11 games this season. Thunder: C Steven Adams did not play. He left Wednesday's game against the Toronto Raptors with a right knee contusion. He averages 11.8 points 10.0 rebounds and 1.2 blocks. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  Vince Carter knows how difficult it is to win in San Antonio because he has experienced it for 22 seasons. Competing against the championship pedigree of the franchise, trying to tune out the frenzy of the sellout crowds at the AT&amp;T Center and struggling to overcome the defensive pressure created by San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. It's a good thing for Carter that his young teammates on the Atlanta Hawks weren't thinking about that pressure. Trae Young scored 31 points and Atlanta rallied from a 14-point deficit in the final quarter to stun the Spurs 121-120 on Friday night and snap a 21-game losing streak in San Antonio. ""It's funny when you play a team like the Spurs, how tough it is to win here,"" Carter said, ""but I think we are so young, we had no idea. So, it was to our advantage."" Second-year guard Kevin Huerter drained a 3-pointer from the left corner with 6.3 seconds remaining to complete the rally. DeMar DeRozan's driving runner over three players bounded off the backboard and rim, and the final buzzer sounded before the rebound could be collected. Atlanta won in San Antonio for the first time since Feb. 15, 1997, when the Hawks beat the Spurs 109-89. ""It's crazy, I hadn't even been born yet,"" Hawks rookie Cam Reddish said. Actually, six Hawks players hadn't been born the last time Atlanta won in San Antonio, including Young and Huerter. Reddish finished with 22 points, and Huerter and John Collins added 18 points each for Atlanta. LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and DeRozan added 24 for San Antonio, which lost for the third time in four games. San Antonio fell to Atlanta, who holds the league's second-worst record at 10-32, after beating Milwaukee, Boston and Toronto recently. Popovich said the Spurs weren't solid down the stretch, something that has plagued them all season. ""Where, all of a sudden, the game plan goes to hell, people don't execute and we played 24 minutes, in addition to that,"" he said. ""We did nothing in the first half but walk around. People should have left and asked for their money back after the first half. Second half, they competed, and they played to win, but we've just got to be more solid. Too many mistakes down the stretch and that's what always seems to happen when we lose a basketball game."" Aldridge fouled out with 1:09 remaining and the Spurs up 120-116. Young had 12 points in the final quarter to help the Hawks rally after blowing a 13-point lead in the first half. ""I always have faith until the clock says zero,"" Young said. ""I always feel like we have a chance to win."" San Antonio outscored Atlanta 41-21 in the third quarter, a point shy of matching their season high for the period. The Spurs had a 22-3 run during a four-minute stretch, holding the Hawks scoreless for 3:11 while taking a 94-79 lead. The run included Derrick White blocking Young's layup attempt, which led to DeRozan driving for a layup and then a 3-pointer from Patty Mills. Atlanta entered the final quarter trailing by 11, but closed to 110-106 following a 13-3 run fueled by the Hawks' young core of Young, Reddish and Huerter, before completing the rally. ""That's on us, strictly on us,"" DeRozan said. ""We can't be mad at nobody else but ourselves. We gave one away tonight."" Carter, making his final regular season appearance at the AT&amp;T Center, had 14 points for Atlanta. TIP-INS Hawks: Guard Jeff Teague was not with Atlanta after being acquired Thursday from Minnesota for Allen Crabbe. Teague, who spent his first seven seasons with the Hawks, rejoins Atlanta on Saturday against Detroit for the first time since 2016.

Spurs assistant Tim Duncan leads the team with 26,496 career points. . The Spurs have a losing record for 66 days this season after spending just 65 days below .500 from 1997-1998 to 2018-2019. . Rudy Gay sat out for the first time this season, missing the game with an undisclosed illness. CARTER CELEBRATED San Antonio paid tribute to Carter, who is retiring after 22 seasons, with a 1 1/2-minute video followed by a standing ovation. The video included Carter's fallaway 3-pointer for Dallas in Game 3 of the 2014 first-round playoffs, which San Antonio won in seven games on its way to a fifth league title. ""It caught me off guard, I wasn't prepared for it,"" Carter said. ""Didn't know it was happening. I've had some good moments, great history with Coach Popovich and the team. I mean good and bad, but just as far as conversation (with Popovich) and us just interacting. It's always been fun. For the organization to do something like this, it was nice.

"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic's pursuit of Jason Kidd's triple-double record in Dallas will have to wait. This night was about the 20-year-old sensation's 3-point shooting. Doncic drained a career-best eight 3s on his way to 35 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added 29 and the Mavericks beat Portland 120-112 on Friday night to avoid getting swept at home by the Trail Blazers. Doncic had eight rebounds and seven assists in the young Slovenian's first chance to tie Kidd's Dallas career record of 21 triple-doubles. As long as the next one comes before Feb. 28, Doncic will have at least three times as many triple-doubles before age 21 as the next person on the list -- Magic Johnson with seven. ""It's crazy,"" owner Mark Cuban said before the game. ""To give J-Kidd some credit, the game's a lot faster now, there's a lot more points being scored. So it's all relative. What he's accomplished is just phenomenal."" The 3 that topped Doncic's previous career best of seven was a punctuating 27-footer for an 11-point lead in the final minute. ""We were locked in at the end of the game,"" said Doncic, who was 8 of 12 from 3 to help the Mavericks finish 20 of 47 from beyond the arc compared to 9 of 30 for Portland, which was coming off an impressive win in Houston. Damian Lillard scored 34 points and Carmelo Anthony had 22 for the Blazers, who lost guard CJ McCollum to a sprained left ankle in the first half. Hassan Whiteside had 21 points and 18 rebounds. The Mavericks were without Doncic's European sidekick, Kristaps Porzingis, for the 10th consecutive game because of right knee soreness. The 7-foot-3 Latvian was ruled out early in the day after being a late scratch Wednesday in Sacramento. The Mavs kept Portland at a safe distance in the closing minutes after losing 121-119 in Dallas in October when the Blazers got a key reversal on a challenge of a foul call against Lillard in the final seconds. The Blazers won another challenge to reverse a foul call on Whiteside while trailing by six late in the fourth quarter, but it was right before Portland missed five straight shots in the final three minutes. ""Every time we play Dallas, we end up having one of these games,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""Very competitive, teams get leads and some other team comes back. Doncic is a great player and when he's making his 3s, even better."" Lillard had just two points on 1-of-6 shooting in the fourth quarter -- after playing half the game without McCollum when he was questionable himself before the game because of an illness. ""Obviously, I think any time you are under the weather, a little bit sick, it's going to have an effect on you on the floor,"" said Lillard, who was 13 of 25 from the field and added 10 assists. ""But I didn't go into the game thinking like, `Oh, I'm sick.' It was never an option for me to lean on that."" Before Doncic's definitive 3, Hardaway hit one with the Blazers within five with 4 minutes remaining after they had trailed by 17 late in the third quarter. He was 9 of 16 from the field and 5 of 8 from long range. ""Hardaway was great all night, great on both sides of the ball,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Aggressive, dialed in, high level of focus and concentration. The shot-making was brilliant."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Mario Hezonja returned after missing two games with a back contusion. He scored seven points in 19 minutes. ... G Gary Trent Jr. was ruled out by illness in the second half. Mavericks: Doncic was called for a flagrant foul on what appeared to be an inadvertent elbow to the face of Whiteside when Doncic was driving in the third quarter.

Doncic got fouled on made 3-pointers twice in the first half, missing the free throw the first time before making the second one for the four-point play. ANOTHER INJURY The Blazers will anxiously await word of how long McCollum will be sidelined. They've played all season with center Jusuf Nurkic, who averaged a double-double last season. Another key big man, Zach Collins, has been out since getting injured in the first game against Dallas -- the third of the season. ""Usually the second day's the worst, so see how it feels tomorrow,"" said McCollum, who was injured on a drive when his foot landed on Dallas forward Maxi Kleber's foot. ""Get some treatment tonight, try to compress it and see how it feels.""

"NEW ORLEANS --  As disappointed as Clippers coach Doc Rivers was to see his team give up 80 first-half points, he now has evidence that his team can do that and still find a way to win -- on the road. Kawhi Leonard scored 39 points and the Clippers rallied to beat the recently resurgent New Orleans Pelicans 133-130 on Saturday. Clearly, the defense didnt wake up for either team,"" Rivers said. ""It was one of those games where, at halftime, I said, Guys, first team that plays any defense will win this game. We played defense in the fourth, Rivers continued. ""Thats why we won. Lou Williams scored 14 of his 32 points during a dominant fourth quarter for Los Angeles, which outscored the Pelicans 31-20 in the final 12 minutes. I feel like I can make 100 in a row once I make one,"" Williams said of his fourth-quarter surge. ""I feel like I can make anything after that. Williams' 3 with 31.6 seconds left, after Patrick Beverley had rebounded Leonard's miss, gave the Clippers a 133-127 lead and sent numerous fans toward the exits. Very talented scorer -- fearless, just goes out there and plays the game,"" Leonard said of Williams. ""He pushed us to win that game in that fourth quarter. It just gives you relief that you have somebody that also can take over. JJ Redick hit a quick 3 in response to Williams' clutch basket, and after Leonard ran down the shot clock and missed from deep, New Orleans had 2.4 seconds to attempt a tying 3 that Redick missed off the back rim. The Pelicans can score. They've got a lot of talent over there,"" Leonard said. They have youth. ... They play hard. So Doc just wanted us to grind out the win.

Montrezl Harrell scored 24 points for the Clippers, who trailed by 10 in the final seconds of the third quarter, but turned Brandon Ingram's turnover into two free throws by Williams, and then opened the fourth with an 8-0 run -- capped by Williams' and JaMychal Green's back-to-back 3s -- to tie it at 110. After shooting 58.5% (38 of 65) in the first three quarters, the Pelicans made 8 of 21 shots in the fourth as the game slipped away from them. Both teams kind of slowed down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but I think we probably turned the ball over a couple of times and let a rebound get away, and they just went and made baskets, said Pelicans center Derrick Favors, who had 22 points and 11 rebounds. It was more maybe letting like little things take us out the game. Lonzo Ball had 18 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who were seeking their 11th victory in 15 games despite the recent absence of guard Jrue Holiday, who has missed seven games with an elbow injury. Beating the contending Clippers was going to be a tall order, but Ball asserted, I dont believe in moral victories. I thought we should have won the game. Ingram had 21 points and Redick finished with 19. The teams combined for 152 points in a fast-paced first half, during which New Orleans' 80 points tied a franchise record.

"Kyrie Irving speaks with the media about his and the Nets' championship aspirations. (0:39) NEW YORK --  Their lead was only nine with a minute left in the first half and it looked like the Milwaukee Bucks might be on their way to a close game. Then Khris Middleton hit two 3-pointers, and another rout was on for a team that just keeps racking them up.

Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points and 12 rebounds, Middleton scored 20 points, and the Bucks beat Brooklyn 117-97 on Saturday night for their sixth straight victory. The Bucks ran the NBA's best record to 38-6. They came in beating opponents by 12.4 points per game, which would be a league record if it holds up all season, and their lead was never below that after Middleton hit consecutive 3s in the final minute of the second quarter when Brooklyn trailed just 51-42. ""I think we're playing great basketball right now, but we know the later the season goes, the deeper we go into the playoffs, that we've got to continue to raise our level of play,"" Middleton said. Milwaukee coasted through the second half and fell just short of a fifth consecutive game with 120 points, which would have tied a franchise record set last season. The Bucks shot 50% from the field, made 17 3-pointers and held the short-handed Nets to 33% shooting. That wasn't enough to satisfy Antetokounmpo, the league MVP when the Bucks had the league's best record last year before they couldn't even reach the NBA Finals. ""We were good last year, but obviously we didn't win the championship,"" he said. ""We want to (be) a team that can be (there) at the end of the year to compete for the championship. We've got to get better. There's not another option."" Kyrie Irving had 17 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Nets. Rookie reserve Nic Claxton added 14 points and six boards. The Nets dropped their third straight as they scuffle through a rough part of their schedule that includes visits from both conference leaders in a six-night stretch. They host the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday. ""Great players come in and great teams come in, they're playing well. We're still trying to establish what that continuity, consistency looks like for us, so we'll continue to battle,"" Irving said. The Bucks, who didn't trail in either of their previous two games, fell behind by four early in this one. They quickly erased that and closed the first quarter with a 7-0 run for a 30-22 lead, then got 10 points apiece from Antetokounmpo and Middleton in the second quarter to extend the lead to 57-42. Antetokounmpo then knocked down Milwaukee's third straight 3 to open the scoring in the second half, and the lead would eventually grow to 25 points. Milwaukee has won 16 of the last 19 meetings. TIP-INS Bucks: Robin Lopez sat out because of an illness. ... Milwaukee scored 100 or more points for the 68th straight game, dating to last February, to break a tie with Dallas in the 1985-86 and 1986-87 seasons for the second-longest streak in the last 35 seasons. Denver did it in 75 straight games from Dec. 2, 1986, to Nov. 20, 1987. Nets: Brooklyn is without Joe Harris (sore lower back), DeAndre Jordan (dislocated right middle finger) and Garrett Temple (bruised right knee). Atkinson said there was a chance Temple and Harris could return Monday against Philadelphia. DURANT DOINGS Atkinson can see the progress, but he still doesn't expect to see Kevin Durant on the floor this season. ""No, I think we're all on the same page. That's not going to happen,"" the Nets coach said. That's the same thing Durant and the Nets said before the season, with the All-Star forward recovering from surgery for a ruptured Achilles tendon. Atkinson said he can tell that Durant is getting better, and even if he isn't on the court, he can still lend his knowledge on the bench and in the locker room. ""He's a quiet personality, but when he needs to say something he says it,"" Atkinson said. ""And usually what he says is spot on."" THE BROOKLYN BUCKS Milwaukee has won eight straight games in Brooklyn, the Nets' longest current home losing streak against an opponent. The Bucks' last loss at Barclays Center was a triple-overtime defeat on March 20, 2015, when Antetokounmpo was in his second season.","401161269"
"BOSTON -- Devin Booker sure loves playing in TD Garden. His near triple-double effort was just barely enough for the Phoenix Suns to overcome Boston guard Marcus Smart's performance. Booker had 39 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists and the Suns withstood a franchise-record 11 3-pointers by Smart and beat the Celtics 123-119 on Saturday. ""You know, Book is -- Book's Book,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""It's something I don't take for granted to have a guy that can get buckets like that."" Deandre Ayton had 26 points and 15 rebounds and Mikal Bridges added a career-best 26 points for the Suns, who have won four of their last five games. Smart shot 11 for 22 from 3-point range and finished with a career-best 37 points. He's the 11th player in NBA history to make at least 11 3-pointers in a game, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. ""He obviously was shooting confidently, made some big shots late into the game and into the (first) half,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's a tough guy and he got a lot of good looks and took advantage of it."" Jayson Tatum scored 26 points and Gordon Hayward added 22 for Boston, which has lost three straight and six of eight. Three years ago, Booker scored 70 points in a loss to the Celtics in TD Garden. He finished an assist shy of his first career triple-double. The Celtics were missing two of their top three leading scorers _ Kemba Walker (team-best 22.1 per game), out with left knee soreness, and Jaylen Brown (20.0), sidelined for the second straight game with a sprained right thumb. But Smart kept them in it. ""Right now, it means nothing,"" Smart said. ""I'd trade all that in for a win, especially the way the team has been playing."" Boston cut its deficit to 90-85 early in the fourth, but Dario Saric and Bridges answered with consecutive 3s. The Celtics had it down to 114-111 on Daniel Theis' breakaway dunk with about a minute left, but Bridges hit a jumper in the lane with 37 seconds to play. Booker's two free throws sealed it with 4.8 seconds left. ""I feel like there were times where we could've put them away, but (an) experienced team that has been in this situation before is never gonna give up,"" Booker said. The Suns led 60-51 at halftime and answered -- mainly behind Booker and Ayton -- any surge by Boston. The lead never fell below seven in the quarter, with Booker scoring nine points and Ayton getting eight. The loss of two key players showed for the Celtics in the first quarter when the Suns broke in front 26-10 before Boston's bench helped spark a 15-0 run. TIP-INS Suns: Ayton took an inadvertent elbow from Smart to mouth in the first quarter. After a brief stoppage to get checked, the 7-foot-1 center stayed in the game. . Booker also went to the floor hard after a collision with Smart in the second, but remained in after getting up slowly, and Ricky Rubio took a shot to the face in the fourth. Celtics: Tatum was taken out early after missing his first three shots. . Grant Williams started at forward and Hayward at guard. Stevens joked before the game that he didn't know who was starting and said: ""I think I told six guys and you can only have five."" TRYING EVERYTHING Stevens even used a different type of defense -- a box-and-one on Booker -- but that didn't work. ""We played a little bit of a zone and we were going to take our chances with other guys,"" he said. ""I think we played a triangle-and-two my second year (in Boston) in the playoffs against (Kyrie) Irving and (LeBron) James. That was probably the last time, but he was killing us."" EXTRA CHEERLEADERS Walker, dressed in jeans with a white hooded sweatshirt and a beige sports coat, offered any support he could, talking to the team on the bench during a timeout while the coaches were huddling off to the side after Boston fell behind early in the game. He was off the bench, clapping numerous times and patting teammates when they came out. Brown joined him, at times, offering encouragement. ACROBATIC On one of his baskets, Booker was fouled driving to his right, and, while in midair, shifted and flipped a shot in over shoulder across his body.","401161270"
"ATLANTA --  Derrick Rose has been rolling lately, and in a good way. The 11th-year point guard, in his first season with the Detroit Pistons, is easily handling the minutes load and producing at a high clip. Rose has battled injuries through much of his career, but the Pistons' decision to hold him back earlier in the season is paying off. ""I feel like they were being cautious,"" Rose said. ""I keep showing them. I'm coming in, doing what I'm supposed to do, taking care of my body. I've been prepping for this all summer, so it's finally just coming full circle."" Rose had 27 points and nine assists, Svi Mykhailiuk added 25 points in a reserve role, and Detroit won its second straight game with an easy 136-103 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. The Pistons had a season high in points and shot 59.3% from the field, two nights after shooting one percentage point better, a season high, in a win at Boston. Markieff Morris finished with 22 points off the bench, and Andre Drummond had 16 points, 17 rebounds and five steals as the Pistons won consecutive games for the first time since Dec. 9. They had gone 5-13 during that stretch. The loss spoiled Jeff Teague's first game back with the Hawks. Teague, who finished with 15 points and seven assists in 25 minutes, was traded from Minnesota to Atlanta two days eaerlier, returning to his adopted hometown team. John Collins scored 20 and De'Andre Hunter added 19 for the Hawks, who dropped to an Eastern Conference-worst 10-33 and rank third-worst overall in opponents' scoring average. They lacked energy after winning the night before at San Antonio for the first time in 21 years. ""We knew how they were going to attack us,"" Collins said ""We just didn't execute our plan well. We came out a little slow and they hit us first, and we really didn't respond too well."" Spurred on by Rose having his eighth straight game of at least 20 points and a bench that totaled 76 points, the Pistons were never threatened in the second half, leading by 23 on Sekou Doumbouya's 3 and Drummond's layup at the 8:19 mark of the third. The lead soon swelled to 97-69 on two free throws by Morris and stood at 120-89 on Mykhailiuk's 3 with 6:08 left in the game. Rose was the catalyst throughout, looking like his vintage self when he picked off Trae Young, the NBA's leader in turnovers and the league's third-leading scorer, to feed Mykhailiuk for a layup that made it 112-78 with 10:21 remaining. ""I told him the other day he's looking like his (2011) MVP season, man,"" Morris said. ""He's quick. He's making great decisions on the ball. He can play either off the bench or as a starter. Obviously we need to him to start because he's scoring at a high level and leading this team."" Detroit took its first double-digit lead on Morris' 3 at the 4:30 mark of the first. The Pistons went up 65-45 with 3:42 left before halftime on a pair of free throws by Langston Galloway. TIP-INS Pistons: At 16-27, Detroit is ninth in the East and three games out of the final playoff spot. ... Rose, who went 12 for 17 from the field in 26 minutes, started his second straight game. ... Morris, who scored 23 points at Boston, went 7 for 10 against Atlanta and is 16 for 24 from the field in his last two games. ... F Blake Griffin, a six-time All-Star, was out for the 25th game because of left knee surgery. ... G Reggie Jackson missed his 41st game with a lumbar stress reaction. Hawks: Young scored 16 points, 13 less than his season average. He was 6 for 16 from the field as Bruce Brown teamed with Rose and Tim Frazier to frustrate him throughout. ... C Alex Len missed his third straight game with lower back pain. ... F Jabari Parker is still sidelined by a right shoulder impingement. ... Atlanta has lost 25 of 27 when trailing after the third. CAN'T STAND IT Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce, a native Californian and lifelong Oakland Raiders fan, said he won't allow himself to watch the San Francisco 49ers play Sunday for a trip to the Super Bowl. ""There's nothing worse than the Niners being really good right now,"" Pierce said. ""I'm (perturbed). I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow, but I don't want to watch the game. I want to watch football, but I don't want to watch because I don't want to see them win. I'm afraid they're going to win."" Pierce said he plans to see a couple of games next season when the Raiders open their new home in Las Vegas. ""I think Vegas is the absolute perfect destination for a Raiders team,"" Pierce said. ""I really fear for the city. I think Vegas is rough enough as it is. It's going to be a lot rougher with Raiders being there every weekend.""","401161271"
"NEW YORK --  The 76ers haven't won as much on the road as they'd like. They relied on defense to get it done at Madison Square Garden. Tobias Harris hit a go-ahead 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter, Ben Simmons had 21 points and Philadelphia beat the New York Knicks 90-87 on Saturday night for its third straight victory. ""I thought our defense really fueled us throughout the game,"" Harris said. ""We did a good job defensively of getting our stops, getting out in transition."" Josh Richardson added 18 points and reserve Furkan Korkmaz scored 17 for the 76ers, who snapped a six-game road losing streak. Their last win away from home was Dec. 23 at Detroit. Philadelphia is 28-16 overall but just 8-14 on the road. It was the second straight game -- and the third overall this season -- that the 76ers held an opponent under 90 points. ""It was a real sense of urgency of getting a win on the road and getting stops down the stretch,"" Al Horford said. ""Defensively, this was kind of like an old-school type of game."" Marcus Morris Sr. scored 20 points and missed a half-court heave at the buzzer for the Knicks, who have lost three straight. Julius Randle had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Philadelphia scored five straight points to extend its lead 84-77 on a three-point play from Harris with 6:45 left in the fourth quarter. New York then rallied late with a 10-2 run and took a 87-86 lead when Morris sank a jumper over Simmons with 31 seconds left in regulation. The 76ers called a timeout to advance the ball past half court and Simmons found a wide-open Harris -- who made 5 of 13 shots and finished with 15 points -- for his fourth 3-pointer of the night to put Philadelphia ahead 89-87 with 28 seconds to play. New York had a chance to tie, but Simmons and Harris swarmed Randle on an inbound play and forced the ball out of bounds. ""We were trying to get Marcus the ball on the elbow and clear some room for him going to his right and they pushed everything left and trapped us on that side,"" Randle said. ""We got caught in a bad position."" Korkmaz's free throw with 4.2 seconds left sealed it for the 76ers. Simmons had 16 points to help the 76ers build a 52-46 lead heading into the half. He shot 7 for 10 from the field and had couple of dunks in transition that brought the Madison Square Garden crowd to its feet, including a noticeable Philly contingent. SIDELINE VIEW Two-time MVP Steve Nash watched from courtside and got an up-close view of Simmons directing the Sixers' offense. ""Ben is a generational talent. Crazy athlete. He can play multiple positions on offense and defense,"" Nash said. ""Obviously, his glaring weakness is his shooting, but he is so gifted that he can make up for it in other ways, and it's about finding a way for him to be at his best in this group and that's a challenge in this club -- how all the pieces fit together."" The two chatted briefly in the visitors' locker room after the game. Simmons said he was looking to pick up some pointers from the eight-time All Star. ""He was just a great leader. I was watching highlights of some of his games, the way he played,"" Simmons said. ""He was relentless. He played through everything."" TIP-INS Sixers: Matisse Thybulle has notched at least one steal and one block in his last five games. The last Philadelphia rookie to do so was Simmons during the 2017-18 season. Thybulle leads all NBA rookies with 16 games of at least one steal and one block. Knicks: Reggie Bullock had 14 points and Elfrid Payton added 10 points, seven assists and seven rebounds.","401161272"
"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls overcame a poor performance in the first three quarters with a strong finish. Zach LaVine scored 21 of his 42 points in the fourth and the Bulls rallied from 15 points down in the final period for a 118-116 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night. Chicago, which trailed by as many as 19 points, held the Cavaliers to 14 points in the fourth and forced 10 turnovers. Lauri Markkanen scored 17 points for the Bulls, who have won two of three. LaVine has scored at least 20 points in 10 straight games. ""We just put together a last little run, and we did it at the right time,"" LaVine said. ""Sometimes, all it takes is seven or eight good minutes of a good run and you can win the game. ""It was ugly up to that point, but we turned it around, and that's all that matters."" Kevin Love had 29 points and Collin Sexton added 26 as Cleveland dropped its fourth straight. ""It stings to lose this game,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""Forget about the lead that we had ... we're just better than 26 turnovers. We sometimes get a little too anxious or try to do too much and we have to work harder as a coaching staff at fundamentals."" With the Bulls leading 114-111, the Cavaliers appeared to have a chance to tie the game as Love drove the baseline for a basket and Markkanen was called for a touch foul by referee Ashley Moyer-Gleich with 20.1 seconds left. However, Bulls coach Jim Boylen challenged the call and the foul was rescinded after review -- giving the Chicago the ball with a 114-113 lead. ""I knew I didn't push him,"" Markkanen said. ""I was confident they were going to overturn the call. I wasn't really surprised."" LaVine then stretched it to 117-113 with a three-point play with 16.5 seconds left. Cedi Osman hit a 3-pointer with 11.4 seconds remaining to make it a one-point game, The Cavaliers got the ball back following a turnover, but Love missed inside and Chicago hung on. ""I did have a good look,"" Love said. ""I probably should've not tried to bank it."" After leading 33-31 at the end of the first quarter, Cleveland opened up a big lead by outscoring Chicago 40-25 in the second. The Cavaliers were 14 for 17 (82.4%) from the field, including 7 of 9 on 3-pointers. Those numbers included a miss on a heave from just inside the half-court line before the halftime buzzer. Love set the pace for Cleveland's 73-56 lead at the intermission with 23 points on 9-for-11 shooting, including 4 of 6 on 3-pointers. The 12th-year forward entered averaging 17.1 points. The Cavaliers took a 102-87 lead into the fourth and appeared in control. But Chicago suddenly came to life, opening the quarter with a 16-2 run and pulling within 104-103 with just over six minutes left. TIP-INS Cavaliers: G Dante Exum (right ankle) was doubtful when the team arrived at the United Center, but decided to play after testing it. He finished with two points in 15 minutes. Bulls: Markkanen attempted only two shots in the second half of Friday's loss at Philadelphia, which was a hot topic pregame. ""He didn't shoot the ball enough last night,"" Boylen said. ""It's not that he wasn't involved. I have to make sure he gets more than two shots."" SMALL LINEUP For most of the fourth, the Bulls used a lineup with Markkanen at center and Chandler Hutchison at power forward. ""It was an aggressive lineup,"" LaVine said. ""We were out there making plays and we needed to. With Hutch out there, he can get a rebound and push it, too, so it makes us a lot faster."" TRAVEL WOES Both teams played on the road Friday night and were scheduled to fly to Chicago immediately after the game, but neither were able to take off. The winter storm that moved across the East and Midwest stranded the Bulls in Philadelphia and the Cavaliers in Memphis. Each team landed in Chicago late Saturday morning. ""If we couldn't land in Chicago, then they couldn't land here, either,"" Beilein said. ""Both of us are coming off tough losses and we both have to deal with it.""","401161273"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Fred VanVleet knew he was on a minutes restriction as he made his return from a hamstring injury after missing five games. The Raptors guard tried not to think much about it while on the court. Instead, he made the most of the minutes he did play. VanVleet led Toronto with 29 points as the Raptors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 122-112 on Saturday night. Kyle Lowry added 28 points and seven assists while Norman Powell scored 20 points off the bench for the Raptors, who have won three straight games. Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins recorded his first career triple-double. He had 18 points, a career-high 11 assists and 10 rebounds. Rookie Jarrett Culver had 26 points for the Timberwolves, who have lost five straight. VanVleet's injury sidelined him for five games before Saturday. He was 11 of 16 from the field and 7 of 8 from 3-point range. ""It looked like it was just riding a bike,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of VanVleet. ""He was really good."" Nurse said pregame that VanVleet would play between 25 to 28 minutes. He played 28:30 -- the most of any Raptor on Saturday. ""I think playing at ease like that allowed me to not press and just let the game come to me,"" said VanVleet, who scored 10 points in the fourth quarter. Toronto took a five-point lead into the fourth quarter thanks in large part to Lowry's efforts in the third. Lowry scored 17 points in the quarter to erase a four-point halftime deficit. The Raptors pushed the lead to as many as 22 in the fourth. Serge Ibaka and Powell each had six points off the bench during a 21-6 stretch to open the period. ""They kind of extended the lead and it was kind of hard to come back after that,"" Wiggins said. Saturday was the second night of back-to-back games for both teams. Toronto beat Washington 140-111 on Friday, while Minnesota lost 116-114 at Indiana. Minnesota got big first quarters from Wiggins and Culver. Wiggins had 11 points on 4-of-4 shooting and added five assists in the quarter. Culver led Minnesota with 14 points in the first, including 4 of 6 from deep. ""He shot ten 3s and made four,"" Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said of Culver. ""I was happy with him tonight."" TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto scored 58 points in the paint. . Powell's 20-point game was the fourth time this season he's topped 20 points while coming off the bench. . Pascal Siakam and Marc Gasol both picked up technical fouls with 1:01 to play in the first half. Timberwolves: G Allen Crabbe was inactive Saturday with an illness. Minnesota acquired Crabbe on Thursday in a trade with Atlanta that sent Jeff Teague and Treveon Graham to the Hawks. . Culver topped 20 points for the fourth time this season. CHEERING SECTIONS Raptors coach Nick Nurse grew up in Carroll, Iowa, and was initially planning on a big group of family members making the 4-hour drive to Minneapolis. But those plans were thwarted by a snowstorm Friday night. ""There were at least one or two buses coming up from my hometown and that all got canceled,"" Nurse said. Raptors guard Matt Thomas only played 3 minutes but had his own fan club that was vocal the few times he stepped on the court. Thomas grew up in Onalaska, Wisconsin, 145 miles from Minneapolis. QUIET KAT Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns had 12 points in the first half but was held scoreless after halftime. It was Towns' second game back after missing 15 games with a combination of a knee injury and illness.

"LeBron James breaks down the Lakers' 124-115 victory over the Rockets and reacts to receiving ""MVP"" chants in Houston. (1:47) HOUSTON --  The Los Angeles Lakers were determined to start the second half of their season on a high note following a loss that snapped a nine-game winning streak. They were able to do that by riding a big third quarter to a 124-115 win over the Houston Rockets. LeBron James had 31 points and 12 assists for the Lakers, who lost to Orlando on Wednesday night. We hated the loss that we had the other night against Orlando,"" James said. So we had a couple of days to kind of just reshape, refocus and start the second half of the season the right way, and we did that tonight."" The loss was the third straight for the Rockets, which tied a season high, and they have dropped four of five. We're just not playing well right now,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. We haven't played well for a couple of weeks. And the only way you can get out of it is play hard, keep your head down and just go forward."" Kyle Kuzma scored 23 points, and Danny Green and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope each had 20 for the Lakers. Russell Westbrook scored 35 points for his fourth straight 30-point game and James Harden had 34 for the Rockets, who also lost three in a row in late November. Harden is confident the Rockets can break out of their funk. Everybody throughout the course of your career has been through some tough times and the only way you can get through them is continue to work and continue to go hard and mentally lock in and just try to be as solid as possible, Harden said. James was impressed with the work Kuzma did against Westbrook in the second half when he was held to 13 points. Kuz just kept his body in front of him and made him take tough shots,"" James said. He made a couple but Kuz made it tough on him, so that helped changed the game for us."" Los Angeles didn't lead in the first half but used a 32-point third quarter to take a nine-point lead into the fourth. Houston used a 6-0 run to cut the lead to 10 with about seven minutes left, but the Lakers scored the next six points to extend it to 110-94 midway through the quarter. That sent many Rockets fans streaming for the exits and caused a large contingent of Lakers fans to start chanting, Let's go Lakers. The Rockets did not get closer than seven points the rest of the way. The Lakers opened the second half with a 10-3 run to take their first lead of the game, 69-68, with about eight minutes left in the third quarter. James capped that run by making a basket and then added another one seconds later after JaVale McGee blocked a dunk attempt by Clint Capela. McGee beat his chest and screamed after in Capela's direction after the play and received a technical foul for taunting. We picked up our intensity,"" Dwight Howard said. Then JaVale got some big blocks, which got us out in the open court. So we've just got to make sure we continue to do that."" There were about seven minutes left in the third when Westbrook and Anthony Davis, who missed the game with an injury, both received technical fouls for jawing at each other. The Lakers led by three later in the third when Kuzma scored the first four points of a 9-2 run that stretched the lead to 85-75. Houston had a chance to cut the deficit at the end of the third quarter, but Westbrook missed two free throws to leave the Lakers up 91-82 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Lakers: Davis missed a fifth straight game with a bruised backside. ... Howard received a technical foul early in the third quarter for yelling at Houston players from the bench. ... Kuzma went to the locker room briefly in the third quarter to get his left ankle re-taped and returned to start the fourth. Rockets: Westbrook is the first Rocket besides Harden to score 30 points in four straight games since Tracy McGrady did it in six games in a row in the 2006-07 season. ... Eric Gordon had 13 points. ... Capela had 12 rebounds. HE SAID IT James on what it meant to have so many Laker fans in Houston on Saturday night: It's very humbling.

"SAN FRANCISCO --  With wins so hard to come by for the injury-plagued Warriors, every one means a little more now to coach Steve Kerr. The Golden State of old just expected to pile up victories -- and now things are completely the opposite with Kevin Durant having departed for Brooklyn and Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson sidelined. D'Angelo Russell scored 26 points and dished out a season-high 12 assists, and the Warriors snapped their longest losing streak in nearly 18 years at 10 games by beating the Orlando Magic 109-95 on Saturday night. ""We've had a couple of long losing streaks that are really, really difficult to live with,"" Kerr said. ""You just feel bad for the players and the organization, people who are working so hard every day. You want to see everybody happy and you want to see the fans happy. I thought today meant a lot to the group, to the players, but I could tell it meant a lot to the fans, too. They were really happy, so you just need to win and keep things moving forward, even if you're 10-34 like we are. You've got to win one occasionally to keep the spirit up. I think that's what made today such a good win."" Jordan Poole scored 21 points off the bench and Eric Paschall had 20 points and nine rebounds as Golden State also ended a five-game skid at home. Markelle Fultz scored 23 points to lead the Magic, who came in with two close victories in three games on their West Coast swing. Forward Aaron Gordon summed up coach Steve Clifford's message: The Magic didn't compete. ""We played soft, not enough energy and we've just got to play better, especially the starting unit,"" Gordon said. The Warriors' 10-game skid was their longest winless stretch since also dropping 10 in a row from March 9-24, 2002. Russell and rookie Poole each hit four 3-pointers, and Poole scored in double figures for his career-best fourth straight game and 13th in all this season. He recently returned from a stint in the G League and has been far more consistent with his shot. The Warriors were down to nine players again with Draymond Green sitting out because of a sprained left index finger. It's the sixth game he has missed this season with the injury. Golden State lost guard Jacob Evans III to a concussion on Tuesday night against Dallas. The Warriors have won eight of 10 at home against the Magic and seven straight. ""All we can do with the amount of guys we have and the amount of experience we have, we just have to keep on going into these games and learning from them and not reverting back to stuff that causes us to lose games,"" center Willie Cauley-Stein said. ""It's building on the intensity, building on taking care of the ball, building on while they're up in transition not giving up easy buckets. The last couple games we've doing that and we finally got that W."" Evan Fournier scored 12 points in 32 minutes for Orlando. He went through a warm-up to determine whether he had regained enough strength to play after he was sick and in bed all day Friday. Orlando hit five of its first eight shots with two 3s by Fournier and jumped out to a 13-0 lead as Golden State missed its initial seven shots -- four from deep -- and committed three turnovers before Poole's 3 at the 7:10 mark of the first quarter.

"Adrian Wojnarowski reveals the Trail Blazers are trading Kent Bazemore, Anthony Tolliver and two second-round picks to the Kings for Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan. (0:37) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Chris Paul had become annoyed with Oklahoma City's recent slow starts, so he did something about it. He scored 21 of his 30 points in the first half, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers 119-106 on Saturday night. Forward Danilo Gallinari, Oklahoma City's No. 2 scorer, rested. That prompted Paul to look for his shot more. Just trying to be aggressive,"" he said. ""You know, without Danilo, we've got to find scoring. So I tried to come out and pick my spots early and made a few shots early. Portland coach Terry Stotts has seen it all before during Paul's 15-year NBA career. Paul was a really good player tonight, Stotts said. Well, he's been a really good player for his career, but he had a really good game tonight. He managed the game, scored. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 22 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder and Nerlens Noel each added 15 points for Oklahoma City. The Trail Blazers had just eight players available. Portland's Kent Bazemore and Anthony Tolliver were not with the team, and coach Terry Stotts declined comment amid reports that the players were to be traded to Sacramento in exchange for Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan. Portland guard C.J. McCollum was out with a sprained left ankle. He ranks second on the team, averaging 21.5 points. Damian Lillard, who played despite dealing with an upper respiratory illness, led the Trail Blazers with 34 points. Gary Trent Jr. scored a career-high 30. The Thunder led 64-57 at halftime, a switch from recent games with big deficits against the Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat. We just didn't have to play from behind,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""We knew what we needed to do going into this game. We are coming off a back-to-back. We knew it would be a little bit tough, but if we wanted to win, we had to do it, and we did it tonight. Lillard scored 24 points in the first half to keep the Trail Blazers in it, but Oklahoma City pushed its lead to 87-77 after three quarters and cruised in the fourth. Stotts wasn't sure if his team wore out. That's possible,"" he said. ""You know, we were hanging close. They made some runs. I don't know if we ran out of gas or not. The minutes were kind of under control, but like I said, I thought it was mostly Chris Paul's impact on the game more than anything else. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Bazemore, a forward, has started 21 games this season, including Portland's loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Friday. He averages 7.9 points and 4.0 rebounds. Tolliver has started nine games this season. He played 17 minutes against Dallas. ... Carmelo Anthony, who played one season with the Thunder, got a warm reception from the fans. ...

His father, Gary Sr., played nine years in the league and only scored more than 30 points twice -- 33 and 32 points for the Dallas Mavericks during the 1998-99 season. CUTTING IT CLOSE Things could have been even worse for the Trail Blazers -- with only three active reserves. Nassir Little and Jaylen Hoard finished with five fouls.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Rudy Gobert is known for his defense. Against Sacramento, he went to the rim time and again on offense. ""Rudy was like a monster, so great on offense and, as usual, defensively protecting all us,"" Bojan Bogdanovic said. Gobert had a season-high 28 points and 15 rebounds and the Utah Jazz raced to a 16-point lead in the first quarter and routed the Sacramento Kings 123-101 on Saturday night. Gobert got most of his points on dunks, while Bogdanovic had six 3-pointers on his way to 30 points. Donovan Mitchell contributed 22 for Utah. ""Rudy is such a threat and finishing in the paint, it opens it up and makes it easier for us,"" Mitchell said. De'Aaron Fox scored 21 points before fouling out, and Marvin Bagley added 17 for the Kings (15-27), who lost their fourth straight. ""They took us out of everything we wanted to do,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""We talk about wanting to get up a certain amount of 3s. We couldn't get 3s because we couldn't penetrate and make two players guard us."" Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan were not with the Kings, and Walton declined to comment before the game amid reports that the players were to be traded to Portland in exchange for Kent Bazemore, Anthony Tolliver and two future second-round draft picks. The Jazz have won 16 of 18 and had their 10-game winning streak snapped in overtime against New Orleans on Thursday. It didn't take long to shake off the disappointment. Utah started the game by converting on nine straight possessions and jumping to a 24-10 lead. The one time the Jazz missed a shot, Gobert gobbled up the rebound and dunked it. Nearly six minutes elapsed before Utah had a scoreless trip down the floor. ""I was trying to be aggressive and all the guys did a great job finding me . all I had to do is finish,"" Gobert said. Utah's swift ball movement had the Sacramento defense spinning. In one 10-second sequence, Utah fired six quick passes that covered both sides of the court and broke the lane three times, ending with a wide-open corner 3-pointer from Mitchell. ""They have to chase people around for almost 24 seconds and it's just demoralizing for them. It's a huge play,"" Gobert said. Utah coach Quin Snyder beamed when recalling the possession. ""We have a group that plays for each other. When you do that, the basket gets bigger and everyone shoots with confidence because they feel they are supposed to. There is never a `my turn.' It's always `our turn,"" Snyder said. The Kings shot 48.8%, but never got with single digits after Utah's opening run. Mike Conley, who missed 19 of the Utah's last 20 games due to a left hamstring strain that was first suffered in the Jazz's road loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Dec. 12, returned to a standing ovation and finished with three points and three assists in 15 minutes. ""Mike is a key piece of what we want to do. I know we didn't want to rush him but it's great to have him back,"" Gobert said, noting one of his assists led to an easy dunk for him. Bogdanovic was also back after nursing an ankle injury for the last six games, finishing with 11 points. The Jazz beat the Kings by 32 early in the season and Sacramento hasn't suffered a loss as large as this 22-point defeat since. ""Sometimes, it happens so fast that we just don't communicate and I think we keep allowing that to happen we're just going to get beat all game like we did tonight,"" Bagley said. NO TV FOR JAZZ FANS If Jazz fans in the Intermountain area weren't at the game in person, they couldn't see it.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Patty Mills celebrated his heritage Sunday with a performance that typified his career. Mills provided a late spark, LaMarcus Aldridge scored 21 points and the San Antonio Spurs held off the Miami Heat 107-102 Sunday. The win came as San Antonio became the first NBA team to hold Indigenous People Night -- a meaningful cause to Mills, who is an Australian of aboriginal descent. ""It's an important night and it's really important to Patty,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""For the indigenous people here in Texas it's important to all of us, but it's sort of double for him because of his history and his background. ""He didn't play like he did because of that; he does that every night. His energy has been there his whole career. It's who he is."" Mills had 18 points and DeMar DeRozan added 20 as San Antonio snapped a two-game skid. Mills requested the Spurs honor his ancestry as well as those of Native Americans, and the franchise obliged on the eve of Martin Luther King Day. ""Besides basketball, it was a win for us to be able to use basketball as a platform to be able to share culture and traditions and you saw it tonight,"" Mills said. Miami's Duncan Robinson missed a 3-pointer with 10.2 seconds left and the Heat trailing 105-102. Miami fouled Marco Belinelli, who made both free throws to cap the scoring. ""It's a big moment,"" Robinson said. ""I want to make that shot for this team. I didn't do it. I'm disappointed in myself, but it's nice to know these guys have my back no matter what."" Bam Adebayo had 21 points, 16 rebounds and six assists for Miami, which had won its previous two games. Goran Dragic added 19 points and Kendrick Nunn had 18. ""I actually liked the way we competed,"" said Heat forward Jimmy Butler, who had 16 points. The Spurs rebounded -- barely -- after blowing a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter against Atlanta in a 121-120 defeat Friday. ""We fresh off a feeling of letting a game slip away from us,"" DeRozan said. ""Being right back in that position, just kind of understanding how hard we needed to play down the stretch, how hard it was going to be."" Mills fueled a late run by diving out of bounds and throwing the ball off Miami center Meyers Leonard to salvage an offensive possession. With cheers of ""Patty, Patty,"" still ringing throughout the AT&amp;T Center, Aldridge drained a hook shot to pull the Spurs within 98-97 with 4:39 remaining. A few possessions later, Derrick White used a backhanded stab to deflect and steal an attempted entry pass at the top of the key by Adebayo. That led to a three-point play by Aldridge for a 102-98 lead with 3:20 remaining. ""It was a big play,"" White said. ""I was just trying to be active, get my hands on the ball and make a play."" TIP-INS Heat: G Tyler Herro missed the game with a bruised left knee. ... F James Johnson was limited to five points in 15 minutes after helping Miami win for just the fourth time ever in San Antonio last season.

His work with the indigenous people of Australia led him to become active with the Native American population in Texas. ""He's just a caring individual,"" Popovich said of Mills. ""He cares about people, this was something that fit perfectly for him and his interests that's why he carried through with it and tried to bring attention to it.""","401161279"
"DENVER --  Despite playing from behind for most of their game against the Denver Nuggets, Domantas Sabonis never felt the Indiana Pacers were out of it. Sabonis had 22 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his first career triple-double, Doug McDermott scored 18 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and the Pacers rallied late to beat the Nuggets 115-107 on Sunday night. ""I just felt like we were always right there, down 5-6 points all game,"" Sabonis said. ""I felt like this was the game we needed to get to start the road trip right and just believed in my teammates that we could make that next step. And in the fourth quarter everybody stepped up and made big-time plays."" In one sequence with just under three minutes remaining, Sabonis helped protect the Pacers' late lead by fighting through traffic in the low post to grab three offensive rebounds before finishing with a tip-in. ""McDermott killed us. Sabonis killed us,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""The fourth quarter, they had six offensive rebounds. The very few times they did miss, they just pushed us around, much more physical than us. Disappointing loss."" Malcom Brogdon and T.J. Warren added 22 points each for the Pacers, who snapped a 10-game skid at Pepsi Center. They overcame a 30-point performance from the Nuggets' Nikola Jokic to win their fifth straight. ""We just played really well together out there in the fourth quarter,"" McDermott said. ""We had a lot of shots fall and I thought we did a good job on defense and rebounding."" Jerami Grant and Will Barton added 16 points apiece for the Nuggets, who were again without injured starters Paul Millsap, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray. Denver had the lead for most of the game but was outscored 41-26 in the fourth quarter. The Nuggets missed 10 of 32 free throws and were 3 of 23 from 3-point range while the Pacers connected on 13 of 29 from beyond the arc, including six 3-pointers by McDermott. ""I think we got real relaxed and we didn't play with a sense of urgency, especially in the second half,"" said Michael Porter Jr., who scored 10 points for Denver. ""I think we kind of gave that one away."" Brogdon connected on a 3-pointer in the waning seconds of the third quarter and the Pacers pulled within 81-74 going into the final period.

"WASHINGTON --  In a rebuilding season for the Washington Wizards, coach Scott Brooks still closely monitors the standings, and while it's unlikely, he still believes his team has a chance to qualify for the playoffs. The Wizards began the second half of the season by beating one of the teams ahead of them in the Eastern Conference. Bradley Beal scored 29 points, Ian Mahinmi added 21 and Washington broke a three-game losing streak with a 106-100 win over the Detroit Pistons on Monday. Beal passed Wes Unseld for fourth place on the team's career scoring list. Washington is 14-26, but the Brooklyn Nets, who hold the eighth spot in the East, are only 18-24 after their loss to Philadelphia on Monday. Chicago, Detroit and Charlotte are also ahead of Washington. I watch the games. I watch the standings, Brooks said. We're not talking about it. We're just going to try to get better every game."" The Wizards' hopes have been damaged by a spate of injuries to key players, but as those players return, Brooks gets more optimistic. The seventh and eighth seed, their records aren't great, but I'm sure somebody's going to surprise somebody and probably jump up there, Brooks said. In Beal's first seven seasons, he's played in the postseason four times. That's the goal, Beal said. That's every day for us. That's in the back of my head. Especially when (the) All-Star (break) hits, that second half is just flying. We've got to tighten up. Derrick Rose led Detroit with 21 points while Andre Drummond had 18 points and 16 rebounds. The Pistons were trying to three games in a row for the first time this season. We lost this game defensively, bro, Rose said. Second half, we just let them get anywhere on the court that they wanted. Drummond had a season-high nine turnovers. We can't have our center having nine turnovers, Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. We want him to get the ball in to Rose. He's got to make decisions, and he's done a good job of that, but tonight he did not. And normally he and our bigs do a good job of catching it, kicking it out and making a play and not turning it over. There were 10 lead changes, four in succession early in the fourth quarter, and Davis Bertans' 3-pointer with 9:02 to play gave the Wizards the lead for good. Washington scored nine straight to take a 95-87 lead two minutes later. TIP-INS Pistons: G Reggie Jackson, who hasn't played since the second game of the season because of a back injury, should be able to play this week, Casey said. He's been practicing dunking on people and talking more than anybody else. ... In advance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the Pistons visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Sunday night. ... Detroit has lost 10 straight at Washington. Wizards: C Anzejs Pasecniks sprained his left ankle in practice Sunday and missed the game. ... G Jordan McRae, who twisted his left ankle early in Friday's loss at Toronto, scored seven points. ... G Garrison Mathews (ankle) missed his sixth straight game and will likely miss another two weeks, Brooks said. FLAGRANT Detroit's Markieff Morris was ejected from the game with 7:06 to play when he tangled with Bertans and hit him in the head. Morris was assessed a Flagrant 2. After the game, Bertans wasn't sure what happened. He's the only one who can answer that question, Bertans said. I have no clue what that was. Casey didn't dispute the call. Markieff was probably warranted (in being) tossed out, Casey said. He hit the guy in the head. Morris declined to comment on the incident.

"ATLANTA --  Norman Powell says nothing has changed, even though he's in the best streak of his highest-scoring season. It may feel normal to the Toronto Raptors' sixth man. The results definitely look different. Powell scored 27 points, including 17 in the final period, and the Raptors withstood Atlanta's late charge to beat the Hawks 122-117 on Monday. Trae Young had 42 points and season-high 15 assists for Atlanta. Powell has scored 20 or more points in five straight games, the longest stretch of his career. He is averaging 15.8 points per game. The previous best mark of his five-year career was 8.6 last season. ""I'm just taking the same shots I've been taking,"" Powell said after Toronto's fourth straight win. ""I have confidence in my game, confidence in my shot."" The high-scoring streak came after Powell missed 11 games with a left shoulder injury. Toronto led 112-91 before surviving a late comeback by the Hawks, who pulled within two points at 117-115. Fred VanVleet, who had 20 points, sank three free throws with 14.2 seconds remaining after he was fouled by John Collins, pushing the lead to five. Powell had only 10 points through three quarters before finding his 3-point range in the final period to lead Toronto's productive second unit. ""It was just him being him,"" Young said of Powell. ""He's a great scorer. ... It's tough when he gets going."" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said the best strategy against Powell was ""don't let him touch it."" The backups were on the floor when Toronto made its comeback in the third quarter and remained in the game for most of the final period. ""The second unit came in and did a great job,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""They took a big deficit to a really big lead. We needed it all at the end."" Young's four-point play cut Toronto's lead to 114-107 with 1:39 remaining. Collins' layup reduced the deficit to two points. Powell made three straight 3s to lead the Raptors' decisive surge early in the final period. After Serge Ibaka added a 3, Powell continued his hot streak with another long-range shot, this one a 27-footer. Powell made 6 of 9 3s. ""He was dialed in there, for sure,"" Nurse said. Pascal Siakam scored 18 points for the Raptors. Toronto scored the first nine points and quickly stretched the lead to 12 points, at 34-22, in the first period. But this would not be a runaway for the defending NBA champions. Atlanta outscored Toronto 35-21 in the second period to lead 60-57 at halftime and then opened strong in the second half.

"NEW YORK --  Ben Simmons was chosen Monday as the Eastern Conference player of the week for the way he performed last week. Then he got a sensational start on winning the next week's award, too. Simmons tied a career high with 34 points and added 12 rebounds and 12 assists, carrying the Philadelphia 76ers to a 117-111 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. ""I mean, Ben Simmons was ridiculously dominant tonight,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. A point guard by skill but at 6-foot-10 a big man in size, Simmons played all over the floor for a 76ers team missing All-Star center Joel Embiid. The Nets tried guarding him with big men but that didn't work -- though nothing may have the way he played. ""I just came in with that mindset to win,"" Simmons said. ""I know it's going to be tough every time we play teams like this."" Simmons shot 12 for 14 from the field in his career-best fifth straight game with 20 or more points, finishing with his fourth triple-double of the season. The NBA leader in steals had five of them. ""Just his determination,"" Brown said when asked what impressed him most about Simmons' performance. ""Like, there was a determination, there was a spirit, there was a committed performance offensively and defensively that he just wasn't going to let the team lose."" Al Horford added 19 points for the 76ers, who won their fourth consecutive game. Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson each scored 15. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 22 points for the Nets, who played without Kyrie Irving because of hamstring tightness and lost their fourth straight. Caris LeVert had 16 points and rookie Nicolas Claxton added a career-best 15, but the Nets hurt themselves with 10 turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""Towards the end, we couldn't hold onto the ball. It wasn't anybody in particular, literally everybody was turning it over,"" center Jarrett Allen said. The Nets led 91-82 on Claxton's follow dunk with 1:41 left in the third, but the Sixers scored the final eight points of the period. Simmons got the last six, including two free throws after he was flagrantly fouled by Claxton, who fell hard onto the court. Simmons scored again to open the fourth and give Philadelphia a 92-91 lead, which grew to 97-91 when Raul Neto capped its 15-0 run with a 3-pointer. Philadelphia extended the lead to 105-96 on a basket by Simmons before the Nets scored eight straight while the 76ers went scoreless for nearly five minutes. Horford finally ended that drought when Simmons found him for a 3-pointer and a 108-104 edge with 1:22 to play, and Furkan Korkmaz hit another 3 to put them up five with 23 seconds remaining. The Nets committed 22 turnovers and shot 64.7% on free throws while losing for the 11th time in 13 games. ""I think they ended up having 13 more shots than us, which is not going to work against a really good team,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Claxton is a second-round pick getting extended minutes after backup center DeAndre Jordan suffered a finger injury. Claxton scored 14 points Saturday in a loss to Milwaukee, then went 5 for 5 for 13 points in nine first-half minutes Monday as Brooklyn took a 68-64 lead. TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons averaged 21.3 points, 9.5 rebounds and 7.3 assists last week. The 76ers went 3-1. The Sixers learned of his weekly award during the game. ""I would have given him that just for the second half of this game,"" Brown said. ... Brown said there was no update on Embiid's recovery from surgery on a torn ligament in his left hand. Nets: The Nets got starters Joe Harris and Garrett Temple back from injuries. Harris scored 12 points. ... Allen had 13 points and 13 rebounds, while Taurean Prince had 12 points and 12 boards. AWARD-WINNING SIXERS Richardson won the Eastern Conference award the week before Simmons. That was the first time two different 76ers won the award in back-to-back weeks since Aaron McKie and Iverson did it in 2000-01. Iverson won it consecutively in the 2002-03 season. IRVING UPDATE Irving was feeling soreness Sunday and then was checked again Monday before Brooklyn decided he wouldn't play. Atkinson said the Nets were choosing to be cautious with Irving because they didn't want to risk losing him for the long term.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Evan Fournier has been dealing with an illness and was feeling incredibly sluggish before Orlando's game at Charlotte. So the veteran guard did something he normally doesn't do, slugging down one of those tiny energy shots as he prepared to take the floor. He said it immediately gave him a spark. ""It got me going,"" Fournier said with a wide smile as he held of the bottle. ""I just did it because I'm sick. I'm trying anything right now to give me some energy because otherwise I'm just going to be dead tired."" It seemed to work for Fournier, who scored 26 points in the Magic's 106-83 victory over the sliding Hornets on Monday. ""He was great,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""He's been hurt, he's been sick and he's playing through it. I mean he wasn't good tonight, he was great.""

Fournier and Vucevic each scored 12 in the fourth. ""The second half was one of the best we've played this season,"" Clifford said. Charlotte has gotten most of its scoring this season from Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier, but both guards struggled against the Magic. Graham shot 5 of 17 and had 15 points, while Rozier was held to four points after missing each of his six field goal attempts. Charlotte was held to 38.2% percent shooting from the field and turned the ball over 18 times, leading to 14 points for the Magic. ""They weren't running anything tricky,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""These aren't things that we haven't seen or any surprises with any plays. This is strictly just horrible execution, poor awareness, lack of professionalism coming out of the second quarter."" TIP INS Magic: Clifford cost his team when he challenged a defensive foul call in the third quarter. Officials didn't change the foul call, then ruled the Magic also had goaltended on the foul, creating a three-point play opportunity for Charlotte. Hornets: Both teams wore gray shooting shirts during warmups with the words ""We cannot walk alone,"" in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. ... Graham has made 164 3-pointers through 45 games this season, which leads the Eastern Conference. ROAD TRIP OVER The Magic have been on the road for nearly two weeks. Clifford said he was impressed by his team's focus -- and he's eager to back home. ""That was one of our best wins, because of our approach,"" Clifford said. ""Coming off a poor performance, fly across the country, five o'clock (start), we could have had excuses. But I thought our attitude was great and it set the whole thing up."" Added Vucevic: ""Our defense was great. Our energy was great. Out attitude was great. We just really wanted it and we were able to get a great win against a tough team. "" STRONG FINISHERS The Magic improved to 18-1 this season when leading entering the fourth quarter. ""We got to keep doing it, keep finding a way to play, sticking with it and playing solid defense,"" Ross said. IN SEARCH OF THE RIGHT ROTATION With his team down by 17 points and in need of a spark, Borrego turned to Cody Martin and Bismack Biyombo off the bench. Charlotte cut the lead to seven, but couldn't sustain the momentum in the fourth quarter. Biyombo has gone from starting center to third string behind Cody Zeller and Willy Hernangomez as Borrego continues to shake things up looking to snap the losing streak.","401161284"
"CLEVELAND --  The New York Knicks came out on top in a matchup between teams at the bottom of the standings Monday night. Marcus Morris Sr. and Julius Randle each scored 19 points and New York used a strong second half to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 106-86. Both teams are 12-32 and lead only Atlanta in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks had lost eight of nine. Cleveland, coming off a six-game trip, has lost five in a row and 10 of 12. New York trailed by one at halftime but took over in the third quarter, outscoring Cleveland 30-14. ""We put consecutive stops together early in the third,"" Knicks interim coach Mike Miller said. ""It built some momentum and it spilled over to everything that we did from there."" The Knicks had four losses by more than 20 points in their difficult stretch, including a 121-98 blowout at home to Phoenix last week. ""It's good to see guys make some shots and kind of build confidence,"" Morris said. ""We're trying to go in the right direction."" The Cavaliers, who went 2-4 on the extended trip and blew a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter Saturday in Chicago, looked like a tired team after halftime. The Knicks led 79-64 going into the fourth and pushed the margin to 21 in the final minutes. ""That sounds like an excuse, but I've seen it time and time again where you come and out lay an egg and and it's just slow motion,"" Cavaliers forward Kevin Love. ""That's kind of how we felt tonight."" Cleveland shot a season-low 34% and scored 36 points in the second half, leading coach John Beilein to say his players were gassed following the quick turnaround for Monday's game. ""That is the explanation I can give you right now because we were just not good,"" he said. ""We couldn't make a shot. We missed 62 shots."" Reggie Bullock, Bobby Portis and Damyean Dotson each scored 12 points for New York. Tristan Thompson had a career-high 22 rebounds and 13 points for Cleveland. Collin Sexton scored 17 points, and Cedi Osman had 14. The Knicks scored 11 straight points during a 17-4 run in the third quarter to take a 66-54 lead. Morris hit a 3-pointer and turned his right ankle after coming down on Love's foot. Love was called for a foul, which was upgraded to a flagrant 1 after a review. Morris made the free throw to complete the four-point play. Morris' ankle was heavily taped after the game and he said it was sore. He'll be examined Tuesday. The game was close in the first half, which had seven ties and 10 lead changes. Larry Nance Jr. hit a 3-pointer prior to the buzzer giving Cleveland a 50-49 lead at halftime. The Cavaliers dressed 10 players, including two called up from the G-League, due to injuries and illness. TIP-INS Knicks: G Dennis Smith Jr. (strained left oblique), who missed his 13th straight game, will be re-evaluated later this week. The third-year pro was injured on Dec. 23 against Washington. ... Rookie G RJ Barrett (sprained right ankle) was inactive for the second game in a row. Cavaliers: C John Henson (sore back) and G Brandon Knight (sore left knee) were out. ... C Ante Zizic (illness) missed his fifth straight game. ... F Tyler Cook was signed to a second 10-day contract. ... F Alfonzo McKinnie's 10-day contract expired Sunday. ... G Matt Mooney, signed to a two-way contract last week, scored his first career basket in the fourth quarter. STERN MEMORIAL Miller said the Knicks coaching staff and players plan on attending the Tuesday memorial service for NBA commissioner emeritus David Stern, who passed away Jan. 1 in New York. ""For what he did for the league, it's the least we could do,"" Morris said. PROGRESS REPORT Cavaliers guard Kevin Porter Jr., who sprained his left knee Jan. 5, has begun basketball activities, but there's no timetable for his return. The rookie was injured on a non-contact play while driving to the basket against Minnesota. Porter is averaging 8.5 points in 34 games.","401161285"
"MIAMI --  The Miami Heat never led in the fourth quarter. And they won anyway. Kendrick Nunn scored 25 points, James Johnson added 22 on 9-for-11 shooting and the Heat improved their NBA-best home record to 19-1 by beating the Sacramento Kings 118-113 in overtime on Monday. Goran Dragic scored 18 and Bam Adebayo finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat, who also lead the NBA with a 7-0 overtime record this season. The Heat have already matched last season's home win total -- Miami was 19-22 at home a season ago. ""I keep saying it,"" Adebayo said. ""We've got a lot of grit. We've got a lot of determination. That's the kind of guys who you want in your locker room."" Dragic found Adebayo with a lob that set up a basket with .8 seconds left in regulation, and Adebayo -- a strong All-Star candidate -- scored the first four points of overtime for Miami. The Kings scored the next six to reclaim the lead, before Miami ended the game on a 7-0 run. Sacramento still had a chance to tie the game after a turnover with about a minute left, but Johnson blocked Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3-point try and Nunn sealed the win with a pair of free throws. ""This was one of the more important wins of the season,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Nemanja Bjelica scored 22 points for Sacramento, which is 2-16 in its last 18 trips to Miami. Buddy Hield had 20 points for the Kings, and Marvin Bagley III finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds. ""An unfortunate loss,"" said Kings coach Luke Walton, whose team didn't trail in the final 13:19 of regulation. ""Give Miami credit. They hit a lot of big shots down the stretch and into overtime."" The Kings were 13 of 51 from 3-point range, the most attempts from beyond the arc in franchise history. Miami was without Jimmy Butler, who missed the game with right hip soreness. The Heat played zone defense -- a staple of their game this season -- for long stretches. Sacramento accepted the challenge, taking 25 3-pointers in the first half, 21 in the second half and five in overtime. The 5 p.m. local start meant the Kings didn't have time for a traditional on-court shootaround. Instead, they put tape down on the floor of a ballroom in their hotel and discussed concepts there. ""We talked about how much they like to play zone and that we have to make sure that we don't let that zone get us stagnant,"" Walton said. They went 1 for 13 on 3s in the third quarter and emerged with the lead anyway. A two-point lead at the half was still a two-point lead for Sacramento going into the fourth, 78-76. Sacramento led by as many as eight in the fourth, but couldn't finish. ""This is like the sixth game we had like this, up by two or up by three and lost the game,"" Hield said. ""It's depressing but it's basketball. You have to figure out ways to win."" TIP-INS Kings: This was the second game of a season-long five game road trip for the Kings. ... There was a group of Heat fans from the Bahamas seated behind the Sacramento bench, a tribute to Hield -- a native of the island nation. Also in the crowd: Hield's mom. ""I'm blessed,"" Hield said. Heat: Miami had its run of seven consecutive winning first quarters end, trailing 24-21 after 12 minutes Monday. The last time the Heat had a longer streak of after-one-quarter leads was an 11-game run from Jan. 31 through Feb. 24, 2011. ... Derrick Jones Jr. was lost late in the third quarter after he took an inadvertent poke to both eyes from Sacramento's Cory Joseph. He said postgame that he was feeling better. ... Dragic hosted a group of players from his native Slovenia, who got a postgame arena tour. BUTLER'S HIP Spoelstra said there wasn't a specific incident that caused Butler's hip soreness and didn't sound overly concerned that it would be a lingering issue. ""I think a couple days of treatment will serve him really well,"" Spoelstra said. SHORT-HANDED KINGS Sacramento is still waiting for its trade with Portland to become official, so the Kings were without Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan -- who are about to become Trail Blazers. Kent Bazemore and Anthony Tolliver will be joining Sacramento, likely on Tuesday.","401161286"
"HOUSTON --  After scoring 27 points in the first half against his former team, Chris Paul was on the bench during a big Oklahoma City run in the fourth quarter when a Thunder fan began yelling at coach Billy Donovan to put the veteran guard back in the game. Paul turned to the man and gave him a look that indicated the group on the floor was doing just fine before asking him: ""Do you not see the score?"" Paul scored 28 points and Danilo Gallinari added 25 as the Thunder rallied from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat cold-shooting James Harden and the Houston Rockets 112-107 on Monday. While Paul exulted in what he said might be his team's best win of the season, Harden delayed his postgame shower for some extra work on his shooting after the Rockets lost their season-worst fourth straight. Harden spent about 25 minutes on the court before returning to the locker room, and it was hard to argue he didn't need the practice. The former MVP scored 29 points but went 1 of 17 from 3-point range in an astonishingly inefficient performance. ""Just trying to get back to the basics,"" he said. ""I think when you're struggling you just try to get back to the fundamentals and the basics of your shot and form, form shooting and things like that. Staying with your shot. And just all repetition."" Former Thunder player Russell Westbrook had 32 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds for Houston. Gallinari and Dennis Schroder, who scored 17 of his 23 points after halftime, carried the Thunder after the break. ""It was fun to see how guys stayed together, stayed the course and fought back,"" Paul said. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni was asked what went wrong. ""Couldn't make a shot, didn't make foul shots,"" he said. ""Right now we're at a period where if something is going to go bad, it's bad and when it rains, it pours. And it's pouring."" Oklahoma City used a 6-0 run, highlighted by a dunk from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander after he stole the ball from Harden, to put the Thunder up 108-105 with about a minute left. Harden made a layup for Houston to cut the lead to one, but Schroder made a jump shot with 28 seconds remaining to make it 110-107. Russell Westbrook missed a 3-pointer on the other end and Gilgeous-Alexander added two free throws to secure the victory. ""Dennis and Gallinari offensively, made some really really big shots to get us back in the game,"" Donovan said. ""And then we got some timely stops and some good rebounds. So it really was an amazing job by those guys."" Houston had a 15-point lead before the Thunder scored 13 straight points to get within 100-98 with 4 1/2 minutes to go. Gallinari led the way for Oklahoma City in that stretch, making two 3-pointers and adding three free throws after being fouled on a 3-point attempt. Harden made one of two free throws after that but Gallinari struck again seconds later with another 3 that tied it at 101-all. Gilgeous-Alexander then made one of two free throws to give the Thunder their first lead since the first quarter. Westbrook made Houston's first field goal in more than four minutes with a layup with just more than three minutes left. He then added another layup after a steal seconds later to give the Rockets a 105-102 lead with about two minutes to go. The Thunder trailed by 16 points after three quarters, but a 9-2 run, with five points from Schroder, got them within 91-82 with about 9 1/2 minutes left. Houston trailed by as many as 10 in the first half but led by seven at halftime and used a 9-3 run to open the third quarter and push it to 73-60. P.J. Tucker had a 3-pointer in that stretch and Westbrook added four points. Houston scored the last four points in a third quarter where Oklahoma City scored just 14 points to make it 87-71 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Thunder: Steven Adams sprained his left ankle on a hard foul by Capela early in the first quarter. He missed both free throws after the foul and didn't play after that. Capela was given a flagrant-1. ... Paul received a technical for arguing about a foul call early in the fourth quarter. Rockets: G Austin Rivers missed a second straight game with a right thumb injury. He said he is feeling better and expects to return on Wednesday. ... Westbrook has scored 30 points or more in five straight games. WESTBROOK'S TRIPLE-DOUBLES With his performance on Monday, Westbrook joined LeBron James as the only players to have a triple-double against all 30 current NBA teams. Monday was Westbrook's eighth of the season, 146th of his career and the 42nd time he's had a triple-double in a 30-point game.","401161287"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  After seven games off, a well-rested Jrue Holiday matched his best scoring night of the season and helped New Orleans snap the leagues longest winning streak. Holiday scored 36 points in his return from a left elbow injury as the Pelicans set a franchise record with 21 3-pointers, beating Memphis 126-116 Monday in the Grizzlies' annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration Game. Memphis had won seven straight. Holiday, who hadnt played since Jan. 4, converted 12 of 18 from the field, including 7 of 10 from 3-point range. Brandon Ingram scored 25 points and Nicolo Melli added 15, including a trio of 3-pointers. Load managements crazy, Holiday said with a chuckle about his return. Honestly, it felt good to be back out there. You see how well the teams been doing. Theyve been fighting and playing good teams and beating good teams. ... I just really wanted to be back out there with them. Dillon Brooks led Memphis, matching his season high with 31 points. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 19 points and Ja Morant had 16 points and nine assists. Memphis looked nothing like the team that had won seven in a row. From early in the game, the Pelicans seemed to get to most 50-50 balls. New Orleans was shooting better from the floor and converting 3-pointers. By halftime, the Pelicans had already surpassed their average of 14 3-pointers a game and led 69-50. They played great, and we just didnt have it today. Just timing off and all of that, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Fortunately, we havent had many of these nights. New Orleans built a 25-point lead in the second half before a late rally brought the Grizzlies within 121-116 with 1:28 left. But Ingram scored on a drive and JJ Reddick (10 points) converted a 3-pointer for the final margin. We just kept playing until the buzzer sounded, Morant said. They had some tough baskets late to seal the win. For New Orleans, the return of Holiday was a prelude to Wednesday when Zion Williamson, the top pick in last year's draft, plays his first regular-season game after missing half the season with a right knee injury. The Pelicans have won three of the last four and are 11-5 in their last 16. Its going to be a circus and everyone knows that, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. What we have to do is focus on the task at hand and that is playing a really good San Antonio team. TIP-INS Pelicans: Cs Derrick Favors and Jahlil Okafor (both with low back soreness) sat out. That kept Favors' streak of 19 straight made field goals over the past two games intact. The string is the longest in the NBA this season.  Holidays seven 3-pointers were a career high. He had made six 3s twice previously. Grizzlies: The franchise recognized former athletes Doug Williams, Robert Parish, Sheryl Swoopes and Caron Butler with its 15th annual National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Awards. ... The Grizzlies fell short of the franchise record of eight straight wins, done four previous times. ... It was the first time Memphis has lost this season when Brooks scored 20 points. Memphis was 13-0 in those games. ... Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 11 rebounds, his 21st double-double of the season. NO VOLUNTEERS With centers Favors and Okafor out, Gentry realized in pregame he would be short-handed against Valanciunas, the Grizzlies' bulky 6-foot-11 center. If anybody wants to go in and wrestle with Valanciunas about 15-18 minutes, well let you do that, Gentry said. MORE ZION Asked how Williamson will fit in the Pelicans' rotation, Gentry said: I think hell pretty much play like he did in the preseason. I dont foresee a ton of adjustments. Well stick him out there and play him.","401161288"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks committed 23 turnovers -- and won anyway. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Co. finished strong on Monday. Antetokounmpo had a triple-double and scored his 10,000th career point, and the Bucks beat the Chicago Bulls 111-98 to sweep the four-game season series. Antetokounmpo had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his fourth triple-double of the season. He reached 10,000 points on a jump hook with 4:30 remaining in the fourth. But the reigning NBA MVP also committed eight turnovers. The Bulls scored 24 points off Milwaukee's miscues. Antetokounmpo said he thinks a trip to Paris this week, as well as the rare late afternoon, weekday start, may have played a part in the team's sloppy play. ""A game like this, it's kind of a tricky game,"" he said. ""We're about to leave to go to Paris, we've got to take care of our family here, make sure everything's right. You've got to make sure you pack your bags, all that other stuff. It takes away from the game."" Antetokounmpo shrugged off the turnovers to help the Bucks pull away late. ""Having turnovers doesn't slow me down. I want to keep being aggressive,"" he said. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer credited the Bulls' aggressive defensive scheme. ""Chicago makes it hard on you,"" he said. ""They force a lot of turnovers, they're active defensively."" Khris Middleton added 24 points for Milwaukee, which has won 10 consecutive games over the Bulls dating to the 2017-18 season. It's the Bucks' longest winning streak over Chicago since the teams began playing in 1968. The Bucks ran their league-best record to 39-6 with their seventh straight victory. Milwaukee shot 58%, with Middleton connecting on 10 of 13 shots. Zach LaVine had 24 points for Chicago, which shot just 37%. Kris Dunn scored 15 points, and reserve Thaddeus Young added 14 points. LaVine has scored at least 20 points in 11 consecutive games. ""We just kept fighting and scrapping,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""If we have a normal shooting night from the 3, it's a different outcome."" After a sloppy first half by both teams, the Bucks began to take control, opening the third quarter on a 13-4 run, sparked by Middleton's eight points. Milwaukee's lead grew to as many as 16 in the quarter before Chicago clawed back. TIP-INS Bulls: Two-way player Adam Mokoka returned to the team and was active but did not play. ... After being outscored 14-0 by Bucks reserves in first quarter, Chicago's bench outscored Milwaukee's 16-6 in the second. ... Boylen was whistled for a technical foul as the teams left the court at halftime. ... Young had a season-high four 3-pointers. Bucks: Robin Lopez sat out a second consecutive game due to an undisclosed illness. Lopez will not accompany the team on the trip to Paris. ""It makes sense for Robin to stay and try and get healthy,"" Budenholzer said. ... With Lopez out, Budenholzer turned to Dragan Bender, who has played mostly with the team's G-League affiliate this season, to be the first big man off the bench. ... Milwaukee scored 100 or more points for the 69th straight game, dating to last February. ... Had 15 first-half turnovers. FRENCH CONNECTION The Bucks take on the Hornets in Paris on Friday. ""I think we can go over there in a good mindset. I think the whole group, including myself, are excited about experiencing Paris and a little bit of French culture and just the people and the excitement for the NBA game and our team,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think there's a really healthy outlook on spending three or four days together as a team, all those bonding opportunities, whether it be meals or walking the streets and seeing different things."" MARKKANEN MISSES Boylen said he remains confident in Lauri Markkanen despite his ongoing shooting struggles. The 7-foot Markkanen went 0 for 7 from 3-point range against the Bucks. ""I know he's going to work. He cares and he has high character,"" Boylen said. ""I believe in him and our team believes in him."" Markkanen shot 2 for 11 overall. ""I've had long stretches where I didn't make shots. I'm not worried about that,"" Markkanen said.","401161289"
"BOSTON --  Kemba Walker finally beat LeBron James, and he did it by helping the Boston Celtics send the Los Angeles Lakers to their biggest loss of the season. Walker ended a career-long losing streak against James, scoring 20 points to beat him for the first time in 29 tries and lead the Celtics past the rival Lakers 139-107 on Monday night. ""I'm happy I got one at least, before he goes,"" Walker said with a laugh after the Celtics snapped their three-game losing streak. ""Who knows how long he can play, because he's just incredible. But you know, it's only one. One and 28."" Jaylen Brown scored 20 points, drawing a taunting technical after dunking over James, and Enes Kanter had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Boston. The Celtics gave up the first eight points of the game but turned things around when Anthony Davis, playing for the first time in almost two weeks, went to the bench with a pair of fouls 49 seconds apart early in the first quarter. ""The less he plays, the better for everybody else,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. James had 15 points and 13 assists for the Lakers, who had won 10 of their previous 11 games. But the Celtics made 13 of their first 22 3-point attempts to open a 103-75 lead in the third quarter -- the biggest against Los Angeles all season until Boston made it a 34-point game in the fourth. ""We were fortunate to put the ball in the basket quite a bit,"" said Stevens, whose team shot 56% overall. ""The ball going in masks some things."" Walker's 28 games with out a win against James was second in NBA history only to Sherman Douglas' 0-30 head-to-head record against Michael Jordan. ""If anybody: him. The guy I couldn't beat, it'd be him. He's such a great player, he's done so much in this league,"" said Walker, who spent the first eight years of his career in Charlotte. ""He's beaten a lot of guys. I bet you there's a lot of people who don't have a winning record against LeBron James."" POSTER Brown was called for a technical foul after he hung on the rim with one arm and taunted James after dunking over him in the second quarter. ""I ain't going to lie, that was pretty nice, pretty awesome,"" Brown said. ""LeBron, he's gotten so many other guys. Just to be out there against one of the best players to ever play the game is an honor. I always like like that matchup and it gives me a little extra boost."" James said there was no shame in getting beaten -- this time. ""Why would I take it personally? It's part of basketball,"" he said. ""It's not the first time I got dunked on. It might not be the last time I get dunked on. But Jaylen's been playing exceptionally well this year. It was a good play."" MINUTES RESTRICTED Davis was only expected to play 28 minutes in his first game after missing five in a row since he landed hard on his back against the Knicks on Jan. 7. Coach Frank Vogel said he would limit Davis to 28 minutes, but he pulled Davis when he picked up two fouls in the first four minutes. He did not return the rest of the quarter, as the Celtics turned a six-point deficit into a three-point lead. They built on it in the second, when Tatum scored 13 points and Kanter had 12 to give Boston a 69-55 lead at the break. Davis finished with nine points and four rebounds in 23 minutes. ""I was just trying to get back into game shape and get back in rhythm,"" Davis said. ""For the most part, I felt fine."" STAR-STUDDED The Lakers' only visit to Boston this season brought out a few celebrities, including rapper Snoop Dogg, former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz and a handful of members of the New England Patriots. James took advantage of the trip to Boston to take in a high school game his son Bronny was playing in Springfield. The Lakers star reportedly made the 90-mile commute across the state in a helicopter. ""My routine was broken today, but I could care less about it if I was seeing my family,"" he said. ""It was a unique opportunity to see my son, live, play that close to where I'm at. So I could care less about all that. It's all secondary when it comes to my family."" TIP-INS Lakers: The 69 first-half points were the most scored against LA this season. ... The Celtics posted pictures outside the Lakers locker room of Rajon Rondo and Avery Bradley from their Boston days, along with one of Vogel, who started in Boston as a video coordinator. ... The Lakers' biggest defeat of the season had been a 128-104 loss to Denver on Dec. 22. That was also the most points they had given up before Monday. Celtics: Tatum scored eight points during a 16-2 run that left Boston leading 97-68 with about four minutes left in the third and brought out the first ""Beat LA!"" chant of the night. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Hit hard recently by injuries, the Denver Nuggets have managed to remain on track in the top-heavy Western Conference race. Michael Porter Jr. has been one of the main reasons. Porter posted his second double-double in three games with 20 points and 14 rebounds, helping the short-handed Nuggets overtake the Minnesota Timberwolves 107-100 on Monday night. ""He's impacting the game at such a high level. He's growing up in front of our eyes,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. Jerami Grant scored 19 points and Nikola Jokic had 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Nuggets, who again had three of their top five scorers absent -- Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap and Gary Harris Jr. -- and were playing on back-to-back nights. Porter, the 2018 first-round draft pick whose rookie season was ruined by a back injury, was a major factor in the victory. ""He's an amazing talent. You see how his ball is going into the hoop. It's a swoosh every time,"" Jokic said. The 6-foot-10 Porter went 7 for 12 from the floor for the second 20-point game of his budding career, having just begun to get regular playing time within the last three weeks. ""Just helping the team win, not going out there and thinking about me,"" said Porter, who keyed a 19-5 spurt late in the second quarter with nine points and five rebounds after the Nuggets fell behind 46-36 for their largest deficit of the night. Karl-Anthony Towns outplayed his rival Jokic with 28 points and eight rebounds and reserve Josh Okogie added 16 points, but Minnesota dropped its sixth straight game. The Timberwolves surrendered 50 points in the paint and were outrebounded 40-31. ""We've got to have that fight. We've got to go get that ball. It's all of us,"" Towns said. The Nuggets had that toughness, coming up with just enough second-chance opportunities down the stretch to demoralize a struggling opponent. ""It's like building a sandcastle at the ocean, and then it just gets wiped away, and then you've got to start it all over,"" Towns said. The Wolves were mostly within one possession in the second half, cutting their deficit to 88-85 with 8:33 left on a dunk by Keita Bates-Diop over the top of Jokic, But Porter responded with a 3-pointer soon after to double the lead. Malik Beasley, who had 11 points off the bench, helped the Nuggets create some more space. Towns had a three-point play with 2:48 remaining that brought the Wolves within 102-98, but they couldn't get enough stops when it counted the most. Monte Morris popped out to swish a mid-range shot from the wing for Denver on the next possession. Okogie snagged a give-and-go pass from Robert Covington for a dunk that cut the lead to four points again, and Towns had the ball in the post after Jokic missed a 3-pointer, but he couldn't get the ball to fall in a crowd around the basket that had Towns complaining about no foul call. Then Will Barton III, who had 18 points, sealed the deal with a 3-pointer on the other end. ""This was just a character win, man. I couldn't be more proud of the group,"" Malone said.

"PHOENIX --  Bryn Forbes lived a shooter's dream during the first half on Monday night, making seven 3-pointers as the San Antonio Spurs built a big early lead. The second half wasn't nearly as fun. But Forbes made one more from long distance and it was huge for the Spurs, who coughed up a 20-point cushion before rallying in the final minutes for a 120-118 win over the Phoenix Suns. Forbes' eighth 3-pointer with 2:33 remaining put the Spurs up 114-113, providing a pivotal morale boost right after they had lost the lead for the first time all night. San Antonio didn't trail again and won for the fifth time in eight games. ""It felt good, man. It felt good to see a big shot go down,"" Forbes said. ""I think my teammates did a great job finding me, slashing and kicking. Just keep shooting. It should be the same mentality always -- ups, downs, keep shooting."" Derrick White scored a season-high 25 points and Forbes added 24, all on 3s. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 19 and DeMar DeRozan added 18. San Antonio led 78-58 midway through the third quarter and 96-83 going into the fourth, but Phoenix chipped away. Suns center Deandre Ayton made two free throws with 3:55 left that tied it 108-all and capped 15-0 run. Ricky Rubio hit a layup while drawing a foul, adding the free throw to push the Suns ahead for the first time at 113-111 with 2:55 left. ""The guys in our group fight until the end and I'm proud of that,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""That's a DNA that we're about every day."" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich wasn't surprised by the Suns' rally in the second half. He also wasn't surprised his team was able to recover. ""It's called basketball, it's the NBA and it happens all the time,"" Popovich said. The Suns trailed 119-117 with 6.4 seconds left and Rubio had a chance to tie the game with two free throws, but missed the first attempt before making the second. Aldridge responded by making one of two free throws to leave the Spurs up 120-118 with 5.6 seconds left. That set up a dramatic final possession, and Devin Booker missed a long 3 with about two seconds left that would have won it. Booker led the Suns with 37 points. He had 22 during the third quarter in a nearly single-handed effort to keep Phoenix close, but his final look wasn't particularly clean. He was forced far beyond the 3-point line and shot it from about 35 feet. ""I think the whole world knew it was going to Booker,"" White said. ""He was killing it the whole night. Just tried to make it tough and contested."" Forbes was 7 of 8 from 3-point range in the first half and made six in the second quarter. The 6-foot-3 guard peeled around a screen in the final seconds of the period, making his seventh 3 over the outstretched arm of Kelly Oubre Jr. to give the Spurs a 66-51 halftime lead. The Suns climbed out of that hole, but couldn't get the win. ""The margin for error is zero, simple as that,"" Oubre said. ""We have to put ourselves in a different mind-frame than where we're at. We have to think bigger picture, think of the next play, think of putting our brother before ourselves."" San Antonio made 12 of 20 shots (60%) from 3-point territory in the first half. Dario Saric and Ayton both scored 10 points for the Suns before the break. Ayton finished with 25 points and 12 rebounds for his fourth straight game of at least 20 points and 10 boards. TIP-INS Spurs: DeMarre Carroll and Rudy Gay both missed the game because of illness. ... The Spurs shot 17 of 31 (55%) from 3-point range. Suns: Oubre was back in the starting lineup after missing two games while in concussion protocol. ... F Aron Baynes (left hip soreness) and G Cameron Johnson (bruised right quad) were also out. ... It was the first time since opening night that Rubio, Booker, Oubre, Saric and Ayton started in the same game. ... The Suns are one win from 19, which would match last season's total. ... Booker played the entire second half.","401161292"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  When the Utah Jazz find a rhythm around the basket, few teams can do anything to stop them from dominating on both ends of the court. That certainly was the case during a 118-88 victory Monday night over the Indiana Pacers. For the bulk of 48 minutes, Utah attacked the rim with relentless energy. The Jazz crashed the boards, didn't trail at all and were never seriously threatened. Utah shot 54% from the field, scored 60 points in the paint and finished with a 53-30 advantage in rebounds. The Jazz also limited Indiana to seven free throw attempts, and the Pacers made just three. Both were season lows for a Utah opponent. ""That was really what we wanted to do,"" center Rudy Gobert said. ""Don't give them any free throws. Don't give them anything at the rim and don't give them any rebounds. I think we did a great job doing those three."" Donovan Mitchell scored 25 points and Gobert had 20 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Jazz. Bojan Bogdanovic added 16 points and Mike Conley had 14 off the bench. Myles Turner and Aaron Holiday scored 12 points apiece to lead Indiana. Turner added a career-high six steals, but the Pacers lost despite forcing 21 turnovers and nabbing a season-best 15 steals. ""We didn't convert,"" Turner said. ""You force a team to have 20 turnovers, you've got to find some way to convert somehow, some way, and that definitely hurt us."" Utah went to the basket throughout the first quarter and it paid off. The Jazz scored 20 points in the paint out of 29 total points in the quarter. ""They were the aggressors on both sides of the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""When they did shoot the ball and miss, they got the rebounds."" That allowed Utah to take control early. Joe Ingles drained a 3-pointer and then set up baskets for Gobert on back-to-back possessions to spark a 12-4 run that gave the Jazz an 18-10 lead midway through the first period. Indiana closed to 31-27 on a hook shot from Domantas Sabonis early in the second, but Utah did not let the Pacers get any closer before halftime. Conley fed Gobert for a dunk and followed with consecutive baskets to cap an 18-5 run that gave the Jazz a 49-32 lead midway through the quarter. ""When you are consistent defensively, you give yourself a chance for good things to happen,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Utah maintained a double-digit cushion throughout the third and went up 78-55 on a jumper from Conley. The Jazz never slacked off once they took control, something that didn't always happen earlier in the season. ""We're just enjoying it,"" Mitchell said. ""A lot of it is we're playing off instinct. At beginning of the year, when you have new guys, we tended to overthink trying to figure each other out. We know what plays to run each other. We know where everybody is going to be."" VINTAGE CONLEY After missing 19 games with a hamstring injury, Conley appears to be back to his old self. The Jazz guard scored 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting in 18 minutes off the bench. The veteran gave a sign of things to come when he dunked the ball in pregame warmups. ""I've never seen a 60-year-old dunk before. It's crazy,"" Mitchell joked. For his part, Conley is quickly finding a groove on the floor again after being absent for so long. It is a satisfying development after he struggled to get comfortable in the offense early this season. ""I've been feeling really good for a while, so I just missed being on the court,"" Conley said. ""The coaching staff and players are making it easy on me and it is easy basketball with those guys."" LOW POINT The Pacers endured their most lopsided loss of the season, eclipsing a 28-point defeat at Milwaukee on Dec. 22. ""In a game like this, you just learn from it and then you flush it and move on to the next game whether you played good or not,"" guard Jeremy Lamb said. TIP-INS Pacers: Justin Holiday had a career-high five blocks. ... T.J. McConnell led the Pacers with 10 assists. ... Indiana scored exactly 121 points in each of its previous three games against Utah. Jazz: Bogdanovic shot and made the first free throw of the game with 6:54 left in the second quarter. ... Ingles finished with a team-high seven assists. . Utah scored 25 points off 14 Indiana turnovers. . The Jazz outscored the Pacers 22-4 in second-chance points.","401161293"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  After setting a Portland record with 61 points, Damian Lillard knew exactly who held the old mark. He did. Lillard topped his own franchise scoring high Monday night in the Trail Blazers' 129-124 overtime victory against the Golden State Warriors. He also established a team best with 11 3-pointers. ""I guess if somebody's going to beat my record, it's good to be me,"" Lillard said. The star guard's previous career high was 60 points earlier this season against Brooklyn, which broke the club record at the time. His 61 points Monday were the most in the NBA this season. Lillard became the first player in NBA history with 60-plus points and 10-plus 3-pointers in a game, and just the sixth player with multiple 60-point games. He also had 10 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season, and he made all 16 of his free throws. Hassan Whiteside added 17 points and 21 rebounds for the Blazers (19-26), who snapped a two-game skid. ""I'm excited about it, I'm happy about it, but I wish it counted for three wins instead of one,"" Lillard said. The Blazers trailed by 12 in the third quarter but clawed back in the fourth. Lillard's layup and free throw gave Portland a 110-109 lead with 2:26 left, but rookie Eric Paschall dunked to put Golden State back in front with less than a minute to go. Alec Burks added a pair of free throws to extend Golden State's lead, but Lillard's 3-pointer tied it with 14.9 seconds left and the game went to overtime. Willie Cauley-Stein's dunk put the Warriors up 121-115 in the extra period. Anfernee Simons hit a 3 to pull Portland closer before Lillard's 3-pointer with less than a minute left tied it again. Gary Trent Jr.'s layup gave Portland the lead with 34.6 seconds to go. Burks' 3-pointer briefly gave the Warriors back the lead, but Lillard and Whiteside each added a pair of free throws to seal it. The crowd stood and cheered as Lillard made the free throw that gave him the record. Lillard said he knew he had 59 points when he was fouled. ""The guy bumped me and I was like, `I'm going down.' They're going to have to blow this whistle and I'm getting these two free throws. And that was it,"" he said. Blazers coach Terry Stotts said Lillard carried the team, not only on the court but in huddles, timeouts and at halftime. ""You run out of adjectives,"" Stotts said. ""He's an amazing player."" Burks finished with a season-high 33 points, and Paschall added 22 points and 13 rebounds. ""He's a great player,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said about Lillard. ""He's an All-Star that's had a million big shots in his career, so none of it was surprising. You just take it for granted with him."" Both teams were drastically limited, personnel-wise. The Warriors (10-35), hit hard by injuries this season, essentially had eight available players. Draymond Green suited up but Kerr said before the game it was unlikely Green would play because he wasn't feeling well. Glenn Robinson III remained out because of an an ankle injury. Kerr said he hoped to have Kevon Looney (abdominal soreness) back later this week. The Warriors started D'Angelo Russell, Damion Lee, Burks, Cauley-Stein and Paschall for the second straight game. The Blazers, who had just nine players available, were without CJ McCollum for the second straight game because of a sprained left ankle. Simons started in his place. Portland was also without Kent Bazemore and Anthony Tolliver, who are set to be traded along with draft picks to the Sacramento Kings for Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan. But the deal hasn't been finalized, meaning the already injury-hampered Blazers were further depleted. Golden State led 57-53 at halftime as the Blazers struggled from 3-point range in the opening half, making just two of 15 attempts. Paschall's dunk and jumper gave Golden State a 77-65 lead midway through the third quarter and the Warriors held a 92-87 lead going into the fourth. They were able to stay in front until Lillard's 3-pointer put Portland up 103-102 with 6:53 left. The Warriors were coming off a 109-95 victory over the Orlando Magic that snapped a 10-game losing streak and a five-game slide at home. TIP-INS Warriors: Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry were in Pullman, Washington, over the weekend when Washington State retired Thompson's No. 1 jersey. Thompson's return this season is uncertain while he rehabs from the ACL injury he sustained in the NBA Finals. Curry has a broken left hand but there's speculation he could return following the All-Star break. Curry was at the game in Portland. Trail Blazers: Low on available players, the Blazers transferred Moses Brown to Portland from the Texas Legends on Sunday. ... It was the first of a four-game homestand for Portland. ... Lillard is the second NBA player with multiple 50-point games this season, joining Houston star James Harden. ... Lillard joined Elgin Baylor (63 points on Dec. 8, 1961) and Wilt Chamberlain (62 points on March 3, 1966) as the only players to score 60 against the Warriors. ZEN DAME Whiteside was asked what impresses him most about Lillard. ""Just how cool and how calm he is,"" Whiteside replied. ""He is always a calm guy, regardless of whatever happens.""","401161294"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks brought back one big man but lost another Tuesday night, and in the end, they couldn't rein in the reigning Finals MVP. Kawhi Leonard scored 36 points, Landry Shamet hit two clutch 3-pointers late and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Dallas Mavericks 110-107 Tuesday night for their fourth straight win. Dallas ended a four-game winning streak, and more importantly, lost a key piece in center Dwight Powell just as they welcomed back Kristaps Porzingis. Powell went down to a non-contact, right Achilles tendon injury in the first quarter, and though he will have an MRI on Wednesday, the team is fearing a worst-case scenario. ""Guys like him define the culture we want here,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It doesn't get much tougher than this, if it ends up being what we fear it might."" Luka Doncic had 36 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for Dallas. He scored 24 points in the second half to help rally the Mavericks after they trailed by double digits from late in the second quarter through most of the third. Shamet helped the Clippers seize the game late in the fourth quarter. His 3 from the left wing to give Los Angeles a 100-98 lead with 2:48 to play. Montrezl Harrell added two free throws, then Shamet sank another 3 from straight-on to put the Clippers up by seven. He finished with 18 points. ""We just kind of found a way to win,"" Shamet said. ""We'd loved to keep that lead the whole game, but that's not how it's going to be. It's a long season. We got to find different ways how to win like we did tonight."" Leonard added 11 in the fourth quarter, including his only 3 of the game with 1:15 left, which put the Clippers up 108-100. But Dallas rallied, as Doncic hit a 3 and Maxi Kleber a dunk. After a Clippers turnover, Tim Hardaway Jr.'s potential tying 3 spun around and out. JaMychal Green missed two free throws for LA, but then Doncic missed two -- the second intentionally -- and Leonard sealed it with two free throws. POWELL'S INJURY Powell went down when he started to drive toward the basket but his right leg gave out. He fell to the ground and immediately slapped the floor in pain. He was helped to the locker room putting no weight on his right leg. Powell's teammate J.J. Barea -- who tore his right Achilles tendon last season -- was distraught as Powell was taken off the court. Powell was averaging nearly 10 points a game in 39 games prior to the injury. With Porzingis out, Powell averaged 13 points over 10 games on 71% shooting. With Powell out, Dallas got 16 valuable minutes from former Clipper Boban Marjanovic, who had 12 points and seven rebounds. His turnaround hook with 6:23 to play tied it at 90, capping a rally from a 14-point, second-half deficit. KP RETURNS Porzingis scored 10 points on 4-for-17 shooting in his return after missing 10 games with right knee soreness. He added nine rebounds, but after the game, he blamed himself for the Mavericks' loss. ""If I played just a little bit better, we would have won the game,"" Porzingis said. ""This loss is on me. That's how I feel. I know it's my first game back but I have high expectations for myself and I'm disappointed I wasn't able to shoot the ball better."" LEONARD STEPS UP With teammate Paul George out over the last six games, Leonard has averaged 36 and at least 30 in every game. ""We've been watching film together, seeing what mistakes we've been making,"" Leonard said. ""So everybody's just giving the effort of their mind and body, wanting to compete, make winning plays and just be a better basketball team."" TIP-INS Clippers: George missed his sixth straight game with a left hamstring strain. ... G Patrick Beverley left in the second quarter with a groin injury and did not return. ... F Maurice Harkless returned after missing one game with a sore back. Mavericks: The Clippers also ended a five-game Mavericks winning streak on Nov. 26.","401161295"
"DETROIT --  One Detroit point guard has been carrying the scoring load. Another joined him Wednesday night, with his back now healthy enough to pitch in. Derrick Rose scored 22 points and Reggie Jackson also had 22 in his return to lineup as the Pistons beat Sacramento 127-106 to hand the Kings their sixth straight loss. Jackson had missed 42 games since leaving the second game of the season with a back injury. He said after this one the stress reaction in his lower back had affected his sleeping but credited the training staff with getting him back on the court. Teammates being lenient with me and just being put in a good position. I think all that combined and a little bit of luck, of course,"" Jackson said. ""All that combined allowed myself to just flow pretty easily. Jackson made a floater on his first attempt and played well in his 19 minutes off the bench, shooting 8 of 14 and handling out four assists. He gives us two big-time point guard on the floor, Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. When you alternate those guys, you have stability at the point guard position, and thats what this league is all about, guys that can create and run the floor. Rose scored 20 or more points for the 10th straight game, tying the career high he set in 2010-11, his MVP season in Chicago. He also eclipsed 11,000 career points and added 11 assists. Christian Wood scored 23 points, and Svi Mykhailiuk added 13 points, the 11th time in 12 games that he has scored in double figures. DeAaron Fox had 22 points, and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 19 points for the Kings, who shot 12 of 23 from the line (52.2%). This was as frustrating as it gets, Kings coach Luke Walton said. Basketball is a simple game: Defend without fouling, make the right play and knock down shots early. I feel like we didnt do any of those things. The Pistons took a 57-50 lead into halftime, and stretched the lead to 93-75 as Jackson beat the third-quarter buzzer with a 3-pointer for Detroits largest lead at the time. The Pistons led by double digits throughout the fourth, and Sacramento shot 10 for 35 (28.6%) on 3-pointers on the night. I think our bad stretches have been happening for too long, too many times, Fox said. You just try to play the best basketball you can for the most amount of time. I dont think were doing that right now. Both teams were without their starting post players because of injuries. Sacramento was missing Marvin Bagley III (foot) and Richaun Holmes (shoulder), while Detroit was without Andre Drummond (lip) and Blake Griffin (knee), who is likely out for the season. TIP-INS Sacramento: With Bagley and Holmes out, Dewayne Dedmon started for the fifth time this season and first since Oct. 28, the seasons fourth game. He played 31 minutes and had 13 points and 10 rebounds, tying his season-high for rebounds in his second double-double of the year. Detroit: Without league leader Drummond, the Pistons earned a 50-44 rebounding edge. Thon Maker tied his career high with his ninth rebound less than a minute into the second half. He finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds for his first career double-double. Markieff Morris grabbed a season-high 11 rebounds. NEW GUYS Kent Bazemore made his Kings debut after being traded from Portland in a five-player deal on Tuesday that also netted Sacramento Anthony Tolliver. Bazemore scored seven points. Tolliver went scoreless in six minutes. Tolliver played in Sacremento in 2016-17, the 13th NBA stop of his 12th season. Hes also made two stops apiece in Detroit, Portland and Minnesota. BACK TO THE BENCH Bagley missed eight games with an injured foot suffered on Dec. 26 and returned to action Jan. 13, but was sore after Mondays loss at Miami, Walton said. Its nothing major, just being cautious with it, Walton said. We were hopeful we were past that but you know its something that well be safe and smart about it, and then take it day to day and hopefully have them back soon. The second-year player from Duke has also suffered a broken thumb this season and has played 13 games. ROOKIE MISTAKE After 10 straight starts, Pistons rookie Sekou Doumbouya game off the bench Wednesday, scoring four points. Casey said after the game that Doumbouya was late for morning shoot around.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Oklahoma City Thunder's three-guard offense was too much for the Orlando Magic. Dennis Schroder scored 31 points and the Thunder shot 60.5% against one of the NBA's better defenses Wednesday night in a 120-114 victory over the Magic. ""We've got three point guards who can make decisions and who are dangerous,"" said Schroder, who came off the bench with 13-for-18 shooting and added nine assists. ""Every time we have that lineup, it opens up a lot, whoever's got the ball. I was just aggressive, shooting with confidence, and it went in."" Chris Paul added 19 points and six assists, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which won for the eighth time in nine road games. Terrence Ross scored 26 points and Nikola Vucevic added 24 points and 11 rebounds for Orlando, which had allowed an NBA-low 103.9 points per game. Oklahoma City's 60.5% (46 of 76) shooting was a season-high against the Magic. ""We aren't bad ourselves,"" Paul said. ""I've seen every coverage you can see. We came in yesterday and got a good practice in and tonight we came out with the right energy."" The Thunder led by as many as 14 points during the first half in which they shot 63.4%. ""If we defend like that, it's going to be a long season,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We got crushed on the ball, we got crushed on pick and rolls and our interior players at the rim were late all night. With the game on the line, we fouled and fouled and fouled. You have to play with both intensity and purpose and we had neither."" Nerlens Noel dunked twice during a 14-2 run early in the third quarter to help the Thunder take a 15-point lead, but Ross finished the period with a big scoring burst, rallying Orlando and tying the game at 89-89. Ross converted a four-point play while scoring 12 points in the final 2:09 of the quarter, then opened the fourth with a steal and a layup. After the Thunder went 3:46 without scoring, Aaron Gordon missed two fee throws that could have put the Magic ahead with 3:49 left in the game. Schroder and Paul scored the next 10 points for the Thunder and put the game away. TIP-INS Thunder: C Steven Adams, injured in the first quarter of Monday night's game at Houston, did not play after testing his left ankle before the game. ...

"ATLANTA --  With Trae Young cheering him on from the bench, two-way player Brandon Goodwin did a pretty good impression of the Atlanta Hawks' star. Goodwin scored 19 points -- all in the fourth quarter -- and the Hawks rallied from a 21-point deficit to stun the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers 102-95 on Wednesday night. John Collins scored 33 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, but it was Goodwin who took control in the final period. He made 6 of 11 shots, including all three attempts beyond the arc, and dished off to De'Andre Hunter in the corner for a 3-pointer that gave the Hawks a 99-93 lead with 1:43 remaining. ""Obviously, when I first got in there, I wasn't doing much,"" Goodwin said. ""When that first 3 fell, I was kind of relieved. I started to hit my shots."" Young, the NBA's third-leading scorer at 29.2 points a game, didn't dress because of a right thigh contusion. Recently acquired Jeff Teague started in his place, but the Hawks turned to a guy who has spent a good portion of the season in the G League with the game on the line. ""He controlled the offense and made big plays,"" Collins said. ""To give us the minutes he did was extremely valuable."" The Clippers seemingly seized control with a 20-0 run in the first quarter, despite missing starters Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Patrick Beverly. Los Angeles went with a lineup that was averaging a cumulative 44.5 points a game. They had no trouble scoring in the first half against the Hawks' 28th-ranked defense, building a 60-41 at the break. But the Clippers were dismal offensively in the second half, hitting just 12 of 37 (32.4%) from the field, including 2 of 15 from 3-point range. `A rough start,"" Collins said. ""But they didn't have a couple of their big guns. We knew we could play with them."" Clippers coach Doc Rivers felt his team squandered a chance to build an even bigger lead in the final minutes of the first half. Then, in the first five minutes of the third quarter, Los Angeles let the Hawks back in the game. ""Once it became a 10-point game, you're like, `Oh boy, it's going to be a tough night,"" Rivers said. Montrezl Harrell led Los Angeles with 30 points, but his struggles at the foul line (6 of 13) gave the Hawks a chance to rally. Rivers didn't seem too concerned about the loss, which snapped a four-game winning streak. ""A one-off-game,"" he called it. Leonard skipped the back-to-back after a 36-point effort the previous night in a victory at Dallas. Beverly missed the game after going down out with a groin injury against the Mavericks. George missed his seventh straight game recovering from a strained left hamstring. With many fans still settling into their seats, the Clippers suddenly turned a 12-10 deficit into a 30-12 lead. The Hawks missed 15 straight shots during a nearly six-minute scoring drought, despite giving themselves plenty of second chances by grabbing five offensive rebounds. The Hawks rallied with a barrage of 3-pointers, hitting 10 of 23 over the final two quarters after going 1 of 12 in the first half. They were essentially a two-man team in the final period. Goodwin and Collins combined for 27 of the team's 33 points. TEAGUE STARTS Recently acquired Jeff Teague made his first start for the Hawks since May 8, 2016, when Atlanta lost at Cleveland to complete a four-game sweep in the second round of the playoffs. He returned to the Hawks last week in a trade with Minnesota, mainly to serve mainly as the backup point guard. With Young out, he moved into the starting lineup, rekindling memories of his starring role on the 2014-15 team that won 60 games and reached the Eastern Conference final. Teague managed just 3 points on 1 of 7 shooting, though he did lead the team with eight assists. TIP-INS Clippers: Lou Williams and Terance Mann started in the Clippers backcourt. Williams scored 18 points, but Mann contributed just two assists and a single point in 15 1/2 minutes of playing time. ... Landry Chamet committed a dismal foul on Goodwin in the closing minutes, slamming into the Atlanta player after he misfired on a 3-pointer. Goodwin made all three free throws to give the Hawks a 96-91 lead. Hawks: Bruno Fernando started at center, scoring six points and grabbing nine rebounds. ... Kevin Huerter (12 points) and Cam Reddish (10) were also in double figures for Atlanta. ...

He did it again to help key Boston's rout of one of the league's hottest teams. Tatum scored 23 points before leaving the game in the third quarter with a groin injury as the Celtics ran past the Memphis Grizzlies 119-95 on Wednesday night. Daniel Theis had 14 points, and Enes Kanter finished with 13 points and eight rebounds to help Boston win its second straight. Memphis has lost two in a row since posting a season-high, seven-game win streak. It was the Celtics' eighth straight win over the Grizzlies. I thought our guys really dug in on the defensive end of the floor,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Then (Tatum) scored a bunch of buckets there in a row and pushed it out. Our other guys were struggling to get any real rhythm offensively. He kind of got us going. Then in the third quarter every one of those guys picked up where he left off. Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Solomon Hill each added 13 points. That's what their known for. We should have matched it better,"" Jackson said. ""They did some things differently. Credit to them for playing hard and playing feisty. Tatum limped to the locker room with a right groin strain with 4:43 left in the third. He returned to the bench at the start of fourth quarter with his right leg wrapped, but was still noticeably in pain and did not return. But Boston didn't need him, using an 22-3 run -- capped by a 3-pointer by Gordon Hayward -- to increase their 12-point halftime lead to 87-54. Kemba Walker, Hayward and Marcus Smart scored 18 of Boston's first 20 points in the period. Boston was 6 of 7 from the 3-point line. It was the worst third quarter of the season for Memphis, which was outscored by 22 points. The Celtics' lead grew as high as 38 points in the fourth. I think we got a lot of deflections, we were active defensively and we were in the right spots,"" Hayward said. ""Because of that, we were able to run, and then we got out and got some easy ones. Stevens said Tatum would be checked out further, but doesn't think the injury is significant. Boston missed 13 of its first 17 field goal attempts, including going 1 of 8 from the 3-point line. Walker, Hayward and Smart scored just six points between them in the first half, combining to go just 1 of 16 from the field. It helped Memphis, which had the highest scoring offense last month (118.7 per game since Dec. 9), to take a 42-35 lead in the second quarter. But Boston got its footing and used a 23-0 run to take a 58-42 advantage. The Grizzlies went scoreless for 6:51 until Valanciunas scored with just 1.3 seconds left before halftime. TIP-INS Grizzlies: F Bruno Caboclo missed his third straight game with left knee soreness. Celtics: F Jaylen Brown sat out with a sprained right ankle. ... Tatum has scored in double figures for 33 consecutive games. SHARING THE BALL Boston finished with 32 assists on 44 made field goals. The Celtics had 31 assists in their 32-point win over the Lakers on Monday. You can feel the last two games the way the ball's whipping around. That's who we have to be, Stevens said. I've been really encouraged by that the last two games. INJURY UPDATE Celtics big man Robert Williams (left hip bone edema) was able to do some light running Tuesday. Celtics coach Stevens said he will have another scan done on the hip and will then see a specialist on Feb. 4. The meeting with doctors will give the team a better idea of when Williams might be able to return. But it still won't be before the All-Star break, Stevens said. He hasn't played since Dec. 6.","401161299"
"Despite Jimmy Butler's arrival, David Fizdale gives credit to the Heat front office for the team's success with such a young and talented roster. (0:57) MIAMI --  The Miami Heat built a huge lead, wasted every bit of it, benched their entire starting five and wound up having to go to overtime yet again. Clearly, they like being uncomfortable. Tyler Herro scored 25 points, Jimmy Butler scored nine of his 24 points in overtime and the Heat wasted a 21-point cushion before beating the Washington Wizards 134-129 on Wednesday night. Butler also had 10 assists and seven rebounds for the Heat, who improved to 20-1 at home and 8-0 in overtime this season. Goran Dragic had 22 points and 10 assists, Kendrick Nunn scored 14 points and Duncan Robinson finished with 13 for the Heat. ""I think we just turn it up to another level,"" Herro said of Miami's OT success. ""We don't know we're going to win, but we try to turn it up to another level."" Bradley Beal had a game-high 38 points for Washington on 16 for 24 shooting. Davis Bertans scored 24, Isaiah Thomas and Jordan McRae each had 14 and Ian Mahinmi scored 10 for the Wizards. Washington fell to 1-6 in games decided by five points or less. Miami is 10-4 in such games. The Heat took 36 free throws to Washington's 20, a discrepancy Beal noticed. ""It's kind of sad that we get disrespected, especially myself, disrespected the way I do,"" Beal said. ""I attack the basket. We can look at my last three drives and I got fouled on all three of them. It is what it is."" Beal scored with 22.2 seconds left in overtime to get Washington within 131-129. Butler made one of two free throws to push the lead to three, and Beal got a great look on a stepback 3-pointer that would have tied the game. It hit the back of the iron, bounced over the top of the backboard and Dragic sealed it with a pair of free throws with 7.3 seconds left. Miami led by as many as 21 in the second quarter, settled for a 19-point lead at the half and seemed well on its way to another home win. Until things changed, that is. The Wizards needed about three minutes to slice Miami's lead to 10. Another couple minutes later, it was down to three. And that was enough for Heat coach Erik Spoelstra -- who pulled all five of his starters with 6:41 left in the quarter. For the next 10 minutes and 28 seconds, all five starters stayed on the bench. The backups lost the lead briefly before reclaiming it and going up by as many as 10 on a 3-pointer by Dragic with 9:40 left. Spoelstra put Butler and Bam Adebayo back into the game with 8:13 remaining, hoping Miami could close things out. They could not. The Wizards, down by 10, went on a 19-6 run capped by back-to-back layups by Beal that gave his team a 118-115 lead with 1:35 left. Herro set up James Johnson for a corner 3 a minute later to tie the game, both teams sputtered on their final possessions of regulation and to overtime they went. Perhaps the best on-court sight for the Wizards on Wednesday came about eight hours before the game, when rookie Rui Hachimura was able to go through a full on-court workout for the first time since he injured his groin on Dec. 16. ""Hope to get him back sometime before All-Star break, but there's no rush,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We're going to be careful on his comeback because he hasn't played. We'll ramp it up slowly with some off days, recovery days."" TIP-INS Wizards: Washington started 0 for 8 on 3-pointers and was 4 for 22 from beyond the arc in the first half. The Wizards then started 4 for 5 from deep in the second half, part of the run that gave them the lead. ... Anzejs Pasecniks (sprained left ankle) was out but may play Thursday and Moe Wagner (sprained left ankle) was cleared for non-contact activities. Heat: Miami is 38-1 all-time in home games and 48-2 overall when scoring 125 or more points. ... Former Heat intern Anthony Walker Jr., a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts, was in attendance. ... Robinson made his first 3-point attempt for the fifth consecutive game. TURNABOUT When the teams last played on Dec. 30, the Wizards outscored the Heat by 18 in the second quarter. This time, the Heat won the second quarter by 16 and took a 69-50 lead into the half. WALL UPDATE Hachimura's workout wasn't the only injury news for Washington on Wednesday. Injured Wizards point guard John Wall -- who hasn't played in an NBA game since Dec. 26, 2018, and isn't expected to return at any point this season -- told The Washington Post that he spent part of the day in a gym at a downtown Miami hotel playing 5-on-5, a run that included former Heat players Amar'e Stoudemire and Michael Beasley.","401161300"
"On Feb. 2, 2009, Kobe Bryant broke Michael Jordan's record by scoring 61 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. (1:34) NEW YORK --  LeBron James spent the first half showing why he will soon pass Kobe Bryant for third place on the NBA's career scoring list. Then this season's assists leader put his own offense aside to help Anthony Davis find his. James scored 19 of his 21 points before halftime to quickly cut into Bryant's shrinking lead over him for the No. 3 scoring spot in NBA history, and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New York Knicks 100-92 on Wednesday night. Davis led the Lakers with 28 points in his second game back after a five-game absence, after the Western Conference leaders were handed their worst loss of the season Monday in his return. James took only six shots in a quiet second half but Davis scored 17 points after the break to help the Lakers pull away. ""I was more of a facilitator in the second half,"" James said. ""I wanted to get AD going. He looked a little out of rhythm in the first half. So it was a point of emphasis for me in the third quarter and the fourth quarter to get him going. And that was the difference."" James has 33,599 points, 44 back of Bryant. That leaves him in good shape to catch the former Lakers star Saturday at Philadelphia, where the five-time NBA champion was born. Los Angeles has a game in between Thursday in Brooklyn. Davis scored eight points in the final 3:45 and finished 13 of 13 from the free throw line. He played 30 minutes after going only 23 in his return from a bruised gluteus maximus on Monday in Boston, where the Lakers were routed 139-107. ""Still getting my wind back. Just trying to find a rhythm again,"" Davis said. ""I'm not trying to go out there and get my shots or force anything. Felt good tonight to get to the free throw line and see the ball go in the rim."" Marcus Morris scored 20 points and Damyean Dotson had 17 for the Knicks, who put up a much better effort after losing by 30 two weeks ago in Los Angeles. But they just couldn't come up with timely shots to really threaten the Lakers in the fourth quarter. James shot 8 of 10 in 17 minutes of the first half, but the Knicks held the rest of the Lakers relatively in check and the game was tied at 48 at halftime. The Lakers led by six after three quarters, then opened the fourth with Dwight Howard's dunk, a 3-pointer by Rajon Rondo and a basket by Kyle Kuzma to extend it to 83-70. ""In the first half we weren't making them uncomfortable enough or taking the fight to them enough,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""It was a tie score and we knew there was another gear we had to get to."" New York hung around and was within six again late but the Lakers prevailed despite only two baskets, both by Davis, in the final four minutes. ""I thought we got some pretty good looks at times, and just didn't get them to go,"" Knicks interim coach Mike Miller said. ""We went into it and wanted to play good basketball. I think we went in and played good basketball. We're not out trying to play close games or anything like that, but we took a shot and we came up a few points short."" TIP-INS Lakers: Kuzma had 10 points. ... Howard finished with 12 rebounds off the bench. Knicks: The Knicks attended the memorial service for former NBA Commissioner David Stern on Tuesday at Radio City Music Hall. Stern's son, Eric, thanked Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan for covering the expenses for the event. The Madison Square Garden Company owns Radio City Music Hall. ... Guard Frank Ntilikina was 0 for 8 and scoreless in 12 minutes off the bench. LEBRON AT THE LINE James came into the game averaging 5.5 free throw attempts, which would be a career low and about 2 1/2 per game below his career average. Vogel isn't sure why there's been a reduction because he said James is still aggressively attacking the basket. ""We send clips in all the time to the league office, so I don't know why he's not getting calls,"" Vogel said. SMITH RETURNS Knicks guard Dennis Smith Jr. returned after missing 13 games with a strained left oblique. He entered in the third quarter and was scoreless in four minutes, missing both shots.","401161301"
"TORONTO --  Already without star center Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers couldnt overcome losing another starter to injury. Pascal Siakam had 18 points and 15 rebounds, Fred VanVleet scored 22 and the Toronto Raptors beat the short-handed 76ers 107-95 on Wednesday night, extending their winning streak to five. Philadelphia lost guard Josh Richardson when he strained his left hamstring while trying to make a steal four minutes into the first quarter. He did not return. Hes a big part of this team defensively and offensively, so were going to miss him for however long hes out, Sixers guard Ben Simmons said. Richardson had scored 15 or more points in seven of the past eight games, He did not speak to reporters following the game, but the team said he will be re-evaluated Thursday. Richardson missed six games in late November and early December because of a right hamstring injury. Embiid missed his eighth straight game after undergoing surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left hand. We thought that our best opportunity to steal a win on the road without Jo and J-Rich was going to be to hunt some 3s and spread the thing around and play fast and share the ball, 76ers coach Brett Brown said. At the start of the game, in the first period, we did that quite well. Philadelphia connected on seven of 14 attempts from beyond the arc in the first, but just 11 of 32 the rest of the way. After making 14 field goals in the first, the Sixers had 18 in the final three quarters combined. Even with guys out we still had a chance to be in this game and get a win, forward Tobias Harris said. Give them credit, they did a really good job after the first quarter defending us. Norman Powell scored 18 points, Marc Gasol shot 7 for 7 and finished with 17 points, and Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka each scored 16 as the Raptors won their 15th straight at home against the 76ers. They had like five totally uncontested 3s in the first four minutes of the game but we (defended) when it mattered, Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. We were moving and flying, playing physical most of the second half, I thought. Simmons had 17 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for the 76ers, narrowly missing his second straight triple-double. But he had just two points and one rebound in the fourth quarter as Philadelphias four-game winning streak was snapped. There was a physicality to their game that you felt, Brown said of Torontos defense. Harris scored 22 points, Furkan Korkmaz had 17 and Matisse Thybulle 13 for the 76ers. Philadelphia trailed 93-90 after Simmons scored on a dunk with 4:26 left in the fourth, his only points of the final quarter, but Toronto answered with a 10-0 run over the next three minutes as the Sixers missed five straight shots. We turned the ball over a couple of times in that stretch, which led to them getting out in transition, Harris said. On our part, we didnt get good offensive execution on getting up good shots and good looks that we needed. Its something that weve got to get better at. Harris stopped the drought with a pair of free throws in the final minute, but it was too late for the 76ers. TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons had six assists in the first quarter, as many as the Raptors had as a team.  Al Horford grabbed 10 rebounds but shot 3 for 11 and scored seven points.  Philadelphia is 9-15 on the road. The Sixers had won two straight away from home following a six-game road losing streak. Raptors: F Patrick McCaw had to be helped to the locker room with a towel pressed to his face after being struck by Norvel Pelles arm while fighting for a rebound early in the second. The Raptors said McCaw broke his nose and will see a specialist Thursday. He is not expected to travel with the team for Fridays game against the Knicks. END OF THE LINE Powell failed to extend his career-best streak of five straight 20-point games. He had the ball with time winding down but declined to shoot. PAINT PRESENCE With Embiid sidelined, Toronto outscored Philadelphia 52-18 in the paint. DO YOU REMEMBER? The 76ers havent won a regular-season game north of the border since Nov. 10, 2012.","401161302"
"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls envisioned Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen providing a powerful one-two punch and leading them to the playoffs coming off one of the worst seasons in franchise history. This was more like it. LaVine scored 25 points, Markkanen added 21 and the Chicago Bulls overcame a big performance by Karl-Anthony Towns to beat the struggling Minnesota Timberwolves 117-110 on Wednesday night. ""I'm a glass-half-full type of (person),"" LaVine said. ""There's still a lot of games to be played."" LaVine had seven points in the final 2:25 to help Chicago pull out the win after letting a 19-point lead in the second quarter slip away. His 3-pointer put the Bulls ahead for good at 111-108 with 1:26 remaining. LaVine then hit two free throws with 26 seconds left. Kris Dunn sank four more foul shots and the Bulls came out on top after losing nine of 12. Towns scored a season-high 40 points, but the Timberwolves lost their seventh straight. LaVine, pushing for a spot in the All-Star Game next month in Chicago, hit three 3-pointers. Markkanen, whose scoring and rebounding are down from last season, nailed four from beyond the arc in his highest-scoring game since he finished with 26 points in a loss to Dallas on Jan. 6. ""They're two important pieces,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""They have a responsibility to grow and get better, but also to help us win. They're doing the best they can.""

""Like I said before, I just felt I had to get implemented back into the offense,"" he said. ""There was so many things that changed and everything when I was out, I was just trying to find myself in the offense. I think it was taken the wrong way when I said it. I was more saying the plays weren't meant for me anymore, it was different, but the coaching staff did a great job and we talked it out."" Andrew Wiggins scored 25 points -- all but three in the second half. Shabazz Napier added 16 points and seven rebounds. The Timberwolves tied it at 66 midway through the third quarter on Gorgui Dieng's 3-pointer and grabbed their first lead since the opening minutes when Wiggins nailed a 3 to make it 69-68. The teams kept trading leads until the closing minutes. STRONG START Towns, coming off a 28-point effort against Denver on Monday, scored 12 of Minnesota's first 14. But that didn't stop the Bulls from going up by 19 in the first half. They scored 11 straight points late in the opening quarter to go ahead by 14, then went on a 14-3 run early in the second. Coby White capped that spurt with a layup to make it 49-30 with 5:41 left, but Minnesota pulled within seven at halftime. ""I liked the second half. I hated the first half,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Bottom line, you are not going to win games like that. We're not a very good basketball team right now.""

"NEW ORLEANS --  Zion Williamson scored the final point of his first NBA regular season game as a packed and standing crowd belted out chants of M-V-P! Then the NBA's No. 1 overall draft pick went to the bench -- as mandated by medical staff -- and watched the game slip away from the Pelicans while unheeded chants of, We want Zion! echoed around the Smoothie King Center. Williamson capped his long-awaited NBA debut by scoring 17 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and stirring the crowd into a frenzy  but the savvy and composed San Antonio Spurs weathered the surge for a 121-117 victory Wednesday night. The celebrated rookie out of Duke, whose maiden regular season appearance was delayed three months by arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, said watching the final five minutes from the bench out of caution was very hard. I'm 19, honestly. In that moment, I'm not thinking about longevity, Williamson continued. I'm thinking about winning that game, so it was very tough. LaMarcus Aldridge had 32 points and 14 rebounds, DeMar DeRozan added 20 points, and the San Antonio Spurs withstood Williamson's late surge for a 121-117 victory over New Orleans on Wednesday night. The crowd got into it. We didnt let it rattle us, DeRozan said, adding that Williamson went on a hell of a run. ""It was great that we held our composure, executed when we needed to, and came up with stops when we needed to, DeRozan added. With Spurs coach Gregg Popovich sending double-teams at Williamson, the rookie struggled to find his shot during the first three quarters. When the fourth quarter began, he had just five points, four rebounds, an assist and four turnovers in a little less than 12 minutes. But when the 6-foot-6, 285-pound Williamson found himself open for a straight-on 3 with about nine minutes to go, he let it fly and it went down, infusing the stadium with energy. He followed that up with a torrid three-minute stretch in which he laid in an alley-oop lob, put back a missed shot with a reverse layup and hit three more 3s. Williamson wasn't known for shooting 3s when he starred at Duke. He was so often able to dominate inside. But Williamson noted that his long rehabilitation probably helped him refine his outside shot. When you're not able to move around and do athletic movements for a while, the only thing you can do is just shoot spot-up jumpers, I guess that was the result of that. His teammates loved it. The first one, I was like, All right. Cool, guard Jrue Holiday said. Then the second three I was like, 'All right, boy, youve been practicing.' And the third one, and from that point on, the energy was crazy."" Williamson came into the game knowing his playing time would be limited -- even though he started. He had played a total of 18:18 when he was subbed out for good with the Pelicans -- who trailed by 12 to start the final period -- down 109-108. Soon after, DeRozan began San Antonio's decisive surge with a finger roll and pull-up jumper. Aldridge followed with a tip-in and jumper shortly after. New Orleans got as close as 119-117 on Josh Hart's 3, but Aldridge responded with two free throws and the Spurs did not give up another basket. I was really proud of our guys, Popovich said. We took a huge blow. We stayed the course and just played. Brandon Ingram scored 22 for New Orleans but missed 16 of 22 shots, while Lonzo Ball had 14 points and 12 assists. Williamson entered the Smoothie King Center wearing a black suit with a blue design and blue basketball sneakers. Written in pink on the black T-shirt he wore under his sport coat was the expression, Let's Dance, which was his message to New Orleans the night the Pelicans drafted him. He certainly found his rhythm in the fourth quarter of his first game, raising hopes for what lies ahead in New Orleans' remaining 37 games. It was everything I dreamed of, except for the losing part, Williamson said. Just the energy the crowd brought, the energy the city brought, it was electric and I'm just grateful that they did that. So it was a dream come true to finally get out there, but at the end of the day I did want to win, so we've got to look to the next game. TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray scored 13 and Derrick White 12. ... DeRozan has scored at least 20 points in 15 of 16 games. ... Rudy Gay returned after being sidelined three games by an illness. He had two rebounds in nine minutes off the bench. Pelicans: Jrue Holiday scored 12 points. ... Derrick Favors had 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... JJ Redick and Hart each scored 10 points. POP'S PRAISE Popovich sounded genuinely enthused to be in the building for Williamson's first game. You just feel like youre seeing a new generation come in and you get to see it. You get to be right in the middle of it,"" Popovich said before tip-off. The 24th-year Spurs head coach, who has won five championships, began to reminisce about his first NBA job as a San Antonio assistant under Larry Brown in the 1988-89 season, which was the heart of the Michael Jordan era. I can remember my first days as an assistant for Larry and being mesmerized sitting on the bench watching Michael go up and down the court. I dont even know if I knew what was going on in the game. I just couldnt take my eyes off of him, Popovich said. So, I think about that and now weve got this generation coming in and its been a lot of fun to see.","401161305"
"PHOENIX --  T.J. Warren's first game against his former team went about as well as possible. He scored a game-high 25 points, had three steals and played excellent defense against former teammate Devin Booker. Most importantly, he won. Warren was the star, Domantas Sabonis added 24 points and the Indiana Pacers rolled to a 112-87 victory over the Suns on Wednesday night. ""There were a lot of emotions but as soon as the ball went into the air it was time to play basketball,"" Warren said. ""That's all I was focused on."" Warren was playing his first game against the Suns after being traded from Phoenix to Indiana during the offseason. The sixth-year forward -- who played his first five years with the Suns -- shot 11 of 18 from the field. The 6-foot-8 Warren was one of the Suns' top scorers during his time in the desert, but the franchise struggled through five losing seasons. Things have been much different in Indiana, which looks like a lock for the playoffs with a 29-16 record and has won six of its last seven games. ""It's a lot of fun,"" Warren said. ""Just coming into a family-oriented organization, continuing to build and get better with these guys. Everyone compliments each other, everybody gets along. It's just great to be in an environment like that."" Sabonis added 13 rebounds. The Pacers bounced back from a lopsided loss to Utah 118-88 two days ago and now have a six-game winning streak in the series against the Suns. ""I love the way we responded,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""I thought we were solid for 48 minutes."" Phoenix never led and trailed by 25 by midway through the third quarter. The Suns missed their first 11 shots from 3-point range before Elie Okobo hit one late in the third. Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 17 points and nine rebounds. Booker added 16 points. The Suns shot 30 of 84 (36%) from the field and were held under 90 points for just the second time this season. ""Obviously, not a great output tonight of Suns' basketball, the way we want to play, and we've got to figure it out,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. Indiana led 54-48 at halftime. Warren and Sabonis both scored 12 points for the Pacers before the break. Booker scored 14 points for the Suns. They lost both games of a two-game homestand after losing to the Pacers and dropping a 120-118 decision to San Antonio on Monday. ""It's one of those nights in the NBA that didn't go our way,"" Suns guard Ricky Rubio said. ""We didn't play good and we just have to respond."" BROGDON MISSES SECOND HALF Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon didn't return to the game after leaving in the second quarter and getting three stitches for a cut on his forehead. Brogdon scored five points and had three assists. He came into the game averaging 17.4 points and 7.4 assists. T.J. McConnell started the second half in Brodgon's place and finished with 10 points and 11 assists. McMillan said Brogdon was being checked out for a concussion and that he ""wasn't feeling good enough to come back."" WHERE'S THE 3-BALL? The Suns shot just 4 of 20 from 3-point range while the Pacers were 9 of 20 from long range. It was just the second game in the NBA this season where both teams attempted 20 or fewer 3-pointers. The only other game was on Jan. 9, when the Cavaliers and Pistons both shot 20 3s according to basketball-reference.com. HIT THE ROAD Phoenix plays six of its next seven games on the road. That might be a good thing for the Suns: They're 9-10 on the road and just 9-16 at home. TIP-INS Pacers: Warren and the 32nd overall pick in the 2019 draft were traded to the Pacers on draft day. He averaged a career-high 19.6 points two years ago and was the 14th overall pick in the 2014 draft. .. The Pacers had 45 bench points. Doug McDermott had 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting. Suns: Rookie forward Cameron Johnson missed his third straight game with a right quad contusion. Johnson is averaging 7.8 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. ... Forward Aron Baynes (left hip soreness) missed his second straight game. He's averaging a career-high 11.5 points and 5.8 rebounds.","401161306"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  The Utah Jazz thrive on making that one extra pass to pile up assists, even if it means they run right up against the shot clock on many possessions. It sure helps to have the steady hand of Rudy Gobert in the post to finish. Gobert had 22 points, 15 rebounds and three blocked shots, and Donovan Mitchell scored 23 to lead the streaking Jazz past the Golden State Warriors 129-96 on Wednesday night. ""It's something our team values. Sometimes you get to a point where you're up against the shot clock because they're making another pass, but it's infectious,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""When guys start doing that, the shots become easier when you know that your teammates are endorsing them with an extra pass."" D'Angelo Russell overcame a slow start to score 26 points for the Warriors, who lost for the 11th time in 12 games and couldn't build any momentum at Chase Center after ending a five-game home losing streak with Saturday's victory over Orlando. Marquese Chriss of the Warriors and Utah's Tony Bradley were ejected with 21.9 seconds left after jawing at each other. Gobert shot 10 for 13. He pulled down six rebounds in the first quarter as Utah jumped to a big lead, shooting 61.9% in the opening 12 minutes. The Jazz hit 13 of their first 20 shots but then missed five in a row while the Warriors were just 7 for 24 -- including 1 of 7 on 3-pointers. Golden State's Draymond Green picked up his NBA-leading 12th technical at the 5:28 mark of the third, moving him within four of an automatic one-game suspension. Green returned and had five points and four rebounds in 25 minutes after he missed the previous two games, first with a sprained left index finger and then when he wasn't feeling well during Monday's 129-124 overtime loss at Portland. Golden State welcomed back two other players from injuries after losing at Portland with just eight available -- the fourth time this season the Warriors have been that thin because of injuries or other circumstances. Joe Ingles dished out eight of 31 assists for the Jazz, five in the first quarter, in Utah's third straight victory and 13th in 14 games as the teams wrapped up their season series with the fourth meeting. ""I think we ran into a team that's playing about as well as anybody in the league,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""They're clicking, they're dominating right now. They dominated us at both ends right from the beginning and I thought we got demoralized in the first half. That was probably the biggest disappointment. I just didn't love our energy or body language. That's sometimes the way it goes when you're struggling."" Jazz guard Mike Conley scored eight points in 19 minutes, playing his third game after missing 14 straight and 19 of 20 with tightness in his left hamstring. He scored 14 points in a 118-88 win against the Pacers on Monday, increasing his minutes from 15-plus to nearly 18. ALL-STAR GOBERT? Kerr certainly believes Gobert deserves his first All-Star nod. The Warriors coach has a criteria for picking his All-Stars, and one of them is winning -- ""players that are playing on winning teams,"" he said. Gobert, Utah's 7-foot-1 center, fits that bill. ""He's absolutely one of those guys who's right there every year,"" Kerr said. ""He has not made it yet? That's surprising to me. But I think every year he's for sure one of those guys in that group who's going to be close, right on the edge. I think this year probably will have a better chance based on their success, but that's without having really looked at the numbers yet, either."" TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert received a technical foul with 6:27 left in third and his team ahead 82-52. ... Utah, which has won eight of the last 10 meetings in the series, swept Golden State for the first time since winning all three games in 2009-10, and took all four games for the first time since 2001-02. ... The Jazz had lost nine of 12 on the Warriors' home floor. Warriors: G Jacob Evans III was cleared from concussion protocol before the game and played wearing a protective mask on his broken nose following a three-game absence since he took an elbow in the face from Dallas F Dwight Powell last Tuesday.

"CLEVELAND --  Washington Wizards coach Scott Brooks wanted his players to embrace the adversity they faced going into Thursday night. They certainly listened. Bradley Beal scored 36 points and the weary Wizards, overcoming an overtime loss and early morning arrival in town, defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 124-112. The Wizards started slowly following a long flight after an OT defeat in Miami on Wednesday, but took over late in the first quarter and pulled away. ""My analytics guy tells me we're 1-0 when we get in after 4 (a.m.),"" Brooks said. ""We played about as hard as you can play last night and we did it again tonight. It wasn't easy. I'm tired and I was just coaching."" Beal was 15 of 22 from the field and had eight assists in 29 minutes. The Wizards guard scored 38 points against Miami and is 31 of 46 from the field in the last two games. ""That's one thing Coach Brooks and I say a lot, your stats are going to level out at the end of the year,"" Beal said. ""Shots will fall, shots won't fall, but everything will level out in the end. I know I'm a good shooter."" Cleveland has lost six in a row and 11 of 13. The Cavaliers were coming off a 20-point home loss to New York on Monday and struggled against the Wizards, who are also at the bottom of the Eastern Conference. Kevin Love, who scored 21 points, believes the Cavaliers should be better as a group. Cleveland hasn't won since a surprising victory at Denver on Jan. 11. ""Games like tonight and the last game against the Knicks, we feel like those are teams we should have a very good chance to compete with and win,"" Love said. ""Obviously, there are teams like Denver that we can beat on any given night, but we feel like we when we put it together we should be able to win games like tonight."" Washington shot 55% and hit 16 of 36 3-pointers. Davis Bertans and Ish Smith each scored 17 points, while Isaiah Thomas had 13 for the Wizards. Collin Sexton scored 29 points for Cleveland. Larry Nance Jr. had 22. The Cavaliers led 18-6 before the Wizards took control, thanks to Beal and Bertans, and built a 40-26 lead. The offense didn't slow down after halftime. Beal had 11 points in the third quarter and the Wizards opened a 98-78 cushion. TIP-INS Wizards: Brooks, with several starters on minutes limits, used 11 players in the first half. ...

"NEW YORK --  LeBron James is on his way to Philadelphia, set to pass Kobe Bryant on the NBA's career scoring list in the former Lakers star's hometown. It'll be another milestone achievement, but scoring has never been the most important thing to James. He prefers winning, and it looks like he'll do plenty more of that with these Lakers. James had 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in his 10th triple-double of the season and Los Angeles made a season-high 19 3-pointers to pull away and beat the Brooklyn Nets 128-113 on Thursday night. James closed within 17 points of Bryant for No. 3 with a flurry in the fourth quarter. He can pass Bryant on Saturday at Philadelphia, where the five-time champion was born. ""Any time I am linked with the greats or I am able to do something in my career where I'm mentioned with the greats is a pretty cool thing,"" James said. ""But as far as looking at the scoring, I don't know. That doesn't mean much to me. ""Just the overall point of my game is what means more to me: being an all-around player, being able to be successful on the floor and being able to contribute to the franchises that I played for, the three franchises I played for so far in my career."" James has 33,626 points. Bryant finished with 33,643. A back-and-forth game for nearly three quarters turned into a rout after the Lakers broke the Nets' spirits with four straight 3-pointers spanning the third and fourth quarters, extending a one-point lead to 107-94, and Los Angeles coasted from there. Anthony Davis had 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Dwight Howard finished with 14 points and 12 boards in his first start of the season. Kyrie Irving scored 20 points after missing a game with right hamstring tightness, but the Nets lost their fifth straight. Brooklyn has won just two of its last 14 games. The Nets were without backup centers DeAndre Jordan and Nicolas Claxton, leaving them without many options behind starter Jarrett Allen. But they struggled just as badly guarding the perimeter. Los Angeles was 19 of 38 behind the arc, with Nets coach Kenny Atkinson saying his players were so worried about James that they left guys open outside. ""He started making shots and guys are just, they don't want to see him score again and they help too much,"" Atkinson said. ""I would say there's 10, 12 plays where we helped too much and you make one false step with a great passing team like them, they make you pay."" The Lakers led 38-35 after one, before both teams made seven 3-pointers in the second. Howard went 4 for 4 for eight points in the period, helping the Lakers take a 75-70 lead to halftime. Danny Green made three 3s in the first four minutes of the third, pushing the lead to 88-75, but the Nets had it down to 95-94 after a 3-pointer by Irving with 49 seconds remaining. But then Davis and Rajon Rondo hit 3s before Jared Dudley, who played in Brooklyn last season, hit one from near the Nets' bench to beat the buzzer and make it 104-94. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made it four straight 3s to open the fourth, extending the lead back to 13. James then scored eight in the period before taking a seat for good. TIP-INS Lakers: Howard started with JaVale McGee ill. ... James, Howard and Davis met with former President Bill Clinton after the game. He was seated courtside for the second straight Nets game. ... Lakers coach Frank Vogel has a pair of former Nets head coaches on his staff in Jason Kidd and Lionel Hollins. Nets: Taurean Prince scored 18 points and Caris LeVert had 16. ... Brooklyn made 21 3s. ... The Nets were trying for their third straight victory over the Lakers. ALL-STAR SELECTIONS James and Davis were voted as starters for the NBA All-Star Game. James, who will captain a team as the leading vote-getter among fans, will make his record 16th straight start next month in Chicago. And Vogel and his staff will coach Team LeBron, after the Lakers (36-9, .800) clinched at least a tie for the best record in the Western Conference through games played on Feb. 2. ""Well, our coaching staff has done a phenomenal job. You know, they really have. They've hit home runs and grand slams every game with their game plan and helping me manage this group,"" Vogel said. ""Couldn't be happier for those guys. But Irving missed out a spot when he was passed by Kemba Walker. Irving was second among fans but finished sixth in the player and media rankings. BLOCKING LEBRON A photo of Allen blocking a hard-charging James at the rim in a game last season hangs on a wall in a Barclays Center hallway. Atkinson said Allen showed with that play and many others that he had the defensive toughness that critics thought he lacked coming out of college. ""There are guys who would run into the hallway when LeBron goes up for a dunk. He stands there and will protect the rim and his teammates love that about him, his coaches love that about him,"" Atkinson said.","401161309"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard had another big performance, scoring a game-high 47 points. But a tough loss and issues with the officiating had the Portland Trail Blazers star in a foul mood. Luka Doncic scored 27 points to go with nine assists and six rebounds, and the Dallas Mavericks made 22 3-pointers in a 133-125 victory Thursday night with a complete team performance that overcame Lillard's hot shooting. After picking up a technical foul in the final seconds, Lillard voiced his frustrations with the officiating. ""We're down by 13 with four minutes left, I was driving for a reverse layup and I got smacked on the head,"" Lillard said. ""I asked (the referee) why he didn't call it and he said, all three of us agreed you leaned into him. ""That's an insult, man."" One game after scoring a career-high 61 points, Lillard became the first player in franchise history to score 100 points over two games. ""Before the game, I tried to pass a note down to their locker room to tell Lillard that he had my All-Star vote,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Obviously, he didn't get the note, but he had my vote before he went for 47 against us. What an amazing player. He's virtually impossible to stop. He's got an iron will. He's obviously a great leader. ""When he's on the floor they're hard to beat no matter what."" The Mavericks needed Doncic, who scored 20 of his points in the first half, and plenty of help in the win. Dallas had six players make at least three 3-pointers, and it was the sixth time this season the Mavericks made 20 3s, with Seth Curry and Jalen Brunson leading the way with four each. The 43 combined 3-pointers made by Dallas and Portland tied an NBA record. Trevor Ariza, recently acquired in a trade from Sacramento, scored a season-high 21 in his Portland debut. ""I thought he was terrific,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts. Lillard's hot shooting alone wasn't enough to stay in front of a high-powered Mavericks team that has the league's No. 1 ranked offense. Although Dallas went off for a monstrous 45-point quarter to begin the game, Lillard kept Portland within striking distance. The Mavericks cooled in the second quarter -- but only a little bit. They pushed their lead to as high as 17 in the second quarter. Even after missing their last eight 3-pointers to end the half, they still led 78-63 at halftime. After the Mavericks' lead ballooned to as much as 25 in the third quarter, Lillard got hot again. He scored nine straight points in the third quarter to cut the lead to 11 with under five minutes left in the quarter. Another 3-pointer by Carmelo Anthony cut the lead to eight and it was a 17-0 run before the Mavericks snapped it on a 3-pointer from Dorian Finney-Smith with 3:19 left in the third. Dallas led 103-90 after three quarters. After losing center Dwight Powell to a season-ending Achilles injury, the Mavericks played more with Kristpas Porzingis at center. ""We're running out of big men, so were going to be smaller in a lot of these situations,"" Carlisle said. ""This is an adjustment that we needed to make tonight, so we had a lot of spacing to attack the paint. Him being on the floor creates problems for the other team defensively."" Porzingis had 20 points and five rebounds while shooting 3 of 4 from the 3-point line. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic earned his first All-Star selection Thursday. ""So excited for him, so excited for our franchise,"" Carlisle said. ""It's so well-deserved. It's just a really exciting time -- for our team, for him, for his career and certainly the future."" The NBA announced that Doncic would be in the pool of starting players from the Eastern and Western Conference to be selected by All-Star captains LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Trail Blazers: Thursday was the first game for three new players on the Blazers acquired in a trade from Sacramento: Ariza, Caleb Swanigan and Wenyen Gabriel. Stotts told reporters that Ariza would start upon arrival and that his veteran experience makes it easier for Portland to operate like usual. ""A lot of the actions, he's seen before,"" Stotts said. ""We've thrown a lot at him. Since he'll be out there with four other guys who know what's going on, it shouldn't be too difficult for him. For other players, it will be more difficult.""","401161310"
"PARIS -- Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 16 rebounds and the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 116-103 on Friday night in the first NBA regular-season game in France. Milwaukee improved to 40-6 with its eighth consecutive victory. The Bucks have the best 46-game start in franchise history. They were 39-7 in 1970-71, when they went on to win the NBA championship. ""The focus and the purpose of this team has been very good,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We feel like there's a lot of work to be done, a lot of things to improve."" Eric Bledsoe added 20 points and five assists for the Bucks, who looked rusty in the first two quarters. ""I only practiced once before the game. It's kind of hard to get into a rhythm. We weren't moving the ball as much,"" said Antetokounmpo, who had his fourth triple-double of the season on Monday against the Chicago Bulls. ""Hopefully, we can learn from the game. Close to the third quarter, the bench came back in and did a great job. In the fourth quarter we were able to close out the game."" Malik Monk led Charlotte with 31 points. ""I thought Malik was fantastic, made plays for us. He's an incredible athlete,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""The challenge now is to do it on a night-to-night basis."" The Hornets have lost eight in a row -- the team's longest streak since it dropped 10 straight during the 2014-15 season. Milwaukee rallied to tie it at 78 going into the fourth quarter. Pat Connaughton put the Bucks in front with a dunk in the fourth. Then Antetokounmpo got going, drawing a foul as he slalomed through the defense. ""Our guys competed hard, put us in a position to win the game against the best team in the NBA,"" Borrego said. ""The start of the fourth starts with a turnover, and that set the tone for the rest of the quarter. It spiraled from there."" Budenholzer, meanwhile, improved to 100-28 in regular-season games with the Bucks. There was a reason why this victory was such a grind for long periods. ""I thought Charlotte was great tonight,"" Budenholzer said. ""Their defense was great."" There was, naturally, a French feel to the night. Former San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker was given a huge ovation by the crowd before the game. So was Ronny Turiaf, an NBA champion with the Miami Heat in 2012. Nicolas Batum, who scored five points for the Hornets, raised his hand to the crowd chanting his name at the end. Paris Saint-Germain soccer stars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe -- the world's two most expensive players -- were cheering on the Bucks all night. For Antetokounmpo, who is a big fan of PSG and was a guest at the Parc des Princes stadium this week, it was a strange feeling. ""It's insane. The crazy part is that we're really big fans of them and they're big fans of the team. You never expect them to know who we are and what we do, and be fans of the Bucks,"" he said. ""But it was amazing they came to the game. They came to the locker room afterwards, we exchanged jerseys, took pictures with them."" TIP-INS Bucks: This was Milwaukee's second time playing a regular-season game outside of North America. The Bucks beat New York in London on Jan. 15, 2015. ... Antetokounmpo, who will captain one of the teams at the All-Star Game on Feb. 16 in Chicago because he was the leading Eastern Conference vote-getter, is set to become the first player in Bucks history to start four consecutive All-Star Games. Hornets: When the NBA picked the Hornets to play in the game back on March 28, Charlotte had longtime French star Parker and All-Star guard Kemba Walker on the roster. That was before Parker retired and Walker signed with Boston in free agency.","401161311"
"DETROIT --  Jaren Jackson Jr.'s big first half helped the Memphis Grizzlies return to their high-scoring ways. Jackson scored 24 of his 29 points in the first two quarters, and he sank a big 3-pointer in the fourth to lift the Grizzlies to a 125-112 win over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. Memphis took an early 15-point lead, and after the Pistons rallied, the Grizzlies controlled the last few minutes of the game. ""For us to come out and throw the first punch, it was good,"" said Jackson, a former Michigan State star. ""And then late, we didn't waiver, and we finished the game strong."" Memphis was coming off a 119-95 loss at Boston, a game that snapped the Grizzlies' streak of 14 straight games with at least 110 points. They bounced back by shooting 54% from the field, 11 of 22 from beyond the arc and 28 of 31 on free throws against the Pistons. ""It shows our aggression, getting downhill and getting fouled,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Guys play the right way, we get the efficient shots, we get open shots, it usually leads to high percentages for us."" The Grizzlies are averaging 121 points this month. Jackson was limited by foul trouble after halftime, but his 3-pointer with just over three minutes remaining gave the Grizzlies a 114-108 lead. Ja Morant had 16 points and 12 assists for Memphis, and Dillon Brooks scored 22 of his 27 points in the second half. Derrick Rose had 22 points for the Pistons, who were missing center Andre Drummond because of a lacerated lip. The Grizzlies went on a 14-0 run and led 35-20 late in the first quarter. There was plenty of time for Detroit to come back, and the Pistons had the game tied before the midway point of the second. It was close for most of the second half. Detroit look a 104-103 lead on a 3-pointer by Reggie Jackson, but Brandon Clarke's layup off an assist from Morant put Memphis back ahead. Jaren Jackson's big 3-pointer gave the Grizzlies a little bit of a cushion, and the Pistons never really recovered. ""We just had some breakdowns toward the end of the game that's not supposed to happen,"" Detroit forward Markieff Morris said. ""They're a young, quick team. They play hard, they play together and they've got some young, great talent."" STANDINGS Detroit now trails eighth-place Brooklyn by 2 1/2 games in the Eastern Conference. Memphis entered the day a half-game behind eighth-place San Antonio in the West. The Spurs hosted Phoenix on Friday night. SPLIT UP Rose and Reggie Jackson started for Detroit -- it was Jackson's second game back from a lumbar stress reaction that has kept him out most of the season. Jackson finished with 14 points but was not among the five players who started the third quarter for the Pistons. Coach Dwane Casey indicated that was because the team closed the first quarter so poorly while neither Rose nor Jackson was on the court. ""You give up a lead, now the rest of the night we are clawing from behind,"" Casey said. ""Trying to generate some offense with our second unit is why we split them up in the second half."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis was missing F Bruno Caboclo (knee). Pistons: In addition to Drummond, the Pistons have been without star F Blake Griffin (knee) -- and on Friday they were also without G Bruce Brown (illness), F Tony Snell (illness) and G Luke Kennard (knee). ... Rose scored at least 20 points for an 11th straight game, the longest streak of his career.","401161312"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Boston Celtics were missing a lot of starters. They still had the two they needed: Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward Walker scored 37 points and Hayward added 22 to help the Celtics rally from a 16-point first-half deficit and defeat the Orlando Magic 109-98 on Friday night. Walker also handed out six assists and Hayward grabbed a game-high 14 rebounds as Boston won without regulars Jason Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Enes Kanter. Daniel Theis contributed 16 points and bench players led an aggressive and effective defense to help Boston with its third straight. You have to focus even more so when guys are out to do your job as well as you can, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Thats what good teams do. You have to play with that kind of effort and do the little things that win games. Walker scored 19 of his points in the second quarter, when the Celtics faced a 46-30 deficit. The Celtics point guard single-handedly kept a disorganized offense from digging too deep a hole by hitting 10 of 16 shots in the first half, including four 3-pointers. I thought (Walker) gave us everything he had in the first half and we were worried (whether) he would have much left, Stevens said. It was up to everyone else to take it to another level at that point and fortunately we did. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 30 points, but he had little help in the fourth quarter when his teammates combined to shoot 3 of 11 and commit three turnovers. Nikola Vucevic finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Aaron Gordon was the only other player in double figures with 12 points. Walker didnt score in the third period, but Hayward and the aggressive defense were enough to allow Boston to pull away. Hayward scored 12 points, grabbed eight rebounds and had four assists as Boston wiped out the 16-point deficit and took an 82-77 lead into the fourth quarter. Boston expanded it lead to 95-81 when Walker drilled his sixth 3-pointer of the game with 8:46 to go. Obviously, we had some of our top scorers out, so I tried to be more aggressive, Hayward said. I always try to be a playmaker and help the bigs out on the boards. Meanwhile, the Celtics defense disrupted the Magic's offense on nearly every possession. Orlando was just 14 of 43 (32.6%) in the second half and had only six assists on those 14 baskets. At the end of the day, if youre going to beat that team, youre going to have to play through contact, not turn the ball over and have clean possessions, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. It takes offensive energy and force and we had none of that. Still, Fourniers shooting helped Orlando cut the deficit to 103-98 when Terrence Ross nailed a 3-pointer with 2:29 to play, but the Magic didnt score the rest of the game. Boston picked up the pace considerably on defense in the second half. The Celtics limited Orlando to just 7 of 25 shooting (28%) in the third quarter, outscoring the Magic 29-20 to take an 82-77 lead. Walker didnt score in that quarter, but the Celtics didnt need him as Boston started to spread its scoring around.

"NEW YORK --  On Star Wars night at Madison Square Garden, the Toronto Raptors showed why they remain a galaxy far, far away from the New York Knicks. With All-Star players and big-game experience, the NBA champions have too many assets the Knicks simply lack. Were just a team that, we are comfortable in every situation,"" point guard Kyle Lowry said. We understand what to do and weve been here before."" Lowry scored 26 points, Pascal Siakam had 23 and the Raptors beat the Knicks 118-112 on Friday night for their sixth straight victory. A night after being voted to start the All-Star Game, Siakam had two big baskets down the stretch. He drove for a dunk with 1:09 left and Toronto leading by only one, then nailed a 3-pointer with 21 seconds remaining after the Knicks had closed within three. Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell each finished with 16 points for the Raptors, who beat the last-place Knicks for the eighth straight time. I think were battle-tested,"" Siakam said. We are a team that has guys that understand what it takes to win and when everything is not going right, dont panic and continue to play."" Marcus Morris and Damyean Dotson each scored 21 points for the Knicks, who have dropped five of six. Julius Randle had 20 points and 11 rebounds. Along with performers dressed in Star Wars costumes, fans were treated to music and sound effects from the science fiction franchise. In another unusual sound for Madison Square Garden, a loud Let's go Raptors! Let's go Raptors! broke out in the fourth quarter. And as usual, the Raptors fans left happy. Toronto has won 16 of the last 18 meetings, including four straight in New York. But the Knicks made it tough, just as they did in recent losses to Philadelphia and the Lakers. Well, its tough because we competed the entire game,"" Morris said. Definitely tough to keep losing like that."" New York had held its last three opponents to 100 points or fewer, but the Raptors have too much firepower to be held down too long. Even after a slow start, they weren't far off the 124.2 points they averaged in the first five games of their winning streak. The Knicks jumped out to a 26-13 lead and were up by 10 in the second quarter before the Raptors ran off 13 straight points, with Lowry's 3-pointer making it 43-40. Toronto led 56-53 at halftime. Lowry and VanVleet made 3s to open the second half and the lead grew to 67-55 when Siakam converted a three-point play, but the Knicks knocked half of it off by the end of the period and Toronto took an 85-79 lead to the fourth. TIP-INS Raptors; Coach Nick Nurse said F Patrick McCaw, who left Toronto's victory over Philadelphia on Wednesday in the second quarter, had a broken nose. He said McCaw would be re-evaluated Saturday with hopes he could play in the next game Sunday. ... Toronto is 8-3 in January, clinching its 21st straight month with a winning record, dating to February 2017. That's the longest streak in franchise history and the longest current streak in the NBA. Knicks: Rookie RJ Barrett missed his fourth straight game with a sprained right ankle, missing a chance to play against his hometown team. Interim coach Mike Miller said Barrett was set for another evaluation on his progress. ... Elfrid Payton had 13 points and 11 assists. SIAKAM IN CHICAGO Siakam, the winner of last season's Most Improved Player award, was voted an All-Star starter despite missing 11 games with a groin strain. He came in averaging 23.5 points after scoring 16.9 per game last season, when he broke out in his third season. Its a hell of a climb in a couple years and I think not only for him,"" Nurse said. Ive always said this repeatedly, he went to work on his game and he put in some serious time and had some great, I think, inner drive and at the same time handled all that was coming each time."" WHAT ABOUT NURSE? The Raptors coach has a chance to join Siakam at All-Star weekend in Chicago. While Frank Vogel and the Lakers staff have wrapped up the spot from the Western Conference and will coach Team LeBron, the spot from the East to lead Team Giannis is still up for grabs, with the deadline Feb. 2. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer is ineligible after coaching last year, and Nurse, who is from Iowa, would like the opportunity. Yeah, Why not? Its close to where I grew up, kind of my second city I grew up in, so yeah, for sure,"" Nurse said. Tremendous honor I think, shows youve had a good start to the season if you can make it. I dont think it probably comes around every year in your coaching life, so yeah, itd be really cool.""","401161314"
"Kawhi Leonard says he isn't bothered he didn't achieve his his first career triple-double until his ninth season, primarily because his focus is on winning games. (1:13) MIAMI --  Kawhi Leonard has two NBA championships, two NBA Finals MVP awards, four All-Star selections and a string of other accolades. And now, one triple-double. Unbelievable as it sounds -- and really, the Miami Heat could not believe it -- Leonard got a triple-double for the first time Friday night. He scored 26 of his 33 points after halftime, finished with 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and carried the Los Angeles Clippers past the Heat 122-117. ""What do you mean, first triple-double? Of his career? Wow,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That is a surprise. He's as complete a player (as there is) in this league."" Leonard actually got the triple-double twice. He had it in the third quarter, briefly: What was originally his 10th rebound was taken away after the stat crew gave one play a closer review. He then got it for real on a rebound with 3:55 remaining. Clippers coach Doc Rivers was given the game ball in the locker room afterward, then dribbled it once before flipping it to Leonard as a keepsake. Leonard raised it over his head, then smiled as teammates applauded. ""It's because of y'all,"" Leonard told teammates. ""Y'all made shots. So that's all a triple-double is."" And even with his big night, the Clippers -- who dug their way out of a 15-point early hole and finished the third quarter on a 15-0 run to take control -- had to hang on in the final moments. Miami was down by 18 with 8:34 left, then went on a 24-9 run and got within three on a 3-pointer by Dion Waiters with 34 seconds remaining. But they got no closer, and Leonard sealed it by going 4 for 4 from the foul line in the final moments. Rivers lauded Leonard for patiently waiting out Miami's trapping schemes. ""It's like he was a boxer,"" Rivers said. ""He just kind of took his time until he could throw punches."" Landry Shamet scored 22 points for the Clippers. Lou Williams had 16 points, Montrezl Harrell added 15 and JaMychal Green 14. Jimmy Butler led Miami with 20 points. Butler left midway through the fourth after appearing to turn his right ankle for the second time in the game, capping a night when he also got inadvertently popped in the eye during the first half. Kelly Olynyk and Tyler Herro scored 19 points each, Bam Adebayo had 18 and Duncan Robinson added 16 for Miami. The Heat fell to 20-2 at home -- 0-2 against teams from Los Angeles. Their only other home loss was to the Lakers. ""We've built a place where it's hard to win here and if you're going to win here you've got to do some extravagant things,"" Adebayo said. ""And they've got a player over there that actually did that tonight."" Leonard flirted with a triple-double on two other occasions this season, missing it by two rebounds on Oct. 26 at Phoenix and by one assist on Nov. 11 against Toronto. ""I thought he already had one,"" Rivers said. The Clippers were without Paul George (left hamstring) for the eighth consecutive game and Patrick Beverley (right groin) for the second straight game, though Beverley tried lobbying his way into the lineup. Miami was without two point guards -- Kendrick Nunn missed the game with left Achilles soreness and Goran Dragic was out with a sore left calf, something that flared up after he got kicked in Wednesday night's overtime win against Washington. So, down to 10 available players, Miami had no choice: Waiters played for the first time this season. Waiters, who had been suspended three times for various issues since October and embarrassed himself and the organization when he ingested at least one cannabis-infused edible and needed medical attention when the team charter plane wrapped up a Phoenix-to-Los Angeles flight in November, played 18 minutes and scored 14 points. ""We need everybody and inevitably during a long NBA season you need everybody to contribute,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's not always necessarily going to be on your terms."" TIP-INS Clippers: Leonard now has a career-best streak of seven 30-point games. World B. Free and Bob McAdoo have the Clippers' record with 11 such consecutive games. ... Patrick Patterson scored 12 for the Clippers. Heat: Adebayo has played in 131 consecutive games, one shy of Grant Long for the fifth-longest streak in franchise history and three away from matching Issac Austin's fourth-best such streak. ... Robinson has made multiple 3-pointers in 15 consecutive games, breaking his own team record. LINEUP ROULETTE The Clippers used their 21st lineup of the season, seven more than they used in the entire 2018-19 regular season. Miami used its sixth different lineup, with Nunn out for the first time. MCGRUDER RETURNS It was the first time Clippers guard Rodney McGruder played against the Heat, the team with whom he spent his first three NBA seasons. He was waived by the Heat late last season in a luxury-tax-related move, and picked up by the Clippers -- who signed him to a three-year deal this past summer. ""He'll have a lifetime recommendation from us. He earned it,"" Spoelstra said.","401161315"
"CHICAGO --  After being pulled from the starting lineup, Buddy Hield proved his value to the Sacramento Kings. Hield scored 21 points, Harrison Barnes added 19 and Sacramento beat the Chicago Bulls 98-81 on Friday night to snap a six-game losing streak. In 23 minutes off the bench, Hield was 7 for 12 from the field -- including 5 of 9 on 3-pointers. ""I've got to give Buddy a lot of love,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""What he did throughout the game, that third quarter when they went on a run, he really kept us in it. ""For him to be all about the team after we took him out of the starting lineup shows a lot, says a lot about him."" Even though Walton tried to make it clear the move wasn't intended to punish the team's leading scorer, Hield acknowledged it was a challenge to view it that way. ""Of course, as a competitor you want to figure out what's the reason for that,"" he said. ""You never get a straight, clear-cut answer. But as a player, as a professional, you have to go in there, lock in and just do it. ""When he calls your number, just produce. That's all you can do."" De'Aaron Fox had 18 points, seven assists and six rebounds as the Kings led virtually wire-to-wire. Zach LaVine scored 21 for the Bulls, who had won four of seven. Chicago was 8 for 37 (21.6%) on 3-pointers. The Bulls played without forward Lauri Markkanen, who will miss four to six weeks with a right hip injury. The 7-footer from Finland had an MRI on Thursday after experiencing soreness for about a week. He had played in all 46 games this season before Friday, averaging 15 points and 6.5 rebounds. Without Markkanen on the court, LaVine was more of a focus for the defense. ""I had to adjust going into the third quarter, but in the first quarter it seemed like I would drive and there would be somebody in the middle, so you swing it,"" said LaVine, who was 8 for 21 from the field. ""I still think I missed some easy ones. I'm used to it."" The Kings used a run of 11 straight points in the second quarter to snap a 33-all tie and take a 54-44 halftime lead. Chicago opened the second half with a 12-2 run to tie the score at 56. Later in the third quarter, Denzel Valentine hit a runner in the lane to put the Bulls on top 69-68 -- their first lead of the game. The Kings, though, scored the final seven points of the period (two layups by Fox and a 3-pointer by Hield) to take a 75-69 edge into the fourth. Sacramento's lead was back up to 85-73 -- matching its biggest to that point -- on a basket by Bogdan Bogdanovic with seven minutes remaining. After taking the lead in the third, Chicago managed just four points in the next seven-plus minutes. Bogdanovic put the game away with a five-point possession for a 92-75 lead with 4 1/2 minutes to go. First, he hit a pair of free throws after LaVine and Bulls coach Jim Boylen were assessed technical fouls. Bogdanovic then hit a 3-pointer. TIP-INS Kings: Hield had started the first 44 games of the season. Bogdanovic started in Hield's place and had 12 points in 26 minutes. Bulls: Markkanen joins a growing list of frontcourt players on the sidelines. Otto Porter Jr. (broken left foot) has been out since early November, Wendell Carter Jr. (sprained right ankle) likely will be out another month and rookie Daniel Gafford has missed the last five games with a dislocated right thumb. ""When it rains it pours, with all of our big men going down,"" said Thaddeus Young, who started in place of Markkanen at power forward. REJECTED The highlight of the first half was a sensational, above-the-rim block by Sacramento's Harry Giles III on a dunk attempt by Shaquille Harrison. ""For me, it was just go and meet him with some force,"" Giles said. PLAYING IT SAFE Markkanen said he had no doubt he could play through the pain at its current level, but understood that doing so could make the injury -- diagnosed as an early stress reaction -- worse. ""I really wanted to play, but at the same time I had to take a step back and think about what was smart,"" he said.","401161316"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  When James Harden went through shooting slumps in the past, the Houston Rockets would be hard-pressed to survive lackluster production from their star guard. With Russell Westbrook, Houston has another player who can shoulder a huge scoring burden. Westbrook scored a season-high 45 points and had 10 assists, and the Rockets overcame another tough night from Harden to rally past the Minnesota Timberwolves 131-124 on Friday night. Westbrook helped key a second-half comeback after Minnesota led by six points in the third quarter. He finished 16-of-27 shooting, was 13 of 13 from the free-throw line and added six rebounds. Eric Gordon scored a season-high 27 points off the bench for Houston, which won its second straight game following a season-long, four-game losing streak. ""That's MVP Russ,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. Harden, who went 1 for 17 from 3-point range in a home loss to Oklahoma City on Monday night, was 3 of 13 overall and 0 for 6 from beyond the arc against Minnesota. He finished with a season-low 12 points. Harden also left the game in the third period after taking a knee from Karl-Anthony Towns to his thigh. He was limping badly but returned in the fourth. Over his past five games, Harden is shooting 33% from the field. ""Guys are playing well, and that's what we need throughout the course of the year,"" Harden said. ""Russ got it going, Eric made some big-time shots. Austin (Rivers) played well. That's what you need. Tonight was just a great team win for us."" According to Stats, it was the second time in Harden's career that he started a game and a teammate outscored him by at least 33 points. The other occasion was Feb. 2, 2011, with the Thunder, when Kevin Durant had 43 points to Harden's seven. Towns had 30 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota, which has lost eight straight. Andrew Wiggins scored 28 points for the Timberwolves. ""We didn't come out with the win, but we fought very well and competed very well,"" Towns said. ""We did a lot of good things defensively, actually, doing a lot of good things and sticking to our game plan. Russell hit some big shots. He was MVP for a reason, and in the fourth quarter he hit some really big shots, especially in the second half."" After Wednesday's 117-110 loss at Chicago, Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said the team is simply not playing well. Saunders also challenged Wiggins at halftime of that game to be more productive. The Wolves started strong while Houston was missing shots. Minnesota led by six in the opening quarter. The Rockets hit just two of their first 11 shots and Harden was 1 of 5. The Rockets also trailed in Minnesota in November before recovering for a 125-105 win. Led by Westbrook, Houston led by as many as 13 on Friday, but the Wolves didn't fade. Minnesota cut the Rockets' lead to 110-108 with 6 minutes remaining. Houston had the finisher in Westbrook. He scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, including 11 after the Wolves closed within two. ""There's a reason Russell Westbrook and James Harden are who they are, and why that team is so dangerous,"" Saunders said. ""If one guy has a night where he's not reaching his average, you have another guy who can pick up the scoring load. I liked a lot of things tonight. The effort. Obviously did not like the outcome."" WESTBROOK'S BURST Westbrook has averaged 33.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 9.1 assists over the last seven games. His season-high scoring output came without him attempting a 3-pointer. He is the first guard since Dwyane Wade in 2007 to score at least 45 points without a 3-point try. ""I was only taking shots I wanted to take,"" Westbrook said. ""That's me just maturing in this game and figuring out my spots and shooting the ball when I'm ready to."" RUNNING WOLVES The Wolves emphasized getting out on the break more against Houston, and responded with 18 fast-break points. ""And I don't think we were playing fast enough,"" Saunders said. ""The way we were getting some of the 18 fast-break points were the ways we want to get them."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston scored 23 points off 17 Minnesota turnovers. ... The Rockets only had 10 turnovers, leading to 13 points for the Wolves. ... Westbrook is averaging 26.8 points per game this season. No teammate has averaged more than 18.6 points per game in any of Harden's seven seasons with Houston. Timberwolves: Josh Okogie started in place of rookie Jarrett Culver, in part for matching up against Harden. Okogie finished with 17 points. ... Starting PG Shabazz Napier left the game late in the second quarter, limping off the court. He returned for the second half and had nine points, five rebounds and five assists. ... Minnesota outrebounded Houston 52-34. The Wolves grabbed 36 rebounds in the first half, tied for the second most all-time franchise history for a half. They had 36 in the first half against Memphis on April 12, 2008.","401161317"
"Zion Williamson admits that it will take at least a few games to get used to the pace of an NBA game. (1:14) NEW ORLEANS --  With Nikola Jokic and Jerami Grant aggressively crashing the offensive glass, the Denver Nuggets were able to overcome an off night shooting on the road for an unusual but gratifying victory. Jokic had 27 points and grabbed seven of his 12 rebounds on the offensive end and the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Pelicans 113-106 on Friday night. Not only did the Nuggets win while shooting below 40%, but they also played most of the second half without coach Michael Malone on the sideline after he received two quick technical fouls from official Eric Lewis with 9:10 left in the third quarter. ""Obviously. I have to do a better job of being a leader and controlling those competitive emotions, but I always feel it's also necessary to fight for your guys, to stand up for your guys,"" said Malone, who received his initial technical for arguing a foul called against Grant and the second for his reaction to the first. ""I was just proud of the fact that they were able to pull this one out."" Zion Williamson scored 15 points in about 21 minutes for New Orleans. The Pelicans dropped to 0-2 since the NBA's top overall draft choice was activated for the first time this season Wednesday night following more than three months rehabilitating from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. While the Pelicans have thus far restricted Williamson's playing time, he looked healthy when he dunked an alley-oop feed from Holiday and vaulted his 6-foot-6, 285-pound frame skyward to swat Malik Beasley's 8-foot floating jumper several rows back in the stands. ""My conditioning was a lot better even though it's only been one game and I feel like I'm getting my chemistry back with my teammates,"" Williamson said. ""I feel like I played all right."" Denver finished with season highs of 24 offensive rebounds and 35 second-chance points. ""The stat that jumps out to me is the rebounding,"" Malone said. ""The fact that we were able to pull this out playing hard and getting contributions from so many people is great to watch."" Grant grabbed six of his nine rebounds on the offensive end and had 14 points. Torrey Graig and Michael Porter Jr. each had three offensive rebounds. Porter Jr. and Craig each had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Denver. The Nuggets improved to 3-2 since guard Jamal Murray went out with a left ankle sprain. Denver led for most of the game and by as many as 15 points. The Pelicans were as close as 109-106 on Josh Hart's 3 with 1:19 remaining when rebounding problems that plagued them throughout the game struck again on Jokic's missed 3. Will Barton grabbed Denver's final offensive rebound and hit a driving layup with 48.7 seconds left. ""I don't think we wanted it enough tonight,"" Williamson said. ""It wasn't really difficult dealing with their size. It was a matter of finding a man and boxing him out. Simple as that."" The Pelicans outshot Denver 46.3% to 37.7%, but committed 17 turnovers and missed 12 free throws. The Nuggets outrebounded New Orleans 56-45. The Nuggets' offensive rebounding gave them 106 shot attempts to New Orleans' 82. JJ Redick scored 18 points for New Orleans and Hart finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench. TIP-INS Nuggets: Will Barton scored 13 points, while Monte Morris and Malik Beasley each added 10 points in reserve roles. ... Denver improved to 21-3 when outrebounding its opponent. ... Malone's ejection was his first this season. Pelicans: Brandon Ingram scored 13 points but missed 8 of 11 shots. ... Holiday had 12 points but missed 12 of 17 shots. ... E'Twaun Moore scored 10 points in 14:28 off the bench. ... Redick now has 1,832 career 3-pointers, passing Kobe Bryant for 15th and Chauncey Billups for 14th in NBA history. WILLIAMSON'S ENCORE The Pelicans outscored Denver by 16 when Williamson was in the game. He soared to the hoop for a crowd-pleasing finger roll in which he flamboyantly transferred the ball from his right hand to his left before shooting. His layup, 9-foot turnaround from the lane and three rebounds helped fuel a 14-2 run that gave New Orleans a brief, 72-70 lead in the third quarter. Williamson was subbed out for the final time with 6:52 left in the game and fans chanted, ""We want Zion,"" during the final minutes as the Pelicans tried to come back. Williamson said whether he starts or finishes a quarter, ""hasn't really been up to me. I'm just playing whenever they need me.""","401161318"

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and Dennis Schroder added 21 for the Thunder, who shot 58% from the field and posted a season-high point total. It was another positive step for one of the league's surprise teams. ""Sometimes those kinds of underdog-type teams -- there is not really one main guy, there's a lot of guys that really gel together,"" Atlanta guard Trae Young said. ""Their chemistry's great. They just play well off of each other, and that's what I think they have here."" Young, who was named an All-Star starter on Thursday, had 26 points and a season-high 16 assists. John Collins scored 28 points and Cam Reddish 20 for the Hawks. Young grew up in Norman, Oklahoma, and played a season of college ball at the University of Oklahoma, about a 30-minute drive south of Chesapeake Energy Arena. He grew up a Thunder fan, and he made a special effort to connect with their fans on Friday. ""It feels good,"" Young said. ""I was that kid coming back when there was 90 minutes on the clock as soon as the doors open and try to get down there and watch players warm up. So for me, working out with 90 minutes on the clock and then being back home, I just wanted to sign as many autographs as I could."" He was greeted warmly by those fans during pregame introductions. ""What's the coolest part, too, is to see the way the fans went crazy for him when they heard his name, as they should,"" Thunder guard Chris Paul said. ""He's homegrown. Mr. Oklahoma, and he deserves it, and to be in the All Star game as a starter is unbelievable."" Young's shot was cold early. The league's No. 3 scorer went scoreless until he made a free throw with 5:33 left in the second quarter. His first field goal came with 4:11 left in the second. The Thunder led 66-58 at halftime. Young scored 11 points on 2-of-10 shooting before the break, and had eight assists. The Thunder extended their lead to 104-90 by the end of the third quarter, and the game was never close in the fourth. Oklahoma City's largest lead was 33 points. ""We picked up our defense, especially in the fourth quarter,"" Paul said. ""Our coach got on us at halftime about our defense and intensity and he was right. You know that team right there, even though their record isn't that great, they beat some really good teams because you let them hang around. They are NBA players just like us, so we picked up our defense, and I think that sparked our offense also.""

"SAN ANTONIO --  Devin Booker let his teammates and coaches know just how tired he was of losing to San Antonio. When the Phoenix guard wasnt jawing at the opposition, Booker was encouraging his teammates to fight and imploring his coaches to protest every call that went against the Suns. Booker did his part, scoring 35 points before fouling out and the Suns held on to beat the Spurs 103-99 on Friday night, snapping an 11-game skid in San Antonio. He was wanting me to challenge every call, Suns coach Monty Williams said while chuckling. Im like, Dude, I only got one. But I thought that was what helped us, his will. Hes lost here a lot and he wanted this one bad. We wanted it bad. Booker has scored at least 30 points eight times in January and is averaging 31.3 points in 12 games this month. He has scored more than 35 points in six other games in January, but Fridays output was the most satisfying. I said it at the end of the third to start the fourth: Were not leaving here without a victory, Booker said. We wanted this one bad. Phoenix won in San Antonio for the first time since Feb. 27, 2013. The Spurs rallied in the fourth, cutting the Suns lead to 94-93 on a pair of free throws by Derrick White following Bookers fifth foul with 3:52 remaining. Booker responded with a jumper over White on the ensuing possession before fouling out with 1:31 remaining. Dario Sarics follow of a missed shot put Phoenix up 100-96 with a minute remaining over a smaller lineup and snap San Antonios three-game winning streak. It wasnt plays, it wasnt necessarily schemes, it was just a lot of heart and competitive intensity on both ends, Williams said. DeMar DeRozan had 30 points and eight rebounds for San Antonio, which had won six of nine entering their second game of the season against Phoenix. LaMarcus Aldridge (16 points) and Derrick White (13) were the only other Spurs to score in double figures. Saric had 20 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 16 and Deandre Ayton had 10 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Phoenix outscored San Antonio 23-7 to open the second quarter. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich called two timeouts in a matter of minutes in a failed attempt to stem the momentum. Second quarter was a killer, Popovich said. I thought their physicality, they got up into us in the second quarter. We had seven turnovers and that really kicked us. The Spurs would score six straight points to pull within nine at 53-44, but Booker drained a 25-foot 3-pointer to put the Suns up 56-44 at the half. Booker scored 11 points on 4-for-7 shooting in the quarter. Every night he has that kind of game, Saric said. I think hes just unbelievable how he can score and hes still young. Hes an unbelievable scorer, and he can pass, too. I dont know what to say, hes amazing. It was the second time this season the Suns held the Spurs to 16 points in the second quarter, also doing so Dec. 14. In that second quarter, we tried to impose our will on the game, Booker said. TIP-INS Suns: Williams, a former Spurs player, executive and assistant, received a warm ovation when he was introduced before the game. Williams played for San Antonio from 1996-98, was a coaching staff intern in 2005 and returned to serve as the teams vice president of basketball operations in 2017 and '18. ... Phoenix was plus-18 in the second quarter, its third highest differential in any quarter this season. Spurs: Mills has made 100 3-pointers in a season for the sixth time with the Spurs, second only to Danny Greens seven seasons. ... DeMarre Carroll was inactive, wearing a purple suit with white stripes as he sat behind the Spurs bench. Carroll has played in only 15 games this season since signing as a free agent in the offseason.  Phoenix held San Antonio to 16 points in the second quarter Dec. 14, but the Spurs won that game in overtime, 121-119. NICE FEELING Booker smiled when asked how it feels to quiet a raucous crowd on the road with a 3-pointer. Its a good feeling, he said. Its a good feeling. Booker finished 11 for 20 overall and 3 for 7 on 3-pointers in 41 minutes.","401161320"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Golden State's plan to double-team Domantas Sabonis in the post allowed Indiana's big man to show off his passing skills and gave the Pacers plenty of open looks from the perimeter. Sabonis nearly got his second triple-double in six days, too. Sabonis had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, T.J. Warren scored 21 of his 33 points in the first half and the Pacers beat the Warriors 129-118 on Friday night. ""We just needed to be patient, space the floor and get the ball out. Domas did a really good job in the post,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""When they sent the double-team he did a good job getting that ball out and our guys on the weak side were able to knock down shots."" Doug McDermott was one of the primary beneficiaries of Sabonis' passing. McDermott made four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and matched his season high with 24 points as the Pacers (30-16) won their seventh in eight games. T.J. McConnell and Aaron Holiday scored 12 apiece. ""It's great to have a player like that because Domas has really great vision and he's always looking to pass,"" McDermott said. ""He's a very unselfish player, so he's fun to play with. He sets screens and it's really a shooter's dream."" Sabonis brushed off his night as nothing more than adjusting to what the Warriors were doing defensively. ""In the second half they started collapsing more and more, not letting us roll to the basket easily or in the post,"" Sabonis said. ""I just tried to find my teammates for open shots."" D'Angelo Russell had 37 points for Golden State. The Warriors lost for the 13th time in 14 games and fell to an NBA-worst 10-37. ""Sabonis puts a lot of pressure on you,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's a really good dive man off the pick-and-roll. He's a handful in there."" Golden State was working to complete a trade with Dallas that would send Willie Cauley-Stein to the Mavericks in exchange for a second-round draft pick. The deal will reportedly be finalized when Dallas makes room on its roster for the 7-foot Cauley-Stein. The Pacers held a 56-28 advantage in the paint, scored 33 points off 20 Warriors turnovers and got steady production from the bench to beat Golden State for the fourth time in 11 games. It didn't come easily for McMillan's squad. Indiana let most of a 16-point halftime lead slip away in the third quarter, then nearly blew another big lead in the fourth before pulling away. After Eric Paschall's two free throws got Golden State to 121-115, Aaron Holiday -- who made back-to-back 3s late in the third quarter -- hit his third and Warren later added another 3-pointer to make it 129-118. Sabonis gave the Pacers a scare when he went down after taking an elbow to the lower stomach early in the third quarter just as a timeout was called. Sabonis stayed down for several moments, then walked off the court before pausing near the scorer's table to rub his head. ""It knocked the air out of me,"" Sabonis said. TIP-INS Pacers: Warren was called for a technical foul after scoring in the third quarter. . Sabonis had four steals by halftime to match his previous career high. Warriors: With Cauley-Stein out because of the pending trade and Kevon Looney sitting out because of abdominal soreness, Marquese Chriss started at center had 13 points with three rebounds. . Russell was hit with a technical foul in the second quarter. . Injured starts Stephen Curry (hand) and Klay Thompson (knee) will be re-evaluated in early February.","401161321"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Once again, Rudy Gobert was there to clean up the mess. On the final few possessions, the two-time Defensive Player of the Year made a tip-in, blocked a layup just before it hit the glass, got a key rebound and made a free throw. In all, Gobert had 22 points, 17 rebounds and five blocks to propel the surging Utah Jazz to a 112-107 come-from-behind victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday. ""Obviously, we weren't perfect but Rudy cleans up a lot of our mistakes,"" teammate Donovan Mitchell said. ""He's always there for us."" Mitchell scored 25 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 23 for the Jazz, who have won 14 of their last 15 games. Luka Doncic scored 25 points for the Mavericks, who have dropped two of three after winning four straight. Seth Curry added 19 points for Dallas. Doncic managed only two points in the final quarter. ""Any team is going to do anything possible to make it hard on (Luka) down the stretch. I'll look at it. I've got to do a better job of getting him in better situations,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Gobert's three-point play -- a dunk and a free throw -- gave the Jazz their first lead since the first half at 96-95. The Mavericks responded with a 3 by Curry and two free throws from Delon Wright. Gobert broke a 104-all tie with a tip-in, and after Tim Hardaway Jr. and Royce O'Neale exchanged 3-pointers, Gobert blocked what looked like an easy layup for Wright. ""It was impressive,"" Mitchell said. ""I'm convinced he let guys lay it up at the beginning of the game so he could block it late."" Mitchell made a pair of free throws, and then Gobert rebounded Doncic's missed 3-pointer and was fouled. He made one of two free throws for the final margin. With a performance like that, the crowd had good reason for chanting Gobert's name. ""It was amazing . the energy was almost like a playoff atmosphere,"" Gobert said. ""But just winning is my number one thing."" The Mavericks raced to a 32-19 lead behind Doncic's playmaking and shooting. The Jazz later scored 12 consecutive points and took a brief 37-36 lead on Georges Niang's 3-pointer. Kristaps Porzingis scored 15 points and Hardaway and Wright each chipped in 11 for Dallas. ""I think we did a good job today, especially here where it's tough to play. We had a lot of open shots down the stretch. We just didn't hit them,"" Doncic said. MUST-SEE TV IN EUROPE The early start (3 p.m. MST) gave NBA fans in Europe a chance to see a game with some of their favorite players without staying up all night. Key Jazz players like Gobert and Bogdanovic, as well as Dallas stars such as Porzingis and Doncic, said they had a number of family and friends at home watching this one live. ""It's great for the game. There are so many kids and adults who love the game of basketball in Europe and they didn't need to start watching at 3 in the morning,"" Gobert said. Bogdanovic added: ""Oh yeah, today was like a prime time game for Europe. I had lots of friends watching and it makes a big difference to have it more accessible."" MAVS TRADE FOR CAULEY-STEIN The Mavericks completed a trade to acquire 7-foot center Willie Cauley-Stein from Golden State for a second-round draft pick. Dallas needed help after center Dwight Powell tore his right Achilles tendon. ""Well, he's going to give us depth. That's one thing we desperately need with Powell being out,"" Carlisle said before the game. ""We'll give him the crash course and try to simplify things for him initially.""

"DETROIT --  Kyrie Irving took over, scoring on an array of shots and even over a backboard that was simply in his way. Irving scored 17 of his 45 points in the third quarter to overcome a double-digit deficit and the Brooklyn Nets went on to beat the Detroit Pistons 121-111 in overtime Saturday night. ""It was about time,"" Irving said. The six-time All-Star played in his sixth game after a 26-game absence due to an injured right shoulder, which he was treating shortly after his sensational performance. At one point during Irving's scoring tear after halftime, he shot a floater over 6-foot-11 Andre Drummond and the backboard from the baseline. ""It just came down to execution and Kyrie having an out-of-body experience,"" Drummond said. ""When he's knocking down shots like that, it is kind of tough to do anything against him. Irving made free throws early in the extra period to put the Nets ahead and his assists helped them end a five-game losing streak. ""The way we've been struggling it's big for us,"" Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie said. The Nets went ahead 106-104 with 38.4 seconds left in regulation when Drummond was called for goaltending. Derrick Rose had an unforced turnover on the ensuing possession, then made up for it with a tying layup with 1.9 seconds left. Irving missed a 3-pointer just before the buzzer, sending it to overtime. ""We worked really hard, but it came down to a couple possessions at the end of regulation,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""I thought we ran out of gas a little in overtime."" The Nets and Pistons are among many sub-.500 teams in the Eastern Conference, likely vying for the last two spots in the playoffs. Brooklyn's Jarrett Allen finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds, and Joe Harris scored 16 points. Nicolas Claxton had 10 points, and Dinwiddie added 10 points off the bench. Rose had 27 points for Detroit, scoring more than 20 for the 12th straight game to extend his career high. Drummond had a double-double in the first quarter and finished with 20 points and 21 rebounds. He has an NBA-high eight games with 20 or more points and rebounds and 40 in his career, tying Bob Lanier's franchise record. It was an impressive performance after missing two games for dental surgery. ""It was a tough week,"" Drummond said. ""I've got a fake tooth in there now and I've still got a lot of (dental) work left ahead of me. Drummond had 11 points and 10 rebounds in the first quarter, which ended with the Nets ahead 26-25. Irving was dominant in the third quarter, scoring eight consecutive points in the game and a total of 12 points in 2:02. ""Kyrie set the tone in the first two possessions the second half, he went to the rim, got fouled scored a layup,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It loosened the defense up."" Irving's scoring surge helped the Nets go into the fourth quarter with an 80-77 lead. ""It definitely jump-started our team,"" Dinwiddie said. ""He really kicked into high gear and basically said we weren't going to lose the game."" TIP-INS Nets: Garrett Temple moved into the starting lineup, ending Dinwiddie's streak of 32 straight starts. The move sets up Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert to provide the scoring off the bench. ... DeAndre Jordan (finger) missed a fourth straight game and is day to day. ...

"CLEVELAND --  Zach LaVine fell just short of a perfect night Saturday. LaVine scored 44 points and the Chicago Bulls defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 118-106. The 6-foot-5 guard also finished with 10 rebounds and eight assists, barely missing his first career triple-double. ""I haven't had one before, so when it got to the last two minutes, I was thinking maybe I could get those two assists,"" LaVine said. ""It's all right. I'll get one eventually."" LaVine did everything else. He made 16 of 30 shots and had 27 points at halftime. LaVine drove past his defender for clear looks at the basket, scored when he was double-teamed in the lane, hit five 3-pointers and was 7 of 8 from the line. ""Zach LaVine was just unbelievable -- driving, shooting, making back-door cuts -- he did it in every way,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. LaVine scored 42 points on Jan. 20, including 21 in the fourth quarter when the Bulls rallied from a 15-point deficit to win. Cleveland, which has lost seven straight and 12 of 14, had no better success stopping LaVine this time. ""We've tried everything now,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said.. ""He challenges people. None of it's worked against LaVine."" LaVine scored a career-high 49 points against Charlotte on Nov. 23, a total he had a good chance to surpass for most of the game. ""I wanted to come out more aggressive tonight,"" he said. ""When you get a team on their heels, you can pick up the (offensive) pressure even more."" LaVine was held to 16 points when the Cavaliers beat the Bulls in Cleveland on Oct. 30. The teams play for the fourth and final time this season in Chicago on March 10. Tomas Satoransky had 19 points for the Bulls, who were coming off a home loss to Sacramento on Friday and arrived around 1:30 a.m. Kevin Love scored 20 points and had 11 rebounds for Cleveland. Collin Sexton and Cedi Osman each had 18 points. The game was tied at 69 midway through the third quarter before the Bulls went on a 30-7 run to go ahead 99-76. Chicago outscored Cleveland 40-19 in the period. Cleveland cut a 24-point deficit to 112-103 with two minutes to play, but got no closer. ""We were desperate,"" Love said. ""We have to have that sense of urgency the entire game. ""When we don't have that you see we get down double digits."" The Cavaliers had lopsided home losses to New York and Washington this week. TIP-INS Bulls: C Wendell Carter Jr. (sprained right ankle) and Otto Porter Jr. (broken left foot) have been ruled out through the All-Star break. ... Satoransky avoided injury after being hit in the face by teammate Luke Kornet's shoulder in the third quarter.

The call resulted in a technical since the Cavaliers had a delay of game in the first quarter, but Ryan Arcidiacono missed the free throw. ... Newly hired Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski attended the game and was given a loud ovation when shown on the video board.

Osman donated $200 for each 3-pointer made by the two teams, a total matched by teammate Larry Nance Jr. The Bulls and Cavaliers combined to hit 25 3-pointers. ""It's not in my hometown -- it happened in a different city,"" Osman said. ""I wish I could be there with those people, but at least I felt like I had do something to help.""

"MINNEAPOLIS --  With veterans banged up, Oklahoma Citys young players are gaining valuable experience and learning how to win on the road. Having Chris Paul around to stabilize things certainly helps, too. Paul scored 25 points and hit timely shots to deflate Minnesotas runs, and Dennis Schroder had a team-high 26 points off the bench to lead the Thunder to their fifth straight win, 113-104 over the slumping Timberwolves on Saturday night. Since December, the Thunder have gone 12-3 on the road and have won five consecutive games away from Chesapeake Energy Arena. Their bench played well again, outscoring Minnesotas reserves 52-20. That was especially big considering Nerlens Noel was out with a fractured cheek bone, and Steven Adams wasnt quite at full strength after missing two games due to injury. I thought being somewhat short-handed and Steven probably not all the way back physically, the job those guys did on the road to find a way to win was really, really great, coach Billy Donovan said. Oklahoma City had seven players in double figures, including 15 points from Darius Bazley and 11 from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Young guys amazing once again, Paul said. We came out, I think we were nine, 10 strong. Paul had 10 points during a 31-12 run that appeared to give the Thunder control in the third. The Wolves managed to climb back late. Robert Covington's 3-pointer with 1:07 to play made it 109-104, but Paul answered with a floater in the lane and Schroder added a pair of free-throws to put the game out of reach. He has so much experience, Mike Muscala, who had 11 points off the bench, said of Paul. He knows his spots. He knows how to keep the ball moving. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 37 for the Timberwolves, who cut a 20-point deficit to five in the final minutes but lost their ninth in a row. The All-Star center has scored 30 points in three straight games for the second time in his career, but saw uneven production from his teammates. The league is what it is, Towns said. Theyre going to kick when youre down, and theyre going to keep kicking you until you get it. Weve got to get up. REELING WOLVES Andrew Wiggins scored 22 for Minnesota, and Shabazz Napier had his first-career triple-double with 10 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds. Not that Napier was in any mood to celebrate afterward. I dont care about that man, I could care less, he said. Ive said this a million times, to many people, I could go in a game and throw a thousand turnovers, as long as we win. KAT ADJUSTMENTS The Thunder withstood an early push from Towns, who scored 19 of Minnesotas first 20 points. We did a better job of crowding the floor on him and at least putting some people around him where he didn't have so much room to operate, Donovan said. Schroder came off the bench to score 10 in the period to steadily push the Thunder past the Wolves, who failed to find any early offense when Towns took a rest. The rest of the team went 1 for 13 from the floor in the first quarter. TIP INS Thunder: Adams played 23 minutes in his return to the lineup after missing two games with a sprained left ankle. Adams was held scoreless, yet provided a big body to harass Towns.  The team said Noel underwent a successful procedure to repair a fractured left cheek, and that his status would be updated next week. Noel, whos averaging 8.2 points and 5.2 rebounds, sustained the injury Friday night against Atlanta.  F Danilo Gallinari was also out with a sore left thumb injured Friday night. Timberwolves: G Allen Crabbe limped to the locker room with a left knee injury after a hard fall in the first quarter. He did not return. ... Rookie Jarrett Culver was back in the starting lineup a night after Josh Okogie started in the back court to guard Houstons James Harden.

"LeBron James and Kobe Bryant reflect on their unique relationship over the years on and off the court. (1:30) PHILADELPHIA --  LeBron James was a teenager when he first met Kobe Bryant at a youth basketball camp, in awe of his idol and ears open as the Los Angeles Lakers star offered advice to the prodigy that has lasted to this day. ""I was just listening,"" James said. ""I was just trying to soak everything up I could. I remember one thing he said was that if you want to try and be great at it, and want to be one of the greats, you've got to put the work in."" James put in the work and followed Bryant's path -- from making the leap from high school straight to the NBA, to winning NBA titles, and, eventually, to playing in Los Angeles. With a driving right-handed layup, James no longer chased Bryant, he zoomed past him for third place on the NBA's career scoring list. ""I'm just happy to be in any conversation with Kobe Bryant, one of the all-time greats to ever play,"" James said. With a tribute to Bryant written on his Nikes, James scored 29 points in front of a roaring 76ers' crowd, but the Lakers fell short in a 108-91 loss to Philadelphia on Saturday night. James scribbled ""Mamba 4 Life"" as he chased Bryant, the five-time champion, in Philly. Fans stood with phones pointed toward the court, waiting to capture a slice of history that came when James scored the milestone basket with 7:23 left in the third quarter. James entered 18 points shy of passing Bryant, and the layup gave him 33,644 points. James stands third with 33,655. Bryant finished his career with 33,643, all with the Lakers. ""Continuing to move the game forward (at)KingJames. Much respect my brother (hash)33644,"" Bryant tweeted. James waved to the Philadelphia crowd that gave him a rousing standing ovation when the mark was announced by the public address announcer. The Sixers also posted a graphic of the NBA's top 10 career scorers with images of James in Lakers and Miami Heat jerseys. The 35-year-old James entered averaging at least 25 points (25.2 ppg) for the 16th straight season and has played 44 games this season. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the NBA's career scoring leader with 38,387 points and Karl Malone is second at 36,928. James is on pace to pass Abdul-Jabbar in about three seasons. The top four scorers in NBA history played for the Lakers, who signed James as a free agent in 2018. James passed Bryant in Philadelphia, where the retired Lakers star was born. James, who played in eight consecutive NBA Finals, has 6,911 postseason points with Cleveland and Miami that do not count in the official total. James' stories in the locker room on Bryant seemed to stretch on as long as his list of milestones. Like another time when he was still in high school and was gifted a pair of red, white and blue Nikes from Bryant. James wore a size 15, Bryant was a 14, but he wore the sneaks anyway. Or the way James was inspired how Bryant always found some sort of slight to use as fuel to improve. James would have a ""dream come true"" when he lined up side-by-side with Bryant as teammates in the 2008 Olympics as part of the ""Redeem Team"" and led Team USA to a gold medal in Beijing. ""There's just too much. The story is just too much,"" James said. ""The story doesn't make sense. Make a long story short, now I'm here in a Lakers uniform, in Philadelphia where he's from."" Anthony Davis scored 31 points for the Lakers. James went 9 for 18 from the floor, missed five of six 3s, made 10 of 13 free throws and had eight turnovers. ""It was just a great historic moment for our franchise, for LeBron himself,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. 76ERS ROLL Ben Simmons had 28 points and 10 rebounds and Tobias Harris scored 29 points. The Sixers improved to 6-3 since they lost All-Star center Joel Embiid with a torn ligament on a finger in his left hand. Embiid hoped to return as soon as next week. The Sixers led by 22 and watched that lead shrink to five in the fourth quarter. Al Horford, the underachieving free agent pickup, buried a 3 that pushed the lead back to 10 and had the packed crowd rocking. Horford hit a mid-range jumper and Simmons, who lost a tooth at some point in the first half, scored on a layup that gave the 76ers needed breathing room to seal the win. ""I felt like we might be able to get some separation on Al Horford and we did,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""The game was kind of fragile at that point."" TIP-INS Lakers: JaVale McGee missed a second straight game with flu-like symptoms. Sixers: G Josh Richardson sat out again with a strained left hamstring. ... G Zhaire Smith, called up from G League with Richardson out, left his first game of the season with a sprained left ankle. ...

"Allen Iverson joins The Jump and defends James Harden, saying his offensive style should be praised, not criticized. (1:57) DENVER --  Colorado was the epicenter of Kobe Bryant's worst moment, but even in Denver, in a building where he was frequently booed, there were tears and stunned silence. It started with a moment of silence for the NBA great, who was killed in a helicopter crash about an hour before the game, and led to chants of ""Kobe! Kobe! Kobe!"" The game became secondary on this melancholy Sunday at Pepsi Center as the Denver Nuggets held off the Houston Rockets 117-110. ""I've got to be honest, it wasn't on my mind when we lost, us losing the game,"" Rockets guard Austin Rivers said. ""This pain is not going to go away anytime soon. You don't even have to be a basketball fan to feel this."" In 2003, Bryant was charged with sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort. He had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court. Bryant's adulation remained strong in Los Angeles even amid the allegations. But not so much in Denver, where, for years, his every appearance was met with lusty boos from fans who heard more about Bryant's case than those in other NBA towns. All afternoon, the mood was somber. A few of the Denver players sat at their lockers before the game, staring at their phones in disbelief with the details of Bryant's death starting to emerge. The 41-year-old Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were among the nine people killed in the crash near Calabasas, California, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Houston players Tyson Chandler and P.J. Tucker were visibly upset during the tribute, while Rivers covered his eyes with his arm. Rivers also had a tribute to Bryant on his shoes. So did Tucker, who wrote, ""There will never be another."" ""This is beyond tough. I don't have the words,"" Tucker said. ""There will never be another person like him. Still trying to process it. ... I don't even really remember much from the game. I'm sorry. Just didn't mean a whole lot now."" Nikola Jokic said he got goosebumps when he heard of Bryant's death. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Jokic, who finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for his ninth triple-double of the season. ""He's not just a legend here, he's a legend across the world. We lost a huge person, a role model. It's a huge loss for everybody."" Jokic gave everything in honor of the player nicknamed Black Mamba. ""When you think about Kobe it's, `No excuse. Nothing can put your mind off what you love to do,"" Jokic said. ""It's the Mamba mentality, for sure."" Like many around the league, Jerami Grant called Bryant his favorite player growing up. ""Watching everything he did on the court, off the court, the way he carried himself,"" said Grant, who scored a season-high 25 points. ""It's extremely tough."" The first half remained a complete blur for Michael Porter Jr. as he processed his feelings. He remembered meeting Bryant at a Nike camp, when the superstar offered him encouragement. ""We all look up to him,"" said Porter, who scored 17 points to help the Nuggets even the season series with Houston at two apiece. ""I didn't think it was real."" Russell Westbrook scored 22 of his 32 points in the second half. Eric Gordon added 19 points and Ben McLemore scored 15 in the absence of leading scorer James Harden, who sat out with a bruised left thigh. Once the final horn sounded, reality of Bryant's death set back in. ""It's devastating. This one hurt to the core,"" Gordon said. ""To hear news like that before the game, it was tough to stay focused. It's tough to hear news like that before the game -- a guy you admire, a guy you looked up to."" TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook had 10 turnovers. ... Clint Capela grabbed 12 rebounds. Nuggets: It was Jokic's 37th career triple-double. ... Morris finished with 17. ... The Nuggets were without Jamal Murray (left ankle sprain), Paul Millsap (bruised left knee) and Mason Plumlee (right foot). DIFFERENT STORY Rockies All-Star shortstop Trevor Story drained the pregame free throw while wearing a pair of Kobe Bryant shoes. Story has always been a big fan of Bryant. ""The way he played the game was so inspiring to me,"" Story said. ""The Mamba mentality, you try to mimic that. The intensity he played with was so special.""","401161327"
"Demar DeRozan says he wouldn't be the player that he is without Kobe Bryant. (1:36) SAN ANTONIO --  The Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs did not want to be on the court after learning Kobe Bryant had died, but they tried to honor him as best they could. The teams collaborated on a touching tribute to Bryant at the beginning of their game Sunday, with each team dribbling out the 24-second shot clock  in remembrance of the No. 24 worn by the retired NBA great, who died in a helicopter crash at age 41. Pascal Siakam scored 35 points to lead the Raptors past the Spurs 110-106 on a day when many players' thoughts were elsewhere.

The rest is irrelevant right now."" Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were among the nine people killed when the helicopter they were riding in crashed in Calabasas, California. The teams found out about Bryant's death about an hour before the afternoon tipoff. ""Everybody is pretty emotional about the tragedy with Kobe,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""All of us know what a great player he was, but he went beyond great playing, he was a competitor, that goes unmatched. It's what made him as a player so attractive to everybody, that focus, that competitiveness, that will to win. And even more importantly than that, we all feel a deep sense of loss for what he meant to all of us in so many ways and so many millions of people loved him for so many different reasons. It's just a tragic thing. There are no words that can describe how everybody feels about it. We are all thinking about the family and the process that they're going to be going through now. That's where all our thoughts should be."" The Spurs had many battles with Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, especially in the playoffs. Popovich has spoken about his love for and respect of Bryant, and that admiration was apparent when the team played a tribute video during the legend's final appearance in San Antonio. ""An assassin in the best sense of that word,"" Spurs legend David Robinson said. ""Someone you knew was going to get the job done. You felt like it was almost inevitable if you're playing against him. You cannot let him get that shot. Just the work ethic and the intensity, everything you bring to a game, everything that elevates this game."" San Antonio held a moment of silence before the game. Spurs assistant coaches Becky Hammon and Tim Duncan and guard Lonnie Walker IV were visibly upset. Hammon and Walker wiped away tears and Duncan had his hands over his face. DeMar DeRozan, who scored 14 points, consoled Walker even as he battled his own emotions. DeRozan, who was raised in Compton, California, was a fan of Bryant growing up and became close friends with him. ""Everything. Everything,"" DeRozan said when asked what Bryant meant to him. ""Everything I've learned came from Kobe, everything. Take Kobe away, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have love, I wouldn't have the passion, the drive. Everything came from him."" After the moment of silence came the memorable in-game tribute. The teams did not contest the opening tipoff. Instead, Toronto point guard Fred VanVleet held onto the ball for 24 seconds, incurring a shot-clock violation. San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray did the same as the crowd gave a standing ovation and chanted, ""Kobe! Kobe!"" Popovich was not his usual animated self on the sidelines as the Raptors raced to a 29-12 lead. But when Walker missed a defensive assignment on one of Siakam's five 3-pointers, Popovich pulled Walker immediately from the game and had the second-year guard sit by him as he scolded him and then immediately reinserted him into the lineup. The Spurs also returned to life, outscoring the Raptors 34-23 in the third quarter after trailing by as many as 19 points in the first half. Gasol scored eight straight points, helping Toronto tie the game at 97. VanVleet scored the Raptors' final five points, including a 3-pointer, to help Toronto win its seventh straight game. ""I was happy to give our team a lead there and make two free throws and try to get out of here and get home and kiss on my babies,"" VanVleet said. INTERNATIONAL APPEAL Robinson said one of the things that made Bryant so special was his ability to connect with fans around the world. ""He had an appeal worldwide,"" Robinson said. ""He was a very international player. Spoke (different) languages, played all over the world. I think he was very relatable. Obviously, he elevated the game. I come from the Magic (Johnson) and Larry Bird era, where it began to get to be an international game and Kobe was kind of the next link in that chain and did an unbelievable job."" Bryant spoke Spanish and Italian after spending part of his youth in Europe while his father, Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, played pro basketball in Italy. Bryant used that proficiency to his advantage on the court, too, speaking in Spanish to trash-talk then Spurs rookie Manu Ginobili during his first game against the Lakers. TIP-INS Raptors: Kyle Lowry, who had 16 points, did not talk to the media following the game because he was saddened about Bryant's death. ... Toronto forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was assisted off the court and did not return after spraining his right ankle with 8:02 remaining in the third quarter. Spurs: White also had 14 points for San Antonio. ... DeRozan was limited to 14 points on 2-for-7 shooting after scoring 20-plus points in 16 of his previous 17 games.","401161328"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young had to compose himself a couple of times when asked about the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna. It wasn't easy for Young, who was mentored by Bryant and had a special relationship with the former NBA star's 13-year-old girl, nicknamed Gigi. ""One of the last conversations we had, he was just telling me how much he's seen my game progress and he's just been happy for me,"" Young said between pauses. ""He said how proud he was of me and how he wants me to continue to be a role model for kids growing up and for Gigi and all the kids looking up to me to inspire these kids and continue to play my heart out."" Young had 45 points and 14 assists in an emotional game for the first-time All-Star, and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Washington Wizards 152-133 on Sunday night. Young looked up toward the rafters several times to honor Bryant, his mentor and favorite NBA player, who died in a helicopter crash earlier in the day. Young wore a No. 8 jersey to salute Bryant during the first few seconds of the game and dressed up his shoes with a heartfelt tribute as well. The Hawks, who have endured a tough season as the worst team in the Eastern Conference, had lost three of four before setting a season scoring high. De'Andre Hunter finished with 25 points, Kevin Huerter had 18 and John Collins 16, but this game belonged to Young, who surpassed 40 points for the eighth time this season, second-most in the NBA. Bradley Beal scored 40 for the Wizards, who dropped to 15-30. Young was sublime in the first half, scoring 21 points, handing out 10 assists and hitting a buzzer-beater from halfcourt. Young has said periodically during his first two NBA seasons that Bryant has helped in his career development and was his favorite player when he was growing up in Oklahoma. Young was proud that Gianna Bryant, who also died in the crash, was one of his biggest fans. She came to two Hawks games this season and met with Young. Their relationship began when Kobe Bryant asked Young who trained him, and hired Alex Bazzell to work with Gigi as well. ""She told me how much she loved watching me play,"" Young said. ""She was a big fan of mine."" Atlanta went on a 22-5 run to begin the third quarter and led 100-77 at the 7:23 mark when Collins dunked on Young's alley-oop pass. The lead swelled to 25 less than a minute later on Young's 3. The Hawks took their first double-digit lead late in the second when Huerter stole an inbounds pass and hit a layup. Atlanta was up 78-72 at halftime. The Wizards pulled within 17 at the end of the third when Troy Brown Jr. banked in a 42-footer at the buzzer. ""Trae, he's a problem,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""He's a handful. He's an All-Star for all the right reasons. He's a hard guy to guard. He was making his shots and getting guys involved."" TIP-INS Wizards: Reserve G Isaac Bonga left late in the second quarter after Young dove for a loose ball and landed on his head, slamming Bonga's jaw against the floor. Bonga was escorted off the court by trainers and held a towel against his bloodied mouth. Washington ruled him out for the second half with a fractured tooth. ... Reserve G Jordan McRae exited late in the third with a leg injury. Hawks: Reserve G DeAndre' Bembry was sidelined for a third straight game and his second in a row with right hand inflammation. KOBE! KOBE! KOBE! Nearly everyone in the arena stood for a moment of silence before the game to honor Bryant, the retired 18-time All-Star and five-time NBA champion. The crowd then joined together for a chant of ""Kobe! Kobe! Kobe!"" with his image displayed on the video board. During the national anthem, Vince Carter, who turned 43 on Sunday and played against Bryant's Lakers and alongside him on national teams throughout a decades-long career, wiped away tears. ""The conversations tended to change and were more friendly, especially in his last year,"" Carter said after the game. ""He was extremely fun, and we were still laughing and joking."" MORE BRYANT Young, who wears No. 11, had on a Hawks No. 8 jersey to honor Bryant at the start of the game, and both teams agreed to give a nod to Bryant at the outset. Young grabbed the opening tip and deliberately turned the ball over after eight seconds. The Wizards followed with a 24-second violation. The crowd cheered both times as the teams acknowledged Bryant's jersey numbers during his career, 8 and 24. After the Hawks called a timeout, Young switched back to his regular jersey. Young hugged his mother before the game and got some advice, to remember what it was like meeting Bryant for the first time as a high school kid at one of his summer camps. ""She just told me to play my heart out,"" Young said. ""He's always going to be watching over me, pulling for me. Just to go out there and play for him, play my heart out and that's what I did tonight.""","401161329"
"NEW YORK --  Every time Kobe Bryant came to Madison Square Garden, it was an event. From the 1998 All-Star Game, his first one, to the night of Feb. 2, 2009, when he broke the arena's scoring record, people just wanted to be in the building. Not Sunday. Kyrie Irving couldn't bring himself to play after his friend's death. The ones who took the floor did so with the knowledge that Bryant would have had one expectation. ""Understand that he'd want you to go out there and play -- hard,"" Knicks veteran Taj Gibson said. Julius Randle, who began his career as Bryant's teammate, had 22 points and 15 rebounds to lead New York to a 110-97 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets were already at the arena when they learned that Bryant and his daughter were among those who had died in a helicopter crash. Irving left after warming up, and at least some people on both sides hoped the game wouldn't be played. ""It was an emotional locker room. It was a quiet locker room. No one spoke for whatever, three hours before we tipped off,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""No one really spoke. Sometimes there are no words and I didn't have any words to console them."" Randle played with the Lakers during Bryant's final two seasons. In his first season with the Knicks, he starred at Madison Square Garden on a night the arena was lit up in the colors of his old team. He left without speaking to reporters. Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie did talk, tearing up while doing so. ""I was born in '93. He was drafted in '96. Grew up in South Central Los Angeles. He was everything to my generation,"" Dinwiddie said. ""There's a whole generation of kids, L.A. kids. That was our childhood."" Madison Square Garden was the site of some of Bryant's biggest highlights and his picture was on the marquis outside. Inside, there was little of the energy that MSG contained whenever Bryant played here, save for a ""Kobe! Kobe!"" chant after a moment of silence before the game. ""Just the air was out of the whole arena,"" Gibson said. Marcus Morris added 21 points to help the Knicks earn a split of the New York season series. He is from the Philadelphia area, same as Bryant. ""Somebody said to me earlier, Superman's not supposed to die,"" Morris said, ""and to us he was Superman."" Dinwiddie, back in the starting lineup with Irving out, scored 23 points for the Nets. Irving was at the arena and warming up before leaving after learning the news about Bryant. The Nets said he was not with the team for personal reasons. ""Obviously, our leader Ky wasn't able to play. Our thoughts go out to him as well as to the families, the Bryant family as well as the other families on the helicopter, parents, the pilots,"" Nets guard Garrett Temple said. ""That was Spencer's idol. When I first heard about it, those was the first two guys on the team I thought about most. Especially with us, we saw him just last month, him and his daughter."" Bryant set the scoring record at the current building with 61 points. Carmelo Anthony later bettered it by a point, but Bryant still shares the opponent record with James Harden. Irving scored 45 points Saturday in Detroit, helping the Nets to an overtime victory that snapped their five-game losing streak. TIP-INS Nets: Irving's absence means he won't play at MSG this season after choosing the Nets over the Knicks in free agency. He was injured during the first meeting at the arena. ... Taurean Prince scored 14 points. Knicks: The Knicks remained without rookie RJ Barrett, who will be out at least another week with a sprained right ankle. ... Mitchell Robinson scored 12 points. REMEMBERING A RECORD Atkinson was in the arena for Bryant's 61-point performance, as a Knicks assistant. ""Incredible performance and iconic, right?"" Atkinson said. SHOOTING STATS The Knicks shot 53.3% and the Nets 42%, a huge improvement over the last meeting in December. The Nets shot 26.9% that night, lowest in the NBA this season, and their eight 2-point field goals were the lowest in an NBA game since the Lakers and Pistons each made four in a Nov. 22, 1950, game that ended 19-18.","401161330"
"Kawhi Leonard fights back tears while talking about his friend Kobe Bryant and how he was able to focus on the court Sunday night. (1:26) ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Los Angeles Clippers won a game nobody wanted to play. The tipoff was less than four hours after the Clippers and Orlando Magic learned of the death of former NBA great Kobe Bryant at the age of 41. ""Sometimes the stage is the best place to get away from reality,"" observed Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""I thought our guys had a two-hour break from an emotional day."" Kawhi Leonard scored 15 of his 31 points in a big third quarter and the Clippers won 112-97 for their sixth victory in seven games. ""It was a tough night for both teams, both coaches. You could just feel the game didn't have a lot of energy in it,"" Rivers said. ""We told our guys, you want to honor (Bryant), go win the game, and they did that. ""We're not prepared for this, none of us were. A lot of relationships Kobe had with guys in our locker room. I was worried. I didn't know if our guys could get through it."" No Clippers were available after the game, but Magic forward Aaron Gordon expressed the players' point of view. ""It was just hard, but at the end of the day we've got to go out there and do our job,"" Gordon said. ""It's what he would have wanted."" Leonard scored seven straight points for the Clippers in the big third quarter to help Los Angeles stretch a four-point lead to 10. Landry Shamel and Montrezl Harrell scored 19 points each for the Clippers and Lou Williams added 15. Leonard also had 14 rebounds, leading Los Angeles to a 53-45 advantage. Michael Carter-Williams came off the bench to lead Orlando with 15 points. Nikola Vucevic added 13 for the Magic, who have lost five of six. They shot 35.4 percent for the game. ""We missed shots and it sapped our energy,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Our lack of shooting really impacted our defensive mentality and we can't play that way."" Orlando led 37-26 after starting the second quarter on a 9-0 spurt. Williams' three free throws started a 21-8 run that pulled the Clippers ahead, and Leonard's scoring burst in the third quarter helped them expand their lead to 19. The Magic didn't get closer than seven again. It was the Clippers' 13th straight win over the Magic. TIP-INS Clippers: Williams (11 points) and Harrell (6) were the only Clippers to score in a first-half stretch of more than 10 minutes. ... F Paul George missed a ninth straight game with a hamstring injury. ... G Patrick Beverley sat out a third straight game with a groin injury. Magic: G D.J. Augustin missed a seventh game with a left knee injury. ... F Maurice Harkless, who started for the Clippers, was in the Magic's starting lineup on Nov. 6, 2013, the last time they beat the Clippers. SUCCESSFUL (?) CHALLENGE Clifford used his coach's challenge with 8:09 left in the third quarter. The challenge was ""successful"" in overturning a foul called on Gordon, but the replay showed a foul on Khem Birch, and Leonard got the two foul shots anyway.","401161331"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The night in Memphis started with a moment of silence for Kobe Bryant. It ended with players from both sides remembering the Los Angeles Lakers great for the good he brought to the game. As for the game itself, Ja Morant scored 14 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter to help the Memphis Grizzlies hold off the Phoenix Suns 114-109 on Sunday night for their second straight victory. Playing hours after news that Bryant was killed in a helicopter accident, the Grizzlies won the opening tip and immediately took a 24-second shot clock violation. When the Suns took possession, they stayed in the backcourt for an 8-second violation -- the 24 and 8 representing Bryant's two numbers during his NBA career. As the Memphis crowd rose in appreciation of Bryant, they began chanting ""Kobe! Kobe!"" ""We were going out and trying to find some energy tonight to go out and compete and get a win,"" Morant said about playing in the somber atmosphere. ""It's a tough night for everybody."" Jaren Jackson Jr. and Dillon Brooks finished with 20 points each for Memphis. Kyle Anderson, who had a season-high 12 rebounds, made a two free throws with 11.3 seconds left. Devin Booker led the Suns with 36 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 27 points, and Deandre Ayton finished with 17 points and 15 rebounds. Phoenix lost for the third time in four games. ""There's no script for a day like today. A lot of guys were playing with a heaviness and to be able to compete on a day like this is difficult,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said, keeping his comments primarily on the loss of Bryant instead of the game. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins called the game ""a gutsy win by our guys,"" but he also kept the bulk of his postgame comments on the loss of Bryant. ""Just the ultimate competitor,"" Jenkins said. ""Everyone is talking about that. I think he touches so many people with that drive, whether you were with him as a teammate, on staff, or you competed against him night in and night out. He set a tone."" Memphis built the lead to double digits, reaching 14 with just under five minutes- to play in the third quarter. The Suns put on a burst at the close of the period, pulling to 79-78 with a 17-4 run as the Grizzlies struggled to hold on to the ball, committing nine turnovers in the quarter. But Morant took over the fourth. In the final 4:06, with the Suns continuing to threaten the Memphis lead, Morant scored eight of 10 Memphis points and the only one where he didn't, he assisted on an alley-oop to Brandon Clarke. The Suns trailed by a single point on several occasions down the stretch and tied the game twice but could never overtake the Grizzlies, Memphis scoring the games final four points at the free throw line. ""This is a bad day, obviously, but we just got to continue to move forward,"" Oubre said.

FINAL WORD ""It's hard. They are thinking about something that's way more important than a basketball game. You are sitting there trying to coach and sometimes you ask yourself, `what are you doing?' Before the game, I just repeatedly told them how much I loved them and had them tell that to each other, their family, whoever it is."" -- Williams about his players dealing with the news of Bryant's death only hours before the game.","401161332"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Zion Williamson had 21 points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Boston Celtics 123-108 on Sunday for their first victory since the rookie star joined the lineup. Jrue Holiday had 25 points, JJ Redick scored 17 and Brandon Ingram added 16 for New Orleans, which snapped a two-game slide. Williamson played his most minutes yet in his third game back from arthroscopic knee surgery performed the day before the regular season opened. He had played the first five or so minutes of each quarter in his first two games, but the Pelicans made an adjustment to his fourth-quarter usage to allow the NBA's top overall draft choice out of Duke to be on the court for the final minutes Sunday. It paid off. Williamson scored eight points in the final three minutes -- highlighted by a dunk on a baseline cut as he was fouled -- and the Pelicans pulled away. Kemba Walker scored 35 points, Gordon Hayward 23 and Jaylen Brown 20 for the Celtics, who fell behind for good in the first quarter and trailed by as many as 23 in the third quarter. Boston hit just 16 of its first 43 shot -- including 3-of-17 shooting from 3-point range -- during the first half. New Orleans took advantage, opening a 62-42 lead by halftime. Seven Pelicans players combined for 10 3-pointers in the opening half, with Ingram, Holiday and Lonzo Ball each hitting two. Williamson scored nine points while playing 12:26 through the first two quarters. His early highlights included an alley-oop layup on a long lob from Ball as Williamson raced down the lane in transition. He would have scored more if he hadn't missed four of his first five free throws. New Orleans led by 23 early in the third quarter and was still up by 18 when Williamson soared to the rim over Boston's Vincent Poirier to slam back Redick's missed 3. Soon after, Walker hit a 3 and added free throws during a 7-0 mini-run that pulled Boston to 87-79. In the fourth quarter, Josh Hart and Redick missed consecutive breakaway layups and then Marcus Smart scored inside while being fouled by Williamson to cut it to 97-91. But Redick followed with a 3 and Williamson scored on a drive from the top of the key to make it 102-91 with 8:20 to go. Boston struggled to stay within 10 after that.

"Carmelo Anthony reflects on his relationship with Kobe Bryant and how it was deeper than basketball. (1:45) PORTLAND, Ore. --  On a night when he set another franchise mark, Damian Lillard's thoughts weren't on his game. They were on Kobe Bryant. Lillard had 50 points and 13 assists, becoming the first Portland player with 40-plus points in three straight games, and the Trail Blazers beat the Indiana Pacers 139-129 on a Sunday marked by grief over the death of the NBA great. I think it was the right decision for us to go out there and compete today in his honor. I think that's what he would have wanted,"" Lillard said. ""Obviously, throughout the game you think about it. The timeouts, and just random dead moments of the game, he's on your mind, because it's just such an unfortunately sad situation. It was a tough game to play as far as your energy and where your heart is, to say the least. The Trail Blazers honored Bryant with 24 seconds of silence before the game, and the team took a 24-second shot-clock violation at the start before the Pacers took an eight-second timeline penalty, recognizing Bryant's jersey numbers. Several fans at the Moda Center wore Lakers jerseys, saluting a player who spent his entire career with rival Los Angeles. CJ McCollum returned after a three-game absence because of an ankle injury and added 28 points for the Blazers (20-27). Hassan Whiteside had 21 points and 14 rebounds. Domantas Sabonis, whose father Arvydas played for the Blazers, had 27 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds for the Pacers in his second career triple-double. His first came last Sunday at Denver. ""Weve been having a lot of injuries all year so I just wanted to come out, be aggressive and help the team any way I can,"" Sabonis said. Indiana (30-17) hasn't won in Portland since the 2007-08 season, a streak of 11 games. But there was a pall over the game because of the helicopter crash earlier Sunday that killed Bryant, one of his daughters, and seven others in Southern California. Both coaches spoke about Bryant before the game. Anytime you played against him, you knew you were going to get his best effort. Thats just the way he played the game,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Pacers coach Nate McMillan was an assistant for U.S. national teams that featured Bryant in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. A former coach of the Trail Blazers, McMillan recalled how Bryant once scored 65 points against Portland. Hes a guy that, as he was growing up, I think there was that commercial, `I want to be like Mike. He wanted to be like Mike. And now he has young kids saying, `I want to be like Kobe,'"" McMillan said. ""I had the opportunity 2008, 2012, to see those great guys, Kobe, Wade and LeBron, work. And he really set the example in 2008 for how he prepared, and how the world respected him -- the attention he got in Beijing. It was unreal to see how those fans there treated him and respected him."" NBA veteran Carmelo Anthony, who finished with 14 points for the Blazers, choked up while talking about Bryant after the game. They were teammates on the Olympic team and had spoken just a few days ago. Our friendship, our relationship, was deeper than basketball,"" Anthony said. ""It was family. It was friendship. Basketball was the last piece of connective tissue between us two. The Pacers were without starter Malcolm Brogdon, who missed his second straight game in concussion protocol after taking an elbow against Phoenix on Wednesday. Indiana center Myles Turner also sat out because of illness. Lillard hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to end the first quarter and give the Blazers a 36-27 lead. Whiteside's alley-oop dunk from Lillard put the Blazers up 57-49 late in the half, and Portland had a 66-56 lead at the break. Whiteside had another dunk off a pass from Anthony and added a free throw to put the Blazers up 93-76. Portland led by as many as 21 but Indiana closed to 103-96 at the end of the third quarter. TIP-INS Pacers: Completed a 3-2 trip. ""We came in trying to go 4-1 on this road trip. I thought we fought and we gave it our all.

"DETROIT --  Before his team took the court, Cavaliers star Kevin Love spent some of his day looking back at Kobe Bryant's life and career. ""I watched his short film, I watched all of his highlights, I watched his interviews,"" Love said. ""I have videos on my phone, from the Olympics, from All-Star Games, where they're intimate and behind-the-scenes type of stuff."" Love was an Olympic teammate of Bryant's and played college basketball in Los Angeles at UCLA, so it felt fitting when he made six 3-pointers in the first half Monday night during Cleveland's 115-100 win over the Detroit Pistons. The Cavaliers snapped a seven-game losing streak. It was the first game for either team since Bryant's death Sunday in a helicopter crash. The teams honored Bryant's two uniform numbers when Cleveland committed a 24-second shot clock violation after the opening tip, and the Pistons gave the ball back with an 8-second violation in the backcourt. Fans observed 24 seconds of silence in Bryant's honor before the game. Cleveland scored 24 points in the first quarter, and Love finished with just over 24 minutes played. Larry Nance Jr. -- a teammate of Bryant's with the Lakers -- scored 10 points for Cleveland in just under 24 minutes. ""Sometimes, it just happens that way,"" Love said. ""Feels like sometimes it should, if you just go out there and do right by the game of basketball, like Kobe would have wanted."" It was the third meeting this month between the Pistons and Cavaliers. They split a home-and-home series Jan. 7 and 9 in a pair of tightly contested games. This one wasn't nearly as close. Cleveland led 53-45 at halftime. Love scored all 20 of his points in the first half and did not even need to attempt a shot in the final 24 minutes. It was 89-72 after three quarters. Cleveland had not won by double digits since a 108-87 victory at New York on Nov. 10. ""We talk about, you know, Kobe this, Kobe that,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""Believe me, rest his soul, he would be embarrassed how we, our non-compete level."" Collin Sexton had 23 points for the Cavaliers and Tristan Thompson added 17 points and 11 rebounds.

Adebayo finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He's a candidate to be a reserve selection for the All-Star Game; coaches pick those teams, and their ballots are due at the NBA office on Tuesday for an announcement on Thursday. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra doesn't lobby colleagues to sway their vote. ""Maybe that's wrong,"" Spoelstra said. ""I don't feel comfortable doing that. ... Your play should speak louder than anything else and I feel at the core of my heart that Bam's play has made him an All-Star and our winning should also be proof of that."" Jimmy Butler scored 19 points, Goran Dragic had 14 and Tyler Herro scored 13 for Miami. The Heat improved to 13-0 at home against Eastern Conference teams. Nikola Vucevic had 13 points and 12 rebounds for Orlando. Aaron Gordon scored 12 points, Markelle Fultz had 12 and Terrence Ross had 11 for Orlando. ""Our starters got badly outplayed to start the game and got crushed to start the third quarter,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""To me that was the biggest factor."" Bryant, his daughter Gianna and the other seven victims of the helicopter crash in Southern California were remembered, as has been the case in every game since the news broke on Sunday. The Heat played a video tribute pregame, putting 24.8 seconds -- part of a series of nods to Bryant's jersey numbers with the Los Angeles Lakers -- on the scoreboard. The Heat took a 24-second violation to start the game, the Magic then took an 8-second violation. Several players had messages to remember Bryant and his daughter scrawled on their sneakers. And at halftime, the Oscar-winning animated version of Bryant's poem ""Dear Basketball"" was shown on the arena screens. ""I don't know if there's enough you can do,"" Spoelstra said. The Heat went on a 19-2 run over a six-minute stretch of the third quarter, taking a game that it led by six at the half and seven when that spurt began and turning things into a 76-52 cushion. Orlando was 1 for 8 from the field with a pair of turnovers during that stretch. Orlando played its league high-tying 15th game of January, its third game in four nights and sixth in a span of nine days. And now the Magic get a very unusual break after such a hectic stretch, with four full days off before playing host to Miami on Saturday. ""We see them on Saturday,"" Gordon said. ""We have to figure this out or the same thing will happen."" TIP-INS Magic: Orlando's four-game losing streak ties a season-worst, last done in early November. The Magic haven't lost five in a row since March 2018. ... It was Vucevic's 23rd start against Miami, the fourth-most by anyone in Magic history. Heat: Adebayo played in his 132nd consecutive game, tying Grant Long for the fifth-longest streak in Heat history. He's two away from matching Isaac Austin's fourth-longest Heat streak. ... Kendrick Nunn (sore Achilles tendon) remained out for a second straight game. TIME CHANGE With the Lakers-Clippers game in Los Angeles being postponed Tuesday, the NBA moved the start of Tuesday's Boston at Miami game back 30 minutes to 8 p.m. to accommodate a national television audience.","401161336"
"Zach LaVine describes the impact Kobe Bryant had on him and his generation, and what it meant to play for him tonight. (1:48) CHICAGO --  Zach LaVine felt he was one shot away. Once they started going in, he took over. LaVine scored 14 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, including two clutch foul shots with 2.1 seconds left, and the Chicago Bulls beat the San Antonio Spurs 110-109 on Monday night. The 24-year-old LaVine, making a bid for his first All-Star appearance, extended his streak of games with at least 20 points to 15, matching his career best. He went 4 for 8 from the field in the fourth after missing 11 of his first 14 shots. ""Just had to settle in,"" he said. ""I'm always confident. My teammates kept telling me, `You're going to help us win this game.' All I needed to see was one go in, and I think that's how you turn a bad game into a good one."" LaVine won an entertaining duel with DeMar DeRozan after Chicago trailed by 10 heading into the final period. DeRozan tied it at 108 on a tough fadeaway jumper with 8.6 seconds left, but LaVine responded with two free throws after he was fouled by Jakob Poetl on a drive to the basket. San Antonio had one last chance, and DeRozan was fouled by Kris Dunn on a long jumper with 0.2 seconds to go. DeRozan made the first free throw, missed the second and grabbed the rebound, but was unable to get a shot off before time expired. ""I shot it long, it came off and I just tried to get it back up there and give it a chance to go in,"" DeRozan said. Chicago placed seven players in double figures in its third win in four games. Denzel Valentine scored 16 points, and Thaddeus Young and Tomas Satoransky each added 13. DeRozan had 36 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio. Patty Mills made six 3-pointers and finished with 25 points. ""They competed harder for most of the 48 minutes,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I thought we competed for a half, maybe more than that. But not very consistent."" The Spurs played without forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who was sidelined by a sprained right thumb. The 34-year-old Aldridge stayed in San Antonio after he had 10 points and 10 rebounds during Sunday's 110-106 loss to Toronto. Poetl, who replaced Aldridge in the starting lineup, finished with 16 points and 13 rebounds. But he missed three big foul shots in the fourth after he was intentionally fouled by Chicago. He was 2 for 8 on free throws for the game. Bulls coach Jim Boylen said he decided to send Poetl to the line to take the ball out of DeRozan's hands. ""Those are the decisions you make in game,"" he said. ""My assistants were on it and sometimes it works out for you."" IN MEMORIAM The Bulls paid tribute to Kobe Bryant with a pregame video and 24 seconds of silence. Fans also used chalk to write messages remembering Bryant on the pavement outside the United Center. The former Los Angeles Lakers star was killed Sunday in a helicopter crash in Southern California. After Chicago won the opening tip, it took an 8-second backcourt violation. San Antonio then took a 24-second shot clock violation. Bryant wore Nos. 8 and 24 during his NBA career. ""There will never be another Kobe Bryant,"" said LaVine, who wears No. 8 and idolized Bryant growing up. ""There's only one person like that ever. He touched so many lives in the way he affected basketball, and beyond that as well."" TIP-INS Spurs: Led by Mills, San Antonio went 10 for 25 from 3-point range. ... C Trey Lyles had 10 points and eight rebounds. Bulls: F Otto Porter Jr. (broken left foot) completed a routine of skipping and walking at the morning shootaround. But Boylen said Porter isn't running just yet. ""He looked upbeat, like he's chomping at it a little bit, which I think is good,"" Boylen said. Porter hasn't played since Nov. 6. ... F Lauri Markkanen missed his third consecutive game because of a right hip injury. He is expected to remain sidelined through the All-Star break. ""Lauri says he feels good, kind of waiting that thing out,"" Boylen said.","401161337"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  On a night full of tributes to Kobe Bryant, Buddy Hield's stole the show. Channeling the memories of his childhood hero, Hield poured in a career-high 42 points to rally the Sacramento Kings from a 27-point deficit to a 133-129 overtime victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night. ""That's the reason I wanted to play in the NBA because of Kobe,"" Hield said. ""I feel that he was with me. He never gives up. That's always his mentality. Never give up. No matter what the stakes was, he was always pushing, always pressing. He's making sure guys feel him. That's what I did tonight."" De'Aaron Fox scored 22 for the Kings, putting back the rebound of his intentionally missed free throw as part of a 33-11 run over the final 5:42 of regulation. Sacramento trailed by 17 with 2:49 left. According to ESPN Stats and Info, entering Monday, NBA teams were 0-8,378 since 1996-97 when trailing by 17 or more in the final 3 minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. ""No matter what, we should be able to play with a 15-point lead with a couple minutes left,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""They made shots. We didn't execute our defensive game plan. We didn't get rebounds when we needed to. We didn't make the needed plays."" Sacramento ended a five-game road trip with its second consecutive victory. Fox scored 17 points in the second half and overtime. Nemanja Bjelica finished with 20 points. ""We've been on the road for 10 days, and it's been an emotional last couple days,"" said Kings coach Luke Walton, a teammate of Bryant's for nine seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers. ""We'll take it. What I love about this group is what they've shown all year, which is they don't ever stop fighting."" Andrew Wiggins had 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Timberwolves, who lost their 10th consecutive game. With the Kings down three with 4.7 seconds left in regulation, Fox made his first free throw. He intentionally fired the second off the front of the rim, grabbed his own rebound and laid it in to tie the game with 3.6 seconds left. That was after Hield shot the Kings back into the game. Hield grew up in the Bahamas idolizing Bryant, who died Sunday in a helicopter crash. He wears No. 24 in Bryant's honor. After Monday's game, he fondly recalled his first meeting with Bryant while playing in the Elite Eight with Oklahoma. Monday he scored 18 points in the final 4:36 of regulation. His 42 points came on 24 shots. He was 9 for 14 from 3-point range. Hield is the third player ever to score 40 or more points and make nine or more 3-pointers off the bench. He joins J.R. Smith and Rodrigue Beaubois. ""I can't wait until I have a son and tell my son about this game,"" Hield said. ""Tell my son about Kobe Bryant. I want to show him his highlights, but I'm going to show him that this was the guy that inspired me. This was the guy who inspired the world."" The Timberwolves built their lead thanks to a franchise-record 23 3-pointers. Wiggins was 7 for 11 beyond the arc. Robert Covington had 24 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 23 for Minnesota. It was the first time three Timberwolves have scored 20 or more points in a game since Dec. 13. The final result was not the tribute to Bryant that Minnesota had in mind. ""I mean the loss of Kobe is something that we all think of,"" Timberwolves guard Shabazz Napier said. ""But the competitor he is, he would be upset with us, truly upset with us, and I think once you step on them lines all you're thinking about is playing the game at the highest level. Today we did a dishonest to him, to the Minnesota Timberwolves organization, to the fans."" TIP-INS Kings: Forward Marvin Bagley III missed his third consecutive game with left foot soreness. ... Forward Richaun Holmes was out for the seventh straight game with right shoulder soreness. ... The Kings snapped a three-game losing streak against the Timberwolves. Timberwolves: Guard Allen Crabbe did not play after suffering a left knee subluxation Saturday against Oklahoma City. ... Forward Jake Layman missed his 33rd consecutive game with a left toe sprain. Minnesota's eight first-quarter 3-pointers tied a franchise record for 3s in a quarter. Minnesota hit 10 of its first 15 3-point attempts and shot 14 for 23 from 3 in the first half. That set a franchise record for 3s in a half. HONORING KOBE The Timberwolves honored Bryant prior to tipoff with words from Towns, a video tribute and a moment of silence. Towns wore No. 24 and Covington wore No. 8 while being introduced as part of the starting lineup to honor Bryant. They donned their regular Nos. 32 and 33 before the opening tip. To open the game, Minnesota took an 8-second backcourt violation and Sacramento took a 24-second shot-clock violation on the ensuing possession. While taking the 8-second violation, Wiggins placed the ball on the free throw line where Bryant scored to pass Michael Jordan for third place on the career scoring list on Dec. 14, 2014, at Target Center.","401161338"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Kobe Bryant's death fully registered with Luka Doncic in the midst of a game. Doncic had 29 points and 11 rebounds, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 107-97 Monday a night after Bryant, one of the NBA's all-time greats, was involved in a fatal helicopter crash. Doncic had been thinking about it all -- the All-Star had messages remembering those involved in the accident on his shoes. Still, a wave of emotion hit suddenly and unexpectedly. ""I broke down after the first quarter,"" he said. ""That was when it really hit me. It was really hard to explain."" When the game started following a moment of silence, the Mavericks took an 8-second violation in honor of the number Bryant wore to start his NBA career. The Thunder then took a 24-second shot clock violation in honor of the number Bryant wore later. After the two violations, the scoreboard clock read 11:24, and the 24-second clock below it had been reset to show 24 seconds. The crowd chanted ""Kobe! Kobe!"" as the clock counted down. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle tried his best to get his players to focus on playing basketball. ""This was a tough, emotional game,"" he said. ""It was like that for both teams, but I'm proud of our guys for keeping it together and getting through it."" Dallas controlled most of the game. The Mavericks led 59-47 at halftime and pushed the lead to 70-54 before the Thunder went on an 11-0 run. Dallas regained control and led 88-77 at the end of the third quarter. The Mavericks led by at least 10 points the entire fourth quarter. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 15 points and Kristaps Porzingis added 14 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas. Dennis Schroder scored 21 points for the Thunder. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 16 points but missed 15 of his 20 shots. After the game, Bryant's death brought a heavy dose of perspective to the locker rooms. ""For it to happen to someone like him -- a role model, a father, a husband and a living legend -- it is heartbreaking and heartwrenching,"" Hardaway said. Schroder, who played for the Atlanta Hawks before he joined the Thunder, remembered a game against the Lakers in Atlanta. ""Felt like a home game for them (the Lakers),"" Schroder said. ""There were so many Laker fans, all purple and yellow, everybody chanting for Kobe."" Gilgeous-Alexander wore a gold No. 8 Bryant jersey to his interview session. ""I just wanted to pay homage to a guy I looked up to growing up,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""There's a lot of guys also in the league that look up to him. He's done wonderful things for this game."" TIP-INS Mavericks: C Willie Cauley-Stein, acquired in a trade with Golden State, did not play. Mavericks coach Rich Carlisle said before the game that Cauley-Stein had been with the team for less than 24 hours. ... Outrebounded the Thunder 56-48. ... Attempted 51 3-pointers and made 19. ... The Thunder scored zero points off the Mavericks' nine turnovers. Thunder: Paul had joined Gilgeous-Alexander as the only Thunder players to start every game this season. In 47 games, he averages 17.2 points, 6.4 assists and 5.0 rebounds. ... Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson also sat out for personal reasons. ... C Nerlens Noel played with a mask after having surgery for a fractured cheek. HE SAID IT Hardaway, whose father played against Michael Jordan: ""I didn't grow up watching Michael Jordan like that. My dad played against him, so when I was older and able to pick up the game of basketball in the 2000s, Kobe was like our Michael Jordan for my type of generation and younger. So it was with a lot of heavy hearts and we made sure that we came out and competed for him, because I know that is what he would want everyone to do for him.""","401161339"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Eric Gordon is feeling like himself again on offense. That's bad news for Houston opponents. Gordon scored a career-high 50 points to lead the short-handed Rockets to a 126-117 victory over the Utah Jazz on Monday night without James Harden and Russell Westbrook. In a stat line that resembled one Harden might put up, Gordon shot 14 of 22 from the field -- including 6 for 11 on 3-pointers -- and 16 of 20 at the free throw line. He became the first Rockets player besides Harden to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon had 51 in January 1996, according to STATS. Harden has done it 23 times since. ""I feel like I'm getting back to being myself,"" said Gordon, who had knee surgery in November. ""I told everybody when you have surgery during the season, it's always going to be a process."" Houston needed his outburst with Harden, Westbrook and Clint Capela sitting out. The veteran guard had his first game with more than 30 points this season. His previous career best of 41 came against Oklahoma City on Jan. 23, 2009. ""You just marvel in it,"" teammate Austin Rivers said. ""He's like a bowling ball when he drives to the basket. Dudes just bounce off of him. He's so low to the ground and he's so strong."" Gordon missed 22 games after having surgery on his right knee Nov. 13. Since his return, he's averaging 20 points in 13 games. ""He's pain-free for the first time in a year and a half,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""There will be ups and downs like all the others, but Eric is going to be good. As long as he's not hurting, he's going to be good."" Harden missed his second straight game with a bruised left thigh. Capela (bruised right heel) and Westbrook (rest) sat out after playing Sunday against Denver. Danuel House Jr. added 21 points and a career-high 11 rebounds, and Rivers also had a season-best 21 points as Houston handed the Jazz their first home loss since Dec. 9. Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 30, but Utah lost for just the third time in 22 games despite shooting 51% from the field. ""We weren't expecting to play perfect the rest of the year and we're going to have games like this,"" Mitchell said. ""The biggest thing is how we respond."" Gordon scored 15 points in the second quarter and helped the Rockets close the first half on a 17-6 run to take a 59-46 lead into the break. Thabo Sefolosha started and finished the run by driving for layups. ""We weren't as focused and dialed in on all the details in the game,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Eric Gordon is one of the best scorers in the league. We have a game tonight where he knows they need his points and he's even more aggressive."" Utah trimmed the deficit to 72-66 midway through the third on consecutive 3s from Bogdanovic, but got no closer. Rivers and House answered with back-to-back baskets to stop the rally. That sparked a 15-6 spurt that gave Houston an 87-72 lead near the end of the quarter. REMEMBERING KOBE There was a moment of silence for Kobe Bryant before tipoff. Bryant died Sunday at age 41 in a helicopter crash in California along with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others. The Jazz committed a 24-second shot clock violation on their first possession. The Rockets followed by committing an 8-second backcourt violation. Both gestures were done in remembrance of Bryant, who wore jersey numbers 24 and 8 during his 20-year NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers. ""He's a legend and we're going to miss him,"" Mitchell said. ""I think we can all do our part because he was a legend, not just on the court, but as a human being."" Jazz fans put together a shrine for Bryant on the J Note statue outside the arena. The shrine included Bryant jerseys, basketballs, flowers, teddy bears, balloons and candles. It also featured a handwritten sign that said, ""Thank you Kobe!"" GOING SMALL Houston played small ball against Utah with great success. The tallest starter for the Rockets was the 6-foot-6 House. D'Antoni put 6-foot-5 P.J. Tucker at center with Capela out. The strategy bothered the Jazz for long stretches. Houston attacked the rim often and ended up attempting an NBA season-high 49 free throws. The Rockets scored 35 points from the line to go along with 40 points in the paint. ""This is something we've been looking at -- going small. That really messed with them,"" Rivers said. ""We played at a speed that was uncomfortable for them."" TIP-INS Rockets: Sefolosha made a season-high four field goals. . D'Antoni challenged a foul called on Michael Frazier with 4:19 left in the first quarter. It was overturned and changed to an offensive foul on Bogdanovic. . Houston scored 26 points off 18 Jazz turnovers and had a 20-9 edge in second-chance points. Jazz: Rudy Gobert grabbed a game-high 14 rebounds. . Utah shot 3 of 22 from 3-point range in the first half. . The Jazz outscored Houston 56-40 in the paint.","401161340"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  The Charlotte Hornets are back home and back in the win column. Terry Rozier scored 30 points and the Hornets rallied from a 13-point deficit to beat the New York Knicks 97-92 on Tuesday night and snap a season-high, eight-game losing streak. Charlotte (16-31) trailed by 13 points three times in the second quarter before closing within 50-47 at halftime and taking the lead for good late in the third quarter. The Hornets hadn't won since Jan. 4 and their losing streak was the longest for the franchise since the 2014-15 season. ""Its been a rough couple weeks for many reasons but give our guys credit,"" said Charlotte coach James Borrego, whose team's last game was Friday against the Milwaukee Bucks in Paris. ""They hung with it. This was not an easy game to come to, to come back from Paris, this is a difficult game. Obviously with Kobe's death and the number of things that have happened over the last week, I'm proud of our guys. They hung in there. We did not get off to a great start but we hung in there and showed some resiliency and togetherness and competed. We fought tonight and got a good win for us."" The game started like many others around the NBA since Bryant's death in a helicopter crash on Sunday. The Hornets won the opening tap and dribbled out a 24-second shot clock violation and the Knicks responded by dribbling out an 8-second backcourt violation. Bryant wore the Nos. 24 and 8 for the Los Angeles Lakers during his career. Additionally, all Hornets players wore Jumpman Jordan Brand white sleeves with the numbers 8 and 24 on them. ""Actually it was our equipment guy, (Jason Rivera), who thought of it,"" Rozier said. ""Obviously you've seen a lot of people doing things around the league. Detroit did the jerseys so we wanted to do something unique and different. He thought of the sleeves and it was perfect."" Miles Bridges added 15 points, Malik Monk 13 and Cody Zeller 10 for Charlotte on a night in which reserve Willy Hernangomez had his first double-double (12 points and 10 rebounds) of the season. Hernangomez hasn't played in 29 of the Hornets' first 47 games but has now played in six of the last seven, scoring in double figures in three of them. New York built its 13-points leads as Julius Randle scored 12 in the first quarter and 18 in the first half. But Rozier scored nine points in the second quarter to spark a 26-16 over the final eight minutes of the half as Charlotte pulled within three. In the second half, Charlotte used balanced scoring to take charge at 84-74 with 3:15 to play. The Hornets still had to survive a late Knicks surge that closed the margin to four points three times in the final 1:10 and eventually got as close as 95-92 with 10.6 seconds left. Rozier hit eight free throws in the final 40 seconds to keep Charlotte comfortably ahead. Randle had 24 points and Marcus Morris scored 23 for New York. TIP-INS Knicks: Interim coach Mike Miller had no further updates on injured rookie R.J. Barrett, who missed his sixth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ""Three days ago he was evaluated and we said it was going to be a little bit longer,"" Miller said. ""We want to make sure he's progressing well."" Barrett, the third overall pick in the 2019 draft out of Duke, is averaging 14.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 41 games (all starts) this season. The Canadian told reporters before the game that he wanted to retire his nickname of ""Maple Mamba"" out of respect for Bryant. Hornets: The Hornets have nine losing streaks in their history of 10 or more games. Charlotte's longest losing streak is 23 games at the end of the 2011-12 season. The last 10-game losing streak came from Nov. 15 to Dec. 3, 2014. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE An overturned foul call cost the Knicks a potential four-point play with 1:56 to play and left the Knicks puzzled and Borrego happy he had saved his challenge until the end. Morris had hit a 3-pointer that would've pulled the Knicks within 88-82 with a free throw pending. Instead, Borrego challenged the foul call, the play was reviewed and Morris was called for a foul for trying to draw a foul on his 3-point shot. ""I think we're all learning as coaches in this league how to use it or when to use it,"" Borrego said. ""I don't think it's a perfect science right now. I've held on to my challenges until late in the game and tonight it obviously helped us."" Knicks interim coach Mike Miller wasn't sure about the call after the game. When asked if he got an explanation on the decision to overturn the call, Miller said: ""Not one that I completely understood, so if I said it I may not say it right. So, I'm not sure."" REMEMBERING KOBE Borrego called Bryant's death on Sunday ""probably one of the saddest days in NBA history if not the saddest."" But Borrego says he still has a cherished memory of Bryant from the 2016 NBA All-Star Game in Toronto when he was a West assistant coach on San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich's staff. ""I was eavesdropping on a conversation between he and another great player who is still playing in the league -- I won't say his name -- and the whole conversation was built around work. He (Bryant) said, 'Look, you have the opportunity to be one of the greatest of all time if you'll continue to work the way you have.' Bryant started and scored 10 points in that game that was won 196-173 by the West over the East.","401161341"
"Zion Williamson reacts to the large amount of attention he's been receiving in the NBA. (0:59) CLEVELAND --  Zion Williamson's NBA road debut didn't have much flash or any fireworks. It wasn't a show, and that was just fine with the hyped rookie. Check off another box. Williamson scored 14 points -- all inside -- in his first pro game outside New Orleans and Jrue Holiday had 26, leading the Pelicans to a 125-111 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night. Playing in just his fourth game, Williamson added nine rebounds in 30 minutes, his most as a pro. He didn't do anything spectacular or particularly crowd pleasing, but that hardly mattered to him or the Pelicans, who are just happy to have the big man on the floor. ""It was great,"" Williamson said. ""We got the win. The crowd's energy was great."" Brandon Ingram scored 24 and Nicolo Melli made two big 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to slow Cleveland's comeback. Collin Sexton scored 24, rookie Kevin Porter Jr. 21 and Larry Nance Jr. had 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who have lost eight of nine. It was Cleveland's first game at home since Kobe Bryant's death, and Nance honored his former Lakers teammate by wearing No. 24 in the first half instead of his usual No. 22. Williamson returned last week after missing the Pelicans' first 43 games following right knee surgery, and the team's medical staff is closely monitoring his playing time as he gets back into game shape. Coach Alvin Gentry has grown tired of the talk about Williamson's minutes, and they should no longer be a topic of conversation. ""He played 30 minutes,"" Gentry said, ""and most guys aren't going to play more than 30 minutes anyway."" The former Duke star didn't score in the first quarter before he dropped consecutive layups in the second. Later, Williamson caught a pass on the block and was set to deliver a two-handed dunk, but Sexton blocked it from behind and then shot a glance at the heralded 19-year-old. ""He's a good player, but he didn't really beat us,"" Sexton said. ""It was Holiday and Brandon."" Williamson smiled when Sexton's block was mentioned. ""He got me that time."" Williamson said with a chuckle. ""He got the best of me on that one. Hopefully, next time I get a different result."" When the Cavs were cutting into the Pelicans' double-digit lead in the fourth, Williamson grabbed offensive rebounds and made putbacks on consecutive possessions. ""Those were big baskets,"" Gentry said. ""He's got great hands and if he gets a hold of the ball it's his."" Williamson's first road game brought out Cleveland fans, who a year ago were hoping and praying to the basketball gods for the NBA draft lottery to go their way so they could get him. There was a buzz inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse during early warmups as Williamson worked on post-up moves and drives. When he came off the floor, fans pushed forward to take his photo or beg for an autograph. Williamson signed a few jerseys before heading to the locker room escorted by security personnel. Williamson is in high demand, and Gentry said that's something he needs to monitor. ""One of the things he's going to have to learn to do is to say no,"" Gentry said. ""I think that's hard for him. There's always a line of people outside every hotel, every restaurant he's in. He's going to have to be a little protective of his own private space sometime."" Williamson said once the game starts, he's able to ignore outside noise. ""During warmups, I hear it all because it's funny,"" he said. ""During the game, its just natural that it gets blocked out. When I'm warming up, people say, `Zion, come over here. I can't right now."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Former Cavs general manager David Griffin visited with Cleveland players, friends and arena employees before the game. Griffin spent seven seasons with the Cavs and was their GM when they won the NBA title in 2016. ... Gentry said Williamson's intangibles extend beyond the floor. ""He has the 'X' factor,"" Gentry said. ""He's all about the team. He's going to play hard. He's going to do things that help other guys become better."" Cavaliers: Rested rookie G Darius Garland. Coach John Beilein said the decision to sit Garland was due to ""fatigue"" and because the first-round pick is ""getting worn down."" ... Cleveland will plays its next three at home. ... Beilein is amazed by Williamson's mobility for a 285-pounder. ""We were just talking about how crazy athletic a man can be at that size, with that body type,"" he said.

"MIAMI --  The Eastern Conference standings are not difficult to decipher. Theres Milwaukee on top, and then a five-team race for second place. And the Boston Celtics made the mess even messier. Gordon Hayward scored 29 points and grabbed nine rebounds, Jaylen Brown added 25 points and the Celtics led most of the game on the way to beating the Miami Heat 109-101 on Tuesday night. ""Every game is important, Hayward said. Every single one we play is important in the playoff race. We're all so close together so ... each one we have to treat it like a playoff game. That's just how tight it is. Boston became the first East team to come into Miami and win this season; the rest of the conference had been 0-13 on the Heat floor. The Celtics held Miami to 37% shooting, a season-worst at home and the third-worst effort in 47 Heat games this season. Their defense really jammed us up, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said after his team fell to 0-2 against Boston this season. Thats two games that theyve done it to us. Were better than this ... and the little things matter against a good defensive team like this. Kemba Walker added 16 points and eight assists for Boston, which got 11 points from Marcus Smart and a 10-point, 11-rebound effort from Daniel Theis. Toronto moved into second in the East, a game up on Miami. The Celtics are a half-game back of the Heat, No. 5 Philadelphia is a game behind Boston and No. 6 Indiana is only a half-game back of the 76ers. Goran Dragic led Miami with 23 points and Jimmy Butler scored 20. Bam Adebayo had 16 points and 10 rebounds and Duncan Robinson scored 12 points for the Heat. Boston outscored Miami 15-0 from 3-point range in the games first nine minutes, a big reason why the Celtics took control from the outset and built as much as a 13-point lead in the opening quarter. Miami went to zone and slowed the Celtics down, but it wasn't enough. Guys did a really good job of attacking it,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Once we got a comfortable rhythm against it we were a little bit better. It's hard to score on those guys."" Miami took the lead on a pair of occasions in the second, only for a span of a couple minutes. The Celtics took a 53-48 lead into the half and watched Miami score to make it a one- or two-possession game time and time again down the stretch. But the Heat never held the lead in the second half. Every time they got close, Boston had the answer and Smarts 3-pointer with 1:50 left put Boston up by eight to all but seal matters. The tributes to the life of Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash Sunday along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, continued. Spoelstra, Stevens and their staffs wore Bryants signature sneakers -- a gesture that other NBA coaches made Tuesday as well. It's about more than the player,"" Adebayo said. It's about a lot more when you're honoring Kobe."" The Heat also displayed the numbers 8 and 24, Bryants two jersey numbers in the distinctive Los Angeles Lakers purple and gold, on an electronic sign attached to the basket stanchions. TIP-INS Celtics: Jayson Tatum (right groin strain) missed his third consecutive game. Tatum said he feels like hes closing in on a return. Obviously, with that type of an injury, we have to be very careful, Stevens said. ... Enes Kanter (bruised right hip) also remained sidelined. ... The Celtics play four of their next five games against teams below the .500 mark. Heat: Adebayos games-played streak reached 133, one away from Isaac Austin for the fourth-longest run in Heat history. If he plays in every game this season, hell reach No. 2 on the list and be six shy of matching Glen Rices team record of 174. ... Mike Matheson and Aaron Ekblad of the Florida Panthers were among those in attendance. WALKER OLYMPICS? Walker was part of USA Basketball this past summer for the World Cup in China, saying afterward that he wanted to be back with the team this summer for the Tokyo Olympics. He hasnt wavered. If they want me, Im there, Walker said Tuesday. USA Basketball is expected to announce a pool of players in the coming weeks, then will likely select the Olympic team before training camp this summer. The Olympics start July 24.

"Joel Embiid describes the emotions behind wearing No. 24 on his jersey and how Kobe Bryant inspired his decision to play basketball. (1:59) PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid had to do it like the kids on the playground, a yell of ""Kobe!"" as he shot a fadeaway in the one-night-only No. 24 jersey he wore for his basketball idol. Embiid buried the bucket to give him a tidy 24 points -- and yes, eight defensive rebounds -- in a somber night in Philly dedicated to Kobe Bryant. Embiid returned early from a hand injury, in part to help the Sixers in their push for a better playoff seed in the East, but also because he wanted to honor Bryant. Embiid was a teen in Africa when he first got hooked on basketball watching Bryant in the 2010 NBA Finals. Bryant's style and swagger inspired the 7-foot Embiid to give up volleyball and convince his father he had a new direction in his promising athletic career. ""That was the turning point in my life,"" Embiid said. ""It was watching Kobe. After watching, I just wanted to be like him."" Wearing No. 24 in honor of Bryant, Embiid powered Philadelphia to a 115-104 win over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday. Embiid and the rest of the Sixers wore No. 24 and No. 8 Bryant jerseys in warmups in honor of the Los Angeles Lakers star, who was killed Sunday in a helicopter crash. Embiid was granted permission from Hall of Famer Bobby Jones to wear the retired No. 24 instead of his usual 21 for his first game since he tore a ligament in a finger in his left hand. ""It was tough but that's how you honor him, you go out there and you do your best,"" Embiid said. ""You work hard and you play through stuff."" The Sixers went 6-3 without Embiid, the first Sixer to be voted to three straight All-Star Games since Allen Iverson. Embiid had averaged 23.4 points and 12.3 rebounds in 31 games this season. Against the Warriors, Embiid played with a splint on his hand that didn't affect him when he buried a 3 that sent the Sixers into halftime with a 59-54 lead. ""For his first game back, it was pretty impressive,"" coach Brett Brown said. Philadelphia's Ben Simmons had ""Mamba Forever"" and ""RIP Gigi"" (for Bryant's daughter, among the nine killed in the crash) on each sneaker and scored 17 points. The Sixers were the latest team to honor Bryant in a pregame ceremony. Bryant led suburban Lower Merion High School to the Class AAAA state title at Hersheypark Arena in 1996, the school's first since 1943. His framed No. 33 Aces jersey was displayed at midcourt and the Sixers held a 33-second moment of silence of Bryant and the other eight victims in Sunday's crash. The Sixers rang a bell nine times and shone nine lights on the court during the solemn remembrance. The Sixers skipped pregame introductions for both teams and instead played a video of Bryant's last introduction in Philadelphia in a December 2015 game and images of him with Allen Iverson and Julius Erving. Yes, all teams have been affected by Bryant's death, but it struck particularly hard in Philly, where the former NBA star had a turbulent relationship with Philadelphia. His high school coach Gregg Downer spoke to the media for the first time earlier in the day, and wore Bryant's No. 33 Lower Merion warmup jacket. ""Once both teams got going, then it felt like a regular game again,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""But it took a little while."" The mood in the building also was tempered because the 10-win Warriors gave the Sixers a serious challenge. The Sixers were 12-point favorites but D'Angelo Russell, who scored a team-high 28 points, kept the Warriors within single digits for most of the fourth quarter. Al Horford buried a 3 and Shake Milton followed with another to push it to a 16-point lead and send the Sixers on their way to a whopping 22-2 record at home. REMEMBERING KOBE The Sixers also had a No. 33 logo next to the scorer's table, the names of the nine victims were displayed on the big screen, and Zhaire Smith swapped his usual No. 8 jersey for No. 7. The Sixers had retired No. 24 for defensive star and 1983 NBA champion Bobby Jones. Embiid called Jones for his blessing to use 24 for the night. ""I told Joel to play hard defense because that is what the No. 24 represents in my mind. I thanked him for the call, and I'm glad he and I had the chance to talk,"" Jones said in a statement. TIP-INS Warriors: The Warriors practiced Monday night at Drexel, where guard Damion Lee played for three seasons. The Warriors also have former Villanova stars Omari Spellman and Eric Paschall on the roster. Both players won national championships under coach Jay Wright. Kerr joked he enjoyed practicing at Drexel but ""maybe next year we'll go to Villanova, if Jay lets us."" 76ers: Brown said he didn't address Bryant's death immediately before Tuesday's game. ""I'm coming in tonight to win,"" Brown said. ""I think that's probably the greatest tribute you can pay to such an amazing competitor. I'm going to coach with that spirit."" WARRIOR WOES ""This season has to stand for something. We're obviously not going to the playoffs. We're not fighting for championships or division titles. It has to be about a season-long improvement, individually for the young guys, and collectively for the group. We've had our slip-ups, we've had some nights where it's been very frustrating, but all in all, can't argue with the overall effort these guys have given all season long."" -- Kerr, on the 10-win Warriors.","401161344"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry locked up another spot in Raptors franchise history and got a hearty congratulations from the high-flying star who was once the face of basketball in Toronto. Lowry had 12 points and 11 assists while becoming Toronto's career assist leader and the Raptors beat the Atlanta Hawks 130-114 Tuesday night for their season-best eighth straight win. Serge Ibaka had 24 points and 10 rebounds, Pascal Siakam added 24 points and Fred VanVleet had 19 as the Raptors won their 10th in a row over Atlanta. Toronto never trailed and led by as many as 28, maintaining a double-digit edge throughout the second half. With his ninth assist, a long outlet pass to Terence Davis in the fourth, Lowry moved past Jose Calderon (3,770) on Torontos career list. Lowry said it was special to reach the milestone with former Raptors star Vince Carter in attendance as a member of the Hawks. It was awesome to be able to get it here tonight, in front of the home crowd, in front of Vince, Lowry sad. He didnt start the organization but he kind of put it on the map and continued to make this thing grow. Hes always been a big supporter of mine and the Raptors. Lowry and Carter, who are friends and golf buddies, embraced near half court after the record was announced late in the game. Hes very crafty, hes very smart, Carter said of Lowry. His basketball IQ is up there with some of the best in my opinion. Calderon tweeted a congratulatory video to Lowry, who finished with eight rebounds and narrowly missed his second triple-double of the season. If somebody had to do it, Im really happy that its you, Calderon told Lowry. Enjoy this moment and many more. Lowry is already Torontos franchise leader in 3-point field goals and steals. John Collins had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and Trae Young had 18 points and 13 assists for the Hawks. Cam Reddish also scored 18 points, DeAndre Hunter had 15 and Carter added 10 as Atlanta lost for the fourth time in six games. We could have made this game a little bit different with the defensive intensity, Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. We lacked that, really, because the shots werent falling and we let that affect us. Raptors center Marc Gasol scored 10 points but was unable to return after leaving early in the third because of a sore left hamstring. Gasol missed 12 games because of a strained left hamstring between Dec. 18 and Jan. 12. Toronto also lost forward OG Anunoby to a sore left shoulder late in the game. Coach Nick Nurse had no update on either of his injured starters following the game. TIP-INS Hawks: F Bruno Fernando (left calf) was inactive, C Alex Len sat for the second straight game because of a right hip flexor strain, and G DeAndre' Bembry missed his fourth straight game, the past three of which have been because of inflammation in his right hand. ... Toronto honored Carter with a video tribute between the first and second quarters. ... Young shot 1 for 7 from 3-point range. Raptors: Toronto didnt turn the ball over in the second and had just two turnovers in the first half. ... F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (sprained right ankle) was inactive. Hollis-Jefferson left Sundays win at San Antonio in the second quarter and did not return. ... F Patrick McCaw (broken nose) missed his third straight game. ... The Raptors outscored the Hawks 61-26 in bench points. LOST LEGEND Playing at home for the first time since Kobe Bryant's death Sunday, the Raptors honored the late star with a pregame video tribute. Fans rose for an impromptu standing ovation and yelled Kobe, Kobe! following the video before the scoreboard counted down 24 seconds of silence. 81 When the Hawks reached 81 points late in the third, the digits were displayed in purple on the scoreboard in tribute to Bryant, who scored a career-high 81 against Toronto on Jan. 22, 2006. The plan was to highlight the numbers 8, 24 and 81, but neither team hit on any of them until the Hawks got to 81 on Youngs layup. MOVING ON UP Carter played his 1,522nd game, tying Dirk Nowitzki for third on the NBAs all-time list. Only Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) have played in more.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies have improved greatly since a month ago, and they showed that off against the Denver Nuggets. Dillon Brooks scored 24 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 23 points and 12 rebounds, and the Grizzlies beat Denver 104-96 Tuesday night for their third straight win. The previous two games in the series this season were won by Denver, including a 131-114 victory back in November. This time, Memphis led wire-to-wire, jumping ahead by as many as 19. It was the first time this year the Grizzlies have led from start to finish, and Memphis now has a 2 1/2-game cushion over San Antonio for the eighth and final spot in the Western Conference playoff race. ""I felt like our energy just stepped up, pressuring the ball,"" said Ja Morant, who had 14 points, including 10 in the fourth quarter. ""... We just try to get stops, forcing them into shots we want them to take, rebound and just run."" As evidence that the strategy worked, Memphis outscored the Nuggets in the paint -- 76-22 -- and had 19 fastbreak points to Denver's nine. Jaren Jackson Jr. had 10 points and blocked a career-high seven shots. ""They dominated the transition game,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""They had 19 fastbreak points, They had 76 points in the paint, which is a joke. Then Dillon Brooks, being an X-factor, he went out and got 24 points."" Denver's Nikola Jokic had 25 points and 13 rebounds for his 22nd double-double in 28 games. Jerami Grant had 21 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter as the Nuggets tried to cut into Memphis' lead. For the most part, they were unsuccessful. Memphis held a 16-point edge near the midway point of the fourth quarter as Valanciunas provided a burst with seven straight points. Denver crafted a short rally but got no closer than seven points in the closing minute. Memphis' defense held the Nuggets to under 38% from both the field and 3-point range, and Denver was held under 100 points for the first time in 25 games. ""We had a lot of failed possessions,"" Jokic said. ""Defense was not what it was supposed to be. We were living in the paint. They would blow by us."" The Grizzlies extended their lead to 19 early in the third quarter by beating the Nuggets down the floor. Memphis outscored Denver 19-16 in the low-octane period, but the Grizzlies still held an 82-66 lead heading to the fourth. ""I think we're in tunnel vision for the next step ahead,"" Jackson said. ""We're not really trying to settle or anything like that. We might do that eventually."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Played without Jamal Murray (left ankle sprain), Paul Millsap (left knee contusion) and Mason Plumlee (right cuboid injury). ... Denver's 24-game string of 100-plus-point games was the longest since a 38-game run in 1990-91 . ... Rookie Michael Porter Jr. was held to eight points. He had reached double figures in seven straight games in which he played. Grizzlies: Jae Crowder and Grayson Allen were out for the Grizzlies. ...

NOT YET Nuggets coach Michael Malone had praise for Morant but says he is not among the elite yet. ""I think he's a hell of a player,"" Malone said in the pregame comments.

"MILWAUKEE --  Khris Middleton dedicated the best game of his career to Kobe Bryant. Middleton scored a career-high 51 points, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to a 151-131 victory over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. Middleton, hoping to be chosen an All-Star reserve for the second straight year on Thursday, helped the Bucks hold off a determined second-half Wizards rally. Middleton also had 10 rebounds and six assists while hitting 16 of 26 shots and 7 of 10 3-pointers, topping his previous career best of 43 points. He said he was thinking a lot the past few days about Bryant, who was killed along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others in a helicopter crash Sunday. ""Kobe was one of my favorite players growing up besides (Michael) Jordan,"" Middleton said. ""I took a lot from his game. Everybody says Mamba mentality. To go out there and put on that type of performance, I definitely can dedicate that game to him as a thank you for what he did for the game."" Milwaukee (41-6) scored a franchise-record 88 points in the first half, finished with its highest total of the season and won its ninth straight game despite the absence of star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who sat out with a right shoulder injury. Bradley Beal led the Wizards (15-31) with 47 points, his second straight 40-point game and sixth of the season. ""We didn't show any resistance early in the game,"" Beal said. ""Then in the second half we were a totally different team. We got aggressive. We were physical on defense. We were physical on offense, attacking."" Milwaukee led from wire to wire and by as many as 32 points but the Wizards rallied in the third quarter, putting up 41 points to cut their deficit to 117-104 entering the fourth. Washington got within seven points in the final period but could not get closer. Eric Bledsoe had 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds for the Bucks. Donte DiVincenzo added 16 points and a pair of late 3-pointers to clinch the victory. Middleton responded with 13 points in the fourth quarter as he scored the most points by a Bucks player this season. He pounded home a dunk to reach 51 points and give the Bucks a 13-point lead late in the final quarter. ""He's an All-Star,"" DiVincenzo said. ""He did it last year. He's doing it again this year. When we're struggling we just go to Khris. We have that confidence in him. He knows not to force it. He's an amazing player. He knows he can pick his spots and get others involved."" The previous high by a Bucks player this season came when Antetokounmpo had 50 points on Nov. 25 against Utah. The Bucks came out firing from deep, hitting eight of their first nine attempts from 3-point range. Milwaukee converted 14 of 22 shots in the first quarter on the way to a 42-28 lead. And they kept going in the second. Middleton hit his fourth 3-pointer of the half to give the Bucks a 69-43 lead with 5:46 left. Middleton nailed two more 3s to finish the half 6 for 6 from 3-point range and with 28 points. ""He got in a rhythm pretty early,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It was coming off his hand well. He had a good pop, a good bounce. I think everybody was feeding off him, celebrating him because he's such a good player and such a good teammate."" The Bucks sank 14 of 24 3-pointers in the half as they grabbed an 88-63 lead at intermission. The previous franchise mark for points in a half was 87 set against New Orleans on March 14, 1979. Milwaukee shot 56.6% from the field (50 of 90) and sank 19 of 37 3s. KOBE SALUTE The Bucks organization opened the night with 24 seconds of silence to honor Bryant, marked by a countdown on the 24-second clock above both baskets. The game started with a 24-second violation taken by the Bucks, with players on both benches standing and the crowd standing and applauding. The Wizards then took an 8-second violation as the teams honored Bryant, who wore jersey Nos. 24 and 8 in his 20-year career with the Lakers. STAR STATUS Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry said he believes the team should have at least three All-Stars when reserves are named Thursday for the Feb. 16 game in Chicago. Middleton seems a likely pick but Lasry made the case for point guard Eric Bledsoe and center Brook Lopez as well. The Eastern Conference coaches pick the All-Star reserves. Antetokounmpo was chosen as a starter and team captain. ""Khris absolutely deserves to be an All-Star,"" Lasry said. ""It gets tiring after a while. Everybody talks about how you should be a team and you should do things together. Here we are the best team. We're doing everything the right way. The Warriors had four All-Stars. When the Hawks were leading (the East), they had four All-Stars. The fact that we have to talk about Middleton and Bledsoe should be reserves. We should have Middleton, Bledsoe and Brook."" TIP-INS Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said he thinks the Bucks are better than they were last year, and he credits their painful six-game Eastern Conference finals loss to Toronto for that. ""They've got the championship hunger and they're ready,"" Brooks said. ""They obviously had a tough playoff series loss last year. Sometimes that helps. You have that chip; you have that scar that needs to be there. Not too many teams come together and win a championship the first go-round. They have everything. They're built to win a championship this year."" . Former Bucks player Gary Payton II came off the bench for the Wizards. Guard Jordan McRae (sprained right ankle) was not with the team after averaging 15.9 points in the past 18 games. Bucks: Antetokounmpo sat out with right shoulder soreness, but Budenholzer did not think it would be an injury to keep him out of the lineup too long. ""It's been bothering him for a few days actually,"" Budenholzer said. ""I guess there's a silver lining coming off the game in Paris. It's been three or four days since we played and it will be another couple until Friday (vs. Denver). So, he gets a good chance for his body to resettle a bit and hopefully his shoulder is in a better place by Friday."" If he returns Friday, Antetokounmpo will have played just one game in 10 days dating to last week . Backup center Robin Lopez returned after missing the trip to Paris due to illness and contributed 10 points in 16 minutes.","401161347"
"DALLAS --  All Devin Booker can do now is wait for the announcement of All-Star reserves. The last impression for the Phoenix guard was a good one. Booker scored 20 of his 32 points in a decisive third quarter, Deandre Ayton had a season-high 31 points and the Suns never trailed in a 133-104 dismantling of the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night. Eighth in the NBA in scoring, Booker is tied for fourth with Portland's Damian Lillard with 20 games of at least 30 points. They trail three All-Star starters in James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Trae Young. The reserves will be announced Thursday. ""It's exciting just to be in this situation,"" said Booker, who was 7 of 9 from the field in the third and 12 of 20 for the game. ""Every time I go out on the floor, I try to represent Phoenix, represent my last name in the best way possible and I think making All-Star would amplify that and give something that this city's been waiting on for a long time."" Booker started the scoring in the third quarter before the ball had even been thrown in, making a free throw after the last of three first-half technicals against Dallas was called against Tim Hardaway Jr. after the halftime buzzer. With the head start from Booker, the Suns outscored the Mavericks 48-22 in the third on their way to surpassing last season's win total of 19 with their fourth victory in the past five road games. It was the most points in a quarter for Phoenix since 1990, and the most the playoff-contending Mavericks have given up in any quarter in franchise history. ""This team has done so many things to get people excited about it and really worked hard to get into a solid position at this point in time,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""A performance like this is just tough. Nights like this do happen, but this was extreme."" Ayton, the 2018 No. 1 overall pick who has been overshadowed during his two seasons by Dallas sensation and third overall choice Luka Doncic, was 13 of 15 from the field as the Suns shot a season-high 59%. Ayton made all five of his free throws and had a game-high nine rebounds. Doncic, an All-Star starter, scored 21 points with six rebounds and just two assists before leaving the game for good with the Mavericks trailing by 36 with 8:05 remaining. He was the only starter in double figures for Dallas, which was just 7 of 33 from 3-point range. Doncic and Carlisle drew techs in the first quarter before Hardaway was called for one on his way off the floor not long after he was called for an offensive foul that Carlisle unsuccessfully challenged. Booker's free throw started an 8-0 run to open the second half and give Phoenix a double-digit lead for good after Dallas had trimmed a 13-point deficit in the first half to five (60-55) at the break. Now the Suns go home for the first time since the shocking death of former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash Sunday. ""It's been hard and it will be hard going forward, but I was just proud of the way our guys made plays for each other,"" coach Monty Williams said. ""I don't think anybody expected us to come in here and win the game."" TIP-INS Suns: Booker, who had nine assists and six rebounds, became the fourth-youngest player (23 years, 90 days) to score 7,000 points, after LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony. ... Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 19 points and six rebounds. ... Phoenix's previous high for a quarter was 43 in the first quarter of a 121-110 win at Golden State on Oct. 30.

The 7-foot-3 forward had nine points and three rebounds in 20 minutes. ... G Ryan Broekhoff played for the first time since breaking his left fibula at the Lakers on Dec. 29. KOBE TRIBUTES The Mavericks honored Bryant in a ceremony before their first home game since the crash that also killed his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others outside Los Angeles. Highlights of Bryant's career and some of his interactions with the Mavericks, including retired star Dirk Nowitzki, were shown on the video boards during a moment of silence. Nowitzki was courtside with owner Mark Cuban. Dallas' plan to retire the No. 24 in Bryant's honor was announced to cheers, and the teams repeated the tribute Dallas and Oklahoma City displayed a night earlier. The Mavericks took an 8-second backcourt violation to honor Bryant's other number, followed by a 24-second shot clock violation by the Suns. DALLAS DEBUT Willie Cauley-Stein made his Dallas debut after coming over in a trade with Golden State, getting four points and three rebounds in 12 minutes, most of them coming with the outcome decided in the fourth quarter.","401161348"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo opened the night by smiling and waving to Pacers fans in his return from a lengthy absence due to injury. He finished it by walking off the court in tears. The two-time All-Star capped his first contest in more than a year by making a game-tying 3-pointer with 10 seconds left, and the Indiana Pacers went on to beat Chicago Bulls 115-106 in overtime. ""I just shot it. Mamba mentality, man. Mamba mentality,"" Oladipo said, his voice cracking. ""That's for Kobe (Bryant) and all the people that were on the helicopter."" Oladipo returned for the first time since last January, when he left the court on a stretcher with a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee. He spent the next 12 months fighting his way through what he called excruciating pain. Before the game, coach Nate McMillan said Oladipo would come off the bench, be limited to 24 minutes and not play in back-to-back games. That will remain the plan until after the All-Star break. At times, Oladipo understandably looked rusty and out of sync. But when his team needed it most, the Pacers' biggest star delivered on a night full of emotion. As he sat on the scorer's table with 4:12 left in the first quarter, following a video tribute that featured his long journey back, Bulls coach Jim Boylen walked over and shook Oladipo's hand. When Oladipo entered the game, the roaring sellout crowd held up gold placards that read ""Ready 4 Action."" Even Bulls players were applauding. Oladipo scored nine points and had four assists and two rebounds in 21 minutes, going 2 of 8 from the field and 1 of 7 on 3s. But it was the one 3 that capped a 7-0 rally over the final 2 1/2 minutes of regulation and tied the game, providing the jolt of energy Indiana desperately needed. Malcolm Brogdon scored seven of his 15 points in the extra period. ""We wanted to do it for him,"" Brogdon said. ""We knew how much energy was going to be in the building tonight. There are going to be bumps, but we're going to be able to get through them."" Zach LaVine had one chance to win it with a 7-foot runner at the end of regulation, but he lost the ball on the way up and it rolled out of bounds as the buzzer sounded. Brogdon took care of the rest. He scored five points in a 9-2 run to open the overtime then sealed the win with a dunk with 1:16 left. Brogdon had nine rebounds and eight assists. T.J. Warren had 25 points to lead the Pacers. Chandler Hutchison scored a career-high 21 points for the Bulls. LaVine added 20 for Chicago, which lost its eighth straight in the series. ""He's an elite player and I felt like I gave a pretty good contest,"" said Hutchison, who was defending Oladipo on the 3. ""I just have to make him put it down in that situation when the 3 is the only thing that could tie us. I'm going to learn from it and move on, but he hit a pretty tough shot."" TIP-INS Bulls: Thaddeus Young scored 16 points and Cristiano Felicio had 11 points and eight rebounds. ... Chicago was 6 of 33 on 3s and had 18 turnovers. .... The Bulls had a two-game winning streak end and have now lost eight straight in Indianapolis. ... LaVine has scored 20 or more points in 16 consecutive games, the longest streak of his career. ... The Bulls played without five injured players including Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr. and Otto Porter Jr. Pacers: Domantas Sabonis had 15 points, 11 rebounds, his 37th double-double this season. ... Justin Holiday finished with 13 points and Jeremy Lamb had 10 points and five rebounds. ... Rookie Goga Bitadze had 10 points. ... Indiana was 7 of 27 on 3s but made three of its last four. ... Warren has 23 games this season with 20 or more points. ... Myles Turner sat out with the flu. GETTING IN SYNC McMillan didn't expect Oladipo to be in top form Wednesday. The tougher part: Getting the Pacers re-acclimated to the new rotations that incorporate Oladipo. ""When a player gets hurt and someone steps into his role that's easier than stepping back. That's the trick,"" Boylen said. ""It's an interesting dynamic because it isn't often talked about, and it's different also when (the player) is a starter.""","401161350"
"NEW YORK --  It's only been a few days, not nearly enough for the players who were close with Kobe Bryant to get over his death. Unlike Sunday, Kyrie Irving was at least able to take his grief onto the basketball court. ""I couldn't even come up with wanting to play that game,"" Irving said. ""It was so heartbreaking, and it still is. I'm doing my best."" He scored 20 points in his return to the lineup Wednesday night, Spencer Dinwiddie scored 28 points in his first game with his new jersey number, and the Brooklyn Nets beat the Detroit Pistons 125-115. Irving didn't play Sunday at New York after learning of Bryant's death, and Dinwiddie, a Los Angeles native, was in tears after that game talking about what the Lakers star meant to him. ""I think I had still the had the emotion but I'm not going to put all that on this situation,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Our goal of our team is just to come together and try to progress throughout the season."" Dinwiddie changed his number from No. 8, one of the numbers Bryant wore, to No. 26 on Tuesday. He said he picked the number by adding his birthday, April 6, with his son Elijah's April 20. Irving was friends with Bryant and appeared to be in tears during a pregame tribute to the superstar, when Bryant's numbers 8 and 24 were lit up on the court and on the overhead video screen that showed the longtime Lakers star's highlights. The Nets left two seats open with flowers on them at Barclays Center in honor of Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who were among the nine people killed in a helicopter crash Sunday. The pair sat in those seats near Brooklyn's bench for a Dec. 21 game against Atlanta. Gianna was a fan of the Hawks' Trae Young. Reggie Jackson scored 23 points during one the best games of his injury-plagued season and Derrick Rose had 22 for the Pistons, who have lost four straight. Pistons coach Dwane Casey was upset with the Pistons' poor starts to both halves and was particularly disappointed in rookie Sekou Doumbouya, who was scoreless in eight minutes. ""We've got to figure it out,"" Casey said. ""We've got to figure out five or six or seven men that's going to come in and compete at a high level, no matter what your contract says. We've got to find them."" Dinwiddie had two 3-pointers and a couple other baskets during a 12-4 spurt early in the fourth quarter, turning a four-point lead into a 111-97 Brooklyn advantage. Taurean Prince scored 22 points for the Nets, who won for just the second time in eight games, both against the Pistons. They won at Detroit in overtime Saturday behind 45 points from Irving. The Nets raced to a 16-4 lead in less than five minutes, but Detroit cut it to 32-30 by the end of the first quarter. Jackson scored 14 points in the second and Dinwiddie had 12 as Brooklyn took a 70-68 lead to the half, tying its season high for points. TIP-INS Pistons: Rose, who missed Detroit's last game with knee soreness, had his 13th straight game with 20 or more points. ... Tony Snell returned after a three-game absence with an illness to score six points. Nets: Starting guard Garrett Temple had to leave in the first half to get stitches above his left eye. ... The Nets hosted Chinese cultural night, with their starting lineup announced in Chinese. Brooklyn players wore red shooting shirts before the game with the name Bryant on the back. NEW NUMBERS The game featured two of the players who have changed uniform numbers that Bryant wore. Besides Dinwiddie, Detroit's Markieff Morris swapped No. 8 for No. 88. Neither team has a No. 24. SEKOU'S STRUGGLES Doumbouya was 0 for 2 and the Pistons were outscored by 20 points in his brief time on the floor. ""Our rookie, seven minutes, minus-20,"" Casey said. ""I don't know how bad you have to play to get that many, so we got to get that fire lit under him a bit more because he's lost that zest, that fire that he had.""","401161351"
"NEW YORK --  The New York Knicks are fed up with the way Memphis Jae Crowder goes about playing the game of basketball. Down 18 points with 48 seconds left in regulation, Elfrid Payton ran up to Crowder and shoved him into the first row of the courtside seats after the veteran forward shot and missed a wide-open 3-point attempt. ""I think the dude (Crowder) plays the game a different way. He's got a lot of female tendencies on the court, New Yorks Marcus Morris Sr. said. Flapping and throwing his head back the entire game. This is a man's game and you just get tired of it."" A short time later, Morris apologized for his initial comments. ""I apologize for using the term 'female tendencies,'"" Morris posted on Twitter. I have the upmost respect for women and everything they mean to us. It was a Heat of the moment response and I never intended for any Women to feel as though in anyway I'm disrespecting them. Again I apologize for my comments. The confrontation cast a shadow over a strong performance by Dillon Brooks, who scored 27 points, and Ja Morant, who had 18 points and 10 assists, as the Grizzlies cruised to their fourth straight victory, beating the Knicks 127-106 on Wednesday night. Payton admitted he would do it all over again and knock Crowder, or any other player, to the ground if they attempt to tack on points with the game out of reach. ""That shot was disrespectful, Payton said. ""I'm standing on that. I'd a did it again. Doesn't matter who took that shot. Don't disrespect the game like that."" Tempers flared just moments after Brooks hit a 3-pointer that extended the lead 124-106 and celebrated near the Knicks bench. On the ensuing play, Julius Randle stood underneath the basket and passed the ball to an unaware Payton, who had his back turned. The ball bounced loosely on the floor and Crowder picked it up and ran towards the 3-point line. Crowders shot bounced off the rim as he was sent crashing towards the seats. Fortunately, most of the area where Crowder landed was unoccupied after the fans had filed out of Madison Square Garden before another loss was final in a what has turned out to be another disappointing season for the Knicks. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins, who appeared to have been shoved by one of the Knicks players while trying to play peacemaker, credited the officiating crew for quickly restoring order. Obviously it can be whole lot worse, but a lot of credit to (the referees), Josh (Tiven) and Ray (Acosta) and Ashley (Moyer-Gleich) for handling that really well, Jenkins said. Crowder, who was ejected, did not address the media after the game. Morris Sr. was also ejected for instigating the fight. Payton was assessed a flagrant 2 foul, which carried an automatic ejection. The bottom line is we lost our composure in there and we gotta do a better job in those situations, Knicks interim coach Mike Miller said. The victory put Memphis at .500 (24-24) for the first time in almost 13 months. Jonas Valenciunas had 12 points and 13 rebounds and Crowder finished with 18 points and eight assists for the Grizzlies, who have won 11 of their last 13 games. Randle had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and Payton finished with 15 points and 11 assists for New York, which has lost seven of 10. Coming off a home win over Denver on Tuesday night, Memphis distanced itself from New York by scoring seven straight points to start the third quarter for a 66-52 lead. The Grizzlies increased their lead to 82-60 on three free throws with 6:62 left in the period after Knicks reserve guard Reggie Bullock protested a foul call as Morant went up for a shot and picked up a technical foul. It was Morants first game in The Garden in what has been an emotional week for the Memphis star rookie, who was saddened by Kobe Bryants death on Sunday. Playing in the same arena where Bryant once scored 61 points on Feb. 2, 2009, Morant wowed the crowd, finishing an alley-oop dunk early in the game as he displayed his offensive and athletic abilities. I felt like everybody knows Madison Square Garden is a place to play, he said. Just happy to be able to go out here with my teammates and get a win. New York cut the lead 96-86 on a pair of free throws by Wayne Ellington to start the fourth quarter. Memphis then pulled away with a 7-0 spurt, moving out to a 103-86 lead on a layup by Jackson Jr. with 9:56 left in regulation. Brooks finished the first half with 19 points, shooting 7 for 10 from the floor, to help the Grizzlies build a 59-52 lead at the end of the second quarter. TIP INS Grizzlies: The last time Memphis had a .500 record was Dec. 31, 2018, following a loss at Houston that evened their record at 18-18. The defeat was the second of six straight.  Each starter finished in double figures. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 10 points.  Reserve Brandon Clarke had 17 points. Knicks: Marcus Morris scored 17 points. ... Miller said point guard Frank Ntilikina did not play because of a groin injury.","401161352"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Two days after missing a critical free throw, DeMar DeRozan stepped to the line and put the game away for the San Antonio Spurs. DeRozan scored a season-high 38 points and San Antonio held on for a 127-120 victory over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night, snapping a three-game losing streak. This season has tested DeRozan's resolve as he has whiffed on several late shots and free throws, including missing the second of two free throws with 0.2 seconds remaining in a 110-109 loss to Chicago on Monday. Still, the 30-year-old has maintained a shooter's mentality. ""When you're in that situation again, you know what you're supposed to be doing,"" DeRozan said. ""Knock down free throws, that's how you've got to think. You can't dwell or let the previous shot get you down or you're going to overthink it and miss shots in that same moment."" DeRozan had 21 points in the second half against Utah, including a pair of mid-range jumpers from the right baseline in the final 3 minutes to help seal the victory. He also was 3 for 4 on free throws in the final 50 seconds. ""We defended him,"" Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""He hit tough shots."" DeRozan was 11-for-19 shooting, surpassing 1,000 points for the 10th straight season and 16,000 points for his career. Mitchell had 31 points in 33 minutes and San Antonio native Jordan Clarkson added 20 points for the Jazz. Utah dropped into fourth in the West behind Denver. San Antonio had a prolific start despite the absence of LaMarcus Aldridge, who missed his second straight game with a sprained right thumb. ""Everybody contributed tonight,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We made adjustments and we had guys on the same page, where usually if we make a lot of adjustments there's a couple of guys that are not in the same arena."" Patty Mills had 18 points and Dejounte Murray 16 points for the Spurs. The Spurs led 70-62 at the half, their second-highest total in the first half this season. It was also the second-most points the Jazz have allowed in the first half. ""We started the game too soft,"" Utah center Rudy Gobert said. ""These guys got confidence early and when you give confidence to these guys they can be pretty good. I feel like we played better second half, but it was a little too late."" TIP-INS Jazz: Utah's coaching staff and players grew agitated when official Tre Maddox whistled for a timeout as point guard Mike Conley was dribbling up court. Officials conferred and ruled it was an inadvertent whistle after Conley and Utah coach Quinn Snyder denied calling a timeout. . Clarkson had 25 points, four rebounds and three assists in his previous outing in San Antonio while still playing Cleveland. The Cavaliers traded Clarkson to Utah on Dec. 23 for Dante Exum. . Utah's entire roster was healthy and available. Spurs: San Antonio has led by 10 points or more in 55 percent of its games. The Spurs are 17-9 in those games. . Jakob Poeltl picked up two fouls in the game's first 2 1/2 minutes, forcing coach Gregg Popovich to insert seldom-used Chimezie Metu. Poeltl would not pick up another foul while scoring four points in 22 minutes. CAREER NIGHT DeRozan was humbled to learn he had surpassed 16,000 career points. He joins Aldridge, LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry to reach that milestone since 2009. ""It's incredible,"" DeRozan said. ""Coming from Compton, always dreaming of playing in the NBA. Now, having 16,000 points is just an honor. My health, being able to play in this game for a long time and be able to compete at a high level every single night and being in position to go out there and be the type of player that I am."" OFF THEY GO The Spurs host Charlotte on Saturday before embarking on their annual Rodeo Road Trip. The nearly month-long excursion is necessitated by the AT&amp;T Center preparing for and hosting the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo. This season's trip consists of eight games in five states over 20 days, beginning Feb. 3 against the Los Angeles Clippers and ending Feb. 23 at Oklahoma City. San Antonio's next home game is Feb. 26 against Dallas.","401161353"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard laughed when asked about his first career triple-double. It's about time, he said. Lillard had 36 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Portland Trail Blazers spoiled James Harden's return after a two-game absence, beating the Houston Rockets 125-112 on Wednesday night. Lillard scored 30-plus points for his sixth straight game, a franchise record. ""It took eight years,"" he said about his triple-double. I think there's been plenty of times where I could have just hunted it -- I've been two rebounds or one assist away -- but it's just something I never wanted to go out there and just chase. CJ McCollum had 22 points and Trevor Ariza, playing in just his third game as a Blazer after a trade with Sacramento, matched his season high with 21. Portland led by as many as 20 points in the second half. The crowd roared at the Moda Center and gave Lillard a standing ovation when he got his final rebound on an offensive tip with under a minute left. Russell Westbrook led the Rockets with 39 points, extending his streak of games with 20-plus points to 21, and 10 rebounds. Harden, who was leading the league with 36.1 points a game this season, had 18. Because they've got one of the best offensive players, that just broke us down,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. You try to double, you try not to double, and he's shooting from almost half court."" Harden was questionable for the game but started after missing two games with a thigh contusion. Clint Capela missed Monday's game against the Utah Jazz because of a right heel contusion, as did Westbrook, who was rested. With three starters missing, Eric Gordon took over and scored 50 points in the 126-117 win in Utah. Earlier this month, the Rockets fell at home to the Blazers 117-107. Lillard had 25 points in the victory. Perhaps no other player in the league has been as hot as Lillard recently. He was the reigning Western Conference Player of Week after averaging 52.7 points and 9.3 assists last week. He set a franchise record for points when he scored 61 against Golden State. I didn't even know. I was wondering why he jumped that high for that rebound, McCollum laughed. He looked good. He's been locked in. This is the best basketball he's played in his career. Danuel House Jr., had a 3-pointer that gave the Rockets an early 16-8 lead, but Portland's 8-0 run, capped by Lillard's layup and free throw, closed the gap. Already beset by injuries this season, Portland got a scare in the opening quarter when center Hassan Whiteside was kneed and went to the locker room. He returned to the game. Westbrook's pull-up jumper and driving layup gave Houston a 46-38 lead. Portland used a 12-2 run, capped by a dunk by Ariza, to take a 61-50 lead. Portland closed the half with dunks by Ariza and Whiteside to take a 71-60 lead into the break. Lillard led all scorers with 25 points, while Westbrook had 19. McCollum's wide open 3-pointer midway through the third quarter gave the Trail Blazers an 83-67 advantage. Lillard's 3-pointer from just inside the pinwheel logo at midcourt made the lead 97-80. Im happy for him. Hes been playing great, Im glad they gave him that last tip as a rebound,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said about Lillard's night. ""To be honest, Im surprised he hasnt had one before now. He plays an all-around game, but to get your first triple double, on national TV against a really good team, its pretty cool. TIP INS Rockets: Houston's coaching staff wore Kobe Bryant Nikes for the game. It was the last of four road games in six nights for the Rockets. ... Harden and Westbrook were averaging 20-plus points this season, a first for the Rockets since Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady in the 2007-08 season. ... It was just the fifth time this season Harden had fewer than 20 points. Trail Blazers: Stotts and the Blazers' staff also wore Kobe Bryant Nikes for the game. ... Carmelo Anthony moved into 17th place on the NBA's scoring list, passing Kevin Garnett. ... Whiteside finished with 15 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks. DAD'S ADVICE Lillard said he's never chased triple-doubles because of his father. Just growing up, my dad would just always be on my case about playing the game the right way and letting it play out the way it's supposed to play out. So that's kind of been my approach to triple-doubles. Tonight, I was close but a lot of times I was like, alright, I can't walk off the court stuck at nine with all this time and everyone was like, `Get one rebound, get one rebound.'","401161354"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Still reeling from the loss of good friend and former NBA star Kobe Bryant, Oklahoma Citys Chris Paul returned to the basketball court for the first time since the tragedy because, he said, it was the right thing to do. The Thunder didnt need him much on a night in which they led from start to finish. But it was a therapeutic return for Paul. Probably the best thing (I) could have done is to get out there and play, Paul said following Oklahoma Citys 120-100 win over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. Kobe wouldnt have it any other way. Luguentz Dort set season-highs with 23 points and five 3-pointers, Dennis Schroder delivered another big game off the bench with 24 points and nine assists as the Thunder won for the sixth time in seven games. Danilo Gallinario had 19 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 17. A moment of silence was held before for the game for the victims of Sundays helicopter crash that killed Bryant and his daughter Gianna and seven others. A framed Bryant 24 jersey was placed at center court as a spotlight shined down. Some fans broke into chants of Kobe! Kobe! Kobe! after the buzzer sounded. Tributes to Bryant played on the video scoreboard throughout the game. Paul, who had nine points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, was back on the court after not playing in the Thunders loss to Dallas on Monday for personal reasons. He played only 26 minutes against the Kings, his fewest since Nov. 27. Although Paul penned an emotional tribute to Bryant on social media later on Monday, the nine-time All-Star had not spoken publicly about the tragedy until Wednesday. You just feel for the families, Paul said. Its a big loss for everybody. Dort had 12 points in the third quarter -- more than he has had in any game this season -- and helped the Thunder open a 20-point lead. Dort made a pair of 3-pointers, had a pair of layups and made two free throws after the Kings Nemanja Bjelica was called for a flagrant 1 foul. I actually told Dort toward the end of the game, Kobe probably would have been proud of him because he had 23 points and no assists, Paul said. Kobe was all about being aggressive and staying aggressive. Thunder coach Bill Donovan praised Paul for his management of the game. Obviously it was an emotional game for him, Donovan said. He never really got into a flow from the standpoint of his own personal offense, but he really managed to manipulate that game in the third quarter. He was finding guys, he was making the right decisions. He got guys open shots. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 23 points and DeAaron Fox had 19 for Sacramento. I felt we got pushed around tonight, Kings coach Luke Walton said. They were more physical than us, they hit us, they outrebounded us. They got the shots that they wanted and that cant be acceptable. The Thunder held the Kings to 16 points in the first quarter and led 59-43 late in the second following Schroders 3-pointer. Gilgeous-Alexander scored eight straight points to open the fourth quarter and Oklahoma City stretched its lead to 109-82. TIP-INS Thunder: Donovans team has won six straight on the road and is 13-3 away from home since the start of December.  This was the seventh time that Oklahoma City has made 15 or more 3-pointers this season.  Gallinari missed his first five shots and was 0 for 4 on 3s before connecting on back-to-back attempts in the second quarter. Kings: Sacramento missed eight of its nine 3-point shots in the first quarter.  Marvin Bagley III sat out a fourth straight game with left foot soreness. Bagley missed eight games from late December to early January because of the same issue. ... Richaun Holmes (right shoulder soreness) has missed 10 consecutive games.","401161355"
"Kyle Lowry believes there is no place for fans who engage in physical contact with players after Lowry was shoved courtside after diving for a loose ball. (0:35) CLEVELAND --  Toronto's ninth straight win didn't come easily. The Raptors nearly let a big lead slip away in the fourth quarter before holding on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 115-109 on Thursday night. Serge Ibaka scored 26 points, Kyle Lowry had 23 and Norman Powell made big plays down the stretch after Cleveland cut a 14-point deficit to 105-104. Powell came through with eight consecutive points in the final minute, hitting a 3-pointer, scoring on a layup after making a steal and sinking three foul shots to seal the win. ""That was anybody's game from start to finish, to be honest,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""You've just got to grind it out and find a way."" Powell's late-game flurry helped the Raptors stifle a comeback bid by the Cavaliers, who trailed 90-76 early in the fourth quarter. Cleveland trimmed its deficit to one on three occasions and had a chance to tie the game, but Darius Garland missed the second of two free throws with 1:18 to play, leaving Toronto's lead at 105-104. Lowry was selected as a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star team Thursday, the sixth time he'll appear in the game. Pascal Siakam, named an All-Star starter last week, scored 19 points and Powell had 16. The Raptors held a postgame celebration to honor Lowry's selection. ""It was cool, man, because I wouldn't be here without my teammates,"" he said. ""Those guys literally let me lead them and I love them for it. Being there with P (Siakam), it's going to be awesome."" Lowry said he was pushed by fan when he dove into the stands for a loose ball in the fourth quarter. Video showed Lowry landed on two fans and one appeared to press his hand on the guard's back as he returned to the floor. Lowry, who turned and looked at the fan as play continued, was pushed by a minority owner of the Goldden State Warriors in last season's NBA Finals when he dove into the stands under similar circumstances. ""I got pushed, and that's the second time it's happened to me,"" Lowry said. ""The next time it happens, I don't know if I'll be able to control myself. Fans like that shouldn't be able to lay any hands on you and shouldn't be a part of our game."" The Raptors are 34-14 despite losing Kawhi Leonard from last season's NBA championship team. Toronto trails only Milwuakee in the Eastern Conference. ""It wasn't just a tremendous player like Kawhi,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""They have a lot of the pieces that you need to win at the level they've been winning at."" Ibaka started in place of Marc Gasol, who is out indefinitely after re-injuring his left hamstring Tuesday against Atlanta. Kevin Love and Collin Sexton each scored 23 points for Cleveland, which has lost nine of 10 overall and nine in a row at home. Toronto scored 11 straight points late in the third quarter to go ahead 88-75. Lowry converted a three-point play, and Ibaka and Powell hit 3-pointers. Toronto pushed the lead to 100-90 before Cleveland rallied again. The Cavaliers haven't won at home since Dec. 23 when they defeated Atlanta. Cleveland committed 23 turnovers, with the most crucial coming on Powell's steal of a bad pass by Kevin Porter Jr. and fast-break basket, which pushed the lead to 110-104. The teams played twice in Toronto, with the Raptors winning both games by 20 points. TIP-INS Raptors: Gasol missed 12 games with the hamstring injury from Dec. 20 to Jan. 12. ... Ibaka made his 15th start of the season. . Toronto will end January with a winning record, marking the 21st straight month it has done so. The Raptors' last losing month was January 2017. Cavaliers: Garland scored 16 points after sitting out for rest purposes Tuesday. Beilein said Garland informed the staff that his legs had been feeling tired after starting the first 47 games. Garland played in just five games in his only season at Vanderbilt because of a knee injury. MAJOR PROGRESS Siakam averages a team-high 23.7 points per game and has made 37% of his 3-point attempts. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 6.0 points a game over his first two seasons before scoring 16.9 last season. ""He shows shades of Durant-like stuff out there at that size,"" Beilein said. ""I watched the San Antonio game and he started out with five 3s. That's something he didn't even do until last year. He can pass the ball. He defends. He's doing a lot of everything.""","401161356"
"WASHINGTON --  Shortly before his Washington Wizards played the Charlotte Hornets, Bradley Beal found out he'd been snubbed for the All-Star Game. Playing with an obvious chip on his shoulder, Beal -- who averages 28.6 points per game, sixth in the league -- had 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists to lead the Wizards past the Hornets 121-107 on Thursday night. Beal had been an All-Star the previous two seasons. He is usually quick to talk after games, win or loss, but was miffed enough about his omission that he left the locker room before it was open to reporters. He was 6 for 12 from 3-point range, including a 3 in the middle of a 13-0 run that gave Washington an 82-74 lead with 1:41 to play in the third quarter. Beal also made 14 of 15 from the free-throw line and scored more than 30 for the fifth straight game. ""He's an All-Star,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""He just did not get picked."" Miles Bridges led Charlotte with 23 points. Terry Rozier had 21. The Hornets have lost nine of 10 and 15 of 18. Thomas Bryant scored 21 points, Isaiah Thomas had 18 and Troy Brown Jr. scored 12 for Washington, which began a six-game homestand. Thomas, who has twice been an All-Star, voiced his displeasure with the selection process. ""Even though they didn't name him an All-Star, he's an All-Star,"" Thomas said ""It's so political. The NBA picks who they want, and that's just how it's always going to be. We have no (national) TV games. ... ""There's a few people on there that shouldn't be on there, and we know that.""

Washington, who had 15 points, left in the third quarter with a sprained right ankle. Wizards: F Rui Hachimura, who hasn't played for the last 22 games with a groin injury, could play Saturday against Brooklyn, Brooks said. ""I don't know if he's going to start right away,"" Brooks said. ""If things keep going well, the way (they) have been, there's a great chance."" Brooks will make a decision after Friday's practice. ... C Moe Wagner, who hasn't played since Dec. 10 with a sprained left ankle, could return sometime next week, Brooks said. ... F Davis Bertans was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter. ... Beal was also called for a technical late in the fourth quarter. DEFENDING BEAL Charlotte coach James Borrego noted that Beal had 36 free throws in his previous two games, and he wasn't pleased that Beal shot 15 more. ""You've got to be smart,"" Borrego said. ""You've got to be physical but you still got to be smart. Show your hands. You have to give him credit but we got to do a better job defending without fouling."" Beal had just two field goal attempts in the fourth quarter, and Bridges was frustrated with trying to guard him. ""It's hard but that's why I'm here in the NBA, to do that,"" Bridges said. ""It's my job. Unfortunately we didn't win the game but I think I did a pretty good job in the fourth quarter."" HONORING KOBE This was the Wizards' first home game since the death of Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others in a helicopter crash on Sunday. A video tribute was played, followed by 24 seconds of silence. Washington committed an intentional 8-second backcourt violation and Charlotte had a 24-second violation to begin the game in honor of the two numbers Bryant wore with the Los Angeles Lakers. Thomas Bryant, who began his career with the Lakers, is proud to share the last name of his childhood hero. ""I used to wear the No. 8 jersey all the time when I was younger, going to my dad's house. My dad had to force it off me because it had syrup stains and everything from eating. I never took it off,"" Bryant said. ""Just talking about today, it feels special.""","401161357"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young thought it was important for him to play up to his status as an All-Star starter. After all, the Hawks' point guard was matched against two of his All-Star teammates. I feel I needed to prove myself a little bit, Young said. Young fulfilled his goal, scoring 39 points and adding a career-high 18 assists to lead Atlanta past Ben Simmons and Philadelphia 127-117 on Thursday night, extending the 76ers' road woes. I think I managed the game pretty well tonight from start to finish, said Young, who's in his second season. I'm getting better every day. Young ranks third in the league with 29.4 points per game. He is second, behind the Lakers' LeBron James, with 9.2 assists per game. Young was dominant from the opening period, when he had 10 assists. After that, he was the focus of the 76ers' defense. I think we was too focused on what Trae was doing, Simmons said. Philadelphia's Tobias Harris said Young is a tough cover. Tonight he just carved us up,"" Harris said. He was their whole offense tonight. Young and Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, who had 21 points and 14 rebounds, are All-Star starters. Simmons, added to the Eastern Conference team  on Thursday as a reserve, scored 31 points to lead Philadelphia. Shake Milton had a career-high 27 points -- 14 more than his previous high -- but it wasn't enough to improve the 76ers' poor road record. Philadelphia, 22-2 at home, fell to 9-16 in away games. John Collins had 17 points and 20 rebounds for Atlanta. The 76ers, who began the night tied with Indiana for fifth place in the Eastern Conference, held their last lead at 21-20 against the Hawks, who are last in the conference. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown called a timeout early in the final period after Young's 3-pointer gave Atlanta a 106-94 lead. Apparently still unhappy with his team's defense, Brown called another timeout about one minute later after Young's floater pushed the lead to 14 points at 108-94, capping a 9-0 run. Philadelphia cut Atlanta's lead to 121-116 before Vince Carter, who had 14 points, sank two free throws. TIP-INS 76ers: Tobias Harris had 21 points and nine rebounds. ... Milton had 16 points in the first half, topping his previous career high -- 13 -- for a full game. ... Simmons (minor upper respiratory illness) was cleared following pregame warmups. Hawks: Young needed only one period to log his fifth consecutive double-double. He had 14 points and 10 assists in the first. ... Bruno Fernando (left calf) and Alex Len (right hip) were out as Atlanta again dealt with a lack of depth on its front line. G DeAndre Bembry (right hand) missed his fifth straight game. F Jabari Parker (shoulder) will be evaluated on Tuesday. ... Carter appeared in his 1,523rd game, breaking a tie with Dirk Nowitzki for third all-time. HONORING KOBE Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce and his assistants wore Kobe Bryant's Nike shoes during the game as their tribute to the retired Los Angeles Lakers great, who was killed Sunday in a helicopter crash. It's obviously an emotional time, Pierce said, adding his goal was trying to find ways to continue to honor and do what we can to keep the legacy of Kobe going. TECHNICAL The Hawks led by only two points before a key sequence at the end of the first half led to Young making five free throws after he was fouled by Harris, pushing the lead to 74-67. Harris was called for a technical foul before Brown called a timeout to request a coach's challenge of the call that Young was shooting a 3-pointer when fouled. Brown protested when it was announced the challenge was not possible because Young already had taken one free throw. Brown also was called for a technical foul. That was not a good moment of the game, Brown said.","401161358"
"The Celtics deliver an emotional tribute to Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and the seven other victims of the helicopter crash. (3:49) BOSTON --  After a week that began with Kobe Bryant's shocking death, Celtics forward Jayson Tatum walked into TD Garden longing to hear some good news. He got it on a night that included Boston's remembrance of the player Tatum said first made him want to pick up a basketball. Gordon Hayward scored 25 points and the Celtics earned their fifth victory in six games with a 119-104 win over the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night. Marcus Smart added 21 points, scoring 17 in the second half on a night when Boston became the latest team to offer a tribute to Bryant following his death in a helicopter crash. Tatum, who was named to his first All-Star team before the game, returned to the lineup after missing three games with a right groin strain. He finished with 20 points in 24 minutes. ""It's been a tough week,"" Tatum said. ""I feel like I ain't played in a month. It was fun to just be out there in front of our fans and just be out there with the guys. I missed it."" Tatum said he found out he'd earned the All-Star nod during pregame warm-ups. ""I wanted to cry,"" he said. ""I didn't cry. I might cry later, though. ... I've been watching the All-Star Game ever since I've been watching basketball. I would always get Kobe's All-Star jersey. I had aspirations of one day being in the All-Star Game. At 21 years old to make it a reality ... It's a special feeling."" D'Angelo Russell led the Warriors, who lost their fifth straight, with 22 points. Alec Burks scored 18. The Celtics trailed in the opening minutes of the first quarter, but closed out the final 5:48 of the period on an 18-7 run to edge in front. Boston led by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter. It was the Celtics' first home game since Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in Sunday's crash in Calabasas, California. In the pregame, rivalry took a backseat to remembrance of the Lakers star. It normally would be unheard of for any player associated with Boston's longtime nemesis to get a standing ovation in the Celtics' arena. It happened Thursday in honor of one of the NBA's greatest players. Bryant's No. 24 was illuminated in lights on the court as Celtics fans joined the organization for 24 seconds of silence. Then, following a video tribute that included cameos from current and former Celtics, the arena erupted in cheers. ""It was cool to see,"" Tatum said. ""He definitely deserves that."" Said Warriors forward Draymond Green: ""Just to see so many Kobe jerseys on these Boston fans was special."" TIP-INS Warriors: Outscored the Celtics 27-10 in fast break points. ... Were outrebounded 37-27. Celtics: Finished with 23 turnovers. ... Made seven 3-pointers in the third quarter after hitting four in the first half. ... C Enes Kanter missed his fourth straight game with a right hip contusion. YOUTH IS SERVED Tatum joined Walker as the Celtics' All-Star selections. Walker was voted in as a starter last week. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, at 21 years and 333 days Tatum is the second-youngest Celtics player selected to an All-Star game behind Antoine Walker, who was 153 days younger. Tatum wore sneakers from Bryant's Nike collection during pregame warmups.","401161359"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic is raising another aspect of his game -- his voice. Always a leader by example, he's now speaking up more. And his teammates are listening, too. Jokic scored 28 points, including six in the final two minutes, and dished out 10 assists as the short-handed Denver Nuggets rode a big second-half run to a 106-100 win over the Utah Jazz on Thursday night. He always sets the temperature for us,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. If he's getting down, if he's dejected, that's going to trickle down to everybody else. I love his positivity, his encouraging guys. That's impactful, when you have your best player doing that. The Nuggets needed a boost. Jokic led the charge, scoring 11 of Denver's final 12 points. Trailing 70-61 with 4:13 left in the third, the Nuggets went on a 15-0 spurt to close out the quarter. They continued their roll in the fourth. In all, it was a 27-1 surge -- and nearly wasn't enough. A 17-point Denver lead was whittled to three before Jokic took over. The big man who just made his second All-Star team hit a pair of free throws, a long jumper and a floater to restore some breathing room. To me, this might be our best win of the year, Malone said. Jordan Clarkson scored 24 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter for the Jazz on a night when leading scorer Donovan Mitchell was held to four on 1-for-12 shooting. He didn't get his first basket until there was 4:05 left. Mitchell was selected to his first All-Star Game earlier in the evening. He gave his defender, Torrey Craig, full credit. He made it tough on me, Mitchell said. ""He always does. I can't sit here and say 'Oh, I was tired.' He did his job."" Craig simply tried to not let Mitchell get on track. He's a great player,"" Craig said. ""If he gets in a rhythm, it can be hard to stop him. This marked the first of four meetings between the Northwest Division rivals. The Nuggets (33-15) moved a game clear of the Jazz (32-16). Jokic carried the load for a Denver team that was missing Jamal Murray (sprained left ankle), Paul Millsap (bruised left knee), Gary Harris (personal reasons) and Mason Plumlee (right foot). Michael Porter Jr. finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. Utah center Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 11 rebounds after making his first All-Star team. The Jazz have dropped three straight. We stalled for a lot of reasons, coach Quin Snyder said. It was difficult for us to attack. I think we have to have more resolve. We're a team where guys make plays for each other and we weren't able to create for one another. Down by as many as 11 in the third quarter, the Nuggets took a lead they wouldn't relinquish on a 3-pointer by Porter with 29.1 seconds left in the period. P.J. Dozier followed with a buzzer-beating 3 to end the third and extend the advantage. We didn't quit, Jokic said. TIP-INS Jazz: G Mike Conley sat out as part of injury management due to right knee soreness. ... Joe Ingles and Mitchell each had eight assists. Nuggets: Craig said he was fine after falling when he tried a dunk attempt and was hit from behind by F George Niang, who was called for a flagrant-1 foul. ... Craig had 13 points and 10 rebounds. WORDS Ingles was walking off the floor, unrolling the tape around his wrist, when something a fan said caught his attention. They were quickly separated. LETTER FROM MOM Mitchell found out he made his first All-Star team through a letter from his mom that he read on the team's Twitter account. The opening line was, ""If you're reading this letter, it's because you're now an All-Star."" Mitchell laughed and leaned back in his chair as he digested the words. He later called her. ""It's just one of those things growing up, I didn't expect to be in the NBA,"" Mitchell said. Such a blessing. TRICKY STRETCH Malone doesn't particularly care for this back-to-back -- a late game against Utah on Thursday, followed by a trip to Milwaukee to face Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks on Friday. ""The back-to-back is criminal,"" Malone said. ""Our itinerary has us arriving at the hotel at 3:30 (a.m.). The itinerary is never right. We'll be in after that. We can't change the schedule. Not any of the 30 NBA teams are happy with their schedule, from Game 1 to 82.","401161360"
"LOS ANGELES --  De'Aaron Fox and the Sacramento Kings knew it was going to be an emotional night in Los Angeles. They responded with one of their best games this season. Fox scored a career-high 34 points and the Kings made a franchise-record 21 3-pointers in a 124-103 victory over the Clippers on Thursday. It was the first basketball game at Staples Center since Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in Sunday's helicopter crash in Southern California. Paul George narrated a 2-minute video tribute shown before the game while Bryant's retired No. 8 and No. 24 Lakers jerseys were left uncovered in the upper left corner of the arena. ""I'm really proud of the way our guys played,"" said Kings coach Luke Walton, a teammate of Bryant's on championship teams with the Lakers. ""We came in down and tired after playing last night (a 20-point loss to Oklahoma City) and then came into an emotional situation in what has been a very tough week."" Buddy Hield added 19 points and Cory Joseph had 16 as the Kings took control in the second quarter. The 21-point margin tied for the Kings' largest victory of the season. Walton praised Fox for doing a nice job of setting the tone early. The third-year guard said he concentrated on coming out aggressive, especially after Wednesday night's struggles. ""In most games I haven't started off well early, but I wanted to try and come out and stay in attack mode,"" Fox said. Lou Williams scored 22 points and Montrezl Harrell had 21 for the Clippers, who were without Kawhi Leonard. The All-Star forward was scratched after pregame warmups due to a lower back strain. Coach Doc Rivers said Leonard's back locked up late in warmups. Leonard tried stretching to get it loose but couldn't during the first half. When asked if he was concerned the injury could linger, Rivers said it was too early to know. George returned after missing the previous nine games due to a left hamstring strain and scored eight points in 19 minutes. ""Sacramento played last night and were in very good rhythm. We were clearly flat in every area. It was tough basketball-wise,"" Rivers said. The Clippers led 33-28 at the end of the first quarter but Sacramento seized control in the second, outscoring Los Angeles by 22 to take a 64-47 advantage at halftime. Joseph led the way with 12 points in the period as he went 4 of 6 on 3-pointers. Nine of the Kings' 13 field goals in the quarter were from beyond the arc. The Kings -- who have won three of four following a six-game losing streak -- scored eight straight points to start the second and never trailed after that. JaMychal Green's 3-pointer with 7:54 remaining drew the Clippers to 42-40 before the Kings went on a 22-4 run to put it out of reach. Joseph had nine points and Fox scored eight during the spurt as Sacramento was 8 of 12 from the field compared to the Clippers making only two of 14. Los Angeles got within 13 in the fourth quarter before the Kings pulled away again. Their largest lead was 23 later in the period on Fox's breakaway dunk. TIP-INS Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic had 15 points and Dewayne Dedmon added 11 points and 11 rebounds. ... Marvin Bagley III will be out at least three more weeks due to left foot soreness. The second-year forward has played in only 13 games this season due to a myriad of injuries. Clippers: Landry Shamet scored 15 points and Patrick Beverley had 11. ... It was the 13th game Leonard has missed this season but the first not due to his left knee. George and Leonard have played together in only 18 of the Clippers' 48 games. The last time it happened was Jan. 2 against Detroit. George missed 11 games at the beginning of the season after having shoulder surgery last summer. Then he was out 10 of the last 11 due to his left hamstring.","401161361"
"DETROIT --  The honors and accolades keep rolling in for coach Nick Nurse and the Toronto Raptors. Pascal Siakam scored 30 points and Serge Ibaka added 21 to lift the Raptors to their 10th straight victory, 105-92 over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. With the win, Toronto clinched a trip to the All-Star Game for Nurse and his staff, who will coach Team Giannis. ""We get to be the beneficiaries, I think, of kind of an organizational award,"" said Nurse, who led the Raptors to the NBA title last year in his first season as coach. ""It's certainly a tremendous honor for us, but there's a lot that goes into it, and it should be a really enjoyable experience for our guys."" Siakam was voted an All-Star starter, and Toronto guard Kyle Lowry was chosen as a reserve. The Raptors (35-14) are assured the best record in the Eastern Conference among teams with an eligible All-Star coach through this Sunday's deadline. Milwaukee has the top mark in the East but Mike Budenholzer is ineligible because he coached in the All-Star Game last year. Siakam made his first five shots from the field and scored 13 points in the first quarter, when the Raptors quickly built their lead into double digits. They were mostly in control after that, handing the Pistons their fifth loss in a row. Fred VanVleet scored 16 points with nine assists and eight rebounds. Any chance at a triple-double went by the wayside after he was pulled with 5:01 remaining and the Raptors up 19. ""He was hatin' on me,"" VanVleet joked about Nurse. ""We got him in the All-Star (Game), he couldn't even leave me in."" Toronto is one win shy of its franchise record for consecutive victories. The Pistons are without Blake Griffin (left knee surgery), and Luke Kennard (bilateral knee tendinitis) also missed the game. Andre Drummond had 20 points and 20 rebounds for Detroit, but much of that came when the Pistons were well behind. Toronto led by 16 in the first half. It was 78-69 after three quarters, and then the Raptors went on an 18-5 run to start the fourth -- to the delight of their many fans who attended the game just a few minutes from the U.S.-Canada border. ""The only way to silence that is to win,"" said Detroit coach Dwane Casey, who was Toronto's coach before Nurse took over. ""That team has been built. It took a while to build it and it didn't happen overnight. We have to have a plan to get our team in that position, and that is what we are doing now -- there is a plan."" Drummond was scoreless in the first half but finished with his 41st game of at least 20 points and 20 rebounds. That's four shy of Bob Lanier's franchise record, but it's not clear if Drummond has time to reach that mark. He's been the subject of trade speculation. Detroit guard Derrick Rose made a late layup to finish with 21 points, his 14th straight game with at least 20. SELECTED Detroit's Svi Mykhailiuk was picked to play in the Rising Stars game Feb. 14 during All-Star weekend in Chicago. The 6-foot-8 Mykhailiuk, in his second season as a pro, has shown some promise for the Pistons. He scored 13 points Friday. Raptors rookie Terence Davis II expressed some dismay on social media at not being selected. ""This isn't my first time not being selected for something but I guess it's easy going undrafted to playing quality mins on a championship team huh,"" Davis said on Twitter. TIP-INS Raptors: Marc Gasol (left hamstring tightness), Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (right ankle sprain) and Malcolm Miller (neck strain) missed the game. ... Toronto won 11 games in a row from Feb. 26 to March 16, 2018, and in January 2016. Pistons: Detroit was outscored 66-28 in the paint.","401161362"
"Kyrie Irving discusses his 54-point night and how a couple early shots falling and ""Mamba mentality"" kept him going during the game. (1:39) NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving is attempting to process the death of Kobe Bryant by reflecting on the lessons his friend taught him. He put them to good use Friday and scored a season-high 54 points, making all 10 shots in the first half and 19 of 23 for the game, to lead the Brooklyn Nets to a 133-118 victory over the Chicago Bulls. It's an open wound, Irving said. But I think just coming out here knowing that this is a place where we connected on a deeper scale, it makes a lot of sense, what's happening. Irvings previous season high was 50 against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the season-opening 127-126 loss on Oct. 23. Irving is the first player in Nets franchise history to score 45 points in three games in a single season. Spencer Dinwiddie had 20 points off the bench and Taurean Prince chipped in with 16. Jarrett Allen and Garrett Temple contributed 12 and 11, respectively. A little bit was making shots, Dinwiddie said. It's all about taking care of your bodies, being locked in, kind of mentally pushing through some of fatigue because everybody's going to have it, and just keeping that focus. The Nets never trailed in their second straight win and third in their last four games, with Irving playing the lead role. He scored 16 points in the first quarter on 6-of-6 shooting, and by halftime he was up to 27 points. Irving capped it by scoring five points in the final 4.9 seconds, including a buzzer-beating 3 from the right side which gave the Nets a 73-57 lead. Irving also had help as Dinwiddie had 15 and Prince added 11 in the opening 24 minutes. My teammates were in the right spots, Irving said. They were being aggressive. When they're being aggressive like that, it makes my job a lot easier. One of Brooklyns two prized free agent signings along with Kevin Durant, Irving didnt miss his first shot from the field until 1:24 into the third, a twisting fadeaway mid-range jumper from the left side. Chicago, which trailed by as much as 21, fell to 19-32. Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 22. Luke Kornet finished with 19. Thomas Satoransky had 15, and Thaddeus Young had 14. Chicago lost Kris Dunn for the game with what appeared to be a knee injury on the very first possession. Bulls coach Jim Boylen said Dunn would fly to Chicago Saturday to be evaluated by team doctors. The Bulls cut Brooklyns lead to 105-99 on Coby Whites 3-pointer 1:17 into the fourth but that was as close as they would get. From that point, the Nets outscored Chicago 28-19. I thought we battled, Boylen said. ""NBA games are spurts games. Brooklyn, thats a spurt team and they got the final spurt. Irving made two free throws with 3:50 left to set his new season high as chants of MVP! MVP! rained down from the sellout crowd of 17,732 at Barclays Center. On the next possession, he knocked down a mid-range jumper. It felt incredible, Irving said. You just want to carry that over into the next game. TIP-INS: BULLS: Boylen made no bones about it: The Bulls are displeased that LaVine will not be inside the United Center during the All-Star Weekend festivities as an active participant. I am disappointed, we are disappointed that Zach LaVine was not selected to the team, Boylen said before the game. LaVine, in his fifth season, is averaging 25.1 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 4 assists for a Bulls team that came into the game in ninth place in the East. We feel hes an All-Star caliber player. Hes having an All-Star season, and hes obviously a huge part to what were building. But we respect the process. I believe in the process, and so does Zach. NETS: He would not define it as make-it-or-break-it, but Kenny Atkinson is cognizant of the significance of the Nets next nine games. This is starting to get money time, now, Atkinson said. The Nets are eighth in the East. But as Atkinson explained, it is difficult to assess what his team is because they have rarely been at full strength over the course of the first 47 games of the season. Now that were healthy, Atkinson said, We can get a real sample size of our squad. ... The fact that were pretty much whole except (for Durant) I think that is super important for our evaluation purposes.","401161363"
"HOUSTON --  Houston's small lineup played big on Friday night to give the Rockets a win over the Dallas Mavericks. James Harden scored 35 points, Russell Westbrook added 32 and the Rockets built a big lead and held on for a 128-121 victory. Harden grabbed a season-high 16 rebounds for a Rockets team playing with a starting lineup that had no player taller than 6-foot-6 with Clint Capela out with a bruised heel. Harden said it's fun to play with such a small lineup, but admitted it can be difficult, especially facing a team with a big man as good as Kristaps Porzingis. It's challenging, especially when you have to guard bigger guys,"" Harden said. Porzingis under the basket can bring the competitiveness out of you and you have to compete, and you have to be physical and that's when you rely on your teammates."" Harden faced Porzingis for the opening tip and said he doesn't remember lining up for that since he was in high school. The Rockets led by 16 points entering the fourth quarter on a night when Mavericks star Luka Doncic sat out with a sprained right ankle that is expected to keep him out at least six games. But the Mavericks started out the fourth quarter strong and got within four with about 5 minutes left. Austin Rivers made a 3-pointer to stretch Houstons advantage to 113-106 after that. Harden stole the ball from Porzingis seconds later and finished the fast break with a layup. But Dallas wouldnt go away and cut the lead to four twice after that with the second time coming with about 90 seconds left when Tim Hardaway Jr. was fouled on a 3-pointer and made the free throw for a four-point play. Harden made a 3-pointer to pad Houstons lead after Hardaways play, and the Rockets were able to hold on for the victory. Porzingis had 35 points and 12 rebounds as the Mavericks lost their second game in a row. In the end the 3s got us and it's hard fighting an uphill battle and getting back after being down by (16),"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. I like a lot of things but they're a good team and they force you into some tough situations."" Coach Mike D'Antoni said if Capela remains out and they need to go to the smaller lineup more often, they'll have to guard much better. You've got to hunker down and let's go and get in front of guys,"" he said. If we do that and we get conscientious about boxing out and getting back, we could make this lineup pretty good."" The Mavericks scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter, capped by a 3-pointer from Seth Curry, to cut the deficit to 101-92. Dallas was still down by nine when Harden entered the game for the first time in the fourth quarter with about 9 minutes to go. But his presence didnt stop the Mavericks charge. Dallas used a 7-1 spurt, with five points from Delon Wright, to get within 107-104 and make Houston coach Mike DAntoni call a timeout to try and get his team on track. Houston got its first field goal in almost 3  minutes after that when Harden made a 3-point play midway through the quarter. The Rockets had a five-point lead at halftime and had pushed it to 85-70 with 7 minutes left in the third quarter. Houston got 3-pointers from Danuel House, P.J. Tucker and Eric Gordon in that stretch and got two dunks after steals to help build the lead. Houston led by 17 later in the third before the Mavericks used an 8-2 run, with the first five points from Porzingis, to get within 94-83. But Westbrook took over after that, scoring the next five points before throwing an alley-oop to Ben McLemore, who finished with a dunk, to push the lead to 101-83. Westbrook smiled broadly and raised his arms to encourage the crowd to cheer when the Mavericks called a timeout after that play. TIP-INS Mavericks: Carlisle got a technical foul in the second quarter for arguing about a foul call. ... Hardaway had 15 points. ... Curry added 16 points off the bench. Rockets: Capela sat out for the second time in three games because a bruised heel that has bothered him for weeks. DAntoni said hes day to day with the injury. ... Houston scored at least 100 points through three quarters for the fifth time this season and improved to 34-0 when the team has scored 100 points before the fourth quarter under DAntoni. REMEMBERING KOBE The Rockets had a tribute to Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna Bryant and the seven others who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday before Fridays game. They played a video featuring clips of the Lakers star and his daughter with many current and former Rockets, before putting pictures of the nine victims on the screen and observing a 24-second moment of silence. Bryant wore No. 24 for the second part of his career with the Lakers. DONCICS INJURY Doncic was injured during a scrimmage in practice on Thursday and Carlisle said before the game that he'd be out until at least Feb. 10. Carlisle added that he expects that Doncic will be healthy in time to participate in the All-Star Game after he was selected to the team for the first time and voted a starter. Carlisle said the Mavericks expect to have an update on Doncic's condition on Feb. 8, which is the day of the sixth game.","401161364"
"Ja Morant remembers first seeing Zion Williamson doing a 360 windmill with the younger team, which led to Zion being moved up to the main AAU team. (1:04) NEW ORLEANS --  Zion Williamson even surprised himself when he vaulted upward to snare an overthrown alley-oop lob with his left hand, switched the ball to his right hand and laid it in before tumbling across the baseline. ""It was one of those things where I just tried to make something of it, hope somebody gets the rebound,"" Williamson began before turning his answer into a joke at the expense of teammate E'Twaun Moore. ""I was shocked it went in. But my biggest shock of the night, I think, is when E'Twaun dunked. He's definitely getting drug tested."" Williamson scored 24 points in a little less than 29 minutes, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Memphis Grizzlies 139-111 on Friday night in the first matchup this season between the NBA's top two draft picks. ""His activity was really good and he's still in the learning stages,"" said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who was wet from a locker room celebration honoring the coach's 500th career victory. ""He really tries extremely hard not to get in anybody's way."" Williamson was playing in just his fifth game since completing a three-month rehabilitation from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. He converted four alley-oop lobs into baskets, three of them on dunks. He also drove the baseline for a twisting two-handed dunk and put back several offensive rebounds. Newly selected All-Star Brandon Ingram scored 20 and Lonzo Ball hit five 3-pointers on seven attempts in his 19-point night for the Pelicans, who won their third straight while ending Memphis' four-game winning streak. Jrue Holiday added 18 points for New Orleans, which pulled to four games behind the Grizzlies for the Western Conference's final playoff spot with 33 games remaining. Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points for Memphis before fouling out with 8:11 remaining. Grizzlies rookie Ja Morant, taken second overall behind Williamson in last June's draft, scored 16 points. ""They played great and we weren't that good,"" said Grizzlies coach Tyler Jenkins, whose team was missing forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and guard Marco Guduric because of one-game suspensions for leaving the bench during an altercation against the New York Knicks in Memphis' previous game. ""We can do a better job guarding one-on-one regardless of who we have out there,"" Jenkins said. ""Give (the Pelicans) credit. They played with great force."" Little went wrong for the Pelicans, who shot 53.7%, made 15 3s and led by as many as 32 points in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Grizzlies: In addition the the Jackson and Guduric suspensions, Memphis's lineup was thinned further by the absence of forward Brandon Clarke, who was ruled out with a sore hip before the game. Clarke joined guard Grayson Allen (hip) and Bruno Caboclo (knee) as inactive. ... Forward Solomon Hill, who played the previous three seasons for New Orleans, got his third start of the season for Memphis and had six points, two rebounds and an assist in 25:42. .... Missed 11 of 26 free throws. ... Jae Crowder scored 15 points, Kyle Anderson 14 and Josh Jackson 13. Dillon Brooks and Tyus Jones each scored 10. Pelicans: Redick scored 16 points and Josh Hart 11, while Moore and Nicolo Melli each scored 10. ... Derrick Favors had 10 rebounds. ... Outrebounded Memphis 57-34, turning 16 offensive rebounds into 20 second-chance points. TOP PICKS Williamson and Morant, who are both from South Carolina and former AAU teammates, exchanged jerseys after the game. ""We never saw each other being the Nos. 1 and 2 pick, playing against each other (in the NBA) and swapping jerseys, Williamson said. ""You can't imagine stuff like that so it was a great moment."" Both were involved in one of Williamson's early highlights. Holiday stole the ball from Morant, initiating a fast break that led to Williamson throwing down an alley-oop lob from Ball. Later, Ball's turnover led to Morant's soaring two-handed dunk off Brooks' lob. POSITIVE INFLUENCE New Orleans outscored Memphis by 25 while Williamson was on the court, giving the celebrated rookie out of Duke the best plus-minus figure of any player in the game. ""With Zion on the court we're a great basketball team, honestly,"" Ball said. ""We're just happy to have him back.""","401161365"
"MILWAUKEE --  Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone couldn't have been any happier with a win than he was Friday night. Will Barton had 24 points and eight assists to lead the tired and short-handed Nuggets to a 127-115 victory that snapped Milwaukee's nine-game winning streak and handed the NBA-leading Bucks just their third home loss. ""It is our best win of the season,"" Malone said. ""I am so proud of our guys."" Malik Beasley scored 16 points for Denver. Nikola Jokic had 15 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and Michael Porter Jr. added 15 points and 11 rebounds as every member of the Nuggets that played scored in double figures. ""I've never seen that,"" Malone said. ""Will Barton was tremendous, Nikola, Jerami Grant seven blocks, Malik Beasley five 3s, you can go on and on and on. This was a true team win and a true testament to the character of this group."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for Milwaukee, finishing just shy of his fifth triple-double this season. Khris Middleton added 24 points for the Bucks, who hadn't lost at home since Dallas beat them 120-116 on Dec. 16. Porter said beating the NBA's best was huge. ""It is big,"" he said. ""The Bucks, they've got the best record in the NBA. I think they had won nine straight. They have a crazy good home record. So, to come in here and get this win on a back-to-back like this, big-time."" Porter noted the balanced effort, too. ""Everybody scored double figures,"" he said. ""I've never seen that."" Denver shot 7 of 13 on 3-pointers in the third while the Bucks were simply outhustled and lost their touch from behind the arc, going 2 for 8. After trailing by seven at halftime, the Nuggets took their first lead at 78-77 late in the quarter on a 3 by Beasley. Barton hit a jumper and Denver never lost the lead the rest of the way. ""The second half, they came out and were aggressive,"" Middleton said. ""They made tough shots."" Coming from behind has been a common theme for Denver lately. The Nuggets rallied from an 11-point deficit Thursday night in a 106-100 win over the Utah Jazz. They arrived at their hotel at 4:30 a.m. and were without two key starters Friday in Paul Millsap (bruised left knee) and Jamal Murray (left ankle sprain). But their bench responded in the first half behind 11 points from Porter and 10 from Juancho Hernangomez. ""Even though we are down guys and all that, our guys have a tremendous belief,"" Malone said. Denver (34-15) leads the Northwest Division and has won eight of 11. The Nuggets improved to 15-9 on the road. Antetokounmpo and his brother, Thanasis, made some personal history when they started together for the first time in the NBA to put some splash on the Bucks' Greek Heritage Night. Thanasis Antetokounmpo stole an errant pass with a minute gone, raced the length of the court and threw down a two-handed dunk that brought the crowd to its feet. Giannis Antetokounmpo flirted with a triple-double by the second quarter with 12 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Middleton added 16 points, going 4 for 4 from behind the arc. Eric Bledsoe chipped in with 10 points and the Bucks led 67-60 at the break. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed Tuesday's win with right shoulder soreness and hadn't played since putting up 30 points and 16 rebounds last Friday when Milwaukee beat the Charlotte Hornets 116-103 in Paris. TIP-INS Nuggets: Millsap missed his 13th consecutive game and Murray his ninth. Backup center Mason Plumlee (right foot) and guard Gary Harris (personal) also were out. Bucks: Milwaukee guards George Hill (left hamstring) and Donte DiVincenzo (left ankle) are both expected to miss a few games after getting hurt Tuesday against the Wizards. QUOTABLE ""I thought tonight we brought it,"" Porter said. ""We got in at 4:30 a.m last night. We started off a little sluggish, but we found the energy."" SIGH OF RELIEF Porter got tangled up under the Bucks' basket and fell awkwardly at 10:27 of the fourth quarter. He was helped to the bench and did not return. ""I'm good,"" he said. ""I think I just rolled my ankle, but I am good."" Malone thought the injury wasn't serious. UPDATE ON MURRAY The Nuggets want Murray back as soon as possible, but not at the expense of his health. ""I think that it is smart for us and prudent for us to kind of be patient and not rush him back,"" Malone said. ""When he's out there, I want him playing with confidence and not worrying about that ankle injury."" Murray is a key cog in Denver's offense, averaging 17.6 points and 4.1 assists in 40 games, all starts. IT'S ALL GREEK The Bucks' starters were introduced in Greek as part of the night's Hellenic celebration.","401161366"
"PHOENIX --  One day after Oklahoma City's Chris Paul earned his first All-Star selection in four years, the veteran point guard gave a good reminder of why he's still one of the NBA's best players. Paul ripped a steal away from Phoenix's Kelly Oubre Jr. and then made the go-ahead jumper with 1:03 left, and the Thunder held on for a 111-107 victory over the Suns on Friday night. It was another big moment in a surprisingly successful season for Paul and the Thunder. They've won seven straight road games and have a 30-20 record, including a 24-9 mark since Thanksgiving. A big reason for those wins is Paul's continued excellence, even at 34 years old. ""It's been special. It's been a lot of fun,"" Paul said. ""Our team has been unbelievable and that's been the best part about it. It's always an honor and privilege to be named an All-Star, especially after not doing it for four years."" Danilo Gallinari led Oklahoma City with 27 points and Dennis Schroder added 24. Paul finished with 20 points and 10 assists. Oklahoma City used a 13-0 run late in the fourth quarter to flip a 99-92 deficit into a 105-99 lead with 25 seconds left and held on. Schroder drained a 3-pointer during the rally to tie the game at 99, and Paul hit the go-ahead jumper to make it 101-99. ""We just tried to finish, especially when we get to four- or five-minute mark,"" Paul said. ""That's winning time. That's when the really good teams lock in."" The Suns led 81-79 going into the fourth quarter after Jevon Carter hit a 3 in the final seconds of the third and pushed their lead to 99-92 with 4:30 remaining on Deandre Ayton's layup. But then they didn't score for more than four minutes, missing seven straight shots as the Thunder rallied. It was an entertaining game that featured 21 lead changes, which tied a season high for the Thunder. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker and Oubre, who both scored 27 points. Oubre made a 3 with 9.5 seconds left that pulled the Suns to 107-106, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hit two free throws on the ensuing possession to put the Thunder up three. ""We had our chances,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""We turned it over 22 times. They had 15 offensive rebounds. That is a lot of extra possessions to give a team that has as good of a guard trio as those guys."" Schroder sank a 3-pointer with eight seconds left in the second quarter to put the Thunder ahead 53-52 at halftime. Schroder and Gallinari had 12 points apiece in the first half, while Booker led the Suns with 14. REMEMBERING KOBE The Suns held 24 seconds of silence before the game to honor Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and the seven others who died in Sunday's helicopter crash. The public address announcer also read several of Bryant's on-the-court and off-the-court accomplishments, and the crowd chanted ""Kobe, Kobe"" for several seconds afterward. HEARING THE BOOS Paul was booed every time he touched the ball for most of the first half. The apparent reason? He made the Western Conference All-Star team when the reserves were announced Thursday and was likely one of the players who bumped Booker for one of the final spots. Paul got the last laugh with his clutch bucket that put the Thunder ahead late, and he hit multiple free throws in the final minute. TIP-INS Thunder: Starting center Steven Adams picked up three fouls in less than seven minutes in the first half. That squashed a potentially good start to the game after he had two quick baskets in the opening minutes. ... Starting guard Luguentz Dort played in college at Arizona State and this was his first game against the Suns. He had eight points. Suns: F Dario Saric sprained his left ankle in the first quarter and didn't return. He played just four minutes. ... Phoenix was playing without F Aron Baynes (left hip soreness), G/F Cameron Johnson (bruised right quad) and F Frank Kaminsky III (right patella stress fracture). Baynes has missed the past five games, Johnson the past six and Kaminsky the past 14.","401161367"
"Stephen A. Smith argues that LeBron James should be the highest-paid athlete in the world over Patrick Mahomes, because LeBron is more box office. (1:04) LOS ANGELES --  Kobe Bryant's resonant voice echoed through the darkened Staples Center while images from his life and career flickered on the scoreboard above. LeBron James' heartfelt pregame speech honoring his friend then left Lakers fans and players alike cheering through tears. The Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers somehow had to play a basketball game after a wrenching pregame ceremony honoring Bryant and the other eight victims of the helicopter crash just five days earlier. And Damian Lillard gave a performance that nudged aside the basketball world's collective heartbreak for just a moment. Lillard scored 48 points and the Trail Blazers beat Los Angeles 127-119 on Friday night in the Lakers' first game since Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others died in a helicopter crash. Lillard hit seven 3-pointers and added 10 assists and nine rebounds in an inspired effort that sent the Blazers to a win over an opponent still dealing with the trauma of the crash that claimed the life of their franchise icon. ""I think everybody was emotional tonight,"" said James, who played in two Olympics alongside Bryant. ""We all have our individual reasons why emotion hits us, and then we all have this brotherhood and this family, being a part of this Laker organization, which automatically brings in even more emotion."" Both teams stood on the court during a poignant pregame tribute to Bryant including songs, Kobe highlights and James' speech, which captivated the arena. ""So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out,"" James told the crowd. ""But in the words of us, `not forgotten.' Live on, brother."" Highlights of Bryant's career played during every break, but Lillard put on a show between the whistles. Lillard's seven 3-pointers gave him 40 in his last five games, setting an NBA record. But even the Blazers star knew results were secondary on this unique evening. ""I don't feel like anybody feels like we walked away as a winner tonight, given the circumstances,"" Lillard said. ""The memories that we'll take away from it was just sad and just tough. It's good that we had to compete, so being on the winning side is a positive, but I don't think anybody walks away from this moment and this situation a winner."" James had 22 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, and Anthony Davis had 37 points and 15 boards in the Lakers' first game since last Saturday. Hassan Whiteside scored 30 points, and C.J. McCollum added 19 for the Blazers, who were playing their third game since Bryant's death, which seems to have affected practically everyone who picked up a basketball in the past quarter-century. ""We've had five days and two games to kind of understand the emotions that were going to be out there,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""I know it was a tough game for the Lakers, watching them during the tribute, during LeBron's talk. I thought it was a difficult game for them to play. I mean, it was difficult for both teams, but I think we've had some time to go through the grieving process."" The entire evening was likely both profoundly painful and cathartic for anyone who loves the Lakers or Bryant, who won five championships while playing his entire 20-year NBA career in purple and gold. Bryant retired in 2016, but he remained a face of his only franchise and an inspiration to the current players, who learned about his death on their plane ride home from an East Coast road trip. Their next game against the Clippers was postponed, and the Lakers franchise persevered through a brutal week of coping with the loss. ""We understood this was going to be a difficult one,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We didn't want to lose, but this week has been more about life than basketball. ... We've got to continue to focus on the work. There's therapy in the work."" Several Lakers teared up during the ceremony, as did the Blazers -- but after both teams took 24-second and 8-second violations off the opening tip, they lifted the heavy moment with grace. Davis began the game with red eyes, but managed to score 18 points in the first quarter alone. The Lakers committed 13 turnovers in the first half while playing with an obvious surfeit of energy. Lillard, the gifted California native, went wild in the third quarter, scoring 23 points and hitting six 3-pointers in a virtuoso display of offensive skill. The Lakers then trailed by 12 in the fourth quarter before a ""Kobe! Kobe!"" chant broke out. They promptly made a 9-0 run, but the Blazers stayed steadily ahead. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Carmelo Anthony missed the game for what the Blazers called personal reasons. Anthony and Bryant were close friends. ... Lillard became the third player in league history with at least six 3-pointers in five straight games. Lakers: Quinn Cook, who idolized Bryant, was visibly affected by the ceremony. He checked into the game in the second quarter wearing his new No. 28 jersey, which represents Gianna (2) and Kobe (8). ... Alex Caruso played despite neck soreness. SOMBER MOMENTS The ceremony began in a darkened arena with Usher singing ""Amazing Grace."" Staples Center then showed a video of Bryant's highlights narrated by his own voice. James then took the microphone, discarded his prepared speech and commanded the crowd with stirring words from the heart. James joined the Lakers in 2018, and he spoke to Bryant several hours before the crash when Kobe congratulated LeBron on moving past him into third place on the NBA's career scoring list. Lakers public address announcer Lawrence Tanter then introduced each of the Lakers' five starters as Kobe Bryant, drawing tears and cheers from the sellout crowd. TOUGH TIMES The Lakers, the Clippers and the NHL's Kings all lost their emotionally charged first games at Staples Center after the death of Bryant, who played his final 17 seasons in the downtown arena.","401161368"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Clippers have their entire roster healthy for the first time this season and it showed against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Led by Kawhi Leonard's 31 points, the Clippers had five other players in double figures in a 118-106 victory Saturday. Leonard posted his ninth straight game with at least 30 points, the longest such streak in the NBA this season. ""He's playing as well as anyone in the league,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""It's not just his offense. He's doing it with his defense and his passing. It's coming in the flow. It's not forced. It doesn't stand out some nights. That's a great sign."" Karl-Anthony Towns countered with 32 points and 12 rebounds for the Timberwolves, his fourth consecutive game with 30 or more points, but it wasn't enough to keep Minnesota from losing its 11th in a row, matching the team's skid from December. ""Guys are hurt in there. We want to feel good, come out, and win these games,"" Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""We're going to keep getting after it, attack each day and have faith and confidence that the tide will turn."" Paul George added 21 points in 26 minutes and Lou Williams had 17 points for the Clippers, who have won seven of nine. ""I feel really good and my shoulders feel really good,"" said George, who got off to a slow start after having offseason shoulder surgery. ""I don't have any second thoughts of taking contact."" The Wolves closed within four points in the third on two free throws by Robert Covington after Towns scored five points in a row. The Clippers dominated the rest of the third thanks to a big effort by the reserves, including six points from Williams sandwiched between Leonard's dunk and a basket by George. They took a 98-86 lead into the fourth. The Clippers' bench outscored the Wolves' reserves, 46-33. ""With the depth they have on their team and what they're able to do, they can play a lot of different looks at you,"" Saunders said. George went down on a drive to the basket after getting poked in the eye by Covington in the third. He stayed in the game before briefly leaving the court. George scored the Clippers' first seven points of the fourth, extending their lead to 105-86, and then sat down for good. He was eventually joined on the bench by every starter. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Fell to 3-11 against the West. ... Allen Crabbe missed his second game in a row with a left knee subluxation. ... Host the Clippers next Saturday. Clippers: Leonard is two games from tying World B. Free's streak of 11 straight games with 30 or more points set from Jan. 2-23, 1980. Leonard's streak is the longest in his career. LEONARD'S JERSEY Leonard was headed to San Diego State after the game for a ceremony to retire his jersey at his alma mater. He planned to fly in a different plane than his Clippers teammates. Leonard used the same helicopter pilot that Kobe Bryant did in last weekend's fatal crash in heavy fog in Calabasas that killed all nine people aboard. ""A lot of my helicopter flights got cancelled"" when there was fog or other adverse conditions, Leonard said. He said he might have taken a helicopter to San Diego if he wasn't being accompanied by so many family members. ALL-STAR SNUB Towns, a two-time All-Star, wasn't selected for the festivities later this month in Chicago. He's only played in 31 of 48 games but came into Saturday averaging 26.9 points, 10.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists while shooting 51% from the floor. Towns said the game won't have the 24 best players in the league. ""I'm desensitized to being disrespected in this league,"" he said. ""I've been disrespected since I came in, so it's nothing new."" At the same time, Towns said, ""I'm on a journey that goes beyond All-Stars. It's not about the All-Star Games, it's about the NBA Finals, being in the playoffs, it's about winning games. That's how you build a legacy."" REMEMBERING KOBE Rivers and Saunders watched the Lakers' tribute to Bryant on TV Friday night. ""It was beautifully done,"" said Saunders, who expressed interest in visiting the impromptu memorial for Bryant and the other crash victims across from Staples Center. ""Being around it and being able to feel the emotion, you can feel what Kobe meant, not just to the game of basketball, but what he meant to a city and probably to people who didn't necessarily, might not have been basketball fans,"" Saunders said. He and his staff wore Bryant's shoes during the game. Rivers complimented the Lakers on the ceremony, saying, ""That was phenomenal.""","401161369"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Marcus Morris provided the boost down the stretch that New York needed to finish. Morris scored 12 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter, including 10 of the Knicks' final 12, in a 92-85 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. ""We stayed together throughout the entire game,"" Morris said. ""We defended really well and beat a good team. We stuck to the game plan. I think we all played well. It's just a good win for us. From start to finish we played really well."" Julius Randle had 16 points and a season-best 18 rebounds, and Taj Gibson added 10 points and seven rebounds to lead the Knicks (14-36). They snapped a two-game skid and won in the series after losing seven straight, including four losses on the road. New York last won at Indiana 109-103 on Jan. 23, 2017. Domantas Sabonis had 25 points and eight rebounds. Myles Turner had 12 points and six rebounds after missing the last two games with an illness, and Jeremy Lamb added nine points for the Pacers (31-18), who have lost two of three games. After Sabonis made a free throw to tie the game at 80 with 6:11 remaining, New York scored eight straight to go ahead 88-80 after Morris' jumper with 1:54 to go. The Pacers trailed for most of the game until Turner made a 3-pointer at the start of the fourth quarter to put Indiana ahead for the first time, 74-72. New York then scored three straight baskets to take the lead again. ""I thought we were flat the entire game,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""The first quarter we had some open looks that we didn't knock down. We just needed to challenge ourselves and get ourselves into the game defensively. It just seems like we were flat throughout this game. You're not going to beat teams scoring 11 points in the first."" The Knicks put together a 9-0 run in the first quarter and jumped out to a 23-11 lead by the end of the opening period. They went on a 9-2 run in the second to extend the early lead. Kevin Knox II made a layup at the end of a 7-0 run in the second quarter to put New York ahead 33-16 with 9:06 to play in the first half. ""I thought we did a good job starting out and setting the tone,"" Knicks interim coach Mike Miller said. ""We did a good job on their shooters. Great effort. We had contributions from so many different people.""

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Miami got 24 points from Jimmy Butler and a big boost from rookie Tyler Herro on Saturday night. But it was a big game from center Meyers Leonard that put the Heat over the top in a 102-89 victory over the Orlando Magic. ""Tonight it just happened to be a night where the ball was finding my energy on both ends of the floor, I guess,"" said Leonard, who had 18 points and 14 rebounds before going to the bench with five fouls with 5:49 left in the game. Herro came off the bench with six 3-pointers and 23 points. Herro and Leonard combined for 10-of-19 shooting from 3-point range to help the Heat beat Orlando for the second time this week and stretch their lead in the Southeast Division to 12 1/2 games. ""Everyone in the locker room wants Meyers to be more aggressive,"" said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. ""He really worked on it the last couple of days in practice, letting it fly, almost past his comfort zone. I'm talking about shooting it every time he touched it."" The 7-foot Leonard took 14 shots in 29 minutes. ""When he's making shots, you've got to step out to him,"" Butler said. ""Then he can put the ball on the floor and go around you and that gets everybody else involved. We've got so many guys who can do different things. You've got to pick your poison. Any given night it's going to be somebody."" Aaron Gordon scored 24 for the Magic, who lost their fifth straight. Nikola Vucevic added 21 points and nine rebounds. The Magic shot 39.8%. It was the fourth straight game in which they shot 40 percent or worse. ""Watching the last four games, we're getting good shots,"" said coach Steve Clifford. ""The big part of it is you've got to step up and make shots. To win and be good, what is more important than shot making?"" Miami led 57-49 at halftime despite a big first half by Gordon, who was 4 of 6 on 3s and scored 16 points. Herro, bumped out of the starting lineup by the return of fellow rookie Kendrick Nunn, hit three 3-pointers and scored 12 points in the first half. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Leonard stretched Miami's lead to double digits early in the second half, and the Heat led 73-60 when Butler converted a three-point play late in the third quarter.

"CLEVELAND --  The Golden State Warriors have the worst record in the NBA, but Steve Kerr hasn't lost his sense of humor. The Warriors coach grew accustomed to dealing with a media throng when Golden State played NBA Finals games in Cleveland every season from 2015-18. Kerr couldn't resist making a joke when he saw the number of reporters jammed into a small interview room Saturday night before a 131-112 victory over the Cavaliers. ""Still here?"" he said with a laugh. ""LeBron's not walking through that door. Kevin Durant's not walking through that door. Why is everybody here?"" Kerr had plenty to smile about during the game as the Warriors recorded their biggest margin of victory this season. Glenn Robinson III scored 22 points, Draymond Green tied a career high with 16 assists and the Warriors dominated the second half night in a matchup between teams at the bottom of the NBA standings. While the Warriors enjoyed a rare victory, Cavaliers coach John Beilein was clearly frustrated. Cleveland has lost 10 straight at home and 15 of 18 overall. Beilein said he asked a member of the team's media relations staff if he had to attend his customary postgame press conference. ""He said, yeah I do,"" Beilein said in comments that drew laughter from reporters. ""I asked him if I could plead the Fifth and how that no witnesses could be called to this game. That tells you a little bit how I feel."" Golden State (11-39) has the NBA's worst record while Cleveland (13-37) has the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference. The matchup bore little resemblance to when the teams met in the NBA Finals four straight years. The Warriors won three times while the Cavaliers broke the city's 52-year championship drought in 2016. Injuries to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are a major reason the Warriors have had such a difficult season. Golden State hit 18 3-pointers, including a team-record 10 in the third quarter when it took control. ""Who needs the Splash Brothers?"" Green said with a laugh. ""That's kind of a slap in the face (to them). That's nuts. There are a lot of numbers that don't make sense and that's one of them. I can have some fun with Steph about that."" The Warriors trailed 59-52 late in the second quarter, but went on a 53-19 run to take a 105-79 lead going into the fourth. Golden State scored 17 consecutive points -- its biggest run of the season -- to begin the game-changing spurt. The Warriors outscored Cleveland 44-19 in the third, causing Beilein to send his starters to the bench. Green played 26 minutes and scored eight points. The Warriors had seven players in double figures, including D'Angelo Russell with 19 and Damion Lee with 18. Collin Sexton scored 23 points while Kevin Love had 14 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland. Curry, who broke his hand in the fourth game of the season, could return in March.

THEY DON'T LIKE HIM HERE Green, who gets booed in every trip to town, heard it again throughout the game. ""To come back here and they still boo me, I love that,"" he said.

Beilein went up against Green several times while coaching at the University of Michigan. ""What power forward goes out and gets 16 assists like that, and that's what he does,"" Beilein said. ""I thought I had enough of him at Michigan State and he's still giving it to me now."" NUMBERS Golden State broke a five-game losing streak and a stretch of 10 in a row on the road. The Cavaliers haven't won at home since beating Atlanta on Dec. 23. The game had 11 lead changes and was tied seven times in the first half.

"WASHINGTON --  Kyrie Irving limped off the court after hurting his right knee, his latest injury coming just 24 hours after his best performance of the season. A night after scoring a season-high 54 points, Irving was forced to leave in the fourth quarter of the Brooklyn Nets' 113-107 loss to the Washington Wizards on Saturday. Irving, who missed nearly two months with a shoulder injury earlier in his first season with the Nets, has a history of injuries to his left knee. This mishap occurred with 5:31 remaining in the fourth quarter as he and Washington's Bradley Beal got tangled up on a held ball. Irving was on the floor for several minutes, holding his right knee. After coming to his feet and remaining on the court for a jump ball -- in which he didn't jump -- Irving left the floor with a sprained right knee and a season-low 11 points. He'll get an MRI on Sunday. X-rays were negative. ""I've done some pretty decent things to my knee in the past,"" Irving said. ""Just want to make sure my ACL, my MCL, and my PCL, just make sure that our medical staff did their check. The most important thing was just my ACL making sure it was fine. But it was just a weird, weird, weird, weird fall. Just felt a lot of stretching and tension afterwards and just a bad fall."" Irving said the injury was freakish. ""Brad's momentum just carried him underneath me,"" Irving said. Irving was just 5 for 12 from the field. ""We did a good job with our game plan of making Kyrie a little frustrated, blitzing him,"" Beal said. ""Kind of getting the ball out of his hands."" Irving missed Sunday's game against the Knicks after learning of Kobe Bryant's death. ""It's not irritating, man,"" Irving said. ""It's just been one hell of a week, that's all."" Beal led all scorers with 34 points. Thomas Bryant had 17 points and 10 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie, who scored 12 straight points for Brooklyn late in the third quarter and early in the fourth, led the Nets with 26 points. Joe Harris had 22 and Jarrett Allen had 13 points and 15 rebounds. Allen shook his head when he was asked about Irving's latest injury. At 21, he's in his third year with Brooklyn, but he's already seen a lot. ""If you look at the Nets history, it always happens like this,"" Allen said. ""Ever since I've been a Net we've always seen people go down."" It was the second straight victory for the Wizards, just their third winning streak of the season. Beal, who found out on Thursday that he wasn't selected for the All-Star Game, has scored at least 30 in six straight games. His free throw with 2:13 to play gave Washington a 107-106 lead. Nets: Are 2-5 on the second night of back-to-backs. ... Coach Kenny Atkinson says Irving reminds him of another player that's been in the news this week. ""Patrick Mahomes, I think he does similar things,"" Atkinson said. ""I'm no Andy Reid, that's for sure. I think you have to give great players freedom."" ... Garrett Temple scored 17 points, 14 in the first quarter. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks hopes that F Rui Hachimura, who hasn't played since Dec. 16 with a groin injury, is ready to return Monday. He was hoping for a return on Saturday. ""It's not a setback,"" Brooks said. ""It's a feel thing. He still has a little bit of rust that we want to take off his game."" ... C Moe Wagner (ankle) and G Jordan McRae (ankle) are nearing returns, too, according to Brooks. HOT BEAL Beal, who was miffed by his All-Star exclusion, contends that it's not an obsession. ""One thing I won't do is disrespect anybody who made it,"" Beal said. ""I'm past it ... It doesn't make me or break me. It doesn't define me as a player."" NOT-SO-HOT WIZARDS Despite losing six of 10, Washington is actually climbing in the standings. The Wizards recently passed both Charlotte and Detroit in the Eastern Conference and trail ninth-place Chicago by a half-game. They're 3 1/2 games behind Orlando for the eighth spot and four behind Brooklyn for seventh. ""We're chasing Milwaukee,"" Brooks joked about the team with the league's best record. ""We're not looking at that. We're not.""","401161373"
"BOSTON --  When he didn't make the All-Star Game, Jaylen Brown decided he'll use the break to rest up for what he hopes will be a long postseason run. ""Ain't no reason to cry over spilled milk,"" he said Saturday night after scoring 32 points in a 116-95 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. ""Playoffs is on my mind. That's the stage you want to be on. I think some people have got it backwards."" Brown added nine rebounds, and Jayson Tatum -- who was voted as a reserve in the All-Star Game in Chicago on Feb. 16 -- scored nine of his 25 points in a 99-second span that gave Boston the lead for good. Playing without injured point guard Kemba Walker, the Celtics won for the sixth time in seven games and avoided a season sweep by the 76ers. ""I haven't played as well against Philly as I would have liked the first three times,"" said Brown, who scored 20 points total in the three previous games against the 76ers this season. ""So tonight I wanted to make sure I left my imprint on the game."" In his fourth NBA season, Brown is averaging 20.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists -- all career highs. But he was left off the list of East All-Stars when the reserves were announced on Thursday. Walker was selected as a starter, and Tatum will come off the bench. ""It's more important to be playing like an All-Star than to be named one,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""And nobody exemplifies that better."" Ben Simmons scored 23 and ex-Celtic Al Horford had nine points and nine rebounds for the Sixers, who lost for the third time in five games. Joel Embiid scored 11, making just 1 of 11 shots and missing all four of the 3-pointers he attempted. ""He's not going to have that kind of night very often,"" Stevens said. ""He's an unreal player, and obviously we have the utmost respect for him. ... Probably more `one of those nights' for him than anything we did."" Philadelphia missed its first seven 3-point attempts and made just six of its first 24 shots overall. In all, the Sixers shot 36.9% from the field. ""They rolled out that athletic style, that physical style and Joel struggled tonight,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""Combined with shooting 7 for 33 from the 3-point line, it's going to make for a long night offensively."" It was 7-6 with 9 minutes left in the first quarter when the Celtics scored 10 straight points -- including nine in a row by Tatum. After Tobias Harris made a short jumper to halt the run, Tatum answered with a dunk over Horford that electrified the crowd. Tatum then stole the ball from Harris and fed Marcus Smart for a 3-pointer that gave Boston a 22-8 lead, its biggest of the quarter. The Sixers cut it to 59-51 at the half, but then came out cold and failed to make a basket in the first 5 1/2 minutes of the third quarter. The 12-1 Boston run made it 71-53 and Philadelphia never got closer than 13. TIP-INS Sixers: Simmons and Embiid are the first Philadelphia teammates to make the All-Star Game in consecutive seasons since Charles Barkley and Maurice Cheeks in 1987 and `88. ... On Feb. 1, 1992, the 76ers beat Boston 126-110 behind Barkley's 38 points and 11 rebounds. ... Philly fell 9-17 on the road. It is 22-2 at home. Celtics: Fans began shouting for 7-foot-5 rookie Tacko Fall starting in the third quarter. He entered to a standing ovation with 2:32 to play and made one basket. ... Gordon Hayward was 1 for 11 from the floor for Boston, and Brown was 1 for 10 from 3-point range. ... Brad Wanamaker scored a season-high 15 points. NO KEMBA Walker missed the game with left knee soreness, joining center Enes Kanter (bruised hip) in absentia. But the Celtics had Tatum back on unrestricted minutes; he missed three games with a sore right groin and then returned on Thursday night to play 24 minutes against Golden State. ""Kemba is a short-term thing. We hope to get him back in the very near future. And Kanter is short-term,"" Stevens said. ""We'll have time to be the best version of ourselves if we can get everyone back and healthy.""","401161374"
"DALLAS --  Dallas coach Rick Carlisle described the first game without top scores Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis as a great challenge. The rest of the Mavericks accepted that challenge. Jalen Brunson scored 27 points in his ninth start of the season, Dorian Finney-Smith matched a career high with 22 points and Maxi Kleber added 18 as Dallas beat the Atlanta Hawks 123-100 in a game between teams with depleted rosters. ""My mentality stayed the same (minus Doncic and Porzingis),"" said Brunson, in his second season. ""I just was seizing the opportunity a little more."" Doncic sprained his right ankle in Thursday's practice and isn't expected back until Feb. 10 at the earliest. Porzingis sat out the second of a back-to-back while recovering from a left knee injury. Carlisle said sitting Porzingis was decided before the Mavericks played on Friday night at Houston, where Porzingis scored a season-high 35 points in 36 minutes. Brunson scored 19 points in the first half, nearly surpassing his previous season high of 21. He scored 13 in the second quarter as the Mavericks took control. Seth Curry left in the fourth quarter with tightness in his left knee. Dallas had lost another starter, Dwight Powell, for the season on Jan. 21 with a torn right Achilles. ""We had a lot of good performances, really, top to bottom,"" said Carlisle, who recorded his franchise-best 500th Dallas win. ""It was a battle of attrition out there."" The Mavericks are 3-2 without Doncic, the second-year guard voted in as an All-Star starter. They built a 62-49 halftime lead and extended that advantage to 29 points in the third quarter. John Collins led the Hawks with 26 points and had 11 rebounds. Kevin Huerter scored 20 points. Trae Young, also a first-time All-Star starter in his second season, was limited to 12 points, more than 15 below his average. One game after having a career-high 18 assists, Young had one assist. He left the game late in the third quarter with a right ankle sprain. ""We'll talk more about it tomorrow,"" Young said of the injury, ""and hopefully I'll be better soon."" De'Andre Hunter, who has made 47 starts for Atlanta this season, didn't play because of a left ankle sprain. Cam Reddish left the game late in the first quarter with a face contusion and was placed in concussion protocol. Bruno Fernando missed his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. The Hawks raced to a 15-5 lead in the first four minutes with Huerter hitting all three of the team's 3-point shots. But the Mavericks answered with a 12-2 run to tie the score less than three minutes later. Dallas closed the period with a 19-9 spurt, beginning with a 16-foot pull-up jumper by Brunson with 5:33 left in the first quarter for the game's only lead change. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said he was disappointed his team didn't take advantage of a team that played the previous night on the road, losing 128-121 at Houston. ""They were spirited and moved the basketball well,"" Pierce said. TIP-INS Hawks: Huerter equaled a career best with six 3-pointers. . . Collins' midcourt heave to close the first half bounced straight up off the rim, off the top of the backboard and then swished through the net, though it didn't count. ... Vince Carter, who turned 42 on Jan. 26, was honored with a video tribute after the first quarter that recognized his three seasons with Dallas. Carter was cheered frequently during the game. Mavericks: Willie Cauley-Stein, acquired four days after Powell was lost, made his first start for the Mavericks. He had seven points and 10 rebounds in 26 minutes. ... Kleber matched a season high with four blocks. ... Dallas shot 20 of 39 from behind the arc for 51.3 percent and is 11-0 when shooting better than 50 percent from long range.","401161375"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs are hitting the road as inconsistent as ever. At least they're starting this nearly month-long trip on an upswing. DeMar DeRozan had 24 points and the Spurs overcame a 19-point deficit to beat the Charlotte Hornets 114-90 Saturday night in their final home game for 3 1/2 weeks. ""We competed in the second half,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We didn't compete in the first half."" The Spurs held the Hornets to 27 points in the second half and outscored them by 37. Miles Bridges had 25 points for Charlotte, which has lost 10 of 11. ""It's big, especially with that second half that we had,"" San Antonio center Jakob Poeltl said. ""It really got us going. I hope we can carry that over into our road trip. The spirits are high right now."" Poeltl added 17 points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes for the Spurs. San Antonio plays its next eight games on the road as the AT&amp;T Center hosts the city's annual Stock Show &amp; Rodeo. Its next home game is Feb. 26 against Dallas. The Spurs outscored the Hornets 50-15 during a stretch bridging the third and fourth quarters to win their second straight after losing three in a row. ""Every single guy was out there was trying to make a play, whatever it was,"" DeRozan said. ""Whether it was a steal, getting in the passing lane, blocked shot, rebound, anything."" San Antonio went on a 23-2 run in the third quarter, erasing a 19-point deficit with their defense. The Spurs had seven steals and the Hornets committed nine turnovers in the period. ""We knew Pop' was going to be on their tail at halftime,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""We talked about it at halftime, but for young guys, they just have to go through it. ""I can say it until I'm blue in the face in the locker room. `The pressure is going to pick up. They're going to get into you. They're going to try to turn you over.' It's just one of those things we have to go through."" Poeltl ran down an errant pass intended for Willy Hernangomez at midcourt and Eurostepped in the lane for a layup between two defenders to cut the lead to 72-68. Patty Mills had a steal on the Hornets' next possession and tossed the ball upcourt to Derrick White, who completed a three-point play. DeRozan put the Spurs up 74-72, their first lead since the opening minutes of the second quarter. ""We did a great job of moving the ball in the first half, but in the second half we didn't move the ball that much,"" Bridges said. ""That was the difference."" Charlotte had 22 points in the paint during the second quarter in grabbing a 63-50 lead. Cody Zeller had two dunks and Devonte' Graham threw down an alley-oop, drawing gasps from the crowd. Zeller finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Graham had eight points. TIP-INS Hornets: Borrego received a warm reception when introduced prior to the game. Borrego was a Spurs assistant coach from 2003-2010 and 2015-2018. Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge had eight points and seven rebounds in his return from a two-game absence due to a sprained right thumb. ... Poeltl has 75 blocks in 48 games this season, second only to the 100 he had in 82 games with Toronto in 2018. ONE OF A KIND Borrego did not foresee Tim Duncan becoming an assistant coach once his playing career was over but said the pairing makes sense given Duncan's selflessness. Borrego was an assistant for 10 seasons under Gregg Popovich. Duncan joined Popovich's staff this season as an assistant coach after retiring in 2016 as the franchise's leader in numerous categories. ""I have never seen anything like him,"" Borrego said. ""The humility, the transparency. Every loss he took on his shoulders, every win he praised the people around him. That's rare in today's NBA or in sports culture."" EUROPEAN EUROSTEP The Spurs were still buzzing about Poeltl's Eurostep after the game. ""I didn't even think about it,"" Poeltl said, chucking throughout his answer. ""It just came to me. I saw a lot of open court in front of me, so I went for it.""","401161376"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard says the secret to his hot streak is sticking to what works. Lillard had 51 points, including nine 3-pointers, and 12 assists as the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Utah Jazz their season-high fourth straight loss with a 124-107 victory Saturday night. It was Lillard's NBA-record sixth straight game with at least six 3-pointers. I'm just sticking to my routine,"" he said. ""I don't think people understand how easy it is -- once the season gets going and you start wearing down and getting tired, traveling, personal stuff you've got to deal with, it's easy to get sidetracked from your routine."" For Lillard, that means a nightly 25-minute shooting workout, making 100 free throws, 15 minutes of ball-handling drills. Cold tubs in the morning. Eating and sleeping right. Clearly, it's working. Lillard has scored 40 or more points in five of his last six games, averaging 48.8 points over the span. It was his fourth straight double-double, a career best. He's had three 50-plus games in his last six. When Lillard went to the line to shoot a free throw that gave him 50 points, the crowd at Moda Center chanted ""MVP! MVP!"" He then sank his second free throw before heading to the bench with 2:15 left. Hassan Whiteside added 17 points and 21 rebounds for the Blazers, who won their fourth straight to match their season high. Donovan Mitchell had 25 led the Jazz with 25 points. No need to panic but we've got to figure it out, Mitchell said. We've got to have a good practice to get it back. It's a complete 180 to where we were about a week ago so we've got to lock in and fix it, otherwise it's going to be a (bad) All-Star break. Portland was coming off an emotional 127-119 victory at the Los Angeles Lakers the night before. It was the Lakers' first game at home following the death of Kobe Bryant last Sunday. Lillard had 48 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds against the Lakers, becoming the first league player since the 1983-84 season with at least 35 points, five rebounds and five assists in five straight games. He had 40 3-pointers over that span, also a first in the league. Lillard is the reigning Western Conference player of the week after averaging 52.7 points last week, including a franchise-record 61 points on Jan. 20 against the Golden State Warriors. He's in the MVP conversation in my opinion, Mitchell said. He understood where the team was in the playoff situation obviously with guys hurt, and he's taken it upon himself to go out there and do it. He's on a hell of a run. As are the Blazers, who have won seven of 10. I think it's just coming together. I think that's the best way to describe it, Lillard said. We're getting healthier, we're starting to figure out what works for us. Carmelo Anthony returned to the starting lineup for the Trail Blazers after missing Friday night's game in Los Angeles. Anthony was a close friend of Bryant's. Mike Conley made his first start for the Jazz since Dec. 17. Conley has been coming off the bench as he returned from a nagging hamstring injury. Conley got off to a fast start. His 3-pointer gave the Jazz a 32-21 lead and he finished the first quarter with 11 points. But Portland closed the gap to 34-33 going into the second quarter after Nassir Little's dunk. Back-to-back baskets from Trevor Ariza gave the Blazers a 45-42 lead midway through the period. Lillard's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 63-53 lead at the half. Lillard led all scorers at the break with 23 points. Utah closed to with 68-65 but Lillard's consecutive baskets held the Jazz off. Little's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 91-73 lead before the third quarter was over. Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic each finished with 22 points for the Jazz. TIP INS Jazz: Utah was held to just 19 points in the second quarter. ... The Jazz are one of just two teams to allow an opposing player 50-plus points three times this season. Trail Blazers: Coach Terry Stotts said before the game that big man Jusuf Nurkic, who is working his way back from a broken leg, sat out of practice last week with a right calf strain. ... Lillard has eight straight games with 30-plus points. NO MORE WORDS Stotts has said all he possibly can about Lillard at this point. Don't ask me about Dame. I'm all out of superlatives. Don't ask me to explain it. Don't ask me what I think. Write what you want, because it's fun to watch and he's playing exceptional basketball, Stotts said.","401161377"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Lakers say they are fully prepared for the steady stream of tributes for Kobe Bryant that they will surely see the rest of the season. LeBron James welcomes it, calling it a therapeutic and needed part of the Lakers' healing process. James had another triple-double despite an off-night shooting, Anthony Davis scored 21 points and Los Angeles thumped the Sacramento Kings 129-113 on Saturday, its first win since Bryant's death. ""It's never going to feel normal. It's never going to feel the same,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""But we got our first win since this happened. There's going to be a lot of important steps for us along the way and this was definitely one."" James had 15 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds while helping Los Angeles end a two-game skid. James shot 6 of 15 and missed three of four 3-pointers but made up for it with his 11th triple-double of the season and the 92nd of his career. The Lakers were playing the second half of a back-to-back, one night after an emotional 127-119 loss to Portland at Staples Center in their first game since Sunday's helicopter crash that killed Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others. During the first timeout less than four minutes into the game, a video of both Bryant and Gianna playing basketball was shown on the giant scoreboard as members of both the Lakers and Kings watched. The numbers 8 and 24 flashed on the court as Bryant's voice echoed through the building. Tributes continued to play throughout the game as fans -- many wearing Bryant's jerseys -- repeatedly chanted his name. ""We're prepared for it. We understand it and we hope it happens every night just because of the legacy that he's left behind,"" James said. ""We're prepared for it as a team, as an organization and we're going to continue to get through it. It's our obligation just to go out and play the game, have that winning mentality because that's what he would want."" A memorial wall with pictures of Bryant and Gianna was set up outside one of the main entrances to Golden 1 Center. Fans scrawled messages on the wall and left flowers. Inside, the Lakers did their best to move forward following the tragedy that left the entire organization reeling. They scored 44 points in the first quarter, made 14 3s and dished out 26 assists before halftime, dominating the Kings on both ends while building an 81-64 lead. Avery Bradley added 19 points, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 15 and Rajon Rondo had 13 points and eight assists for Los Angeles. James capped a fast break with a two-handed dunk in the second quarter that drew roars from the crowd, then made a long bounce pass to Caldwell-Pope for a layup. James followed that with another dunk, and Rondo added a 3-pointer. ""Tonight, it was get back on track,"" Vogel said. ""Let's get back to business and go out and get a win, no matter what."" De'Aaron Fox scored 24 points and Buddy Hield had 22 for Sacramento. ""That was a really good team that was unfortunately . they were locked in,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""Give them credit, they came out firing."" The Kings got within 108-93 early in the fourth quarter before the Lakers pulled away. James had a 3-pointer, Rondo scored twice and Caldwell-Pope made three free throws. ""We wanted to put together a complete game and we did that tonight,"" James said. TIP-INS Lakers: Los Angeles finished with 33 assists. . The 81 points in the first half were a season high. That also matched Bryant's career high for scoring. . Bradley had 16 points with four 3s in the first half. . Kyle Kuzma scored 12 points. Kings: Eric Mika had six points and seven rebounds in his NBA debut. Mika, who had been with Stockton of the G League, was signed to a 10-day contract earlier in the day. RECORD ROAD STREAK The Lakers have won 15 consecutive games in Western Conference road arenas, the longest such streak in NBA history according to the team's website. ""I know we've had success on the road but you do something that's never been done before in this league, that's pretty special,"" Vogel said.","401161378"
"DETROIT --  It took Detroit just over half a quarter to fall behind by 21. Then the Pistons rallied almost as quickly. ""We came out as flat as a pancake,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""But the second group came in and played."" Bruce Brown had 19 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, and fellow reserve guard Reggie Jackson scored 20 points to lift the Pistons to a 128-123 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. Andre Drummond added 21 points and 17 rebounds for Detroit, which snapped a five-game losing streak. It was the 400th career double-double for the 26-year-old Drummond. Only Dwight Howard, who was 25, has reached that milestone at a younger age. Nikola Jokic had 39 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for Denver. It was an impressive day for Detroit's younger players. Brown, who is in his second NBA season, played the most of anyone on the Pistons. Rookie Sekou Doumbouya scored all 17 of his points in the first half to help Detroit dig out of its early hole. Drummond put the Pistons ahead to stay with a dunk early in overtime, and Brown added a 3-pointer that made it 116-112. Drummond fouled out with 2:43 left, but Detroit was able to hold on. Jokic made a 3-pointer with 29.4 seconds left that made it 126-123, but Thon Maker answered with an alley-oop dunk from Tony Snell at the other end to push the lead to five with 16.5 seconds left. ""When that last lob went up to Thon, I did hold my breath,"" Casey said. ""Time, score, situation -- but he made it, so it worked out."" The Nuggets were playing for the third time in four days, and the 12:30 p.m. start time -- 10:30 a.m. back in Denver -- made for another potential challenge. The Nuggets looked just fine at the outset, making 16 of their first 20 shots from the field. They led 28-7 and 31-10, but that three-touchdown lead on Super Bowl Sunday didn't last. ""I was so impressed with the start of the game on both ends of the floor,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""We went to our bench and right when we went to our bench, it was like the bottom fell out."" Denver led 44-30 at the end of the first quarter. Detroit rallied in the second, tying the game with a 21-8 run and eventually taking a 68-65 lead into halftime. It was tight down the stretch. Jackson missed a runner in the final seconds of regulation with the score tied at 111. Rookie forward Michael Porter Jr. joined the list of injured Denver players, missing the game because of a right ankle problem. The Nuggets are also without Paul Millsap (left knee), Jamal Murray (left ankle) and Mason Plumlee (right foot). SNAPPED Derrick Rose's steak of 14 straight games with at least 20 points ended when the Detroit guard exited with a left groin issue. Rose finished with two points in 12:52. ""Next man up,"" Brown said. ""Everybody has to be ready to play."" DEPTH Detroit's reserves outscored Denver's 62-26. Malik Beasley (12 points) was the only backup for the Nuggets who scored in double figures. ""I just apologized to (starting forward) Jerami Grant,"" Malone said. ""I played him 45 minutes tonight. That's insane. But guys have to be ready to play and help us and defend, and you can't come in the game and allow three straight blow-bys for layups."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver had its highest-scoring first quarter of the season, and the 44 points equaled the team's highest total in any quarter. ... It was the 10th triple-double of the season for Jokic and the 38th of his career. Pistons: Luke Kennard (knee) missed the game. ... Snell surpassed 600 3-pointers for his career.","401161379"

(1:24) HOUSTON -- Houston coach Mike D'Antoni has been around James Harden long enough to know that he'd eventually snap out of his shooting slump. But he admitted on Sunday that he was quite relieved to see it happen sooner rather than later. I can go home and go to bed now,"" D'Antoni said. Before I wouldn't be sleeping much."" Harden had 40 points and came an assist shy of a triple-double to lead the Rockets to a 117-109 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Rookie sensation Zion Williamson had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, whose three-game winning streak was snapped. Harden, who added 10 rebounds and nine assists, poured in 26 points in the first half and cooled down in the second half. But he still had his second straight game with 30 or more points after failing to score 30 in his previous four games as he worked through a shooting slump. James is James, so we can put all that other stuff the rest because he seems like he's back,"" D'Antoni said. Jrue Holiday had three points before Josh Hart made one of two free throws to allow New Orleans to cut the lead to 110-107 with about two minutes to go. Eric Gordon added a basket seconds after that and Danuel House hit a 3-pointer to make it 115-107 with less than a minute left to seal the victory. Brandon Ingram had 28 points and 12 rebounds for New Orleans. Houston went with its small lineup again as center Clint Capela missed his second straight game and the third in four games with a bruised right heel. Russell Westbrook added 22 points for the Rockets and Ben McLemore had 22 off the bench. Harden was more interested in talking about Houston's defense down the stretch than his shooting. We did a pretty good and solid job the entire game,"" he said. The fourth quarter was the time to lock it down and we did that to win the game."" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry was unhappy that his team didn't get the ball to Williamson for long stretches in the fourth quarter. Zion can't go four minutes without touching the basketball and that's on me,"" he said. That's something that I've got to make sure that that will never happen again. Gentry was asked if the failure to get the ball to him was a product of the team not being used to playing with the rookie who has only played six games. No,"" he said. You've got to get him the damn basketball ... if not there's no reason for us to have him in the game. And that's not going to happen either."" Williamson wasn't upset about his lack of touches in the fourth quarter. I trust my teammates,"" he said. They felt like what they did was the right play and I don't fault them with anything they did."" The Pelicans led by one to start the fourth and scored the first four points of the quarter to make it 97-92. But Harden made a 3-pointer before finding Westbrook for a layup to tie it up with about 10 minutes left. The Pelicans were up by two points later in the fourth when House made a 3-pointer to put Houston up 102-101. Both teams missed numerous shots after that and Houston finally got back on the board with a layup by House with about seven minutes to go. Harden made a layup after that to push Houstons lead to 106-101. Hart made the first field goal for New Orleans in more four minutes after that to cut the lead to 106-103 midway through the fourth. The teams combined to miss nine shots over the next 2  minutes before Harden added two points on free throws that pushed Houstons run to 9-2 and made it 108-103 with 3  minutes to go. This game was close throughout and Houston cut the lead to 93-92 entering the fourth quarter after McLemore made two of three free throws after he was fouled on a 3-pointer. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans made 10 of 33 3-pointers. ... Hart had 16 points and 10 rebounds. ... The Pelicans scored just 16 points in the fourth quarter. ... Lonzo Ball scored 10 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists. Rockets: Coach Mike DAntoni said Capela is day to day with his injury and that he wont play until he is pain free. ... Houston made 16 of 51 3-point attempts. ... House had 12 points and 12 rebounds. ZION'S START Sunday was the fourth 20-point game for Williamson. He's the first rookie to score 20 or more points four times in his first six games since Damian Lillard did it in the 2012-13 season. Before Lillard, the last one to do it was Kevin Durant in 2007-08.","401161380"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks have lost 28 games since the start of last season. Only once did they follow one defeat with another. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 19 rebounds, and the Bucks rebounded yet again by beating the Phoenix Suns 129-108 Sunday -- two days after a loss to Denver. ""A good response,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Not our best, but a steady, good response. Antetokounmpo reached the 30-point mark for the 26th time, and fellow All-Star Khris Middleton had 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Brook Lopez added 17 points, and the Bucks shot 49.5% and made 15 of 38 from 3-point range. Devin Booker scored 32 points and spurred a third-quarter surge by Phoenix, and the deficit dropped to nine when DeAndre Ayton dropped a hook shot with 3:51 left in the quarter. Milwaukee responded with three straight 3-pointers -- including back-to-back from Donte DiVincenzo -- to snuff out the rally. ""It was a game until they hit those three 3s in a row,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. ""I'm proud of the way the guys competed."" Ayton had 20 points and 14 rebounds, and the Suns shot 39% and made just 6 of 23 from deep. TIP-INS Suns: G Ricky Rubio (right ankle), G Ty Jerome (left calf) and PF Dario Saric (ankle) sat out, leaving Williams with just 11 players. ... SF Elie Okobo made his third start of the season in place of Rubio, and PF Tariq Owens, PG Jalen Lecque and PG Jared Harper were recalled from Northern Arizona of the G-League. Frank Kaminsky and Aron Baynes also sat out. Baynes was active but remained on the sideline with a hip injury. Bucks: DiVincenzo scored 15 points after missing Milwaukee's game Friday against Denver with a sprained left ankle. ... The Bucks are still without George Hill, who also missed Friday's game with a strained right hamstring. ... The Bucks' magic number to clinch a playoff spot is now 8. ... Milwaukee scored at least 100 points for a 73rd consecutive game. SIZE MATTERS Lopez took advantage of the undermanned and undersized Suns by blocking a career-high nine shots -- one off the Bucks' franchise record. ""It was a team effort,"" Lopez said. ""Phoenix got some easy (shots) in the beginning of the game. We came out a little loose (defensively) but we definitely tightened up and it shows."" WELCOME TO THE SHOW Barely 24 hours after scoring six points for G League Northern Arizona, Tariq Owens found himself up against Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, who barreled past him for an easy transition basket. I was just trying to get a stop, Owens said. ""He's one of those players I like watch film on so to be in the game and Giannis is the first person I have to guard is kind of a dream come true."" Owens scored 2 points on 1-of-4 shooting and grabbed two offensive rebounds in his first seven minutes. GOOD IMPRESSION Booker told Owens and Jaylen Lecque, a 19-year-old who was making a name for himself with highlight-reel dunks in the G League, to relax and trust their teammates as they got their first taste of NBA action. ""Just play hard. Leave a mark, don't be hesitant,"" Booker said. ""We""ll take care of you guys out there, just come ready to play. ""Getting called up from the G League and playing Milwaukee is a tough task but they showed a lot heart.""","401161381"
"TORONTO --  Terence Davis hasnt forgotten about being passed over for a spot in the Rising Stars Challenge at All-Star weekend. Even so, the Toronto Raptors rookie is just happy hes playing for a contender. Davis came off the bench to score a career-high 31 points and the Raptors tied a team record with their 11th straight win, beating the Chicago Bulls 129-102. Toronto also won 11 straight in January 2016 and again from Feb. 26-March 16, 2018. Pascal Siakam added 17 points, Serge Ibaka had 16, Chris Boucher 15 and Kyle Lowry 14 for the reigning NBA champions. The Raptors outscored the Bulls 69-39 in the second half to win their 12th consecutive meeting with Chicago. Davis made a career-high 12 of his 15 field goal attempts, including six of seven from 3-point range. The ball was going in, so I kept shooting, Davis said. Davis is the sixth rookie in Raptors history to score at least 30 in a game, and the first to do it as a reserve. Hes reaping some of the benefits of all his hard work,"" coach Nick Nurse said. Davis said the All-Star snub was definitely in the back of my mind, but insisted hes content with the Raptors, who are second in the East. Im not saying I wouldnt want to play in the game, because its a special event, but I would rather play in the playoffs, Davis said. An undrafted rookie from the University of Mississippi, Davis had scored 23 points twice this season, most recently against Washington on Jan. 17. He surpassed that mark with a 13-point fourth quarter, and received a hug from Lowry when he checked out with 3:12 remaining. It just shows you what type of team this is, Davis said. We all love each other, we care for each other, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, honestly. Thaddeus Young fouled out with 21 points and Zach LaVine had 18 as Toronto swept Chicago for the third straight season. Chandler Hutchison scored 17 points, and Ryan Arcidiacono and Coby White each had 12 for the Bulls, who are 8-18 on the road. The Raptors were without guard Norman Powell, who broke the ring finger on his left hand in Fridays win at Detroit. Center March Gasol missed his third straight game because of a sore left hamstring. Both players are out indefinitely. With Norm being out, (Davis) is going to have an opportunity, Lowry said. Hes got to take advantage of it. Bulls guard Kris Dunn missed his first game of the season, with Hutchison starting in his place. Coach Jim Boylen said Dunn has been diagnosed with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Dunn was injured on the first possession of Fridays loss at Brooklyn. He flew back to Chicago Saturday to be evaluated by team doctors. Bulls forward Daniel Gafford didnt return after suffering an apparent injury on an awkward fall in the first quarter, but Boylen said afterward that Gafford was OK. Gafford had missed the previous nine games because of a dislocated right thumb. Chicago led 63-60 at halftime, but Toronto reclaimed the lead with a 17-4 run over the first five minutes of the third. We dropped our heads a little bit in that third when the ball wasnt going in and they made their run, Boylen said. Siakam scored nine points in the third and Ibaka had eight as the Raptors took a 95-85 lead to the fourth. We threw it away, a disappointed LaVine said. Same story we do most of the games we lead at halftime. TIP-INS Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen (stress reaction, right pelvis) missed his sixth straight game. Raptors: Toronto has won four straight at home.  F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (right ankle) missed his fourth straight game. Nurse said Hollis-Jefferson could return Wednesday against the Pacers.  G-F Malcolm Miller (neck) did not play.  The Raptors outscored the Bulls 66-30 in bench points. KNOCKING ON THE PLAYOFF DOOR Chicago is ninth in the East, three and a half games behind Orlando for the final playoff berth. The Bulls have lost three straight after winning four of the previous six. When opportunity knocks, youve got to open the door, LaVine said. We just stood there. We might have jiggled the handle a little bit, but thats about it. MAGIC NUMBER Toronto is 13-0 this season when shooting 50 percent or better. SUPER SUNDAY The Raptors won on Super Bowl Sunday for the fourth straight season.","401161382"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  All the Orlando Magic needed to get back on track was a return trip to Charlotte. Nikola Vucevic scored 22 points, Aaron Gordon had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and the Magic snapped a five-game skid with a 112-100 win over the Hornets on Monday night. Evan Fournier added 17 points and Markelle Fultz had 12 points and 14 assists for the Magic, who won for the first time since beating the Hornets by 23 points here on Jan. 20. ""We always preach don't ever get too high, never get too low in this league -- and this was just one of those games that we needed,"" Gordon said. Terry Rozier scored 18 points to lead the struggling Hornets, who have lost 11 of 12. Orlando (22-28) led by eight entering the fourth quarter but quickly stretched the lead to 16 behind back-to-back 3-pointers from Terrence Ross and Gary Clark. The Hornets cut the lead to seven, but Ross hit two more 3s on consecutive possessions to push the lead back to 13. Ross finished with 13 points on four 3s. Orlando shot 16 of 34 from 3-point range; the Hornets were 9 of 31. ""We lost at the 3-point line by 21 points and that was the difference,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""We won the paint game and that was encouraging. ... But unfortunately they made seven more 3s than us, which isn't typical for them. They're not typically a big-time 3-point shooting team but they made shots that you have to give them credit for."" The Magic move the ball well too, finishing with 35 assists. Magic coach Steve Clifford called the ball movement a ""step forward."" ""I mean it's how we have to play,"" Clifford said. ""It's how we're built. We play traditional NBA basketball, but the ball has got to move. Everybody has to share it equally and when we do, that's when we played our best last year."" Devonte Graham scored 15 points for the Hornets (16-34) after being held to just two points in the first three quarters. Graham came into the game struggling from the field, making 8 of 23 shots from the floor over his previous three games. He finished 6 of 13 against Orlando. TIP INS Magic: Khem Burch sat out after experiencing lower back soreness before the game. ... Orlando was out-rebounded 46-37. Hornets: Rookie P.J. Washington missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle. FULTZ STEPS UP Fultz's 14 assists were a season high. ""He's got great shooters around him,"" Fournier said with a laugh. Fournier called Fultz a ""special talent,"" adding that ""he's a point guard, he's athletic and he's big. He's able to get into small spaces and just find guys around him and we're all aware of that. He's a good passer, so we're always ready for him."" MARTIN GIVES A SPARK Charlotte's Cody Martin gave his team a needed spark off the bench, scoring a career-high 13 points on 6-of-6 shooting. ""For me it is about confidence, and the more I play the more confidence I have,"" Martin said. MO BAMBA The Magic got 12 points, seven rebounds and two blocked shots from Mo Bamba in less than 12 minutes of playing time. ""It changes everything,"" Fournier said. ""To be a good team, you need balance and to have balance, you have to have a good bench and they definitely did a good job -- even Gary (Clark) who's new. He was locked in today. He had a big shot, so everyone contributed.""","401161383"
"CLEVELAND --  Kevin Love doesn't know what the future holds. All he can do is make the most of the present. Right now, that's not easy in Cleveland. Love scored a season-high 33 points in possibly his final home game with the Cavaliers, but Marcus Morris Sr. led the New York Knicks to a 139-134 overtime victory Monday night. Morris' basket from the left wing gave New York a 135-134 lead with a minute to play. He added another jumper and two free throws on his way to 26 points. The Cavaliers lost for the 11th time in 12 games. They have dropped 11 straight at home. Love, the subject of trade rumors ahead of Thursday's deadline, was 12 of 20 from the field. He also grabbed 13 rebounds. ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" Love said. ""We'll let the chips fall. I've been saying that, but I expect to probably finish the season out here and continue to play extremely hard."" Love hit a jumper to put Cleveland ahead 134-133 with 1:19 left. Morris missed the morning shoot-around because of an illness. He was 8 of 15 from the field and made all eight of his free throws. ""I've still got a little stomach virus there, but I'm good,"" Morris said. New York's Elfrid Payton, returning from a one-game suspension, had 17 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds for his first triple-double of the season. Cleveland led 118-108 with five minutes to play in regulation, but New York rallied behind Morris, who scored 10 points in the quarter to push the Knicks ahead. ""We took it kind of bitter,"" Morris said of the deficit. ""I told the guys, 'Step up right now, the game is not over.' I got into positions, they got the ball where I needed it, and I just made it happen."" Julius Randle's layup gave New York a 127-124 lead before Collin Sexton's 3-pointer tied the game with 13 seconds left. Morris missed a jumper, but the Knicks got the rebound and called timeout. Morris' jumper from the left corner rimmed out at the buzzer Sexton had 29 points for Cleveland, going 11 of 22 from the field. The Cavaliers (13-38) are tied with Atlanta for the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland center Tristan Thompson, also the subject of trade rumors, was sidelined by a sore right quad. He worked out on the court before the game and the team announced he was out 45 minutes prior to tip-off. Coach John Beilein said Thompson got treatment after the shoot-around, but the leg was still bothering him before the game. TIP-INS Knicks: Randle (sore quad) was listed as probable, but he scored 20 points. ... Dennis Smith scored 15. ... G Frank Ntilikina (groin) returned after missing two games. He was hurt Jan. 28 at Charlotte. Cavaliers: Thompson watched the second half from the bench. ... Larry Nance Jr. started at center and scored 18 points. He was hit with a technical for giving a sarcastic thumbs up to an official after not getting a call as the first half ended. ... F Alfonso McKinnie's second 10-day contract expired and he's now a free agent. A LOOK BACK The Cavaliers acquired Love from Minnesota in 2014. He was a key part of a team that won the championship in 2016 and made the Finals every year from 2015-18. ""When my time's done here I'll reflect on how amazing it is and was,"" he said. ""I've known so many great people here and had so many great moments."" SHOWING IMPROVEMENT The Knicks have won three of five, including two straight on the road. New York won at Indiana on Saturday. ""The way Marcus closed the game was great,"" coach Mike Miller said. ""We did a good job getting him shots where he needed it.""","401161384"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  With All-Star starter Luka Doncic sidelined by a sprained right ankle for the third consecutive game, Kristaps Porzingis provided the offensive firepower for Dallas. The 7-foot-3 Porzingis scored a season-high 38 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the Mavericks to a 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night. ""That's something in the future I want to figure out, how I can be effective also when Luka is playing,"" Porzingis said. ""It's something we've been working on. I'm in a good rhythm now and I want to keep it going. I think we're playing pretty good basketball, we're moving the ball, playing aggressive."" Porzingis shot 6 of 13 on 3-pointers and made all 12 of his free throws. The six 3-pointers tied a career high. It wasn't a perfect night for Porzingis, though. He wasn't pleased with his defense on Domantas Sabonis, who scored 26 points on 9-of-12 shooting. ""I take a lot of pride in my defense and I feel like Sabonis made some good moves on me,"" Porzingis said. ""He got deep in the paint. I was a half-step late on a lot of those shots. I'm disappointed in that sense, but I'm glad we got the win."" Tim Hardaway Jr. contributed 25 points for Dallas. Sabonis fell just short of a triple-double, finishing with 12 rebounds and nine assists. Malcolm Brogdon added 14 points for the Pacers. Victor Oladipo hit a 3-pointer for Indiana with five seconds left in the third quarter to close the deficit to 82-77. The Pacers cut the margin to 96-93 on a three-point play by Sabonis with 5:09 left, but the Mavericks were able to maintain control. Porzingis sank two free throws with 32 seconds remaining to make it 110-103. ""When we were able to get back into the game, we would have a breakdown on the perimeter and they would get to the basket or get to the free throw line,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""They made big shots to stop our runs."" After missing the first 47 games of the season while rehabbing a ruptured quadriceps tendon in his right knee, Oladipo has struggled with his shooting since returning last week. He was 4 of 17 from the field against the Mavericks, including 1 for 10 from 3-point range, after going 4 of 22 overall and 2 for 11 on 3s in the previous two games. Oladiapo had been sidelined since getting injured on Jan. 23, 2019. ""I feel like I'm taking great shots,"" Oladipo said. ""I just can't think about it. Just got to keep shooting. I've missed, obviously, a lot of basketball and maybe the rhythm might be off a little bit coming in and out as far as the minutes restriction."" The Pacers shot 52% in taking a 55-53 lead at halftime. Dallas shot 42.9% but nearly made up the difference by going 9 for 20 on 3s while Indiana was 4 of 18. For the game, the Mavericks shot 41.9% from the floor and 40% on 3s. The Pacers shot 46% and 21% on 3s. The Mavericks held a 51-40 rebounding edge, including 30-20 in the second half. Dallas hit 22 of 23 free throws. The Pacers were 8 of 11. DIFFERENT STYLE With Doncic out, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said the team's style changes. Doncic, averaging 28.8 points per game, previously missed four games with a right ankle sprain earlier this season. ""We just go to a more free-flowing style. We call less plays,"" Carlisle said. ""We've done this enough now where guys are really getting a feel for how to play with each other when Luka's out. We need him back, but these guys are doing a great job."" TIP-INS Mavericks: J.J. Barea sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return. He had three points in nine minutes. Pacers: T.J.

"Scottie Pippen doesn't foresee D'Angelo Russell fitting in with the Splash Brothers when they return, which is why the Warriors should make a move to trade Russell. (0:37) WASHINGTON --  Draymond Green thinks the Golden State Warriors are making progress during their challenging season. Green had 12 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, helping Golden State beat Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards 125-117 on Monday night. It was the second straight win for the NBA-worst Warriors (12-39), with both coming on the road. They lost 15 of their previous 17. Golden State is playing without Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson due to long-term injuries. But Green said the victory at Washington was a positive sign. The Warriors led by as many as 19 points midway in the third quarter, but the Wizards cut it to 115-110 with 3:39 remaining. ""That's definitely a step in the right direction,"" Green said. ""A month or ago, we would have lost that game when they cut it to five."" Golden State shot 50% (15 for 30) from 3-point range and had six players score in double figures. Alec Burks had 30 points, Glenn Robinson III added 22 and Damion Lee finished with 19. ""We are not turning it over and playing with really good pace,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""I think Draymond sets a good tone for us when he pushes the ball. Made or miss, when we get into our offense quickly, that's a big help."" Beal led Washington with 43 points in his seventh straight game with at least 30 points, the third-longest such streak in team history. Davis Bertans had 19 points. Golden State grabbed control with a 15-0 run spanning halftime that made it 79-63 with 9:56 to play in the third quarter. ""We did not come out to play with the right mindset,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""I don't know what we were thinking, but we weren't thinking the right things."" Beal went 15 for 30 from the field while passing the injured John Wall for third on Washington's career scoring list. Beal also went 10 for 10 at the line in his fifth straight game with at least 10 converted foul shots, tying him with Gilbert Arenas for the longest run in team history. He wasn't interested in his personal achievements. ""They just outplayed us in every aspect of the game,"" Beal said. TIP-INS Warriors: G D'Angelo Russell was out with a bruised right quadriceps. Russell has been a rumored trade target in advance of Thursday's deadline. ""It affects everyone,"" Kerr said. ""It's no fun having your name mentioned in trade talks. I can speak from experience.

"ATLANTA --  The Celtics turned up the defensive pressure on Trae Young, and turned to Grant Williams for a key basket at the end. It wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch, but it was good enough for Boston's fourth straight win. Jayson Tatum scored 28 points and the Celtics held on for a 123-115 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. ""It was ugly,"" Jaylen Brown said, ""but we figured it out."" Trailing 117-113, the Hawks had a shot when a video review overturned a call along the baseline that initially gave Boston the ball. But Brown came up with a steal off Young's deflected pass at the other end, giving the Celtics a chance to finish it off. They milked the shot clock before Williams took off down the lane, speeding past the Hawks defense to bank one in with 37.6 seconds remaining. Boston coach Brad Stevens knew his team got away with one. ""I don't think throwing the ball all over the gym is a recipe for a win,"" he said, referring to 15 turnovers and some sloppy play down the stretch. With ailing Kemba Walker watching from the bench, Gordon Hayward scored 24 points and Brown chipped in with 21 for the Celtics. Young led Atlanta with 34 points, his 25th game with at least 30 points this season. Kevin Huerter had 23 points, including five 3-pointers, and John Collins notched his fourth straight double-double with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Plagued by injuries, the Hawks were forced to go with a small lineup that didn't have a whole lot of chemistry. That was evident by the struggles of their All-Star point guard, who matched his career high with nine turnovers. ""There were a lot of times when I was jumping in the air and passing, expecting someone to be in the corner, and it just wasn't there,"" Young said. ""I turned it over way too many times tonight. That's a big part of why we lost."" With Young putting up 23 points by halftime, the Hawks held a 62-60 lead at the break. The Celtics scored the first seven points of the third quarter and steadily pushed their edge to as high as 13 points. They were up 95-84 heading to the final period. The Hawks got as close as two, and were still hanging around after back-to-back 3s by Huerter. But Boston never ceded the lead. TIP-INS Celtics: C Enes Kanter returned after missing five games with a right hip contusion. He had eight points and nine rebounds in just under 16 minutes. ... Walker missed his second straight game with a sore left knee. ... Williams had 13 points. ... Hayward started the game as the point guard. ""It really didn't feel that much different,"" he said. ""I had to remind myself to come back and get the ball."" ... Tatum finished 10 of 20 from the field, including 5 of 9 from beyond the arc. Hawks: G Evan Turner played for the first time since Dec. 28. He has been recuperating from both Achilles and hamstring injuries over the past month. Turner didn't do much, tallying two points and two assists in 21 minutes. ... Atlanta started the game with two points guards, as Jeff Teague joined Young in the makeshift lineup. Teague had 18 points. ... Only 10 players suited up for Atlanta. ... The injured list included rookie F Cam Reddish, who went into the league's concussion protocol after taking a blow to the head in Saturday's loss at Dallas. THEIS GOES DOWN Boston forward Daniel Theis went down in the third quarter, landing awkwardly on his right foot after leaping high attempting to block a shot by Atlanta's Treveon Graham. Theis collapsed to the court writhing in pain, and had to be helped to the locker room. After also being checked for a possible concussion, he was cleared to return to the game. But Stevens decided not to take any chances, so Theis finished with nine points in 19 minutes. GOING IT ALONE Collins looked like a one-man show on the inside, often going it alone with the Hawks missing injured big men Alex Len and Bruno Fernando. The Celtics finished with a 44-32 edge on the boards, including 11 offensive rebounds  that contributed greatly to 19 second-chance points. ""The bumps and bruises of the seasons were wearing on us tonight,"" Collins said. ""That's what happens when you play small. You give up some offensive rebounds.""","401161387"

It was like the old Caris, how dynamic he was and athletic and moving great,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said.

They did a good job of taking me out,"" Booker said. Face guarding the whole game. Switching our matchups. So, its one of those nights."" Joe Harris added 16 points and Taurean Prince had 11 of his 15 in the decisive third quarter for the Nets, who will be without Irving at least for this week after he sprained his right knee Saturday at Washington. So Spencer Dinwiddie went back into the starting lineup at point guard and LeVert made his first start since Nov. 10. After that, he had right thumb surgery and missed the next 24 games. A starter in the first nine games of the season, LeVert had struggled in his bench role lately, shooting just 3 for 14 for a total of nine points over the previous two games. Atkinson thought longer stints on the floor could help get the guard back on track. LeVert broke out with some nice drives to the basket along with two 3-pointers and 7-for-7 shooting from the foul line. He even added seven assists and agreed his performance could be a stepping stone. Yeah, I think so,"" he said. Like I said, its definitely good to see the ball going through the basket, be aggressive like I was tonight."" Deandre Ayton had 25 points and 17 rebounds for the Suns, who were even with the Nets for most of the first half but then ran out of gas after halftime in the second of their back-to-back games and lost their third straight. We just lost a bit of our poise tonight,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. It was a three-point game at the half and we didnt make shots in the third."" Neither team led by more than six in a first half that featured 12 ties and nine lead changes and ended with Brooklyn ahead 55-52. LeVert and Prince each scored 11 points in the third, combining for one more than Phoenix had as a team. With the Nets leading by five, Prince had two 3-pointers and LeVert a three-point play in a 13-0 burst that made it 78-60 midway through the third. Brooklyn went on to lead by 26. TIP-INS Suns: The Suns got Ricky Rubio back in the lineup after he missed their loss in Milwaukee on Sunday with right ankle soreness, but they're still weakened by injuries up front to Dario Saric and Aron Baynes. ... Booker had scored 29 or more points in 11 straight road games. Nets: Brooklyn snapped a seven-game losing streak against Western Conference teams. The Nets' last victory over one had been at New Orleans on Dec. 17. ... Dinwiddie had 14 points. SEEKING A REPEAT Harris decided to accept an invitation to defend his 3-point shooting title at the All-Star Game. He won last year in Charlotte but wondered if the break would be better than going to Chicago. Atkinson said the team wouldn't stop him from going. Joes a competitor, man. Joe would go down to the Y if you told him there was a pickup game or a 3-point shooting contest,"" Atkinson said. I dont think any of us would dare hold him back and it was such a joy, such a big positive for our organization, too. Really hope he wins it again. I know hes more than capable. SETTING DOWN THE SUNS The Nets improved to 12-4 against the Suns since moving to Brooklyn in 2012-13. That's their best mark against any opponent.","401161388"
"MIAMI --  Jimmy Butler shook off the notion that a game against his former team should carry extra significance. The win was all that mattered. Butler scored a season-high 38 points before getting the fourth quarter off, and the Miami Heat scored a franchise-record 81 points in the second half to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 137-106 on Monday night. ""I'm never worried about offense,"" Butler said. ""Hell, I'm never worried about defense. I'm only worried about winning."" Goran Dragic scored 24 points for Miami, Duncan Robinson scored 19 and All-Star Bam Adebayo finished with 18 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the Heat. Derrick Jones Jr. added 15 points for Miami, which set season-highs for points and victory margin. Miami also won the season series, 3-1. ""We just want to get better as the season goes on and we knew that this game was important just from the standpoint of being able to go up 3-1 against one of the teams we're jostling against in this competitive Eastern Conference,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It matters."" For Philadelphia, it was more of the same. The team with an NBA-best 22-2 home record lost for the 10th time in its last 12 road games. Joel Embiid led the 76ers with 29 points and 12 rebounds, and Mike Scott scored 17 points -- most of it off 5-of-7 shooting from 3-point range -- in 18 minutes. Ben Simmons had 16 points for Philadelphia. ""Second half we were pretty much nonexistent all around,"" Philadelphia's Tobias Harris said. ""We just never made our mark on the defensive end in the second half."" The 76ers are winning home games by an average of 10 points. But on the road, they've been beaten nine times by double-digits already this season -- and this 31-point defeat came only two days after what had been a season-worst 21-point loss at Brooklyn on Saturday. ""We're not playing defense the way we can play defense,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""It starts and almost stops there for me."" Butler was 14 for 20 from the field and 8 for 8 from the foul line. The Heat committed only three turnovers; its previous franchise-low for a game was four, set against Orlando on Jan. 24, 2009. ""We want Jimmy to be aggressive,"" Dragic said. ""He's our leader."" TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons tried his first 3-pointer since Dec. 10, a beat-the-clock 26-footer at the end of the first quarter that missed. He's now 2 for 23 in his career from beyond the arc. ... Embiid had 11 of Philadelphia's first 17 points. He then had three of the 76ers' next 37 points. ... Former Heat guard Josh Richardson (left hamstring strain) did some on-court work Monday but missed his fifth straight game. Heat: It's unknown if Justise Winslow, who has missed 27 of Miami's last 28 games with a bone bruise in his lower back, will be on the plane Tuesday when Miami leaves for a five-game trip that will last until the start of the All-Star break. ... Butler had never had 38 points through three quarters. He had 37 points after 36 minutes in a game for Chicago in April 2017. INJURIES Meyers Leonard, one of only two Heat players -- Adebayo is the other -- to have started all 49 games this season, needed help to the locker room early in the third quarter after spraining his left ankle. And Tyler Herro left after 10 minutes with right foot soreness, which he tried to play through after being taped up in an unusual way before the game. Spoelstra said Herro has been dealing with the issue, described as a sprain, for about 10 days. BIG LEAD Miami's biggest lead was 35. The only game where the Heat had a bigger lead this season was against Houston on Nov. 3, when they led by 41.","401161389"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Jonas Valanciunas relishes the chance to battle a worthy big man under the basket. Its always a pleasure to fight down low, and not chase the guys on the 3-point line, the Memphis center said with a laugh. In a battle with Detroit's Andre Drummond, Valanciunas had 26 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Grizzlies to a 96-82 victory over the Pistons on Monday night, sweeping the season series. Dillon Brooks added 15 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 14 points. Tyus Jones added 13. Valanciunas also had four blocks. Theres not a lot of big guys left, Valanciunas said. Its always fun to go against a big guy. (Drummond's) a good guy. Hes a good player and its just a pleasure for me to go against him. Drummond held up his end of the showdown with 25 points and 18 rebounds. Langston Galloway and Christian Wood added 17 points each off Detroit's bench. Drummond was 4 of 11 after halftime as the Grizzlies defenders collapsed on him. It just seems like he was getting knocked around and banged around, Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. And again, its sad that officials dont reward size and physicality. While the Grizzlies' offense put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter with a 19-point lead, the defense caused headaches for Detroit throughout the night. Only a 3-pointer by Wood in the closing seconds kept the Pistons from recording a season-low in points. Their 34.7% shooting was also close to a season low. Reggie Jackson finished the game 1 of 16 from the field, and Sekou Doumbouya was 2 of 15. The Grizzlies had a season-high 12 blocks. The Grizzlies held the Pistons to 3 of 25 in the third resulting in a mere 10 points -- a season-low for any Pistons quarter. Ugly. Ugly is the best word I can use, Casey said of the anemic third. It was just the opposite of the way we moved the ball (Sunday in an overtime win over Denver). Memphis beat the Pistons 10 days ago, 125-112, with Drummond out. This time, the Pistons had Drummond but were without leading scorer Derrick Rose and Markieff Morris. That left the Pistons playing a rotation of eight players. The win was only the second time since early December that the Grizzlies did not reach 100 points, and they still had enough to put away a short-handed Detroit squad. Its obviously kind of a funky game, both teams kind of struggling through it, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Our defense wasnt where it needed to be in the first half, especially that first quarter. ... Our guys locked in in that second half. TIP-INS Pistons: Rose missed his eighth game of the season with a left hip adductor strain. Rose left Sundays victory over Denver with the injury. ... Morris also sat out with right hip strain. ... Their season low for points is 81 at Utah on Dec. 30. ... Their season-low on field goal percentage was 33.7% at Chicago on Nov. 20. ... Drummond grabbed at least 15 boards for the fourth time in the last six games. Grizzlies: Jackson and Marko Guduric returned from one-game suspensions handed down by the NBA for leaving the bench during last weeks fracas against the Knicks in New York. ... Earlier Monday, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins was named Western Conference coach of the month for January. ... The Grizzlies previous season high on blocks was 11 on Jan. 28 against Denver. ... The Grizzlies had 68 points in the paint. THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING The trade deadline is approaching this Thursday and Andre Iguodala is speculated to be available. He hasnt played with the Grizzlies all season. Starting Memphis guard Dillon Brooks didnt hold back his feelings when asked about Iguodala in the postgame. I cant wait til we find a way to trade him so we can play him and show him really what Memphis is about, Brooks said.","401161390"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Bogdan Bogdanovic feels a lot more comfortable in Sacramento's starting lineup than he did coming off the bench. Kings coach Luke Walton is certainly happy with the results, although he would prefer Bogdanovic get a little more greedy with his shooting. Bogdanovic scored 23 points and made five free throws in the final 69 seconds, De'Aaron Fox had 31 points and the Kings held off a late run by Minnesota to win 113-109 Monday night, handing the Timberwolves their 12th consecutive loss. It's the second time in six games as a starter that Bogdanovic has scored 23 points. This time he did it on 5-of-7 shooting from the field that he complemented by going 9 for 11 on free throws. ""One thing I tell him is if you're 5 for 7 with 23 points, you should have shot more,"" Walton said. ""That is very efficient of him. But he's such a good shooter that anytime he comes off and the guy's not on him, I want him shooting the ball."" Bogdanovic spent the first three months of the season coming off the bench before Walton decided to make a change by swapping Bogdanovic into the starting lineup in place of Buddy Hield. So far it's worked well for both players. ""He's maybe better as a scorer, I'm better as a playmaker,"" Bogdanovic said. ""Maybe for our team it's better right now but we still have to figure out how to win on the next level, to have more consistent wins."" Hield scored 16 points and Harrison Barnes had 14 points and seven assists for Sacramento. Karl-Anthony Towns had 22 points, 10 rebounds and six assists to lead six Minnesota players in double figures. Shabazz Napier added 17 points and seven assists. ""We're scratching and clawing, and it's tough,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""It's not always positive. We're not in this for marginal victories, we're in this to improve."" It was the third game between the teams this season and the first to end in regulation. Minnesota won in double overtime in December to end an 11-game skid, then Sacramento came back from 17 down with 2:49 remaining in regulation to win last Monday. This one nearly needed extra time, too. Robert Covington's 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left pulled Minnesota to 112-109. After the Kings turned it over on a five-second violation, Andrew Wiggins rushed a 3 that hit off the back of the rim. The Timberwolves haven't won since Jan. 9. The Kings jumped out to a 15-2 lead, went up 60-40 following Fox's breakaway layup in the second quarter and led 65-50 at halftime. Fox provided another spark in the third quarter when he went around Napier and cut past Towns for a one-handed dunk that made it 87-66. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns' double-double was the 257th of his career, moving him past Kevin Love into second place on the franchise list. Kevin Garnett holds the Timberwolves record with 606. . Allen Crabbe (knee) was held out for a third consecutive game. Kings: Fox shot 10 of 16 while topping 30 points for the fourth time this season. TRADE TALKS With Thursday's deadline approaching, several players are keeping a close eye on trade talk. Bogdanovic, a restricted free agent at season's end, has come up as a player Sacramento might be willing to part with. ""You just have to be ready to play no matter what happens. You never know,"" Bogdanovic said. ""It's not in your control.""","401161391"
"LOS ANGELES --  Paul George got beat up again, came back and hit some big shots to help the Los Angeles Clippers rally late. Kawhi Leonard scored 22 points and George added 19 in a 108-105 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night. Leonard's one-handed dunk gave the Clippers a two-point lead with 1:35 remaining after they trailed by 15 in the first half. Leonard then blocked DeMar DeRozan's shot, and George's step-back jumper made it 106-102. Patty Mills hit a 3-pointer with two seconds left to draw the Spurs within one. Lou Williams got fouled and made both for the Clippers. Mills' half-court heave at the buzzer came up short. George got hit in the nose by DeRozan's left elbow at 6:02 of the third. After a video review, DeRozan was called for a flagrant-1 foul. DeRozan was driving to the basket when he struck George, who spun around and went down on his knees holding his face. A trainer brought over a towel to soak up the blood. ""I felt blood start trickling when it first happened and next thing I know it's Niagara Falls flowing,"" George said. ""It's not broken. It's sore. It's larger than usual right now so hopefully just ice it down, help with the swelling."" George has no plans to wear a protective mask. ""Tough cat. I thought it was broke, how it was leaking out there,"" Williams said. Asked if he thought George would return, Clippers coach Doc Rivers joked, ""Yes, we're a hockey team."" George came back in the fourth. On Saturday, he got poked in the eye against Minnesota and stayed in the game. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 27 points and DeRozan added 26 -- but none in the fourth -- for the Spurs, whose two-game winning streak ended. Aldridge had 13 points in the fourth. Patrick Beverley's 3-pointer tied the game for the Clippers for the last time at 102-all. Leonard's streak of nine straight games with at least 30 points ended. George had a season-high 12 rebounds to go with a game-high eight assists. ""There's still more improvement to go,"" Leonard said of the Clippers. ""Came out a little flat and early on not really playing hard on the defensive game, took a little while to pick that up."" The Clippers dominated the third quarter, outscoring the Spurs 31-19, but led by just three going into the fourth. ""We couldn't capitalize and they did off our mistakes -- transitions, dunks, 3s,"" Mills said. The Spurs blew a 15-point first-half lead and the game became a back-and-forth affair over the final two quarters. ""We did a good job upping our energy,"" Williams said. ""We spent too much time feeling them out instead of being forceful."" TIP-INS Spurs: The teams combined to make 12 of 22 shots from 3-point range in the first quarter. Clippers: Leonard's streak of 30-point games was the longest in the NBA this season and the longest by a Clippers player since World B. Free in 1980. ... Leonard missed a one-handed dunk in the third when the ball hit the edge of the backboard. UNDRESSED Jakob Poeltl tried to enter the game in the first quarter, but didn't have his jersey on. The Spurs got a delay-of-game warning as the crowd laughed. Poeltl smiled sheepishly. ""It was a priceless moment,"" Mills said. ""A big, tall, goofy guy walking around, didn't know what to do."" DeRozan said: ""We needed a good laugh. I told him all exposure is good exposure."" KEEP IT TOGETHER George said he hopes the Clippers maintain their current roster through Thursday's trade deadline. ""I enjoy every player on this team, I enjoy this locker room, I'm happy with who is in our locker room,"" he said. POP &amp; KOBE For Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, the death of Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others in a helicopter crash last week remains palpable. ""There's nothing like losing somebody. Nothing like it,"" said Popovich, whose wife died in 2018. ""Nobody knows what it's like unless you've done it, so I really feel for them all. The memories will always be there, but I just feel for the families.""","401161392"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Giannis Antetokounmpo had the strength and savvy to outshine rookie sensation Zion Williamson in the latest double-digit triumph for the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks. Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 17 rebounds, and the Bucks defeated New Orleans 120-108 on Tuesday night. ""He's the former MVP,"" Williamson said when asked about his first experience playing against Antetokounmpo. ""It's like going up against any great player; you do as much as you can to slow him down."" The Pelicans struggled to slow Antetokounmpo, as have many teams this season -- especially recently. The Greek star now has at least 30 points and 15 rebounds in each of his past four games. Antetokounmpo also was a factor on defense. While he usually defends off the ball, coming in late for block attempts or rebounds, he had chances in New Orleans to guard Williamson and even dynamic wing player Brandon Ingram. ""I take pride in that, and whenever I have an opportunity to guard a guy 1-on-1, I like it,"" said Antetokounmpo, whose defensive highlights included catching Williamson from behind on a fast break and swatting his shot out of bounds. On offense, Antetokounmpo's physical dominance was on full display when he transferred the ball from his left to right hand and flipped it in off the glass as Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday pulled forcefully on his left arm in an attempt to stop him from scoring by fouling. Khris Middleton scored 20 for the Bucks, who trailed 61-58 at halftime but broke loose for 42 points in the third quarter, when they led by as many as 19. Ingram scored 32 points and Williamson had 20 for the Pelicans, who briefly got as close as seven twice in the fourth quarter before the Bucks stemmed the tide and improved to 20-4 away from home this season. ""Good win on the road,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We liked the way our defense got better as the game went on."" Milwaukee defended Williamson aggressively, constantly rejecting or fouling him with multiple defenders and often knocking him to the floor. ""We put a lot of guys, a lot of different looks to him,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Just tried to make him guess, just tried to make it tough as possible. You know he's going to try to go left, try to overpower whoever's guarding him, try to go finish strong, and guys behind have got to be active."" It seemed to pay off. Williamson was 5-of-19 shooting with four turnovers, and New Orleans was minus-11 with him on the court. ""It was very physical,"" Williamson said. ""It was one of those nights where I couldn't get my second-jump layup to fall. It was very frustrating, but my teammates were in my ear, telling me to keep going."" Williamson still managed to assert himself early in the fourth quarter. His off-balance floater as he lunged across the lane trimmed the Bucks' lead to 103-96 with 9:26 to go. Later, Williamson ripped a rebound away from Antetokounmpo under the Milwaukee basket, drew a foul and hit two free throws to cut it 107-100. But the Bucks responded with Brook Lopez's layup and Wesley Matthews' fifth 3-pointer of the game to push their advantage back to 12. Matthews demoralized New Orleans by reliably hitting open 3s in transition. He hit five from deep and finished with 17 points. ""He was focused. He was playing defense. He was knocking down shots. He was talking to everybody,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It was amazing."" By contrast, the Pelicans missed 35 of their 49 attempts from 3-point range, hitting just three of 19 in the second half. TIP-INS Bucks: Came in outscoring opponents by 12.4 points per game and just about equaled that average. ... Matched their NBA-best average of 120 points per game. ... Hit the 110-point mark for an 11th straight game. ... Improved their NBA-best record to 43-7 with their 11th victory in 12 games. Pelicans: Lonzo Ball had 11 points and 14 rebounds. ... JJ Redick scored 13 points. ... Williamson was 10 of 14 from the free throw line. ... New Orleans shot 38.8% (38 of 98). IMPRESSED NONETHELESS Bucks players spoke highly of Williamson after their first up-close look at him. ""He's a beast, man,"" Middleton said. ""He's going to have a heck of a career. He's a smart player. He creates so much force in that paint with the ball in his hands. He's going to learn how to be a better player also, which I think is a scary thing to see."" Added Antetokounmpo: ""He'll be a good player for a lot of years to come. ... He's just got to stay healthy and he's going to have a bright future.""","401161393"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden has regained his shooting touch and that's helped the Houston Rockets go on a winning streak despite injuries to other starters. Harden had 40 points and 11 assists, and the short-handed Rockets overcame an early deficit to beat the Charlotte Hornets 125-110 on Tuesday night. Houston won its third straight, handing Charlotte its fourth consecutive loss and 12th in 13 games. Harden finished a rebound shy of a triple-double after also scoring 40 points but falling one assist short of a triple-double in Houston's last game. He's scored at least 35 points in each of his past three games after struggling through a shooting slump over the previous four. The Rockets got off to a slow start and trailed throughout most of the first half on a night when they played without starters Clint Capela and Russell Westbrook, who sat out with injuries. Harden has carried a huge load for Houston during the winning streak, with Capela sidelined for all three games and Westbrook joining him on the bench Tuesday night. But Harden was quick to point out that he's had some help. ""Guys are out with injuries, next guy has the opportunity to step up and play well,"" he said. ""And obviously I think everyone played well tonight, not just offensively but defensively, being in the right spots."" The Hornets led early in the fourth before the Rockets used a 15-2 run to take control midway through the quarter and cruise the rest of the way. Coach Mike D'Antoni was impressed that the Rockets picked it up in the second half to avoid heading to play the Lakers with a loss. ""They picked up their energy,"" he said. ""It was a tough game, one of those where after a couple of emotional games we get one without Russell and have to head to L.A. for the next game, (so) this was kind of a trap game where they could get you. But they understood what they were risking and came out after halftime and did the job."" Miles Bridges and Terry Rozier had 20 points each for the Hornets, and Malik Monk added 19 off the bench. Charlotte coach James Borrego was happy to see his young team stay with the Rockets for much of the game. ""We competed from the start and came out with a great mindset ... we battled tonight,"" he said. ""We got off to a great start, we competed for 48 minutes and I'm proud of the group -- great effort."" Bridges made a 3-pointer to get Charlotte within eight with about 2 1/2 minutes left, but Harden scored the next seven points to push Houston's lead to 125-110 with about a minute to go. Harden hit a 3 before stepping back to make another one as he was fouled by Cody Martin. Harden fell onto his backside and smiled broadly as he watched the shot go in before making the free throw to complete a four-point play that sealed the victory. The Rockets led by four entering the fourth quarter but consecutive 3s by Devonte' Graham put the Hornets up 101-98 with about eight minutes left. Charlotte's lead was short-lived, as Houston went on a 10-2 run, with five points from Harden, to make it 108-103 midway through the fourth. The Hornets called a timeout, but it didn't stop Houston's run as Danuel House made a 3 seconds after the timeout. Soon after that Martin got hit in the nose by teammate Cody Zeller's elbow while the two were fighting for a rebound. Martin crouched to the ground holding his face as blood poured onto the court. He was quickly taken to the locker room, but it took a few minutes to clean the blood off the floor and resume play. House added a dunk on an alley-oop after that to extend Houston's lead to 113-103. Martin returned from the locker room with about five minutes left in the quarter and he re-entered the game with about three minutes to go. Charlotte led by 15 early but Houston ended the third quarter on a 10-4 run, with 3s from Ben McLemore and Austin Rivers, to take a 92-88 lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Hornets: PJ Washington returned after missing two games with a sprained right ankle. ... Charlotte had 17 turnovers. ... The Hornets outrebounded Houston 53-41. Rockets: House added 22 points and nine rebounds. ... Eric Gordon scored 16 points and P.J. Tucker had 13 points and 10 rebounds. ... Capela sat out for the fourth time in five games. D'Antoni said Capela won't return until he's pain-free. ... D'Antoni said he expects Westbrook, who has a sprained left thumb, to return Thursday night. 120 The Rockets have scored 120 points or more in four of their last eight games after reaching the mark only three times in their previous 13 games. Houston is 18-2 when scoring at least 120 this season. It's just the second time in franchise history and first since the 1969-70 season that the Rockets have scored 120 points 20 times in the first 50 games of a season.","401161394"
"DENVER --  The combination of Gary Harris and Torrey Craig was too much for Damian Lillard and the Trail Blazers to overcome. Not on offense, but defense. Harris and Craig hounded the hot-shooting Lillard all evening and never let him get on track as the Denver Nuggets routed Portland 127-99 on Tuesday. Everybody was connected, said Nikola Jokic, who finished with 29 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists in just three quarters. ""Everybody had the same goal -- to stop Dame."" This wasn't the same Lillard the Nuggets have seen in the past, though. This was a guy who had been shooting out of this world. Until Tuesday, that is, when Denver finally contained Lillard, ending his string of eight straight games with at least 30 points. Lillard was held to 21 on 8 of 23 from the floor, predominantly with Harris and Craig taking turns shadowing him. Well, that and the 7-foot Jokic backing them up. I didn't have as many clean looks, but I still feel like I had some looks that I could have made,"" Lillard said. ""I thought they got away with a lot, too, just being physical. Stopping Lillard has proved a tough assignment these days. He averaged 48.8 points over his last six games entering Tuesday. What's more, he was shooting 57% from 3-point range during that streak. In this game, he was 1 of 6. We did a good job collectively ... of not letting him get easy shots and get into a rhythm, said Craig, who finished with seven points. We always play pretty good defense against him as a team. Lillard had nine assists. He didn't play in the fourth quarter. Tonight just wasn't our night, Lillard said. ""They made shots. They executed better than we did. We just weren't at our best. The Nuggets pulled away in the second quarter when they outscored the Blazers by a 27-10 margin. The 10 points were a season low for a quarter by Portland. The 38 points at halftime were also a low mark for the season. Denver led by 34 in the third, and Jokic was given the final quarter off. The big man had two chances to pick up his 10th assist before exiting late in the third, but Craig missed a left-handed layup and Malik Beasley a wide-open 3-pointer. Jokic has 10 triple-doubles this season. The short-handed Nuggets were without Paul Millsap (bruised left knee), Mason Plumlee (right foot) and Michael Porter Jr. (right ankle). Jamal Murray returned to the lineup after missing 10 games with a sprained left ankle. He finished with 20 points. Felt good,"" Murray said, even if his ankle was tender after the game. Felt really good. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: CJ McCollum was called for a flagrant-1 foul when he hip-checked Craig on a drive in the second quarter. McCollum had 20 points. ... F Nassir Little was helped off the court after rolling his left ankle with 37.9 seconds remaining. Nuggets: F Jerami Grant hobbled off the floor in the fourth quarter after turning his right ankle. Grant finished with 17 points. ... It was Denver's seventh straight home win over Portland. ... Denver improved to 8-0 against Northwest Division rivals this season TRADE DEADLINE Nuggets coach Michael Malone doesn't give Thursday's trade deadline much thought. He leaves that to president of basketball operations Tim Connelly &amp; Co. ""If you read my business card, it says head coach,"" Malone cracked.

JAMES FOR JANUARY Lakers forward LeBron James was named the NBA Western Conference player of the month for January after averaging 25.4 points, 8.1 rebounds and 10.4 assists. Lillard's numbers in the month were equally as impressive: 34.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 8.4 assists.

"Take a look back at some of Dwight Howard's best dunks from the NBA dunk contest. (2:10) LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James absorbed contact and tumbled to the court while his fifth 3-pointer in a three-minute span dropped through the net. The Los Angeles Lakers' entire roster left the bench and crossed the court, gleefully picking up their leader while a sellout crowd roared. ""That's what we're all about,"" James said. ""Our team, anytime anyone is having success in the game, we cheer like it's our own. So having that camaraderie, having that brotherhood, even though they're beating you up, it's just a pretty cool feeling."" Nine days after Kobe Bryant's death, the Lakers finally had an evening that felt like a return to normalcy. Well, as normal as anything can be when King James is performing feats of basketball brilliance. James scored 19 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter with that incredible 3-point barrage, propelling the Lakers to a 129-102 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night. James added nine assists and seven rebounds, while Anthony Davis and Kyle Kuzma had 18 points apiece as the Lakers beat San Antonio for the third time, sweeping the season series. After the Spurs chipped away at the Lakers' big lead late in the third quarter, James and Kuzma put the game away with a combined seven 3-pointers in 3 1/2 minutes to start the fourth. James' shots seemed to increase in difficulty with each possession, but he buried them all. ""When the guy gets hot like that, it's always fun to watch him,"" Davis said, laughing at the Lakers' group celebration after the final 3. ""It wasn't the plan. We all just kind of ran over there and jumped on him."" DeMar DeRozan had 28 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in his hometown for the Spurs, who have lost five of seven. San Antonio was outrebounded 58-28 by the bigger Lakers, and the Spurs grabbed only three rebounds in the fourth quarter while the Lakers went 16 of 24 from the field. When asked what the Spurs can do when James gets rolling, coach Gregg Popovich quipped: ""Make sure you get good pictures."" Bryn Forbes added 13 points, but one night after the Spurs blew a late lead in a three-point loss to the Clippers, they returned to Staples Center and fell to 0-2 at the start of San Antonio's eight-game road trip while a rodeo occupies AT&amp;T Center. ""As a competitor, it's what you want to play against,"" DeRozan said of the LA back-to-back. ""I don't look at it like it's being tough. It's part of the job, part of the game, and as a competitor you want to compete against the best. You worry about the toll afterwards."" The Lakers returned to a semblance of normalcy at Staples Center in their first home game since their emotionally charged return last Friday for their first game following Bryant's death. Bryant's two retired jerseys still remain isolated in a spotlight on the wall high above the court, and the Lakers crowd broke into a spontaneous chant of ""Kobe! Kobe!"" in the third quarter, and the chant returned in the final seconds of the game. TIP-INS Spurs: They don't return home until Feb. 26. ... Dejounte Murray scored 12 points. Lakers: JaVale McGee had 14 points. ... James was asked about the analytics theory that a hot hand doesn't exist: ""I guarantee the analytics person or people has never ever been in a zone in their life."" THINKING OF KOBE Before the game, Popovich gave a stirring answer to a question about Bryant's place in the game. The U.S. Olympic team assistant coach said Bryant ""was special to all of us in different ways. ... He was like a superhero who was actually human. There aren't any superheroes that are really human, but we kind of thought of him as one of those kind of people."" ""When somebody's sick for a long time and you expect it, you deal with that. But when somebody is taken the way that he and his daughter and all the other people were taken, that makes it a tragedy and more painful in some ways,"" Popovich said. KUZ EXCELS Kuzma, the subject of numerous trade rumors with the deadline approaching, added 12 rebounds in one of his most impressive recent performances. Lakers coach Frank Vogel said the third-year pro ""just had a little extra pop the last few games, and it showed up in the mindset to play hard."" Kuzma professed ignorance of the trade deadline looming Thursday, saying he has grown immune to the constant speculation about his future throughout his LA career. ""Kobe would always tell me, `If they're not talking about you, you should be worried,"" Kuzma said. ""And I'm the talk of the town, so ..."" DWIGHT'S REGRET Dwight Howard had 12 points and 11 rebounds while shooting 5 for 5 in another strong all-around performance for the Lakers. Howard also revealed Bryant had agreed to help him in the dunk contest later this month during All-Star weekend in Chicago. Howard had recently made it known that he wanted to do a dunk with Bryant involved. ""I didn't get a chance to tell him how appreciative I was for our time together, how thankful I was,"" Howard said of Bryant, his teammate with the Lakers in the tumultuous 2012-13 season. ""That was pretty hard for me. I took it pretty hard. ... It still doesn't even seem real.""","401161396"
"DETROIT --  Andre Drummond wasn't about to predict where he'd be playing in a couple days. ""Your guess is as good as mine,"" he said. ""I don't know what's going to happen. I'm going to go to sleep tonight and wake up and find out what happens."" Drummond had 31 points and 19 rebounds, and the Detroit Pistons handed the Phoenix Suns their fourth straight loss, 116-108 on Wednesday night. There's been trade speculation about Drummond, and this was Detroit's last game before Thursday's trade deadline. He had 20 points and 11 rebounds by halftime and finished just two points shy of his career high. He was asked afterward if the possibility of this being his last game with the Pistons had crossed his mind. ""I've been hearing that for the past four years,"" he said. ""It don't faze me."" Reggie Jackson added 25 points for Detroit and Christian Wood had 21. Kelly Oubre Jr. led the Suns with 30. The Pistons led 101-94 in the fourth quarter after a 3-pointer by Wood, but the Suns scored the next six points to close within one. Detroit answered with a 9-2 run capped by Jackson's 3-pointer. It was the 402nd double-double for Drummond, putting him in a tie with Bill Laimbeer for third on the team's career list. Deandre Ayton scored 26 points for the Suns and Devin Booker added 22. Ricky Rubio had no points and 10 assists at halftime, but he had only one assist and four points the rest of the way. ""We have to continue to grow and mature in order to stay solid, to stay focused for 48 minutes,"" Oubre said. ""I think that's the best teams who can follow the game plan, do what they do consistently for 48 minutes."" Detroit led 64-61 after two quarters. DEPTH Detroit's bench outscored Phoenix's 39-13, with Wood leading the way. Langston Galloway contributed 15 points for the Pistons. Coach Dwane Casey, however, was not happy with rookies Jordan Bone and Louis King, who combined for three points in minimal playing time. ""Bone, Sekou (Doumbouya) and King. Both, I didn't think they played hard enough. I wanted to play them longer, but when you go in, you've got to go in chewing nails, and I didn't see that,"" Casey said. ""I told them, next stop will be (G League) Grand Rapids if they're not going to come in. Because this is an opportunity for them, but it's not going to be given to them."" Doumbouya, also a rookie, started and scored five points in 15:58. King made a 3-pointer in the third quarter, then was immediately called for a technical foul, apparently for taunting. SHARP SHOOTING Both teams shot over 40% from 3-point range. Detroit was 12 of 28 and Phoenix was 12 of 26. ""Just couldn't get enough of them,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""I didn't think that we responded well to them blitzing (Booker) tonight. I think the simple play is there."" TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix was without Dario Saric (left ankle), Tyler Johnson (right knee), Ty Jerome (left calf), Aron Baynes (left hip) and Cameron Johnson (right quad). ... Ayton had 12 rebounds, four assists and four blocks. He surpassed 100 blocked shots for his career. Pistons: Detroit has been without Blake Griffin because of left knee surgery. The Pistons were also missing Derrick Rose (left hip), Luke Kennard (knee), Markieff Morris (illness) and Svi Mykhailiuk (right hip). ... Seven of Drummond's 19 rebounds were at the offensive end. Detroit had 17 second-chance points to Phoenix's eight.","401161397"
"BOSTON --  When the Celtics have needed an offensive lift this season, Jayson Tatum has often been the one to pick up the scoring load. He did it again to help Boston fend off a Magic team fighting to stay in playoff contention. Tatum scored 16 of his 33 points in the second half and the Celtics held off Orlando 116-100 on Wednesday night. Gordon Hayward added 23 points and Jaylen Brown finished with 18 to help Boston win its fifth straight. It was Tatum's sixth game this season with 30 or more points. Just confidence has a lot to do with it -- opportunity, and just trying to get better,"" he said. ""Trying to get better in all aspects of my game each year and each summer. Just trying to be a better version of myself than I was last year. Orlando pulled within 105-98 with less than three minutes to play on a basket by Nik Vucevic. The Celtics responded with back-to-back 3-pointers by Hayward and Tatum that made it 111-98 with 1:46 left. Evan Fournier led the Magic with 26 points. Aaron Gordon added 23 points and 10 rebounds. Terrence Ross finished with 18 points. Orlando lost for the sixth time in seven games. Boston played extremely short-handed with Kemba Walker (sore left knee), Marcus Smart (right quad contusion), Daniel Theis (right ankle sprain) and Robert Williams (left hip edema) all sitting out. Rookie Romeo Langford made his first-career start in Walker's absence. After being held to three points in the third quarter, Tatum scored 10 straight points to give Boston a 99-91 lead with 6:52 remaining. Then, following a timeout, Tatum led a fast break and found Brown, who threw down a one-handed dunk over Michael Carter-Williams to give the Celtics the game's first double-digit advantage. He's an All-Star for a reason,"" Gordon said of Tatum. Kemba was out, he stepped up."" Hayward said he and his teammates made up for what they didn't have on the court by playing hard and sticking to the game plan. We battled, Hayward said. Some of it is just being able to experience playing with each other more and more. We've had guys in and out of the lineup all year, so we kind of get used to that. The Magic took an early 12-5 lead in the first quarter before the Celtics closed the period on a 27-12 run. Tatum was sidelined with a groin strain for Boston's win at Orlando last month. He had the hot hand for the Celtics early, scoring 17 points in the opening 24 minutes as Boston took a 57-56 lead into halftime. I think some things have slowed down a little bit, Tatum said. ""I was playing with aggression early in the season, missing a lot of easy shots in the paint. For me it's all about reading the defense and whatever they give me."" TIP-INS Magic: D.J. Augustin missed his 10th consecutive game with left knee bone irritation. Celtics: Tatum has scored in double figures in a career-best 37 consecutive games. EARLY EXIT Referee Aaron Smith left the court with undisclosed injury in the first quarter and did not return. Officials Leon Wood and Marc Davis completed the game as a two-man crew. HIGH CEILING Friday will mark the one-year anniversary of Orlando acquiring Markelle Fultz in a trade with the 76ers. The Magic couldnt be happier with how the former No. 1 overall pick is fitting in after two seasons in Philadelphia plagued by injuries and shooting problems. Fultz played his 50th game of the season Wednesday -- more than his first two seasons combined (33). He also entered the game averaging a career-high 11.7 points and team-best 4.8 assists. Magic coach Steve Clifford said he expects both numbers will continue to rise as he continues to get healthy. Hes still not 100 percent. If you saw what he has to do every day to get ready to play -- as his knee, his shoulder, his wrist get better hes gonna play better, Clifford said. Theres a reason he was the No. 1 pick in a really talented draft class.","401161398"
"Coach Steve Kerr says the Warriors ""struggled tonight under the circumstances,"" with players such as D'Angelo Russell involved in trade rumors. (0:38) NEW YORK --  Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks are respected veterans on a gutted Golden State team, guys who helped them look like the Warriors of old recently. And when word came that they were likely getting traded, the rest of the roster couldn't summon much spirit to play without them. The Nets ran them all off the floor, giving D'Angelo Russell a bruising welcome back to Brooklyn with a 129-88 rout on Wednesday night. We were messed up as a team,"" Russell said. Guys that have been riding with us since training camp. You develop a bond in this league and when it goes like that, we're human, so it's hard for you to just go out there and escape that."" The Warriors held out Robinson and Burks on the eve of the NBA's trade deadline. For the team to find out that those two guys are most likely going to be traded was pretty tough,"" coach Steve Kerr said. So we all kind of just found out prior to the game. Theres not a very good way to prepare for a game when something like that happens and I think it showed."" The guys who did play for the Warriors fell behind 20-4, missed 20 of their 22 3-point attempts in the first half and trailed by as many as 44 points against a Nets defense that forward Joe Harris said was locked in. But then a little bit of that I think can be attributed to ... the fact that theyre kind of going through sort of an unfortunate time with guys getting traded right before the game and to be at the end of a long road trip,"" Harris said. Caris LeVert scored 23 points, Harris added 17 and Garrett Temple had 16 for the Nets, who beat the Warriors for the first time in nearly five years. LeVert, after tying his career high with 29 points in his last outing, also had eight assists. Russell got a nice ovation from fans, a tribute video from the Nets, and nothing else he'll want to remember about the night. He scored 17 points but was 0 for 8 from 3-point range and the Warriors were outscored by 29 points in his 18 first-half minutes. Heck of a player. Glad we slowed him down a little, but definitely an advantage when you know a guy,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Golden State finished 5 for 39 (13%) from beyond the arc. Russell had two good seasons in Brooklyn and was a first-time All-Star last season. But he was expendable once the Nets signed Kyrie Irving and he was sent to Golden State in a sign-and-trade deal that brought Kevin Durant to Brooklyn. Russell's name has also been connected to trade reports and he sat out Monday in Washington with what was called a bruised right quadriceps, but he returned to the starting lineup Wednesday. Fans chanted Thank you, D-Lo! Thank you, D-Lo! in appreciation of his role in leading Brooklyn back to the postseason last year. The Warriors were coming off their first consecutive 120-point outings of the season. Robinson had back-to-back performances of 20 or more points for the first time in his career during those victories, and Burks scored 30 on Monday in Washington. The Nets rang up 40 points in the first quarter and were ahead 95-64 after three, their largest lead at home after three quarters since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State finished 2/3 on its trip through the East. ... Kerr said he was happy for Warriors assistant Mike Brown, who will coach Nigeria's men's basketball team in the Olympics. Nets: Durant shared a hug and conversation with former teammate Stephen Curry after the game. ... Brooklyn has won four straight home games. ... The 31-point margin was the Nets' largest lead at home after three since they were ahead of Denver by 37 on Feb. 7, 2009. HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE Atkinson said he pays no attention to trade rumors, focusing only on coaching his players. Kerr is just the opposite. A former player and general manager, he thinks it's important in his role as coach to know what is being reported. Im an NBA fan as well as a coach. I want to know whats going on around the league, so I read a lot of the stuff,"" Kerr said. Given where we are as a team, things can affect our group. So I need to be up to date on whats happening so that I can be aware of what our players are reading and what theyre seeing, because its not easy to go through the trade deadline as a player. Ive been there before."" EIGHT IS ENOUGH The Warriors had won eight straight meetings since the Nets' last victory on March 2, 2015. It was their longest current winning streak and Brooklyn's longest current skid against any opponent.","401161399"
"TORONTO --  Serge Ibaka had missed five of his six attempts from 3-point range, but didnt hesitate when it was time to take the biggest shot of the game. Ibaka hit a go-ahead 3 with 30 seconds remaining and the Toronto Raptors rallied from 19 down to beat the Indiana Pacers 119-118 Wednesday night, setting a franchise record with their 12th consecutive victory. He deserved it because hes been working his tail off on his shooting, Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Kyle Lowry had 32 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, and Ibaka scored a season-high 30 as Toronto fought back after trailing by 11 with less than four minutes to play. The defending NBA champions scored the final 11 points of the game. We play 48 minutes, Lowry said. Thats how we play. We gave ourselves a chance, put the press on, made some shots, got aggressive and played better defense down the stretch. Torontos closing offense was pretty good, too. A trio of Raptors scored in double figures in the fourth, led by Ibakas 15 points. Ibaka said a pep talk from Nurse inspired him to keep firing even after he struggled from distance early. Nick told me in a timeout, Serge, keep shooting with confidence, just push the ball, Ibaka said. He gave me a lot of confidence. Pascal Siakam scored 25 points, Terence Davis had 11 and Fred VanVleet added 10 to help the Raptors earn their 12th straight home win over Indiana. Malcolm Brogdon scored 24 points and Justin Holiday added a season-best 22, but the Pacers lost their third straight overall. Domantas Sabonis had 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his third career triple-double. Poor execution the last five minutes of the game, Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Indiana guard Victor Oladipo started for the first time since returning from injury last week and scored a season-high 13 points in 25 minutes. I feel like I played a little better today, Oladipo said. I could actually feel my legs kind of getting under me, especially defensively. Its a tough loss, obviously, but theres a lot of basketball left, he added. Weve just got to continue to keep getting better, keep getting stronger, and getting healthy as well. Everything else will take care of itself. Toronto was the opponent in January 2019 when Oladipo had to be carried off the court on a stretcher because of a ruptured tendon in his right knee. Oladipo played seven minutes in the first quarter, then checked back in with 4:17 left in the first half. He started the second half and was replaced by Aaron Holiday with 3:24 remaining in the third period. Oladipo returned for his final stint with 5:34 left in the fourth and closed out the game. Holiday shot 6 for 9 from 3-point range and Brogdon went 4 of 7 as the Pacers finished 19 for 39 from deep, a season high for made 3s. Torontos Rondae Hollis-Jefferson returned after missing four games because of a sprained right ankle. He did not score in 13 minutes. The Raptors trailed 106-103 after Siakams driving dunk with 5:05 left, but Holiday made a 3, Oladipo hit a jumper and Brogdon connected from deep to put the Pacers up 114-103 with 3:50 to go. Siakam hit one of two at the line with 1:15 left to bring Toronto within four, then forced a steal and drove for a layup to make it 118-116 with 1:06 remaining. The Pacers called a timeout and gave the ball to Oladipo, but his shot didnt fall, leading to Ibakas go-ahead 3 at the other end. Oladipo missed a 3 with 10 seconds to play and VanVleet stripped Brogdon to seal an historic win for Toronto. TIP-INS Pacers: Outscored the Raptors 55-22 in bench points.  Indiana is 13-13 on the road.  Doug McDermott scored 19 points. Raptors: C Marc Gasol missed his fourth straight game because of a sore left hamstring, while G Norman Powell sat out for the second consecutive game because of a broken ring finger on his left hand. Both players are out indefinitely. SLOPPY The Pacers allowed 27 points off 19 turnovers, the most by an Indiana opponent this season.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  After a dizzying 24 hours, the Atlanta Hawks gave Clint Capela and the rest of their new teammates a glimpse of their young cores potential. The Minnesota Timberwolves, meanwhile, struggled to find energy in their 13th straight loss, with their best defensive player, Robert Covington, already in his new city. Trae Young had 38 points and 11 assists and John Collins added 27 points and 12 rebounds to lead Atlanta past Minnesota 127-120 Wednesday night, as both teams braced for major roster shifts. Collins had his fifth straight double-double for the Hawks, who prepared to add Capela and Nene from Houston as part of Wednesdays four-team, 12-player trade that will also send Covington and Jordan Bell from Minnesota to the Rockets. Then during the game, the Hawks reportedly made another trade. The team wouldnt confirm details of the reported move. I was shocked, Young said. Obviously, Im still in my second year. This is my first time ever experiencing a trade happening during a game, for me. Its new. "" The teams capped the long day by making the four-team trade official after the game. The last 24 hours, I havent slept much, said Karl-Anthony Towns, who grew close to Covington after he landed in Minnesota last season following the trade that sent disgruntled Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia. Covington arrived in Houston earlier in the day. In a game featuring teams with 28 combined wins -- not to mention Minnesotas lengthy skid -- this one had some intrigue, although not for the on-court action. During halftime, the Hawks officially announced they waived Chandler Parsons to help to clear the way for Capela and Nene. Definitely a crazier night, at least day, when you look at our entire roster and whats happened in the last 24 hours, Collins said. WOEFUL WOLVES Besides their losing skid, the Wolves were also reeling from the loss of locker-room personalities. Aside from Covington and Bell, the Wolves also parted ways with Shabazz Napier, Keita Bates-Diop and Noah Vonleh in the trade. Those guys are big parts of the locker room and for us to lose all of them, obviously it changes a lot, Towns said. It changes the vibe up here because were missing four amazing guys first off, and four guys that we all count on for energy. Minnesota, meanwhile, is expected to receive Evan Turner from Atlanta, along with Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt and Juancho Hernangomez from Denver. OH YEAH, THERE WAS A GAME, TOO Young and Collins had 20 and 15 points, respectively, by halftime. Collins had a double-double midway through the third quarter, and Young had some impressive alley-oops to Collins. Andrew Wiggins scored 25 and Josh Okogie 23 to lead the Wolves, who made it a game with a late 19-7 run in a too-little, too-late bid. Towns finished with 21 points. The Wolves never led and struggled to recover from an early 14-4 run at the end of the first quarter that had them playing catch up the rest of the way. Atlanta led by as many as 21 points. They certainly missed Covington, one of their better defenders since arriving last season. Towns completed a three-point play with 1:25 remaining to cut Atlanta's lead to seven and Okogie's dunk with 48.4 to play made it 122-117. Vince Carter hit a 3-pointer, Okogie missed a 3, and the Hawks shot free throws the rest of the way. At this point, well take the win Hawks coach Llyod Pierce said. Its a good team win, good road win. A lot of adversity going on right now. TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce said Capela probably will not join the team on its current road trip.  Young had his 12th game with at least 30 points and 10 assists, tying for the league lead. ... PG Jeff Teague and and G Treveon Graham returned to Minnesota for the first time since being traded on Jan. 16 in exchange for Allen Crabbe. Teague scored nine points and had an impressive block on Jordan McLaughlin during a fast-break.  Bruno Fernando left the game with a strained left calf. Timberwolves: The Wolves allowed 23 points off 17 turnovers.  Crabbe had two points against his old team.","401161401"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Chris Paul told Dennis Schroder to take over, and his backcourt mate listened. Schroder scored 30 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 109-103 on Wednesday night. Schroder had six points in a critical 43-second span late in the game that helped the Thunder grab control. Paul, an All-Star who usually is a primary scoring option late in close games, willingly deferred. ""Chris, he handled it well because he'd seen that I was aggressive, made a couple of shots, free throws, so he was like, `Oh, you have it. Close the game,"" Schroder said. ""When Chris Paul tells you that, it keeps you engaged, you get more energy, you're getting a little hyped, and I finished it off."" It was Schroder's eighth straight game with at least 20 points. He was a reserve in seven of those games, including this one. ""He's really playing at a high level and he's done a really, really good job for us and he's been a great spark off the bench,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 23 points and Danilo Gallinari added 15 for the Thunder, who have won eight of nine. Gallinari was the subject of trade speculation throughout the day. He chose to focus on the game. ""My parents told me a great thing when I was a little kid -- to not read newspapers or follow media,"" Gallinari said. ""I really don't follow any kind of stuff, especially game day."" Collin Sexton scored 23 points and Kevin Love had 20 for the Cavaliers, who have lost 12 of 13. ""Executing,"" Love said. ""That's our next evolution, is to keep trending that way. And then I believe on the defensive end, just really getting our coverages down. We had some slip-ups tonight where we're kind of looking at each other talking about the game plan, and we just need to make sure that we lock in on that 100 percent."" The Thunder led 61-53 at halftime behind 15 points from Schroder and 12 from Gilgeous-Alexander and Gallinari. Oklahoma City shot 52.4% before the break. Cleveland led briefly in the third quarter after an early rally, but the Thunder took an 84-81 lead into the fourth. Larry Nance Jr.'s dynamic dunk cut Oklahoma City's lead to 89-87. Schroder was whistled for a technical after he disagreed with an offensive foul call against him with 3:42 remaining and the Thunder leading 95-94. The play was reviewed and the offensive foul was reversed, but the technical still stood. Cleveland tied the game at 95 on a free throw by Love. Schroder hit two free throws with just under a minute left to put Oklahoma City up by three. After a turnover by Cleveland, Schroder hit a corner 3-pointer with 28.3 seconds remaining to push the lead to 106-100. ""It felt good,"" Schroder said. ""Everybody was standing up already, so I had to make it. It's a lot of pressure, but it felt great."" Schroder made one of two free throws with 20.1 seconds left. A few seconds later, he forced Sexton into a turnover that sealed the game. ""I think a lot of people will look at the offensive play that he made, the 3 and all that, but that steal that he got on Collin was the play of the game,"" Paul said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: F/C Tristan Thompson sat out with a sore right quadriceps. John Henson got the start and finished with 11 rebounds. ... Sexton scored 12 points in the first quarter. ... Nance grabbed 10 rebounds as a reserve. Thunder: G Terrance Ferguson missed eight straight games for personal reasons and returned to practice this week.

QUOTABLE Paul, on reporters asking Ferguson about coming of the bench: ""Y'all asking him about not starting tonight? That's tough. Don't do that to him, you know what I mean? Selfless guy like that who wants to win and stuff like that. So if y'all can -- and I know y'all got a job to do -- but respect him, too, to not try to put him against his teammate like that."" Ferguson had started all 36 games he had played in this season.","401161402"
"DALLAS --  The Memphis Grizzlies are making big strides on the court and significant moves off it. Ja Morant scored 21 points, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Tyus Jones added 19 apiece, and the short-handed Grizzlies beat the Dallas Mavericks 121-107 on Wednesday night to move over .500 for the first time this season. Dillon Brooks had 18 points for Memphis, which took advantage of Luka Doncic's absence for Dallas despite playing without forwards Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill. They left the team before the game due to pending trades that also included Andre Iguodala, who elected not to play for the Grizzlies after being acquired from Golden State last offseason. Justise Winslow is headed to Memphis from the Miami Heat in a deal for Iguodala, according to reports. Brooks said he was glad that situation has been resolved. A few days ago, he said he welcomed the chance to play against Iguodala. ""Now we have a player that we're getting that actually wants to play with us and thinks we're good,"" Brooks said. After their win, the Grizzlies announced that Brooks signed a multi-year contract extension. ESPN.com reported it was for $35 million over three years. The third-year swingman is averaging a career-best 16.1 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 28.4 minutes through 51 games. He is the only Memphis player to play and start in every game this season. Morant said he didn't care that the Iguodala drama with the Grizzlies has apparently ended. ""That's in the past. It's over with,"" he said. ""We're going to play with the players that's on the floor."" The surging Grizzlies (26-25) won for the 13th time in 16 games. Looking for their first playoff berth since 2017, they lead Portland by three games for the final postseason spot in the Western Conference. ""They believe in each other. They believe in their teammates,"" first-year Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""I know that's kind of cliche to say, whatever, but it's the fact."" Kristaps Porzingis had 32 points and 12 rebounds for the Mavericks in his third straight 30-point game. Porzingis left briefly with 4:06 remaining in the third quarter with a bloody nose after being elbowed by Josh Jackson while going for a rebound. ""It's broken, but it's OK,"" Porzingis said. ""I really didn't have a headache or anything."" Porzingis exited after Memphis broke a 71-all tie and rattled off 10 straight points. The Grizzlies' run increased to 21-3 for a 92-74 lead with 1:22 left in the period, and they led by as many as 25 in the fourth quarter. The Mavericks (31-20) were trying to reach 13 games over .500 for the first time this season. ""Ugly game for us,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. The Mavericks played their fourth straight game since Doncic, the second-year guard voted an All-Star starter, sprained his right ankle in practice last Thursday. They are 2-2 in those games and 4-5 this season minus Doncic, including the Dec. 14 game vs. Miami in which he left two minutes in with a sprained ankle. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Jones' 19 points were a career high. ... Jenkins, who grew up in Dallas, met with family before and after the game and with student journalists from his high school, St. Mark's School of Texas. ... The Grizzlies have won three straight road games over Dallas for the first time. Mavericks: Seth Curry missed his second straight game with left knee tightness, and J.J. Barea sat out after leaving Dallas' previous game Monday night in the second quarter with a sprained left ankle. THE INSIDE STORY The Grizzlies went into play averaging an NBA-high 56.4 points in the paint, 49.9% of their scoring. They scored 60 in the paint Wednesday, for 49.6%. It was the 21st time this season they've scored at least 60 points in the paint. THE OUTSIDE STORY The Mavericks' strength has been just the opposite, with a league-high 39% of their scoring coming from behind the 3-point arc. On Wednesday, they scored 47.7% of their points on 17 3-pointers, led by Porzingis' five (one short of his career high).","401161403"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Denver Nuggets had seven healthy players to face the Utah Jazz and believed they had nothing to lose. Thanks to a noteworthy performance by Nikola Jokic, the tired Nuggets overcame significant obstacles and recorded an improbable 98-95 victory over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. ""We were believing and we didn't want to let this game go. We have excuses. We have seven guys . but we wanted to give ourselves a chance and give 100 percent of ourselves,"" said Jokic, who finished with 31 points, 21 rebounds and 10 assists. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Jokic is the 10th player with a 30-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist triple-double in NBA history and just the second in 35 years (joining DeMarcus Cousins) to achieve the statistical feat in a win. Jokic made 13 of this 14 field goal attempts with Rudy Gobert as his primary defender. ""Joker was amazing. He was playing cat-and-mouse with Gobert all game,"" Jamal Murray said. The Nuggets had such a short bench due to their part in a four-team, 12-player deal a day before the trade deadline and a cascade of injuries. ""This was our best win of the year,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. That showed as the players, including all the injured Nuggets, celebrated on the court after the final buzzer. Murray scored 31 points and the Nuggets held the Jazz to just one field goal over the final 7:08. ""Who gave us a chance to win this game? Nobody! It's a testament to the confidence we have, the courage that we have, the resiliency we have,"" Malone said. Mike Conley scored 21 points, but missed a floater with eight seconds left that would have given the Jazz the lead. Gary Harris, who missed all 13 of his field-goal attempts, made two free throws with 5.8 remaining for the final margin. ""It's hard to win games when you're not doing (good) things defensively. Offensively, we had too many turnovers and too many breakdowns,"" Conley said. Jokic posted his 11th triple-double of the season and fortunately for Denver, Murray was able to play two games in two nights, returning from an 11-game absence due to a sprained ankle. ""It hurts now, but it's easier when you're making shots,"" Murray said. Donovan Mitchell had 18 points on 8-for-24 shooting, Bojan Bogdanovic had 16 points and Gobert added 16 points and 14 rebounds for the Jazz, who lost their fifth straight game after winning 18 of 20. ""There's no way for us to be who we want to be and who we have been (and) lose this game,"" Mitchell said. The Jazz led 71-56 after Conley's fifth 3-pointer of the game before the weary Nuggets embarked on a 20-4 run, capped by Monte Morris' running jumper that gave Denver its first lead since the first quarter, 76-75. Jokic and Murray went to the bench to rest, and Jazz made their move and weren't stopped -- even when the Denver duo returned. The Jazz went on an 11-1 run, highlighted by a Clarkson-to-Mitchell alley-oop dunk. But Torrey Craig, who has harassed Mitchell into multiple subpar games, hit a 3-pointer and then blocked the Utah guard, leading to another layup as and the Nuggets closed within 92-89. Jokic hit a 17-footer that cut Utah's lead to 93-91. ""Nobody expected us to win so we just had that play free mentality,"" Murray said. ""We were tired, for sure, but we have been there before and we found a way to execute and get the shots we wanted and then got the stops we needed."" Last week, the Nuggets pulled off an unlikely sweep in back-to-back games, defeating Utah at home and Milwaukee on the road. They won back-to-back games again, beating the Jazz one night after a 127-99 rout of Portland on Tuesday. ""Before the break, this is the perfect time to steal some victories and this is the one we really wanted to steal,"" Jokic said. TRADE LAG The four-team, 12-player team deal involving Denver was approved by the NBA. Robert Covington is going to the Houston Rockets and Clint Capela is headed to the Atlanta Hawks. All told, it included 12 players and three draft picks. The Rockets got Covington and Jordan Bell from Minnesota, plus Golden State's 2024 second-round pick from the Hawks. Atlanta got two centers, Capela and Nene from Houston. Denver got Gerald Green from Houston along with the Rockets' 2020 first-round pick. The Nuggets also landed Keita Bates-Diop, Shabazz Napier and Noah Vonleh from Minnesota. Minnesota got Brooklyn's 2020 first-round pick and Evan Turner from Atlanta, plus Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt and Juancho Hernangomez from Denver. ""We're just trying to navigate those waters and try and get through this tough stretch,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""I have never been part of a game where you could potentially only have seven guys suiting up."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Besides the trade, the Nuggets have a long injury list: Will Barton (knee), Michael Porter Jr. (ankle), Jerami Grant (ankle), Paul Millsap (knee), Mason Plumlee (cuboid) and Bol Bol (foot). . Rookie Vlatko Cancar, who had never played more than three minutes in game, played 16 minutes and scored four points. . Gary Harris' 0-for-13 performance set a franchise record previously held by Ty Lawson and Paul Silas for the worst shooting nights without a field goal. Jazz: Utah had won nine consecutive home games against Denver. . Utah coach Quin Snyder challenged an offensive foul on Joe Ingles with 1:40 to play, but the call stood. ... Jordan Clarkson had 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting.","401161404"
"LOS ANGELES --  Once the Los Angeles Clippers figured out Miami's zone defense, their 3-point barrage was on. Paul George and Landry Shamet each scored 23 points to lead eight Clippers in double figures, and Los Angeles beat the Heat 128-111 on Wednesday night for its third consecutive victory. ""We were moving the ball against the zone, getting the right shots. We just weren't making shots,"" said Shamet, who was 1 of 7 in the first half. ""It all started to come together in the second half."" The Clippers made a franchise-record 24 3-pointers, their most since hitting 20 against Houston on Jan. 18, 2016. ""It was a deluge, avalanche in that second half of 3s and we just couldn't get a handle on it,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It was one of the better 3-point shooting displays I've been on the other end of. Probably the biggest one."" Jimmy Butler didn't play in the fourth quarter for Miami after straining his right shoulder. He'll have an MRI on Thursday. ""Just hope it ain't nothing major,"" he said. ""I want to be out there again on the wood with my guys."" Shamet's points were a season high and his most with the Clippers. He scored 14 off the bench in the fourth, pouring in 10 straight for Los Angeles. ""For whatever reason, out of all the firepower we have on the floor, they allow him to take the majority of the shots and he's made them pay both games,"" said teammate Lou Williams, who had 14 points. Kawhi Leonard added 14 points, nine assists and seven rebounds for the Clippers, who trailed by 12 in the first half before taking control over the final two periods. Shamet wasn't the only Los Angeles shooter to get hot in the fourth. JaMychal Green hit three 3-pointers, the last one extending the lead to 107-92. ""After the initial shock of the zone, we held them very well. We spaced the floor and we got great shots,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""At halftime they said, `Maybe we should drive more.' I said, `You're wide open, shoot them."" Derrick Jones Jr. paced six Heat players in double figures with a career-high 25 points and nine rebounds. Bam Adebayo added 22 points and 11 boards. The two of them combined to score all but six of Miami's 31 points in the fourth. Jones opened the fourth with a huge one-handed dunk, and Adebayo followed later with a jam of his own. The Heat closed within six just before Shamet scored the next 10 points for the Clippers. After that, George added a 3-pointer of his own to go with Shamet's long-range barrage. ""When they needed to keep us at bay they made two or three in a row, it seemed like at every sequence, to keep the distance,"" Spoelstra said. Miami tied the game for the last time on a basket by Kendrick Nunn early in the third. From there, the Clippers outscored the Heat 26-15, getting six 3s in a spurt that gave them a 92-80 lead going into the fourth. George scored eight straight points as part of the run. George had 10 of the Clippers' season-high 35 assists in his fourth game since missing nine with a left hamstring strain. The Heat opened a 12-point lead in the second quarter, bolstered by three 3-pointers from Gabe Vincent and eight points from Butler after he had just two in the first period. He finished with 11. The Clippers trailed 58-55 at halftime. TIP-INS Heat: Meyers Leonard was out of the starting lineup for the first time this season because of a left ankle sprain. ... Miami fell to 12-13 on the road and 3-7 against the West away from home. Clippers: Patrick Beverley left with a sore right groin and didn't return.

"NEW YORK --  The New York Knicks traded their leading scorer Thursday and fired their president two days earlier. During what should be a time of turbulence, they are playing some of their best basketball of the season. ""Everyone knows we have a job to do. We are still a team. We've still got to keep pushing,"" rookie RJ Barrett said. ""We've still got to play every day and do our jobs and we did that tonight."" And they left Orlando coach Steve Clifford screaming at the referees at halfcourt and criticizing them afterward for what he said was a lack of awareness in not granting him a timeout on the final possession. Julius Randle scored 22 points, Taj Gibson had 19 and the Knicks beat the Magic 105-103 for their third straight victory. Despite trading leading scorer Marcus Morris to the Clippers earlier in the day, the Knicks rallied from 10 down in the fourth quarter to match their longest winning streak of the season. ""They have been such a good group,"" interim coach Mike Miller said, ""the things that we have gone through as a team or the things that we have had individually and how they've been there for each other and how they've stuck together."" Elfrid Payton had 15 points, nine assists and seven steals for the Knicks, who got Barrett back after he missed nine games with a sprained right ankle. He finished with 12 points. Nikola Vucevic had 25 points and eight rebounds for the Magic, who lost for the seventh time in eight games. Clifford was trying desperately to get a timeout in the final seconds, but nobody on the court saw him and the Magic couldn't get a shot off. Clifford screamed at referees Tom Washington, Mitchell Ervin and Evan Scott after the game and had to be held back by Orlando assistant coaches. He said the officials should have been aware that the Magic, after rebounding a Knicks miss with about 10 seconds left, would likely push the ball in transition and try to call a timeout if that didn't work. ""There's three of them. There's a guy on the baseline and I just saw it. I mean, visibly I called timeout. I don't understand how that timeout's not called. That may cost me, I don't care,"" Clifford said. ""Like, again, when players don't have awareness, you lose. Coaches have poor awareness, that was my fault tonight, you lose. The officials got to have awareness, too. Knowing the rules and knowing the game, and knowing the situation's got to be part of it."" With the timeout not granted, Evan Fournier ended up losing the ball for Orlando's 21st turnover. The Knicks scored 30 points in the first quarter and had a 13-point lead in the second, but the Magic surged ahead by outscoring them 36-22 in the third. Orlando went ahead by 10 in the fourth quarter, but Wayne Ellington hit consecutive 3-pointers and added another later in the period. Payton's 3-pointer tied it before a jumper by Randle and Gibson's dunk gave New York a 100-96 edge with 3:49 to play. Randle hit another jumper to make it 105-98 with 1:44 to play and the Knicks held on despite not scoring again. TIP-INS Magic: The Magic acquired veteran forward James Ennis from the Philadelphia 76ers for a second-round pick in the 2020 draft. Clifford said Ennis would join the team Friday. Also, the Magic waived forward Amile Jefferson. ... Orlando had won seven of the last nine meetings. Knicks: Ellington and Reggie Bullock both had 12 points. MOVING MORRIS The Knicks received swingman Maurice Harkless and a 2020 first-round pick from the Clippers, and the draft rights to guard Issuf Sanon from Washington in the deal for Morris, who is fifth in the league in 3-point percentage. It gives the Knicks seven first-round selections in the next four years. PRESIDENTIAL PLANS The Knicks plan to hire agent Leon Rose to take over their basketball operations, a person with knowledge of the details said. Rose will replace Steve Mills, who was fired as team president on Tuesday, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing. Madison Square Garden executive chairman James Dolan said in a statement he hopes to wrap up his search for a new president quickly. ""I am not selling, but I am determined to find the right leader for the Knicks who will ensure the long-term success of the team, just as we did with the hiring of Rangers President John Davidson,"" Dolan said.","401161406"
"Stephen A. Smith argues that though Zion Williamson is turning into a star, the Pelicans need more pieces around him to win an NBA championship. (1:10) CHICAGO --  Zion Williamson saw the championship banners and could only imagine what the atmosphere was like when Michael Jordan was leading the Bulls to a pair of championship three-peats in the 1990s. Fair to say, it was a little louder. Williamson scored 21, JJ Redick added 18 points and the New Orleans Pelicans hung on to beat Chicago 125-119 on Thursday night. When I was here for shootaround ... I wondered what it was like when Jordan was playing here, Williamson said. Six finals, 6-0, that had to be something special. Williamson had nine points as New Orleans outscored Chicago 31-19 in the third quarter to break open the game. The Pelicans led by as many as 27 points and withstood a big run down the stretch by the Bulls' backups to come away with the win after back-to-back losses. Williamson didn't seem to be too bothered by a sprained right toe. The No. 1 overall draft pick made 9 of 11 shots, including a thunderous alley-oop early in the fourth quarter, after going 5 of 19 two nights earlier against the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks. Redick hit three 3-pointers, and All-Star Brandon Ingram added 15 points and five assists before leaving with a sprained right ankle in the third. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 22 points. Chandler Hutchison scored 16 points to go with eight rebounds, and Adam Mokoka added 15 in the fourth quarter -- the first points of his career. In his sixth NBA game, the rookie from Paris was even serenaded with MVP! MVP! chants in the closing minute as the Bulls whittled away the lead. They cut it to 123-119 with six seconds left on Ryan Arcidiacono's 3. But Jahlil Okafor tipped in a missed free throw by Jaxson Hayes to make it a six-point game. You know, the game was over in my book, LaVine said. I don't know what we were cheering for. I'm happy for Adam, but that game was over. We lost. STANDING PAT The trade deadline passed Thursday with the Bulls standing pat and insisting they remain committed to their young core despite a 19-33 record. Executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson said the team absolutely believes long term in LaVine and Lauri Markkanen. While LaVine came into Thursday's game averaging a career-high 24.9 points, Markkanen has taken a step back in his third season. Paxson insisted the Bulls still view the 7-footer from Finland as a cornerstone player and it's the organization's responsibility to help him become the player he wants to be. He said he talked to Markkanen's agent on Thursday and was given no indication he wants out of Chicago, though Paxson did acknowledge the Bulls need to give him a bigger role on offense. For now, Markkanen needs to heal after missing his seventh game in a row with a right hip injury. Paxson expects him, as well as Otto Porter Jr. (broken left foot) and Wendell Carter Jr. (sprained right ankle), to return at the end of the month or in early March. Paxson also said guard Denzel Valentine's name came up in trade talks, but Thaddeus Young's did not. JAMMING Hayes had a poster-worthy put-back dunk in the first quarter. He soared toward the rim and jammed in a missed 3 from the right wing by Redick, who bent over, clutched both his fists and wore a look of sheer awe. It seems like once or twice a game he does something that you're literally amazed by, Redick said. TIP-INS Pelicans: The Pelicans scored 72 points in the first half -- eight shy of a franchise record against the Los Angeles Clippers on Jan. 18. Bulls: G Kris Dunn (sprained right knee), Valentine (strained hamstring) and F Daniel Gafford (ankle) sat out the game.","401161407"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo believes the Milwaukee Bucks did the right thing by standing pat at the trade deadline. The reigning league MVP and his teammates kept rolling Thursday night. Antetokounmpo had 36 points and 20 rebounds in a 112-101 victory over the struggling Philadelphia 76ers. Milwaukee did not make a move at the deadline, preferring to stick with the team that has put up a league-best 44-7 record and is on pace to become the third team in league history to win 70 games. ""I think a lot of teams are getting players so they can play against us, so they can guard us better,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""But I think we're the best team in the NBA; we have the best record in the NBA. ""For me, I think there should not be any change. Thank God there wasn't. I think the guys we have, the chemistry we have on the team is amazing right now. The guys we have are playing great. These are the guys I've been going to war with all season and I'm happy we have the same team."" Milwaukee's swarming defense stymied the 76ers and their all-star center Joel Embiid. Philadelphia shot just 37.4% from the field (37 of 99) and Embiid was 6 of 26 while contributing 19 points and 11 rebounds in 33 minutes. ""Tonight I missed a lot of wide-open looks,"" said Embiid, who was 3 of 10 from 3-point distance. ""We came into the game with a plan of shooting a lot of 3s, especially with the way they guard us. I'm proud of my teammates. I felt tonight, compared to the previous games, we competed."" The Bucks won for the 12th time in 13 games, avenging a lopsided Christmas Day loss to the Sixers in Philadelphia. The Sixers closed out an 0-4 road swing that also included losses to Atlanta, Boston and Miami. Bucks forward Khris Middleton, limited to four points in the first half, finished with 20 points and seven rebounds, and point guard Eric Bledsoe added 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Tobias Harris led Philadelphia (31-21) with 25 points, and Ben Simmons narrowly missed a triple-double with 11 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists. ""I don't think they had much of the rhythm they wanted to,"" Middleton said. ""I think we did a great job playing physical and not fouling."" Antetokounmpo had 30-plus points and 15-plus rebounds for the fifth straight game and the 14th time this season. He became just the fifth player in franchise history to record a 30-20 game and the first since Vin Baker in Feb. 1996. He also became the first player in the NBA to have five straight 30-15 games since the 1985-86 season. ""It's crazy,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I'm happy that we're winning and we're playing good. But I can get a lot better. I can be smarter; I can be sharper. I can make better passes on time, make 3-point shots and 2-point shots. That's the mindset I have."" Center Brook Lopez was in early foul trouble for the Bucks, but twin brother Robin filled in with nine points in 20 minutes while effectively guarding Embiid. Milwaukee, ranked No. 1 in the league in defense, held an opponent to under 40% shooting for the 22nd time this season, a league high. ""The defense stood out to me tonight, both the activity and the length,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Both teams are long and athletic, but I think we controlled the paint and controlled the boards. If we can get to the 3-point line, maybe we could shut somebody out."" Milwaukee held the Sixers to 30 points in the paint and had a 60-50 rebounding advantage. Antetokounmpo had 19 points and 10 rebounds in the first half to help the Bucks to a 54-51 lead at intermission. Embiid was 1 for 10 from the field and had four points, while Harris led the Sixers with 12 points. The Bucks outscored the Sixers, 32-23, in the third quarter, helped by eight points each from Antetokounmpo and Middleton. Milwaukee led by as many a 17 points in the final quarter. TEAM GIANNIS Antetokounmpo and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James picked their respective teams for the All-Star Game in Chicago on Feb. 16. Team Giannis includes starters Embiid, Pascal Siakam, Kemba Walker, Trae Young and Antetokounmpo, while Team LeBron has a starting five with James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic and James Harden. Embiid was the Bucks star's opening pick. ""I think he's a cool guy, a great guy in the locker room,"" Antetokounmpo said. Antetokounmpo tabbed Bucks teammate Khris Middleton with his first reserve pick and added Bam Adebayo, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram and Donovan Mitchell. TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia acquired Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks from Golden State in a trade deadline deal on Thursday, a move made to bolster the team's bench. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown was happy with the additions. ""In Alec, you get somebody that can make plays all by himself and can get to the rim,"" Brown said. ""And Glenn, kind of the two-way player who can make shots and is growing his defense."" The Sixers also traded James Ennis to Orlando for a 2020 second-round pick to clear one roster spot and waived Trey Burke to clear another. . The Sixers have struggled on the road, going 9-19 while putting a 22-2 record together at home. ""In general, there is a mental toughness that you need to have on the road,"" Brown said. ""At times, we haven't had it to the volume and intensity that we need."" Bucks: Milwaukee remains on pace to become the third NBA team to win 70 games, which would put the franchise in elite company with the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (72 wins) and 2015-16 Golden State Warriors (73 wins). Budenholzer has downplayed the 70-victory talk but co-owner Marc Lasry said recently he thinks the Bucks can join that club and win a championship. Asked about it in the pregame session, the Bucks coach said it has not been a topic in the locker room. . The Bucks stood pat at the trade deadline while Eastern Conference contender Miami made a key move to land former Warriors super-sub Andre Iguodala. ""I feel really great about our team,"" Budenholzer said. ""We've been even better for the first 50 games than we were last year. The continuity means a lot to us.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  With the trade deadline past and a playoff race ahead, the Portland Trail Blazers understood the importance of their game against the San Antonio Spurs. Damian Lillard had 26 points and 10 assists, Hassan Whiteside scored 17 points and tied a season-high with 23 rebounds as the Trail Blazers beat San Antonio 125-117, taking two of three games from the Spurs to claim the season series in matchup with playoff tiebreaker potential. The Blazers are 2 1/2 games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the 8th and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Spurs are 4 1/2 games back of Memphis. ""We talked about it,"" Lillard said of his team's mindset heading into the game. ""I think we past the point of saying `it's just another game.' ... Every game is important, but games like this are more important because they are one of the teams that we're fighting for that spot with. It was a tiebreaker game, we're not playing them no more after this. It also gives us some separation from them. They lost two coming in here and it would be good for us to give them a third. We got the game ahead of them and we got the tiebreaker, so it was a huge game."" The Blazers got a major boost off their bench from Gary Trent Jr., who scored 18 points. Trent's points late were important as he hit four 3-pointers and scored 12 points in the fourth quarter as Portland rallied from a 92-86 deficit. Trent, Lillard says, is giving the Blazers something they need. ""I think he's giving us something to be excited about,"" Lillard said. ""He's been consistent. How he's playing on the defensive end, how he's getting to his spots to be effective and making shots. He's somebody that has to be accounted for, especially on a night like tonight, he came up big for us."" Trent, who barely played as a rookie, has been getting consistent minutes and is shooting nearly 42% from he 3-point line on four attempts per game. ""It's like you belong. I work on everything with my coaches every day, it's just paying off,"" Trent said. Trey Lyles had a season-high 23 points and 10 rebounds, DeMar DeRozan added 21 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points and eight rebounds for the Spurs. San Antonio built a 10-point lead multiple times in the first half, but Portland stayed within reach on the strength of the play of Lillard (14 points) and McCollum (11 points), trailing 60-59 at halftime. While DeRozan struggled from the field (6 for 16), he helped the Spurs with 9-for-9 shooting from the foul line. A pair of 3-pointers in the third quarter by Carmelo Anthony forced a timeout by the Spurs with 5:23 left in the third as they nursed a 75-74 lead. Anthony' kept Portland close, scoring 16 of his 20 points in the second half. The Blazers also got a 10-point performance off the bench by Anfernee Simons. While Portland had plenty of contributions, Spurs Gregg Popovich says Portland's success started with Lillard. ""It was a good game, until Damian broke it open with his basketball play,"" Popovich said. ""I mean, you know, he got through the double teams and split pick and rolls and found his teammates and they knocked down shots."" A layup by Caleb Swanigan with 3:16 left in the third quarter gave Portland its first lead since the opening quarter. But that advantage was short-lived as the Spurs closed out the quarter on a 9-0 run for a 92-86 lead after three periods. TIP-INS Spurs: Thursday's loss was the third straight for the Spurs, but Lyles having a big night was a bright spot for San Antonio. ""It took me a little bit while longer than I expected to get comfortable (in San Antonio),"" Lyles said. The forward, who is on his third team, isn't trying to do anything out of the ordinary. ""I just continue to be myself, not settle, just find my niche where I could help impact on the court."" Trail Blazers: During an active NBA trade deadline, the Blazers made a small move to help save money in luxury tax payments by trading Skal Labissiere and cash considerations to the Atlanta Hawks. Labissiere has been out since Dec. 28. ""I'm going to miss Skal,"" coach Terry Stotts said of Labissiere. ""I was happy for him that he showed he could help an NBA team. And I was disappointed he got hurt. Hopefully he can rehab with Atlanta and continue his career."" The move helped Portland avoid approximately $5 million in luxury tax payments.","401161409"
"LOS ANGELES --  Nobody taller than 6-foot-6 was in Houston's starting lineup, and a heavily bearded guard lost the opening tip. Nobody bigger than 6-foot-7 Robert Covington played for the Rockets in a game between division leaders at Staples Center. Because Russell Westbrook went wild and Covington came up big late in his debut, the Rockets' first experiment in extremely small ball was a large success -- and the hulking Los Angeles Lakers came up short. Westbrook scored 41 points and Covington hit two clutch late 3-pointers while getting 14 points and eight rebounds, leading Houston to a 121-111 win over Los Angeles on Thursday night. James Harden managed just 14 points, but Westbrook picked up the scoring slack before Covington had several big moments down the stretch. The final surge sent the Rockets to a major road win in their first attempt at playing without a center in coach Mike D'Antoni's latest brainstorm. ""Every time you try something different, these guys have got to believe in it,"" D'Antoni said. ""And this helps a lot, because if you come in here and get spanked and they're all little, it's like, `Oh, maybe we can't do this.' So they're fired up to keep trying. It's just one game, but the confidence is good."" Anthony Davis and the Lakers capitalized inside on the Rockets' diminutive defenders, but Houston still rallied from a late four-point deficit and ended the game on a 19-5 surge highlighted by two of Covington's four 3-pointers. The veteran was acquired from Minnesota on Wednesday in a four-team trade, and he tried to adjust quickly to being the tallest player on the floor for his new squad. ""Means a lot, just being able to come in and make a major impact,"" Covington said. ""It just shows that my coaches and my teammates believe in me."" Davis had 32 points and 13 rebounds, and LeBron James had 18 points, 15 assists and nine rebounds in a meeting of first-place teams with sharply contrasting approaches. The Lakers didn't blame the loss on the Rockets' unusual lineup, but instead on their lack of execution in several key stretches. ""You've just got to communicate,"" James said. ""James is getting a lot of eyes on him, but Russ was doing what he is definitely capable of doing. He was wonderful tonight."" Harden took just 10 shots in his follow-up to back-to-back 40-point games, but Westbrook returned from a one-game absence with a sprained thumb and had a huge performance in the Rockets' fourth straight win. Although Davis, Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee had a relatively easy time getting shots down low and grabbing rebounds in traffic, the Rockets' small lineup created the offensive spacing and ball movement desired above all else by D'Antoni. ""They hit some tough shots down the stretch, and we made some costly turnovers at the end,"" Davis said. The Lakers got plenty of simple baskets down low, but the Rockets went 15 for 29 on 3-pointers in the first three quarters to keep it close. Covington came up with a key block of Davis' shot with about 3:30 to play after Houston reclaimed the lead, and he hit a clutch 3-pointer from the corner with 2:42 to play. TIP-INS Rockets: They avenged a 124-115 loss to the Lakers in Houston last month. Davis sat out of that game with an injury. ... Bruno Caboclo wasn't available a few hours after Houston acquired the Brazilian shooter from Memphis in a trade for Jordan Bell. Lakers: Davis went to the locker room shortly before halftime. He sprained his right index finger, but returned to start the second half with a wrap on his hand. ... LA didn't make a trade near the deadline for the first time since 2016. ... James got fans on their feet with a double-pump, two-handed reverse dunk when he got out alone on a break in the third quarter. COLLISON'S VIEW The Lakers stood pat at the trade deadline, preferring to stick with the roster that has spent nearly five months building the chemistry necessary to post the Western Conference's best record. They might not be done adding to the roster, however: Darren Collison watched the game next to Lakers owner Jeanie Buss in the second half. The Rancho Cucamonga native and UCLA product is reportedly weighing an NBA return after retiring from his 10-year career in June. ""I'm never one to talk fantasy basketball,"" James said when asked about Collison's potential fit in LA. ""We'll see what happens."" RUSS MILESTONE Westbrook scored his 20,000th career point during the game in his hometown. He joined James and Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history with 20,000 points, 7,000 assists, 6,000 rebounds. ""That's a blessing,"" Westbrook said. ""I'm thankful for being healthy. Thankful for having so many great teammates."" LET'S GET SMALL Houston gave up big man Clint Capela to acquire Covington, leaving the club with an uncommonly small roster even by the Rockets' standards. They still have 7-footers Tyson Chandler and Isaiah Hartenstein on the roster, but neither got playing time at Staples Center while D'Antoni used only nine players. Danuel House Jr., who is listed at 6-foot-6, was the Rockets' starter. P.J. Tucker, who is 6-foot-5, occupied the nominal center spot and attempted to guard the Lakers' big men, but immediately got into foul trouble. The Lakers adapted their own lineups, with Howard and McGee playing only a combined 20 minutes.","401161410"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The 76ers needed to get back to their home court to get back on track. Furkan Korkmazs shooting helped, too. Korkmaz scored a career-high 34 points, Ben Simmons added 22 points and 10 assists and Philadelphia snapped a four-game losing streak with a 119-107 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. We needed this, Simmons said. Joel Embiid didnt come out after halftime due to a stiff neck. He finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds in 16 minutes for the 76ers, who improved to an NBA-best 23-2 at home. Korkmaz made 13 of 17 shots, including 7 of 9 3-pointers. It was a tough week, Korkmaz said. Everybody brought their spirit, everybody helped each other and everybody looked good on the court. The 76ers were glad to be back in Philadelphia after a dismal four-game road trip that saw them get outscored by 73 total points while allowing an average of 123 points per contest in defeats to Atlanta, Boston, Miami and Milwaukee. Those losses dropped the 76ers road record to 9-19. The latest road defeat, Thursdays 112-101 setback at Milwaukee, came after a players-only meeting following Mondays 137-106 blowout at Miami. Ja Morant had 15 points to pace Memphis, which lost for just the fourth time in 17 games. The Grizzlies, who last made the playoffs in 2017, entered 3 games ahead of Portland for the final postseason berth in the Western Conference. They just executed at a really high level and imposed their will, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Getting to the playoffs was considered an afterthought for the 76ers, who began the season as title contenders. But Philadelphia was the No. 6 seed if the playoffs started Friday. The 76ers were out of sync offensively during their skid, and coach Brett Brown has been trying to mesh All-Stars Simmons and Embiid without success of late. Its a good problem to have  if its a problem, 76ers GM Elton Brand said prior to the game. Brand made some moves this week to help Brown. Philadelphia acquired some outside shooting and bench production with the additions of Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks from Golden State for three second-round picks. Neither was available for Fridays game, and their first appearance could come in Sundays home contest against Chicago. Robinson and Burks were added for their outside shooting, something Korkmaz provided in a strong first half for Philadelphia. Korkmaz had 20 points while making 8 of 9 shots, including 4 of 5 3-pointers, to help the 76ers take a 58-44 lead at the break. Simmons added 16 points and helped Philadelphia pull away late in the second quarter with five points in the final 40.9 seconds, including a pair of free throws after getting fouled following a steal of an unsuspecting Morant at midcourt. Even without Embiid, it was all 76ers after the intermission. Simmons fed Matisse Thybulle for a dunk that gave Philadelphia its largest lead to that point, 74-51 with 7:28 left in the third quarter. And then Simmons stripped Kyle Anderson following a timeout, finishing with a two-handed jam that put Philadelphia up 25 points. The lead eventually grew to 33 points. COMING SOON The Grizzlies also were without their newly acquired players. Neither Jordan Bell, Justise Winslow, Gorgui Deng nor Dion Waiters suited up. Jenkins said prior to the game he is looking forward to getting the new players into the fold. Theyre just going to enhance what were building here, he said. Im very excited about the new guys coming in. Im excited to get them in the fold and get them up to speed in what were doing. BRAND BACKS BROWN Brand gave his support to Brown prior to the contest. I believe in Bretts ability to lead this team, Brand said. Brown has come under fire of late for the 76ers struggles, particularly on the road. We have to fix that, Brand said. We can do it and will do it. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Grayson Allen (hip) missed his seventh straight contest.  Jenkins, a Penn graduate, stopped by his alma mater to talk to a student group and visited his favorite cheesesteak spot. 76ers: Josh Richardson returned to the court after sitting out five games due to a hamstring injury. He had four points in 15 minutes.  Philadelphia waived Jonah Bolden and signed Norvel Pelle. Pelle played in 14 games this season. He scored five points.","401161411"
"WASHINGTON --  Bradley Beal's last-second layup handed the Dallas Mavericks another loss without Luka Doncic. They felt as though things slipped away well before that. Beal made a layup with 0.2 seconds left to finish with 29 points and give the Washington Wizards a 119-118 victory Friday night over Dallas, which has dropped three of five since Doncic went out with a sprained right ankle. The Mavericks committed 14 turnovers that turned into 23 Wizards points, and they weren't themselves defensively in part because Kristaps Porzingis got into foul trouble. ""The game was lost throughout,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We had too many miscommunications, and it was a collection of defensive mistakes over 47 minutes and 58.2 seconds or whatever it was that led to this. Just very disappointing."" Beal's heroics came after Mavericks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. drew a blocking foul and hit one of two free throws with 1.8 seconds left. ""He was reading the defense really well and it's a great play, good screen, good finish,"" coach Scott Brooks said. Beal fell one point short of reaching 30 for an eighth consecutive game, but felt great about getting the 18-32 Wizards to the edge of a playoff position in the Eastern Conference. They're three games back of the eighth seed. ""It just meant a lot to win at the end of the day,"" said Beal, who was 11 of 28 from the field. ""We've got four or five home games before the break. We can take full advantage of that and be sitting right in the playoff picture."" Washington made 19 of 38 3-pointers. Davis Bertans was responsible for five of them and finished with 20 points. ""We've just got to do a better job guarding guys,"" Mavericks forward Dorian Finney-Smith said. ""We've got to limit the wide-open 3s."" Rookie Rui Hachimura took it to Porzingis, getting the Mavericks center into foul trouble and finishing with 17. Porzingis, who played without a protective face mask two nights after breaking his nose, picked up his fifth early in the fourth quarter and had 11 points in just 21:16. Shuffling Porzingis in and out didn't help the Mavericks' rhythm, especially on defense, where players blamed a lack of communication. ""This team is way too close to not talk as much as we did tonight,"" Jalen Brunson said. ""We have very good chemistry, we all enjoy each other, so this is a very uncharacteristic night for us not talking defensively."" DONCIC UPDATE Doncic is progressing in his rehab, and the Mavericks hope he can play at least one game before the All-Star break, which begins for them after a game against Sacramento on Feb. 12. This is the second time Doncic sprained his right ankle this season, and it's unclear what kind of maintenance it'll need over the next few weeks and months. ""Any time you have any body part that's been injured a couple times, the training staff's going to watch it very closely,"" Carlisle said. STAYING PAT Unlike previous years, Dallas made no moves at Thursday's NBA trade deadline. That didn't surprise Carlisle. ""We like the roster,"" he said. ""We've liked it from the beginning of the year. The important thing now is to work on our health going into the break."" The Wizards acquired 2018 first-round pick Jerome Robinson and fellow guard Shabazz Napier in a pair of deals in which they sent Isaiah Thomas to the Clippers and Jordan McRae to the Nuggets. Napier played against the Mavericks, while Robinson is expected to make his Washington debut Sunday. ""It was two great moves for us going forward,"" Brooks said. ""They're both going to get good opportunities to see where they are as players and hopefully we can develop them as the rest of the season comes along."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Seth Curry returned after missing two games with left knee tightness and led Dallas with 20 points off the bench. ... G Jose Juan Berea missed a second consecutive game with a sprained left ankle. ... The Mavericks had seven players in double figures. Wizards: Bertans passed Gilbert Arenas for the most 3-pointers in team history through the first 50 games of a season. ... Napier scored 14 points in his Wizards debut.","401161412"
"BOSTON --  As well as the Celtics have played lately, guard Marcus Smart believes they can play even better. Jayson Tatum had seven 3-pointers and scored 32 points to help Boston sneak out of TD Garden with a 112-107 win over struggling Atlanta on Friday night. But with eight of the Celtics' next nine against teams currently in playoff contention, Smart knows there won't be any room for lapses over the next few weeks. That's something as a team we're still learning and we're still getting better at, Smart said. We've got to play to the final buzzer. That's what's gonna make us a great team. We still have a lot to learn. But I like they way we did tonight. It was Tatum's eighth consecutive game with at least 20 points. Enes Kanter added 16 points and 15 rebounds. Romeo Langford chipped in 16 points off the bench as Boston posted its sixth consecutive win. Atlanta led at halftime, despite having only nine players available and playing without Trae Young, DeAndrew Bembry, Cam Reddish and Bruno Fernando. But the Hawks struggled to make shots in the second half. They got within 110-107 with 41.3 seconds to play on a dunk by John Collins. The Hawks got the ball back with 18.3 seconds left, but Kevin Huerter and Brandon Goodwin both came up empty from 3. Langford corralled the rebound, was fouled and hit both of his ensuing free throws. I was a lot more comfortable,"" said Langford, who at times found himself guarding Vince Carter just a game removed from making his first career start. ""It took me a little bit to get the rhythm of the game, but once I got running up and down the court a little bit, I felt like I belonged out there. Collins led Atlanta with 30 points and 10 rebounds. Huerter finished with 25 points. The Hawks kept the game close despite also not having trade deadline acquisitions Clint Capela, Dewayne Dedmon and Skal Labissiere, who hadn't yet joined the team as they awaited their deals to be officially completed. We've just got to play with effort, no matter if we're short-handed or not, Huerter said. It's the kind of thing you've got to do to piece games together. ... Hopefully Sunday we can get more people on the court."" The Celtics were also missing starters with Jaylen Brown (right ankle sprain), Gordon Hayward (left foot soreness) and Daniel Theis (right ankle sprain) all sitting out. Boston took advantage of the holes in Atlanta's lineup, jumping out to a 21-7 lead, which included 17 combined points by Tatum and Walker. But Boston's second unit of Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Vincent Poirier, Brad Wannamaker and Tremont Waters shot just 1 of 8 from the field over the final 6:46 of the opening quarter. Atlanta finished the period trailing 28-26, getting 11 points from Collins and 10 from Huerter. The Hawks outscored the Celtics 29-26 in the second quarter and took a 55-54 lead into halftime. The Celtics responded, outscoring Atlanta 22-11 over the final 7:29 of the third quarter to take an 87-73 lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Hawks: Fell to an Eastern Conference-worse 6-22 on the road with loss. ... Shot just 6 for 21 from the field (five turnovers) in the third quarter. Celtics: Improved to 35-9 when scoring 100 or more points. HONORING CARTER Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge presented Carter with a plaque prior to the game congratulating him on his 22 season Hall of Fame career. The plaque included a photo of Carter -- then with the Raptors -- shooting a jumper over Paul Pierce. It also included logos of the eight NBA teams the 43-year-old Carter has played for during his career. Later, Celtics fans erupted in cheers when he checked into the game midway through the first quarter.","401161413"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Toronto coach Nick Nurse keeps imploring the defending NBA champions to fix their flaws. The bigger challenge, right now, might be identifying those errors. Two days after rallying from a 19-point deficit to extend their franchise-record winning streak, the short-handed Raptors used another late charge to pull away from Indiana 115-106 on Friday night for their 13th consecutive victory. ""I thought we were into it the whole 48 minutes,"" Nurse said. ""I thought we were playing well enough to maybe get away. You know how those games come down to somebody hits a couple at one end, somebody misses a couple at the other and all of a sudden the game's over."" Lately, the Raptors seem to have had all the answers. They've won without Marc Gasol and Norman Powell, two key players who are injured. They won Wednesday when it looked as though they didn't have a chance. And this time, they delivered the decisive final flurry without six-time All-Star Kyle Lowry. Lowry missed the final 14 1/2 minutes with what Nurse described as a whiplash injury. And yet, the Raptors still managed to beat the Pacers for the second time in three days, win their first game in Indianapolis in 13 months and head home with their 10th consecutive road victory. ""We just won the previous game when they were up, just like this,"" Terence Davis II said after scoring 17. ""We didn't want to make the same mistake."" Instead, Serge Ibaka scored 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to help the Raptors keep their perfect mark intact for at least one more day. Fred VanVleet added 20 points and seven assists for Toronto, which hasn't lost since Jan. 15. For the Pacers, it was another excruciating loss. Domantas Sabonis finished with 19 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Pacers, and Victor Oladipo added 15 points and four assists in his first home start since returning from an injured right knee. Indiana has lost a season-high four in a row, three of those coming on their home court. ""Once again, they just killed us in transition with 27 fast-break points,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""We've just got to do a better job taking care of the ball, a better job executing our offense and really playing both sides of the basketball."" Toronto finally broke it open late in the third quarter when they turned a 12-3 run into an 87-78 lead. But when Lowry left with 2:42 to go, the Pacers closed out the quarter with five straight points, cutting the deficit to four. The Pacers got as close as 101-99 with 6:47 left before Davis scored seven points in a 12-4 spurt that gave Toronto an insurmountable 113-103 lead with 1:48 to go. TIP-INS Raptors: Pascal Siakam scored 15 points despite hurting his eye. ... OG Anunoby scored 16 points and had five steals before fouling out. The Raptors are 20-4 when Anunoby scores in double figures. ... VanVleet also finished with two steals, his 21st game this season with more than one. ... The Raptors made seven 3-pointers in the first quarter and wound up 17 of 38 from beyond the arc. Pacers: Malcolm Brogdon had 16 points and eight assists, while T.J. McConnell and Justin Holiday each scored 12. McConnell also had seven assists. ... Jeremy Lamb finished with 11 points. ... Sabonis had 10 points and 10 rebounds at halftime, his 39th double-double this season. ... T.J. Warren missed the game because he had not cleared the concussion protocol. LOWRY UPDATE Lowry finished with 16 points and 11 assists in 28 minutes but did not return after colliding with Ibaka. Replays appeared to show Lowry's head making contact near Ibaka's hip as he fell to the floor after drawing a foul. Lowry remained down on the court for several minutes as teammates gathered round. Eventually, he got up and walked to the bench before heading to the locker room. He did not talk to reporters following the game, though he complained of soreness in his neck and right shoulder and moved stiffly around the locker room. Nurse said he didn't expect Lowry to play Saturday night. ROUNDING INTO SHAPE Oladipo seems to be reverting to form after finishing with 15 points, four assists and two steals in 27 1/2 minutes. His 5-of-11 shooting was a welcome improvement over the 24.5% mark he had coming into the game but what upset him the most was committing four of Indiana's 20 turnovers. ""In the first half, we did a great job sharing the ball and playing defense,"" he said. ""In the second half, we turned the ball over a little too much and they responded off our turnovers.""","401161414"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Nothing changed for the Oklahoma City Thunder before the trade deadline. As a result, nothing appears to have changed after -- in their first game since, they won again with balanced scoring and solid defense. Chris Paul scored 22 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 21 to help the Thunder beat the Detroit Pistons 108-101 on Friday night. Danilo Gallinari scored 19 points, Dennis Schroder 18 and Steven Adams 16 for Oklahoma City, which has won nine of 10. Most of the hype before the deadline involved Gallinari, the team's No. 2 scorer. Paul was happy that the Thunder were able to keep their team together. ""It's always uncertainty because it's a whole ordeal now with the deadline,"" he said. ""It shows. It's a frenzy. It's good to know that we're going to keep playing together."" Oklahoma City is now 12 games above .500. ""It's us,"" Paul said. ""Once the deadline passes, I don't care what they said -- this, that was going to happen. We're going to make a run at this thing, and we've got our group."" Former Thunder guard Reggie Jackson scored a season-high 28 points for Detroit. Christian Wood scored 27 points and Thon Maker added a season-high 19 for the Pistons. It was Detroit's first game since trading Andre Drummond to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Drummond is a two-time All-Star who leads the league with 15.8 rebounds per game. Detroit coach Dwane Casey said before the game that the move was strictly business. ""Andre is a fabulous basketball player in our league,"" he said. ""Everybody makes a big thing about big guys. Still big guys -- as long as that basket's 10 feet, big guys are still going to be important."" Detroit's leading scorer, Derrick Rose, sat out with a strained left hip. With the trade and injuries, Casey had just nine available players. Oklahoma City shot 54.3% in the first half to lead 52-47 at the break. Late in the third quarter, Gilgeous-Alexander got the roll on a pull-up jumper and was fouled. He missed the free throw, but got the rebound and made a layup to put the Thunder ahead 74-63. The Thunder led 78-68 at the end of the third quarter, then Jackson scored seven points in the first two minutes of the fourth quarter to cut Oklahoma City's lead to 85-78. Detroit cut its deficit to four in the closing minutes, but Paul made two free throws and a jumper to give the Thunder a 103-95 lead with 1:31 to play, creating enough of a cushion for Oklahoma City to hold on. Casey said part of the problem late was that he utilized so many young players. ""I thought we didn't do a great job of executing down the stretch,"" Casey said. ""Some of that -- a lot of guys hadn't been in those situations. But again, the effort and the intensity, I thought was there for the most part of the game."" TIP-INS Pistons: Had six players listed as out with injuries and five players listed as inactive. The inactives included John Henson and Brandon Knight, the players Detroit got back from the Drummond deal. ... Maker fouled out in the fourth quarter. ... Jackson scored 15 points on 5-for-6 shooting in the fourth quarter. Thunder: G Terrance Ferguson played in his second game since returning from an eight-game personal absence.

According to the Thunder, the only Oklahoma City players ever to post longer streaks are all at least 6-10: Nerlens Noel, Kendrick Perkins and Serge Ibaka.

"PHOENIX --  Kelly Oubre Jr. was one of many Phoenix Suns players who had their names floated in trade rumors over the past week. But the trade deadline came and went, nobody was moved, and by Friday morning's shootaround there was a mini-celebration that everyone was still around. ""The first thing we said when we saw each other this morning was `We made it!"" Oubre said. The good vibes continued several hours later when the Suns played one of their best games of the season in a 127-91 victory over the Houston Rockets. Oubre scored a career-high 39 points and Devin Booker added 33. ""I don't want to get too high on the hog, but I thought that was a really good effort from our guys,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""There was a sense of urgency from the tip to play with great effort. That was pleasing for me."" The Suns poured in 46 points in the first quarter and led the rest of the way, turning back a handful of Houston rallies. The Rockets were playing without All-Star guard Russell Westbrook, who was held out for rest one night after Houston beat the Los Angeles Lakers. The 24-year-old Oubre had a stellar game on his bobblehead night, hitting a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Suns a 97-73 lead going into the fourth quarter. He shot 14 of 19 from the field, including 7 of 9 from 3-point range. ""My teammates were passing me the ball,"" Oubre said. ""I was just playing within the coach's system, being in attack mode, staying aggressive. I'm honored, but we've got another one tomorrow."" The Suns snapped a four-game losing streak overall and a 13-game losing streak against the Rockets that dates to 2016. James Harden led the Rockets with 32 points despite not playing in the fourth quarter because the Suns were well ahead. He finished 9 of 19 from the field and made five 3-pointers. ""They played better than we did,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Their athleticism, their freshness just overwhelmed us and we were dead-legged, couldn't make threes. Just all kinds of little things."" The Suns jumped out to a 46-26 lead by the end of the first quarter, shooting 17 of 20 from the field, including 8 of 10 from 3-point range. Booker scored 18 points and Oubre had 10. Houston bounced back in the second quarter, cutting the deficit to 65-55 by halftime. Harden scored 25 points in the first half, including 16 in the second quarter. The Rockets cut the Suns' lead to 65-59 early in the third quarter, but couldn't get any closer. ""In games like this you've got to jump on teams. It was kind of going back and forth and they kind of blitzed us,"" Harden said. ""We tried to fight our way back. It was just too much."" The Suns shot 56% from the field for the game, including 15 of 31 (48%) on 3-pointers. Phoenix improved to 21-31 for the season while Houston fell to 33-19. SMALL BALL SPUTTERS The Rockets have had some success over the past week with abnormally small lineups, including one game where nobody listed over 6-foot-6 played. The undersized approach didn't work against the Suns. Houston went small again against Phoenix, though the Rockets did start the recently-acquired 6-foot-8 Robert Covington. The Suns won the rebound battle 51-29 and had a 50-36 advantage on points in the paint. TIP-INS Rockets: Westbrook didn't play one night after scoring 41 points against the Lakers on 17-of-28 shooting from the field. ... Houston shot just 34% from the field against the Suns, including 11 of 48 (23%) on 3-pointers.

Rookie forward Cameron Johnson played on Friday after missing 10 games with a right quad contusion. ... Booker scored his 33 points in just 29 minutes.","401161416"
"Andre Iguodala explains how he spent his time off and how he feels he can help a young Miami Heat team. (2:26) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 23 points, Buddy Hield added 21 and the Sacramento Kings used 19 3-pointers to beat the Miami Heat 105-97 on Friday night. De'Aaron Fox had 16 points and eight assists as the Kings won their fifth in seventh games. Nemanja Bjelica added 15 points and eight assists. Eight days after setting a franchise record with 21 3-pointers, Sacramento nearly matched it while going 19 of 42 beyond the arc. Bogdanovic had six 3s, and Hield and Bjelica had five apiece. Bam Adebayo had 26 points and seven rebounds for Miami. Duncan Robinson added 18 points, six assists and five rebounds. The Heat played short-handed, although it won't be for long. All-Star Jimmy Butler did not play after straining his right shoulder in a loss to the Clippers on Wednesday, but got good news after an MRI test on his shoulder came back negative. Newcomers Andre Iguodala, Solomon Hill and Jae Crowder -- acquired in a trade from Memphis earlier this week -- were also held out. Sacramento took advantage and earned a split of the season series with Miami. The Kings trailed midway through the third quarter, then took over. Harry Giles scored on a putback, followed by consecutive 3s from Bjelica and Bogdanovic. Hield later added a 3-pointer and Fox made a steal near midcourt and went in for an easy layup. Sacramento went on another big run in the fourth and led by 17.

Iguodala, 36, last played June 13, 2019, in the playoffs for Golden State but says he feels great after the time away. A two-year, $30 million extension from the Heat didn't hurt, either. ""I still feel like I have a lot of time left and I think it'll show,"" he said said. ""I'm sure I can get out there right now but I want to be in a position where I'm not being a hindrance. I want to be a plus and a positive every step of the way."" TIP-INS Heat: Derrick Jones Jr. had nine points and six rebounds while starting in place of Butler. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  One play punctuated a thrilling comeback for the Utah Jazz. However, it was a play that ultimately should not have counted. Utah's Donovan Mitchell scored a go-ahead layup with 19.5 seconds left. Portland's Damian Lillard tried to answer with a layup on the other end, but Rudy Gobert blocked the shot with 11.2 seconds left. The Jazz snapped a five-game losing streak and beat Trail Blazers 117-114 on Friday night. The only problem? Gobert committed goaltending by blocking the shot off the glass. But, the referee crew made no call on the play. ""We get to the last play of the game and they miss a easy call,"" Lillard said. ""Then they tell us it's a easy no call, like that's obviously not a goaltend. It cost us the (expletive) game, man."" NBA referee Josh Tiven confirmed to a pool reporter after the game that video review showed that a goaltending violation should have been called originally, but it was not a reviewable play because the crew did not call it on the floor. That was little consolation for the Trail Blazers. Instead of tying the game, and potentially forcing overtime, Portland came away with a costly defeat amid a push to get back into the playoff picture. ""It cost us the game. We can't get it back,"" C.J. McCollum said. ""When we make mistakes, we're fined. And they cost us a game that could cost people money, so, they should be fined accordingly, because that's terrible. Not just bad, terrible."" Gobert said he was trying to make a play on the ball and felt like the no-call overshadowed a memorable Utah comeback from a 14-point halftime deficit. ""Obviously it's a big play because it's the last play and it's what everyone is going to remember,"" Gobert said. ""But I think we did a great job playing in the second half. Mistakes are made. Officials are human. I feel like it's all part of the game."" Bojan Bogdanovic had 27 points to lead Utah. Mike Conley added 18 points for the Jazz. Mitchell and Gobert (14 rebounds) chipped in 16 points apiece. Lillard finished with 42 points for Portland. McCollum scored 27 points, Gary Trent added 16 and Mario Hezonja 11 for the Blazers, which had only seven healthy players available for the bulk of the final three quarters. Trailing by 13 points early in the third, the Jazz used a 20-6 run to erase Portland's lead. Ingles punctuated the run with a 3-pointer, putting Utah up 86-85. The Jazz extended their lead to 106-99 on a 3-pointer by Bogdanovic, before the Blazers rallied. Lillard tied it at 114-all on back-to-back baskets in the final minute. ""Our guys came out and dug in and did what we needed to do on the defensive end,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. The Blazers shot 75% (15 of 20) in the first quarter. Lillard served as a catalyst for the blistering start. Stopping the Lillard proved to be a chore for the Jazz from the opening tip. Lillard started 7 of 7 from the floor and did not miss his first shot until midway through the second quarter. He scored 16 points in the first quarter alone. Lillard's first four baskets came from the perimeter and helped Portland race to a 21-12 lead. Utah used a 17-4 run to surge ahead early in the second quarter. Conley beat the first quarter buzzer with a 3-pointer to fuel the run and Ingles capped it with another outside basket to give the Jazz a 44-41 lead. Portland regained its footing on offense and used a 14-2 run to build a 72-58 halftime lead. Lillard and Gary Trent, Jr. scored back-to-back layups off steals to fuel the spurt. ""I was really proud of our guys,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""Obviously we're short-handed, it was an outstanding effort by everyone who played, and it's just a shame that it was decided on an inexcusable missed call."" GETTING CHIPPY Utah and Portland combined for six technical fouls in the second quarter. Trevor Ariza got ejected with 10:05 left in the second quarter after earning two technical fouls when he verbally accosted a referee. Then, Carmelo Anthony, Royce O'Neale, Mitchell, and Trent earned single technicals before the quarter ended. POUNDING THE PAINT The Jazz finished with 66 points in the paint, their second-highest total of the season. Utah outscored Portland 36-16 in the paint after halftime and got 75% of its second-half baskets in the paint. ""Just being able to get in the paint allowed us to get a little more ball movement,"" Conley said. ""We really tried to be aggressive and not just settle too much."" TIP INS Blazers: Hassan Whiteside (left leg contusion) did not play. . Anfernee Simons did not return after suffering a concussion with 20.7 seconds left in the first quarter.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  A slow start didn't help Giannis Antetokounmpo's shot at NBA history, but the Milwaukee Bucks are hardly a one-man show. Khris Middleton hit a 3-pointer less than 20 seconds into the game, and the team with the league's best record never trailed Saturday night in a 111-95 victory over the Orlando Magic. It's the 13th time the Bucks have led from wire to wire this season. ""It's nice to not trail ... but it doesn't really mean anything. We have to keep playing good basketball,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We were up 27 and they came back, cut the lead to 11. So it doesn't mean anything,"" the league's reigning MVP added. ""We just try to take it quarter by quarter."" Antetokounmpo nearly had a triple-double with 18 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists while also falling short of becoming the first player in league history with at least 30 points, 15 rebounds and 5 assists in six consecutive games. Antetokounmpo was originally listed with 19 points, but the NBA announced later Saturday that he had been incorrectly credited with a made free throw that missed with 1:29 remaining in the first quarter and removed a point from his total and corrected the final score. With Middleton, Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe picking up the slack, it didn't matter as Milwaukee won for the 13th time in 14 games, improved to 45-7 overall and remained on course to become only the third team to top 70 wins in the regular season. ""A lot of people didn't think we would have a better team (than last season), but I trusted my team from day one,"" said Antetokounmpo, who finished 6 of 17 from the field. ""When we came together we knew what we had, and it shows on the court."" Wilt Chamberlain is the only other player with a stretch of five straight games with 30, 15 and 5, accomplishing it from Dec. 10-17, 1965, with the Philadelphia Warriors. Lopez led the Bucks with 23 points, including 5 for 5 on 3-point attempts. Middleton had 21 points and 13 rebounds, and Bledsoe finished with 18 points. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and 14 rebounds. Terrence Ross had 20 points, Markelle Fultz scored 15 and Evan Fournier added 14 for Orlando, which continues to hold the eighth playoff position in the Eastern Conference despite losing eight of its last nine. The Magic trailed 63-46 at halftime and by 27 when Milwaukee began the third quarter on 10-1 run, capped by Antetokounmpo's alley oop dunk. Orlando shot 37.8%, including 10 of 40 on 3-pointers. ""If we're going to beat them, as good as they are, we are going to have to make 3s, open 3s,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""That to me is the story of the game. ... Shotmaking is a huge part of our league, and it's been a weakness."" TIP-INS Bucks: G George Hill missed a fifth straight game with a strained left hamstring. Magic: F James Ennis, acquired from Philadelphia on Thursday, has not been activated, but may play Monday. ... G D.J. Augustin missed a 13th game with a knee injury. The Magic are hopeful he will return after the All-Star break. SEASON SWEEP Milwaukee swept the four-game season series between the teams by an average of 17 points per game. Antetokounmpo averaged 26.6 points, 15.8 rebounds and 7.8 assists in the three games he played. HELPING HAND The Magic and its Champions of the Community Partners -- Walt Disney World, L3Harris, PepsiCo, Insurance Office of America, RP Funding and AdventHealth -- teamed up to fight hunger with a volunteer project at Second Harvest Food Bank. As part of the Magic Volunteer Program, staff members from each organization sorted through and packed food that will be distributed to those in need in Central Florida. SAME PACE Orlando fell to 22-31, the same record they had through 53 games before making the playoffs at 42-40 last season. ""I don't know if we'll make a similar run but we can play better,"" Clifford said. ""You want to make the playoffs and be playing in a manner where you can play well, and that to me is what these games are for. But we need to make progress, particularly offensively."" LET 'EM FIRE AWAY The Bucks entered the game first in the NBA in defensive field-goal percentage at .410, despite also yielding the most 3-point field goals (14.12 per game) in the league. That's because opponents were attempting nearly 39 3s per game against them -- another league-high. ""Some people say we're happy to give up 3s, that's what we want to do. Not true,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""But there's a hierarchy that you go through defensively in trying to figure out what's important. You try and take everything away, but that's pretty much impossible.""","401161419"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Seth Curry has watched his older brother Stephen have some memorable homecoming games at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte. He figured he needed one of his own. A motivated Curry was impressive Saturday night in his hometown, making his first 10 shots from the field -- six of them 3-pointers -- and finishing with 26 points off the bench to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 116-100 victory over the Hornets. ""It felt really good,"" Curry said. ""I have watched Steph come in a couple of times and get hot and put on some great shows. I'm sure he's going to send me a text or say something funny."" Curry's big game came with his mother Sonya in the stands and his father Dell broadcasting the game for the Hornets. Dell Curry said he had a smile on his face much of the game. ""I am super excited for him,"" Dell Curry said after the game. ""... It makes it easier when your son plays well. So that was a lot of fun."" Because of injuries, this is only the second time the younger Curry has played in Charlotte during his NBA career. He participated here last year in the NBA All-Star 3-point contest against Steph and others, but didn't make it past the first round. ""I wanted to come here and play in front of family and friends,"" Curry said. ""Playing in your home city, it's different. You want to come in and put on a good show and have fun and that's what happened."" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle called Curry's effort amazing. ""I mean, at halftime he was 7 for 7 with 18 points,"" Carlisle said. ""Some guys, when they come home special things happen. He was cooking. It was something to see."" Willie Cauley-Stein added 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Mavericks, who played without Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis. Doncic missed his sixth straight game with a right ankle sprain, while Porzingis rested a sore left knee and is expected back on Monday night. Devonte Graham had 16 points and 10 assists for the struggling Hornets, who have lost 13 of their last 14 games. This one was never close. The Mavericks jumped out to a 31-10 lead in the first quarter behind 12 points from Curry and led by as many as 31 in the second half. ""We could sit up here and speculate all day long but the reality is that we just had a bad first quarter -- 31-10, scored 10 points in a quarter,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""That's going to be a tough grind to get back in that game. It was a disappointing start. I can't explain it. Obviously we've had a lot of things transpire here over the last few days. It is what it is but we have to be better. We own it, we have to take responsibility for it and get better."" TIP INS Mavericks: Tim Hardaway Jr. had 14 points. ...

A fan from South Carolina named Lawrence Thomas made a halfcourt shot at the end of the third quarter to win $10,000, drawing applause and smiles from both teams. DONCIC'S RETURN Carlise said after the game that Doncic is doing well in his recovery from a sprained ankle, and said he may return to action before the All-Star break. ""That's the hope, it's not definite but we're hopeful,"" Carlisle said. ROSTER MOVES The Hornets waived former No. 2 pick Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and 15-year NBA veteran Marvin Williams earlier in the day, which came as tough news to some of the current players. ""We just have to stay together,"" Graham said. ""Keep coming, keep fighting. You know in this league you never know. Guys get traded, guys leave and you got to be the next man up. Everybody collectively has to step their game up, whether it's leadership on the court, communication, all of that. Everybody has to do a bit more."" BOUNCE-BACK WIN The Mavericks were still stinging from a last-second loss to the Washington Wizards on Friday night on a layup by Bradley Beal with 0.2 seconds left -- and they seemed to take their frustration out on the Hornets. ""You've got a little bit of extra motivation after blowing one last night the way we did,"" Curry said. ""We made adjustments, watched the film today of the mistakes we made, made adjustments on both ends of the floor. That's the good thing about the league. You have a game like that, you have one the next night and we were able to come out and flush it.""","401161420"
"Stephen A. Smith questions how successful Leon Rose will be as president of the New York Knicks. (4:08) DETROIT --  Julius Randle and the New York Knicks took advantage of Andre Drummond's absence. With the game on the line, Randle and Mitchell Robinson came up with crucial offensive rebounds, and Randle eventually made a bank shot with 13.5 seconds left that helped New York hold on for a 95-92 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. The Knicks have won a season-high four straight. The Pistons are a shell of the team that began the season in Detroit. Blake Griffin has been out because of left knee surgery, and the Pistons traded Drummond to Cleveland on Thursday. With Drummond gone, New York had 16 offensive rebounds to Detroit's three. ""My mindset was if I wasn't the one attacking, getting the shot, if it comes off the rim, I'm going to get it no matter what,"" Randle said. ""Just down the stretch, we all made winning plays and did the right thing."" Randle scored 17 points. The Knicks led 91-89 when he made his bank shot inside to push the lead to four. Replays showed Detroit's Thon Maker appeared to take an arm to the face on the play, but it was not considered reviewable. Pistons coach Dwane Casey said Maker lost three teeth on the play. Christian Wood made a 3-pointer for Detroit to cut the lead to one, but Reggie Bullock of the Knicks made two free throws with 7.3 seconds left for the final margin. Reggie Jackson missed a last-second 3-pointer that would have tied it. ""They got after it and we gave up a lot of offensive boards,"" Jackson said. ""Second-chance opportunities -- they got 17 points, so that's very difficult. We've got to figure out a way to rebound as a collective group."" Jackson missed a driving layup attempt with about a minute left and the Pistons down two. Then New York's Elfrid Payton missed at the other end but Randle rebounded. Another miss by Payton was rebounded by Robinson, setting up Randle's basket that made it 93-89. ""We've talked about, so many times, how resilient this group has been,"" Knicks interim coach Mike Miller said. ""So, to see them have some excitement and have success like they're having, and the way they're staying together and they're getting contributions in so many areas. You had guys step up tonight at different points."" Wayne Ellington scored 17 points for the Knicks. Jackson had 20 points and nine assists.

NEWCOMER John Henson, who came to Detroit in the trade for Drummond, scored 12 points on 6-of-6 shooting. ""I loved it,"" Casey said. ""I thought he did a good job screening, cutting the pocket and kicking it out. He just did an excellent job for being at one shootaround. So, I think he is a good positive addition."" BALANCE The Knicks had five players in double figures, and the 11 players used by New York all scored. The bench outscored Detroit's reserves 46-25. ""We always try to use our bench as a strength,"" said Bobby Portis, who scored 11 points. ""Our goal is to try and come in and just try to change the game in any aspect we can. We were hitting shots tonight, being active, playing defense, and it really showed.""","401161421"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Not known for being expressive, Jrue Holiday couldnt help himself when he got hot at the ideal time on Saturday night. Holiday scored 14 of his 31 points in the final 2:26, including a go-ahead 3-pointer, and the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans beat the Indiana Pacers 124-117. The key 3 broke a 108-all tie with 2:26 remaining. When he hit another 3-pointer for a 118-110 lead, Holiday let loose with a spirited scream. Just passion for the game, he said. I love to play this game. When youre hot and got it going, sometimes that happens. Guess I was feeling it, huh? The Pelicans (22-31) were without Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson, their top two scorers who combine to average 44.7 points. But they still improved to 10-4 in their last 14 road games while handing the Pacers (31-22) their fifth consecutive loss. Despite missing the injured forwards, the Pelicans owned a 53-37 rebounding edge. Guard JJ Redick backed Holiday with 23 points off the bench. I would say that this is our best team win from the standpoint of I think everyone contributed at some stage and gave us a lift, said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. But it was Holiday, the seasoned 10-year pro, who capped his torrid finish with six consecutive free throws in the final 26.9 seconds. At the end, he did exactly what we needed him to do, Gentry said. He was aggressive, got the ball in the paint, and obviously made some shots. Holiday reminded how his team was humbled earlier this season when injuries ravaged the lineup, so he and his teammates know what it means to overcome adverse circumstances. Weve been through a lot, he said. I know early on we lost 13 straight. We had a lot of guys out. At one point, I think we were playing with six or seven guys. The Pacers overcame a 12-point deficit in the second quarter to take a 103-99 lead with 5:57 remaining. Then Holiday hit a step-back 3-pointer as the Pelicans rallied. Pacers coach Nate McMillan lamented his teams lack of defense in game where the Pelicans hit 15 of 38 3-point attempts to the home teams 9 of 26. Were not closing, McMillan said. Were not getting it done on either end of the floor. Jeremy Lamb led the Pacers with 26 points. T.J. Warren scored 22. They made shots, we didnt, Lamb said. They got stops, we didnt. TIP-INS Pelicans: Are 4-4 in games with Williamson in the lineup since his pro debut on Jan. 22.  Redick scored 13 points in the second quarter. Pacers: Two-time All-Star guard Victor Oladipo, who has been playing as a reserve with minutes closely monitored in five games since his season debut on Jan. 29, was given the night off to rest as part of his recovery from a season-ending quad injury last spring.  Lamb scored 12 first-quarter points. KNIGHT, KEADY HONORED Longtime college basketball coaches Bob Knight of Indiana and Gene Keady of Purdue were presented with commemorative jerseys at halftime. Earlier in the day, both attended the Boilermakers-Hoosiers game in Bloomington, where Knight returned to Assembly Hall for the first time in two decades. They faced each other 41 times, with the three-time national champion Knight ranking first and Keady second on the Big Ten career wins list.

Fred VanVleet scored 10 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, Pascal Siakam scored 20 points, including the tiebreaking free throw with 22 seconds remaining, and the Raptors extended their franchise-record winning streak to 14 by beating the Brooklyn Nets 119-118 on Saturday night. Terence Davis scored 20 points in his first home start, Matt Thomas had a career-high 15 and Serge Ibaka added 12 as the Raptors won despite playing without All-Star guard Kyle Lowry, earning their 10th consecutive home victory over the Nets. Toronto has won 18 of 19 in the series, including six straight. Davis started for Lowry, who was inactive because of a whiplash injury caused by an accidental collision with Ibaka in the third quarter of Friday's win at Indiana. Lowry was pictured on social media wearing a neck brace on the flight back to Toronto. VanVleet said the Raptors have become accustomed to winning without a complete lineup. ""At this point, I think we're experienced enough in that realm, unfortunately,"" VanVleet said. ""We've had a ton of guys out this year. We don't really think about it."" Besides Lowry, Raptors center Marc Gasol missed his sixth straight game because of a sore left hamstring, while guard Norman Powell sat for the fourth consecutive game because of a broken finger on his left hand. Davis shot 5 for 8 from 3-point range and VanVleet went 4 for 9 as the defending NBA champions remained unbeaten since a 105-104 home loss to San Antonio on Jan. 12. The Raptors swept their third straight set of back-to-back games. Caris LeVert scored a career-high 37 points, going 6 of 7 from long range, but missed a 3-pointer with a second left that would have given Brooklyn the win. ""I'm not really into moral victories,"" LeVert said of his high-scoring effort. ""I would much rather have played OK and got the win."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 21 points and 11 assists and DeAndre Jordan had 15 points and 14 rebounds, but the Nets lost for the first time in three games without injured guard Kyrie Irving (sprained right knee). Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson praised Toronto for ""incredible depth"" that has prolonged its current streak. ""That's how you go on a long streak in this league,"" Atkinson said. ""You just can't do it with your top five or your top six. You've got to be deep, and they are deep."" The Nets trailed by 12 points to begin the fourth but LeVert scored on three straight possessions to tie it at 118 with 35 seconds left. Siakam restored Toronto's lead by splitting a pair of free throws with 22 seconds remaining. The Nets let the clock run down and gave LeVert a chance to win it, but his pull-up 3 bounced off the rim. Brooklyn's Joe Harris grabbed the rebound, but missed a layup as the buzzer sounded. ""They guarded it pretty well,"" LeVert said of the final play. ""I tried to get a good shot up but they played pretty good defense on it."" LeVert has scored 20 or more in three straight games, the longest such streak of his career. ""He caught his rhythm and he's doing it consistently now."" Atkinson said. ""It's game after game."" Up 36-33 after one, Brooklyn missed seven straight shots to begin the second, a slump that ended on a reverse dunk by Jordan with 7:30 left in the quarter. Thomas scored 11 points in the second and Siakam had eight as Toronto outscored Brooklyn 33-18 to lead 66-54 at halftime. Davis scored 11 points in the third and VanVleet added nine as Toronto took a 100-88 lead to the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Taurean Prince missed seven of eight shot attempts in the first.

Thomas also matched his career best with six rebounds. TAKE CARE Toronto matched a season low with seven turnovers. The Raptors didn't turn the ball over at all in the fourth.","401161423"

Malik Beasley made his Minnesota debut with his first career double-double, Jordan McLaughlin scored a career-high 24 points, and the new-look Timberwolves snapped a 13-game losing streak with a 142-115 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. ""Amazing, man,"" Beasley said. ""First career double-double. It don't get no better than that. And a `W' after 13 losses, that's the most important thing right there."" Beasley, who arrived from Denver as part of Wednesday's four-team trade, scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.

McLaughlin added a career-high 11 assists as Minnesota scored its highest point total of the season thanks to a franchise-record 26 3-pointers and a season-high 39 assists. ""I think my dinner's going to taste a little better tonight,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""I might get a little more sleep. I'm just happy for that locker room.

""Just didn't bring it,"" Leonard said. ""Can't really explain it. There's no excuses for it. They played harder."" The Timberwolves turned over more than half their roster before Thursday's trade deadline. Three separate trades Wednesday and Thursday sent out seven players and brought in eight.

Ten Timberwolves players hit 3s, setting a franchise record. Beasley made a career-high seven 3s. Seven Minnesota players scored in double figures, including all five starters. ""When the new guys got into the locker room, they brought a lot of energy,"" McLaughlin said. ""As you could tell, it carried over today."" The Timberwolves shot 15 for 25 from 3-point range in the first half and took an 81-59 lead into halftime. The 81 points were a franchise record for points in a half and the most allowed by the Clippers in a half this season. Minnesota led by as many as 26 points in the second half.

"Steph Curry discusses with Lisa Salters how his rehab from a broken hand is going and how he sees Andrew Wiggins fitting in with the Warriors. (2:42) SAN FRANCISCO --  Steve Kerr's instructions for Andrew Wiggins before his first game with Golden State were simple and basic: Sprint the floor. No requirements or rules about shots. Just some good old hustle. ""I told him, `No matter what happens we need you to sprint the floor, both ways,"" Kerr said after Wiggins scored 24 points in his impressive Warriors debut Saturday night, a 125-120 loss to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. James leaned on his supporting cast to carry the load until he heated up in the second half and finished with 22 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Wiggins shot 8 for 12 with three 3-pointers and accounted for five the Warriors' 15 steals. Golden State acquired him from the Minnesota Timberwolves before Thursday's deadline in exchange for D'Angelo Russell, Jacob Evans III and Omari Spellman. Kerr also appreciated having Wiggins to defend James ""and at least match up physically."" ""It's the hardest position to guard these days in the NBA,"" Kerr said. Wiggins knew his job on night No. 1 was to ""compete"" and focus on playing fundamental basketball. Now, he is ready to embrace a new start out West with some sunny California weather and Stephen Curry as a cheerleader on the sideline as the two-time MVP works back from a broken left hand. ""I was like if it happens it happens, it's going to be a blessing either way,"" Wiggins said. ."".. This whole thing didn't really feel real until they announced my name."" Avery Bradley added 21 points with five 3-pointers and Anthony Davis had 27 points and 10 rebounds for Los Angeles on a night the Warriors honored Kobe Bryant, his daughter, Gianna, and the other seven helicopter crash victims during Golden State's first home game since the deadly accident Jan. 26 in Southern California. The Lakers, who had lost three of their previous five including a 121-111 defeat at home to Houston on Thursday, tried to pull away in the third against the new-look Warriors but Golden State stayed just close enough to make it interesting down the stretch. Marquese Chriss shot 12 for 15 on the way to 26 points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Warriors, who got within 116-111 on Eric Paschall's dunk with 3:13 to play. Ky Bowman contributed 10 assists and Jordan Poole scored 19 points off the bench. Wiggins' addition meant a lot to the young Golden State core that is still around on the league's last-place team at 12-41. ""That is who he is,"" Chriss said. ""He's one of those people you could consider a professional scorer."" BRYANT TRIBUTE A 24-second moment of silence was held for the nine helicopter crash victims, who were honored on the outdoor video board at Chase Center. All fans received a black Bryant T-shirt with his Nos. 8 and 24 and Gianna's 2. Nine beams of light were shone up from the court before the game in remembrance. Kerr admires James for saying he will carry on Bryant's legacy. ""You are talking about two of the greatest players in the history of the game. LeBron is already doing that. He was doing that most of his career,"" Kerr said. ""Once he established himself as one of the very best, he was carrying on the legacies of previous greats. It's how this league works. It will be very emotional tonight for all of us to honor Kobe."" ""... It's amazing the sense of loss even for those of us that didn't know him very well. Everything just feels hollow. We grieve for Kobe and Gianna and the other families all involved. It's something that's not going to get any easier right away."" LITTLE TUMBLE Just as he was finishing up his extensive pregame stretching routine in the locker room, James toppled backward and fell to the floor. All was OK. ""Breaking news ... LeBron out,"" King James said with a smile after hopping right back to his feet and heading to the court to shoot. James committed seven turnovers. WELCOME BACK The Warriors hung a trio of posters at the entrance to the Lakers locker room welcoming back former Golden State players JaVale McGee, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook. Kerr and McGee briefly caught up before the game near the Warriors locker room. A photo of Cook and Cousins was also shown on the big screen late in the first quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers shot 59.1% in the first quarter, making 5 of 7 3s. They finished 14 for 29 from deep. ... The bench scored 41 points, 12 by Dwight Howard and 11 from Rajon Rondo. ... L.A. has won 14 straight on the road vs. the Western Conference and is 16-1 overall against the West away from Staples Center. Warriors: With all the change, before the game Golden State's fifth starter was still listed as TBD -- not something seen often -- though Kerr had said it would be Bowman. ... Golden State signed guards Zach Norvell Jr. and Jeremy Pargo to 10-day contracts. The Warriors already had added Chriss and Bowman on Friday by converting their two-way contracts. ...

"PHOENIX --  Jamal Murray poured in the points for the Nuggets, Torrey Craig stopped the Suns from scoring them and Denver finished off a season sweep of Phoenix. Murray had another big night on the Suns' home floor, scoring 36 points while making 14 of 17 shots from the field, including 6 of 8 from 3-point range in the Nuggets' 117-108 victory on Saturday night. He scored 28 in Denver's win in Phoenix on Dec. 23. ""A lot of guys can score 36 points, but can they do it as efficiently as he did tonight?"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""So that's a huge credit to him. A big, big night for him."" Denver won all four games against Phoenix this season and has won five of six overall. The Nuggets led 83-78 going into the final quarter and never trailed in the fourth, turning back a few Phoenix rallies. ""I was making shots. I had the rhythm,"" Murray said. ""I wasn't going to force anything. I had five turnovers so I am disappointed about that, but we were just playing free. We weren't putting any pressure on ourselves."" Jokic added nine rebounds and six assists. Paul Millsap -- who was playing in his first game since Jan. 6 -- had 12 points, 11 rebounds and four assists in 18 minutes off the bench. Deandre Ayton finished with 28 points and 19 rebounds for the Suns. Devin Booker added 21 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 20. Booker's been one of the NBA's most efficient scorers this season, but Craig made life difficult for him, and Booker finished just 5 of 16 from the field. ""I really think Torrey Craig is an All-NBA defender,"" Malone said. ""I know people outside of Denver might not even know who Torrey Craig is, but if you look at the job he's done on some of the best players in the NBA, some of the top guards in the West, Torrey Craig deserves to be in that conversation."" Phoenix led 37-28 after the first quarter but Denver rallied to take a 55-54 advantage by halftime. Murray had 17 points before the break while Jokic had 10. Ayton had 18 points and 11 rebounds. Phoenix has lost five of its last six games. The Suns couldn't keep their momentum from Friday night's impressive 127-91 win over the Houston Rockets. ""I thought we were a bit tired tonight,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""We missed some open looks. Last night everything was dropping. Tonight, we missed a ton of 3s. We got 32 of them up, shot 28 percent. A little bit of that is fatigue on a back-to-back."" AYTON'S REBOUNDS Ayton grabbed his 1,000th career rebound in the third quarter and needed just 94 career games to reach the milestone, which was the fewest games needed to reach 1,000 in franchise history. Since 1992, only Shaquille O'Neal, Blake Griffin and Tim Duncan reached 1,000 rebounds faster. ""It shows where my hard work is going,"" Ayton said. ""I want a `W', that's the best milestone you can possibly get, but it's good to know that."" Ayton's been on a roll of late, averaging 22.2 points and 13.6 rebounds over the past five games. TIP-INS Nuggets: Millsap missed 16 straight games with a left knee injury before playing against the Suns. ... Guard Will Barton (left knee inflammation) and forwards Bol Bol (left foot injury management), Mason Plumlee (right footid injury) and Michael Porter Jr. (right ankle injury) didn't play. ... Keita Bates-Diop played in his first game with the Nuggets since being traded from the Timberwolves earlier this week. He had four points and two rebounds in 14 minutes. Suns: The Suns made all 23 of their free throws on Saturday. It's the 29th time in franchise history that the team's been 100 percent from the line. ... Guard Tyler Johnson (right knee soreness) and forwards Aron Baynes (left hip soreness), Frank Kaminsky III (right patella stress fracture) and Dario Saric (left ankle sprain) didn't play.","401161426"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Sacramento Kings are finally building some momentum, although it might be too late to get them back in playoff contention. San Antonio also has hopes of playing in the postseason but the Spurs are headed in the opposite direction. Buddy Hield scored 31 points and made nine 3-pointers, Harrison Barnes added 25 points and the Kings beat the Spurs 122-102 on Saturday night. ""We defended, we rebounded and we shared the ball,"" Hield said. ""We made shots. When you make shots, the ball moves a lot easier and the team gets more confidence. It was a spark that we needed. Hopefully we keep this up and build from this."" Nemanja Bjelica had 15 points and six rebounds as the Kings won their third straight and sixth in eight games. Kent Bazemore scored 15 points and De'Aaron Fox had 13 points and five assists. Sacramento is in 12th place in the West, five games behind Memphis for the final playoff spot. San Antonio is only in slightly better position. The Spurs are in 10th place, one game ahead of the Kings and four back of the Grizzlies. ""We have a problem sustaining good play for 48 minutes,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said ""At the end of the third quarter, the last four minutes, it was a great game and we get outscored 17-2 with the second team out there. That's unacceptable. Those guys have to man up and play better."" Hield became the fastest player in NBA history to reach 800 career 3-pointers, doing it in 296 games. Golden State's Stephen Curry was the previous fastest, having reached 800 in 305 games. Hield was 9 of 10 beyond the arc and was greeted with chants of ""Buddy! Buddy!"" after making his ninth to put the Kings up 120-98. ""Some of the shots are tough that he's making,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""It's finding that balance of having that gunslinger mentality that he has that makes him great and makes him so hard to guard, but also finding that balance and the discipline to do it within the offense."" Sacramento made 19 3-pointers for the second consecutive game. Dejounte Murray had 17 points, nine assists and nine rebounds for San Antonio. LaMarcus Aldridge added 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Spurs have lost four straight and seven of nine. San Antonio's frustrations boiled over in the fourth quarter when DeMar DeRozan was ejected after picking up consecutive technicals. DeRozan, who earlier was called for a pair of offensive fouls, was angry after being whistled on the defensive end and began to argue. After being hit with the first technical, DeRozan continued yelling at officials and was called for a second. The Spurs were down by 13 at the time so it hardly mattered in the final outcome. But for a team that has dropped seven of nine, it was another blow. ""I felt like we were getting hit all night,"" DeRozan said. ""Every little ticky-tack whatever they did seemed to get called. I just rather it be consistent on both ends."" TIP-INS Spurs: DeRozan had 14 points and six assists before getting tossed. . Aldridge needs 28 points to pass Sean Elliott into 7th place on the Spurs' career scoring list. Kings: General manager Vlade Divac tried to remain optimistic regarding the health of Marvin Bagley III. Bagley has missed 39 of Sacramento's 52 games because of injuries and is currently sidelined by a left foot sprain. Divac was asked if Bagley, the No. 2 overall pick last season, might have to be shut down for the remainder of the season. ""I hope not,"" he said. Bagley sounded equally hopeful after the game, although he's wearing a walking boot again.","401161427"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  With most of their lead gone, the Boston Celtics needed someone to make a stop in the final seconds. As usual, Marcus Smart took it upon himself. Smart o stole the ball from Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 5.8 seconds le,fhelping the Celtics hold on for a 112-111 victory over the Thunder on Sundayry. ""I didn't even want to give them an attempt to even get a shot up and a chance to tie the game or come close to it,"" Smart said. Kemba Walker scored 27 points and Jayson Tatum had 26 for the Celtics, who won their seventh straight. ""Good, tough teams,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""A lot of smart basketball and then we almost gave it away at the end. But, you know, up to that point I think we played really hard and really well."" Jaylen Brown finished with 17 points for the Celtics, who made 16 3-pointers. One of them, by Smart with 8:19 remaining, gave Boston the lead for good. Danilo Gallinari and Gilgeous-Alexander each had 24 points for the Thunder, while point guards Chris Paul and Dennis Schroder finished with 22 apiece. Oklahoma City had its four-game winning streak snapped. ""I thought our guys really, really competed and played,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We weren't able to finish well enough in some crucial situations."" Oklahoma City led 61-52 at halftime but Tatum heated up in the third quarter. His 3-pointer made it 70-68 with 7:38 left in the period. ""I thought they were the aggressor in the last 14 minutes of the first half,"" Stevens said. ""And then we were great out of the gate in the second and then it went back and forth."" Boston led 109-101 after Walker made his second straight 3-pointer, but Oklahoma City battled back and had a chance to tie after Schroder blocked Gordon Hayward's layup. But Smart stripped Gilgeous-Alexander before he had a chance to take what would have been a game-tying 3-pointer. ""It took a lot of grit,"" Tatum said. ""They are a really good team. They are tough and they compete, so we just had to match their intensity."" Paul hit a 3-pointer at the final buzzer, but Smart's defense was enough to clinch the win. ""I saw an opportunity to make a play, and I made it,"" Smart said. TIP-INS Celtics: Brown and Daniel Theis both were questionable before tipoff with right ankle sprains, but both started and played at least 30 minutes. . Tatum scored 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting in the third quarter. . Smart picked up a technical foul because he stayed on the court after the halftime buzzer arguing with officials. Thunder: Gilgeous-Alexander didn't record a block for the first time in 10 games. . Terrance Ferguson played 26:18 in his third game back from an eight-game absence for personal reasons. He didn't score. . Darius Bazley didn't play after halftime because a right knee sprain. He injured his knee on a layup late in the second quarter. CAPITALIZING The Celtics forced only 10 Thunder turnovers, but they were able to score 21 points off of those. Boston also excelled in fast-break situations, scoring 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting. QUOTABLE Tatum, on how often Smart makes game-changing plays: ""Every time we need it. He definitely saved us today, saved me from the three turnovers I had late in the stretch, so that was a big-time play by him."" Smart finished four steals and seven points in 22 minutes.","401161428"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young was disappointed that the Atlanta Hawks let New York rally in regulation and take a big lead in the first overtime, so he repeatedly took the ball and dared the Knicks to foul him. ""When you had that lead late in the game and you feel like we should've won in regulation, and then they send it to overtime, it kills momentum,"" Young said. ""That kind of took a lot of energy out of us, but we found a way to keep battling, keep making shots and getting stops on the defensive end."" Young had 48 points and 13 assists, John Collins added 32 points and 16 rebounds, and the Hawks beat the New York 140-135 in two overtimes on Sunday night. It was the ninth time Young has scored at least 40, second-most in the NBA this season. The first-time All-Star hit all 16 of his free throw attempts and knocked down six 3-pointers. Julius Randle finished with 35 points and 18 rebounds, and Reggie Bullock scored 21 points for New York, which had its four-game winning streak snapped. Playing their third game in four nights, the Knicks dropped to 17-37 after trailing by 16 in the fourth. They led by eight in the first overtime before letting the Hawks back in it. ""We fought extremely hard. I'm proud of my guys,"" Randle said before adding it was ""a game like we feel we should have won. Let it slip away."" Young, who forced a tie at the end of the first overtime with a pair of free throws, hit two free throws on consecutive possessions to give the Hawks, who began the night with the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference, a 130-128 lead early in the second overtime. Atlanta called timeout at the 13-second mark, and Young followed with two more free throws to make it 138-133. ""It's not tough when you practice it as hard as I do,"" he said. ""I actually feel like I should be shooting a better free throw percentage this year (than 85.1). All it takes is concentration and practice."" Young hit two free throws to tie it at 116 with 30 seconds left in regulation, but he and Randle both missed runners on each team's final possession to force overtime. The Knicks had a 15-point lead on Bobby Portis' pull-up jumper early in the second. New York entered halftime with a 63-61 advantage. ""We got a little bit conservative when we had a lead,"" New York interim coach Mike Miller said. Collins said the Hawks, who rank second-worst in defensive scoring, need to concentrate better when they have a lead and not let opponents score so easily. They came out too flat to begin the first overtime. ""We didn't really hit first,"" Collins said. ""We sort of let them hit first. I think we did the opposite in the second overtime. Hopefully it doesn't take us two overtimes to tighten up next time."" TIP-INS Knicks: F Maurice Harkless, acquired last Thursday from the Los Angeles Clippers, had an illness and missed his second straight game. ... Randle had his fifth 30-point game this season, his first with the team. ... Wayne Ellington has made the most of his latest turn in the rotation, scoring 17, 12 and 15 points in the last three games. ... New York beat the Hawks 143-120 at home the last time the teams met Dec. 17, marking the club's largest offensive output since Nov. 11, 1980. Rookie RJ Barrett had 27 points on 10-for-13 shooting in that game. He had five points this time. Hawks; Young (right ankle contusion) and Hunter (left ankle sprain) were listed on the pregame injury list. C Clint Capela (right heel bruise), DeAndre' Bembry (right hand neuritis), F Cam Reddish (concussion) and F-C Skal Labissiere (left knee cartilage) were out. HOT EARLY Randle, with his 22nd double-double this season, and Collins both scored 20 in the first half. Randle had 10 rebounds. Collins had six. HE'S HERE Capela, acquired last Wednesday from Houston, wants to make his Atlanta debut as soon as the All-Star break ends Feb. 20, but coach Lloyd Pierce said the team won't rush him. Atlanta wants him fully healthy before he plays. Either way, Capela looks forward to playing alongside Young after he spent so much of his career with Rockets star James Harden. ""(Young) puts a lot of rhythm on the offense,"" Capela said. ""It's definitely the way I like to play. We definitely should be able to do some magic together."" Capela wasn't so much surprised by the trade because ""that's what Houston does,"" he said. ""I know that there was only me and James left since I got (there),"" Capela said. ""I was ready for it. I felt more like a rookie in my six years there. Here I feel like a vet.""","401161429"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The 76ers made a trade for a pair of outside shooters to help make a deep run in the playoffs. Turns out, the player they needed might have been there the whole time. Furkan Korkmaz topped 30 points for the second straight contest with 31, Joel Embiid had 28 points and 12 rebounds and Philadelphia beat the Chicago Bulls 118-111 on Sunday night to improve their NBA-best home record to 24-2. Korkmaz made 12 of 17 field goals, going 6 of 11 on 3-pointers. He stayed hot after netting a career-high 34 points in Friday's 119-107 home win over Memphis in which he drained 13 of 17 shot and was 7 of 9 on 3-pointers. ""I'm just trying to play my best basketball, and my strongest part of my game is shooting,"" he said. The 76ers acquired wings Glenn Robinson III and Alec Burks at the trade deadline. Although it appears otherwise, Korkmaz says it's just a coincidence that he's had the best two games of his career on back-to-back nights since the trade. ""It's not really about that,"" he said. ""It's just trying to help the team on the court. I'm trying to put the team first. I'm really happy I'm helping my teammates."" Ben Simmons added 19 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for the 76ers. Zach LaVine scored 32 points and Luke Kornet added 25 for the short-handed Bulls, who have lost five straight. ""I thought we played hard, I thought we played together, I thought we got a lot from a lot of guys,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""They've got a good basketball team."" Embiid put Philadelphia ahead for good early in the fourth, breaking a tie to start the period with a short jumper and follow dunk that made it 87-83 with 11 minutes left. The 76ers kept the lead the rest of the way -- although it wasn't exactly easy against the plucky and undermanned Bulls. Chicago got within two points twice, but the 76ers finally got some breathing room on Tobias Harris' 3 that made it 104-95 with 6:22 to play. Korkmaz put it away with a two-possession sequence where he hit a 3-pointer and followed with a one-handed dunk that pushed him over 30 points for the second straight contest and made it 111-101 with 3:57 left. EMBITTERED EMBIID Despite his statistics, Embiid still felt his performance fell below his standards. ""I didn't shoot the ball well, didn't play well, just not myself, it's frustrating, just have to keep trying to get better,"" he said. The 76ers' All-Star center put his index finger to his mouth and appeared to yell, ""Shut up!"" after draining a 3-pointer with 38 seconds left. Asked if he was directing that at Philadelphia fans, who loudly booed the 76ers when they went down 65-62 early in the third quarter, Embiid responded this way: ""I don't care how it looks. Just playing basketball. Just getting back to myself ... Just playing basketball and trying to dominate."" M.A.S.H. UNIT Chicago has a long list of injured players: Lauri Markkanen (right hip) missed his eighth straight; Otto Porter Jr. (broken left foot) has been out since Nov. 6; Wendell Carter (sprained right ankle) has sat for 17 in a row; Kris Dunn (sprained right knee) missed his third consecutive game; and Denzel Valentine (strained hamstring) and Daniel Gafford (ankle) sat for the second straight game.

He finished with 10 points. Burks didn't play. Robinson averaged 12.9 points and shot 40 percent from 3-point range in 48 games, while Burks netted 16.1 points and hit 36 percent from the arc in 48 games.

"WASHINGTON --  The Memphis Grizzlies believe their resilience helps them overcome rough shooting nights like Sunday. Having Ja Morant helps, too. Morant had 27 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double, and the Grizzlies shook off their 3-point woes in a 106-99 victory over the Washington Wizards. Memphis remained eighth in the Western Conference while improving to 27-26. That's one victory more than some sportsbooks projected the Grizzlies to earn all season. ""I feel like we all here just have a chip on our shoulder,"" said Morant, who is now those same sportsbooks' favorite in the NBA Rookie of the Year race. ""Like I said before, they had us picked to win 26 games this year. That's a chip right there, and we just passed that tonight. But the chip won't leave."" Morant scored 10 of his points in the fourth quarter for Memphis, which closed the game on a 22-8 run after trailing for most of the second half. Kyle Anderson added 16 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 14 to go with 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who won despite shooting 5 of 32 from beyond the arc. Jonas Valanciunas had 18 rebounds, part of a 62-50 edge the visitors held on the boards. ""It took some gutsy stuff out there,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""This is, I like to think, kind of a defining moment for our guys having to kind of fight through one of the toughest offensive nights for us."" Bradley Beal scored 26 points for Washington, which led by as many as 12 early but shot 4 of 26 in the fourth quarter. Rui Hachimura had 12 points and 11 assists as the Wizards dropped three games behind Orlando for the final playoff spot in the East. Moritz Wagner had 19 points off the bench, while Davis Bertans added 15 on a night Washington shot nearly as bad as Memphis beyond the arc (7 of 33) and worse overall (34 of 101). ""Sometimes we come down and we can't get stops, and we can't make shots either,"" Beal said afterward. ""So it's like, something's got to give."" Morant was the instigator throughout the Grizzlies' late run. He found Anderson underneath for a layup to tie it at 93 with 5:33 remaining before hitting two free throws to give Memphis its first lead of the half 26 seconds later. Clarke's 3-pointer on his only attempt behind the arc stretched the lead to five before Morant found Anderson inside again to make it 102-95. Morant's 3 from the right elbow with made it 105-96 with 44 seconds remaining, sending much of the Washington crowd to the exits. ""That guy is young, but he plays like a five-year All-Star,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Morant. ""He just controls the game. ... He's a problem.""

"Russell Westbrook says it's no different how he attacks a center compared to anyone else guarding him, he's still going to go right through their chest. (0:50) HOUSTON --  Jazz coach Quin Snyder kept telling Bojan Bogdanovic to keep playing despite his shooting struggles on Sunday night. Bogdanovic ended up hitting the biggest shot of the game. Bogdanovic's 3-pointer as time expired gave Utah a 114-113 victory over the Houston Rockets. ""The play was designed for me to shoot a 3,"" Bogdanovic said. ""It's big-time from their part to have that trust and confidence in me to make that shot after the game that I had."" Bogdanovic finished with eight points on 2-of-7 shooting. ""You just play him, let him play,"" Snyder said. ""He's such a competitor, and I tell him to keep playing. If he needs to hear that, he knows how much I trust him."" Jordan Clarkson scored 30 points and Donovan Mitchell finished with 24 points, six assists and five rebounds for the Jazz, who won their second straight after a five-game losing streak. ""They made a heck of a shot,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We had two guys on him. I was afraid we were going to foul him (because) it was so close. Hats off to that shot."" It came after P.J. Tucker's 3-pointer from the corner gave Houston a two-point lead with 1.6 seconds remaining. Following a timeout, Bogdanovic came off a screen and hit a contested 29-footer to give the Jazz the win. ""I had kind of two guys on me,"" Bogdanovic said. ""The first moment I thought they might block me or foul me on the shot. Then, as soon as I kind of released the ball from my hand, I saw it in there."" Tucker knew immediately it was going in.

Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 15 rebounds. The Jazz shot 49%, including 15 of 38 on 3-pointers. ""We'll take it,"" Conley said of the win. ""We would have liked to have won it on the last stop. Obviously, P.J. Tucker got a good luck and made that, and that's the league. We came down and were able to draw up a good play for Bogi, and he was able to make it.

"CLEVELAND --  The presence of Andre Drummond began the night with optimism for the Cleveland Cavaliers. That positive feeling was quickly dashed by a 133-92 loss Sunday to the Los Angeles Clippers, the Cavaliers' worst home defeat in franchise history. ""Tonight was pretty ugly, so show 'em your worst first and you only can go up from there,"" Kevin Love said. Drummond started in his first game with Cleveland after being acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline. He scored 19 points, had 14 rebounds and even hit a pair of 3-pointers in 29 minutes. Drummond's numbers weren't nearly enough as the Clippers led wire-to-wire without star forward Kawhi Leonard. Cleveland's previous worst was a 39-point loss to Chicago in 2012. Lou Williams scored 25 points, Paul George had 22 and Marcus Morris added 10 in his first game with the Clippers. Los Angeles' biggest lead was 45 points in the fourth quarter after coach Doc Rivers had given his starters the rest of the night off. Drummond stressed patience after Cleveland's 12th straight loss at home. The Cavaliers have dropped 13 of 14 overall. ""We're not looking at the scoreboard,"" he said. ""I said it when I first got here in the locker room. I don't care about the record. I don't care about the scoreboard. I just care about, did we get better today? My goal is to push these guys and keep them positive, continue to work hard and show no quit on this season."" The Clippers didn't miss Leonard, who was out because of a sore left knee. Morris, acquired from New York at the trade deadline, started in Leonard's spot at power forward and played 22 minutes. The Clippers were obviously angry following an embarrassing 142-115 loss in Minnesota on Saturday. Los Angeles shot 70% percent in the first quarter, making 14 of 20 from the field. ""There are nights for whatever reason, it's the perfect storm,"" Rivers said. ""Last night was one of those. You just move on from it."" Morris knocked Drummond to the floor with a hard foul as Cleveland's center tried to score in the third quarter. The play was upgraded to a flagrant foul after a review. Morris' final game with the Knicks came in Cleveland on Feb. 3. He scored 26 points in New York's overtime win. ""That was cool, man,"" Morris said of his debut. ""The guys made the game easy. I asked them before the game where they liked the ball and they asked me where I wanted it."" Drummond replaced Tristan Thompson, who has started 48 games. Thompson came off the bench and scored seven points in 19 minutes. Love had 10 points in 26 minutes. Drummond ran through some drills during a Saturday workout to get familiarized with the team's system. ""We had no practice time, so it was expected for us to come out and look lost, obviously because we were trying to figure out plays,"" he said. ""I didn't really know many plays yet."" .TIP-INS Clippers: Leonard missed his 13th game of the season. ... G Patrick Beverley (strained right groin) was out for second straight game. ... Los Angeles wore throwback Buffalo Braves uniforms. The franchise played in Buffalo from 1970-78. Cavaliers: Drummond is 3 for 24 on 3-pointers this season. .... Thompson hit his fourth career 3-pointer in the second quarter. ... Kevin Porter Jr. had 17 points. TOUGH TIMES The Cavaliers' celebration of their 50th season in the NBA has seen the team have the worst record in the Eastern Conference. ""We were not good and way out of sync in so many ways,"" coach John Beilein said of the latest loss. ""While it's not acceptable to us, it's understandable given the new dynamic of our team. So coaches will meet again tomorrow and we will try to get some better symmetry on it."" WELCOME BACK Clippers assistant Tyronn Lue was the Cavaliers' coach during their 2016 NBA championship season. He returned to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse for the first time since being fired by Cleveland after six games last season. Lue was given a standing ovation and waved to the crowd when he was introduced during a timeout. ""This is the house that Jim Brewer and Ty Lue built,"" Rivers said. ""It's a great feeling when you return to a place you won a championship. Heck, he had a parade in the streets here. That's a pretty good memory."" Brewer, who played for the Cavaliers and several other teams in a 10-year NBA career, is Rivers' uncle.","401161433"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Andre Iguodala fell short in his first chance to get a win with the Miami Heat. His next one will come against his former team. Damian Lillard had 33 points and eight assists, Gary Trent Jr. scored 22 points and the Portland Trail Blazers beat Miami 115-109 on Sunday night. Iguodala had two points in his first game since the NBA Finals. ""It felt good tonight,"" Iguodala said. ""I wanted to get a feel for where I was at. Honestly, I haven't even played a pickup game or anything since the finals. I was trying to get a feel for where my mind was. Overall, I felt really good out there."" For Iguodala and the Heat, the next game will be at Golden State, where he was a member of three championship teams and the MVP of the 2015 NBA Finals. ""I've played a lot of basketball games in my career, so the emotional highs and lows, I don't have anymore,"" Iguodala said of returning to play his former team. ""For this team, more importantly, we want to win. This road trip is tough with a lot of guys down. We've got new bodies and us getting a win is more important than how I feel."" Hassan Whiteside had 11 points and 17 rebounds against his former team, including a pair of free throws with 11.5 seconds left that gave Portland a seven-point lead. While Lillard has been the catalyst for everything, the Blazers have gotten a major shot in the arm from Trent. The former bench warmer has averaged more than 14 points over the last five games and has shot above 51% on 3-pointers during that stretch. ""You just love to see it,"" Lillard said. ""I told him the other day, I don't know if I've been more proud or happier for another player or a younger player since I've been in the league. A second-round pick, McDonald's All-American and went Duke, but doesn't get an opportunity right away. He had a lot to learn, his dad played in the league, and he did it."" Trent's play hasn't gone unnoticed by opponents either, especially after he hit a 3-pointer with 2:08 left to put Portland up 110-103. ""He has really stepped up and played well,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It's not easy to be a role player with great players. That sounds easy but you have to do a lot of the little things. At the end of the clock teams are trying to get the ball out of the great players' hands and you have to step up and he hit a big shot."" Goran Dragic had 27 points for Miami, which played without Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro. Duncan Robinson had 19 points, but just four after halftime. Iguodala, acquired from Memphis before the trade deadline, made his Miami debut in the first quarter, wearing No. 28. He made an impact with a block of Portland's Mario Hezonja. In the second quarter, Hezonja sprained his left ankle and did not return, leaving Portland with just eight available players. After a foul was called on Lillard with 0.9 seconds left in the third quarter, Blazers coach Terry Stotts challenged the call. The call was overturned after the review, which showed a clean block by Lillard and a loose ball foul on Dragic. Lillard made both free throws to give the Blazers a 93-83 lead heading into the final period. Iguodala began the fourth quarter with an assist to Chris Silva on an alley-oop. A steal by Iguodala on the next possession led to Robinson's 3-pointer, forcing a Blazers timeout with 11:01 left. Bam Adebayo's layup cut the Blazers' lead to 111-108 with 46 seconds left. However, Lillard answered back with a layup of his own to push the lead back to 113-108 with 25 seconds left. After the Heat had three opportunities to cut into the lead, Whiteside grabbed the rebound and was fouled. TIP-INS Heat: Sunday was the first game for the Heat with new additions Iguodala and Jae Crowder. Iguodala has plenty of respect in the league still. ""I see a winning player,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""He is an experienced, winning player. A very good wing defender. I think he complements the Miami roster really well, with the versatility that he brings at both ends."" Trail Blazers: Lillard's recent sizzling stretch caught the eye of Spoelstra. ""It's been a little bit of a habit of mine,"" he said. ""We play our game East Coast time and I throw on a West Coast game and it usually ends on Portland for the last two weeks with what this guy has been doing. The whole league has been watching. They're in a desperate situation trying to make the playoffs. You have to respect the urgency and toughness and focus that they are going to bring into every single game."" Lillard had averaged over 41 points per game over the past 10 games entering Sunday.","401161434"
"DETROIT --  No matter how bad things get for the Charlotte Hornets, they always seem to be able to fix them by playing the Detroit Pistons. Miles Bridges scored 18 points Monday night and the Hornets ended a five-game losing streak with an 87-76 victory, their 10th straight over Detroit. The streak includes two consecutive 4-0 season sweeps. The Hornets are 13-36 against the rest of the league and had lost 13 of their previous 14 games. ""I don't know how to explain it,"" Bridges said. ""They play good against everybody else and then when we come in, it is different. It's always a close game when we play them, but I want to keep the streak going."" Malik Monk added 17 points for the Hornets while Devonte' Graham had 14 points and 11 assists. Charlotte won despite shooting 37.5% from the floor. ""Obviously, we've had moments where we can't throw it in the ocean -- shooting 37% isn't where we want to be -- but we kept digging in and getting stops,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""I think we showed pride in our defense tonight."" The Pistons have lost three straight and nine of 11. Thon Maker led Detroit with 12 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Bruce Brown added 10 points and 12 rebounds. ""This was just an ugly game on both sides,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I thought we played hard but we didn't play smart enough. We're in a funk right now, and we've got to get out of it. No one is going to feel sorry for us."" Detroit shot 35.4% and turned the ball over 21 times for 24 points. ""If you look at the box score, the first thing you see is the points off turnovers,"" Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson said. ""We lost that battle by 14 points and lost the game by 11, so that's a huge difference."" After trailing by as many as 15 points in the first half, Detroit got as close as two in the third quarter. However, late 3-pointers by Monk and Bridges put Charlotte ahead 66-59 going into the fourth. The Hornets led 70-63 with 7:51 to play, then went on an 8-0 run that included 3-pointers from Jalen McDaniels and Graham. That gave them another 15-point lead and the Pistons never seriously challenged down the stretch. McDaniels, playing in his fourth NBA game, finished with eight points that included his first two career 3-pointers. ""I'm getting way more comfortable,"" he said. ""I worked hard every day to get here and I'm really confident in my abilities."" One week after scoring a season-worst 10 points in a quarter against the Memphis Grizzles, the Pistons only scored 11 in the first period against the Hornets. Charlotte led 47-37 at the half, holding Detroit to 32.5% shooting and forcing 11 turnovers. ""It's going to be tough to win any game when you keep turning the ball over,"" Brandon Knight said. ""Every one of those is a shot we could have gotten off."" TIP INS Hornets: Bridges grew up in Flint, about an hour north of Detroit, and played at Michigan State. His college career ended at Little Caesars Arena when the Spartans were upset by Syracuse in the 2018 NCAA tournament. . Cody Zeller left in the third quarter with a facial laceration, but returned to finish the game. Pistons: John Henson, acquired at the trade deadline as part of the Andre Drummond trade, hit his first nine shots as a Piston before missing a tip-in attempt in the fourth quarter. ALMOST BACK HOME Knight was playing his first home game for the Pistons since he scored 12 points in a 109-101 win over the Philadelphia 76ers at the Palace of Auburn Hills. That summer, he and Khris Middleton were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Brandon Jennings. ""It definitely brought me back to year one and year two in the league,"" said Knight, who was drafted No. 8 overall in the 2011 draft. ""We're in a different city than we were back then, but it is still Detroit.""","401161435"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Spencer Dinwiddie struggled to find his shooting touch Monday night. He rediscovered it in the nick of time for Brooklyn. Dinwiddie calmly knocked down the go-ahead 21-footer with 5.2 seconds left, then watched as Indiana's final shot come up well short to give the Nets a 106-105 victory over the Indiana Pacers. ""I kept thinking I was going to blow the game because we were playing so well collectively,"" he said. ""I was like, `Come on, man! You can't be the one that blows this thing.' That last shot was different."" It was a strange game for Dinwiddie. He finished 4 of 15 from the field and 0 for 7 on 3-pointers yet made made 13 of 15 from the free throw line, scoring 21 points and dishing out 11 assists. But the only thing that really mattered was Dinwiddie delivering on his last chance in a game Brooklyn controlled for almost the entire first three quarters. The result: Brooklyn earned a rare road victory, beat the Pacers for the first time in three tries this season and now, thanks to Dinwiddie, has back-to-back wins at Indiana for the first time in seven seasons. ""I thought our defense was great in the fourth quarter. We only turned it over twice,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Guys made plays. That's what it all comes down to in the NBA, at the end of the game, you make plays."" For the Pacers, the fourth-quarter breakdowns are becoming a familiar tale. The lead changed hands three times in the final 27 seconds -- with the Nets taking a 104-103 lead, their first of the quarter, on Joe Harris' 3-pointer. Indiana answered with a layup from Domantas Sabonis with 10 seconds left to make it 105-104. But Dinwiddie's basket put the Nets back in front, and Malcolm Brogdon's errant 3 at the buzzer sealed the Pacers' fate, ruining Sabonis' fourth triple-double of the season. Sabonis finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. T.J. Warren added 19 points as the Pacers lost their sixth in a row -- matching their longest skid since February 2017. ""We had a four-point lead there, late. We've got to win that,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""You've got to score and you've got to get stops and we didn't do that, again. It's us, again, not finishing the game."" TIP-INS Nets: DeAndre Jordan had 11 points and 19 rebounds -- the 20th time this season he's had double-digit rebounds off the bench. ... Harris finished with 15 points, Jarrett Allen had 13. Both players grabbed eight rebounds. ... Caris LeVert had 11 points, ending his career-high streak of consecutive 20-point games at three. ... The Nets were 12 of 37 on 3s. Pacers: Myles Turner scored 13 points in the first half, more than he had posted in any game since Jan. 13, and finished with 15. ... Victor Oladipo had 12 points and Doug McDermott wound up with 13, seven coming in a flurry late in the third that gave Indiana the lead. ...

Indiana has lost five straight home games for the first time since January and February 2008. ALL TOGETHER The Pacers had their projected starting lineup intact for the first time all season Monday: Brogdon, Oladipo, Warren, Sabonis and Turner. It didn't help the Pacers change course but McMillan believes that will change soon. ""It's only taken, what, 53 games to get to this point?"" McMillan said. ""But we have a chance now to establish this group and build off that."" IRVING UPDATE Kyrie Irving missed another game with a sprained right knee and it remains unclear when he'll return. Before the game, Atkinson said he didn't have any update on Irving and he's also unsure what he'll do with lineups once the star guard is healthy.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic arent built to shoot their way out of slumps, so know they won't have many nights like they did Monday. Aaron Gordon scored 26 points, Nikola Vucevic had 24 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, and the Magic surged past the Atlanta Hawks 135-126. The Magic, who had lost eight of nine overall and five straight at home, stunned themselves and the Hawks with a 79-point second half that included a season-high 42 points in the fourth quarter. The Magic are 7-0 this season when scoring more than 120 points. When the ball goes through the net like that, its more enjoyable for everyone, Vucevic said. But we cant expect to make shots like that every night. We dont have that kind of firepower. The reality is, were not going to win many games giving up 126 points. But they had it rolling against Atlanta. The Magic hit 52.6% from the field, including a season-high 18 3-pointers, in their highest-scoring game this season. Orlando hit 13 of 25 3-point attempts in the second half and used a pair of 11-0 runs in the fourth quarter to run down Atlanta. Evan Fournier had 22 points and Terrence Ross had five 3-pointers and 21 points off the bench. Markelle Fultz contributed 13 points and eight assists. The way weve been struggling, our guys knew this was an important game, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. And thats the way weve got to play. Its got to be five-man basketball. Atlanta was playing the second half of a back-to-back that started with a double-overtime win over New York. The Hawks held their own for three periods, taking a 96-93 into the final period, but ran out of gas. Trae Young had 29 points and nine assists for Atlanta. John Collins scored 22 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 14 points and nine rebounds off the bench. Back-to-backs have really been an Achilles heel for us, Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. There was nothing we could do. We didnt have enough pressure on their passes, their shooters got hot and thats tough. Back-to-back dunks by James Ennis III finished off the first 11-0 Magic run early in the final period to put the Magic up 106-101 with just over 9 minutes left. Young helped the Hawks close the gap to 116-115, but the Magic suddenly got hot from the perimeter and shot Atlanta out of the game. Fournier started the second 11-0 run with a 20-footer and Gordon finished it with a 3-pointer that gave Orlando 127-115 lead with 3 1/2 minutes to go. Atlanta never got closer than six the rest of the game. TIP-INS Hawks: Collins had his run of scoring 20 or more points and grabbing 10 or more rebounds stopped at five straight games. ... Young took all 11 Atlanta free throws in the first half, making 10. ... Vince Carter, a resident of Orlando, received his second farewell tribute from the Magic during the first quarter. Magic: Ennis made his debut after being obtained from Philadelphia at the trade deadline. He had six points and five rebounds.  Orlando is last in the NBA in shooting percentage at 43.1% and 28th in 3-point shooting at 33.4%.  The Magic received unanimous approval from the City Council to buy land a half-mile from the Amway Arena to build a practice facility. HOW FAR IS TOO FAR? Young was just 3 of 11 on 3-pointers with five of the misses coming from 30 feet and beyond, but Pierce said hes not about to draw the line on how far Young can back up. Hes proven he can make those shots, Pierce said. Sometimes he takes them a little too early for my liking, but were looking for that balance of when to take it and when to execute. Hes capable of getting that shot any time and hes capable of making it.","401161437"
"TORONTO --  Toronto Raptors star Pascal Siakam keeps telling teammate OG Anunoby to improve his offense output by thinking less on the court. Anunoby must not have thought much during Monday's game against Minnesota. Anunoby scored a career-high 25 points and matched his career best with 12 rebounds, Kyle Lowry had 27 points and 11 assists, and the Raptors extended their franchise-record winning streak to 15 by beating the Timberwolves 137-126. ""Most of the time you can kind of see that he's thinking too much and he's not just playing freely,"" Siakam said of Anunoby. ""Every time he just goes out and plays -- once you're open shoot it, you're not open drive it -- he always has a good game. ""You've got to keep it simple, and he did tonight."" Anunoby connected on 10 of 13 attempts, going 3 of 4 from 3-point range, and picked up his fifth double-double of the season. Toronto is 4-0 when Anunoby scores 20 or more. ""I thought his decisions were really, really good tonight,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Siakam scored 14 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had a season-high 21 and Fred VanVleet added 16 as the Raptors won their 16th straight home meeting with Minnesota. Lowry returned after missing Saturday's win over Brooklyn because of whiplash, but center Serge Ibaka sat because of flu-like symptoms. Hollis-Jefferson started for Ibaka. D'Angelo Russell scored 22 points in his Minnesota debut and Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 10 rebounds, but the Timberwolves couldn't build on Saturday's surprise victory over the Clippers that snapped a 13-game losing streak. Russell, who didn't play Saturday because of a right quad contusion, said he had enjoyed his first game playing alongside his pal Towns and the rest of the new-look Timberwolves. ""It was great,"" Russell said. ""Super excited about this group."" Jarrett Culver, Malik Beasley and Juancho Hernangomez scored 15 apiece for the Timberwolves, who have lost five straight against Toronto. Minnesota had a season-worst 23 turnovers, leading to 34 points for the Raptors. ""Your turnovers are as good as 2s and 3s for them, the way they push the ball and the way they can score in the open court,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Toronto wasn't much better at taking care of the ball. The Raptors committed 20 turnovers, four shy of their season-worst total. The Timberwolves scored 26 points off Toronto miscues. Minnesota trailed 106-94 through three quarters but former Raptor James Johnson made two 3-pointers as the Timberwolves opened the fourth with a 12-2 run, cutting it to 108-106 with 9:07 left. That was as close as Minnesota would get. Chris Boucher and Siakam scored to push Toronto's lead back to six points, and VanVleet and Patrick McCaw hit 3-pointers on either side of Towns' free throw to make it 120-109 with 5:28 remaining. Toronto connected on eight straight field goals to begin the game before Hollis-Jefferson missed a hook shot with 8:03 to play in the opening quarter. Lowry scored 14 points in the first and Siakam shot 4 for 4 and scored 10 points as the Raptors led 40-36. Minnesota took its first lead of the game on a layup by Hernangomez with 6:24 left in the second quarter. The Timberwolves led 75-74 at halftime. Anunoby scored 16 points in the third on 6-of-7 shooting, but the basket of the quarter came in the final seconds when VanVleet threw a no-look, overhead pass to Hollis-Jefferson for a fast-break dunk.

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks presented Giannis Antetokounmpo a victory as a baby gift. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe scored 28 points apiece to pace Milwaukee past Sacramento 123-111 on Monday night as the Bucks won without new father Antetokounmpo. Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, missed the game after he and his girlfriend welcomed their first child, which he announced earlier Monday on his Twitter account. ""They are a good team. They are very balanced, they play a really good system,"" said Kings guard Buddy Hield. ""Bledsoe leading the charge tonight, him and Middleton. Giannis was out, but those guys were able to get going. They are tough covers. We got to do a better job just containing them and making things uncomfortable for them but we didn't do that and in the third and fourth quarter and they got it going. "" Milwaukee trailed 90-88 after three quarters, but opened the final period with 13 consecutive points as Sacramento missed its first five shots. Bledsoe capped the run with back-to-back 3 pointers to put the Bucks up 101-90. ""We were saying going into the fourth, whoever starts playing defense, starts getting stops is going to take the game away,"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said. ""That's what that group did who was out there at the beginning of fourth. It fueled us and we continued to ride on that through the whole fourth quarter."" Bogdan Bogdanovic hit two free throws to pull the Kings within 103-97 with 5:58 remaining. Sacramento had a chance to cut it to four, but Middleton came up with a steal and scored on a breakaway jam. ""Khris knocks the ball away, gets the deflection, and then gets out and gets the break,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think it was a six-point game right then and they had the ball and a chance to maybe cut it to four, instead we're back up to eight and feel more confident."" Donte DiVincenzo's 3-pointer pushed the Bucks' lead to 111-100 with 3:35 left. Harrison Barnes had 23 points and De'Aaron Fox added 17 for the Kings, who had won four of their previous five. Lopez added 20 points for the Bucks, who improved their NBA-best record to 46-7. Milwaukee is 4-6 when trailing after three quarters. The Bucks also are 5-0 in games without Antetokounmpo this season. Sacramento, which trailed 38-24 after one quarter, took its first lead at 57-56 on Nemanja Bjelica's layup with 37 seconds left in the half. After making 16 of 31 shots in the first quarter, including 5 of 12 from beyond the arc, the Bucks were just 6 of 21 in their 19-point second quarter. ""We gave ourselves a chance,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""Obviously the start of the fourth quarter really hurt. The start of the game, I just thought we had too many turnovers that were unforced. Sloppy ones, that if you are going to win on the road in the NBA you can't have."" TIP-INS Kings: Forward Jabari Parker, acquired at the trade deadline from Atlanta -- where he missed 20 of his last 21 games with a right shoulder impingement -- was inactive Monday for the third consecutive game with Sacramento. Coach Luke Walton said there is a chance Parker could play Wednesday at Dallas. Bucks: Milwaukee signed veteran forward Marvin Williams on Monday and waived forward Dragan Bender. Williams, in his 15th season, averaged 6.7 points and 2.7 rebounds in 41 games with Charlotte this season. The 6-foot-8 Williams, the second overall pick in the 2005 draft by the Atlanta Hawks, has averaged 10.3 points and 5.2 rebounds over his career.

"DALLAS --  Another perfect night for Rudy Gobert against Dallas didn't feel much like one with a lead slipping away in the third quarter. The Utah Jazz and their 7-foot-1 center found a way to hang on for the win. Jordan Clarkson scored 25 points before fouling out, helping Gobert and the Jazz beat the Mavericks 123-119 on Monday night. Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic scored 23 points apiece, with each hitting key baskets late in the fourth quarter after the Jazz's 21-point halftime lead was whittled to three in the third. ""It's never all going to be perfect,"" said Gobert, who was 7 of 7 from the field after making all eight attempts in Utah's home victory over Dallas last month. ""Some days there's a storm and we got to all come together and finish the game as a team. I think we did a pretty good job doing that when they made a big run."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored a season-high 33 points and Kristaps Porzingis added 28 for the Mavericks in their seventh straight game without injured All-Star point guard Luka Doncic. The second-year sensation, who has a sprained right ankle, could return for the final game before the All-Star break. The Mavericks are 3-4 in their second stint without Doncic, both because of a right ankle sprain. Utah shot 61% in the first half and a season-high 59% for the game, just shy of the highest percentage Dallas has allowed this season. The Mavericks have one of the best road records in the league at 18-8 but dropped to 14-14 at home. They've lost four of their past five at home. ""It's embarrassing,"" Hardaway said. ""We all know that. Everybody's got to get their minds and bodies right to come out here and compete for 48. We're not doing that at home."" Bogdanovic had a pair of clutch 3-pointers a night after the Croatian forward became the NBA's first player with multiple buzzer-beaters this season, hitting a 3 that beat the Rockets in Houston 114-113. Mitchell, who was 8 of 12, connected on a tough turnaround jumper for a late seven-point lead. ""We've been on the wrong end of those, where they come back and take the lead,"" Mitchell said. ""The biggest thing is we weren't like scared. We weren't like, `Here he go again.' How do we fix it and we continued to push forward."" Clarkson was 10 of 17 and had eight assists and five rebounds. He fouled out with four minutes remaining as the Jazz won their third straight game since a five-game losing streak that followed a 19-2 stretch.

TIP-INS Jazz: PG Mike Conley missed the second night of a back-to-back for the second straight time, officially for injury recovery from right knee soreness. The Jazz might rest their 32-year-old starter on the back end of their four remaining back-to-backs. Conley also missed 19 games with a left hamstring strain. ... Emmanuel Mudiay scored 12 points, and Joe Ingles matched Clarkson for the game high with eight assists. ... Gobert has made 17 consecutive shots against Dallas going back to last Feb 23.

Dallas' previous rebounding low was 44. ... Seth Curry scored 15 points. ASSIST OF THE NIGHT Boban Marjanovic, the 7-4 Serb, bailed out the 7-3 Porzingis when his Latvian teammate couldn't poke the ball out with the end of a broomstick when the ball got stuck in the shot clock apparatus behind a backboard. Porzingis failed several times to dislodge the ball before Marjanovic wandered over from the bench and took over to the crowd's cheers. They grew louder when Marjanovic succeeded on his first try. WHISPERING SNYDER Utah coach Quin Snyder barely made it through a brief pregame media session because he was losing his voice. He didn't even try after the game, sending assistant Alex Jensen to talk to reporters.","401161440"
"DENVER --  Jamal Murray was hurting, out of rhythm and wondering if he should keep playing when he left the court at halftime. A quick call to his father gave him the incentive to keep going. San Antonio probably wished the young guard had stayed in the locker room. Murray scored 14 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to help the Denver Nuggets rally from 23 down to beat the Spurs 127-120 on Monday night. Denver scored 74 points in the second half, a season high, and outscored San Antonio by 21 after halftime. The Nuggets have won three in a row and six of their last seven. Murray was playing his fourth game after missing 10 with a sprained left ankle, an injury he's still playing through. It showed in the first 24 minutes, when he scored three points on 1-of-5 shooting. ""I pride myself on playing with pain, playing through stuff. The first half didn't go my way and I got banged up and I just called my dad at half and recouped,"" he said. ""I'm hurting a lot. I've played with so much pain but sometimes I don't want to play through pain no more. Let me just sit it out."" Paul Millsap, who had 22 off the bench, helped spark the comeback on his 35th birthday. He had 16 points in the second half, including a go-ahead 3-pointer early in the fourth. ""They just outworked us in the first half so we needed to bring some type of energy and I wanted to be that spark plug,"" Millsap said. Nikola Jokic had 19 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds while battling foul trouble trying to guard LaMarcus Aldridge. The Spurs forward had 33 points to lead all scorers. The Spurs, on an extended eight-game road trip, have lost the first five despite leading for most of the way. They scored 40 in the first quarter, led 67-53 at halftime and quickly extended it to 22 points. Aldridge, who scored all of his 17 first-half points in the first 10:31 of the game, added seven more to increase the San Antonio advantage to 86-63 lead. The Nuggets mounted a furious rally in the final 3:14 to cut the Spurs' lead to 93-89 after three, and then took their first lead on Millsap's 3-pointer with 9:01 left. ""Paul was great,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""Every time he shot the ball during that stretch I thought it was going in. Most of the time it did."" The Spurs scored eight in a row to go back in front 107-102 but Murray had 11 points to kick-start another rally and give the Nuggets the lead for good. ""Millsap, Murray, they just took over as far as shooting is concerned,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They did a great job, and they're going to keep playing. They're a great team, so they're not going to stop and we just couldn't sustain the scoring."" TIP-INS Spurs: G DeMar Derozan sat out with back spasms. ... Derrick White played his college basketball at the University of Colorado at Boulder. ... Aldridge's season high in points is 40. Nuggets: Forwards Keita Bates-Diop and Jordan McRae, acquired in separate deals last week, made their home debuts. Bates-Diop saw his first action with Denver on Saturday at Phoenix. McRae scored eight points in 17 minutes. ... The 67 points allowed in the first half were two shy of the most Denver has given up this season. PRICELESS EXPERIENCE The Nuggets ended a five-year playoff drought last spring when they faced the Spurs in the first round. Denver survived in seven games before losing a Game 7 against Portland in the next round. ""Can't put a dollar sign on it,"" Malone said of the postseason run. ""So valuable. You had seven of our top nine players making their playoff debut. There are a lot of players who go through their playoff experience and never get a seventh game. All of our young guys got two last year."" BIG FAN Popovich watched Torrey Craig help the Nuggets beat his Spurs last spring and then had a chance to coach him on the USA Men's Select Team last summer. Popovich came away impressed.

"SAN FRANCISCO --  Once Jimmy Butler came back, Miami's longest losing streak of the season was gone. Butler had 21 points and 10 rebounds in his return to the lineup and the Heat won in Andre Iguodala's first game back in the Bay Area, thumping the Golden State Warriors 113-101 on Monday night. ""We look like a totally different team when our max player is out there."" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said of Butler. ""He makes it look a little bit smoother, a little bit more settled with our offense. The ball gets to the right places. He finds a way to get to the free throw line. All these things that are necessary when you want to win on the road."" Butler was crisp after sitting out with a right shoulder strain he suffered against the Clippers on Feb. 5. The All-Star forward scored 13 points in the first half, shot 9 of 15 overall and had five assists to help the Heat end their three-game skid. ""That's what my team needs me to do, be that way on both ends of the floor,"" Butler said. ""We have a couple of new guys that are just as effective as I am. It's really great and it's really fun to go out there and compete with them."" Jae Crowder added 21 points and eight rebounds. Bam Adebayo had 13 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. Kelly Olynyk had 12 points and a career-high 11 assists. Iguodala, a key member of the Warriors' three championship teams from 2015-18, had two points and five rebounds in 17 minutes against his former team. ""I don't know what his plus-minus was but good things happen when he is on the floor, regardless of what happens in the box score,"" Spoelstra said. Damion Lee scored 26 points with five 3-pointers for Golden State (12-42). The loss ends the Warriors' five-year streak of finishing .500 or better. The Warriors were hurt by 17 turnovers. ""It's just a matter of taking out those mistakes,"" Lee said. ""You can't have (17) turnovers and try to beat a team that's top four in this league."" The Heat led comfortably most of the game to win for the first time on their six-game road trip that stretches beyond the All-Star break. Crowder, who had 18 points in his Miami debut against Portland on Sunday, made a step-back 3-pointer that put the Heat up by 18 midway through the second quarter. Olynyk later added another 3-pointer that made it 52-31. Golden State trailed by 24 but got within 73-69 following three free throws by Lee. Miami pulled away early in the fourth quarter, getting a dunk from Iguodala and back-to-back 3s by Duncan Robinson and Crowder. TIP-INS Heat: Crowder scored 16 points in the first half. . Miami won in the Bay Area for the first time since Feb. 12, 2014. The Heat had lost five straight road games to Golden State. Warriors: Thompson and Draymond Green, along with injured teammate Stephen Curry, are among the finalists for the 2020 U.S. Olympic men's basketball team. FAMILIAR FACE, NOW FOE During a brief pregame ceremony, injured Golden State star Klay Thompson introduced Iguodala, the 2015 NBA Finals MVP who was greeted by a standing ovation from the crowd. ""I can't wait to see your jersey in the rafters,"" Thompson said. Iguodala, in his second game with the Heat, tried to keep his return to the Bay Area in perspective. ""I haven't had a chance to let it be something that is overwhelming,"" Iguodala said. ""I just see it as another game on the schedule. It's more important for the team so it's actually helping me, if not allowing me, to not let it seem like a different type of situation."" Iguodala was greeted with a rousing ovation from the crowd when he checked into the game in the first quarter.","401161442"
"LeBron James talks about potentially competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, saying his ""name is in the hat,"" but he'll make his final decision after the NBA season. (0:40) LOS ANGELES --  Rajon Rondo's Los Angeles Lakers teammates have been encouraging him to be more aggressive and shoot the ball instead of trying to distribute it to everyone. On Monday night, he took the advice to heart. The 13-year veteran point guard scored a season-high 23 points, including 15 in the second quarter, as the Lakers rolled to a 125-100 victory over the Phoenix Suns. ""He's always had that confidence but he wants to get everyone involved. We've been on him to shoot those shots and he showed you all what he can do. He does it in practice all the time,"" Anthony Davis said. Los Angeles put the game away in the second, which was only the fifth time in Rondo's 13-year career he has scored 15 or more in a period. ""We dared Rondo to shoot from the perimeter and he made us pay,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. The Lakers had dropped three of their last four at Staples Center but didn't have any problems against the undersized Suns. They outrebounded Phoenix by 30 (59-29) along with a 58-38 advantage in points in the paint. The Suns had only one big man suit up after Deandre Ayton injured his left ankle in Saturday's loss to Denver. Dario Saric and Aron Baynes have also missed extended time due to injuries. Davis had 25 points and 10 rebounds but it was a big game for the bench. Besides Rondo, Dwight Howard had 14 points and 15 rebounds. It is the Lakers' 40th win of the season, the first time since 2010 they have reached that before the All-Star break. ""It was a great game for our bench. Rajon had great pace all night and he was taking all the looks he was getting. Dwight controlled the glass,"" said LeBron James, who had 17 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. Mikal Bridges scored 18 points for Phoenix, which has lost six of seven. Cheick Diallo -- who started in place of Ayton -- added 15 points. Jevon Carter and Ricky Rubio scored 13 apiece. ""It's tough with the size difference and you are missing three rotation bigs. You can always have a plan until the ball comes off the rim,"" said Devin Booker, who had 10 points after going just 2 of 11 from the field. ""When they have three big guys crashing the boards they can still get tip outs."" Both teams started out hot in the first quarter. The Lakers made 10 of their first 13 from the floor and the Suns were 9 of 13 as there were 18 lead changes and four ties in the first 12 minutes. Los Angeles led 31-30 at the end of the first quarter before breaking it open in the second with an 18-4 run as it made eight of its first nine shots. Rondo scored the first eight points in the period, including a pair of 3-pointers. The Suns trailed 61-52 at halftime and got within 63-57 early in the third quarter on Cameron Johnson's 3-pointer. The Lakers scored the next six points and would extend their lead to 27 during the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Suns: Kelly Oubre Jr. came off the bench and scored 10 points. He did not start after missing the team bus. Lakers: Avery Bradley had 12 points and has scored in double figures in five of the last six games. He is also 11 of 15 on 3-pointers over the past three games. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 13 points ...

"Stephen A. Smith explains why Joel Embiid is unhappy in Philadelphia and looks at possible trade destinations for the offseason. (1:23) PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid kept the Philadelphia 76ers close until Josh Richardson took over. Richardson scored 17 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Sixers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 110-103 on Tuesday night. Simmons had 26 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for Philadelphia, which has the NBA's best home record at 25-2. Embiid also scored 26 points, and Tobias Harris added 17 points and 12 boards. In the fourth quarter, I started attacking more, Richardson said. I was reading the defense. Coach put the ball in my hands and gave me the freedom to read it and attack. It's great. I itch for moments like that. In close games, we all want to be part of that positive effort and I had a part of it. Sixers coach Brett Brown credited Richardson's ability to run the pick-and-roll and spell Simmons at point guard for helping the team pull away from Los Angeles. Him being a leader and coming to life has a lot to do with some of those other things, Brown said. Kawhi Leonard led Los Angeles with 30 points, and reserve Landry Shamet scored 19 against his former team. I thought we lost the game because we didn't play with any continuity offensively, coach Doc Rivers said. Richardson nailed his third 3-pointer of the quarter to give Philadelphia a 102-94 lead with 4:44 left. Then he scored on a driving left-handed layup and made the free throw to complete the 3-point play, extending the lead to 11. His free throw made it 110-100 with 1:15 remaining after the Clippers cut the deficit to single digits. We didn't make shots (in the fourth quarter), Leonard said. (Richardson) got to the paint, made some big 3s for them. He made shots. Leonard faced the Sixers for the first time since his quadruple-doink, buzzer-beater knocked Philadelphia of the playoffs last May. Leonard's shot gave Toronto a 92-90 victory in Game 7 and the Raptors went on to win the NBA championship. The Sixers opened the second half with a 16-5 run, taking a 70-59 lead. Simmons, Embiid and Glenn Robinson III combined for 14 of the 16. It's arguably the best game those two have paired up with since I've been here, Brown said of Simmons and Embiid. Simmons took 22 shots, just two short of tying his career best set as a rookie in 2017. Brown moved him around, giving him opportunities away from the ball. I just love being a player. I don't put myself at any one position because I'm so versatile, Simmons said. The Sixers led by 12 in the second quarter after Embiid's reverse layup two minutes in, but the Clippers chipped away. Los Angeles closed out the half with a layup by Williams and pull-up jumper by Leonard to tie it at 54. ALL LOVE Embiid heard some boos mixed in with loud cheers when he was introduced. The All-Star center shushed the crowd and screamed an expletive following a shot Sunday after the team heard boos. He exacerbated the situation with a social media post Monday and a friendly exchange with Jimmy Butler, hinting he might join his former teammate who now plays for Miami. But it was all love for Embiid in the fourth quarter after he and Marcus Morris got into a shoving match. Embiid did a shimmy for fans and got a loud ovation. I could've shushed them again but it was all about having fun, Embiid said. He added: If you dish it, you gotta take it back. But I love my city. We have a special relationship.

"Zach LaVine's winning performance in the 2015 NBA Slam Dunk Contest in New York City.

Bradley Beal scored 30 points, and Washington held off Zach LaVine and the Chicago Bulls for a 126-114 win on Tuesday night. LaVine scored 19 of his 41 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Bulls whittle an 18-point deficit down to six points. His 3 made it 114-108 with 1:54 left, but the Wizards responded with six straight points. ""I thought we kept the pace up,"" said Wizards point guard Ish Smith, who had nine assists and no turnovers. ""Defensively, we did a great job. Zach went a little crazy towards the end, but we did a great job on both ends."" Rui Hachimura added 20 points for Washington, which won for the fourth time in six games. Shabazz Napier and Ian Mahinmi had 15 apiece. LaVine shot 15 of 21 from the field, including 8 for 11 from 3-point range. He is slated to compete in the 3-point contest during the All-Star festivities in Chicago this weekend. ""LaVine makes big shots,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""He made shots that were contested. We try to take it out of his hands (but) he was still able to shoot between the two defenders -- but that's what he does."" Tomas Satoransky added 19 points for Chicago, which enters the break on a six-game losing streak. The Bulls had won four straight versus Washington. ""I thought it took us too long to get our defensive legs underneath us,"" coach Jim Boylen said. The Wizards led by seven at halftime and Beal's 3-pointer capped a quick 9-2 burst to open the third quarter. Four straight points by Mahinmi finished a 10-0 run that gave Washington its biggest lead at 94-73 with 4:17 left in the third.

GOING FOR DISTANCE A two-time winner of the slam dunk competition, LaVine said he'll be competitive in the 3-point contest. ""I'm looking forward to it,"" he said. ""If people think I'm just a high flyer still, I think they are just a casual NBA fan who checks their phone type stuff. I'm not doing it for them. I really ain't doing it for them.

"Zion Williamson says he understands the bigger picture in taking care of his health and having longevity. (1:01) NEW ORLEANS --  Zion Williamson has recorded his first 30-point performance just nine games into his NBA career. Williamson scored 31 points in barely 28 minutes on the court, and the New Orleans Pelicans used a dominant second half to defeat the Portland Trail Blazers 138-117 on Tuesday night. ""I expect to make an impact but I don't expect to do nothing like this,"" Williamson said in his usual, grinning, affable manner. ""I just kind of look to come in, just kind of fit in, just not try to mess up, but my teammates and coaches are always pushing me."" ""I do hold myself to high expectations, but I think it's just finding the line between reality and dreams,"" Williamson added. ""If my teammates find me, they find me. If not, just got to make another play, get the rebound and just play defense."" Williamson used his 6-foot-6, 285-pound frame, quick feet and explosive vertical to have his way with every defender Portland tried against him. Williamson was either too strong, too fast, or both. He mixed spinning dribbles and sudden baseline drives into his usual arsenal of soaring transition dunks and tenacious putbacks. Six of his nine rebounds came on the offensive end. ""I don't really think he's comparable to anyone that I have seen,"" Portland forward Carmelo Anthony said of Williamson. ""Someone who is as powerful as that, who jumps like that ... you can tell he's getting better and getting a feel for the game."" JJ Redick scored 20 for New Orleans, which trailed by as many as 16 in the first quarter before taking command en route to a third straight victory. Josh Hart's 17 points included an alley-oop dunk set up by Williamson's lob in transition. ""It's kind of scary to see how good he is this early,"" Hart said. Jrue Holiday contributed 16 points and 10 assists for New Orleans, while Lonzo Ball added 10 points and 10 assists. Portland star Damian Lillard scored 20 points -- less than half of his 42-point average over his previous 10 games. But his playing time was limited in the fourth quarter when the Pelicans, who led by as many as 26, had put the game out of reach. CJ McCollum had 20 points for the Trail Blazers, and Anthony finished with 18, but just four after halftime. Hassan Whiteside had 17 points and 14 rebounds. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Wenyen Gabriel had 12 points in 13:36 off the bench. ... Anthony was assessed a technical foul in the second quarter for arguing with officials after he had been called for a foul on Williamson's inside shot. Anthony's face and Williamson's arm appeared to make contact on the play. ... Lillard was assessed a technical foul for comments to officials at the end of the first half.

LIMITING LILLARD Holiday was Lillard's primary defender, but had help from big men coming out to the perimeter when Holiday had to run around screens. Holiday ""did about as good as you can do in any situation with Dame,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Our bigs were sensational also. We just tried to always have somebody there when he was about to turn the corner."" TURNING THE TIDE Portland, which like New Orleans is chasing Memphis, looked primed to seize control with a 24-3 first-quarter run that began with a pair of turnaround jumpers by Anthony. McCollum hit a pair of 3s, Whiteside scored on a floater and a hook shot, Anthony dunked and Lillard added a driving layup while being fouled. That put the Pelicans in a 31-15 hole, out of which they gradually climbed during the rest of the first half. Williamson, who had 17 first-half points, helped fuel the comeback. His two-handed dunk of Holiday's alley-oop lob cut Portland's lead to 60-54. Hart and Jackson each hit 3s late in the second period. Holiday added a slashing transition layup through a crowd of converging defenders and Williamson's free throw cut Portland's lead to 65-63 at halftime. New Orleans pushed in front in the third, when Hart scored 12 points on shots ranging from a pull-up in the lane, to a breakaway dunk after his steal, to a left-wing 3. New Orleans scored 41 points in the period alone, leading by 21 when Redick hit his second 3 of the quarter to make it 104-83. ""We gave up a lot of transition. Some of it was them, some of it was us,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said, alluding to New Orleans' 17 fast-break points in the third. ""When we didn't score, they were getting out and running.""","401161446"

Harden, who scored 19 points in the third quarter to help Houston take control, picked up his fifth foul with about eight minutes left. But he was able to stay in the game and avoid fouling out. Robert Covington had 12 points and seven rebounds in his fourth game since he was acquired as part of the four-team trade that sent Capela to the Hawks. The Rockets were up by seven with about eight minutes left when Harden picked up three fouls in about 30 seconds. The Celtics then closed to 96-94 on Brown's 3-pointer and a dunk by Tatum with 5:40 to go.

"CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Cavaliers finally had some fun on their home court Wednesday night. Tristan Thompson scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, Larry Nance Jr. had a career-high 23 points, and the Cavaliers broke a 12-game home losing streak, defeating the Atlanta Hawks 127-105. Cleveland was coming off the worst home loss in franchise history, a 133-92 rout by the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. The Cavaliers won at home for the first time since beating the Hawks on Dec. 23. ""It's a happy locker room again,"" Cavaliers coach John Beilein said. ""It's been a long time in Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse for us to have a happy locker room."" Andre Drummond scored 14 points and had 15 rebounds. Drummond, acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline, has had a double-double in both games with Cleveland. ""I know these guys hadn't won since Christmas,"" he said of Cleveland's home streak. ""It's good we came with so much energy."" Thompson hit three 3-pointers, a career high in a game for the 6-foot-9 center. He participated in a long-range shooting contest with Nance and Drummond during the team's morning shootaround. ""Guards do shooting games in practice, so why not the bigs?"" Thompson said. ""Sometimes you make, sometimes you miss. It's fun. It's good big man competition."" The Cavaliers, who had lost 13 of 14 overall, went ahead midway through the first quarter and led by 23 points in the third. Atlanta cut the lead to nine in the fourth, but got no closer. Nance, starting in place of the injured Kevin Love, had 12 rebounds. Collin Sexton, who was added to the Rising Stars roster this week, had 23 points. Trae Young scored 27 points and had 12 assists for the Hawks, who rallied after trailing 86-63 midway through the third quarter. Atlanta's All-Star guard was 8 of 17 from from the field. John Collins scored 23 points and rookie Cam Reddish had 16. The Hawks (15-41) are trying to hold off the Cavaliers (14-40) for the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Both teams played their final game before the All-Star break. ""Everybody is thinking about where they're going and when their plane is going to leave (for the break), so it happens sometimes,"" Young said. The Cavaliers had highlight-reel plays that brought Cleveland's bench players and the crowd to their feet several times. Thompson added a personal flurry in the second quarter. He hit 3-pointers from the top of the key on back-to-back possessions and ran upcourt with his arms in the air. He drove into the lane and finished with a resounding dunk the next time down the court. Drummond later dribbled upcourt after grabbing a rebound, passed to Darius Garland, who made an underhand lob pass to Nance for a dunk. Thompson added another 3-pointer in the closing minutes. Rookie Kevin Porter Jr. scored 18 points Hawks center Dewayne Dedmon made his first start since being acquired from Sacramento on Feb. 6, but was limited to 18 minutes and had four fouls. TIP-INS Hawks: Dedmon's return moved C Damian Jones to a reserve role. ... C Clint Capela (plantar fasciitis) and F Skal Labissiere (left knee) were out. Cavaliers: Love didn't play because of a sore right Achilles. Beilein said he slightly injured the Achilles last week and played with the soreness Sunday. ...

HALL OF FAME SALUTE Hawks forward Vince Carter, likely playing his final game in Cleveland, was given a long ovation during a photo presentation on the video board before the second quarter. Carter waved to the crowd and pointed to Cleveland's bench, exchanging hugs with several players. SIMPLE EXPLANATION Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce got right to the point when asked about what happened to his team. ""Their effort was great and ours wasn't,"" he said. ""Not a pretty game. They just played harder than us.""","401161449"
"With Aaron Gordon returning to the slam dunk contest, take a look back at his top highlights from the 2016 contest. (1:39) ORLANDO, Fla. --  Aaron Gordon and Markelle Fultz saved the Orlando Magic from going into the All-Star break with an embarrassing loss. Gordon scored 25 points and Markelle Fultz added 21 as the Magic rallied to beat the Detroit Pistons 116-112 in overtime on Wednesday night. The Pistons came back from a 22-point deficit before losing their fourth straight. Gordon, who also had nine rebounds and nine assists, hit two 3-point shots, the second of which tied the game 103-all with 1:03 left after Detroit had taken a seven-point lead. ""The last seven games I think he's averaging about 20 (actually 19.6). I think it's his best stretch, and his defense has been good. It's a good sign,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""I know when I play well, the team plays well. It's kind of a given,"" Gordon said. ""But we've got a long way to go to be a team that can win in the playoffs."" The Magic (24-31) stand eighth in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break. Fultz had 10 assists and two steals and scored the Magic's first and last points in overtime. Christian Wood had 26 points and 12 rebounds for the Pistons, who shot themselves back into the game but scored only four points in overtime. ""Turnovers,"" said coach Dwane Casey. ""We were fighting the shot clock instead of attacking with pace. They made simple plays down the stretch and we tried to make things too complicated."" A 3-pointer by Nikola Vucevic gave Orlando a three-point lead with 5.5 seconds left before Detroit's Reggie Jackson hit a 3-pointer with 1.4 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. The Pistons fell behind 47-25 after committing nine turnovers in the first quarter. But Wood and Markieff Morris scored 11 points apiece to help Detroit outscore the Magic 30-12 over the final seven minutes of the first half. Tony Snell's 3-pointer pulled the Pistons even, 75-75, with 5:30 left in the third quarter. Orlando regained a six-point lead by the end of the period, but the Magic missed their first 11 shots of the fourth quarter. Three-pointers by Svi Mykhailiuk, Jackson and Morris gave the Pistons nine straight points, and Jackson's jumper with 5:25 left gave Detroit a 98-91 lead. Gordon scored eight straight points to help Orlando erase that deficit in the final 3 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Pistons: Derrick Rose played 17 minutes after missing five games with a hip injury. ... F Luke Kennard (knee) and G Khyri Thomas (foot surgery) are hopeful of returning after the All-Star break. Magic: C Mo Bambo had the flu and did not play. ... G D.J. Augustin (knee) expects to play after the All-Star break. ... At 24-31, the Magic are one game better than last season after 55 games. ROUGH RETURN FOR ROSE Rose, who had a stretch of 14 straight games with 20-plus points before getting injured, attributed his 1-for-13 shooting to rust. ""Rhythm, timing,"" he said. ""Same shots I was getting (before the injury) so I'll just go into the break and work on my game every day.""","401161450"
"Toronto coach Nick Nurse explains how the Raptors have been able to succeed after the departure of Kawhi Leonard. (1:17) NEW YORK --  The Toronto Raptors were hoping to keep rolling right into the All-Star break. Instead, they had their franchise-record winning streak stopped at 15 games with a 101-91 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. Still, the reigning NBA champions are 40-15 despite losing Kawhi Leonard last summer and battling injuries all season, so they could easily shrug off a poor performance Wednesday. ""In the big scheme of things, you look at the overall of where you're sitting and have to be pleased with that,"" coach Nick Nurse said. The Raptors couldn't find the form that helped them average 121.2 points and shoot 50% over the previous 15 games. This time, they hit only 37.8%, with Kyle Lowry's triple-double coming on a night when the All-Star point guard was just 4 for 13. ""We didn't play well. Simple as that,"" Lowry said. ""They played well and give them credit, they played their butts off. They beat us. It's only one game."" Caris LeVert scored 20 points for the Nets, who ended a six-game losing streak against the Raptors. That included Saturday in Toronto, where LeVert scored a career-best 37 points but the Nets fell 119-118. ""I think we felt like we were right there in Toronto. We were really a last second tip-in from winning the game and we were confident going into it,"" forward Joe Harris said. ""Obviously any time you play home in front of your own fans, you definitely get a distinct advantage that way"". Harris added 19 points and Spencer Dinwiddie had 17 points and nine assists for the Nets, who head into the break 25-28 after having Kyrie Irving for just 20 games. He sat out again with a sprained right knee. Serge Ibaka had 28 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors after returning from a one-game absence with flu-like symptoms. Fred VanVleet scored 22 points and Lowry had 12 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. The Nets extended a 10-point lead after three quarters to 80-65 in the opening 90 seconds of the fourth and spent the rest of the game turning back every Toronto attempt to get back in it. The Raptors' best shot came when Ibaka made a 3-pointer and VanVleet converted a three-point play to cut it to 91-82 with 4:13 remaining, but LeVert made consecutive baskets to quickly push the lead back into double figures. ""I thought our physicality, the things we were missing in the last two games against them, I thought we just raised that. We wanted it bad,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""The execution wasn't perfect, but our will to win was at a super-high level. That's why we came out with the W."" The Nets scored the first seven points of the second quarter to open a 30-19 lead. The Raptors had the deficit down to six in the final minute of the period, but Harris made three free throws and then a 3 to make it 52-40 at halftime. ""I thought we were a little flat early and just couldn't really get it going after that,"" VanVleet said. ""It is what it is. We weren't going to win them all."" TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto had won 10 straight on the road. ... The Raptors lost for the first time since Jan. 12 against San Antonio. Nets: Brooklyn has won five straight at home. All were by double digits, matching a franchise record. ... LeVert has averaged 24 points in his last five games. MISSING MARC With center Marc Gasol still sidelined by left hamstring tightness, the Raptors were overwhelmed by the Nets' center tandem. Jarrett Allen had 10 points and 13 rebounds, while backup DeAndre Jordan also had 10 rebounds. STREAK STOPPING Toronto's 15-game run was the longest winning streak ever snapped by the Nets.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Malcolm Brogdon flipped the script Wednesday night. Rather than watch another late lead slip away, the Indiana Pacers guard found his finishing touch. Brogdon thwarted Milwaukee's charge with a nearly perfect fourth-quarter performance, helping the the Pacers hold on for a 118-111 victory while snapping a season-worst six-game losing streak. ""I think my teammates rely on me and I think the past five game games I haven't been doing my job, calming the game down, finishing the game,"" he said. ""But tonight, I felt more like myself. My teammates trusted me with the rock."" Brogdon made it pay off, too, with a rare victory over his former team which just happens to have the best record in the league. He finished with 17 points and matched his career high with 13 assists, but saved his best for the final quarter when he scored 10 points, recorded five assists and making all four of his free throws. Numbers only told part of the tale. As Milwaukee methodically cut a 25-point first half deficit to five early in the fourth, it seemed another game might get away from the Pacers. But Brogdon scored on back-to-back baskets and found Jeremy Lamb for a layup. When the Bucks made it 90-86 with 8:18 to go, Brogdon found Lamb and T.J. Warren for back-to-back 3-pointers and closed out the 10-0 run by making two free throws and a 14-foot runner to give Indiana a 100-86 lead with 6:19 to go. Game over. ""I remember saying in the huddle, at the end of the day, you know it's a game of runs we've just to go finish the game,"" two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo said. T.J. Warren led the way with 35 points as the Pacers ended a five-game home losing streak and a four-game skid in the series against the Bucks. Yes, it helped that reigning league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo missed his second straight game following the birth of his first child. And the Pacers' fast start didn't hurt, either. The difference this time: Indiana steadied itself when the Bucks got within 82-71 at the end of the third quarter and opened the fourth with six straight points before Brogdon became the closer. ""We kept fighting,"" Donte DiVincenzo said after leading the Bucks with 19 points. ""We had guys come in at the end and kept that energy high."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had a five-game winning streak snapped and lost its first game against a Central Division foe this season after winning the first 11. ... The Bucks fell to 5-1 in games Antetokounmpo has missed this season. ... George Hill (strained left hamstring) and Kyle Korver (sore back) also missed the game. ...

OLADIPO UPDATE Oladipo came in averaging 10.8 points, shooting 29.5% from the field and 23.1% on 3s. Unexpected? Not really. But coach Nate McMillan said the Pacers will use the All-Star break to contemplate how best to use Oladipo when Indiana returns to action. ""We've already made one adjustment when he went from coming off the bench to starting,"" McMillan said. ""We'll look at how he's playing, how he's feeling and figure out if we need to adjust his role after the break."" Oladipo went 5 of 7 from the field and 1 of 2 on 3s on Wednesday. ""He's been out more than a year. You can't expect him to be the Victor of old in two weeks,"" McMillan said.","401161452"
"New York Knicks brand consultant Steve Stoute explains that the focus of the team is to hire a new president and head coach who can restore a winning culture. (1:57) NEW YORK --  Bradley Beal was not selected for the All-Star Game this weekend. His performance against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night showed he deserved the nod. Beal scored 30 points and led the Washington Wizards' fourth-quarter surge in a 114-96 win over the Knicks. ""I love playing here. I think we all do,"" Beal said. ""It's the Garden, you just automatically get hyped."" Davis Bertans added 16 points, Isaac Bonga had 13 and Troy Brown Jr. scored 11 as Washington closed out the victory with a 34-19 run. The Knicks were within 80-77 following a jumper by Kevin Knox with 9:16 left in the game. But, Washington went on a 24-8 run that included 10 points by Beal. That lifted the Wizards to a 104-85 lead that eventually reached 20 points twice. The Wizards have won five of their last seven games and are only three games behind Orlando in the race for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. ""We're in a good spot,"" Beal said. ""We can make a lot of noise coming out of the break."" Julius Randle led the Knicks with 21 points and 13 rebounds. Elfrid Payton scored 19, RJ Barrett added 16 and Mitchell Robinson had 11. ""He's (Beal) a great player who came in here and did what he needed to do,"" Mitchell said. ""I feel like he should've been in it (All-Star Game). He's played well the whole season."" The Wizards led by one, 25-24, after the first quarter. Back-to-back baskets by Moe Harkless gave the Knicks a 28-27 lead to open the second. But, Washington went on to take a six-point lead, 36-30, on a 3-pointer by Bertans with 8:50 remaining. Beal's layup gave the Wizards another six-point lead with just under three minutes left, before the Knicks closed out the half on a 10-0 run to go ahead 50-46 at the break. ""We had a shaky end of the second quarter, but bounced back and did a much better job in the second half,"" Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said. ""I knew the shots were going to fall sooner or later."" Barrett's free throws gave the Knicks a game-high six-point lead to open the second half, but the Wizards countered by scoring the next eight points. That started a 16-3 run, giving them a seven-point lead, 62-55. New York responded by scoring eight straight points and retaking the lead for the final time. Beal's three-point play stopped the streak and Washington went up by as many as six points before settling for a 77-73 lead at the end of the third quarter. Bonga's 3-pointer with 26 seconds left in the game gave the Wizards their final 20-point advantage, 114-94. ""They went on a run. They were just better than us in that stretch,"" said Barrett, who went 0 for 4 from long distance as the Knicks shot just 13% (3 of 23) from behind the arc. ""Nothing much you could do about that."" TIP-INS: Wizards: Washington has beaten New York in 11 of the last 12 meetings at Madison Square Garden. The Wizards' only loss to the Knicks during that stretch was on April 7, 2019. Overall, the Wizards have won 20 of the last 24 games between the teams. . Washington did not commit its first foul of the game until 8:33 remained in the second quarter (Moritz Wagner). Knicks: No one was listed on the Knicks' injury report for the first time all season. The team's healthy scratches were Kadeem Allen, Ignas Brazdeikis, Allonzo Trier, and Kenny Wooten. . Harkless made his Knicks debut following his trade from the Clippers and finished with four points, five rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes. FOLLOW THE BOUNCING BALL With 9:02 remaining in the game, Shabazz Napier hoisted up a long-distance shot after Washington called a timeout. Bobby Portis grabbed it before it hit the rim, and as Shabazz turned to walk toward his bench, Portis threw the ball at Shabazz's back and was ejected. LAST MEN STANDING Only one player on each team has been on the floor for every game this season. Portis has played in all 55 games for New York (four starts), while Ish Smith has been in all 53 for Washington (16 starts).

The change will bring a new coach and new coaches that are going to develop these younger players."" ""I don't really have a reaction to it,"" Miller said. ""I found out about it from someone else after the fact, and didn't really have a reaction to it. (Right now I'm) locked in and doing what we do here.

"Damian Lillard says he's disappointed to miss the All-Star Game but knows his health comes first as the Trail Blazers try to make a push to the postseason. (1:11) MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies cushioned their lead for the final playoff spot in the West on a night when Portlands Damian Lillard injured his groin. Brandon Clarke matched his career high with 27 points, Ja Morant had 20 points and nine assists as the Grizzlies went into the All-Star break with a 111-104 victory over the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Clarke scored consistently at the rim on lobs off the pick-and-roll. He connected on 12 of 14 shots, part of Memphis outscoring Portland 76-34 in the paint  a category in which the Grizzlies lead the league. The guards just did a really good job at finding me. They made my job really easy, said Clarke, who entered the game shooting 61.4%, tops among rookies and fourth in the league overall. All I really had to do was run to the rim hard and jump up and catch a lob dunk. So, Im really thankful for those guards. DeAnthony Melton and Jonas Valanciunas scored 12 points each, with Valanciunas also grabbing 18 rebounds. CJ McCollum led the Trail Blazers with 23 points, and Lillard added 20 on a tough shooting night as he went 7 of 19 from the field before leaving with 3:22 left. Lillard took a foul against Jaren Jackson Jr. and immediately walked off the floor and headed to Portland's locker room. Lillard said after the game he suffered a right groin strain and added the injury will prevent him from taking the court in the All-Star Game. I dont think Im playing in the game. I know Im not playing, Lillard said, later adding: It made no sense to be out there for the last few minutes (against Memphis) and risk trying to play through it and make things worse. It almost happened with perfect timing (coming at the All-Star break), so we will see. The Trail Blazers lost their second straight and enter the break four games behind the Grizzlies for the final spot in the Western Conference playoff race. Its clich, but weve got to worry about one game at a time, Portland coach Terry Stotts said of overcoming the deficit for the postseason. Memphis built the lead in the second half to double-digits, eventually stretching it to 14. Portland, playing the second night of a back-to-back after a loss at New Orleans on Tuesday, could never overtake Memphis. A disappointing two-game trip, Stotts said. I dont know if fatigue came into it with six games in seven nights. It was a tough stretch. For the Grizzlies, the win meant being two games over .500 and having a bi of a buffer for the stretch run. It means a lot, especially going into the break, Morant said of the victory. Playing against a team were fighting for the eighth spot, its a big win for us, especially on our home court. But Lillard said Portland will use the break to recover and prepare for the final 25 games. Its far from over, the Trail Blazers guard said. Believe that. ... Dont think that was just it. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Mario Hezonja and Nassir Little were out (left ankle sprains). That was in addition to Zach Collins (left shoulder dislocation), Rodney Hood (left Achilles tendon rupture) and Jusuf Nurkic (left leg fracture). ... Lillard has scored at least 20 points in 21 straight games. ... Stotts challenged a goaltending call against Hassan Whiteside with 5:24 left and the call was overturned, cutting Memphis' lead to 100-90. ... Whiteside got his second technical foul in the closing seconds and was ejected. Grizzlies: Gorgui Dieng entered late in the first quarter, his first appearance with the Grizzlies since being acquired in a trade deadline deal. He became the second Senegalese native to play for the franchise, joining Makhtar NDiaye (1998-99). ... Valanciunas recorded his 26th double-double of the season. It was his second straight game with 18 rebounds. ... The 76 paint points matched a season high recorded against Denver on Jan. 28. PLAYOFF PICTURE With the victory, the Grizzlies have extended their margin over Portland for the eighth spot in the West. The game was an important win for Memphis. The teams only play three times this season, and the next two are in Portland: March 12 and April 5. So, the Grizzlies win gave them a game up in the tiebreaker.","401161454"

Miles Bridges added 20 points as Charlotte won its second consecutive game ahead of a seven-day layoff. That after a stretch when the Hornets lost 13 of 14. ""Big,"" Graham said. ""Different feeling. Everybody's happy, smiling. We can feed off of this, especially going into break, coming back."" Bismack Biyombo had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Hornets, who rallied from a double-figure deficit to spoil D'Angelo Russell's home debut with Minnesota. Charlotte's rally from 18 down was sparked on the defensive end. The Hornets held Minnesota to 42 second-half points on 30% shooting. ""We had to ramp up our physicality,"" Biyombo said. ""Communication got better, physicality got better, our ball pressure got better. We were rebounding the ball a little bit better in the second half than we did in the first half. So overall, we were talking to each other. Communication was there. That's really what got it done is our intensity."" Russell had 26 points and 11 assists for the Timberwolves, who played without Karl-Anthony Towns but led for most of the first three quarters. Towns has a left wrist injury that will be further evaluated during the All-Star break. ""You give teams like that some momentum and you don't respond to adversity and it's hard to win in this league,"" Russell said. ""Hard to get the confidence back."" Hornets guard Terry Rozier missed the game with left knee soreness. The Hornets trailed by 18 in the first half. They cut into the lead with a 15-5 run to start the third quarter. A 12-2 run to open the fourth gave them their first lead since 2-0. Bridges scored 17 points in the second half, Monk had 16 and Graham scored 15. Graham hit a 3-pointer with 54 seconds left to ice the victory. ""It's a strong win for us,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said.

"DALLAS --  Before heading to the All-Star game to play with his basketball idol, Luka Doncic returned from injury to test a pairing that's a lot more important to the Dallas Mavericks sensation. The 20-year-old Slovenian and fellow Euro star Kristaps Porzingis will want to keep this up after the break. Doncic had 33 points and 12 rebounds after missing seven games with a sprained right ankle while Porzingis chipped in 27 points with 13 boards, leading the Mavericks to a 130-111 win over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. An All-Star starter set to play for LeBron James' team in his second season, Doncic added eight assists in the NBA triple-double leader's final game before going to All-Star weekend in Chicago, where he also plans to play in the rising stars game. Porzingis will be waiting when he gets back after thriving like rarely before in their first season together, and after the 7-foot-3 Latvian recorded a career-best three consecutive games with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds with Doncic out. ""It's just getting better and better,"" Doncic said of the pair playing together. ""It's good when we both have those nights."" Buddy Hield scored 22 points and De'Aaron Fox added 16 for the Kings, who fell behind for good in the second quarter and were never closer than 11 points in the second half. ""For some reason, we didn't feel the need to try to play much defense tonight,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""We couldn't stop their top guys and when we did, it just didn't feel like we had the passion and desire that it takes to win, especially on the road, in this league."" Doncic didn't need long to find a groove, scoring 17 points in the first half with eight rebounds and five assists, including a no-look pass in transition to Maxi Kleber for a dunk. Porzingis, who had five assists and three blocks, was 11 of 16 from the field with an emphatic dunk in transition that pushed the Dallas lead past 20 for the first time at 89-68 late in the third quarter. ""The playmaking and the communication and the eye contact between them throughout the game offensively was fantastic,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""KP mixed rolls, pops. Luka was driving, stepping back. And they were playing great off each other. That's a great thing to see, particularly headed into the break."" It's the second time Doncic has missed games with a sprained right ankle. He was out four games in December after getting hurt early in a loss to Miami, then re-injured the ankle in practice late last month. ""It was a quiet 33. It really was,"" Carlisle said. ""He really kept everyone involved and picked his spots and was very efficient with his field goal attempts. That's the sign of a great player that can do that."" Kent Bazemore scored 15 points and hit a 3-pointer that briefly put the Kings ahead in the second quarter after they trailed by 12 less than nine minutes into the game. TIP-INS Kings: Walton said the club decided to wait until after the All-Star break for Jabari Parker's return from a right shoulder injury. Parker has missed 24 of the past 25 games. ... Marvin Bagley, drafted one spot ahead of Doncic at No. 2 overall in 2018, missed both games in Dallas. He was out for the 11th straight game with left foot soreness. Bagley has been limited to 13 games this season. Mavericks: Dallas will wait until after the break for the debut of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. The No. 2 pick from the 2012 draft signed with the Mavericks after taking a buyout in Charlotte. ... Dallas' win was just the second in the past 10 games for the home team in the series. CAROLINA VISITOR North Carolina coach Roy Williams sat courtside near the Mavericks bench, making the trip to Dallas to see Doncic a day after the Tar Heels lost at Wake Forest. SHARE THE BALL The Mavericks finished with 34 assists, one off their season high. While Tim Hardaway scored 19 points, he chipped in six assists. Seth Curry matched that total while making all three of his 3s and scoring 18. ""The ball moved freely all night long, which was really good to see,"" Carlisle said. HIELD'S YIELD Hield was 4 of 12 from 3-point range in his last game before participating in the 3-point contest in Chicago. ""It's a good time to get away, just relax, clear my mind, go there and compete and try to win it,"" he said.","401161456"
"PHOENIX --  Suns guard Devin Booker was serenaded with chants of All-Star! All-Star! in the final seconds Wednesday night as he hit two free throws that sealed his team's 112-106 win over the Golden State Warriors. Despite the crowd's insistence, Booker isn't an All-Star just yet. That could change very soon. Booker scored 27 points on the same night that Portland's Damian Lillard injured his groin. Lillard said after his game that he won't play in the NBA All-Star Game this weekend in Chicago, opening the door for Booker to possibly be an injury replacement. Booker was widely viewed as one of the biggest snubs when the All-Star reserves were announced this month and the high-scoring Phoenix guard wasn't chosen. Lillard mentioned Booker -- who came into Wednesday averaging 26.4 points per game -- as a worthy replacement after his injury. That means a lot, Booker said of Lillard's endorsement. I've always said that respect from my peers is my main focus and goal in this NBA. At the same time, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. I don't know the criteria or what happens next, so I guess we'll wait and see."" Phoenix won for just the second time in eight games and goes into the All-Star break with a 22-33 record. The Suns have already surpassed last season's total of 19 wins. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 15 points against the Warriors, and Mikal Bridges scored 14. Phoenix led 87-76 after three quarters and never trailed in the fourth. The Warriors pulled to 110-106 on a 3-pointer by Andrew Wiggins with 45 seconds left, but Damion Lee missed a 3 on the next possession that would have cut the deficit to one. Golden State has lost four straight and goes into the break 12-43, the worst mark in the NBA. The Warriors have struggled all season after losing star guards Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry to injuries. They dropped this one despite shooting 51% from the field. Golden State was hurt by 22 turnovers. Wiggins led the Warriors with 27 points on 9-of-14 shooting. Mistakes. Mistakes all over the place. Disappointing, coach Steve Kerr said. We did a lot of good things, but you cant overcome 22 turnovers and giving up 32 points off of those turnovers. Phoenix had a 58-50 halftime lead. Booker led the Suns with 18 points in the first half, while Marquese Chriss had 12 for the Warriors. Chriss played the first two seasons of his career with the Suns before being traded to the Rockets in 2018. CURRY PROGRESSES Curry is taking part in some of the non-contact portions of practice as he works back from a broken left hand, such as offensive 5-on-0 stuff, Kerr said. The Warriors plan another medical update for the two-time MVP on Feb. 28. Curry has said he hopes to play next month as planned if all goes well. Hes coming around, Kerr said after shootaround earlier Wednesday. Right now everythings going smoothly and hes just trying to build his conditioning base and trying to keep getting better. Theres not a specific date for when Curry will return to contact drills. SPECIAL TRIP Kerr trekked to Tucson on Tuesday night to visit with his Arizona college coach, Lute Olson. Its always still special for Kerr to return to the desert, where the former Suns general manager posed for post-shootaround photos with about a dozen ASU athletes from different sports earlier Wednesday. Always enjoyed coming back to Phoenix to play and just in Arizona in general, Kerr said. Its just special to come back here, always great to come back during the winter when the suns shining and get outside and smell the desert air. Its a beautiful place. TIP-INS Warriors: Chriss finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds. He shot 7 of 11 from the field. Suns: Phoenix signed forward Jonah Bolden to a 10-day contract. Bolden played 26 minutes for the short-handed Suns, scored six points and grabbed seven rebounds. The 24-year-old previously played two seasons with the 76ers, including 44 games during the 2018-19 season. ... C Deandre Ayton missed his second straight game with left ankle soreness.","401161457"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Facing Miami's tough zone defense a second time, the Utah Jazz finally figured it out. The Jazz balanced patience and aggression. They attacked the rim and kept the ball moving as much as possible to prevent getting bogged down and forcing bad shots. The result was a 116-101 victory over the Heat on Wednesday night. ""There is a point in the game where you can either go one of two ways,"" guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""We just wanted to attack, put the pressure on and keep it going. You can get teams on their heels and you can kind of relax and let them kind of gain the momentum back."" Mitchell did his part to press the attack. He scored 26 points on 9-of-16 shooting while getting it done inside and out. He shot over 50% from the field for a second consecutive game. ""I made it a focus just to keep getting to the rim and putting pressure on the rim,"" Mitchell said. Bojan Bogdanovic added 22 points and Jordan Clarkson chipped in 21 points off the bench for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 20 rebounds as Utah won its fourth straight game. Jimmy Butler scored 25 points to lead the Heat. Duncan Robinson added 18 points and Jae Crowder chipped in 15 off the bench. Miami capped off its five-game road trip with a 1-4 record. ""Nobody wants to go 1-4 on the road trip, but it doesn't take the eternal optimist to see there's some good things going on in this locker room,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We'll get this thing right, get our game together for this final push. It should be exciting."" Miami built the largest lead during a back-and-forth first half. Butler, Kendrick Nunn and Robinson each scored a basket during an 8-0 run that put the Heat up 52-43. Utah closed the gap in the third quarter and overtook Miami. Gobert tipped in a basket and Mitchell drove for a layup on back-to-back possessions to spark a 18-7 run. The Jazz scored on seven straight possessions during the run -- capped by a layup and pair of free throws by Tony Bradley for a 79-72 lead. ""We were just tougher mentally in the second half,"" Gobert said. ""They're a very physical team and I feel like in the first half we were complaining a lot. ... They were being more physical than us."" Robinson and Crowder drained back-to-back 3-pointers and Crowder added a pair of free throws to pull Miami within two at 87-85. Clarkson kept the Heat from regaining the lead, hitting a pair of 3-pointers less than a minute apart as part of a 9-0 run. The second 3-pointer gave Utah a 96-85 lead with 8:08 remaining. Miami never got closer than seven points. After Andre Iguodala hit a 3-pointer to cut the Jazz lead to 106-99, Utah scored on four consecutive possessions, punctuated by a dunk by Gobert that made it 116-101 with 1:31 remaining. ""We're not a bad team, but we're not where we wanna be at just yet,"" Butler said. ""That's OK. I think, moving forward, we just continue to get better, and figure out a way to win games, especially on the road."" TURNING BACK TURNOVERS Miami's zone flustered the Jazz offense early. Utah committed five turnovers within the first nine minutes and had given up 14 points on nine turnovers by halftime. That changed in the second half. The Jazz committed six turnovers over the final two quarters. Utah gave up zero points off those turnovers. One thing that changed was the Jazz became more precise with passing and ball movement in the second half. Too many first half passes were off-target, even when they weren't turnovers and slowed down the ball. That was not a problem after halftime. ""Our guys have done a better job of trying to recognize where the turnovers are coming and correcting it,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""That's the primary thing. I want us to stay aggressive."" TRIPLE THREAT Robinson made at least five 3-pointers for the fourth straight game for Miami after going 6 of 13 from the perimeter. He has knocked down 191 3-pointers while shooting 43.8% from outside. His percentage ranks best among the top 10 NBA players in made 3-pointers this season. TIP INS Heat: Crowder has made 12 3-pointers in three games since being acquired by the Heat. He has shot 60% from the perimeter during that stretch. . Bam Adebayo finished with a team-high 11 rebounds. . Miami held the Jazz to three fastbreak points. Jazz: Gobert blocked his 100th shot of the season in the first quarter. He has at least 100 blocks in each of the last six seasons. . Joe Ingles dished out a team-high nine assists. . Utah outscored Miami 16-0 in second-chance points through the first three quarters.","401161458"
"DENVER --  LeBron James wasn't about to coast into the All-Star break, and neither was Anthony Davis. ""I could tell they were locked in pregame. LeBron had his jersey with like 80 minutes to go before the game,"" guard Alex Caruso said after the Los Angeles Lakers' 120-116 overtime triumph in Denver on Wednesday night. James posted his 12th triple-double of the season, tied with Luka Doncic for the NBA lead, and Davis scored seven of his 33 points in overtime as the Western Conference leaders took a 41-12 record and a four-game lead over second-place Denver into the All-Star break. ""I was trying to be laser sharp, laser focused as I could,"" James said. ""I know the break was coming, but I wasn't going to take this opportunity for granted. I wanted to play extremely well tonight for our ballclub and I wanted us to play extremely well going into the break on a high note. And our team, we responded very well."" The Nuggets were the hottest team in the league, having won six of seven, including short-handed stunners at Milwaukee and Utah. So, James, who had 32 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds, saw this as playoff prep. ""Every opportunity we get to play in a close game against a tough opponent, it's a learning experience for all of us,"" he said. ""It prepares us for a postseason game where it's going to be back and forth, back and forth. I thought tonight was a playoff atmosphere for both teams, being No. 1 and No. 2 in the Western Conference, jockeying for position. We were just trying to make plays whatever it takes. And A.D. was there knocking down big 3s and getting a block and getting some stops, the jump ball, as well. It was big time."" In addition to his 33 points, Davis tied up All-Star Nikola Jokic for a key jump ball late in regulation when the officials had to waive off the basket by Denver's big man after he muscled the ball away from Davis and into the basket. Jokic has 22 points and 11 rebounds for Denver, which saw its four-game winning streak snapped. Dwight Howard added 14 points for the Lakers, who improved their NBA-best road record to 23-5. Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with 33 points, but Jokic was in foul trouble late and made some crucial blunders in the extra period, including a turnover on a bad pass with 19 seconds left after he passed up an open 3-pointer with Denver down 119-116. The back-and-forth game went to overtime tied at 111 when James' fadeaway 15-footer hit the iron and bounced away at the buzzer. Gary Harris' 3-pointer tied it at 116 with 3:06 remaining in overtime, but the Nuggets suddenly went cold, especially Jokic, who missed three shots and bypassed a wide-open 3 with 20 seconds left and the Nuggets down 119-116. He followed with a bad pass right into the arms of Kentavious Cadlwell-Pope. ""It was a close game. We just didn't execute in the last minutes,"" Jokic said. ""I made a lot of terrible mistakes. Every decision was bad. So, I need to be better with my decision-making. I think I just need to look to shoot a little bit more."" NO RUNAWAY LA opened the second half with a 3-pointer by Danny Green and a thunderous dunk by James for an 11-point lead, the Lakers' largest of the night. But the Nuggets used an 11-0 run capped by Jokic's long 3-pointer to tie it at 66. Jokic picked up his fourth foul and went to the bench with 4:44 left in the third quarter. The Nuggets vehemently argued the call because Davis took three steps in the paint before contact and should have been called for a travel. But his teammates picked up the slack to give the Nuggets an 87-84 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Jokic returned with Denver trailing 97-94 with 7 1/2 minutes left in regulation. James' jumper put Los Angeles ahead 53-51 and his drive to the hoop with one-tenth of a second left gave the Lakers a 61-55 halftime lead. SILVER LINING Despite the disappointment, the Nuggets are pleased to take a 38-17 record into the All-Star break. ""Of course nobody wants to lose, but we lost to an amazing team,"" said Jokic, who was battered after 37 minutes of having James, Davis and Dwight Howard come at him in waves. ""They are one of the best teams in the NBA right now. They are playing at a really high level. It's not a bad thing to lose against them, especially because it's overtime and we put up a fight."" And Denver was without the injured trio of Mason Plumlee, Michal Porter Jr. and Will Barton III. ""We are still second,"" Jokic said, ""so I like it."" TIP-INS Lakers: Took control in the second quarter by outscoring Denver 20-8 in the paint. ... The Lakers forced Denver into a pair of 24-second violations, including on the game's first possession. Nuggets: Jokic was honored for his All-Star selection in a pregame ceremony that included a framed All-Star jersey. ... Reserves Paul Millsap, Monte Morris and Noah Vonlieh each sank their only 3-point attempt of the first half, whereas the starting five went a combined 3 for 10 from long range.","401161459"
"BOSTON --  Jayson Tatum didn't want to smile. But sometimes the moment calls for it. The Celtics were trailing 124-123 in the final minute of overtime in their back-and-forth slugfest with the Clippers and Tatum found himself defended by Landry Shamet and Montrezl Harrell. Tatum hesitated, sidestepped Shamet, then spun around Harrell for a layup. As the crowd cheered around him, Tatum led out a loud yell, flexing his arms. The play didn't win the game and gave Tatum just two of the 39 points he scored in Boston's thrilling 141-133 double-overtime win on Thursday night. But it's the latest sign that the first-time All-Star is getting more comfortable as a go-to player. I did get a little excited, Tatum said. I try to be as calm as I can and try to keep a poker face and move on to the next play. But basketball is a game of emotions and the crowd was into it."" Marcus Smart added 31 points and Gordon Hayward finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds. Kemba Walker had 19 points and nine rebounds. Tatum and Smart combined for 16 of Boston's 27 points in the overtime periods. The Celtics have won seven straight at home and eight of their last nine overall. The Clippers played most of the game without Paul George, who left in the second quarter with a left hamstring strain. Lou Williams led Los Angeles with 35 points. Kawhi Leonard had 28 points and 11 rebounds, and Harrell finished with 24 points and 13 rebounds. George played 15 minutes, scoring four points on 2-of-7 shooting before heading to the locker room. The first meeting between the teams on Nov. 20 was also decided in overtime. The Clippers held on for a 107-104 win. The Celtics took a 134-130 lead in the second OT on a driving layup by Smart and another by Tatum. ""Hes more assertive,"" Leonard said of Tatum. They are trusting him and he is trusting himself. Harrell got a dunk on the Clippers' next trip up the floor. But Hayward responded with a 3 to increase Boston's lead to 137-132. Tatum was called for an offensive foul, but Hayward blocked a runner by Williams off his body to force the turnover with 55 seconds left. Hayward hit four free throws in the final minute to help close it out. Tatum said he left the court feeling relief. I'm just happy we won,"" he said. That would have been tough playing that hard as a team and not coming out with a victory. The All-Star break comes at a perfect time for both teams as they try to get healthy. Clippers guard Patrick Beverley missed his fourth straight game with a sore right groin. The Celtics played without Jaylen Brown, who has a left calf contusion. Smart started in place of Brown and scored the Celtics' first 10 points, digging them out of an early 7-0 deficit. Smart and Tatum combined for 24 of Boston's 30 first-quarter points. It helped offset a 15-point opening period by Leonard. Boston limited Leonard to two points in the second quarter but had no answers on the inside for Harrell, who had 16 points in the first half on 5-of-5 shooting from the field. Clippers coach Doc Rivers said he likes his team's position heading into the break. We're good, Rivers said. We've had a first half of the season where basically we've had more starting lineups than anybody in the league. Our record's pretty solid. We gotta get healthy. That's the key for us. We gotta get healthy. TIP-INS Clippers: Had a 65-19 advantage in bench scoring. Celtics: Tatum and Smart had all 13 of Boston's points in the first overtime. BACK AND FORTH A 3-pointer by Marcus Morris gave the Clippers a 122-118 lead in the first extra period. But the Celtics responded and took a 125-124 lead when Tatum split a pair of defenders for a layup with 53.8 seconds left. Leonard missed a short jumper and Tatum scored again off feed from Walker with 24.8 seconds remaining. Landry Shamet tied it again with a 3-pointer, giving the Celtics the ball back with 21 seconds left. Tatum got off a 27-footer but came up empty. CELTICS TO RETIRE GARNETT'S JERSEY During the game's first timeout, the Celtics surprised fans with a video presentation to announce Kevin Garnetts No. 5 will be retired during the 2020-21 season. It will hang in the open space next to the No. 34 of teammate Paul Pierce, who alongside Garnett led Boston to its most recent title in 2008. Pierce's jersey was retired by the Celtics in 2018. Garnett, in his first year in eligibility for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, is expected to be on the list of finalists when it it is unveiled during NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago.","401161460"
"NEW ORLEANS --  The veteran savvy of Danilo Gallinari and Chris Paul helped Oklahoma City withstand the latest stirring performance by Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson. Gallinari scored 11 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, Paul had 14 points and 12 assists, and the Thunder beat New Orleans 123-118 on Thursday night. Down the stretch, thats when we feel like were at our best,"" Paul said. It was Gallo tonight. He was killer. Williamson set his new single-game scoring mark with 32 points for New Orleans, his second straight game scoring more than 30, but Gallinari's clutch shooting kept the Pelicans at bay. New Orleans, which trailed by as many as 13 points in the third quarter, rallied behind Williamson's dominant inside play to take several slim leads inside the final six minutes. But after Lonzo Ball's corner 3 gave the Pelicans a 111-110 lead, Gallinari hit a fall-away in the paint and followed up by rattling in a 3. He added free throws and a left-wing pull-up in the final minutes, the last making it 121-115 with 30 seconds left. They just have a way of hanging in games and closing them, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. They made plays down the stretch and we just didnt. Dennis Schroder scored 22 points for the Thunder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 17 points. Thunder center Steven Adams capped his 11-point, 11-rebound, three-block night with a clutch jumper in the paint that made it 119-114. We had a lot of guys step up in different moments, Thunder coach Billy Donvan said. ""We found a way to make enough plays there at the end. JJ Redick scored 24 points for the Pelicans, who saw their three-game winning streak snapped in a compelling, highlight-filled contest that saw 22 lead changes and 12 ties. Both teams shot better than 48%, but New Orleans was done in by 17 turnovers that the Thunder converted into 24 points. Oklahoma City committed just nine turnovers. With a leader like Chris Paul, hes facilitating their offense and they were hitting shots, and we just had self-inflicted turnovers, said Williamson, who committed three turnovers. For much of the game, Williamson delighted the crowd on both ends of the floor. He rejected Abdel Nader's floater in the paint with a volleyball-style spike out of play. His dunks included one on a putback and another on an alley-oop feed from Frank Jackson. Paul had nine of his assists in the opening two quarters, the last of those coming in a rather unusual way. Paul unloaded the ball to Adams in the back court in the final seconds of the half, and Adams hurled the ball right into the hoop from 56 feet. The shot, which gave the Thunder a 66-58 lead, was the first 3-pointer of Adams' career. He celebrated it with a brief, smiling shimmy before jogging with teammates toward the tunnel to the locker room. TIP-INS Thunder: Have won 15 of their last 18 road games. ... Oklahoma City's bench has outscored opponent reserves in 41 of 55 games this season. ... Shot 50% (46 of 92) and went 13 of 27 from 3-point range.

Outrebounded Oklahoma City 46-40. ... Went 14 of 35 from 3-point range. ... Williamson, slated to play in the NBA All-Star weekend future stars game, has scored at least 20 points in eight of his first 10 NBA games and reached 30 twice. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT Adams was amused by his half-ending 3 from beyond half-court because he'd made a similar shot to win a half-court shooting competition at the end of practice a day earlier. I ended up winning that one because I did exactly the same shot,"" Adams said. ""As you could tell, I was pumped. After the shot went in, I kind of blacked out. I kind of seen what I had done. I was doing a shimmy. I dont know. Alter ego coming out, mate. Adams, now in his seventh season, came in 0 for 9 in his career from 3-point range. His first make from deep also resulted in one of the most unlikely of Paul's 9,542 career assists. Our team is a very fun, together team.

"DETROIT --  Like many NBA coaches, Mike Budenholzer was worried about his Milwaukee Bucks needing a game or two to get back up to speed after the All-Star break. It wasn't a concern for long Thursday night. The Bucks had 70 points by halftime on their way to a 126-106 victory over the Detroit Pistons. ""That was a really impressive first half and I thought we did a lot of good things in the second half, too,"" Budenholzer said. ""Our energy had been good the last two days, but that doesn't always equate to good play. There were a lot of positives for the first game after the break."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 16 rebounds as the Bucks led by as many as 34 points in the second half. Detroit trailed 70-41 at halftime and could never get enough stops to mount any significant rally in the final two quarters. ""We came out and played our game and played with pace and aggression,"" said former Piston Khris Middleton, who scored 28 points. ""That's how we have to play the rest of the way."" Eric Bledsoe added 19 points for the Bucks, who won for the 15th time in 17 games. Brook Lopez scored 18. The Pistons have lost five straight since trading Andre Drummond to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Feb. 6 and were playing for the first time since buying out Reggie Jackson's contract. ""With a young team, it takes getting smacked upside the head a few times to wake them up a little bit,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""Tonight showed everyone how far we still have to go when it comes to building our roster and developing our young players."" Christian Wood, one of seven players in the game who has played for both teams, had 18 points and 11 rebounds. Bruce Brown finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds. ""`Those guys are like family, but once we touch the court, it is for blood,"" Wood said. ""I'm going to go right at Giannis and he's going to go right at me."" The game was lopsided early, with the Bucks leading by 14 at the end of the first quarter and 29 at the half. Detroit's 41 first-half points were only two more than Middleton (20) and Antetokounmpo (19) had on their own. ""It was big to come off the break and play good basketball and be up by almost 30 at the half,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We picked up right where we left off."" Milwaukee also had a 14-0 advantage in points off turnovers, many coming after Pistons drove into the lane before throwing away an attempted kick-out. ""That's the No. 1 team in the league when it comes to protecting the paint, so you have to have a plan before you get in there,"" Casey said. ""They have such unbelievable length that once you get in there, everything closes up in a hurry. You either have to get to the rim or know where you are passing the ball."" TIP INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo was called for a technical for arguing a third-quarter call with Milwaukee leading by 29. ... The win meant the Bucks still haven't lost back-to-back games this season. Pistons: Detroit had two former Bucks, Tony Snell and Thon Maker, in the starting lineup and three more (Wood, Brandon Knight and John Henson) on the bench. Middleton started his career with Detroit and Ersan Ilyasova has also played for the Pistons. NEWEST BUCK Marvin Williams played the final 8:41 in his second game since joining the Bucks after being bought out by the Charlotte Hornets. Budenholzer said he left a few of his starters in the game to get them time alongside Williams. ""It was fortunate that he got to play a lot of the starters group, but we'll figure out what he's going to do on a night-to-night basis,"" he said. ""He's going to help us."" BIG POSSESSION The Bucks had a chance at a 7-point possession in the third quarter, thanks to Wood committing a flagrant foul on a made basket. Donte DiVicenzo finished the three-point play and Antetokounmpo added a free throw after a technical on Pistons coach Dwane Casey. Because of the flagrant foul, the Bucks retained the ball, but Antetokounmpo was called for an offensive foul.","401161462"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young didn't attribute his first 50-point game to confidence gained from his first All-Star start. Belief in himself has never been a problem for the high-scoring guard with a fondness for 30-foot jumpers. Young had a career-high 50 points and the Atlanta Hawks scored the last 10 points of the game to beat the Miami Heat 129-124 on Thursday night. Young made 18 of 19 free throws and 8 of 15 3-pointers to set his scoring high in his first game after starting in the NBA All-Star Game. ""I've always had confidence in myself,"" Young said when asked if he was boosted by the All-Star Game experience. Young scored 20 points in the final period. ""A big game from our leader,"" said Atlanta's John Collins. ""... We got some big plays from our big-time guy."" The Heat had no answer for Young's barrage of 3-pointers, many from well beyond the line. ""He just got into such an incredible rhythm,"" said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. ""He's pulling up from six feet behind the line. ... There's not a lot of things you can do about that."" Bam Adebayo had 28 points and a season-high 19 rebounds for Miami. Adebayo, the NBA All-Star skills champion, added seven assists. Miami couldn't hold a 124-119 lead. After De'Andre Hunter's tying 3-pointer, Cam Reddish scored with 31 seconds remaining following his steal from Goran Dragic to give the Hawks a 126-124 lead. Young's two free throws increased the lead to four points. Kevin Huerter and Hunter each scored 17 points for Atlanta. Young hit a jumper for Atlanta's first field goal of the final period. On the Hawks' next possession, Young's crossover dribble had Andre Iguodala on his heels, and Young then sank a long 3-pointer for a 97-all tie. ""He's shooting 50-footers,"" Adebayo said. ""At the end of the day you've got to live with that."" With Hawks fans still buzzing after watching Young's knee-buckling fake on replays during a timeout, Iguodala answered with back-to-back baskets, including a 3-pointer, as Miami reclaimed the lead. Young wasn't finished. He kept the Hawks close by scoring 14 of Atlanta's first 18 points of the final period. Young's three-point play tied the game at 119-all. Miami led 36-32 after the first period before a shooting drought in the second quarter as Atlanta took the lead with a 15-0 run. After trailing 41-37, Atlanta led 52-41 after the run, capped by Hunter's 3-pointer. TIP-INS Heat: Fresh off winning the All-Star dunk contest, Derrick Jones Jr. was replaced in the starting lineup by Jae Crowder. The move was part of a roster adjustment with C Meyers Leonard (left ankle sprain) held out. Hawks: Young's previous high mark was 47 points at Indiana on Nov. 29. ... C Clint Capela (plantar fasciitis) has started some shooting practice and his recovery will be evaluated in two weeks. Capela and F Skal Labissiere (left knee) were acquired at this month's trade deadline. Labissiere also will evaluated in two weeks. ... Huerter's status was in doubt until pregame warmups following his allergic reaction to a meal. SLUMP FOR HEAT Miami has lost five of its last six games. ""We'll figure it out,"" said Jimmy Butler, who had 17 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. ""We've got nothing but time. ... I'm confident in our group."" ROAD WOES Miami is 22-3 at home but fell to 13-17 on the road. ""We've just got to win on the road,"" Adebayo said. ""Plain and simple."" Spoelstra blamed the defense after the Hawks made 16 of 35 3s and 48.2% of their overall field goal attempts (41 of 85). ""We have to focus in on closing games out and doing it on the defensive end,"" said Crowder, who had 14 points.","401161463"
"Ben Simmons is blocking out the noise of his critics and elevating his game to new heights this season. (1:39) PHILADELPHIA --  A few weeks before the All-Star break, Joel Embiid said he wasnt having much fun on the basketball floor this season. Embiid was back to his old self Thursday night, flapping his arms to the crowd, smiling from ear to ear and taking over a game at critical moments. Embiid had 39 points and 16 rebounds, Alec Burks and Shake Milton added big baskets in overtime and the Philadelphia 76ers extended their dominance at home with a 112-104 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Having fun means a lot of things, Embiid said. This year, I havent been smiling as much as previous years. That doesnt mean Im not having fun or that everything is not going well. Its about playing basketball the right way. I feel like the first part of the season, I was trying to make sure that everyone was comfortable. But if were going to go somewhere, Ive got to be one of the guys and that starts on defense and playing hard, doing the little things. Playing without All-Star point guard Ben Simmons because of lower back tightness, Philadelphia improved its record at the Wells Fargo Center to 26-2. The 76ers are 9-19 on the road. Tobias Harris added 22 points and 12 boards for the 76ers. Burks had 19 points, including a pair of layups in overtime that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Caris LeVert scored 25 points and Spencer Dinwiddie had 22 for Brooklyn, which announced before the game that Kyrie Irving would have season-ending surgery on his right shoulder. Obviously, Embiid is one of, if not the best center of the league, Dinwiddie said. He does his job on both ends of the floor. And tonight, he did his job and got his team a win. It was a night of extended runs that started with Philadelphia breaking out of the gate to a 22-6 lead, only for the Nets to follow with a 44-8 stretch that helped them to a 52-42 halftime lead. It could have been worse for the Sixers if not for a 12-2 closing run. The run we had at the end of the first half to get it back to 10 was big, Embiid said. We were able to get some momentum in those moments."" Embiid started to assert more of a presence early in the second half, controlling the game from the paint and helping the Sixers get within 78-77. When you go to the All-Star Game and other All-Stars come to you when its crunch time at the end of the game, theres no greater boost than that, 76ers coach Brett Brown said. And his defense, his energy and his passion were contagious tonight for the other four players. Dinwiddie hit a fadeaway jumper with 30 seconds left in regulation to give Brooklyn a 103-101 lead, then fouled Embiid at the other end with 16 seconds to play. Embiid hit both foul shots to even the score and Brooklyn played for the last shot, but Wilson Chandlers layup at the rim after a pass from Dinwiddie was knocked away by Embiid just as the horn sounded to send the game to overtime. After Dinwiddie hit one of two free throws to give Brooklyn a 104-103 lead, the 76ers went on a 9-0 run with Burks hitting two running layups and Milton converting a pass from Harris in the lane into an easy basket. TIP-INS Sixers: Simmons played in Sunday nights All-Star Game in a reserve role for LeBron James squad. Simmons is officially listed as day-to-day. In his place, Raul Neto started at the point guard spot. It is the third game this season that Simmons has missed. He injured the AC joint in his shoulder in November and missed two games. Nets: With the loss of Irving, the Nets will have to make a run to the playoffs with a starting lineup of Joe Harris, Taurean Prince, Jarrett Allen, LeVert and Dinwiddie. I think our players have done a great job with that, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game. I dont think they feel anything like that at all. They look at is as a challenge and an opportunity to do something special. Ive been so pleased with the spirit and attitude. The spirit is really good in there and I think these guys want to surprise some people. WORKING ON HORFORD Al Horfords adjustment to life coming off the Philadelphia bench was rocky on Thursday night. Horfords initial entrance came just as Brooklyn started its 44-8 run, where the 76ers forward appeared flat-footed against Brooklyns smaller lineup. Horford,in the first year of a four-year, $110 million contract, scored six points, grabbed three rebounds and the 76ers were outscored by 26 points in his 18 1/2 minutes.","401161464"
"CHICAGO --  Devonte Graham failed to score for the first time this season. Even with their star guard held without a point, the Hornets had enough to beat the Bulls. Malik Monk scored 25 points, Miles Bridges added 22 and Charlotte hung on to beat cold-shooting Chicago 103-93 on Thursday night. ""It showed that everybody can step up at any moment,"" Monk said. ""It showed that we trust in each other. Everybody is able to step up at any time, to step up in the big times."" After the NBA put on a memorable show last weekend with the All-Star festivities in Chicago for the first time since 1988, the Hornets and Bulls delivered a rather forgettable performance. The Hornets let a 21-point lead in the third quarter shrink to two. But they regrouped to win their third in a row after losing five straight and 13 of 14. The Bulls missed their first 17 3-pointers before Zach LaVine made one in the third quarter and were 7 of 31 from beyond the arc in losing their seventh straight game. Graham, making a strong case for the NBA's Most Improved Player Award, had not scored fewer than four points this season. He missed all seven shots but contributed seven assists with the Bulls consistently trapping him. ""With them, it's next man up,"" Chicago's Thaddeus Young said. ""They had other guys step up. I think we did a good on just showing him traps. You stop one guy, he becomes a basketball player and makes smart decisions. He makes different reads and that's what they did."" P.J. Washington scored 17 points for Charlotte. Cody Zeller added 16 points and eight rebounds. Bridges also grabbed eight rebounds after taking MVP honors in the Rising Stars Challenge at the United Center during All-Star weekend. ""We're not built around one player,"" Hornets head coach James Borrego said. ""We have depth, we have versatility, and ultimately that's how we want to be built."" Thaddeus Young led Chicago with season highs of 22 points and 11 rebounds. LaVine scored 19 points. ""We have a lot of season left,"" LaVine said. ""You've got to stay locked in. This is our job. This is a dream job. This is something that millions of people wish they could do -- good or bad. It's a tough situation. Nobody likes being in a losing situation. But you get to see who's fighting with you and who's not. Go out there and battle."" REGROUPING The Hornets led by 21 early in the third, only to have Chicago's Coby White cut it to 70-68 with a three-point play with 3:05 left in the quarter. Bridges answered with a finger-roll layup, and Terry Rozier got the lead back up to double digits early in the fourth when he nailed a 3 to make it 89-78. ""Dug in, showed resiliency, could have hung our heads,"" Borrego said. ""We've had a few of those games in the past where we've hung our heads. We've had big leads, we've lost it. This fourth quarter was different though. There's maturity out there, guys are talking, communicating, playing for each other."" TIP-INS Hornets: G Dwayne Bacon scored 51 points Wednesday for the Greensboro Swarm in his first game after being assigned to the G League. ""The G League has been really good to us. We've gained a lot of experience and a lot of confidence with our guys that go to Greensboro, and this is a great example of that,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. Bulls: C Daniel Gafford (dislocated right thumb, sprained right ankle), playing for just the second time since Jan. 15, finished with five points and four rebounds. ... Young's previous highs were 21 points against Toronto on Feb. 2 and 10 rebounds against Philadelphia on Feb. 9.","401161465"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Five days after winning the 3-point competition during All-Star weekend, Buddy Hields free throw shooting made the difference for Sacramento and has the Kings pondering a potential late run at the postseason. That might be a lofty aspiration for a team still 11 games under .500, but Hield wants his teammates to embrace it as much as possible. Harrison Barnes scored a season-high 32 points and matched his career high with seven 3, DeAaron Fox added 26 and Sacramento beat the Memphis Grizzlies 129-125 on Thursday night. ""No matter what you have to try to start this second part of the season with a win,"" Hield said. ""Every game is a must-win and (we) have to play every game like our back is against the wall if we want to make things interesting, and we can."" Hield, who joined Peja Stojakovic as the only Kings to win the NBA's 3-point contest, added 20 points, including four free throws in the final seconds. Its fun, Hield said of his clutch free throws. Its what you live for, to be in that situation for your team. Kent Bazemore scored 18 as the Kings won their fourth straight against the Grizzlies at home. DeAnthony Melton scored 24 and Ja Morant had 19 for the Grizzlies. Memphis trailed by 15 early in the fourth quarter but took advantage of Sacramentos struggles at the free throw line and caught a break when Melton was fouled by Barnes attempting a 3-pointer with 7.5 seconds remaining. Melton made all three free throws to pull the Grizzlies within 125-124. After Hield sank two free throws for Sacramento, Morant made one then intentionally threw the second off the front of the rim but was called for a lane violation. Its just one of those games where we couldnt keep up with the runs until the fourth quarter. Thats where we came up with some big stops, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. We had great production from a lot of different guys off the bench to help us when we may have been struggling from that starting group. Hield made two more free throws to seal the win for the Kings. We were playing some pretty good basketball before we left, so to come out and see that our guys came back locked in ready to go to me shows how theyve been all year long, Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. Theyre going to keep playing hard, theyre going to keep fighting, keep trying to get better. The Kings looked fresh coming off the All-Star break, particularly Barnes. Sporting a much more noticeable beard that he intends to keep until Sacramento gets to .500 or the season ends, Barnes made his first four shots and eight of 10 while going 6-for-6 on 3s in the first half, including a buzzer beater that made it 70-61. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis is winless in Sacramento since Dec. 31, 2017.  The Grizzlies are 8-2 when Kyle Anderson starts. Anderson had 12 points and five rebounds.  Jaren Jackson Jr. scored eight straight in the third quarter. That matched his total against Portland in the final game before the All-Star break. Kings: Jabari Parker had a rough debut in Sacramento after being acquired from Atlanta in exchange for Dwayne Dedmon. Parker missed his first five shots and scored four points.  The 70 points matched a season-high for a half. The Kings put up 70 in the second half against the Spurs on Feb. 8. GOOD CHALLENGE Sacramento led 117-113 when Fox was whistled for his fourth foul. After Walton challenged the call and it was overturned, Fox made a step-back 3-pointer. GILES DEFENSE Harry Giles has been getting more playing time for the Kings and came up big in the fourth quarter with a pair of blocked shots. He also took a charge that helped stop Memphis momentum. He gives us a toughness and an edge when hes playing that way, Walton said. He deserved and earned to be on the court at the end. He was good tonight.","401161466"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  Russell Westbrook vowed to better control his emotions down the stretch of the regular season. They sometimes get the better of him and he realizes he's under the watchful eye of referees because of his reputation, but he won't ever back down. James Harden had 29 points and 10 assists, Westbrook added 21 points and 10 assists before being ejected, and the Houston Rockets beat the cold-shooting Golden State Warriors 135-105 on Thursday night in the teams' first game back from the All-Star break. Things got testy with 6:04 to play when Westbrook tussled with several Warriors, including bumping Damion Lee but ""it wasn't on purpose."" After a replay review, Westbrook received his second technical of the night and was ejected. ""I'm always the one that gets painted to be a bad guy in the whole situation,"" Westbrook said, hinting he might review his technicals to see whether he has a case to get one rescinded. ""... I'm in a position of like, `Oh well, Russ is being Russ,' which nobody knows what that means. But I've got to do a better job of holding myself accountable to a very, very high standard. I will make sure I leave no room for error to allow somebody and people to paint me out to be a guy that I'm not. I think it's unfair that after all that I'm the only one that gets a tech or kicked out. That's not fair"" P.J. Tucker scored 15 points. He made all five of his 3-pointers as the Rockets knocked down 25 total -- a franchise record allowed by the Warriors. Houston set an NBA record with 27 3s in a win against the Suns last April. Robert Covington added 20 points as the Rockets ran away with this one early after losing 116-104 at Chase Center on Christmas Day. Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points in the Warriors' fifth straight loss and also their fifth consecutive at home. Draymond Green dished out seven assists after getting nine in each of his previous two games. ""He's one of those guys people have said he's overrated now for a couple years,"" coach Steve Kerr said of Wiggins. ""He's become underrated."" The Rockets, missing guard Eric Gordon for a third straight game with a bruised left leg, raced to a 16-4 lead. Westbrook was hit with a technical foul at the 7:38 mark of the first quarter, when the Rockets made 8 of 12 3-pointers to take control. Harden shot just 6 for 16 from the field -- 3 of 12 on 3s -- but made 14 of 15 free throws. Golden State started 5 of 16 and missed its initial 11 3-point attempts. When Jordan Poole finally connected from deep with 4:52 left in first half, Houston already had 13 3s. THOMPSON UPDATE Klay Thompson will not play the rest of the regular season as has been the plan all along, though the Warriors said it definitively before the game. Thompson tore the ACL in his left knee last June 13 during the deciding Game 6 of the NBA Finals against Toronto and had surgery July 2. He was re-evaluated over the All-Star break and the team said Stephen Curry's Splash Brother is expected to be ready to go for training camp in late September. ""It's been a very frustrating year for Klay but I think he's almost out of the woods,"" Kerr said. ""He's a couple months away from this season ending and him moving toward a summer of preparing for the next season with his teammates, so I think that's a much better place for him to be emotionally."" An update on Curry's recovery and progress from a broken left hand is planned for Feb. 28 and he expects to be back on the court in March. TIP-INS Rockets: Coach Mike D'Antoni hopes Gordon could be back as soon as Saturday at Utah. ... Houston has won the last two season series against Golden State after losing three straight. ... The Rockets have won seven of the last 10 in the series after losing 11 of 12 from February 2014 to March 2017. ... The Rockets also have won four of five on the road against the Warriors after dropping five of the previous six. ... Houston is 10-10 on the road vs. the Western Conference. Warriors: Wiggins notched his fourth straight season reaching 100 3s. He has scored in double figures for a career-high 65 straight games, all 46 this year and four with the Warriors since joining Golden State in a trade from Minnesota. ... The Warriors were looking to sign Dragan Bender to a 10-day contract, with Kerr noting, ""It's trending that way."" ... Rookie Poole scored in double figures for a career-best fifth straight game. ... The Warriors stuck with their same starting lineup coming out of the break. Kerr has used 27 different starting rotations already, tied for the most in his six seasons with the 27 he used in 2017-18. ... Golden State plays at Houston in the teams' final meeting April 2. SMALL BALL A NECESSITY D'Antoni chuckled as he explained Houston's small-ball approach when asked about how he used to decide when to go big or small. ""I don't have to worry about that now,"" D'Antoni said. ""I couldn't make that decision so I decided to just give me no choice. You're assuming we have a strategy, we're going to play small. We don't need to go big. Our team is better this way and if we're going to dive in we might as well go all the way in.""","401161467"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  All-Star Luka Doncic did his usual thing in Orlando and got some unexpected help from teammate Maxi Kleber. Doncic nearly had a triple-double, finishing with 33 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, and the Dallas Mavericks cruised past the Magic 122-106 on Friday night. Kleber added a career-high 26 points off the bench as the Mavericks improved to 19-8 on the road this season. They won just 18 road games the last two seasons combined. ""I probably never had a night like that in the NBA,"" said Kleber, a 6-foot-10 forward from Germany playing his third season in the league. ""I didn't really even notice. It just sort of happened."" Kristaps Porzingis chipped in 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Tim Hardaway Jr., scored 16 points. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 28 points. Nikola Vucevic had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and Terrence Ross scored 19 points for the Magic, who were doomed by another dismal shooting night. Orlando made just 9 of 43 attempts from 3-point range and shot just 39% from the floor. ""We had a bunch of open shots the whole game,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""What's better than a wide-open shot? You've got to make them."" The Magic trailed by 18 in the first half, but surged ahead behind Fournier's 18 points in the third quarter. The shooting guard hit four of his first five shots to spark a 17-4 run in the first 5 minutes of the second half. His driving, baseline layup gave Orlando its first lead of the game, 69-68. That one-point advantage lasted one possession and turned out to be Orlando's lone lead of the game. Porzingis drained a 12-footer to put Dallas back in front, and the Mavericks extended the lead to 91-84 by the end of the period. Kleber scored 12 points in a little over 3 minutes early in the fourth to help the Mavs pull ahead 107-93. The forward from Germany hit three straight 3-pointers and finished his run with a three-point play that started with a rousing dunk. The Mavericks never let the Magic get closer than 11 the rest of the game. Doncic had 24 points, five rebounds and five assists in the first half, which Dallas controlled throughout. Doncic, Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr., combined to hit 8 of 13 3s, while Orlando made just 3 of 22 from beyond the arc before the break. Kleber ended up making 3 of 6 from behind the 3-point-line. ""It's great having 7-footers who can shoot,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said of Kleber. ""The boost he gave us in the fourth quarter was huge. It gave us some separation and allowed us to bring the game home."" ARMSTRONG HONORED An emotional Darrell Armstrong was inducted into the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame. Now an assistant coach with Dallas, Armstrong worked his way through the USBL, CBA, overseas stints in Cyprus and Spain before catching on with the Magic and playing nine seasons in Orlando. He's the only player in NBA history to win Sixth Man of the Year and Most Improved Player in the same season. ""He's the greatest underdog story in Magic history and one of the greatest in NBA history,"" Magic CEO Alex Martins said. Armstrong broke down crying several times during the ceremony.

"WASHINGTON --  In his first game in charge of the Cleveland Cavaliers, interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff wanted to see grit and fight from his team. Those traits showed up in the fourth quarter. Collin Sexton scored 14 of his 25 points in the fourth and the Cleveland Cavaliers rallied to beat the Washington Wizards 113-108 on Friday night. The physicality they played with,"" Bickerstaff said. ""The toughness, guys diving on the floor, the multiple effort plays at the rim to finish the game down the stretch. Thats who we want to be and the reputation were trying to build. Cedi Osman added 16 points and Darius Garland had 15 to help the Cavaliers win back-to-back games for the first time since Jan. 9-11. After those wins, they lost 13 of 15 heading into the All-Star break, resulting in first-year head coach John Beilein's resignation. Andre Drummond added 12 points and 12 rebounds, Tristan Thompson had 10 points and 11 rebounds and the Cavaliers took control in the fourth quarter after not leading at all during the first three. That duo also each blocked two shots, part of a defensive effort that held the Wizards to 21 points in the final period after scoring 41 in the first. That helped Cleveland overcome 22 turnovers. The guys, what we keep talking about, their willingness to compete on the defensive end of the floor, Bickerstaff said. We had an opportunity. Bradley Beal had 26 points for Washington on 9-for-28 shooting. He was 1 of 10 from 3-point range on a night the Wizards shot 24% (9 of 37) from long range and 39% (41 or 106) overall. Rui Hachimura added 17 points as the Washington returned from the break with a loss after entering winning five of their last seven. Down the stretch, they made some shots and we missed some shots, said Ish Smith, who had only five points on 2-of-12 shooting for Washington. And sometimes its that simple. Trailing nearly the entire game and by as many as 16 early, the Cavs turned it around with a 20-4 run during the fourth quarter. They pulled into their first tie on Thompsons alley-oop dunk. After Beal hit two foul shots, Garlands 3-pointer from the left elbow gave Cleveland its first lead with 6:29 left. Sexton hit another 3 from the top of the arc to complete the run, making it 107-99 with 4:07 left. It was tough at first, Sexton said. Just coming off the break I needed my legs so I had to change up a little bit my shots and stuff. I just took what the defense gave me. I didnt try to force anything. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Porter Jr. was ejected in the third quarter after receiving consecutive technical fouls while protesting a charging call.  Porters ejection ended his career-best streak of double-digit scoring at seven games. ... Drummond received his ninth technical foul and first since joining the Cavaliers in a trade from Detroit earlier this month with 2:42 remaining in the first half. Wizards: With his first steal, Beal reached 600 for his career. He remains seventh in franchise history. Wes Unseld is sixth with 628.  C Thomas Bryant played his first minutes since Feb. 3 after missing four games (sore right foot).  C Ian Mahinmi also played despite entering the game listed as questionable. TRISTAN'S EFFORT While coming off the bench for a third straight game, Thompson recorded a second consecutive double-double He also had four assists to go with his two blocks in a 26-minute outing. He brought that energy from the start of the game til the end of the game, Sexton said. I feel like hes the one that got us over the hump and pretty much got this win for us tonight. Thompson started his first 48 games this season. COACH-SPEAK Wizards coach Scott Brooks had some pregame advice for Bickerstaff, recalling his own start as Oklahoma City's interim head coach during the 2008-09 season. Do the opposite of what I did, Brooks said. I took over at 1-12 and at one point we were 3-29. Thank God we had a very patient organization and general manager ... .""","401161469"
"NEW YORK --  Victor Oladipo didn't have a preseason to get used to the NBA's bumps and bruises again, so Indiana coach Nate McMillan wasn't surprised when his star guard had to end his night early. Back spasms prevented Oladipo from playing the fourth quarter of what was the first game after his minutes restriction had been lifted. The Pacers held on without him to beat the New York Knicks 106-98 on Friday night in their return from the All-Star break. ""Victor is going through what these guys went through in October, falling or hitting the floor. He's going to have some soreness, he's going to have to work his way through that,"" McMillan said, ""and this is to be expected when you've been off for a summer, in Victor's case an entire year."" T.J. Warren had 27 points and eight rebounds, Domantas Sabonis added 24 points and 13 rebounds, and the Pacers won their second straight after a six-game losing streak. Oladipo finished with eight points in his eighth game after returning last month following a year absence with a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee. McMillan thought Oladipo stiffened up after hitting the floor a couple times, but Oladipo said his back locked up after his body contorted when he was fouled taking a shot. He ended up playing 25 minutes and had a good finish to the first half, scoring Indiana's final five points. ""Just trying to get lost in the game as best as I can, trying to get involved as best as I can,"" he said. Bobby Portis scored 19 points and RJ Barrett had 17 for the Knicks, who have lost three in a row. Leading scorer Julius Randle shot 2 for 9 and finished with seven points and seven rebounds. McMillan repeatedly said the Pacers would have to be patient with Oladipo's reintroduction to the team, noting that most times when a player is out as long as he was, he comes back at the start of the season with a full training camp. But Oladipo is working his way back past the midway point of the season, a tough adjustment for a team sitting in sixth place in the Eastern Conference and with work to do if it hopes to earn home-court advantage in the first round. Indiana looked awful early, scoring just 15 points in the first quarter before breaking out for 36 in the second. Oladipo had just one basket before getting the Pacers' final two and sending them into the half with a 51-44 lead. The Pacers then outscored the Knicks 23-8 to start the third, opening a 74-52 advantage when Oladipo made a free throw with 3:45 remaining in the period on the play in which he was apparently hurt. Warren outscored New York by himself during that stretch, with nine points. New York cut it to 91-85 after a 7-0 burst, but Warren had a basket and then a three-point play to stop the comeback and give the Pacers a 96-85 lead with 5:12 to go. The Knicks were able to get within four in the final minute, but the Pacers made enough free throws to hold on. ""I think it was just figuring out their game plan defensively,"" Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina said. ""They had the will to close the paint and we finally figured it out, but it was too late."" TIP-INS Pacers: Oladipo still won't play in both games when the Pacers play on consecutive nights. They have three back-to-backs left. ... Indiana has won four straight at Madison Square Garden. Knicks: Point guard Elfrid Payton sat out with right ankle soreness. Ntilikina started and scored 14 points. ... The Knicks begin three-game trip after this game. VICTOR'S VIEW McMillan said Oladipo would be considered day to day, and Oladipo said he wasn't sure yet if would be able to play Sunday in Toronto. He also downplayed McMillan's point about not having a training camp to get his body used to taking hits again. ""I'm not making no excuses for myself and I don't want nobody else to make any excuses for me,"" Oladipo said.","401161470"
"TORONTO --  Make it 16 wins in 17 games for the surging Toronto Raptors. Pascal Siakam had 37 points and 12 rebounds and Toronto beat Phoenix 118-101 on Friday night, its fifth straight victory over the Suns. Serge Ibaka scored 16 points, Fred VanVleet and Terence Davis each had 14, Kyle Lowry had 13 points and 10 assists and OG Anunoby added 12 points for the defending NBA champion Raptors. After Toronto's franchise-record 15-game winning streak ended with a loss at Brooklyn in the final game before the All-Star break, the Raptors bounced back by starting the second half with their eighth consecutive home victory. ""I just feel energized,"" said Siakam, a first-time All-Star last weekend. The Raptors have not lost back-to-back games since an overtime loss at Indiana on Dec. 23 and a home loss to Boston on Christmas Day. Toronto has gone 19-1 since. ""They set the tone early,"" Suns guard Ricky Rubio said. ""That's why they're a championship team."" Siakam connected on 12 of 19 attempts, going 5 of 9 from 3-point range. He scored 17 points in the first quarter as Toronto built a big first-half lead and didn't let it go. ""The first half, he was lights out,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. ""He hadn't shot the ball like that in a while, so we weren't planning on him making those shots."" Siakam's five 3-pointers were just one fewer than the six the Suns managed on 34 attempts. Phoenix shot 17.6% from long range, its lowest mark of the season. No Suns player made more than one shot from distance. ""That's not the team we are,"" Suns guard Devin Booker said. Booker scored 21 points and DeAndre Ayton had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Phoenix. The Suns lost for the seventh time in nine games and dropped their fifth straight on the road. Ayton returned to the starting lineup after missing the final two games before the All-Star break because of a sore left ankle. Phoenix trailed 93-78 through three quarters, but the Suns cut the gap to six points, 96-90 on a basket by Ayton with 8:08 left to play. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson made a pair from the line, and VanVleet and Siakam both scored to put the Raptors up 102-90 with 6:58 remaining. Booker missed a 3 with 4:45 left that would have made it a four-point game. Anunoby scored on a dunk and, after another missed 3 by the Suns, Ibaka banked home a 3-pointer to restore Toronto's 12-point cushion. TIP-INS Suns: F Dario Saric returned after missing seven games because of sprained left ankle and scored eight points in 19 minutes. C Aaron Baynes ended a 13-game absence caused by a sore left hip. Baynes had five points in 11 minutes. Raptors: Toronto remained without C Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and G Norman Powell (broken finger, left hand). Gasol sat for the ninth straight game, and Powell missed his seventh. . F Patrick McCaw was inactive because of flu-like symptoms. . Toronto had a season-worst 25 turnovers. . The five-game winning streak against Phoenix is the longest in Raptors team history. NO FUN Raptors coach Nick Nurse said he didn't get a lot of pleasure from the second half. ""The game lost its rhythm, and every ounce of enjoyability, there in the third,"" Nurse said. BLOCK PARTY Toronto had a season-high 13 blocks, one more than the 12 they had at Chicago on Oct. 26. ""They're long and athletic,"" Booker said. ""They tipped a lot of shots, got their hands on a lot of balls.""","401161471"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Boston's defense looked, well, like it was still on vacation for much of the game. The Celtics still had plenty of firepower on the other end, staying strong out of the All-Star break. Gordon Hayward scored 29 points, Daniel Theis had career highs with 25 points and 16 rebounds and the Celtics fended off the Minnesota Timberwolves 127-117 on Friday night. The strength of our team is just the amount of guys that can go off at any point in time, especially when youre making the right plays and getting easy looks, Hayward said. ""Were too talented. We just need to continue to do that. Jalen Brown scored 25 points and Jayson Tatum had 28 points and 11 rebounds as fellow All-Star Kemba Walker sat out because of a minor knee injury. The four players at 25 or more points marked just the second such occurrence in Celtics history. Tom Heinsohn, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman did it on Jan. 20, 1960. It just shows how deep and how good our team is, Theis said. Marcus Smart had 10 points and a season-high 10 assists as the primary point guard in Walker's place, helping the Celtics win for the ninth time in last 10 games on the first stop of a four-game road trip. They're 1 1/2 games behind defending NBA champion Toronto for second place in the suddenly stacked Eastern Conference. Though the Celtics have allowed the third-lowest opponent scoring average in the league, the short-handed Timberwolves did plenty of damage with the ball despite taking their 16th loss in 17 games. Malik Beasley scored 27 points, D'Angelo Russell had 18 points and a season-high 13 assists, and Juancho Hernangomez added a season-high 17 points. Rookie Naz Reid had 19 points and nine rebounds in 33 minutes, starting for the injured Karl-Anthony Towns. Reid got Theis benched just two minutes into the game for an uncontested layup. The Wolves equaled every bit of energy from the Celtics, even if the talent levels didn't match. At the end, everybody knows I dont care about the scoring. I care about the defensive part. Weve still got to get better on defense. We gave up a lot of stuff, Theis said. Beasley, who had 16 points in the second quarter, pulled up for a 28-footer at the halftime horn to bring the Wolves within 61-53 right after Tatum had blown by them for a dunk on the other end. Hayward had 15 points in the third quarter for the Celtics, who ran their lead up to 68-55 before the Wolves again motored back. Beasley took a no-look backward bounce pass from Russell on a fast break for a layup that cut the lead to 72-67. Reid's 3-pointer then brought the Wolves within two. Rookie point guard Jordan McLaughlin, who's on a two-way contract for Minnesota, made all three of his 3-point attempts, the last one that cut the lead to 100-98. The crowd was alive as the Wolves twice came within one point after that, only to fail to take back the lead they hadn't had since midway through the first quarter. After Theis muscled inside for a layup and Russell missed from deep, Tatum swished a 3-pointer to give the Celtics a 119-11 edge with 3:55 to go. When you play a team like Boston, the way they approach this season, the way they're kind of navigating this season, you know you have to be pretty much close to perfect to come out with a victory, Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""We weren't that tonight."" BOARD REPORT With Reid and James Johnson trying to man the paint, the Wolves were outrebounded 58-43. In the aftermath of their roster-rattling trades two weeks ago and the injury to Towns, they're particularly thin in the frontcourt. They were very tough with the guards, their height, Tatum and Brown crashing in, and then the bigs going at it, Reid said. Its kind of hard to check out all of those guys. But I attempted to, and things didnt go our way."" TAKING CARE OF KEMBA Walker was held out by left knee trouble, but his absence is not expected to be long-term. He had the joint drained and injected to address swelling and soreness that arose after the All-Star game. Walker will be re-evaluated on the next stop on the road trip, Los Angeles. Walker, in his first season with Boston, played 46 minutes in the last game before the break. He also logged 29 minutes in the All-Star game itself, but the Celtics said his his injury was unrelated to the midseason showcase Sunday. TIP-INS Celtics: Backup center Robert Williams who missed his 34th straight game with a left hip injury that has kept him out for 2 1/2 months, resumed practicing after the All-Star break. He joined with the team on this trip and is on track to rejoin the rotation next week upon return to Boston, subject to final medical clearance. Timberwolves: With Towns sidelined, Reid had his first career start. The popular undrafted rookie even heard some stray MVP! chants during a fourth-quarter trip to the line.","401161472"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Chris Paul lectured his teammates on the importance of handling their business after the All-Star break, then he showed them how to do it. Paul scored 29 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Denver Nuggets 113-101 on Friday night. The Thunder entered the night sixth in the Western Conference standings. Paul believes Oklahoma City should have a sense of urgency about finishing higher. ""Some teams try to warm up into it,"" Paul said. ""We don't got that benefit. We've got to come out, 20-something games left -- it's the homestretch."" Steven Adams had 19 points and 17 rebounds, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 11 points, nine rebounds and nine assists for the Thunder. They have won 11 of their past 14 games. The Thunder had seven players score in double figures. Once again, the point guard trio of Paul, Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder set the tone. ""If you guys had mics on us, you'd see that we are all each other's biggest cheerleaders,"" Paul said. ""I've seen teams where guys aren't necessarily rooting for each other. They want you to do bad so they can be in the game. We're not like that, and it's refreshing and nice to see."" Nikola Jokic scored 32 points on 12-for-15 shooting and Jamal Murray had 21 points for the Nuggets. They entered the night with the second-best record in the Western Conference. Oklahoma City scored 25 points off Denver's 19 turnovers. ""We didn't take care of the ball,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""That was a huge issue that happened all night long. We didn't value the ball for 48 minutes."" Paul banked in a shot and was fouled with 2.7 seconds left in the first half to tie it, but missed the free throw and the score remained 48-all at halftime. The Thunder opened the second half on a 9-1 run that forced the Nuggets to call a timeout. Denver responded, and a 10-0 run cut Oklahoma City's lead to 60-59. A steal and dunk by Oklahoma City's Luguentz Dort sent the floor cleanup crew scrambling and gave the Thunder a 66-61 lead. ""I can't say enough about Lu,"" Paul said. ""He makes all the plays that nobody else would. That steal he got -- I just thought about it. And that dunk."" Paul was fouled on a made 3-pointer, and his free throw put Oklahoma City up 72-65. The Thunder took a 78-77 edge into the fourth quarter. Oklahoma City, as it has done so often this season, took over in the final period. A dunk by Nerlens Noel on a lob from Schroder put the Thunder up 95-85. A dunk by Adams gave Oklahoma City a 109-97 edge with just under two minutes remaining. Adams scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, one of eight Thunder players to score in the period. ""If you got it going, we're going to get it to them,"" Paul said. ""And we just take what's open."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Missed all seven of their 3-point attempts in the first quarter and made just 6 of 27 overall. ... Made 31 of 50 shots inside the 3-point line and 21 of 23 free throws. Thunder: Dort made the first 3-pointer by either team more than eight minutes into the game. ... Former University of Oklahoma tight end Blake Bell of the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs attended the game. ... F Danilo Gallinari was called for a flagrant 1 in the second quarter. QUOTABLE Paul, on committing seven of Oklahoma City's 12 turnovers: ""How many did we have? I probably had seven or eight. I had more than half of them. I've got to be better."" GRANT'S RECEPTION Former Thunder player Jerami Grant received a nice ovation from the crowd when he checked into the game in the first quarter. Oklahoma City traded the forward to Denver this past summer. ""I thought it was great,"" Grant said. ""I love the fans here. Got a bunch of great memories here. I think it was definitely good.""

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Encouraging Dejounte Murray to play with more offensive freedom is turning out to be a winning formula for the San Antonio Spurs. Murray had his second straight 20-point game, tallying 23 points and seven rebounds, to lead a balanced attack that helped the Spurs beat the Utah Jazz 113-104 on Friday night. He also tied his season high with four steals. Such performances are quickly becoming a trend for the fourth-year guard. Over his past four games, Murray is shooting 60% from the field while averaging 19.8 points. ""When you get to play with freedom, it brings the best out of you because it builds confidence,"" Murray said. ""Your teammates and coaches believe in you."" San Antonio used a 17-0 run late in the second half to turn a four-point game into a lopsided affair. Murray scored three baskets to fuel the game-changing run. His third one finished it off and gave the Spurs a 65-44 lead. It offered a sweet moment for Murray, who has experienced plenty of highs and lows this season while trying to regain his form after sitting out all of last season while recovering from knee surgery. He feels like his game is still a work in progress, but it is getting better all the time. ""It's not easy to come back and be the best that you can be,"" Murray said. ""I'm just working and I'm going to continue to work and see where it takes me."" DeMar DeRozan added 18 points and seven assists for the Spurs. LaMarcus Aldridge chipped in 15 points and eight rebounds. Six players scored in double figures as San Antonio beat the Jazz for the second time this season. Rudy Gobert finished with 18 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Jazz. Emmanuel Mudiay chipped in 18 points and Jordan Clarkson added 15 off the bench for Utah. The Jazz had a four-game winning streak end with the loss. The Spurs came out firing and had quite a bit of early success. They put together a 14-5 run in the first to go up 24-15 and made six straight shots to open the second quarter. ""We were trying to make everything difficult for them when they had the ball,"" DeRozan said. ""We just tried to get out and play freely."" Before San Antonio pulled away for good, the Jazz cut the deficit to 46-42 on a 14-4 run bookended by a pair of baskets from Gobert. Then Utah went cold, and the Spurs methodically put the Jazz away. ""They were way too comfortable,"" Gobert said. ""Everything they did was free of movement. They were having fun and did whatever they wanted to do."" San Antonio shot 54% from the field in the second quarter alone, including 5 of 7 from 3-point range. The Spurs matched a season-high with 38 points during the quarter. Mudiay made three baskets over a two-minute stretch to open the fourth, helping the Jazz close to within 96-84. That's as close as Utah could get in its comeback effort. ""We did respond,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We just responded too late."" NIGHT AND DAY Utah experienced a bit of deja vu after San Antonio enjoyed considerable success on mid-range and perimeter jumpers for the second time in as many meetings this season. The Spurs made 10 of 20 from 3-point range and connected on 46% of their field goal attempts outside the paint. Utah, meanwhile, scored 14 baskets outside the paint and never found a rhythm from the perimeter until it was too late. HE SAID IT ""They played like they didn't have an All-Star break and were ready to go. We didn't come ready to play from the jump and that is what happens."" -- Guard Donovan Mitchell on the Spurs' dominating the Jazz for much of the final three quarters.

"Doris Burke explains how LeBron James has altered his style of play this season to keep himself fresh and healthy. (1:58) LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers hadn't even been back on the court for three minutes after the All-Star break when Anthony Davis limped off with an injured leg. With their superstar big man in the locker room, the Lakers played an ominous quarter wondering whether their playoff push had just hit some massive resistance. Instead, Davis got his legs back under him and put up a monster performance that reminded everybody why the Lakers are atop the West. LeBron James scored 32 points, Davis recovered from that early scare to get 28 points, 13 rebounds and seven blocked shots, and Los Angeles returned from the break with a 117-105 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. Davis bruised his right calf on an opponent's knee shortly after the opening tip. He has been slowed by several knocks that turned out to be minor throughout the season -- and after several minutes of treatment, he returned to cheers in the second quarter. ""The leg felt good enough for me to go out and give it a try,"" Davis said with a shrug. ""I just wanted to be on the floor to help the guys."" He found his formidable game after halftime, putting up 24 points along with 11 boards and five blocks in the second half. Davis also led the Lakers' interior defensive efforts against the Grizzlies, whose well-known ability to drive to the rim only resulted in 14 blocked shots by Los Angeles. Davis had 14 points, seven rebounds and four blocks in the fourth quarter alone as Los Angeles improved to 42-12 with its fourth straight win since Feb. 6. ""Another Defensive Player of the Year-type of night from Anthony,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""He's the best defender in the league from a versatility standpoint. Especially against a team like this, where you have concerns about a basket-attacking guard like Ja Morant."" Avery Bradley added 14 points for the Western Conference-leading Lakers, who finished strong after blowing most of their 25-point lead accumulated in a superb first half. ""Give the Lakers a lot of credit,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""They came out and just kind of punked us in that first half. We weren't ready to play in the first half. Proud of the guys to fight back, pick up our activity and win the third quarter. ... Overall, just one of those games where we didn't come ready to play, and we've got to learn from this."" Josh Jackson scored a season-high 20 points for the Grizzlies, who have lost back-to-back games in California after heading into the All-Star break with eight wins in 10. ""A lot of defensive guys threw different looks at me,"" said Morant, who scored 17 points. ""It's just what they do. I feel like everybody knows those guys are great defenders, but I still try to attack the game the same way. Tonight I missed layups. Missed a wide-open pull-up. Made some shots, and forced some. I could have been better."" The Grizzlies erased most of LA's lead with a strong third quarter, but the Lakers hung on with a series of big plays, including a jaw-dropping rebound dunk by Alex Caruso off a missed free throw by Davis with 6:16 to play. The Lakers improved to 3-0 against the Grizzlies this season. They meet again in Memphis on Feb. 29. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis signed G Dusty Hannahs to a 10-day contract before the game. He leads the Grizzlies' G League affiliate with 21.3 points per game this season, and he appeared in two games for Memphis earlier this season. ... Gorgui Dieng had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Lakers: Vogel and the team declined to comment on multiple reports claiming the team will release center DeMarcus Cousins to clear a roster spot. Cousins hasn't played for the Lakers after tearing a ligament in his knee in August, but he had been rehabbing with hopes of returning for the playoffs. Cousins was in the Lakers' locker room before the game, but didn't sit with the team on the bench. INJURED JACKSON Jaren Jackson Jr. didn't play in the second half due to knee soreness from an awkward fall in the first half. Jenkins had no postgame update on the starting forward's condition, but the Grizzlies have the next two days off. QUICK START Although James, Davis and Dwight Howard were busy in Chicago over the break, the Lakers returned with impressive defensive focus across the roster. Los Angeles held Memphis to 15-for-38 shooting and forced 11 turnovers in the first half. RESCHEDULED GAME The game against the Clippers that was postponed by Kobe Bryant's death will be made up April 9. The NBA also rescheduled two additional Lakers games, and the moves mean they'll have to play at home on three consecutive nights in early April, just one week before the start of the postseason. ""We may stagger some of the guys that play,"" Vogel said. ""Some guys may not play in all three games. We'll have those conversations as we get closer to those games and see what the standings look like.""","401161475"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Zion Williamson hears the accolades but insists he's still getting comfortable in his new job. He had 25 points for his seventh straight game with at least 20, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers 128-115 on Friday night. Even though I'm a rookie and people think I'm doing good there's still so much I have to learn, he said. There's so much about the game I'm still learning, I feel like by year four, five I'm gonna have all that down. The No. 1 draft pick was playing in just his 11th game after a right knee injury sidelined him for the first half of the season. The Pelicans, who led by as many as 22 points, have won four of their last five games. Even his teammates are impressed. He definitely takes us to another level, Jrue Holiday said. He's so hard to guard and hard to stop, so for him to be doing that 10 or 11 games in is impressive."" The Blazers, who have lost three straight, were without Damian Lillard, who is expected to miss three or more games because of a groin injury that occurred in Memphis last week. It kept Lillard out of the All-Star Game and the 3-point contest last weekend. Lillard is averaging a career-high 29.5 points and 7.8 assists. His absence hurts the Blazers, who went into the game 3.5 games back of Memphis for eighth in the Western Conference standings. And its not just Lillard: Portland had only nine players available for the game. CJ McCollum took over as point guard and finished with 27 points and 10 assists. Hassan Whiteside added 19 points and 12 rebounds. Overall I thought we competed, we just didn't play well enough defensively to win, McCollum said. The Pelicans were among four teams, along with the Blazers, fighting for those last playoff berths with just a third of the season left. Coach Alvin Gentry said he's treating the last 27 games like a college season. We want to play to get into a tournament. We want a high seed. Those are the things that weve talked about. Obviously, we have to play good basketball, Gentry said. The Pelicans also won the previous three meetings this season with Portland. Earlier this month in New Orleans, Williamson had 31 points and nine rebounds in a 138-117 victory over the Blazers. Williamson, who played just one season at Duke before going pro, went into the game against the Blazers averaging 22.1 points and 7.5 rebounds. His streak of games with 20-plus points is the longest among NBA rookies this season. And he was the first player since Michael Jordan to have 20 or more in eight of his first 10 NBA games. At just 19, he's the youngest player in league history with 20-plus points in seven straight games. He just fits in, Gentry said about his emerging star. It's not like we call a bunch of plays for him. Our guys do a good job in the flow of our offense trying to find him. Lonzo Balls 3-pointer put the Pelicans up 29-17 in the opening quarter. But the Blazers closed within 40-38 early in the second on Whitesides dunk. It was as close as Portland could get, and Williamsons dunk gave New Orleans a 54-46 lead. Williamsons layup pushed the Pelicans' advantage to 65-50 and New Orleans led 73-63 going into halftime. He led all players with 19 points. Consecutive jumpers from Carmelo Anthony and Whiteside's dunk pulled Portland within 80-75 in the third quarter. The Pelicans pulled away with a 12-0 run to head to the fourth with 102-83 lead. Portland closed the gap a bit in the fourth when back-to-back 3-pointers from Trevor Ariza and McCollum got the Blazers within 114-105. Holiday's 3 and Ball's layup extended New Orleans' lead again and fans at the Moda Center headed for the exits. Holiday finished with 20 points and nine assists. TIP INS Pelicans: The Pelicans were coming off a 123-118 loss at home to Oklahoma City before the All-Star break. Williamson had 32 points.  New Orleans missed 12 free throws in the first half. ... The Pelicans have won three straight on the road. ... Josh Hart finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds off the bench. Trail Blazers: The Blazers swept the Pelicans in three games last season. With Lillard sidelined, Gary Trent Jr. got his third start for the Blazers. His dad, who played for the Blazers from 1995-98, was on hand to watch. MEETING MELO: For much of the night, Williamson faced veteran Carmelo Anthony, whose task it was to try to stop the teenager. I don't know if I would say that was fun, but he's Carmelo, Williamson said about going up against Anthony. His resume speaks for itself. He's a crafty player. It's always tough to match up against players like that, but I love the challenge.","401161476"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Sacramento Kings realize they might have started playing their best basketball of the season too late to contend for a playoff spot. Beating the powerhouse Los Angeles Clippers on the road twice in less than a month still feels awfully good, even if the Clips are far from the best version of themselves these days. Kent Bazemore scored a season-high 23 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic added 20 and the Kings made a decisive fourth-quarter surge to beat the Clippers 112-103 on Saturday. De'Aaron Fox had 20 points and eight assists for the surging Kings, who have won two straight out of the All-Star break and eight of 12 overall. Sacramento is still just 23-33, but the progress is encouraging for the franchise with its NBA-worst playoff drought at 13 seasons. ""We're feeling a lot better about ourselves now,"" Fox said. ""Obviously we need to keep this going, but we came out of the All-Star break and we were prepared. We're in a good place right now. We can only control ourselves as far as the rest of the season goes, but we're feeling good."" Sacramento blew a 14-point lead in the second half to a Clippers lineup missing injured stars Paul George and Patrick Beverley. But the Kings then shut out Kawhi Leonard and the Clips for more than five straight minutes down the stretch, making a decisive 10-0 run capped by Harry Giles' percussive dunk off an alley-oop from Bogdanovic with 58 seconds left. ""That was a good moment to finish the game out strong on,"" said Giles, who had 14 points and 12 rebounds in his first career double-double. ""We're on a better path now. We're in a groove, but let's just keep it going."" Leonard scored 31 points in his first game back from his MVP performance in Chicago, but the Clippers returned from the All-Star break with their first three-game losing streak of the season. Lou Williams added 24 points for LA, and Montrezl Harrell had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Sacramento had a big lead late in the third quarter, but the Clippers took their first lead of the day on Harrell's leap-and-lean bucket with 8:30 to play. Shortly after that, the Clippers went through their decisive drought. ""We had a lot of different people helping out, and it felt good,"" Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. ""We were solid for most of the game. We had a couple of drop-offs where we got a little sloppy, but it was one of our more consistent games."" TIP-INS Kings: Alex Len had three points and eight rebounds in 16 minutes during his first action since Jan. 24. He has been out with a right hip flexor strain. ...

Beverley still competed in the skills challenge at All-Star weekend ... Len and Harrell got technical fouls for a shouting match early in the fourth quarter. SLOW START The Clippers returned from eight days off and missed 13 of their first 14 shots on their way to a 4-for-24 first quarter with five turnovers. ""We weren't ready to play,"" Leonard said. ""I just didn't feel like we were locked in early, and then it was too late to turn the switch on. We've got to keep getting better. It's about the team peaking at the right time."" NEW GUYS Reggie Jackson scored eight points in his Clippers debut two days after the Pistons bought him out, while Marcus Morris had six points and five turnovers in 32 minutes in his home debut nearly two weeks after the Clippers acquired him in a three-way trade. NEW LOOK With the Clippers comfortably in third place in the Western Conference, George and Beverley are both getting extra time off to rest persistent injuries. Clippers coach Doc Rivers used his 28th starting lineup in 56 games, putting newcomers Morris and Jackson in the mix. The resulting unfamiliarity contributed to the loss, they said. ""That was (Jackson's) first game, and because of our injury issues, we had to start him,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""It is what it is.""","401161477"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and the Brooklyn Nets appeared to be on a mission after surrendering a 20-point lead in their last game. And it showed with almost every Nets player that played. Luwawu-Cabarrot led a balanced scoring attack with 21 points and the Nets built a 25-point lead in the third quarter and didn't let up, snapping the Charlotte Hornets' three-game win streak with a 115-86 victory Saturday night. Eight Brooklyn players scored in double figures, including Caris LeVert with 17. Garrett Temple added 15 points and 10 rebounds, Jarrett Allen had 12 points and 11 rebounds and the Nets bounced back from an overtime loss in Philadelphia on Thursday. ""We want more than what we have right now. We just want more,"" Luwawu-Cabarrot said. ""We're hungry."" Brooklyn built a 10-point halftime lead and outscored the Hornets 33-13 in the third quarter to take control. This time, the Nets didn't let the lead slip away. ""We played with a chip on our shoulder,"" said Nets coach Kenny Atkinson. ""I think we wanted to prove something. I felt it before the game in the locker room. We feel like we can still do something special."" P.J. Washington had 16 points for the Hornets. ""They were just making shots pretty much the whole game, getting offensive rebounds and getting stops and getting out in transition,"" Washington said. ""We couldn't really stop them from hitting corner 3s."" Atkinson was pleased with the balanced scoring in the aftermath of the team's announcement that point guard Kyrie Irving would not return to play this season. ""The ball was hopping tonight,"" Atkinson said. ""It was moving around; guys were touching it. But with all that being said, we miss Kyrie and we need Kyrie. Badly. So, it was a good performance, I'm very pleased. Was very pleased by the maturity we showed."" The Hornets managed to beat the Bulls in Chicago on Thursday night without co-leading scorer Devonte Graham scoring a point. But they couldn't replicate the feat against the Nets with Graham struggling again from the field. One of the league's most improved players this season, Graham was limited to six points on 1-of-10 shooting by the Nets. The Nets are in the midst of a stretch of eight of 10 games on the road. They are 3-2 so far during that run. TIP-INS Nets: Former North Carolina Tar Heel Theo Pinson received a big cheer when he scored his first points late in the fourth quarter. ...

Hornets: Malik Monk has scored 15 or more points in six straight games, the longest streak of such games since he had seven straight in 2018. ... Bench was outscored 50-27. GRAHAM'S SLUMP Hornets coach James Borrego said Graham's slump is in part due to how much attention other teams are paying him. But he said it's up to the second-year guard to continue to fight through the pressure and improve. ""He just has to keep grinding and working his way through it,"" Borrego said. ""You don't hang your head. You just keeping working and grow. I hope the next team throws the full bucket at him again. That's how you grow and adapt to this league and get better."" ZONED UP The Nets used a zone defense at different points in the game and it seemed to rattle the Hornets. ""I think the zone really disrupted us, took us out of our little motions so credit to them they were just better than us tonight,"" Monk said.","401161478"
"ATLANTA --  John Collins was in no mood to feel sorry for the Dallas Mavericks and their short-handed roster. I feel like I definitely took advantage of the mismatches I had tonight,"" Collins said. As you guys know, I can crash the basket pretty well, so I think I definitely took advantage of that and made the most of it."" Collins had 35 points and 17 rebounds, Trae Young scored 13 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and the Atlanta Hawks rallied late to beat the Mavericks 111-107 on Saturday night. Collins' follow shot, credited after a goaltending call was overturned, sealed it with 8.4 seconds remaining. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 20 of his season high-tying 33 points in the first half and Seth Curry added 22 for Dallas, which couldn't overcome a lack of depth. The game was billed as a showdown between Luka Doncic and Young, two second-year All-Stars linked together since a draft-night trade in 2018, but the matchup never materialized. Doncic, who led Dallas to a win over Orlando the night before, was held out so he could rest his ankle, meaning that he and Young won't face each other again until next season. Doncic missed a 123-100 Mavericks victory against Atlanta earlier this month in Dallas with a similar injury. Obviously I love playing against the best players in our league and Luka is obviously up there,"" Young said. For me, it's tough not getting to play against him, but for him, I want him to get healthy."" The Mavericks were also without Kristaps Porzingis, sidelined to rest his knee, and Willie Cauley-Stein, who missed the game for personal reasons. Young had a sluggish start two nights after scoring a career-high 50 in a stirring home win over Miami, but he got hot in time to keep Dallas from moving over .500 for the first time since February 2015. The Hawks took their first lead of the game with 5:24 remaining on Dewayne Dedmon's basket. Hardaway hit a 3 to put Dallas back ahead before Young hit a long 3 and Collins had two free throws to give the Hawks a 107-104 lead with 1:13 remaining. Hardaway tied it at 107-all with a 3, but Young hit a layup with 57.5 seconds remaining. We gave up over 30 points in the second quarter again and we let up in the fourth, Hardaway said. We were up double digits going into the fourth. We let up. It's hard to see, but it happened."" The Mavericks led by as many as 16 midway through the second on Delon Wright's layup before the Hawks pulled within four on Collins' alley-oop dunk at the 9:06 mark of the third. The Hawks, who rank last in 3-point shooting, missed 10 of their first 11 shots beyond the arc and finished at 21.6% on 31 attempts. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dropped to 19-9 on the road, but they're still among the league leaders away from home after winning a combined 18 road games over the two seasons combined. Hawks: Collins, who tied a career high in scoring, leads the NBA this month with six games of at least 20 points and 10 boards. ... F De'Andre Hunter missed the game for personal reasons. FURTHER EVIDENCE The Mavericks were livid that Collins' shot counted in the closing seconds. Dorian Finney-Smith appeared to be called for goaltending on Young's layup attempt, and a whistle blew. Collins grabbed the ball and then scored with play apparently stopped. Officials then reviewed the play on video. There was an inadvertent whistle that came after the putback,"" team owner Mark Cuban said. Everybody who said they were watching it said it came before the putback. There's neither here nor there because if it's an inadvertent whistle and it's a goaltend with an inadvertent whistle, then you stop play, but then they went and reviewed it and they reviewed it for a goaltend."" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle, asked by reporters if the officials gave him an explanation, said, Not a sufficient one. Just a very disappointing way to end the game. Our guys fought their butts off from start to finish. My understanding, if it's a good block on a goaltend that's called and reversed, if there's no control or the other team gets it, it's a jump ball, so I don't know. It's baffling. It's disappointing."" Officiating crew chief Rodney Mott told a pool reporter that the original call on the floor was a goaltend and that Collins' basket was allowed because the ball was blocked and reviewed. The ball hit the rim, so it was deemed an inadvertent whistle. It's Rule 2. Because (Collins) was in his shooting motion when my whistle blew, it's deemed continuation, so therefore the basket counts."" AILING Guard Jalen Brunson became the latest Mavericks player to get hurt, leaving with a right shoulder sprain on the first possession of the game. Dallas already was without its two leading scorers when Brunson was fouled by Dedmon while driving for a layup. He went straight to the locker room after shooting a free throw and was soon ruled out. That left the Mavericks, tied for the sixth spot in the Western Conference, with 10 available players, all of whom played in the first quarter. Brunson and Curry started in place of Doncic and Porzingis as Carlisle went with a three-guard lineup. Doncic was held out in the second night of a back-to-back to rest the right ankle he has sprained twice, an injury that sidelined him both times. Porzingis missed his third straight back-to-back to rest his surgically repaired left knee. Curry was questionable before the game with right knee soreness that kept him out of consecutive games earlier this month. Dwight Powell was lost for the season to a ruptured right Achilles last month.","401161479"
"MIAMI --  The Miami Heat played so well early they didn't need a halftime meeting, which was exactly the plan. In a worthy warmup for Dwyane Wade's jersey retirement ceremony, the Heat broke a 23-year-old franchise record for points in the first half en route to a 124-105 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday. Miami shot 77% in the first half and then turned the stage over to Wade, whose No. 3 jersey was hoisted to the rafters. ""I just wanted to make sure we played well enough in the first half we didn't need to necessarily meet,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said, ""because I wanted to enjoy halftime, and I wanted our players to be out there and see it."" The ceremony was part of a three-day celebration of Wade's career that included three NBA titles with Miami. The Heat believe they're building another championship contender, and they looked the part against the hapless Cavaliers. ""It felt great to win and just get in front of this Heat culture and fans,"" forward-center Bam Adebayo said. ""It's a beautiful thing we've created. We want to keep that going."" Miami made its first nine shots and led 38-32 after one quarter. Then Wade made a grand entrance to take his seat in the first row across from the home team bench, and the Heat really stepped on the gas. They went 15 for 17 in the second period, outscoring the Cavs 44-20 for an 82-52 lead at the half. Wade's impression of the first half? ""I didn't watch it,"" he said. After taking his seat, he spent much of the time chatting with other spectators, and departed before halftime to prepare for the ceremony. He missed seeing the Heat break the franchise record of 75 points in the first half in November 1997 against the Los Angeles Clippers, a mark that predated Wade's 16-year NBA career. Rookie Kendrick Nunn led seven scorers in double figures for Miami with 24 points, and he had eight assists. Adebayo had 15 points and nine assists. Miami shot a season-best 57% and made 19 3-pointers. The game was so lopsided that Wade's close friend, Udonis Haslem, played for only the third time this season during garbage time. ""They just wore us down,"" Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""The way they were creating shots -- and they were open shots, too -- we made some mistakes on some switches and we allowed some guys to get free."" Cedi Osman led Cleveland with 19 points. The Heat earned their eighth consecutive victory against the Cavs, including three this season, and have beaten Cleveland 18 times in a row in Miami. NOT PLAYING Guard-forward Jimmy Butler, the Heat's leading scorer, was sidelined for personal reasons. Guard Tyler Herro and forward-center Meyers Leonard missed their seventh game in a row with ankle injuries. Cavaliers forward-center Kevin Love sat out for the second time in the past three games because of a sore right Achilles' tendon. TIP-INS Heat: Playing shorthanded lately because of injuries, they had lost five of their past six games. They improved to 23-3 at home. ""This place is surreal,"" Nunn said. ""We have the best fans in the league."" Cavaliers: They fell to 15-41, worst in the Eastern Conference, and 1-1 under Bickerstaff.","401161480"
"CHICAGO --  Disappointed he didn't make a bigger impact the previous night against the defending champions, DeAndre Ayton sure made his presence felt against the Bulls. Ayton dominated with 28 points and 19 rebounds, Devin Booker had 29 points and the Phoenix Suns beat the Chicago Bulls 112-104 on Saturday night. Phoenix outscored Chicago by 13 in the third quarter to wipe out a 10-point halftime deficit and ended the game on a 17-4 run to come away with the win after losing seven of nine. The Bulls dropped their eighth in a row. Ayton wasn't thrilled with his performance in a 118-101 loss at Toronto on Friday. He had 17 points and 10 rebounds in that one after missing the final two games before the All-Star break because of a sore left ankle. Against the Bulls, he simply took over -- particularly down the stretch. Ayton had 12 points and eight rebounds in the fourth quarter and just missed season highs in scoring (31) and rebounding (21). ""It's one thing when you hear it from coaches -- Am I doing the right thing,"" he said. ""But it's another thing hearing it from your teammates, (who) you see everyday and laugh and joke around with and goof around. You know when to get serious. ... I just woke up. Mental toughness, to be honest."" The Suns would like to see more of that. ""That's a monster night,"" coach Monty Williams said. ""I told him we need him to play with that disposition every night."" Booker made 5 of 10 from beyond the arc in another solid showing in Chicago. The guard placed second to Sacramento's Buddy Hield in the 3-point contest and made his first All-Star appearance last weekend in Chicago. Ricky Rubio added 18 points and 11 assists, and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 14 points to help the Suns snap a five-game road losing streak. Bulls rookie Coby White set a career high with 33 points and matched one by making seven 3-pointers. Zach LaVine scored 20 points. But he also committed seven of Chicago's season-worst 26 turnovers. ""It felt great,"" White said. ""I was having fun. It would have a lot more fun if we could have come out with the win."" FINAL RUN Chicago led 96-95 when Phoenix's Cameron Johnson made a 3 with 6:30 left to give the Suns a 98-86 lead, sparking the game-ending run. Mikal Bridges and Booker each made a pair of free throws to push the lead to 11 in the closing minute. LaVine dunked, before Rubio hit 1 of 2 foul shots with 30 seconds left to make it 112-102. Chicago's Ryan Arcidiacano then made two free throws for a final score that left fans showering the Bulls with boos. CALLING TIME Bulls coach Jim Boylen has annoyed opponents by calling timeouts late in games that were out of hand. He did it again with 30 seconds left, and LaVine appeared agitated when he was caught on camera. ""He hasn't said a word to me about it agitating him,"" Boylen said. ""I don't know if you're reading his mind on that or are you just making an assumption that's what he was upset about?"" LaVine insisted he and Boylen are ""good."" He said he's frustrated about losing. As for the late timeouts? ""That's what he do,"" LaVine said. ""I don't know what to tell you? I'm not the coach. He told me he likes working on things that we do in practice and things like that. He's the coach; he can call time out if he wants to."" TIP-INS Suns: The Suns were basically at full strength, though C Frank Kaminsky (right knee stress fracture) missed his 24th game in a row. Kaminsky, who's from the Chicago area, is Bulls assistant coach Karen Umlauf's nephew. Bulls: The Bulls made 14 of 38 3-pointers, after missing their first 17 in a 7-of-31 performance against Charlotte two nights earlier. ... C Luke Kornet (ankle) was unavailable.","401161481"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks turned a tight game with the Philadelphia 76ers into a mismatch immediately in the second half, led by the reigning league MVP. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 17 rebounds, Khris Middleton scored 25 points and the Bucks beat the 76ers 119-98 on Saturday night in a matchup of Eastern Conference rivals. Antetokounmpo scored Milwaukees first 11 points in the third quarter as the Bucks took advantage of the absence of Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid, who went to the bench less a minute into the period after picking up his fourth foul, and quickly put the game out of reach. We came out the third quarter and played fast, Antetokounmpo said. ""We were able to rebound the ball and just attack them. Joel had four fouls. That worked in our favor. We tried to be aggressive in the third quarter and set the tone. Antetokounmpo added eight assists as Milwaukee won for the 16th time in its last 18 games to improve its NBA-best record to 48-8. The Bucks led 56-50 at the half before Antetokounmpo's scoring outburst put the Bucks in control. Milwaukee would go on to outscore the 76ers 37-23 in the period. Embiid, coming off a 39-point performance on Thursday night, had 17 points and 11 rebounds but shot just 5 for 18. Furkan Korkmaz and Shake Milton also scored 17 points apiece for the 76ers, who fell to 9-20 on the road. I liked what I was seeing in the first half, and the death knock was Joel sitting, 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We just didnt respond well to Milwaukee playing their tails off, and they shot the heck out of the ball. Philadelphia lost All-Star point guard Ben Simmons early in the first quarter. Simmons, who missed the 76ers' previous game with lower back tightness, headed to the locker room after making consecutive driving layups, the second with a little more than 7 minutes left in the opening quarter. He didnt return after the injured flared up. We never got in a rhythm. Losing Ben, then foul trouble, not making shots and some calls that could have gone a different way,"" Embiid said. But its on us. The 76ers shot just 35%, while the Bucks connected on 53% of their shots. The Bucks got off to a scorching start, taking a 12-2 lead sparked by seven points from Antetokounmpo. Milwaukee led by as many as 11 in the quarter and held a 31-21 lead at the end. Philadelphia pulled within 37-36 in the second before the Bucks used a 10-2 spurt to push the lead back to double digits. TIP-INS 76ers: Shot 4 of 19 from 3-point range in the first half. Made 17 of 50 overall (34%). Embiid picked up two fouls in the first 50 seconds of the third quarter.  Milton scored the teams first eight points of the third quarter. Bucks: F Kyle Korver sat out a third consecutive game with back soreness. Were hopeful that its not a significant period of time that he misses, coach Mike Budenholzer said. Korver wont travel with the team for an upcoming two-game road trip. Bucks shot two free throws in first half, while Philadelphia attempted 14Bucks Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson attended the game.  The Bucks extended their regular season streak of scoring 100 points to 80 games, fifth-longest streak in NBA history. Milwaukee has also tallied 110 points in its last 17 games, the longest streak in the NBA this season. BEST BALLER Following Thursday nights win over Brooklyn, Embiid proclaimed himself to be the best player in the world. The statement caught his coachs attention. Its not my style, Brown said. It is his style. There has always been a mischievous side, a playful side with Joel Embiid. And in many ways, he uses that as his own compass. I believe he has a chance to be. I dont think hes that far off. Budenhozler didnt want to get caught up in any debate. Hes a great player. To say who is the best is not for me and I dont think its that important,"" he said. Antetokounmpo playfully chided reporters after the game when asked about Embiid's comment. You want me to say something that is going to go viral. He's going to see it and there's going to be a battle,"" Antetokounmpo said. I like him. I like his personality. We were good teammates in the All-Star Game. Who am I to tell him he's not the best player in the world? Everybody should feel that way. But at the end of the day, if you feel that way, you've got to go on the court and show it. ROAD WOES The 76ers' road woes contrast with a 26-2 record at home, leaving Brown stumped. I dont know. We have to fix this, Brown said. As I told the team, it is a house built on sand otherwise. PACKED HOUSE A record crowd of 18,290 packed the Fiserv Forum, a new record for the arena, which opened last season. The previous record of 18,148 was set last season, also against Philadelphia.","401161482"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Team are trying to get creative in guarding the Houston Rockets. Russell Westbrook doesn't think the ploys are effective. James Harden shrugged off traps to score 38 points, Westbrook faced two-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert and still had 34 and the Rockets beat the Utah Jazz 120-110 on Saturday night. ""I don't know if it's working. I get whatever I want. I get to the basket. I shoot. I drive and kick. The pace and speed you can't scout for,"" Westbrook said. Harden (13 for 23, 6 3-pointers) and Westbrook (14 for 26) were efficient all night and the Rockets rode a big third quarter to their third straight win. ""It obviously didn't work,"" Harden said when asked about putting the 7-foot-1 Gobert on the 6-3 Westbrook. Eric Gordon and Ben McLemore each scored 12 off the bench for Houston. Donovan Mitchell scored 31 and Jordan Clarkson had 22 for the Jazz, who cut the Rockets' lead to seven in the fourth quarter a couple times but could never get closer. The Rockets made the Jazz pay when they occasionally double-teamed Harden and couldn't rotate fast enough to the perimeter shooters. After a season high-tying 25 3-pointers in their last outing against Golden State, the Rockets made 20 of 48 from beyond the arc. ""We have two guys, even more than two guys, that are able to put pressure on the rim. Teams are going to come and help and then our shooters have open shots,"" Harden said. The Rockets made their move in the third quarter when they outscored the Jazz 38-19. ""When we don't make shots, it really impacts our defense. That said, I thought in the third quarter, we didn't have the same energy we needed on the defensive end. We didn't get our hands on balls, we didn't get deflections, and we fouled just once which tells you a little about our aggressiveness,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Westbrook capped a 14-2 run with a jumper and Houston led 100-85 entering the final period. ""It's cash money when they guard like that,"" Westbrook said. The Rockets made eight of their first nine 3-point attempts to take an early eight-point lead. Taking advantage of Houston's lack of rim protection, Clarkson scored 20 points in the first half to help the Jazz recover and move in front. The Jazz played zone defense at times along with some non-traditional defensive matchups against the small-ball Rockets. ""Every game has been different so we just need to figure out how they are going to guard us and attack it. If they trap me, we are going to get open 3s. If they play us regular, we'll run our offense and still get it,"" Harden said. If Harden and Westbrook are rolling, unique strategies don't seem to matter. ""We got two of the best 1-on-1 players in the world. What are you going to do?"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. The Jazz lost to the San Antonio Spurs on Friday night and could hardly afford another slip-up on the second half of their back-to-back as they jockey with the Rockets for playoff position in the last third of the season. Houston and Utah now both have records of 36-20 but the Rockets claimed the season series, 2-1. `D' WINS GAMES All the Rockets mentioned improved defense, especially in the third quarter, as the key to the win. The Rockets held the Jazz to 6-for-19 shooting in the third quarter and forced five turnovers. ""We took the challenge better. They were coming at us and we weren't surprised but we weren't really into them and we didn't guard as well as we could (in the second period). That's the mark of an experienced and veteran that we just came out and manned up,"" D'Antoni said. Harden agreed. ""That's what we've got to do. We've got to guard. If we guard at a high level like we've been doing, the sky's the limit for us,"" Harden said. TIP-INS Rockets: Gordon, who scored 50 against Utah on Jan. 27, returned from a three-game absence with a leg bruise. . The Rockets' 20 3-pointers gave them a 60-21 edge on shots from long range. ... Westbrook demonstratively demanded a replay on a foul by Bojan Bogdanovic early in the fourth quarter. After review, the elbow nudge was determined to be a common foul. Jazz: Rookie forward Juwan Morgan, who had never played more than seven minutes in a game, played 13 minutes against the small-ball Rockets and had career highs of four points and five rebounds. . Utah outscored Houston 64-36 in the paint. . Mike Conley had 13 points, seven rebounds and seven assists after sitting out for rest against the Spurs.","401161483"
"On March 18, 2013, LeBron James threw down this monster alley-oop slam all over Jason Terry and the Celtics. (0:31) LOS ANGELES --  Although LeBron James is still relatively new to the Los Angeles Lakers' rivalry with the Boston Celtics, he relishes the chance to participate in the history and passion behind this series. When James had the chance Sunday to make another significant mark in this chapter of NBA history, he stepped back and did it with pleasure. James scored 29 points and put the Lakers ahead on a fallaway jumper with 30 seconds to play, and Los Angeles split its season series with Boston in a 114-112 victory. James also had nine assists and eight rebounds in another superb all-around game. He missed a tying free throw moments before he coolly nailed the turnaround shot over Jayson Tatum to put the Lakers ahead to stay in their fifth straight win overall. ""I had been setting him up all night with the back-down to the drop step to the baseline,"" James said. ""I figured he would sit on it, thinking I would try it again, so I just went to my back-down, gave a little Dream Shake to the baseline and was able to open up the middle and get my fadeaway."" When Tatum was called for an offensive foul in the final second, the Lakers could celebrate another memorable meeting between two clubs with 33 NBA titles between them. James put up a triple-double when the Lakers won in Boston last season in his first taste of the rivalry, but LA had lost his ensuing two meetings with the Celtics. ""It's just special to be part of this rivalry,"" James said. ""We understand that this has been going on since the `50s, `60s, `70s, `80s, `90s, all the way through. So to be a part of a rivalry, to be a part of a historical two-franchise group, this is special. ... (We love) to represent this rivalry with the utmost respect and play this game the right way, as all the former players have done in the past."" James was thinking of Celtics great Bill Russell, who watched the game at courtside while wearing Kobe Bryant's jersey. He was also thinking of Tatum, who matched his career high with 41 points while wearing a purple wristband in memory of Bryant, a mentor and teacher to the Celtics star. ""That's a great atmosphere,"" said Boston's Jaylen Brown, who scored 20 points. ""It don't get too much better than that. To be honest, I had a great time. Even though we lost, it was fun being out there competing at the highest level, and it makes you thirsty for the postseason."" Anthony Davis had 32 points and 13 rebounds for the Lakers, who took a 32-point blowout loss in Boston last month. The Celtics had won 12 of 14 starting with that dominant win. Davis hit two free throws with 12.3 seconds left in the rematch and added one more with 6.7 seconds to play. But Tatum was called for a push-off foul as he attempted to create space for one last shot against Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Tatum scored just six points in the final 18 minutes, with Caldwell-Pope doing much of the defensive work. ""It was a step in the right direction,"" Tatum said of his performance against James and Davis. ""I definitely looked up to those guys and know how great they are individually, so just trying to earn the respect of the guys I look up to."" With the Lakers' immediate return to excellence since beating out Boston to acquire Davis last summer, these longtime rivals are both playoff-bound championship contenders yet again. Los Angeles is comfortably atop the Western Conference standings, while the Celtics sit third in the East. Both teams have a decent shot of meeting in the NBA Finals for the 13th time if they continue to grow from big games like this thriller. The Celtics played without star Kemba Walker, who missed his second straight game with left knee soreness. ""It was about who wanted it more,"" Davis said. ""With or without Kemba, they're a tough team. They've proven they can win without him. To play a team like that in a playoff atmosphere is something you want. We just stayed with it. We know how big this rivalry is."" TIP-INS Celtics: Walker's injury is ""not a long-term thing,"" coach Brad Stevens said. Walker did work in the weight room before the game. ... The bench scored just five points in the first three quarters, including only one field goal, and finished with 11 points. Lakers: James went down with the wind knocked out of him early in the fourth quarter when Daniel Theis ran into him under the basket. James stayed in the game after a timeout. ... Rajon Rondo received praise from his teammates for his stellar defensive play. He spent much of the pregame warmup chatting with Kevin Garnett, his longtime Celtics teammate. TATUM'S MOVE Tatum underlined his growing superstardom by matching the career high he set against New Orleans last month. He scored 16 points in a five-minute barrage alone during the third quarter, finishing the period with 18. Tatum said he came up for the idea for the purple wristbands along with the Celtics' equipment staff. Tatum was an enormous fan of Bryant, who shared tips about basketball and life with the young Boston star. WILD FINISH Davis' third 3-pointer put the Lakers up 108-105 with 2:08 to play, but Gordon Hayward hit a jumper before Brown's 3-pointer put the Celtics back ahead 110-108 with 1:17 to go. Boston turned the ball over with 15.5 seconds left after James' big shot, and Stevens got a technical foul for arguing about it. Davis missed that free throw, however. MARKIEFF ARRIVES About 90 minutes after the game, the Lakers announced they've signed veteran Markieff Morris and waived injured center DeMarcus Cousins. Morris will provide wing defense and rebounding in a backup role for the Lakers, who added him two days after he was bought out by Detroit.","401161484"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry and the surging Toronto Raptors tuned up for their showdown with Milwaukee by pounding the Indiana Pacers. Lowry had 16 points and 11 assists, extending his career-best streak of double-doubles to six, and Toronto hammered Indiana 127-81 on Sunday, the most lopsided victory in Raptors history. Pascal Siakam scored 21 points and Serge Ibaka had 15 points and a season-high 15 rebounds as Toronto led from wire-to-wire and posted its 13th straight home win over the Pacers. The Raptors won for the 17th time in 18 games and extended their home winning streak to nine. That streak will be tested when Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks come north of the border Tuesday night, the first of three meetings between the teams down the stretch. The NBA leaders have won seven of eight heading into Monday's game at Washington. ""They're a well-coached team, they're a well-oiled machine,"" Lowry said. ""All we can do is worry about ourselves."" Lowry's double-double was his 13th of the season. He's averaging 19.3 points and 10.8 assists over his current six-game run. ""I've never coached or seen anybody that plays as hard in basketball as that guy,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Toronto's largest lead was 49 points, its biggest of the season. The Raptors led by 40 in a home win over Utah on Dec. 1. The 46-point margin of victory surpassed a 36-point win over Charlotte on Nov. 18. Matt Thomas scored all of his career-best 17 points in the fourth quarter, Terence Davis had 13 and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson 12. Chris Boucher had nine points and 11 rebounds. Indiana's 81 points were the fewest by a Toronto opponent this season. Orlando scored 83 points in a home loss to the Raptors on Nov. 29. ""One of those nights, you know?"" Indiana's Doug McDermott said. ""They played extremely well and we probably played our worst game of the year."" Domantas Sabonis had 14 points and 11 rebounds, Aaron Holiday scored 14 points and Justin Holiday had 12 but the Pacers never recovered from an abysmal first quarter and lost for the first time in three games. Indiana has dropped seven of nine. Pacers guard Victor Oladipo sat out because of back spasms, with Aaron Holiday starting in his place. Oladipo left Friday's road win over the Knicks after three quarters because of a sore back, and didn't practice Saturday. Friday was Oladipo's first game without a minutes restriction after he missed the first 47 games of the season while recovering from a ruptured tendon in his right knee. The Pacers lost another guard with 9:54 remaining in the second quarter when Jeremy Lamb injured his left knee, landing awkwardly after being fouled by Davis on a fast-break drive. Lamb was able to shoot his free throws, but the Pacers immediately fouled to stop play and replace Lamb. He did not return. Still sore and hobbling after the game, Lamb said X-rays had come back negative, and that he will undergo an MRI Monday. ""Hopefully it's not too serious and I can get right back on the court,"" Lamb said. The Pacers missed nine straight shots to begin the game and trailed 15-3 when Malcolm Brogdon scored their first basket on a layup with 6:57 remaining in the first. Indiana missed another five shots before Justin Holiday ended his team's 0-for-7 drought from 3-point range with 3:53 to play in the opening quarter. Indiana shot 4 for 23 in the first, finishing the quarter with as many turnovers as made baskets. Siakam and Ibaka each scored 11 points for Toronto, which led 34-12 after one. ""We dug ourselves a hole and couldn't get out of it,"" Sabonis said. ""We were getting open looks, we just weren't converting even easy ones under the basket. Then, as the game went on, we couldn't even get open."" Lowry scored 11 points in the second and the Raptors led 63-32 at the half. Indiana set a season low for first-half points, four fewer than they had against Milwaukee on Nov. 16. Toronto led 85-55 heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana starters combined to shoot 1 for 13 in the first. . Justin Holiday became Indiana's first double-digit scorer when he hit a 3 with 9:45 left in the fourth. Raptors: Toronto remained without C Marc Gasol (left hamstring) and G Norman Powell (broken finger, left hand). Gasol sat for the 10th straight game, and Powell missed his eighth. . F Patrick McCaw sat for the second straight game because of flu-like symptoms. . Toronto outscored Indiana 60-30 in bench points. STARTING SLOW The Pacers have scored 27 total first-quarter points in two games following the All-Star break. Indiana trailed 20-15 after one quarter against the Knicks on Friday, but rallied to win 106-98. New York was the opponent when Indiana recorded its lowest-scoring opening quarter of the season, 11 points on Feb. 1. The Knicks won that game 92-85. KEEPING IT CLEAN Lamb said he had no problem with Davis trying to block his dunk attempt. ""I ain't upset about it,"" Lamb said. ""He tried to make a play on it and that happens all the time. He bumped me in the air and I hung on the rim. I don't think it was dirty or nothing like that.""","401161485"
"DENVER --  Paul Millsap followed one of his worst games of the season with his best, thanks to extra film sessions. Millsap scored a season-high 25 points on 9-of-11 shooting, and the Nuggets bounced back from their first loss in the Northwest Division to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 128-116 on Sunday night. Millsap had just two points in a 113-101 loss at Oklahoma City on Friday night but made a quick recovery. He hit his first six shots before missing with 54 seconds left in the first half. ""I watched a lot of film over the past few days, seeing how I can get better,"" Millsap said. ""I've been out of the lineup for a while so trying to get back in rhythm and figure things out."" Nikola Jokic was nearly as sharp, making all six of his shots in the first half and going 11 of 14 from the field. He finished with 24 points and Jamal Murray had 19 on his 23rd birthday. Denver shot 58.9% after hitting 68.2% in the first half. ""I remember looking up at one point in the first quarter with like three minutes to go and we were shooting 100%,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""I don't know if it was good offense or no defense."" The Timberwolves had only nine players available. D'Angelo Russell sat out for rest while Karl-Anthony Towns is out for at least two weeks with a hairline fracture in his left wrist. Kelan Martin had 19 of his career-high 21 points in the first half for Minnesota, which has lost 31 of its last 37. ""That group played really hard. I'm really proud of our guys,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. It was the first game in Denver for Malik Beasley and Juancho Hernangomez since the Nuggets traded them, along with Jarred Vanderbilt, to Minnesota on Feb. 6. ""It was like practice, it was weird,"" said Beasley, who finished with 17. ""It was cool to be out there and compete with those guys because we had that brotherhood for four years, so it's a weird feeling."" Beasley had 12 points at halftime but scored just five in the second half and was talking with his former teammates throughout the game. ""For some guys, that's how we were raised, talking trash (to) get me going a little more, get my juice flowing,"" Nuggets guard Monte Morris said. ""Malik's one of the trash talkers. We knew coming in he was going to be talking a lot."" Minnesota stayed with Denver despite the short rotation and led 60-56 midway through the second quarter before the Nuggets used a 15-3 run to take a 73-65 lead at halftime. They stretched it to a 10-point advantage after three and opened up a 106-91 lead early in the fourth. The Timberwolves scored nine straight to get back into it but Denver went on a 22-2 run to put it away. TIP-INS Timberwolves: The Nuggets showed a video tribute to Beasley, Hernangomez and Vanderbilt during a timeout in the first quarter. ... F Allen Crabbe was out for personal reasons. ... Saunders said he expects Russell to play Monday night at Dallas. Nuggets: The 73 points in the first half were a season high. ... Denver is now 10-1 against the Northwest Division. ... Malone said rookie Michael Porter Jr. is not fully recovered from the right ankle injury that cost him the last six games before the All-Star break. ""I think we have a locker room full of guys who aren't 100 percent,"" Malone said. ""Who is at this point of the season?"" HELLO, MY NAME IS... The Timberwolves overhauled their roster through a series of trades, leading to plenty of new faces on the team. Minnesota acquired nine different players in five trades, eight of those coming over in a 24-hour period ahead of the Feb. 6 trading deadline. That influx of talent meant integrating players on the fly, so Saunders worked his team hard recently. That led to sitting Russell for Sunday's loss. ""We have so many new guys we had almost a mid-February training camp for a day, day and a half,"" he said. ""Three heavy days and with a heavy game schedule this week tonight it was the plan for him to take it off.""","401161486"
"CHICAGO --  Coby White is taking his game to new levels -- and reaching some rarified Air. White scored 33 points to join Michael Jordan as the only Bulls rookies with 30 or more in consecutive games, and Chicago overcame Bradley Beal's career-high 53 to snap an eight-game losing streak with a 126-117 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday. Zach LaVine added 32 points and broke the franchise record for 3-pointers in a season. Chicago led by 25 early in the third quarter after scoring 15 straight, and hung on after the Wizards pulled within seven in the fourth. White wasn't picked for the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend in Chicago. But now, his name is alongside Jordan's. ""It means a lot,"" he said. ""He's the G.O.A.T. I've really got an opportunity to get better, got to build from it."" White matched the career high he set the previous night against Phoenix. He became the NBA's first rookie reserve with 30-plus points in consecutive games since the league began tracking starters in 1970-71, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He also joined Allen Iverson and Trae Young as the only rookies since 1992 with 33 or more in consecutive games. White might not be coming off the bench much longer. Coach Jim Boylen will at least consider starting him. ""We got a second group that's playing pretty good again,"" Boylen said. ""We're also melding Coby into that first group at times in the game. So, coming off two 33-point games, I don't know if it makes sense to do that. We'll examine it. We'll look at it."" LaVine made six 3-pointers to extend his career-high total to 177 and break Ben Gordon's mark of 173 in 2008-09. Thaddeus Young scored 25 while going 5 of 7 from beyond the arc, and the Bulls hit 18 of 37 on the way to their first win since they beat San Antonio on Jan. 27. As for the Wizards? ""It's pretty simple,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""We're playing soft."" He'll get no argument from Beal, who surpassed his previous best of 51 points at Portland on Dec. 5, 2017. Davis Bertans scored 22 for Washington. ""I have to agree with (Brooks),"" Beal said. ""I put myself in that group, too. I can be better on the defensive end and the all-around game. We all can be better."" TIP-INS Wizards: Centers Thomas Bryant (sore right foot) and Ian Mahinmi (sore right foot) played 14 and eight minutes, respectively. Bulls: Boylen made it clear he is not apologizing for calling timeouts late in games that are out of reach. The issue came up again in the loss to Phoenix on Saturday, when TV cameras caught LaVine showing frustration after Boylen called one with 30 seconds remaining and the Chicago trailing by 10. ""You could video me on a 2-on-1 when we turn it over and I make an expression,"" Boylen said. ""You could video me on a wide-open 3 we miss and then on the other end they make a contested 3, I make an expression. You could do that on every clip, in every situation. We were down 10, I called a timeout to coach my team. ... But I could see where people think it would be unnecessary. That's OK."" IMMEDIATE IMPACT White wasted no time taking over, pouring in 26 points as the Bulls grabbed a 73-58 halftime lead. He started a 15-0 run when he nailed his fifth 3-pointer with 34 seconds left before Tomas Satoransky drove for a layup to send Chicago to the locker room with a 15-point lead. LaVine, who scored 41 in a loss at Washington on Feb. 11, started the third quarter by nailing two 3-pointers and a free throw after Beal picked up a technical. Young finished the run with a 3 to make it 83-58. The Wizards cut it to 107-100 in the fourth quarter. It was an eight-point game when LaVine threw down back-to-back dunks to make it 119-107 with 4:13 left. QUOTABLE ""It's cool. I didn't even realize it until they said it during the game."" -- LaVine on the 3-point record.","401161487"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was surly, even by his standards, during his postgame media session. It was easy to see why. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 22 points and 13 rebounds, Steven Adams added 21 points and 14 rebounds and the Oklahoma City Thunder rolled past the Spurs 131-103. It was Oklahoma City's largest victory margin ever against San Antonio. Popovich interrupted reporters mid question and gave terse answers. About a minute into the session, Popovich asked, ""Are there any other questions that are going to amaze me, because I've got to talk to my boss."" There were no further questions. Luguentz Dort, a rookie who is on a two-way contract, scored 15 points on 6-for-6 shooting for Oklahoma City. Chris Paul added 12 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds to help the Thunder win for the 12th time in 15 games. Eight Oklahoma City players scored in double figures -- a first for the team since moving from Seattle in 2008. The Thunder had seven players in double figures on Friday in a win over Denver. ""We are playing unselfishly, and that's what Coach (Billy Donovan) is telling us to do,"" Thunder guard Dennis Schroder said. ""Just moving the ball, and people had great shots or (sometimes) good shots, you know, then passing the ball for a great shot. It's just amazing to see."" The Spurs shot just 37% from the field. Rudy Gay scored 14 points and Marco Belinelli added 13. DeMar DeRozan was held to 11 points and LaMarcus Aldridge scored just eight -- both well below their averages. The Spurs led 45-36 in the second quarter before the Thunder went on a 16-0 run. Oklahoma City led 61-55 at halftime behind 13 points from Dort. The Thunder opened the second half on an 8-2 run, and the Spurs called a timeout. The Thunder continued to roll and outscored the Spurs 37-18 in the third quarter to take a 98-73 lead. The Thunder shot 66.7% in the quarter while the Spurs shot 23.8%. Early in the fourth quarter, Adams passed behind his back to Schroder, who lobbed the ball to Adams for a one-handed throwdown that gave the Thunder a 104-77 lead. It was a tough loss for a Spurs team that was coming off a solid win at Utah on Friday. ""We have been playing well, but after that first half, it just looked like they didn't have any juice,"" Popovich said. ""And in the second half, we were behind the eight ball in a lot of different ways."" TIP-INS Spurs: Committed just one turnover in the first quarter and finished with nine. ... Shot better from 3-point range in the first half (40%) than overall (35.1%) in the first half. ... G Dejounte Murray went scoreless on 0-for-7 shooting. Thunder: Shot exactly 50% from the field in each of the first two quarters. ... Backup G Terrance Ferguson did not play in the second half due to stiffness in his lower back. ... Oklahoma City's other double-figures scorers were Schroder with 13 points, Danilo Gallinari with 12 and Abdel Nader and Nerlens Noel each with 10. ... Dort had a plus-36 plus-minus rating. SABOTAGE? Paul came close to getting the first triple-double for a Thunder player at Chesapeake Energy Arena since Russell Westbrook last April. Donovan pulled Paul with 8:25 remaining and the Thunder leading 109-81. Paul didn't know he was so close to his 16th career triple-double until after the game. ""Oh that's Billy then. Billy won't let me be great, man,"" Paul joked. ""But no, it's cool. Listen man. Me and Shai was on the bench talking about it -- that it has been a while since we had a game where we had the chance to rest. We always play close games, so I could care less. I'll take the rest."" STAT LINES Noel blocked five shots and made all five of his field goal attempts. He also committed five fouls. HE SAID IT Dort, on waiting to get a full-time NBA contract: ""Right now, I'm just staying patient. I know it's a great organization and they know what they are doing, so I'm really just staying patient and really just playing basketball and you know I can't wait until it happens for sure and that's my goal but like right now I'm really just staying patient and just really play.""","401161488"
"Stephen Curry speaks with the media about his rehab and eventual return from a broken hand. (1:43) SAN FRANCISCO --  Zion Williamson has been a dominant force on the court for New Orleans since making his NBA debut a month ago. Against Golden State, the heralded rookie made his biggest impact in the locker room with a halftime speech that provided the Pelicans with the boost they needed. Williamson had 28 points and seven rebounds, Jrue Holiday scored 11 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and New Orleans pulled away late to beat the Golden State Warriors 115-101 on Sunday. In the Pelicans locker room afterward, the topic of conversation centered around Williamson's halftime pep talk. ""It was one of those things where I just said, `Yo, we have to play with more energy. We're much better than this,"" Williamson said. ""When it comes down to it, if I say something then it means I'm into the game and something isn't right. Obviously we got the win and that's the most important part."" Williamson did enough on the court to help New Orleans snap a three-game road losing streak to Golden State. It's Williamson's eighth consecutive game with 20 or more points, the longest stretch by a rookie in the NBA this season. He was 13 of 20 and made his first 3-pointer since his NBA debut on Jan. 22. And in the short time since, he's already become an important voice on the team. ""He isn't your typical 19-year-old,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""He's a very mature kid, very respectful of his teammates and they are very respectful of him as well. He is all about winning. Just winning."" Nicolo Melli matched his career high with 20 points and six 3-pointers, and Brandon Ingram had 17 points and five assists. Damion Lee scored 22 points to lead five Golden State players in double figures. Jordan Poole added 19. The Pelicans won for the fifth time in six games after dominating the final 12 minutes. New Orleans had six 3s and two dunks in the fourth quarter while outscoring Golden State 38-24. Holiday led the late surge and got plenty of help. Melli made three 3s and Williamson added a thunderous alley-oop dunk. Williamson got off to a strong start with a pair of alley-oop dunks and a 3-pointer in the first quarter. The No. 1 overall pick scored nine of the Pelicans' first 13 points and also got a big block from behind on Warriors center Eric Paschall under the basket. ""He's explosive, strong and he knows how to play,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said of Williamson. ""He's a really great, young player without much experience at all. He's only going to get better."" Lee was just as strong for Golden State, making seven of his first nine shots to help the Warriors to a 10-point halftime lead. TIP-INS Pelicans: Derrick Favors had six points and 11 rebounds. Warriors: Draymond Green (pelvic contusion) and Marquese Chriss (left calf soreness) were held out. CURRY HAS A DATE Stephen Curry's hand injury was more serious than originally thought but he continues to target March 1 for his return after missing nearly four months with a broken left hand. The two-time MVP took part in a full contact practice on Saturday, then afterward told reporters that he had suffered nerve damage in his hand when Phoenix center Aron Baynes fell on him in a game on Oct. 30. His recovery has been going well and if things remain on schedule he hopes to play in a home game against Washington. BENDER'S BACK IN THE NBA The Warriors signed 7-foot center Dragan Bender to a 10-day contract before the game. The fourth overall pick in 2016, Bender played seven games with Milwaukee this season and also spent time in the G-League. Bender had six points and five rebounds against the Pelicans.","401161489"
"Hassan Whiteside explains that when he used Google to search the word ""bucket"", CJ McCollum's name showed up, thanks to his season-high 41 points vs. the Pistons. (0:33) PORTLAND, Ore. --  With All-Star guard Damian Lillard nursing a groin strain, the Portland Trail Blazers got big games from CJ McCollum and Carmelo Anthony. McCollum had 41 points, a career-high 12 assists and nine rebounds, Anthony scored a season-high 32 points and the Portland Trail Blazers rallied to beat the Detroit Pistons 107-104 on Sunday night. ""He led us tonight,"" Anthony said of McCollum. ""He came up big when we needed it, made the right plays, the shot was falling. He put us on his back tonight."" It was the first time Anthony scored over 30 points since Feb. 25, 2017, when he was with the New York Knicks. He made a jumper with Portland protecting a two-point lead with 21 seconds left. Anthony remained focused on the playoff fight his Blazers are in. With Portland four back in the loss column of eighth-place Memphis, Anthony knew it was up to he and McCollum to make sure the Blazers didn't take a costly loss to the lowly Pistons. ""We don't have a choice,"" Anthony said. ""We've got to go out there and do what we do to win games or put ourselves in position to win a basketball game. At the end of the day it's going to come down to us too and saying this is what we got to do. This is the last quarter of the season and we in a dog fight trying to get that spot."" Of the 27 points Portland scored in the fourth quarter, 21 came from Anthony and McCollum, who worked well together down the stretch. ""I'm very comfortable with that. I like low pick-and-rolls, side pick-and-rolls. Melo is good in isolation, he likes 15-foot jumpers,"" McCollum said. ""I know if I can turn the corner, then his man is going to be more hesitant to help. So it's either I'm going to be finishing and he's going to have opportunities to score. I think we played pretty well together and figure out ways to put the defense at a disadvantage."" Reserve big man Christian Wood had 26 points and nine rebounds for Detroit. The Pistons' bench accounted for 70 points. ""He's growing right before our eyes,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said of Wood. ""I love where he is, I love his progression but he's not a finished product yet. Christian's got to get stronger. This summer he's got to get in the weight room and get stronger in his core together so he can take some bumps and hits and still score."" McCollum scored or assisted on 14 consecutive Portland points in the first quarter and finished with 15 points and five assists in the period. The Blazers led 40-24, with Anthony adding 12 points. A dunk by Wood gave the Pistons their first lead since their opening run at 45-43 with 5:36 left. Portland bounced back enough to hold a 53-51 lead at halftime after the Pistons outscored the Blazers 27-13 in the quarter. Anthony continued his strong night in the third quarter, scoring 10 points and hitting a pair of 3-pointers but the Pistons would not relent. The Pistons scored 11 straight points in the final few minutes of the period to take a 10-point lead. McCollum scored seven straight points to close the quarter with Portland only down 85-80. A basket by McCollum put Portland ahead 99-97 with 2:49 left. After Derrick Rose's layup, another runner from McCollum put Portland up 101-99 with 2:01 remaining. McCollum hit a pair of free throws before a dunk by Wood cut Portland's lead to 103-101. An empty possession gave Detroit the ball with 45 seconds left but Rose's drive was blocked by Hassan Whiteside. A midrange jumper by Anthony after the block put Portland up 105-101. TIP-INS Pistons: Amid a barrage of changes to their roster, coach Dwane Casey has been tinkering with his starting shooting guard spot. For the past two games, he's given Svi Mykhailiuk the start over Bruce Brown. But he still sees the spot being somewhat fluid, even though Mykhailiuk got his second straight start on Sunday. ""It's relaxed Bruce to come off the bench,"" Casey said. ""He's still going to get his minutes but again, we have had trouble scoring to start the games. And that's a reason why Svi has been in there."" Trail Blazers: Despite their disappointing 128-115 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, Blazers coach Terry Stotts liked what he saw from his squad particularly in the second half. "" We did improve our transition defense and our defensive rebounding,"" Stotts said.","401161490"
"CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Cavaliers turned what looked like another lopsided loss into a stunning win Monday night. Rookie swingman Kevin Porter Jr. scored a season-high 30 points, including the go-ahead basket in overtime, and Cleveland rallied from a 22-point deficit for a 125-119 victory over the Miami Heat. Porter was 9 of 18 from the field and hit four 3-pointers in his 41 minutes on the floor. ""You can play a perfect game, but if you don't close at the end it doesn't matter,"" he said. ""We're extremely happy we could close it out."" Cleveland, which trailed 84-62 midway through the third quarter, handed the Heat their first loss in nine overtime games this season. Miami played without All-Star Jimmy Butler, who missed his second straight game because of personal reasons, but coach Erik Spoelstra wasn't interested in any excuses. ""Whoever is out there, we've got enough,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter who's out there. We've got enough to win."" Porter's dunk after a pass from Kevin Love gave Cleveland a 119-118 lead with 1:20 to play. Fellow rookie Darius Garland's runner in the lane put the Cavaliers ahead 121-118 with 40 seconds remaining. Jae Crowder missed a 3-pointer from the corner before Love scored after an offensive rebound with six seconds left and Porter hit two free throws to seal it. Miami scored one point over the final 1:44, a technical free throw by Kendrick Nunn with 1.4 seconds to play. Cleveland's comeback came with Andre Drummond and Collin Sexton on the bench. Love had 17 points and 14 rebounds as seven Cleveland players scored in double figures. Larry Nance Jr. scored 16 points and Tristan Thompson added 15. The Cavaliers played their first home game since J.B. Bickerstaff replaced John Beilein as head coach. Beilein resigned during the All-Star break. ""We're going to call on different people,"" Bickerstaff said. ""On a given night it could be your night."" Bam Adebayo had 22 points and 13 rebounds for Miami. Goran Dragic also scored 22 and Kendrick Nunn, who tied the game with six seconds left in regulation, added 21. The Heat routed Cleveland 124-105 on Saturday, a game in which Miami never trailed and led by 31 points, and appeared headed to another easy win on this night. Miami scored the first 10 points and stretched a double-figure lead until the Cavaliers rallied. Porter hit consecutive 3s to give the Cavs their first lead, 107-104, with four minutes left in regulation. Nunn's rebound basket tied the game with six seconds remaining. Porter missed a fadeaway jumper, and a rebound dunk by Nance came after time expired. The Heat, who are fourth in the Eastern Conference, fell to 13-18 on the road. ""It's our job,"" Adebayo said. ""We play on the road. We've got to figure it out. Until we figure it out, we're going to keep losing over and over."" TIP-INS Heat: F Derrick Jones Jr. started in place of Butler. ...

Cleveland made seven shots and had four turnovers in the first quarter. ... Sexton has scored in double figures in 28 straight games. DON'T ASK Dragic was given a technical foul when it appeared he bumped into Nance while play was stopped in the fourth. Love made the foul shot. Spoelstra was given a technical for complaining about a no-call in the second quarter, but thought the officiating was a non-issue. ""Who cares?"" he said. ""You could see the frustration level on both sides about that. It didn't have anything to do with the outcome of the game."" BIG ADDITION Drummond had 13 points and six rebounds in 24 minutes during his fifth game since being acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline. ""He has the ability to score without plays being called for him and that's a coach's dream,"" Bickerstaff said. ""You got a guy who can go get you 20 points and you don't have to call a play for him. Defensively, he has the impact to protect the paint.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid sank a 3-pointer for a career-high 49 points, flashed a big smile, cupped his ear to get the crowd screaming even louder and did a little dance. When the Big Man is having fun, he's almost impossible to stop. Embiid also grabbed 14 rebounds, Tobias Harris had 25 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Atlanta Hawks 129-112 on Monday night. Missing All-Star Ben Simmons for the second time in three games because of a back injury, the Sixers mixed up their starting lineup and got 15 points from Furkan Korkmaz in a reserve role. Embiid carried them. ""I said before the All-Star break I was going to have a different mindset, be aggressive,"" Embiid said. ""I said I was going to get back to having fun. Having fun comes in different forms. I don't have to always be smiling and laughing. I can have fun just dominating the game."" The Sixers need consistency from Embiid to move into position for home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. They pulled within a half-game of Miami for fourth place in the Eastern Conference following the Heat's overtime loss at Cleveland. ""With the news of Ben, he has to come out and play the way he did,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""When he comes with that activity, that mentality, that energy, he makes a statistician work and we're going to win a lot of games.""

They closed out the period with an 8-0 run and took a 92-91 lead into the fourth after Young nailed a 3. The Sixers went up to stay on four consecutive free throws by Embiid. Harris sank a 3-pointer to extend the lead to 105-98. Embiid's dunk and 19-footer put Philadelphia up by 15 with 3:08 left, and the All-Star center heard ""MVP!"" chants when he went to the foul line in the final minutes. Embiid made 14 of 15 free throws and 17 of 24 from the floor. He hit a 3 in the final minute to set his personal best. His previous high was 46 against the Lakers on Nov. 15, 2017. ""Our guys were brilliant in the third quarter to compete and take the lead,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Obviously, Joel is a handful."" Simmons played five minutes in a loss at Milwaukee on Saturday before exiting. He had tests on Sunday and needs further evaluation. Brown wouldn't speculate on the extent of the injury or how long Simmons will be sidelined. But it appears the team is preparing to play without him for a while. BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD Embiid backtracked somewhat after calling himself the best player in the world following an excellent performance last Thursday against Brooklyn. ""What I said was, All-Star game, fourth quarter, I was out there with some of the best players in the world and I'm out there just dominating, just being unstoppable, just doing whatever I want, especially in the post, so I felt that was a chance for me to prove I deserve to be in that conversation,"" Embiid said. ""If I play every night like I played tonight, what more can you say. I just got to keep on doing it. I know I'm not but I do believe it ... I got to prove it. I got to win. My goal is to win a championship. That's how you prove you're up there."" TIP-INS Hawks: The loss snapped a two-game winning streak. The Hawks haven't won three in a row all season. ...

"Bradley Beal discusses Kobe Bryant and how seeing his memorial today brought back the tears. (1:07) WASHINGTON --  Khris Middleton suddenly went cold down the stretch against the Washington Wizards. Fortunately for the Milwaukee Bucks, he kept shooting. With Giannis Antetokounmpo fouled out, Middleton bounced back from five straight misses and scored Milwaukee's final nine points and the Bucks beat Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards 137-134 in overtime. ""It was frustrating,"" Middletown said of his cold stretch from late in regulation to early in overtime. ""I thought they were easy shots, great looks that I knock down a majority of the time. Going into the timeouts, going back on defense, everybody was just telling me to keep shooting."" Middleton, who finished with 40 points, hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 30.2 seconds left to give the Bucks a 135-132 lead. After Beal -- who had his second straight 50-point game -- made two free throws, Middleton was fouled with 7.8 seconds left and made both attempts from the line to make it 137-134 and Troy Brown, Jr.'s 3-pointer rimmed out at the buzzer. ""We definitely didn't want (Beal) to take the last shot,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We feel fortunate that we made one more play than them probably down the stretch."" Beal, who had a then-career high 53 points in a loss at Chicago on Sunday, topped it with a 55-point effort that included 22 points in the fourth quarter and seven more in overtime. ""I was just locked in and I just was having fun,"" said Beal, the first player in franchise history to have back-to-back 50-point games. ""Probably the most fun game I've ever played in."" On the day of Kobe Bryant's Memorial Service in Los Angeles, Beal became the first player since Bryant in March 2007 to score 50-plus points on consecutive days. ""Oh man, that's crazy,"" Beal said. ""Didn't know that. That's who Kobe was. That was his drive and that ceremony today just brought the feeling, the tears all back again."" Shabazz Napier added a season-high 27 points for Washington, which has lost three straight. Antetokounmpo had 22 points and 14 rebounds before fouling out with 1:33 remaining in regulation for Milwaukee, which has won 17 of 19. The Wizards rallied from 17 points down to take a 123-121 lead on Beal's 3 with 1:01 remaining. Eric Bledsoe's free throws tied it and after a miss by Beal, Middleton missed as well. Felipe Lopez blocked Rui Hachimura's layup attempt off a pass from Beal with 1:0 second left and Milwaukee's alley-oop toss at the buzzer failed. ""I probably should've shot the ball at the end of (regulation),"" Beal said. ""Granted Rui (Hachimura) was wide open. I should've threw a zip pass to him. I kind of lobbed it to him, so I set him up for failure."" Middleton had a career-high 51-points in the teams' first meeting, a 151-131 Milwaukee win on Jan. 28. The Bucks led 51-49 in the third quarter when Middleton's step-back jumper started a 14-2 run. Washington rallied and Napier's four-point play made it 102-93 with 9:29 left in the game, and his layup soon pulled the Wizards within seven. Middleton scored four straight points to push the lead back to double figures, but Beal scored 17 straight Wizards points and his 3 made it 119-116 with 2:15 left. SHABAZZ BOUNCES BACK After totaling 10 points in the past two games, Napier scored 27 on 10-of-13 shooting and added seven assists. ""He hasn't played well in the last couple of games,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""I had a nice conversation with him this afternoon. We needed more. He came in and gave us more. It's just not scoring; it's playing with a force, it's playing with a presence."" TIP-INS Bucks: Tied the Cincinnati Royals (81 games from Nov. 18, 1960 -- Nov. 21, 1961) for the third longest streak of 100-point games in NBA history. ...

"NEW YORK --  The Orlando Magic were way down and in danger of falling further behind in the race for seventh place in the Eastern Conference. They turned things around with their biggest comeback of the season and hope it shows they have plenty of fight left for the final stretch. Aaron Gordon had 27 points, 10 rebounds and a big blocked shot in the final seconds, helping the Magic rally for a 115-113 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. Orlando charged back from a 19-point deficit to move within 1 1/2 games of the Nets for the seventh spot in the East. ""We're in the hunt, so this was a good win to get for us,"" Gordon said. ""I feel like we've let go of a lot of games and now it's time to get a hold of them."" Terrence Ross added 21 points and eight rebounds, Evan Fournier scored 21 and Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 10 boards for the Magic, who were superb offensively in the second half when they couldn't rely on their trusty defense to get stops. Orlando scored 74 points after halftime, sparked in part by Vucevic urging his teammates to move the ball. Ross was 8 for 9 in the second half, when he had all his points. ""Every team in our league will have really good wins this year,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""This was a really good win and we'll see, we'll see what we make of it."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 24 points and eight assists for the Nets, who had won five straight at home by double digits and appeared poised to extend that streak. ""We all know what happened. There wasn't too much to talk about,"" Dinwiddie said. ""It ain't no secret sauce. . We got to play defense."" The Nets extended their lead to 67-48 early in the third before Vucevic rebounded from a two-point first half by going 5 for 5 for 12 points in Orlando's 40-point third quarter that cut it to 87-81. Orlando then opened the fourth with a 7-0 spurt, with Ross' dunk with 10:35 remaining making it 88-87 and giving the Magic their first lead since the first quarter. Neither team led by more than four from there. Gordon's 3-pointer made it 115-111 with 1:12 to play, but Brooklyn cut it to two on Jarrett Allen's dunk. The Nets had a chance to tie, but Gordon blocked Caris LeVert near the rim with 14 seconds remaining. Brooklyn got a final chance after Orlando threw away an inbounds pass as Clifford tried to call a timeout, but couldn't get off a good shot. TIP-INS Magic: Injured F Jonathan Isaac, sidelined by a left knee injury, is with the team and Clifford said the plan is for him to travel for all road trips of more than one game. Isaac was hurt Jan. 1. ""He's feeling a lot better, so it's good to have him around,"" Clifford said. Nets: LeVert scored 19 points and Allen had 16 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Nets fell to 10-3 against Orlando at Barclays Center, still their most wins against any opponent. IRVING UPDATE Kyrie Irving still hasn't had surgery on his right shoulder that will end his first season in Brooklyn. The decision to have surgery was made last week after Irving saw a specialist, but coach Kenny Atkinson said there's a lot that goes into the timing of when the procedure will be done. ""I think you're tying to gather as much information and I know he's talking to the medical team, the performance team to find the best time, the best place, all that, best doctor,"" Atkinson said. ""And it's not even the best, it's like, what fits. And when we have more information we'll get it to you."" SLAMMING THE DOOR Gordon again said he won't enter the Slam Dunk Contest anymore at All-Star weekend after coming up short for the second time in a close contest this month in Chicago. Fans at Barclays Center taunted him at one point by chanting ""Wade don't like you! Wade don't like you!"" in reference to Dwyane Wade giving him a 9 on his final dunk that helped Miami's Derrick Jones Jr. win. ""I'm not going back there so they could rob me again,"" Gordon said.","401161494"
"HOUSTON --  For James Harden, it wasn't a choice. He had to be at Kobe and Gianna Bryant's memorial service in Los Angeles on Monday even though his Houston Rockets had a game that night. ""It was everything just to pay my respects,"" Harden said. ""To show my condolences to the family. Obviously it's a tough time for them, for the entire world, so it was a must that I be there and show my respects."" Harden, Russell Westbrook and P.J. Tucker arrived at the arena about 70 minutes before tip-off after attending the memorial service. Harden scored 37 points, and the Rockets beat the New York Knicks 123-112 for their fourth straight victory. ""It's unbelievable what he can do tired or distracted and not in his routine but he just keeps plugging away,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""That's why we value him. He doesn't miss games or minutes and he just plays."" Harden had 31 by halftime, helping Houston to a 72-57 lead at the break. He cooled down eventually, but his first-half work put the Rockets in control against the struggling Knicks, who lost their fourth in a row. He looked worn out after the game as he prepared to spend his first night at home since before the NBA All-Star Game. ""Long very, very emotional day,"" he said. Harden was asked what he'd remember most about Bryant, who was killed along with his daughter and seven others in a helicopter crash last month. ""Just his competitive spirit,"" Harden said. ""He always talked about your ... path that you're on and how there's always going to be tough times. There's going to be times when you don't want to work hard or you just don't feel like it, but those are the times you have to push through."" Harden, who had a career-high 61 points against the Knicks in January 2019, didn't score in the fourth quarter before sitting down for good with about three minutes left and the game well in hand. He also finished with nine assists and six rebounds. Westbrook was expected to play against the Knicks, but was scratched with a sore thumb. The Rockets were up still up by 15 to start the fourth quarter and pushed the lead to 111-91 with about 9 1/2 minutes left after an 8-2 run, highlighted by five points from Austin Rivers. The Knicks got 21 points from RJ Barrett, and Julius Randle added 17 points with 12 rebounds. ""You have a team that can attack you in so many different ways,"" Knicks coach Mike Miller said. ""You have to make them earn everything and I think they got too many easy ones early."" BIG-TIME BENCH The Rockets got 47 points from their reserves, led by Ben McLemore's 17. Starter Danuel House raved about the value of such contributions from the backups. ""It makes your team very dangerous,"" he said. ""If your starting five is capable of putting up points and your bench is capable (too), the team can stay consistent."" TIP-INS Knicks: G Elfrid Payton missed his second straight game with a sore right ankle. ... Dennis Smith Jr. had 15 points. ... New York made 11 of 29 3-pointers.

"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks shook off one of their most frustrating losses of the season with one of their most impressive offensive performances. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 23 points to lead seven Mavericks in double figures, and Dallas never trailed in a 139-123 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night. Dallas scored 81 points before halftime, its biggest half of the season, to help erase the sting of a controversial 111-107 loss Saturday in Atlanta that the team is appealing. The Mavericks improved to 18-5 following a loss. Luka Doncic added 20 points and could have found his way to another triple-double, but the Mavericks were able to rest most of their starters in the fourth quarter. He finished with nine rebounds and seven assists. Hardaway, Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis did not play in the final period, with teammates such as Seth Curry (19 points) and Delon Wright (16) helping to expand the lead. ""Obviously, people talk about me and KP,"" Doncic said. ""They don't talk about other players and what they do for this team, like Seth, Tim, Delon, everybody. We're a whole team together and they should be talked about more."" The reeling Timberwolves, playing without star big man Karl-Anthony Towns, lost their fifth in a row and 18th in 19 games. D'Angelo Russell led Minnesota with 29 points and Malik Beasley had 21. The Timberwolves, who turned over nine players on their roster at the recent trade deadline, have lost nine straight on the road. ""I would say it's tough because we're on the road right now,"" Beasley said. ""It's not like we're at home practicing and getting better, having a mini-training camp or anything like that. We're all learning on the fly, but at the same time we've got to hold each other accountable."" Dallas shot 56% in the first half and went 12 of 23 from 3-point range en route to an 81-65 halftime lead. The Mavericks finished the game at just over 50% from the field. ""We can be great (offensively),"" Hardaway said. ""It just comes down to making the right reads, making the right passes, getting second-chance opportunities and running the floor."" BAREA'S MILESTONE J.J. Barea played in his 627th game for the Mavericks, passing Michael Finley for fifth all-time behind Dirk Nowitzki, Brad Davis, Derek Harper and Rolando Blackman. Barea gave the team an immediate lift upon entering late in the first quarter, making a driving reverse layup followed by a 3-pointer to give Dallas its first double-digit lead at 37-27. He hit another 3 to help put the game away in the fourth quarter and finished with 12 points and eight assists. RUSSELL REBOUNDS Russell finished 10 for 20 from the field after sitting out Sunday night's loss at Denver for rest. His 29 points were the most since he joined Minnesota at the trade deadline. ""I trust what they do,"" Russell said of his load management plan. ""The performance team's great here. They're way more educated than I am in that aspect."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Of the 11 Minnesota players who took the court in the teams' last meeting on Dec. 4, only two -- Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver -- dressed for the Wolves on Monday night. Towns missed his third game in a row with a broken left wrist and the other eight are no longer with the team. ""We have in a sense nine new players in the last little bit here,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""We're trying to speed up the process with these guys, learn each other."" . Jake Layman played his first game since Nov. 18, having missed the last 40 with a left toe sprain.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Ricky Rubio always felt comfortable in Utah and hated to leave. He made sure his return was noticed. Rubio had 22 points, 11 assists and seven steals to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 131-111 victory over the reeling Jazz on Monday night. ""I know their game and I played with them for a long time,"" Rubio said, acknowledging he often knew where the Jazz wanted to go with their motion and their passes and stepped into the passing lanes. In his first game back in Salt Lake City after playing for the Jazz for two seasons, Rubio led an offense that shot 56% and seemed a step ahead of the Jazz all night. ""That's a tough game coming back here to play against your former team with so many emotions going through his mind. He dominated the game,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. Rubio used the All-Star break to get some rest and refocus. He also admitted he got extra juice in playing his former teammates. ""I haven't felt this fresh all year,"" he said. ""This was special for me."" Devin Booker had 24 points and a season-high 10 assists, Kelly Oubre scored 18 while Deandre Ayton added 16 for the Suns. ""We were moving the ball. The ball moves faster than bodies can and we took advantage of that tonight. Ricky and I both had over 10 assists and when you have two people creating like that, we were making the game easy for everyone else,"" Booker said. Donovan Mitchell scored 38 points and Bojan Bogdanovic added 16 for Utah. The Jazz made a season-high 37 free throws -- on 43 attempts -- but looked disjointed while committing 19 turnovers. The Suns made three 3-pointers in a row to get some breathing room, and then Jevon Carter made a layup and Oubre dunked to take a 99-88 lead into the fourth quarter. ""That third quarter used to be lethal for us. That used to be a thing where we come out and that's where we'd make our push. The roles have reversed,"" Mitchell said. Oubre dunked over Rudy Gobert early in the fourth quarter and let him know all about it, drawing a technical foul. ""We didn't get complacent. Once we got the lead, we kept building on it and we haven't done that a lot this year,"" Booker said. Rubio made an off-balance 3-pointer from the corner that brought audible gasps from the Utah crowd. The knock on Rubio in Utah was that he wasn't enough of a perimeter threat to keep defenses from sagging. ""It was an emotional game for him. To come out and play aggressive and play the right way is exciting for him. I know how badly he wanted this one,"" Booker said. The Suns made their first five shots and set the tone early that if the Jazz weren't going to stop their drives, they were headed for a big night. The Suns outscored the Jazz in the paint 66-42. ""It's all defense. It doesn't matter how many points you score if you can't guard anybody. We gotta go out there and do it -- myself included. No one is excluded from that,"" Mitchell said. Rubio, who also had six rebounds, had 13 points in the first half as the Suns shot 59.5 percent and matched the Jazz at 62-62 at the break. Known for their defense over the past few years, the Jazz suddenly can't stop anyone as they dropped their third straight home game for the first time since early last season. ""We're going to keep getting the same result if we don't focus and execute on the defensive end. This is a group that's done that, but that doesn't matter right now. (What) that should tell us is we're capable -- at least on some level. But, right now, that's not who we are,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. BE LEGENDARY Booker attended the Kobe Bryant Memorial in Los Angeles earlier Monday and it inspired him. ""All of those people in one building because of that man. It was a very important for all of us. I wouldn't say closure, because we're all missing a piece of us for the rest of our lives, but seeing Vanessa speak and seeing the girls there helped a lot of people,"" Booker said. Bryant would tell Booker to be legendary. That's what will motivate him as his career unfolds. ""When you are out there emulating the same moves, same approach, same mindset that he passed on to us . that sticks with you,"" Booker said. ""But it's not just basketball. `Be legendary' is a message for life."" TIP-INS Suns: Ayton got a technical foul 8:00 before halftime. ...

"Doc Rivers reflects on Kobe Bryant's celebration of life saying it was sensational and the energy in the arena was beautiful. (0:45) LOS ANGELES --  Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers served notice on Monday night just how dominant they can be with a healthy roster. Leonard scored 25 points in three quarters as the Clippers snapped a three-game losing streak with a 124-97 rout of the Memphis Grizzlies. Montrezl Harrell had 22 points for Los Angeles, which led throughout and was up by 35 early in the second quarter. ""I thought we played with high intensity. I thought our guys were excited to see everybody,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""We set the tone with our defense. With the way we can score, if we get stops, we're going to score a lot of points."" The Clippers were buoyed by the return of Paul George and Patrick Beverley. George, who strained his left hamstring again before the All-Star break, was back after missing last Saturday's game and scored seven of Los Angeles' first nine points. Beverley, who was out five games with a groin injury, had six points. George played 21 minutes and Beverley 19. Both were able to slowly work their way back into the lineup as Leonard set the tone. He had 14 points in the first quarter as the Clippers roared out to a 40-14 lead. The All-Star forward scored 10 straight, including two dunks, to extend Los Angeles' advantage to 24-6 with 3:49 remaining in the period. It was the third time this season and second against Memphis that Los Angeles put up 40 or more points in the opening 12 minutes. George scored seven of the first nine points as the Clippers shot 16 of 25 from the field in the quarter. ""I'm hoping we can keep moving forward. It's important for everyone to be able to play, know their roles and keep being consistent,"" said Leonard, who finished 10 of 17 from the field and grabbed eight rebounds in 25 minutes. The 14 points by Memphis were the fewest Los Angeles has allowed in a first quarter this season. The Grizzlies missed nine of their first 10 shots and 16 of 21 in the period while committing eight turnovers. ""That was a tough first quarter. We have to come out ready and know teams are going to get into us defensively,"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Harrell scored six straight points early in the second to give the Clippers a 49-14 cushion. They were up 66-37 at halftime after setting a season low for points allowed in the first half. ""It felt good. We came out with the right mindset,"" Harrell said. ""We are going to continue to get better as a group and as guys get healthy."" Ja Morant had 16 points and Josh Jackson scored 14 for Memphis (28-29), which has dropped three straight to fall under .500. The Grizzlies -- who are hanging onto the eighth seed in the Western Conference -- got within 24 at the end of the third quarter before the Clippers (38-19) extended their advantage to 37 midway through the fourth. ""It's a great team. I knew they were ready for us,"" Morant said. ""Obviously playoffs are on our minds but we're not living and dying with one game."" LONG DAY Rivers spent the entire day at Staples Center. He was there as part of the Clippers' contingent during the Kobe Bryant memorial service and stayed as the arena was being changed over to basketball. ""This morning was sensational. The game was great, too. It has been a good long day,"" Rivers said. ""I thought the spirit inside the arena was beautiful this morning. There were so many people from our league who you lose touch with. What this thing did was bring a lot of people back together."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Brandon Clarke played only three minutes due to right hip soreness. Clarke got the start with Jaren Jackson out the next two weeks due to a left knee sprain. Clippers: Marcus Morris Sr. got his first start with Los Angeles and scored 13 points. The eighth-year forward was acquired from the Knicks in a three-team trade on Feb. 6.

""We just wanted to come in and set a tone early,"" Sabonis said after Indiana's 119-80 victory on Tuesday night. ""From the first possession, we just made them feel us. The second unit followed in. It just went smoothly. Every night is a completely different game. You've got to just keep playing."" Sabonis had 21 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists. T.J.

Miles Bridges scored all of his 17 points in the first half and Caleb Martin had 11 for the Hornets (19-38), who have lost two in a row after a stretch of three straight wins -- all on the road. The Hornets were held to their lowest point total this season and the lowest by a Pacers opponent. The Pacers controlled much of the game without two regular starters. They were without Jeremy Lamb for the first time since a season-ending left knee injury suffered in their 127-81 loss at Toronto on Sunday. He will undergo surgery, but Pacers coach Nate McMillan said no date has yet been scheduled and Lamb could seek a second opinion first.

Indiana put the game away for good with a 12-2 run to open the second half. Warren scored on a jumper to put the Pacers ahead 81-46 with 8:43 remaining in the third quarter. It was a completely different performance after the 46-point loss to the Raptors. ""I did expect us to play better, with more urgency,"" McMillan said. ""We talked about establishing ourselves on both ends of the floor. Our intensity and our game must pick up and get to the next level. Every possession counts.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo says the Bucks being eliminated in Game 6 of the 2019 playoffs in Toronto motivated them to get the win. (1:02) TORONTO --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks took down Toronto, wiping away some of the bad memories from a painful trip north of the border in last years playoffs. Antetokounmpo had 19 points and 19 rebounds, Khris Middleton scored 22 points and the Bucks beat the Raptors 108-97 on Tuesday night in a matchup between the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Eric Bledsoe scored 17 points and Brook Lopez had 15 as the NBA-leading Bucks won their fourth straight and 18th of 20. Milwaukee (50-8) was playing the second game of a back-to-back after winning in overtime at Washington Monday. Behind by 12 points late in the second quarter, the Bucks rallied to beat the Raptors in their first game in Toronto since losing Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last May, completing a disappointing collapse after winning the first two games of that series at home. You always remember the last time you played here, the feelings you had, Antetokounmpo said. It was definitely on my mind. Antetokounmpo finished with eight assists, narrowly missing a triple-double. The reigning NBA MVP said Tuesdays game had a playoff feel to it. You expect that, Antetokounmpo said. The Bucks beat the Raptors 115-105 when the teams met in Milwaukee on Nov. 2. Theyll face each other again in consecutive games on April 1 and 3. Pascal Siakam scored 22 points and Fred VanVleet had 14 as the defending NBA champion Raptors lost for the second time in 19 games. Toronto was beaten at home for the first time since Jan. 12 against San Antonio, ending a nine-game run. It was a rough night for Raptors starters Serge Ibaka and Kyle Lowry. Ibaka made 2 of 15 shots and Lowry shot 2 for 12. Ibaka went 1 for 10 from 3-point range while Lowry was 1 for 7. Tonight it just didn't go in, Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Serga had like 21 straight great games. Youre going to have that one once in a while and tonight wasnt his night. Lowry, Terence Davis and Chris Boucher all scored 10 points for the Raptors. Toronto trailed 84-71 to begin the fourth, but Davis scored five points as the Raptors closed the gap with a 7-0 spurt over the first 90 seconds of the final quarter. VanVleets four-point play with 2:23 left cut it to 101-94, and the Raptors forced a steal on Milwaukees next possession but VanVleet missed a 3. Antetokounmpo hit a 3 at the other end, restoring the double-digit advantage. Toronto was up 51-39, its biggest lead of the game, after OG Anunoby dunked over Antetokounmpo with 2:58 to go in the second. Milwaukee closed the quarter with an 11-1 spurt, cutting the deficit to 52-50 at halftime. Obviously the end of the second quarter was really big for us, Budenholzer said. We were not having a very good half. After missing 10 of 11 attempts from 3-point range in the second, the Bucks hit three in a row from distance during their closing surge. All five of Antetokounmpos points in the quarter came during that stretch. Middleton made just one of five shots in the first half but went 3 for 3 in the third and scored nine points as the Bucks outscored the Raptors 34-19 to take an 84-71 lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee is 8-0 in the second game of a back-to-back.  C Brook Lopez returned to the starting lineup after sitting out Mondays overtime win at Washington because of a sore back.  The Bucks topped 100 points for the 82nd consecutive game but failed to score at least 110 for the first time in 19 games, snapping the longest such streak in the league this season. Raptors: C Marc Gasol (left hamstring) missed his 11th straight game while G Norman Powell (broken finger, left hand) missed his ninth. Powell is set to be re-examined next week, Nurse said  F Patrick McCaw sat for the third straight game because of flu-like symptoms but could return Friday against Charlotte, Nurse said.  Toronto made 17 turnovers, leading to 19 points for the Bucks. BOARD MAN Antetokounmpo had a season-high 20 rebounds against Philadelphia on Feb. 6. His career high is 21. T FOR TWO After Lopez was called for a technical foul in the second, Lowry was standing at the line waiting to shoot the free throw when Nurse was called for technical, wiping out Lowrys attempt. LONG DISTANCE Toronto set a franchise record with 52 3-point attempts. Lets say 40 of them were probably decent, Nurse said. The Raptors made 18 shots from beyond the arc. Siakam led the way, going 5 for 9.","401161500"
"CHICAGO --  When it comes to close games on the road, the Oklahoma City Thunder like their chances. It helps to have a pair of guards like Chris Paul and Dennis Schroder. Schroder scored 21 points and made a huge defensive play in the fourth quarter, helping the Thunder top the Chicago Bulls 124-122 on Tuesday night for their fourth consecutive win. Oklahoma City (36-22) blew a 24-point lead but recovered in time to earn its ninth straight victory on the road, breaking a Thunder record. Danilo Gallinari scored 24 points, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 21 points and 11 rebounds, and Paul finished with 19 points and nine assists. ""I think they understand that it's just not going to be smooth sailing on the road. There's going to be challenges,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said, ""and I think that when it gets hard, our guys really, really kind of pull together."" The Thunder also improved to 17-9 in games decided by six points or less. ""We looked up at the clock around five minutes and we (were) like `All right, let's get to it,"" Paul said. ""Some of the better teams that I've been on, you sort of had that mentality."" Gallinari's driving dunk put Oklahoma City ahead to stay with 1:39 left. Schroder then drew a charge on Zach LaVine and Paul converted a layup to give the Thunder a 117-114 lead with 1:03 remaining. Schroder also had nine points in the final period on 3-for-5 shooting. ""Every game we're playing, we think we can win the game,"" he said. ""So if it's a close game, you know, everybody's engaged, try to get stops and that's what we did tonight."" Chicago had one more chance in the final seconds, but LaVine missed a 3-point attempt as time expired. The Bulls wasted a pair of stellar performances from LaVine and rookie reserve Coby White. LaVine scored 27 of his 41 points in the second half, and White had a career-high 35 in his third consecutive game over 30 points. Chicago (20-39) lost for the ninth time in 10 games. ""Teams are jumping on us, and we're not responding,"" LaVine said. ""Then we figure it out, but sometimes, it's too little, too late."" Oklahoma City committed 26 turnovers and trailed by as many as 26 in a 109-106 win over Chicago on Dec. 16. The Paul-led rally helped kick-start the Thunder season. This time, Oklahoma City got off to a fast start. Led by Gallinari, the Thunder opened the game with a 20-4 run. They went 11 for 17 from 3-point range and led by as many as 24 on their way to a 72-55 lead at the break. ""We had a frustrated group at halftime and they responded, and I'm happy about that,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. TIP-INS Thunder: F Darius Bazley missed his fifth straight game with a bruised right knee. Donovan said there is no timetable for his return. ... It was Oklahoma City's highest-scoring first half of the season. ... Gallinari went 5 for 10 from beyond the arc in his team-best fourth game with at least five 3s. Bulls: Shaquille Harrison scored 11 points, and Tomas Satoransky had 10 points and seven assists. ... The Bulls shot 53.6% (52 for 97) from the field. WORTH NOTING LaVine and White became the second pair of Chicago teammates to score at least 30 points in consecutive games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, joining Bob Love and Chet Walker in 1969. White became the first reserve in team history to collect 30-plus points in three straight games. ""All the hard work is paying off, I guess,"" White said.","401161501"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic could hardly recall the last time the Denver Nuggets were at full strength. Now that they are healthy again, he instantly remembered just what a force they can be. Jerami Grant scored a career-high 29 points and Jokic had a season-best four steals to help the healed-up Nuggets beat the Detroit Pistons 115-98 on Tuesday night. ""As long as we keep it like this, we're going to be good,"" Jokic said. At 40-18, the Nuggets, even through an array of injuries, are tied for their best start through 58 games in their NBA franchise history. They had the same mark a season ago on their way to winding up with the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Jokic added 16 points in a game where Denver led by as many as 15 points in the third quarter, had it cut to single digits and pulled away in the fourth to remain the second seed in the West. With his roster finally given a clean bill of health, coach Michael Malone is trying to find enough minutes for everyone. Jokic and Jamal Murray had nothing to worry about with each logging quality minutes. Grant is certainly making a strong case for more playing time after shooting 12 of 16 from the floor. His previous best was 28 points on April 10, 2019, against Milwaukee while with Oklahoma City. ""We've got a lot of talent, a lot of players that can put up 25 points a game,"" Grant said. ""You never really know where it's going to come from on any given night."" Murray remains hot since returning from a left ankle injury earlier this month, finishing with 16 points, eight assists and just one turnover. Derrick Rose and Christian Wood each had 20 points for Detroit. Rose has now scored 20 or more points a team-high 25 times this season. The Pistons dropped their seventh straight in falling to 2-8 in February. One of those wins, though, was an overtime victory against a depleted Denver squad on Feb. 2 in which Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson combined for 41 points. Both are now elsewhere: Drummond was traded to Cleveland, while Jackson was bought out of his contract and then signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. Now, coach Dwane Casey is trying to find some chemistry. He found it in spurts despite not having Bruce Brown, who was a scratch with left knee soreness. ""You can't have the, `Oh, my bads.' We had way too many, `Oh, my bads,"" Casey said. ""We had people wide open all over the place, and missed some kick-outs and against a team like this they're going to convert on those when you make those types of mistakes."" Denver threatened to run away with the game on several occasions, but the Pistons always bounced right back. A pair of dunks by Grant early in the fourth gave the Nuggets some needed separation. He scored 14 of his points in the final quarter, including two 3-pointers. ""I love that he's on my team,"" Jokic said of Grant. TIP-INS Pistons: F/C Thon Maker turned 23 on Tuesday. ... G Khyri Thomas was active after being recalled from Grand Rapids of the G League. Thomas, who hasn't played with the Pistons since Nov. 6 because of a right foot injury, had three points in nearly 14 minutes. Nuggets: Malone used his challenge at 6:22 of the first quarter after Jokic was called for an offensive foul. The play was overturned following a review. FIRST POINTS Pistons big man Donta Hall had a memorable first half as he scored his first NBA points on a pair of free throws. Hall signed a 10-day contract over the weekend. ""Just bringing my energy up and down the floor,"" Hall said. BOL BOL UPDATE Nuggets rookie center Bol Bol took the court about two hours before the game to practice his 3-point shot. Bol, who's currently sidelined with a left foot injury, has yet to play for the Nuggets this season. Malone views Bol's rookie season much like that of Michael Porter Jr. a season ago, when Porter sat out with a back injury. ""Overall, I think Bol has really responded,"" Malone said. HIGH PRAISE Casey spoke highly of the Jokic-Murray combination. ""Two superstars,"" Casey said. ""We don't have anyone like Jokic. We don't have anyone like Murray. I'm not ashamed to say that. We're working to get there.""","401161502"
"LeBron James says he has been a wreck emotionally since the celebration of life for Kobe and Gianna Bryant. (2:00) LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James sees a long, prosperous future ahead of Zion Williamson and the up-tempo New Orleans Pelicans. In the immediate present, James and Anthony Davis are a whole lot closer to basketball's ultimate goal, as they proved in their first meeting with their fellow No. 1 overall draft pick. James had 40 points and eight rebounds in his first career meeting with Williamson while leading the Los Angeles Lakers to their sixth straight victory, 118-109 over New Orleans on Tuesday night. Williamson had 29 points and six rebounds in his first showdown with James and Davis, his predecessor as the Pelicans' centerpiece. James and Williamson still haven't talked, but the 35-year-old James sees greatness in the teenager. ""He's playing exceptional basketball,"" James said. ""I think his game is going to get better and better, just having that experience. I think today's game is the perfect fit for his game. The high pace, the way they play, it fits his game. ... It works perfectly, and our game is so many possessions now, so much space, it's perfect for his game, so he's doing exceptionally well with that."" Williamson was still injured for the Pelicans' first two meetings of the season with the Lakers, but his delayed debut in Hollywood was as entertaining as everyone hoped. In his 13th NBA game, Williamson scored at least 20 points for the ninth consecutive time, but managed only one field goal in the fourth quarter. ""It was a great experience,"" Williamson said. ""He's an incredible player. His resume speaks for himself. ... He handled business. He came out here and did what he had to do to help his team get the win."" The Lakers still haven't lost to the team with which they made the blockbuster summer trade that has appeared to benefit both teams. Davis has been just as good as the Lakers hoped in propelling them back to NBA championship contention, while the Pelicans are getting an All-Star season from Brandon Ingram alongside Williamson in an increasingly potent core. Davis had 21 points, 14 rebounds and six blocked shots while improving to 3-0 against New Orleans. Davis and Williamson briefly were theoretical teammates during the time between the draft and Davis' departure for the Lakers, and Williamson admitted he entertained the idea they might play together, even though Davis had requested a trade. ""He's a great player,"" Davis said of Williamson. ""He's got a quick first step. Very explosive. He's going to continue to get better and better as he goes on."" Although Davis missed 15 of his 21 shots and failed to score 40 points against New Orleans for the first time, James picked him up with a masterfully efficient, 17-for-27 performance that included five 3-pointers. In the Lakers' first game after an emotional memorial service for Kobe Bryant at Staples Center on Monday, James opened up a close contest with back-to-back buckets at the rim with about three minutes left. Danny Green sealed it for Los Angeles with his fifth 3-pointer with 51 seconds to play. Ingram had 34 points against his former team, but just six in the final period as New Orleans lost for only the second time in seven games. Williamson had several impressive dunks in his usual fearsome floor game, and only six missed free throws kept him from surpassing his career high of 32 points. ""(James) might see himself a little bit in Zion, the way they both came in with all the hype,"" Lonzo Ball said of his former and current teammates. ""I think Bron goes out there and plays his game every night no matter who's the opponent."" TIP-INS Pelicans: These teams will complete their four-game season series Sunday in New Orleans. ... UCLA product Jrue Holiday had 11 points and nine assists, but went 5 for 19 from the field. Lakers: Davis gave the Lakers a scare midway through the fourth quarter when he appeared to hit his left hand on the glass while blocking Nicolo Melli's shot. The oft-hobbling superstar stayed in the game after getting treatment during a timeout. Davis apparently had dinged his hand on the Lakers' previous offensive possession as well. ... Davis is the leading scorer and rebounder in New Orleans franchise history, making six All-Star teams during his tenure. EX-LAKERS Ball had 10 points, eight assists and eight rebounds, and Josh Hart scored three points in their second return to face the Lakers, who traded them to New Orleans along with Ingram last July for Davis. BALD MAMBA STRIKES AGAIN Alex Caruso provided the Lakers with his usual injection of energy in the fourth quarter, particularly with a stunning block of Ball's shot at the rim that left Ball flat on his back. Caruso finished with eight points and eight assists, including a beautiful between-the-legs drop pass to James for a dunk in the first half. ""We play so well together,"" James said. MARKIEFF'S MOMENT Markieff Morris made his Lakers debut with four points and three fouls in 15 minutes. Los Angeles signed the veteran on Sunday for the playoff push after Detroit bought him out. Coach Frank Vogel plans to ease Morris into the rotation, which he says is already stacked with more quality players than he can use extensively. Morris is expected to see regular time as a backup power forward who can rebound and play solid defense. ""It means everything to be in the purple and gold,"" said Morris, who acknowledged being exhausted after several days of personal upheaval. ""Putting on this jersey is really special.""","401161503"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Jayson Tatum's 3-point practice showed against the Trail Blazers. Tatum had 36 points, including a career-high eight 3-pointers, and the Boston Celtics beat Portland 118-106 on Tuesday night. ""That's a shot I've been working on a lot,"" Tatum said. When those guys are coming at you at 7 feet it makes it tougher. Sometimes it goes in, sometimes they block it. Jaylen Brown added 24 points for the Celtics, who sit in third in the Eastern Conference behind the first-place Milwaukee Bucks and the Toronto Raptors. Tatum had 26 points in the second half alone as the Celtics built a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter. The Blazers, playing without All-Star Damian Lillard, couldn't keep up. All of Tatum's points came from the floor, as he did not go to the line once in the game. It was the third time in four games that Tatum has scored more than 35 points, and it was his 10th 30-point game this season. When really good players see the ball go in a couple of times then the tough shots become a little easier, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. He's in a good rhythm, obviously. Brown was more emphatic about his teammate: Right now he's playing unreal. He's playing the best ball of his career. CJ McCollum had 28 points and 10 assists for the Trail Blazers. Hassan Whiteside added 18 points and 19 rebounds. We have to be better than we were tonight against teams like the Celtics to win, McCollum said. That was the difference. They played better than us. They're a deep team. They made shots, they got stops, they ran on our turnovers and they played like a playoff team. Portland, which went to the Western Conference finals last season, is in a group behind the Grizzlies wrestling for the eighth spot. The Blazers were without Lillard for the third straight game because of a groin injury that kept him out of the All-Star Game. Lillard has said he expected to miss up to five games. McCollum has been standing in for Lillard at point guard. In the first two games without Lillard, McCollum had a combined 68 points, 22 assists and 15 rebounds. The Celtics (40-17) were without guard Kemba Walker for the third straight game. Walker, averaging 21.8 points and five assists, hasn't played since the All-Star Game because of a lingering knee injury. The Blazers (26-33) were coming off a 107-104 victory over Detroit on Sunday, after a three-game losing streak. The Celtics, who rebounded from a 114-112 loss at the Lakers on Sunday, had split their last four games. The Blazers jumped out to a 17-12 lead but the Celtics caught up quickly and went ahead on Tatum's 3-pointer. Boston led 28-24 after the first quarter, led by Marcus Smart with three 3-pointers. The Celtics stretched the lead to as many as 11 points but Portland closed the gap to 47-44. Brown answered with a 3-pointer and Tatum dunked to extend Boston's lead. The Celtics went into the half ahead 56-48, led by Brown with 15 points. Tatum's long 3-pointer put Boston up 98-79 in the final quarter. He had another 3 that made it 111-94 with just under 3 minutes left that sent the Moda Center crowd streaming to the exits. After the game, Tatum exchanged jerseys with Blazers forward Carmelo Anthony. Tatum said earlier that he's looked up to Anthony. The feeling was mutual. He's a guy that's establishing himself, as we're all witnessing, all watching, Anthony said. I mean, I love his game, I love watching him play. TIP-INS Celtics: Former Blazer Enes Kanter was greeted with warm applause when he subbed in early in the game. ... The Celtics lost both games against the Blazers last season. ... Robert Williams, who has been out since December with a left hip bone edema, could be close to returning, but will be evaluated in Boston when the Celtics return home later this week. Trail Blazers: Portland big man Jusuf Nurkic, who has not played this season while he recovers from a broken leg, will accompany the Blazers on their upcoming three-game road trip. Coach Terry Stotts warned not to make too much about the trip: Nurkic's return is not imminent. LILLARD'S AVAILABILITY Stotts said its unclear when Lillard would return. The coach also said the team was still discussing whether Lillard would accompany the team on the upcoming road trip.","401161504"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  The Sacramento Kings came out of the All-Star break knowing they had little margin for error if they wanted to make a playoff push. Three straight wins to begin the stretch run has them creeping back into contention. Harrison Barnes and De'Aaron Fox each scored 21 points and the Kings beat the Golden State Warriors 112-94 on Tuesday night for their ninth win in the past 13 games. ""It's a big goal,"" coach Luke Walton said about making the playoffs. ""But the way you achieve a big goal is by focusing on the present and what we're working on, and showing up and playing a certain style every night. If we do that, we'll give ourselves a better chance to achieve the big goal at the end of the day."" The Kings still have plenty of work to do to reach that level, as they still trail Memphis by four games in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But after losing 15 of 18 games during a stretch in December and January, even having a shot at it is an achievement. ""I think we're playing well on both sides of the ball,"" Fox said. ""Things have been going good for us. We've been able to get stops when we needed them. ... We're playing our best basketball of the season."" Buddy Hield made five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter on the way to a 19-point night and Bogdan Bogdanovic had 17 to give the Kings their third straight win. Marquese Chriss scored 21 points and Andrew Wiggins added 16 for Golden State. The Warriors have lost seven straight overall and seven in a row at home for the first time since dropping the final seven home games in the 2000-01 season The Kings raced out to an early lead behind 14 points in the first quarter from Barnes and never trailed on the way to their third win in as many meetings this season with the Warriors. This is the longest winning streak in the Northern California series for Sacramento since winning 15 in a row from 2000-03. The Kings extended the lead to 16 points in the second quarter before the Warriors chipped into it. They got the deficit down to four multiple times in the third but never could get over the hump. ""The beginning of the game put us in the hole,"" Chriss said. ""It's hard to fight up stream for 48 minutes. We need to have a better start."" TIP-INS Kings: Fox left the game in the first quarter with tightness in his right groin but returned to the game in the second quarter. ... The Kings shot just 19 of 34 from the foul line. ... Walton said F Richaun Holmes (shoulder) looked good in the weight room but had no update on when he'd be able to return to practice. Warriors: After missing their first 17 3-point attempts last month in a loss at Sacramento, the Warriors made just 1 of 17 from long range in the first half. Golden State finished the game 4 for 28 from 3. ... F Draymond Green remained sidelined with a pelvic injury but should be able to return Thursday. CURRY'S RETURN Stephen Curry is aiming to return to the Warriors lineup on Sunday for the first time since breaking his left hand in October. Coach Steve Kerr that the hope is that Curry will be able to play against Washington on Sunday. Curry has been practicing in recent weeks and will be re-evaluated on Saturday before a final decision is made. ""He's had that date in his mind,"" Kerr said. ""He'll continue to work this week and we'll make that determination on Saturday.""","401161505"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Hornets coach James Borrego wants Devonte Graham to finish his second NBA season strong, rather than limping down the stretch. That's why Borrego gave Graham the night off Tuesday, in hopes that he would benefit from extra rest -- physically and emotionally -- during a season in which he ranks in the top 10 in the NBA in minutes played and has been a focal point of the offense. Terry Rozier scored 26 points, Graham responded after his night off by scoring 21 points and Charlotte handed the New York Knicks their fifth straight loss 107-101 on Wednesday night. P.J. Washington and Bismack Biyombo each scored 12 points for the Hornets. Earlier Wednesday, Hornets guard Malik Monk was suspended without pay for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA anti-drug program. The suspension will continue until he is determined to be in full compliance with the program. Graham said sitting out the Hornets' loss at Indiana was tough on him because he's a competitor, but may have been a good idea. ""I have definitely not been playing up to how I should be,"" Graham said. ""I think it's just trying to get back mentally, get a little rest, recover, try and get my mind off everything and come back and compete at a high level."" Graham didn't get much rest during All-Star week, participating in the 3-point contest and Rising Stars game. While he's been a contender for the league's most improved player, he had struggled to find his shot in recent weeks. He bounced back against the Knicks, connecting on 7 of 18 shots from the field, including two 3s. ""His usage rate has been so high that sometimes there does need to be reset,"" Borrego said. ""He's played every game with high minutes. He looked much fresher mentally and physically tonight."" Julius Randle finished with 18 points and nine rebounds for the Knicks. The Hornets led by 15 points in the second half before Bobby Portis began to rally the Knicks with a series of mid-range jumpers. Portis had 12 points of his 17 points in the second half, but New York couldn't get any closer than two with 2:43 remaining. Allonzo Trier had a chance to tie the game with 1:12 remaining but missed an open look from the corner. Rozier followed with a driving reverse layup that hit near the top of the glass and bounced around the rim and in, pushing the Hornets' lead to five with 30 seconds left. Mitchell Robinson cut the lead to two with a dunk off a pick-and-roll, but Rozier knocked down two free throws with 17 seconds left and the Hornets held on. ""I'll give the guys credit for the battle back and the way that they did to get back in it,"" said Knicks coach Mike Miller. ""But we have to understand this is a 48-minute game and you're going to have to play both halves and you're going to have to play every quarter. We've got to be a lot sharper early."" TIP INS Knicks: Mitchell Robinson had 12 points and 15 rebounds off the bench. ... Shot 4 of 15 from 3-point range. Hornets: James Borrego gave Cody Zeller the night off, part of what will be a rotation at center moving forward with Biyombo and Willy Hernangomez. ... Miles Bridges had an incredibly athletic one-handed put-back dunk in which he seemed to levitate in the air for several seconds to grab the rebound and slam it home. MONK SUSPENSION Hornets coach James Borrego said guard Malik Monk has the ""full support"" of the Hornets organization following his suspension. Monk was averaging 18.2 points in the last seven games. KNICKS BENCH If there was a bright spot for the Knicks, it was the play of their bench, which outscored the Hornets 57-26. ""We just try to go out there and try to bring us back,"" Portis said. ""We have one job, like always: come in and just try to build the game, try to bring energy and that's our one job."" TRIER SEES ACTION Trier has been buried on the Knicks depth chart all year, but had 16 points and four assists against the Hornets. ""If my number is called, I have to come in and be productive,"" Trier said. ""But if it's not then I have to be supportive of my teammates, try to help in different ways, tell them what I am seeing and doing those different things.""","401161506"
"CLEVELAND --  The Philadelphia 76ers suddenly have a lot more to worry about than their poor road record or playoff seeding. Their star players are getting hurt. Joel Embiid left Wednesday night's 108-94 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers with a sprained left shoulder in the first quarter and didn't return. The All-Star center scored three points in 8 minutes. The 76ers, already playing without All-Star guard Ben Simmons, never led against the team with the worst record in the Eastern Conference and fell to 9-21 on the road. Embiid had his left arm in a sling and was in visible discomfort following the game. He declined to talk to reporters and had an equipment manager carry his backpack out of the locker room, where the quiet atmosphere summed up the team's mood. The Sixers are fifth in the conference. Coach Brett Brown said he didn't know how long Embiid, who scored a career-high 49 points Monday against Atlanta, will be sidelined. ""I'm really unsure,"" Brown said. ""It's not coach-speak, but this is part of the NBA landscape. That's why you try to accumulate talent and depth."" Al Horford said his team had a difficult time adjusting without Embiid, who averages 23.8 points and 12 rebounds. ""Obviously, we play through him and once he was out, we didn't really know what was next,"" said Horford, who scored 10 points. ""We didn't quite know how to play. We have to figure out how to play without him."" Embiid collided with Cavaliers center Ante Zizic while being fouled late in the first quarter. The 7-footer held his shoulder in obvious pain but stayed in the game and missed both free throws. The Sixers pulled Embiid at the next time stoppage and he walked to the locker room while rubbing his shoulder. He briefly returned to the bench in the second quarter, but went back for more evaluation and treatment. At halftime, Embiid rejoined his teammates on the bench with a wrap on his injured shoulder. Brown, sensing his team was in early trouble, called timeout two minutes into the game, but Cleveland steadily built its lead. The Cavaliers shot 58% in the first half and led 70-50 midway through the third quarter. Philadelphia cut the lead to 85-80 in the fourth, but got no closer. Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr., who had 13 points and 15 rebounds, said Embiid's absence made a difference. ""You never want to see that,"" Nance said. ""He's one of the best, most dominant players in this league. Anytime he's not there, same with Ben, is important."" Collin Sexton scored 28 points for Cleveland, which had five players in double figures. Tristan Thompson had 14 points and 13 rebounds. Cavaliers center Andre Drummond didn't play because of a strained left calf. Shake Milton, who replaced Simmons in the Sixers' lineup, scored 20 points. Furkan Korkmaz scored 14 points and Alec Burks had 13. Simmons missed his second straight game because of a nerve impingement in his lower back. The team hasn't given a timeline on when he'll be back. After hosting New York, Philadelphia will begin a four-game trip in Los Angeles on Sunday. Philadelphia is fifth in the Eastern Conference. The Cavaliers are 3-1 under coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who took over when John Beilein resigned during the All-Star break. TIP-INS 76ers: The NBA fined Embiid $25,000 on Wednesday after he made an obscene gesture on the court and used profane language during a live television interview Monday. ... Tobias Harris scored 11 points. Cavaliers: Drummond is considered day to day. ... Bickerstaff said G Dante Exum will miss an ""extended period of time"" because of a sprained left ankle. Exum was injured Monday. MOVING ON Philadelphia trails Miami by a half-game for fourth in the conference. ""When you don't have Joel and you don't have Ben, it's an opportunity for guys to raise their hand up -- and we didn't have that tonight,"" Brown said. ""We've got to find ways to move forward and improve."" MAKING PROGRESS The Cavaliers are showing signs of improvement despite their 17-41 record. ""There's been a concerted effort, to a man, to go out and get after it a little bit harder,"" Bickerstaff said. ""There's an energy that's building and you don't want to be the one guy that's not participating in it.""","401161507"
"WASHINGTON --  The Brooklyn Nets didn't want Bradley Beal to beat them with the game on the line Wednesday night. Beal was happy to let Jerome Robinson take care of it. Robinson's 3-pointer -- off an assist from Beal -- with 8.4 seconds left lifted the Washington Wizards to a 110-106 win over the Nets, snapping a three-game losing streak. ""I had a really good look,"" Robinson said. ""At that point, when I see it's wide open I've got to take it. I knew they were playing (Brad) heavy. It would have been tough to get him back the ball."" After consecutive games of 53 and 55 points, Beal led the Wizards with 30 points, including 17 in the fourth quarter, but didn't hesitate to set up Robinson, who the Wizards acquired from the Clippers on Feb. 6. ""We'd been telling him all night,"" Beal said. ""There was a few he was hesitating. We didn't bring him over here for no reason. We need (him) to help us in all facets of the game. He's a good defender, but he's a pretty talented offensive player too. ""I trust everybody in here. There's a reason coach has you out on the floor."" Said Brooklyn's Chris LeVert: ""Kid hit a big shot. We didn't want Brad to beat us. ... Robinson hit the big 3, obviously. I think if we would have done it differently, we would have talked better on the switch. But we have to live with that."" After Robinson gave Washington a 108-106 lead, Brooklyn's Spencer Dinwiddie missed a 3-point attempt and Robinson got the rebound, was fouled and added two free throws as Washington won a game in which it squandered an 18-point lead. ""I thought Spencer had a great look,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We got the switch we wanted, got the step-back. Had plenty of time and space, but it didn't go in. Sometimes, that's what it comes down to."" Caris LeVert led Brooklyn, which has lost three of four, with 34 points, and Dinwiddie added 18. DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 16 rebounds. Beal tied it it at 103 with a 3-pointer at the 1:02 mark and Dinwiddie hit one of two free throws. Thomas Bryant's free throws gave Washington a 105-104 lead with 29 seconds left and Dinwiddie's driving layup put Brooklyn up by one. The ninth-place Wizards trail the seventh-place Nets by five games in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards shot 50 percent (9 for 18) from 3-point range in the first half and led by 18 points after Napier's 3 with 6:51 left in the second quarter. The Nets trailed by 13 at halftime, but rallied. LeVert (13 points in the quarter) tied it at 79 with a 3 and Garrett Temple's 3-pointer gave Brooklyn its first lead at 84-81 with 31 seconds left in the third. FIRST-HALF FUTILITY Brooklyn made just 6 of 19 3-point attempts and shot 29 percent (16 for 41) overall before intermission and committed 11 turnovers. ""I am dumbfounded by how we weren't mentally into the game,"" Atkinson said. ""I am not taking anything away from Washington. But there were just some infantile mistakes out there in terms of the turnovers."" OLD SCHOOL DEFENSE In an effort to stop Beal in the fourth quarter, the Nets employed a box-and-one defense with former Wizard Temple guarding Beal. ""I said, `I can't believe you guys are in this damn box-and-one. Is this high school out here, what are we doing?' (Temple) was like, `I'm not letting you score 50.' So, to each his own,"" Beal said. ""I guess the league don't want me to score 50, either. I got drug-tested today."" TIP-INS Nets: Wilson Chandler (personal reasons) was ruled out. Atkinson said his absence would not be long term. ... Jordan recorded his 11th double-double. ... LeVert has scored 20 or more points in six of eight games since being reinserted into the starting lineup. Wizards: Davis Bertans (sore right knee) returned after missing one game and scored 14 points. ... Improved to 15-2 in the past 17 meetings with Nets. ... Beal has 25 or more points in 16 straight games.","401161508"
"ATLANTA --  The Orlando Magic are hardly a championship contender. They're not even a .500 team. No wonder they're relishing the chance to be part of a playoff race. Evan Fournier scored 28 points, Aaron Gordon added 25 and the Magic pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 130-120 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. Orlando improved to 26-32 with its second straight road victory, maintaining a 4 1/2-game lead for the final playoff spot in the East and closing within a half-game of Brooklyn for the No. 7 seed. ""It's a lot of fun,"" said James Ennis III, who hit a key 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter after the Hawks had closed to 111-107. Ennis' lone 3 of the night sparked a 17-7 spurt that put the Hawks away. Fournier did most of the heavy lifting, scoring nine points in the game-clinching run before Gordon finished it off with a 3-pointer. ""My teammates were finding me,"" said Gordon, who also had 10 rebounds, six assists and three blocks. ""We're playing more together. We're playing smarter, more disciplined."" The Hawks lost despite a 37-point effort from Young. John Collins added 26 points, but was blocked twice in the fourth quarter -- first by Gordon, then by Nikola Vucevic -- to stymie any hopes of an Atlanta comeback. Battling flu-like symptoms and held to six points in the opening quarter, Young ripped off 20 in the second -- including a 3-pointer from inside the edge of the Hawks logo at center court. Gordon countered with an 18-point third quarter, highlighted by a 360-degree dunk off a sloppy Atlanta turnover, that sent the Magic to the final period with a 103-95 lead. ""We let the foot off the pedal a little bit,"" Collins said. ""We didn't play with the same intensity in the third quarter."" The Hawks were leading 75-68 early in the third when Orlando suddenly seized control with a 29-9 outburst. ""The third quarter was brutal,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""The first timeout is called, and we just kind of fell apart the rest of that third quarter. It's really our defensive end. We just couldn't get stops."" The ailing Young looked exhausted by the end. He made only 2 of 14 shots in the second half. ""I'm not feeling too well right now,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I'll get over this soon."" TRAE STUFFS BAMBA Young did have something to smile about after the game. Late in the first quarter, as 7-footer Mo Bamba was going up for an apparent dunk, the 6-foot-1 Young came in from behind to swat the ball away. Talk about an unlikely block. ""Mo's my guy,"" Young said with a sly grin. ""I'm talking trash with him all the time, really since high school. I'll definitely be talking about this one for a long, long time."" TIP-INS Magic: Fournier totaled 14 points in the final quarter. ... Orlando finished 2-2 in its season series against the Hawks, after winning all four meetings a year ago. ... Vucevic had 17 points and 12 rebounds. ... The Magic had nine blocks, including four from Bamba and three by Gordon. ... Orlando came to life offensively in the second quarter, scoring more points (25) in the first six minutes of the period than it did in the entire opening stanza (23). Hawks: C Dewayne Dedmon was a late scratch because of a sore right elbow. ""We didn't know about it until right before the game,"" Collins said. ""We definitely missed his defensive presence."" ... Rookie Bruno Fernando took Dedmon's place in the starting lineup, scoring 10 points and grabbing nine rebounds. ... The Hawks lost for only second time in their last eight home games. ... Young was 4 of 12 from 3-point range.","401161509"
"MIAMI --  The Miami Heat get leads. They just can't hold them. And this time, the Minnesota Timberwolves were the beneficiaries of another late-game collapse. Jordan McLaughlin's layup with just under nine seconds left put Minnesota ahead for good, D'Angelo Russell led all scorers with 27 points and the Timberwolves added to Miami beat the Heat 129-126 on Wednesday night. The Wolves were down by 12 with 3:59 left, staring squarely at what was about to be their 19th loss in their last 20 games. That is, until a 20-5 run to end the game slapped the win out of Miami's hands. ""You just can't say enough about the group in the locker room,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""It's a special group the way these guys are pushing through a lot of unknowns, a lot of change, a lot of adversity right now so I'm just really thrilled for this group."" Malik Beasley scored 21 points, Juancho Hernangomez tied a season-high with 17 and McLaughlin added 13 for Minnesota. Jimmy Butler's two free throws with 13.8 seconds left put Miami up 126-125, but McLaughlin's layup on the next Minnesota possession put the Timberwolves on top to stay. Butler's layup with 3.2 seconds left got blocked by Russell, and the Wolves held on. ""We just don't know,"" Heat guard Goran Dragic said. ""This is the time we need to win. The playoffs are around the corner. It's just frustrating. Feels like we're not the same team that we were in the first half of the season."" Kendrick Nunn led Miami with 24 points. Bam Adebayo had 22 points and 10 rebounds and Butler -- back after a two-game absence for personal reasons -- had 18 for Miami. The Heat fell to 23-4 at home and have dropped seven of their last nine overall. The Heat have had major trouble closing games of late -- a 22-point lead late in the third quarter against Cleveland on Monday was frittered away in what probably was the worst loss of the season, until now anyway -- and a long film session and meeting on Tuesday clearly didn't solve the issue. ""I just think this is our period of the season where there's some adversity,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It's a good thing when the thing we need to work on is what to do when we have double-digit leads. That shows we're capable of getting to that point. We just have to close out and finish."" The Heat stayed a half-game ahead of Philadelphia in the race for the No. 4 spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Philadelphia lost in Cleveland earlier Wednesday, a game where 76ers star Joel Embiid departed early because of a shoulder injury. Miami led 121-109 with 3:59 left, and 123-112 after a layup by Butler 24 seconds later. And Minnesota -- a team that came into the night with one win in a span of 48 days -- still wasn't finished off. The Timberwolves scored the next 11 points to tie the game, getting five of those points from Beasley and a tying free throw from McLaughlin with 46 seconds left. ""That's a great team, well-coached, numerous amount of weapons offensively and defensively with tactics,"" Russell said. ""So for us to come out on top with the win, mano-e-mano, was great."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota's 27 attempts from 3-point range in the first two quarters was a first-half franchise record. ... The Wolves are 4-0 in road games against Southeast Division teams this season, and 6-19 in all other road contests. Heat: Adebayo played through a sprained right ankle, pushing his consecutive-game streak to 144 -- extending the fourth-longest such streak in team history. ... Goran Dragic's first basket was a 3-pointer, and that pushed him one point past Grant Long (5,473) for 10th on the Heat career scoring list. ... Nunn got his third consecutive rookie of the month trophy in a brief halftime ceremony. JOHNSON RETURNS Wednesday marked James Johnson's first game back in Miami since the trade that sent him to Minnesota earlier this month, a move that sent Andre Iguodala, Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill to Miami from Memphis. ""Hell yeah, we played for him,"" Russell said. Johnson had 11 points in 23 minutes. LOOKING AHEAD A large contingent of fans from Slovenia were in attendance Wednesday -- and more are coming Friday, when the Heat play host to the Dallas Mavericks. At last season's Dallas-at-Miami game, more than 2,000 Slovenians were in attendance to watch their nation's two best NBA players, Dragic and Dallas star Luka Doncic, go head-to-head.","401161510"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Dallas Mavericks were not rattled when a disastrous start to the fourth quarter threatened to dismantle a game they thoroughly dominated to that point. Having Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis on offense tends to ease such tension. Doncic had 26 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds, and Porzingis added 28 points and 12 rebounds as Dallas powered past the San Antonio Spurs 109-103 on Wednesday night. Doncic had his 13th triple-double of the season, giving him 21 for his career to tie Jason Kidd for Dallas' franchise record. Donic, who turns 21 on Friday, shrugged when told of the record. He was happier the Mavericks overcame a rough start to the final quarter and snapped a four-game skid in San Antonio. ""It's tough to play here,"" Doncic said. ""You can see we're learning. It's not always going to be perfect, but we're learning."" Dallas is 13 games above .500 for the first time this season. DeMar DeRozan had 27 points, nine assists and eight rebounds to lead the Spurs, who lost for the seventh time in nine games after going 2-6 on their annual Rodeo Road Trip. The Mavericks scored only one point in the first six minutes of the final quarter, threatening their dubious league record of two points scored in a quarter in 1997. Trey Lyle's 3-pointer with 6:16 put the Spurs up 90-89, their first lead since the opening minute of the first quarter. Losing the lead roused Dallas, who outscored San Antonio 18-7 over the next four minutes to regain control. ""They picked up the heat on defense,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We didn't execute the way we had been earlier in the game, and they made a run. We had to respond, and we did."" Doncic and Porzingis combined for 11 points, five assists and two rebounds in the final six minutes of the fourth. San Antonio forward LaMarcus Aldridge sat out with a sore right shoulder, missing his bobblehead giveaway night. Marco Belinelli added 14 points and Lonnie Walker IV had 12 points while starting in place of Aldridge. The Mavericks, Porzingis and Doncic particularly, quickly took advantage of the Spurs' smaller lineup. ""It's just experience playing with each other and getting to know each other and little details about the game,"" Porzingis said of playing with Doncic. ""I feel like also me playing at the five now more I'm more involved with him in the pick and rolls and not standing around on the perimeter as much. I'm more involved rolling, popping (and) then I have the option to pick what I want to do and play off of Luka. We have a better rhythm now."" Porzingis and Doncic combined to score the Mavs' first nine points. Porzingis scored 16 points in the first quarter on 3-for-4 shooting, including a 27-footer that stunned the crowd. Dallas led 36-20 at the end of the period. The Spurs shot 29% in the first quarter and finished three points shy of their season low for scoring in the opening period. ""I think the game plan that I came out with was poor, and they took advantage of it in the first quarter,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said, ""And we turned it over nine times in the first half. So, that got us in a hole, but you know they're a hell of a team and I'm really proud of the effort and stick-to-itiveness"" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas' last victory in San Antonio was Jan. 29, 2017. ... Willie Cauley-Stein missed the game for personal reasons. ... Boban Marjanovic shared a long hug with Spurs assistant coach Tim Duncan before the start of the second half.

Lyles yelled and demonstratively demonstrated how he didn't make contact on a foul he was whistled for. ... San Antonio's season low for points in the first quarter is 17 against Miami on Jan. 15. WORKING ON WALKER After playing limited minutes to start the season, Walker made his fourth start. He started the game defending Doncic, who was limited to nine points in the first half. ""He's getting minutes and he's figuring things out,"" Popovich said of Walker. ""He's understanding more and more what it takes, be solid more than anything at both ends of the court. It takes time, but he's guarding a heck of a guy in Mr. Doncic tonight. All those are great lessons for him.""","401161511"
"The step-back 3-pointer from James Harden and Luka Doncic has the NBA on its' toes. (1:29) HOUSTON --  On a night when the Houston Rockets scored 140 points, all anyone wanted to talk about was their defense. Russell Westbrook and James Harden combined for 63 points as the Rockets sailed to their fifth straight win, 140-112 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. Harden piled up 30 points without playing in the fourth quarter and Westbrook, who had 33, sat down for good with about six minutes left. The duo had 46 points by halftime as Houston built a 73-47 lead. Although the Rockets let up a bit on defense with a huge lead after halftime, coach Mike D'Antoni raved about his team's effort before the break. It was just very good activity getting in lanes,"" D'Antoni said. Our defense, rebounding, boxing out, everything in that first half was just really good."" Added Harden: We're finally getting there defensively and that's what it's going to take for us to win games. ... If we want to get to where we want to go we have to engage and lock in on the defensive end, and we did that."" The Rockets pushed their advantage to 35 after scoring the first nine points of the third quarter. The Grizzlies then scored the next 13 points, capped by a 3-pointer from DeAnthony Melton, to cut it to 82-60 with about 7 minutes left in the period. DAntoni called a timeout and the Rockets got back on track after that, using a 10-3 spurt, with 3s from P.J. Tucker and Harden, to extend it to 92-63 midway through the quarter. On defense our communication is great, and offensively, we can't be guarded,"" Austin Rivers said. So I think we're the best offensive team in the league and when our defense is up to par, we become a hard team to beat."" A 9-0 run late in the third got the Grizzlies within 17, but the Rockets closed out the period with an 11-5 spurt, capped by a 3 from Rivers at the buzzer, to take a 111-88 lead into the fourth. Dillon Brooks had 22 points for the Grizzlies, who finished 0-4 on their longest road trip of the season. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins hopes his team can learn from this difficult time. We are ready to get home and continue to get back to work,"" he said. This is a great experience for our guys. It's a tough four-game stretch, but there's a lot of games to be played. Just keep our spirits up and keep getting better."" Westbrook also had nine rebounds and eight assists after missing Mondays game with a sore thumb. It was his second straight 30-point game and fourth in his last five. Harden hit seven 3-pointers on a night when the Rockets made 23 of 50 from long range. Houstons winning streak started in the game before the All-Star break, and the Rockets have scored 120 points or more in all four wins since then, beating Golden State, Utah and New York before Wednesday's rout.

"PHOENIX --  Reggie Jackson's 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter gave the Los Angeles Clippers a double-digit lead. Teammate Marcus Morris hit another 3 with 45 seconds left that helped fend off a final Phoenix rally and secure the win. The two newest Clippers had big moments in their team's 102-92 victory over the Suns on Wednesday night. As the games get more important heading into the final months, Clippers coach Doc Rivers says it won't be the last time they're needed. ""They're both going to win at least one playoff game each for us,"" Rivers said. ""You just know that. You know how the games are going to go. We're going to need a big shot here or there, and one or both of them will make one."" Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 24 points and 14 rebounds while Morris finished with 18. Jackson had 12 points off the bench and made 4 of 6 shots, including 2 of 4 from 3-point range. Los Angeles won its second straight game, bouncing back from a tough stretch that included its only three-game losing streak of the season. The Clippers are still working to piece together their upgraded playing rotation, which includes the recently acquired Morris and Jackson. Their newfound depth was on display in Phoenix. The Clippers used 10 players and all of them played at least 16 minutes. Leonard was the only one who had to play more than 30 minutes. ""We're just trying to be on the same page right now,"" Leonard said. ""It's only been two games that we've won, so it's nothing too huge. We've got to keep going."" The Clippers led by as many as 15 points during the third quarter before settling for a 76-66 advantage going into the fourth. The Suns never cut the deficit to less than seven in the final quarter. It was a disappointing start to a six-game homestand for Phoenix, which is among several teams fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West. Memphis is at No. 8 right now, but Portland, San Antonio, New Orleans, Sacramento and Phoenix are all within five games. Deandre Ayton led the Suns with 25 points and 17 rebounds. All-Star guard Devin Booker had a rough night, scoring 14 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Phoenix shot just 39% from the field and Leonard's defense on Booker was crucial. ""He's amazing with his reach, his hands, his foot movement,"" Rivers said. ""He's very smart and extremely strong. I thought that set the tone for us for sure."" Booker came into Wednesday averaging 26.3 points. ""I've been in this situation where you feel like you can't put a rock in the ocean and tonight I felt like they were good shots,"" Booker said. ""A lot of open shots, maybe too open, but that's part of the game. It's a make or miss league at the end of the day and if you're not making shots, it's tough to win."" Phoenix led for most of the first half, but the Clippers rallied for a 54-49 lead at the break. Leonard had 12 points for the Clippers, while Ayton led the Suns with 14.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Jayson Tatum took over the game when Boston needed his offense. Then his teammates finished the job in the fourth quarter. Tatum had 33 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Celtics over the skidding Utah Jazz 114-103 on Wednesday night. He matched Donovan Mitchell shot for shot during the second quarter after Mitchell sparked the Jazz offense. The two third-year players combined for 16 baskets and 38 points over that 12-minute stretch. ""It was fun to watch,"" Boston guard Marcus Smart said. ""It was fun to be a part of. It's always good when you have guys going as hard as those guys were going tonight."" For Tatum, it marked his third consecutive game with at least 30 points while shooting 60% or better from the field. Kevin McHale was the last player to accomplish that feat, in March 1987. Tatum went 13 of 20 from the floor overall and made three 3-pointers. His efforts helped the Celtics finish 3-1 on a road trip out West. ""This was big for our team,"" Tatum said. ""This is a tough place to play. It's a great way to end a road trip. We could have made excuses on a back-to-back, but we didn't."" Tatum's efficiency and explosiveness on offense rubbed off on his teammates. Jaylen Brown added 20 points and Smart had 17 for Boston. All five starters scored in double figures. Mitchell scored 37 points to lead Utah. Mike Conley chipped in with 15 and Royce O' Neale added 14 for the Jazz, who lost their fourth straight game -- all at home. After a back-and-forth third quarter, Boston created some separation early in the fourth. The Celtics broke an 82-all tie on a 3-pointer from Gordon Hayward in the final minute of the third. Smart then made three outside shots and Enes Kanter had three baskets in the paint to help Boston extend its lead to 100-87 with 7:22 left. ""We competed defensively,"" Mitchell said. ""I think we can hang our hats on that. But now it's about sustaining that for 48 minutes. I don't think we should be upset at our effort, just little mistakes that we can fix. They're a good team. They're going to capitalize if you make mistakes."" Utah missed 14 of its first 17 shots and scored only eight points over the game's first 10 minutes. The Jazz shot just 27% from the floor in the period. Boston was not much better at 36% from the field over the first 12 minutes, but the Celtics did enough to take a 19-8 lead after Smart tipped in his own missed shot. ""I thought we gave a really pure, good effort. I think you could feel it watching the game. We've got to make a few more shots,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I saw a team that was committed to defending and playing together."" The Jazz offense got rolling when Mitchell took over in the second quarter. He beat the first-quarter buzzer for his first basket and then ripped off 20 points on nine buckets over the final 12 minutes before halftime. With Mitchell leading the way, Utah made 10 of its first 12 shots in the period and erased a 10-point deficit. The Jazz put together a 17-3 run to take a 43-39 lead. Mitchell ignited the spurt with back-to-back baskets, hit the go-ahead jumper and finished it off with a fast-break floater. Tatum matched Mitchell's second-quarter outburst with one of his own. He scored 18 points on seven baskets to help Boston keep pace. His final bucket in the quarter, a driving layup, gave the Celtics a 53-51 halftime lead. ""Those two guys are really good, aren't they?"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""Sometimes, I think we overscrutinize the better players in this league. When you watch them do what those two were doing, not many people can do that."" LINEUP SHAKEUP Utah changed its starting lineup, inserting O'Neale in place of Joe Ingles. O'Neale matched his season high for points, scoring in double figures for the first time in a month. Snyder made the move with an eye toward improving the defense by starting O'Neale, one of the team's better perimeter defenders. The coach also made it clear he isn't finished tinkering with his rotations. ""Joe has not started. Royce has not started. Mike has not started,"" Snyder said. ""Those lineups and those decisions are always fluid."" PERFECT AT FIFTY The Celtics improved to 16-0 when shooting 50% or better from the field. Boston finished at 54% against the Jazz, including 11 of 26 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Celtics: Kemba Walker (left knee soreness) did not play. ... Smart had a team-high nine assists and three steals. ... Boston outscored Utah 56-46 in the paint. Jazz: Rudy Gobert got hit with a technical foul with 6:13 left in the third quarter after arguing a call that led to his fourth personal. The technical negated a coach's challenge by Snyder on the foul call. . Utah scored a season-low 15 points in the first quarter.","401161514"
"With Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons both sustaining untimely injuries, David Fizdale, Zach Lowe and Amin Elhassan voice their concern for the 76ers as the NBA playoffs approach. (2:00) PHILADELPHIA --  Tobias Harris performance had the 76ers feeling good during the game, and the doctors report on Joel Embiid afterward had them feeling even better. Harris scored 34 points to lead short-handed Philadelphia to a 115-106 victory over the New York Knicks on Thursday night. The 76ers played without injured All-Stars Embiid and Ben Simmons. Embiid was hurt in Wednesday nights loss at Cleveland when he collided with Ante Zizic. After Thursdays victory, the 76ers learned that their star center didnt have any structural damage. He has a sprained left shoulder and will be re-evaluated in about a week. Thats exciting news, 76ers coach Brett Brown said. Before the game, Brown discussed playing without Embiid and Simmons. Its a painfully obvious bind, Brown said. Were missing two All-Stars. You yank that from the team and its painful. The duos absence didnt hurt against the woeful Knicks. Shake Milton scored 19 points and Al Horford added 15 for the 76ers, who improved to their NBA-best home record to 28-2. Harris signed a five-year, $180 million deal in the offseason. He usually takes a back seat offensively to Embiid or Simmons, but Philadelphia needed him to be the go-to player against New York. Just taking the opportunities that were presented, said Harris, who added seven rebounds and seven assists. We had a good pop to our offense and I was able to get in-the-flow plays. Julius Randle had 30 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who lost their sixth straight game while clinching a sixth straight losing season. Bottom line, we have to do a better job (defensively), Knicks coach Mike Miller said. Tonight it was the second quarter. I like the way we played in the second half. The Knicks were within 107-102 with 2:08 left after Randle made the first of two free throws, but consecutive 3-pointers by Harris and Milton gave Philadelphia breathing room. Hes just a highly competitive person, Brown said of Harris. Thats why hes good. Very prideful. Harris had 23 points in the opening half to help Philadelphia to a 61-46 lead at the break. Milton went 4-for-4 from the field including three 3-pointers in the first half. Randle had 15 points at the intermission for the Knicks. New York got within four points on Moe Harkless 3 with 5:09 left in the third period. But Philadelphia had an 87-79 advantage to start the fourth. MISSING MEN Embiid sat for the 17th time this season due to injury or suspension. Simmons missed his third game. Injured in a practice, he has a nerve impingement in his lower back and will miss at least two weeks. The 76ers started Josh Richardson, Harris, Milton, Glenn Robinson III and Horford. SHAKES SHOTS Milton finished 5-for-5 from 3-point range. For me, its just about staying ready and putting in the work, he said.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Pacers are preparing for a playoff run with a starting five that's barely played together this season. Domantas Sabonis had 20 points and 11 rebounds to lead Indiana to a 106-100 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night. Malcolm Brogdon had 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds while T.J. Warren and Victor Oladipo scored 15 points each for the Pacers, who have won four of their last five. Oladipo was playing in his ninth game of the season. ""Tonight was about being consistent and really establishing ourselves, especially that first unit,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""That group has only played about 100 minutes together this season. That's about three games, so it was really about them working on an identity."" CJ McCollum had 28 points and eight assists, Gary Trent Jr. scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half and finished with five rebounds, and Hassan Whiteside had 18 points and 16 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who have lost five of six. The Pacers were able to hold off the Blazers' late push to snap a five-game losing streak in the series. Indiana led by as much as 14 when Warren made a fadeaway jumper to give the Pacers a 96-82 lead with 6:12 remaining. ""We started being aggressive,"" Sabonis said. ""We didn't have enough energy in the first half. We've got a lot of weapons and when we get stops, it's tough to guard us in transition."" Portland then went on an 18-7 run to cut the deficit. After Brogdon made a jumper to give Indiana a 103-93 lead with 1:54 remaining, the Trail Blazers scored seven straight. McCollum's floater made it 103-100 with 30 seconds to go. Myles Turner drilled a 3-pointer with 9 seconds remaining to seal it. ""It felt like it was a winnable game, that's for sure,"" McCollum said. ""We had a chance. Probably shouldn't have let them get that run, but we were able to withstand it and come back."" The Trail Blazers went on a 10-1 run late in the first half to push ahead. McCollum made a 3-pointer to give Portland a 42-40 lead with 3:13 to go in the second quarter. After a free throw by Oladipo, McCollum made another 3 and then a fadeaway to put the Trail Blazers in front 47-41. Portland led 49-43 at halftime. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Carmelo Anthony had 12 points and seven rebounds. ... McCollum was 3 of 12 from 3-point range. ... G Damian Lillard missed a fourth straight game with a right groin strain.

FINDING HIS WAY Oladipo was back in the lineup after missing the last two games with a sore lower back. He missed the first 47 games of the season while recovering from a right knee injury. ""He's still working his way back and I thought he had a better third quarter,"" McMillan said. ""I thought he had a couple attacks in transition, which is what we want to see. We want to advance and allow him to get to the basket. We had 15 fast break points in the third quarter, so we got to the tempo we wanted to play and Vic was a big part of that.""","401161516"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder continue to thrive in seemingly uncomfortable situations. Danilo Gallinari scored 24 points and the Thunder rallied from 19 points down in the third quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 112-108 on Thursday night. It was the 15th time this season that the Thunder have won after trailing heading into the fourth quarter -- by far, the most in the league. ""We've just been in this situation a lot and we know what to do,"" Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""I think I can speak for all five guys that are in the game (late) most of the time. We're confident and work hard and trust it."" Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points and Chris Paul added 17 for the Thunder, who have won five straight and 14 of 17. Harrison Barnes scored 21 points and Harry Giles added a season-high 19 for the Kings, who had won three in a row. De'Aaron Fox, the Kings' No. 2 scorer, sat out with lower abdominal muscle tightness. Sacramento led 61-50 at halftime. Giles scored 15 points and Buddy Hield scored 12 on 4-for-4 shooting from 3-point range. ""We got to a point there, if they made a shot, we were hanging our heads trying to figure out whose fault it was instead of playing with the right pace,"" Paul said. The Kings quickly increased their advantage in the third quarter. A deep 3-pointer by Nemanja Bjelica put Sacramento up 75-57. Sacramento's biggest lead was 78-59 before Oklahoma City rallied. The Thunder went on a 15-0 run and held the Kings scoreless for nearly six minutes. ""It's like we flipped a switch,"" Paul said. ""Fortunately, we could do it tonight, but we can't rely on that every night."" Sacramento's lead was down to 82-81 at the end of the period. The Thunder made 11 of 18 field goals and all eight of their free throws in the third quarter. ""We put them at the foul line,"" Hield said. ""They slowed the game down. When they get to the halfcourt, they're a really good halfcourt defensive team and it's hard to get offensive opportunities and the momentum shifted away."" The Thunder led 110-106 in the final minute and had possession when Hield stole the ball. He missed an open 3-pointer and the Thunder ended up gaining possession. Sacramento's Cory Joseph stole the ball and Barnes made a layup to cut Oklahoma City's lead to two with 9.9 seconds remaining, but Paul made two free throws with 9.5 seconds left to put the game away. TIP-INS Kings: Made all 10 of their free throws in the first half. ... Sacramento's Kent Bazemore and Oklahoma City's Hamidou Diallo were called for a double technical in the third quarter. ... Joseph had 11 assists and one turnover. Thunder: Had six players score in double figures. ... Outscored the Kings 21-14 at the free throw line. ... Guards Paul and Dennis Schroder each had seven assists. ... The Thunder had just nine turnovers. SLOWING HIELD Hield, who played at the nearby University of Oklahoma, finished with 15 points after his hot start. The 3-point shootout champion during All-Star weekend made 1 of 5 shots in the second half, all 3-pointers. ""Just tried to stay attached to him as much as possible,"" Paul said. ""Buddy likes to hunt 3's. He's one of them guys that he might have a wide open layup and he's trying to get to the 3-point line."" STAT LINES During Oklahoma City's five-game win streak, center Steven Adams is averaging 16.4 points and 11.6 rebounds per game while shooting 62.3% from the field. HE SAID IT Thunder coach Billy Donovan on how the Thunder closed the game: ""I thought from about the six-minute mark (in the third quarter) on to the end of the game, the guys really turned it up and made a lot of winning plays.""","401161517"
"SAN FRANCISCO --  With LeBron James sidelined, Anthony Davis knew he had to do a little more -- everybody had to do a little more to pick up the slack. Davis had 23 points and six rebounds in three quarters and the Los Angeles Lakers won their seventh straight game and NBA-record 18th in a row on the road against the Western Conference, beating the injury-plagued Golden State Warriors 116-86 on Thursday night without King James. It meant taking better care of the ball in the second half and bringing energy on both ends. ""LeBron, when he's out, it's taking away a lot of things that we do, so it's on all of us to make sure we kind of fill those voids, and I think we did that tonight,"" Davis said. Rajon Rondo started in place of James and contributed 12 points and six assists as Los Angeles turned it into a rout with a 40-17 third quarter. James sat out because of recurring soreness in his troublesome left groin. Davis shot 6 for 13, made 10 of 12 free throws and also had a pair of blocked shots and steals for the Lakers, whose 12 first-half turnovers allowed the Warriors to keep it close. Kyle Kuzma added 18 points off the bench. Rookie Eric Paschall scored 23 points off the bench for his 11th 20-point game and Jordan Poole had 16 in the Warriors' eighth straight loss both overall and at home in new Chase Center. Poole limped off with 5:44 remaining in the third after rolling his right ankle then later returned after getting it re-taped -- but it briefly left Golden State with eight available players, two of those on 10-day deals. Golden State guard Ky Bowman went down with 1:11 to play and was helped off. Golden State forward Draymond Green's return from a two-game absence with a bruise in his right pelvic area was a short one: He was ejected 5:45 before halftime on his second technical just 11 seconds after his first at 5:56. Golden State also missed Andrew Wiggins, a late scratch with spasms in his upper back. The Warriors hung tough early but couldn't stay with the Lakers as they did in Los Angeles' 125-120 win here Feb. 8. And if it couldn't get worse for the home team, beloved Lakers super-sub Alex Caruso drew late MVP chants as the arena quickly emptied. This losing streak is wearing on the Warriors. ""We need to win a game,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""We need to win a game once in a while to feel better about things. Right now we're in a bad stretch. It's tough."" JAMES UPDATE James had already been ruled out on Wednesday and coach Frank Vogel said postgame a decision on James' status would come Saturday morning ahead of a game at Memphis that night. ""Just dealing with some soreness. We're still two days away,"" Vogel said. James, who missed 27 games last season nursing the tender groin he hurt Christmas Day 2018 at Golden State, scored a season-high 40 points in Tuesday's home victory against Zion Williamson and the Pelicans. Kerr can look at James as an example of a superstar taking it up to a new level after a full offseason given the Lakers star had played in eight straight NBA Finals before last year. Golden State has reached five Finals in a row, but not this season -- so players such as Stephen Curry, Green and Klay Thompson may benefit from extended rest. ""Watching LeBron, he looks refreshed, he looks recharged. The idea of eight straight Finals in insane when you think about five here and what it's done and how our players have felt this past year and the injuries that have hit,"" Kerr said. ""I do believe that when all is said and done, by next year's training camp our guys should feel recharged and refreshed and ready to go. Hopefully that's the case. LeBron's also LeBron. He's built differently than most people."" TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers have won the initial three meetings with one left April 7 in L.A.

Los Angeles improved to 18-1 overall away from Staples Center vs. the West, having lost its ""road"" opener Oct. 22 vs. the Clippers at Staples Center. The Lakers won their fourth consecutive road game overall to improve to 24-5 on the season. Warriors: The Warriors used their 29th different starting lineup, their most in a season since a franchise-record 49 in 2009-10. ... Golden State plans an update Saturday on the status of Curry, who has long targeted Sunday's home game against the Wizards as his return date from a broken left hand -- and if he does play will have missed 56 games since getting hurt against the Suns on Oct. 30. ... The Warriors dropped to 7-23 at home and 5-16 against the West. ... Golden State had won 12 of the previous 14 home games vs. the Lakers. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Aaron Gordon recorded his first career-triple double and was proudest of his assist total. Terrence Ross scored 19 of his season-high 33 points in the fourth quarter and Gordon finished with 17 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists, leading the Orlando Magic to a 136-125 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. Gordon is averaging more than 21 points and 10 rebounds over the Magic's recent six-game surge. This time, he felt best about his career high in assists. ""That's what I'm looking to do,"" he said. ""I'm looking to distribute the ball and make the game easier for everybody on the floor and they do the same for me. It works well."" ""He puts us in a different place,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""He's not just scoring, he's playing an all-around game."" Nikola Vucevic added 27 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, who won for the fifth time in six games. D'Angelo Russell led Minnesota with 28 points, but did not score After a layup that gave the Timberwolves an 89-83 lead with 4:55 left in the third quarter. Juancho Hernangomez added 18 points and 13 rebounds. The Timberwolves have lost 19 of their last 21 games, and 11 of their last 12 in Orlando. The 136 points marked a season-high for the Magic, the second-lowest scoring team in the NBA. They shot 54% and had a 54-33 rebounding advantage. ""You can't get outrebounded by 21,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""To beat and compete with a team that has been together a long time, you've got to force yourself to be a little more disciplined than you may be. We just didn't have that tonight."" After falling behind by as many as 13 points in the first half, Minnesota rallied behind Russell and Malik Beasley, taking a six-point lead on a 3-pointer by Russell from the corner with 5:23 left in the third quarter. Orlando regained the lead on a 3-pointer by D.J. Augustin and finished the period strong, without any starters on the floor. Ross scored the Magic's first 10 points of the fourth quarter, connecting on two straight 3s to push Orlando's lead back to 10 with 9:31 remaining. A layup by Augustin gave the Magic their biggest lead, 117-103, with 8:08 left. TIP-INS Timberwolves: C Karl-Anthony Towns missed a fourth game with a left wrist injury. ...

When Okogie missed the third of his three foul shots, Jordan McLaughlin got the ball and hit a 3-pointer. WHAT ABOUT THE DEFENSE? Clifford wasn't too excited about the final score or Minnesota's 48% shooting and 17 3-point baskets. ""We've got to put more into the defensive end,"" he said. ""Right now, our defensive mentality isn't close to what it needs to be.""","401161519"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks have been the NBA's worst 3-point shooters this season, so rookie Cam Reddish was pleased to be a big part of a one-night reprieve. ""We've all been putting in a ton of work in practice, extra work on our jump shots and defense,"" Reddish said, ""but to see our shots go down today was a great feeling."" John Collins had 33 points and 13 rebounds, Reddish scored 17 of his career-high 26 points in the third quarter, and the Hawks handed the Brooklyn Nets their third straight loss with a 141-118 victory Friday night. Trae Young, ranking second in the NBA in scoring and assists, finished with 22 points and assisted on 14 baskets to help Atlanta, the league's second-worst team, snap a two-game skid. The Hawks hit 19 3-pointers and finished 48.7% on treys on rare night of fun beyond the arc. The Nets gave up a season high in points. They pulled within six on Caris LeVert's layup early in the fourth, but got no closer the rest of the way after Jeff Teague and Kevin Huerter answered with baskets that pushed the lead back to double digits. ""We are seventh in the league in defense and tonight we looked like were 800th in defense."" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We lost our defensive identity tonight. It's one game. I'm not going to change things and go crazy."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 24 points to lead Brooklyn, which began the game seventh in the Eastern Conference before dropping six games under .500. It had won eight straight over the Hawks and five consecutively in Atlanta. The game got away from the Nets in the third. Atkinson called timeout after Atlanta hit its 10th trey for a nine-point lead and immediately got a technical foul for arguing that Dinwiddie had been fouled on the previous possession. Dinwiddie and Harris missed shots in the next possessions, and the Hawks soon led by 14 on Reddish's 3. ""Tonight was a real example of all of our guys trending in the right direction,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""To put together that type of win was really encouraging to see."" TIP-INS Nets: The previous season high allowed was 138 points in a loss at Phoenix. ... Brooklyn got off to a hot start, ending the first with a 36-29 lead to tie a team season high in points in the opening period. ... LeVert, coming off a 34-point performance at Washington, had 18. He had an offensive rebound and putback to end the first, but was mostly quiet the rest of the way. Hawks: The young, rebuilding team has won 10 of its last 21 games. ... Young scored 39 and 47 in two games of the season series, but this time he was mostly about passing. One of his better moments was a no-look dish high in the lane to a streaking Jeff Teague for a fast-break layup that made it 88-78 in the third. ... Collins scored 20 in a half for the seventh time in his three-year career. ... Atlanta finished one 3 shy of tying a season high. SINKING The Nets were coming off two tough setbacks in the closing minutes, blowing a 19-point lead to lose at home to Orlando and rallying briefly after being down 18 at Washington but losing for the 12th time this season when taking a lead into the fourth. They couldn't stop Atlanta's shooters in the third. Reddish, a 30% 3-point shooter this season, was 6 for 9 in the game after hitting on consecutive possessions to make it 97-86 and followed with an 18-footer to make it a nine-point lead. Huerter and Collins followed with two straight 3s for a 14-point advantage. Brooklyn's defense was slipshod, and the Nets were out-rebounded 52-38, causing Dinwiddie to say he and his teammates ""made the game easy"" for Atlanta. ""One of our hallmarks even during our bad seasons was our scrappiness, our toughness and playing hard all the time even when we weren't winning games,"" he said. ""You want to have that type of mentality. You want to defend at a high level and that gives you a chance to win every game."" COMEBACK KID Reddish, the 10th overall draft pick, overcame a concussion earlier this month and has scored in double figures in seven straight games and 13 of his last 14. He played a game-high 34 minutes. ""I feel like he had it tonight, and when he has that confidence you can just see the talent oozing out of him,"" Collins said. ""Hopefully he keeps that confidence and playing that way because the game really opens up when you have a guy like him who can slice, cut, shoot and make plays like he did.""","401161520"

Toronto, which lost 108-97 to NBA-leading Milwaukee on Tuesday, dropped back-to-back games for the first time since losing at Indiana on Dec. 23 and at home to Boston on Christmas Day. ""We just didn't have the complete effort tonight,"" Lowry said. ""It hurts. You don't want to ever lose but you've got to grow from it, you've got to learn from it."" It's just the fourth time this season the defending champions have dropped consecutive games. Toronto lost three in a row between Dec. 3 and 8, losing at home to Miami and Houston before a defeat in Philadelphia. Raptors guard Fred VanVleet sat out because of a sore left shoulder, while forward Serge Ibaka was inactive because of a sore left knee. Powell returned to the starting lineup after missing nine games because of a broken finger on his left hand. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson started for Ibaka and fouled out with four points. Hollis-Jefferson missed six of eight field goal attempts but had nine rebounds. Down 73-66 through three quarters, Toronto took its first lead of the second half on Lowry's 3-pointer with 2:29 remaining. Lowry's big shot came after the Raptors grabbed the rebound on their All-Star guard's missed free throw. Rozier answered with a 3, and Graham made one of two at the line to push Charlotte's lead to 93-90. Lowry connected from deep again to tie it, then scored on a driving layup to give the Raptors a 95-93 lead with 1:14 remaining. Bridges hit a 3 for the Hornets, but Lowry tied it again by making the second of two free throws. After a missed shot by Graham, Toronto had two chances to break the tie, but Powell and Lowry both missed, giving the Hornets the ball with 2.1 seconds to play. Hollis-Jefferson fouled Rozier before the ball was inbounded, and the Hornets guard broke the tie by making one free throw. Charlotte kept the ball and Siakam fouled Graham, who made both to push the lead to 99-96 with 1.2 seconds left. Powell's attempted tying shot bounced off the rim at the buzzer. Down 25-23 after one, Toronto missed 13 of its first 15 field goal attempts in the second and shot a dismal 6 for 27 in the quarter. Charlotte led 52-41 at halftime.

"MIAMI --  Luka Doncic turned 21 on Friday, and the Miami Heat were determined not to give him and the Dallas Mavericks a gift-wrapped victory. So after wasting another lead, the Heat found a way to rally. Jimmy Butler scored 26 points, Duncan Robinson added 24 and the Heat scored the first 13 points of the fourth quarter to spark a 126-118 win over the Mavericks. ""Overall, we just needed to gut something out together, collectively against a really good team,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn each had 16 points for Miami. Bam Adebayo added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat, who won for just the third time in their last 10 games. ""We stayed together through their runs,"" Butler said. Seth Curry had a career-high 37 points for Dallas, shooting 13 for 15 from the field and 8 for 9 from 3-point range. Kristaps Porzingis scored 24 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, and Doncic -- playing with an aching thumb -- shook off a 2-for-9 start from the floor to finish with 23 points and 10 assists. ""I couldn't catch the ball,"" Doncic said. ""I didn't know how important the thumb was to hold the ball. It was tough. ... I wasn't myself today. Just have to learn from that and move on."" Kelly Olynyk finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and nine assists for the Heat, with six of those assists coming in a five-minute span of the final quarter when Miami -- which wasted a lead in the third -- rallied. With former Slovenian national teammates Doncic and Dragic going head-to-head, the Heat -- as they did when Dallas visited last season -- deemed it Slovenian Heritage Night, and there were hundreds of flag-waving fans from the European nation in the crowd. Some even wore specially designed T-shirts with Doncic and Dragic on the front, and the Slovenian flag on the back. So the mood was festive, and even the non-Slovenian Heat fans liked how things looked when Miami took a 12-point lead in the third quarter. And then yet another lead slipped away -- or, in Slovenian, ""se eno vodilo je zdrsnilo."" For the fourth time in the last five games, the Heat saw a double-digit lead vanish. The Mavs needed only a stretch of 2:29 in the third to turn an 83-74 deficit into an 88-85 lead -- a 14-2 spurt that was started by a 3-pointer from Curry and ended with another Curry 3. ""Seth was great,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""His shooting of the basketball has been phenomenal for a stretch here. That's definitely a positive."" Dallas' lead was 93-88 going into the fourth, before the 13-0 Heat run to open the final quarter put Miami back on top for good. TIP-INS Mavericks: Jalen Brunson (right shoulder sprain) is rehabbing and has told the team that he is feeling improvement, but there is no timetable for any possible return. ... JJ Barea, who went to high school in Miami and was a big part of the Mavs' win over the Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals, played on the Heat home floor for the first time since Dec. 22, 2017. Heat: Butler's first basket of the third quarter pushed him to 1,000 points this season. He's the 31st player to have a 1,000-point season in Heat history, and Adebayo is on pace to be the 32nd in the next few games. ... Heat legend Tim Hardaway, one of five players in team history with a retired jersey number, was in attendance to watch his son -- the Mavs' standout wing Tim Hardaway Jr., who had 15 for Dallas. TURNING 21 Amid the celebrating of Doncic's 21st birthday Carlisle was asked pregame if he recalled what he was doing when he hit that age on Oct. 27, 1980, when he was preparing for his sophomore season at Maine: ""I don't exactly remember, but I wasn't going for my 22nd triple-double in a year and a half or whatever,"" Carlisle said. RECORD CHASING Robinson extended his streak of games with at least one 3-pointer to 44, five away from Rafer Alston's team record. Alston's streak was most unusual: It spanned the final 48 games of the 2003-04 season, then restarted on Jan. 8, 2010 -- the first game after he was re-acquired by the Heat as a free agent.","401161522"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  DeAaron Fox didnt decide until shortly before game time that he would play against the Memphis Grizzlies. His appearance moved the Sacramento Kings closer to the playoffs. Fox, who sat out Thursdays loss at Oklahoma City with lower right abdominal tightness, scored 25 points, including 16 after halftime, and the Kings beat Memphis 104-101 on Friday night. Harry Giles III added 16 for the Kings, who moved within three games of Memphis, handing the Grizzlies their fifth straight loss. Meanwhile, New Orleans, which beat Cleveland on Friday night, is within two games of Memphis for eighth place in the West. I felt fine, said Fox, who also is dealing with a shoulder injury. When you are in the thick of things, you are not really thinking about it. But coach Luke Walton wasnt sure he would see his second-leading scorer at 19.9 points a game. Walton saw Fox Thursday, and he wasnt moving so good. Walton focused his game plan on Fox not playing. Only after the guard tested the injuries in pregame warm-ups did he decide to give it a go. Its important for us right now, Walton said of Fridays win. They are all important, but this one, to kind of finish off a good road trip, he showed a lot of leadership, and then went out and played at a high level. The victory, the Kings fourth in five games since the All-Star break, came despite a season-high 32 points from Memphis forward Dillon Brooks along with 13 points and a career-high 25 rebounds for Jonas Valanciunas. Ja Morant had 20 points and 11 assists for Memphis, which has struggled since the break with the loss of starter Jaren Jackson Jr. and key reserve Brandon Clarke to injuries. I feel like it is good pressure, Brooks said of the losing streak in the midst of the playoff hunt. We were playing well, but weve hit a big adversity like this. Were hitting it now, and were being tested. The Kings led by as many as 10 early in the fourth quarter. And despite a furious Memphis rally down the stretch, Sacramento held on for its fourth win in the last five since the All-Star break. Memphis trailed by nine  100-91 -- on a 3-pointer from Fox with 2:47 remaining. Memphis would craft a 10-2 run capped by a three-point play from Morant with 10.2 seconds left and a 102-101 Sacramento lead. Buddy Hield, who had 14 points, converted a pair of free throws with 4.4 left and a 3-point attempt from Memphis guard Tyus Jones as time ran out bounced off the rim. The guys are finding a way. Unfortunately, it didnt lead to a win, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. TIP-INS Kings: Wrapped up a four-game trip. ... Kent Bazemore would finish with 13 points.  Nemanja Bjelica also had 13 points and 11 rebounds. Committed only nine turnovers, the fifth time Sacramento has recorded single digits in that category. Fox has reached at least 20 points in each of the last four games hes played. Grizzlies: Signed F Jarrod Uthoff to a 10-day contract on Thursday. Uthoff was with the Memphis Hustle of the G League. He did not play Friday.  Brooks previous high this season was 31 twice, the last time on Jan. 20 against the Pelicans.  Valanciunas previous career high in rebounds was 24 against Orlando last season. FOXS SHOULDER In addition to the abdomen problem, Fox also is dealing with a bum right shoulder. With that one, its on my shooting arm. Its something that you move around a lot and get hit with a lot of screens. Its something that I feel most of the game, but I think I played pretty well, so its alright. TIE-BREAKER The Kings won the season series 3-1 over Memphis, so Sacramento would hold that tie-breaker if the teams were deadlocked for the final playoff spot. All four games in the series were decided by five points or less.","401161523"
