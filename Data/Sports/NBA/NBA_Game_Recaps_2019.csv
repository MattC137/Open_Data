"Joel Embiid knows the 76ers didn't play well and says it was particularly hard losing on a national stage, but he has hope for the future. (1:08) BOSTON --  The Celtics will need time to figure out how to get the most out of their loaded roster this season. It didn't stop them from picking up their first victory on a night they celebrated the official return of their two biggest stars. Jayson Tatum had 23 points and nine rebounds, and the Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 105-87 on Tuesday night in the season opener for both teams. Boston won despite shooting just 43 percent (42 of 97) from the field and 30 percent from the 3-point line (11 of 37). But the Celtics' struggles didn't dampen the mood inside TD Garden for the return to regular-season action for Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Hayward said it was ""amazing"" to be back out there. ""My adrenaline was pumping those first three or four minutes,"" Hayward said. ""I think everybody's adrenaline was pumping. It was sloppy at first. It was great just to be out there. It was a big step for me."" Marcus Morris added 16 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Al Horford had nine points and five blocks. The Celtics survived a lethargic start and rough shooting night but rallied to lead by as many as 18 in the second half. Including the playoffs, Boston has won 10 straight games at home over Philadelphia, which it defeated in the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. Joel Embiid led the 76ers with 23 points and 10 rebounds. Ben Simmons finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. Embiid made it clear afterward the 76ers have a way to go to be on the Celtics' level. ""This not a rivalry,"" he said. ""I don't know our record against them. But it's pretty bad. They always kick our ass. So this is not a rivalry."" Hayward played in his first game since undergoing surgery and more than 10 months of rehabilitation for the gruesome left ankle injury he suffered five minutes into last year's season opener. He received an extended ovation from the home crowd during a pregame introduction that included a video montage of his rehab process. Irving was also back following a pair of surgeries on his left knee that caused him to miss the end of the regular season and playoffs. After receiving loud ovations during pregame introductions, Irving and Hayward both had sluggish starts. Hayward missed his first four shots before making back-to-back jumpers. Irving missed his first nine attempts from the field. He didn't score until finally connecting on a pair of free throws early in the third quarter. They shot a combined 6 for 26 for the game. Hayward finished with 10 points and five rebounds in 25 minutes. Irving had seven points and seven assists. The Celtics missed seven of their first 10 shots and the Sixers started just 4 for 11. The Sixers also committed 11 first-half turnovers that led to 10 Celtics' points. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he isn't worried. ""If we can guard like that, we've got a chance to be decent,"" he said. TIP-INS 76ers: Outscored the Celtics 50-34 in the paint. ... Jerryd Bayless (left knee), Wilson Chandler (strained left hamstring), and Mike Muscala (sprained left ankle) all sat out. Celtics: Have won 15 of last 17 regular-season meetings with 76ers. ...  Outrebounded the 76ers 55-47. TURNING POINT Boston got some distance in the second half thanks largely to its bench, which outscored its Philadelphia counterparts 44-26. The Celtics opened the second half on a 14-5 run, hitting five of their first seven shots. ""We're all just unselfish,"" said Terry Rozier, who finished with 11 points and eight rebounds. ""The depth, that's the most special part about this team."" FULTZ STARTS One of the biggest changes for Philadelphia entering the new season is the insertion of second-year guard Markelle Fultz into the starting lineup. The No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, he missed 68 games with a shoulder injury and was plagued by shooting issues and confidence problems. Fultz finished with five points, three rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes.","401070213"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry is coming off an injury-plagued season and a summer he thought might be among his best yet. On a festive night of celebration as another championship banner went up, Curry brought his usual flair and dazzle. Kevin Durant did all of the little things, too. Curry had 32 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, Durant added 27 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and the Golden State Warriors opened their quest for a three-peat by holding off the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-100 on Tuesday night. ""I love who we are, game 1 of 82,"" Durant said. ""Just keep grinding."" Golden State needed a strong fourth quarter after the two-time defending champions received their 2018 rings in a pregame ceremony shortly before tipoff and began the final season at Oracle Arena before a move across San Francisco Bay to new Chase Center . ""It's a great move for the organization. We know that but this place is special, so we want to make sure this is a special season,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Klay Thompson shot just 5 of 20 for 14 points while center Damian Jones scored 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting for the Warriors in his first career start and 26th game. Kerr knows his players are still getting in shape and looked tired, saying: ""We didn't look much like ourselves. It's not surprising either. We need a couple more weeks."" Curry called it ""an emotional night"" but then the Warriors had to refocus and get to work. ""We played a solid game, nothing spectacular, we had a lot of mistakes,"" Curry said. ""We understand the process of kind of building up."" Paul George scored 27 points for the Thunder, who struggled to find an offensive groove while missing star Russell Westbrook because of knee surgery last month. Oklahoma City trailed by 10 at the break then came out of halftime making 9 of 12 shots to go ahead 69-66 before the Warriors rallied. ""I was really encouraged and pleased with the way we came out in the third quarter,"" coach Billy Donovan said. ""Last year at times it was a struggle for us."" Versatile Warriors All-Star Draymond Green, limited during the preseason by a sore knee, wound up with two points, 13 rebounds and five assists in nearly 33 minutes. Curry, who shot 11 for 20 with five 3s, notched 17 30-point performances during his injury-shortened 2017-18 season. These teams met in a season opener for the first time -- though the Warriors won on the road against the Seattle SuperSonics in 1983. Golden State lost last year's opener at Oracle after a title run, 122-121 to the Rockets. TIP-INS Thunder: OKC started 1 for 9, missing its initial three 3-point tries, and went 6 of 23 in the opening period (1 for 9 on 3s). ... The Thunder were outrebounded 57-46 but grabbed 16 on the offensive glass. ... C Steven Adams started after he had been questionable with lower back stiffness. Warriors: Andre Iguodala experienced left calf tightness and played 10 minutes, all in the first half. ... Reserve G Shaun Livingston, who had been questionable with right foot soreness, played 14 minutes. MOMENT OF SILENCE The Warriors showed a photo of late Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen on the big screen wearing a Portland hat, offering a tribute and moment of silence. Allen, a Microsoft co-founder who also owned the Seattle Seahawks, died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to his company Vulcan Inc. He was 65. ROCK THE VOTE Kerr encouraged fans to register to vote in a (hash)RockTheVote message on the scoreboard, while the Warriors also did so on social media with Twitter and Facebook posts. THE RINGS Players' rings -- what the team said are the first reversible championship rings ever -- were lowered from the rafters with blue and yellow lightsabers. Kerr called them ""obscenely beautiful"" and noted he much prefers the banner raising for its significance. At the end of the ceremony, Curry took the microphone and called out longtime equipment manager and director of team operations Eric Housen to receive his ring in a lovely gesture to someone so important to the operation behind the scenes. Recently retired big man David West, part of the last two title teams, sat courtside and received his ring. Representatives from each of the franchise's championship seasons were on hand for the festivities.","401070214"
"HOUSTON --  Anthony Davis couldn't help but notice James Harden's freshly minted MVP trophy sitting at midcourt before a ceremony during warmups on Wednesday night. After Harden hoisted the trophy for the first time before the Toyota Center home crowd and received a few MVP chants throughout the night, Davis began to make an MVP case of his own. Davis had 32 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high eight assists while Nikola Mirotic scored 30 points to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 131-112 win over the Houston Rockets in their season opener. ""When it was sitting there before the game, I glanced at it, and then I had to lock back in for the game,"" Davis said. ""That stuff will take care of itself. As long as we keep doing what we're doing as a team, the rest will come on its own."" Davis added three blocks and three steals, while Mirotic shot a sizzling 6 of 8 from 3-point range, and Julius Randle had 25 points off the bench. ""We moved the basketball and we made shots, but we put our hats on and defended,"" Davis said. ""To come out with a win against a team like that after the season they had and coming off the season we had, we wanted to come out and set a tempo for ourselves."" Eric Gordon led the Rockets with 21 points off the bench, while P.J. Tucker and Chris Paul both added 19 points. James Harden had 18 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. ""A little bit of legs and non-communication and giving them easy points, easy opportunities -- a little bit of everything,"" Harden said. ""But first game, you just continue to build those good habits and continue to get better every single game. We'll be all right."" The Pelicans dominated the first half, taking an early lead and never relinquished it as they hammered the undersized Rockets in the paint. New Orleans led 71-54 at the break and led by 29 points in the second half. The Pelicans outrebounded the Rockets 54-37. ""It was a good win for us, but to be honest, we feel like if we play at the level we're supposed to -- we're not surprised,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We played exactly how we have to in order to beat that team."" New Orleans dominated Houston in paint scoring, 76-44, and also shot 40 percent on 10 of 25 shooting from 3, compared with a rusty 33.3 percent (16 of 48) from the Rockets. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni didn't seem overly alarmed by the defensive display, praising New Orleans' energy. ""They played harder, longer and did a better job,"" D'Antoni said. ""They played great, but at the same time, there was a period in there where we got really tired and then trying to figure things out, being tired doesn't work, and we didn't have the energy and we kind of let go of the rope at the end of the first half. We obviously have some things to work on, we've got to get our legs and then go after it."" Coming off the bench for Houston with seven minutes remaining in the first quarter, Rockets offseason pickup Carmelo Anthony received a standing ovation when he entered the game wearing his trademark headband and the No. 7. Anthony made his first two shot attempts, the first, from 3, and finished 3-of-10 shooting for nine points in 27 minutes. TIP-INS Pelicans: C Jahlil Okafor (right ankle sprain) entered the game late in the fourth quarter, playing less than two minutes. Rockets: PG Michael Carter-Williams (left knee soreness) played on a minutes restriction as a precaution, with D'Antoni setting the cap around 15 minutes. Carter-Williams played 16 minutes and had 10 points. ... Centers Nene (right calf tightness) and Zhou Qi (left knee sprain) did not play. MOMENT OF SILENCE Before the game, the Rockets honored the life of late Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen on the big screen wearing a Portland hat, offering a tribute and moment of silence. Allen, a Microsoft co-founder who also owned the Seattle Seahawks, died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to his company Vulcan Inc. He was 65. A PERFECT 10 Elfrid Payton's minimalist triple-double made him the first player to record exactly 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a single game since March 2, 2013 when Kyle Lowry did it for Toronto. It was Payton's 11th career triple-double. HE SAID IT ""For all you analytics guys, we're not winning 82 (games) this year. That's done, that's all about how it's been proven."" -- D'Antoni.","401070215"
"PHOENIX --  Much of the talk going into the Dallas-Phoenix season opener centered on rookies Deandre Ayton and Luka Doncic. But it was Devin Booker's show, providing impressive evidence why the Suns thought him worth that five-year, $158 million deal. Booker scored 19 of his 35 points in the final 6:44 and lifted the Phoenix Suns to a 121-100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in the teams' season opener on Wednesday night. ""I'm not surprised. Suns fans are not surprised,"" Phoenix first-year coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""That's who he is."" The 21-year-old guard, who missed the entire preseason after undergoing a surgical procedure on his right (shooting) hand, sank four 3s, converted a three-point play, made a driving layup and hit two free throws after Dallas had cut what had been a 16-point lead to four. ""Just caught a rhythm,"" Booker said. ""It was that time of the game. We let them back in when we should have put them away, so I felt it was my job to make the plays to win the game."" Ayton got the best of Doncic on this night, but there will be many more to follow. Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, made 8 of 11 shots for 18 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and had six assists. Doncic, the No. 3 overall pick, struggled from the field, making 5 of 16 shots -- 0 of 5 3-pointers -- for 10 points. He had four assists and eight rebounds. ""I had a lot of fun,"" Ayton said. ""This is the most fun I've ever had playing basketball. Being at the top-top level, I wouldn't say I had one bad thing to say about this game."" Doncic said he ""was really happy that I could make my dream come true, but it wasn't the best game."" Trevor Ariza added 21 points, Josh Jackson 18 and T.J. Warren 17 for the Suns, who gave Kokoskov a victory in his NBA head coaching debut. Kokoskov had Booker playing point guard down the stretch. ""You're trying to land the plane with your best unit,"" Kokoskov said. The Mavericks, already without Dirk Nowitzki and Harrison Barnes, lost Devin Harris to a strained left hamstring in the first quarter and never led after the game's opening minute. Dwight Powell led six Dallas players in double figures with 16 points. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said the team's defense was the problem, particularly in the first and fourth quarters. ""Forty-six points (allowed) in the second and third quarters is pretty decent,"" he said. ""... but 75 combined in the first and fourth is disastrous."" Ayton made his first shot, was fouled by Doncic, and the three-point play put Phoenix ahead 3-2. The Suns led the rest of the night. Phoenix twice stretched the lead to 16 in the third quarter and was up 83-73 entering the fourth. But consecutive 3s by Dallas' Wesley Matthews and Jalen Brunson cut the Suns' lead to 94-90 with seven minutes to play. Booker followed with a driving layup, added a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired and converted a three-point play to put Phoenix up 102-94 with 4:34 to go. The Suns made 19 of 34 3s, seven of nine in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki, entering his 21st NBA season, is out indefinitely recovering from left ankle surgery. ... Barnes missed the opener with a right hamstring strain. ... Doncic was part of the Slovenia national team coached by Kokoskov that won the EuroBasket gold medal in 2017. ... Dallas was 10 of 33 on 3-pointers. Suns: G Jamal Crawford, whose signing was announced earlier in the day, was not in uniform. ... Phoenix has won six straight against Dallas, sweeping the three games last season, when the Suns won a league-worst 21. ... Isaiah Canaan, coming back from a gruesome leg injury sustained on the same court last season, got the start at point guard. ... Canaan was one of nine players to start at point guard for Phoenix last season.","401070216"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Markelle Fultz heard 20,000 Philadelphia 76ers fans exhort him to shoot each time he touched the ball, a roaring confidence boost for a No. 1 pick closer to a bust than brilliance. Fultz had the look he wanted in the second quarter. He dribbled to the foul line without a defender in his path, pulled up and uncorked a jumper. The ball rattled around the rim before it fluttered through the net. Sixers fans rose to their feet, erupted in cheers and chanted ""Fultz! Fultz! Fultz!"" Yes, a simple jumpshot from the top pick of the 2017 draft in the second game of the season was enough to get a rise out of the fans -- and a sigh of relief from Fultz. ""It makes me feel better for the whole crowd to feel as good as I want to,"" Fultz said. The curious case of Fultz's missing jumper continued against the Bulls when one of the more scrutinized players in the NBA managed to steal the spotlight from his more accomplished teammates with routine -- yet highlight-reel worthy -- baskets. Until he gets his shot right, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid will continue to lead the Sixers. Simmons had a triple-double with 13 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists and Embiid had 30 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers past the Chicago Bulls 127-108 on Thursday night. Fultz scored 12 points on 5 of 15 shooting, the most shots taken by a Sixer. ""He shot it to mean it,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""He didn't look afraid of anything. He missed the shots but they looked good."" Fultz is coming off a miserable rookie season that was shortened because of a right shoulder injury, a broken shot and busted confidence. Even his personal shooting coach said Fultz suffered from the ""yips,"" an assertion shot down on media day by the second-year guard. Fultz simply blamed his lost season on the injury. Brown tried to give Fultz a confidence boost by putting him in the starting lineup -- yet has benched him for the start of the second half. Fultz was 1 of 6 in 15 minutes in the first half and didn't play again until late in the third and the Sixers leading by 88-68. ""The challenge is to grow him and help us win the game,"" Brown said. ""There's no book that tells you how to do that, so you're going to have to figure some stuff out. There will be some pain along the way and some positives."" With or without Fultz, the 76ers had plenty of positives after an opening-night disaster in Boston. Simmons reached a triple-double with 2:34 left in the third, the 13th of his career and the first Sixer to ever get one in the home opener. Sixers fans chanted ""Trust the Process!"" when Embiid ended the third with free throws. Fultz proved a long-range ace again in the fourth -- this time with a 3! He drained his first career 3-pointer for a 108-88 lead and the Philly fans that are firmly perched in his corner went wild and again chanted his name. The Sixers know that if they want to become legitimate Eastern Conference contenders, Fultz will have to become the star they envisioned when they drafted him. ""I'm never afraid,"" Fultz said. ""I worked hard this summer. Tonight, I didn't make a lot of them, but I'm going to keep shooting them. If I see an open shot, I'm going to go shoot it."" He didn't even mind when Chicago's defense sagged off him, daring him to take shots. The Bulls, not expected to win much in the East, scored a combined 35 points in the second and third quarters. Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 30 points in their season opener. ""When we started missing shots, we stopped guarding and rebounding,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. TIP-INS Bulls: G Kris Dunn missed the game for the birth of his son. ... Bobby Portis had 20 points and 11 rebounds. 76ers: Rapper Meek Mill sat courtside and rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell to start the game. ... Embiid thanked the fans for coming and told them to ""Trust the Process."" 1ST Q &amp; NO D Embiid scored 12 points in the first 5 minutes of the game and neither team missed many looks in the first quarter. The Sixers made 11 of their first 14 shots and the Bulls started 14 of 19. The 76ers shot a whopping 70 percent in the quarter and still trailed the Bulls 41-38.","401070217"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  LeBron James' debut for the Los Angeles Lakers opened with two thunderous dunks and closed with a loss. He finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds, but the Portland Trail Blazers prevailed 128-119 Thursday night in the season opener for both teams. James insisted the new-look Lakers were going to be a work in progress. ""It's not instant oatmeal. It's not that fast,"" James said. ""It takes some time to get that chemistry where you can just close your eyes and know exactly where guys are."" Damian Lillard had 28 points and Nik Stauskas came off the bench to score 24 for Portland, which won its 18th straight home opener to extend an NBA record. It was the Blazers' 16th straight victory over the Lakers. The opening festivities were tempered by the death this week of Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen. A ""Rip City"" baseball cap rested in Allen's courtside seat with a single rose. The enigmatic co-founder of Microsoft died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was 65. There was moment of silence before the game and tributes to Allen throughout the night. On the court, the focus was all on James. His monster dunks to start stunned the Moda Center crowd while Nike co-founder Phil Knight looked on from courtside seats. James signed a four-year, $153 million deal with the Lakers as a free agent in the offseason after winning three NBA championship rings and taking his team -- Miami and Cleveland -- to the NBA Finals for each of the last eight seasons. The four-time league MVP joined a revamped group that includes veterans Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley, as well as a young core of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart and rookie Moe Wagner. While the Lakers made big changes in the offseason, the Trail Blazers returned all five starters from a team that finished third in the Western Conference last season -- including the nucleus of Lillard, CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic. ""We wanted to come out and start the season right and to honor our owner, Mr. Paul Allen. That's what tonight was all about for us, not about the noise surrounding the game,"" Lillard said. James' putback gave Los Angeles a 25-15 lead. He played just under nine minutes in the opening quarter and led all scorers with 13 points. Portland pulled in front 46-40 on Stauskas' 3-pointer. Stauskas, who signed with the Blazers as a free agent this past summer, led all Blazers with 16 points in the opening half. Portland pushed the lead to 11 but led just 65-63 at the break. ""He really got in a groove and the guy can shoot, we've seen it in practice,"" coach Terry Stotts said about Stauskas. ""I was really happy for him to start the season like that with a new team. The shots that he made were all in the flow of the offense."" James had 18 points but collected a third foul with 6:04 left in the half. Kuzma's dunk got the Lakers within 79-78 with just more than four minutes left in the third quarter. Hart's 3-pointer -- the Lakers' first of the game -- put Los Angeles up 85-83. The lead was short-lived, but Portland had just a 93-91 advantage going into the final quarter. Stauskas hit a 3-pointer that put Portland up 107-100 with 7:22 left. After it fell, he turned to the crowd and pounded his chest. McCollum's 3-pointer with 5:01 left put Portland up 114-104. Caldwell-Pope's 3-pointer with 30.7 seconds left got the Lakers within 124-118, but Stauskas made a pair of free throws and Los Angeles couldn't catch up. TIP INS Lakers: Lakers coach Luke Walton said Ball would continue to be on a playing-time restriction after having an offseason procedure on his knee. Ball played 20 minutes and scored seven points. ... Hart had 20 points off the bench. ... Los Angeles made 7 of 30 3-point attempts. Trail Blazers: With Maurice Harkless dealing with a knee injury that bothered him in the preseason, Stotts started Jake Layman. ... McCollum finished with 21 points. HONORING ALLEN On the edge of the Blazers court was painted PGA with a Rose, and the Blazers had similar patches on their jerseys to honor Allen. Stotts talked before the game about all the people Allen had touched. ""Everybody talks about his philanthropy throughout the years, and what he's done. When people started writing about it, and listing all the things and all his accomplishments and the impact on millions and millions of people, and the environment, the earth and everything -- it's hard to put into context, the magnitude,"" the coach said. ALL EYES ON US With James joining the team, the Lakers are certainly dealing with greater scrutiny with a huge media contingent on hand for his debut. ""We've talk about it, not to let it be a distraction. We're not going to let it influence what we're trying to do on this team,"" Walton said. ""In fact, we're trying to use it as something to grow a bond in our group. Our theme is to truly believe in the idea that it's just us, just us that are in here working, just us that are getting better.""","401070218"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard isn't quite back up to speed after missing most of last season. That's just fine with the Toronto Raptors. They are plenty happy with the way Leonard is playing right now. Leonard had 31 points and 10 rebounds, Serge Ibaka added 21 points and the Raptors beat the Boston Celtics 113-101 on Friday night in an early matchup of Eastern Conference contenders. Leonard, who was limited to nine games last season with San Antonio mostly because of a quadriceps injury, posted his second straight double-double and played 36 minutes, one fewer than he had Wednesday night a season-opening win over Cleveland. ""I'm not looking to get back to where I was before,"" Leonard said. ""I'm worried about the now and the player I'm trying to become now and tomorrow."" Leonard made 10 of 25 attempts, including 2 of 5 from 3-point range, and went 9 for 9 at the free throw line. ""No matter who Kawhi was against, Kawhi was doing well,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Leonard scored 15 of his points in an explosive third quarter, making 5 of 7 from the floor and 5 of 5 at the free throw line. ""Tonight he played extremely hard,"" Kyle Lowry said. ""He really was aggressive. That's the kind of thing we're gonna need for the whole season."" Lowry scored 15 points, Danny Green had 14, and Fred VanVleet 11 to help the Raptors win for the 11th time in 12 home meetings with the Celtics, including the past seven in a row. ""That's a good home win right there,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Kyrie Irving scored 21 points for Boston, and Al Horford had 14 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. ""Tonight was a great test for us,"" Irving said. ""We just came up short."" Jayson Tatum scored 16 points and Jaylen Brown had 13 for the Celtics. ""I thought they played a lot better than us in the second half,"" Stevens said."" We had our moments offensively but all the rebounds they got, especially late, really hurt us."" Boston's Gordon Hayward scored 14 points in 24 minutes, connecting on six of 13 field goal attempts. ""I felt like I found a little bit of rhythm there in the second half,"" Hayward said. ""It was a good start for me. Each game will be progress."" Still, it wasn't all good for Hayward, who suffered a gruesome left ankle injury five minutes into last year's season opener and didn't return. ""There's times where it still feels like I'm not playing like myself, I'm thinking too much out there,"" Hayward said. ""I felt like I was doing that in the first half a little bit."" Brown made a 3-pointer to give the Celtics an 87-86 lead with 9:03 remaining. VanVleet answered with a reverse layup, the first basket in a 6-0 spurt that gave Toronto the lead for good. ""They executed much better than we did,"" Horford said. ""We didn't take care of the ball as well as we could have down the stretch."" Green and Lowry each made 3-pointers around an offensive foul by Tatum with just over two minutes remaining, giving the Raptors a 107-99 edge. Green went 4 for 7 from long range, while Lowry made 3 of 5. MR. OCTOBER Serenaded by `MVP' chants from the sellout crowd of 19,800, Leonard said he appreciated the sentiment, if not the timing. ""It's a little too early,"" he said. ""I appreciate the support. I know they're excited about us winning the game tonight."" GIVING PAUSE Irving wrapped up his postgame scrum by apologizing to reporters for saying `um' so often in his replies. TIP INS Celtics: Horford took and made the only free throw by a Boston starter through the first three quarters. The Celtics finished 7 for 10 at the line while the Raptors were 14 for 19. ... Irving shot 10 for 20 from the field. ... Tatum had nine rebounds Raptors: G Delon Wright (left thigh) missed his second straight game. ... F OG Anunoby started the game wearing protective goggles but took them off after the first. Anunoby left Wednesday's win over Cleveland because of a right orbital contusion. ... Toronto made one change to its starting lineup, with Ibaka replacing Jonas Valanciunas. ... VanVleet led the Raptors with seven assists.","401070219"
"Jonas Jerebko tips in Kevin Durant's missed shot in the final seconds to secure a 124-123 win over the Jazz. (1:02) SALT LAKE CITY --  Jonas Jerebko returned to Utah and got what he was looking for. Jerebko crashed the basket and tipped in a shot against his former team with 0.3 seconds remaining to lift the Golden State Warriors to a 124-123 victory over the Jazz on Friday night. ""My teammates knew this was a big game for me coming back here. I wanted to win and told them I really wanted this one,"" said Jerebko, who couldn't stop smiling after the victory. Kevin Durant, who scored 38 points, missed a running jumper. But Jerebko, who was let go by Utah as a free agent after last season and who was just subbed in to spread the floor with his long-range shooting ability, charged in from the right side and delivered the game-winning put-back. ""I took the ball out, so I knew I was going to give it to K.D. and I knew he was going to shoot it, so I just tried to get to the rim,"" Jerebko said. Jerebko, who finished with 10 points, punched the air in celebration and then was mobbed by his new teammates in a scene that looked more like a playoff game than the second game of the season. ""To win that game in that way, that was really special,"" Jerebko said. Durant thought his last shot was going down, but he couldn't have been happier for Jerebko. ""Jonas was there in the right place at the right time. It was very fitting that he comes back here and gets the game-winning tip. We were very excited for him afterwards,"" Durant said. The Jazz had taken their last lead when Jae Crowder scored off his own miss with 51.4 seconds left in the game. Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Draymond Green had 14 points, nine rebounds, six assists and a fistful of attitude. Joe Ingles paced the Jazz with 27 points, including seven 3-pointers, and Donovan Mitchell added 19 points, but missed all six of his fourth-quarter attempts. ""It's more physical,"" Mitchell said. ""They're taking away my easy looks. I just got to be able to hit the tougher shots. That's all it is."" Crowder had 17 points and Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 11 rebounds. Dante Exum gave the Jazz a 111-101 advantage with 8:53 left in the game. The Warriors responded with their most inspired defense of the night and went on a 13-0 run -- Draymond Green's layup made it 114-111 -- to set up the game-ending fireworks. High scores have been common in the first week of the NBA season, but the Jazz and Warriors took it to a new level, especially in the first half, which ended with Utah leading 81-69. In a role reversal, the Jazz were the ones letting shots fly from behind the arc with 46 3-point attempts. The Jazz made 19, while the Warriors made 10 of 19 from long range. After the Warriors whittled their 16-point deficit down to 3, Ingles beat the third-quarter buzzer with a running, double-pump 3-pointer from 37 feet. SHOOTING STARS? Ingles recently called himself the best shooter in the NBA. When asked about that claim, Stephen Curry joked, ""That just means in Las Vegas in summer league in 2009 we had two of the best shooters of all time on the same team. . We got a lot in common then."" Curry averaged 17.4 points in five summer league games for Golden State while teammate Ingles shot 20 percent from the field in scoring 3.2 points per game. NOT LIKE THE GOOD OL' DAYS As a member of the Chicago Bulls championship teams in the late 1990s, Kerr said this contest wasn't like the knock-down, drag-out games between Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen versus John Stockton and Karl Malone. ""I remember being in this building about 20 years ago in the Finals and literally, the final score was like the halftime score tonight. That shows you how much the game has changed."" TIP-INS Warriors: Allowing 47 points in the second quarter ties a record for a Golden State opponent. Atlanta did it first in 1990. ... There were 26 lead changes and 12 ties in the first half. ... Twice, Green pushed Gobert after fouls and the result of the second shoving match was double-technicals on Green and Favors. ...

Jazz: After the late evening tip, the game was stopped on the first play for several minutes because of a clock malfunction. ... The Jazz set a franchise record of 81 points in the first half. ...

"WASHINGTON --  All's going well for Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors at the moment, off to a 3-0 start and even winning without new star Kawhi Leonard in the second half of a back-to-back. Nothing's going right for John Wall and the Washington Wizards, 0-2 after a pair of losses at home and unable to rebound well while waiting for new big man Dwight Howard to make his season debut. Taking over while Leonard got a night off, Lowry delivered 28 points and 12 assists, and backup guard Fred VanVleet hit a key shot with 14.6 seconds left to help Toronto beat Washington 117-113 Saturday. ""We are never going to force anything,"" Lowry said about playing without Leonard, who was rested while his team was in action for the third time in four days. ""Whatever happens, I'm going to stay within the game, always trust my teammates in every situation."" Lowry sank a 3 before hopping into the lap of a front-row spectator, putting the Raptors ahead 109-101 with 3 minutes remaining, part of a personal seven-point run. Then came a key sequence: Lowry put up a shot that was knocked away near the rim by Otto Porter Jr.,  a play initially ruled goaltending. After a review, though, it was ruled a clean block. Play resumed with a jump ball at center court, Toronto got possession and a full shot clock. Lowry let time run down, and VanVleet put up an awkward, off-balance jumper that somehow went in. ""Tough shot,"" said Wall, who had 25 points and six assists. Said VanVleet: ""At that point, you just want to get a shot up and get an attempt, and I was able to knock it down."" Bradley Beal scored 32 points and became the career leader in 3-pointers for Washington, which finished the game without ejected coach Scott Brooks. Moments after Beal argued a call while on defense, he got incensed when he thought Toronto should have been called for a foul when Wall tumbled to the court on a drive to the basket. There was no whistle, though -- except for the technical foul on Beal. ""I disagreed with the call on John. He got tripped. The referee told me I ran up on him and so he called a tech. So I guess he felt threatened,"" Beal said. ""Next thing I know, Coach Brooks is gone."" Wall and Brooks got into it with the officials, resulting in Brooks' ejection. Lowry made two free throws to boost the Raptors' edge to 102-89. ""Frustration built up,"" Brooks said. ""We've got to play through whatever we think is against us. Just play through it. And quite honestly, I set a poor example."" This was a rematch from the opening round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last season, when the Raptors were seeded No. 1 and eliminated the No. 8 Wizards in six games. While Washington largely relies on the same core of players, it added Howard, who missed all of training camp, the preseason and the first two games with a sore backside. Ian Mahinmi started at center and did not exactly distinguish himself, accumulating more personal fouls (four) than points (two). Leonard averaged 27.5 points and 11 rebounds in his first two games with Toronto after arriving in a trade with the San Antonio Spurs. He only played in nine games for San Antonio in 2017-18, missing most because of a quadriceps injury. OG Anunoby started in place of Leonard and contributed 12 points -- all in the first half. ""We've got a spirited group,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said, ""that's ready to fight."" TIP-INS Raptors: Jonas Valanciunas and Serge Ibaka each scored 16. ... 15-4 against the Wizards over the last five years. Wizards: Outrebounded 52-37 overall and 14-9 on the offensive glass. ""If we keep getting out-rebounded the way we are,"" Wall said, ""we're going to keep finding ways to lose."" OP3? Brooks was critical of starting forward Otto Porter Jr., lamenting: ""Got to get yourself open"" and ""He has to play faster."" BEAL FOR 3 Beal surpassed Gilbert Arenas' previous team mark of 868 3s by making his 869th with a little more than 4 1/2 minutes left.","401070221"
"LOS ANGELES --  Once the fists started flying late in the fourth quarter, LeBron James' home debut with the Los Angeles Lakers was relegated to the undercard. A wild multiplayer fight that included the normally mild-mannered Chris Paul and Brandon Ingram stole part of the spotlight shining on LeBron's official landing on the West Coast. The Houston Rockets stole the rest with a gritty victory. James scored 24 points, but Paul, Ingram and Rajon Rondo all were ejected after trading blows late in the Rockets' 124-115 win Saturday night. Before the late drama overshadowed everything, James got several big ovations from a tremendously lively sellout crowd in his first home game since joining the Lakers as a free agent. ""The atmosphere was great,"" James said. ""The fans were extremely excited. We gave them everything that we could. Wish we could have gave them more with this win, but it was very electric."" But perhaps that energy -- and a flagrant foul by Houston's James Ennis III against Josh Hart earlier in the fourth quarter -- contributed to the shocking fight that broke out with 4:13 to play. The Rockets were clinging to a 109-108 lead when Ingram was called for a foul while trying to defend an aggressive drive by James Harden, who finished with 36 points. Furious with the call, Ingram shoved Harden and then confronted referee Jason Phillips after getting a technical foul. In the ensuing group argument, Paul stuck a finger into the face of Rondo, who responded by punching his fellow point guard. Ingram then threw punches in the melee. James attempted to break up the fight by grabbing Paul, his friend. Paul claimed Rondo caused their fight by spitting on him. ""Unacceptable,"" Houston's Carmelo Anthony said. ""We all know what happened. Ain't no need to keep going back and forth about that. What happened was unacceptable. It shouldn't have happened."" Rondo's teammates said they didn't know whether Paul's claim was accurate. Lakers coach Luke Walton said his players were playing with extra aggravation after Ennis clotheslined Hart on a flagrant foul 4  1/2 minutes earlier. ""I felt like the other team was trying to provoke us, and we fell for it,"" said the Lakers' Lance Stephenson, another peacemaker in the brawl. When tempers cooled after a nearly 10-minute break, Houston finished the game on a 15-8 run. Harden hit a key 3-pointer with 1:12 left to propel the Rockets to their first win of the season. ""We played amazing tonight, and I feel like the fight probably put us back,"" said JaVale McGee, who had 16 points and six rebounds in his own Lakers home debut. ""If there wasn't the fight, we probably would have won that game."" Paul had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds before getting tossed. Clint Capela had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Anthony scored seven points off the bench as Houston rebounded from an embarrassing season-opening loss to New Orleans. Rondo had 13 points and 10 assists before getting thrown out. LeBron also had five rebounds and five assists, but he went 1 for 8 in the fourth quarter, missing all three of his 3-point attempts. ""Yeah, James was James. That's what he does,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""I thought it was a great game. It had some intensity and quickness, and how fast it was."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden got a technical foul in the second quarter when he halfheartedly shoved Stephenson, who sold it impressively. ... Houston hasn't lost a season series with the Lakers since 2010-11. ... Gerald Green scored 13 points. Lakers: Ingram had 12 points before his ejection. ... Rookie C Moe Wagner wasn't ready for his home debut while he recovers from a bruised left knee. ... Lonzo Ball showed off his retooled jumper with four 3-pointers and 14 points. DISCIPLINE COMING The fight could leave with both teams without key rotation players due to suspension. NBA fights rarely get serious enough for the punches thrown by the principals in this brouhaha, and league discipline executive Kiki VanDeWeghe was actually in attendance. The Rockets are staying in LA to play the Clippers on Sunday night, and Houston coach Mike D'Antoni laughed at the possibility of a suspension for CP3. ""I don't know, I might rest him (on a) back-to-back,"" D'Antoni said. ""We'll see what the NBA says."" FIRST STEP The Lakers dropped to 0-2 after James' West Coast chapter formally began Thursday with a 128-119 road loss to the Trail Blazers. James scored 26 points in Portland, but the Lakers' team vibe could take many weeks to solidify before they can compete regularly with veteran playoff-contending rosters. The Rockets are a few months removed from reaching Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, and they've added Anthony to their attack. ""We've got a long way to go to get to the Rockets, to get to a lot of teams in the Western Conference,"" James said. ""They've just been together for so long. We'll learn from our mistakes and get better.""","401070222"
"LOS ANGELES --  Three games into his NBA career, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is getting used to playing in crunch time. The rookie is pretty good when it counts, too. Montrezl Harrell led a fourth-quarter charge by the Clippers' reserves with 17 points, Gilgeous-Alexander added 12 and Los Angeles defeated the Houston Rockets 115-112 on Sunday night. Clippers coach Doc Rivers debated different offensive and defensive lineups in the fourth, and finally settled on having Gilgeous-Alexander help defend James Harden. ""It was scary,"" Rivers said, at the same time explaining that he trusts all of his players. Gilgeous-Alexander's defense and his ball-handling skills give the Clippers greater options. ""We're all composed and not fazed by the moment,"" the rookie said. ""I'm always really confident in myself. I know how hard I work and it pays off."" Harrell and the bench helped the Clippers erase a four-point deficit late in the third, with Luc Mbah a Moute's 3-pointer giving them the lead for good. Tobias Harris led the Clippers with 23 points. Danilo Gallinari added 20 and Harrell had 10 rebounds. The Rockets were without Chris Paul against his old team. He began serving a two-game suspension for his involvement in an on-court fight against the Lakers on Saturday. ""You know how much we miss him, that's obvious, but still we had enough to win,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It shouldn't be an excuse. We should have played better."" Harden had 31 points and 14 assists one night after getting shoved by the Lakers' Brandon Ingram in a move that started the incident involving Paul. ""It is what it is,"" Harden said of the suspensions and fines handed down by the league. ""I don't know how to decide how many games."" Harden scored nine straight points to draw Houston within three with 29 seconds left. But his potential tying 3-pointer was short on the left side as time expired. ""He can really do everything on court so you have to try to make it difficult,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. The starless-Clippers earned their second win over one of the NBA's top teams, having beaten the Thunder without Russell Westbrook on Friday night. ""Two back-to-back really good efforts on the defensive end,"" said Lou Williams, who added 12 points. Team owner Steve Ballmer exhorted the crowd of 16,149 to ""Get up!"" during a timeout with 3:17 remaining in the game, waving his arms with a fierce look on his face. Harden was subjected to some smothering defense by Patrick Beverley in the game's opening minutes. Harden went down after inadvertently getting hit in the head by Beverley and the Rockets called timeout. Another time, Harden was on a drive to the basket when Beverley committed a hard foul that knocked down the Rockets star. Trailing by four, the Clippers closed the third on a 19-6 run to lead 93-83. Mbah a Moute had eight points and Harrell added four. Harrell tipped the ball away from P.J. Tucker on the final play and scored, drawing the foul and shimmying his way into high-fives with two courtside fans. ""That hurt us,"" D'Antoni said. ""We were guarding well up until we just had some mental lapses defensively and they took advantage of it."" Gallinari scored 11 of the Clippers' first 20 points of the third, countering Eric Gordon, who had 10 points early in the period starting in place of Paul. TIP-INS Rockets: Besides his suspension, Paul was fined a total of $491,782 for his role in the fracas. Paul wasn't at Staples Center on Sunday. ... They lost in the second game of their first back-to-back of the season. The Rockets were 10-3 in such situations last season. Clippers: They ended a two-game skid against the Rockets.","401070223"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo explains how important it was for him to play in an NBA game on Christmas Day. (1:35) NEW YORK --  Giannis Antetokounmpo was so eager to make a rim-rocking Christmas debut that he overshot the basket on his first attempt, a dunk from one side that ended with the ball all the way in the opposite corner. ""I was so excited that I went a little bit too high and I thought the rim was a foot taller,"" Antetokounmpo said. He and the Milwaukee Bucks eventually settled down and showed they belonged on the holiday stage. Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 14 rebounds, and Milwaukee celebrated its return to the Christmas schedule by beating the New York Knicks 109-95 on Tuesday. ""This is one of the highest stages,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Special teams play Christmas Day, and just it's an opportunity for us and we're really happy."" Brook Lopez scored 20 points for the Bucks, who played on Christmas for the first time since 1977. They were selected for the showcase slate of games largely because of Antetokounmpo but the timing also was perfect to show an emerging team, which improved the NBA's second-best record to 23-10. Malcolm Brogdon finished with 17 points for the Bucks, the NBA scoring leaders who bounced back from a season-low 87 points in a loss to Miami on Saturday to win for the fifth time in six games. ""People come to see Giannis play but they've got to watch all of us, so it's definitely a great opportunity for the rest of us to showcase as a team what we can do,"" Brogdon said. Rookie Kevin Knox scored 21 points for the Knicks, who have lost six straight Christmas Day games and fell to 22-31 in their NBA-record 53 appearances on the holiday. ""It's on me to stay even in this whole thing, not be up and down emotionally because I (have) to keep their spirits up,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""They feel it. They're human."" New York has lost five in a row and 10 of 11 since rallying to stun the Bucks 136-134 in overtime on Dec. 1 at Madison Square Garden. Antetokounmpo was angry that night with Knicks forward Mario Hezonja, who had dunked over him in the first quarter, then stared and stepped over him. Antetokounmpo felt it was disrespectful, vowing to punch Hezonja in the groin next time. The Greek Freak was perhaps a little too pumped for the rematch -- Brogdon grabbed the rebound of his errant dunk in the corner and fired in a 3-pointer -- but he quickly got untracked. It was only a seven-point game midway through the third quarter when Antetokounmpo began to seize control. His jumper followed by layup pushed the lead into double digits, and he scored 11 points in the Bucks' 36-point period that ended with them leading 84-68 cushion. ""We played them really (well) in the first half -- down two -- in the locker room felt pretty good,"" Knox said. ""But that third quarter, defensively, offensively, just something slips with us."" Noah Vonleh had 14 points and 15 rebounds, while Tim Hardaway Jr. had 14 points and 10 boards but shot just 4 for 18 for New York. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo was chosen Eastern Conference player of the week on Monday, the third time this season he's won the award. He was also voted the player of the month in the conference for October-November. ... The Bucks are 3-2 on Christmas. Knicks: Rookie G Allonzo Trier had eight points in 18 minutes after missing seven games with a strained left hamstring. ... Hezonja didn't play. ... The Knicks haven't won on Christmas since beating Boston in 2011 in what was the NBA season opener following the lockout. ADVANTAGE, BUCKS? Both coaches were asked about the idea that a Christmas Day game favored the visiting team, which could treat it as a regular road game while the hosts were at home, perhaps surrounded by family celebrating the holiday. Milwaukee's Mike Budenholzer dismissed the notion, saying the Bucks brought plenty of family members and had a big team dinner on Christmas Eve so they could mix basketball and the holiday. Fizdale's thoughts? ""Well, I look at this team, Milwaukee's coming in with an advantage anyway,"" he said with a laugh. ""They're a better team than us right now."" KNICKS' KNOX Knox had his third straight 20-point outing. He came in averaging 20.3 points in his previous seven games.","401070233"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden is on a roll and it's helping the Houston Rockets get on track after their terrible start to the season. Harden scored 41 points and the Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-109 on Tuesday for their seventh win in the last eight games. Harden has scored 30 points or more in a career-high seven games in a row, marking the first time a player has done that since Russell Westbrook had eight consecutive 30-point games in November 2016. He has scored at least 35 in his last five, which is the longest such streak since Carmelo Anthony did it in six games in April 2013. The Rockets won just one of their first six games this season and were 11-14 after a three-game skid in early December. Since then, powered by Harden's dominance, Houston has lost just once to improve to 18-15 and move a season-high three games above .500. ""We've had that confidence all year,"" Harden said. ""Our record isn't where we want it to be, but it's getting there. And we've got to continue to work hard every day, continue to get better and grow. We're preparing for a postseason. We're not going to be at our tip top right now."" A 3-pointer by Paul George with less than two minutes left got Oklahoma City within 4 before Harden missed a 3. Westbrook missed a shot for the Thunder, but George stole the ball from Harden and was fouled by him. George made both free throws to get the Thunder within 2 with 43.6 seconds left. Harden then drove past George and into the lane for a layup to make it 112-108 with 20.4 seconds left. Westbrook made 1 of 2 free throws to cut it to 3 with 15 seconds left, and Austin Rivers made a free throw with 7.4 seconds left to secure the win. George had 28 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder, and Westbrook added 21 points with nine rebounds and nine assists. ""We had some bad bounces which got them a couple of extra possessions which got them some open 3s,"" George said. Harden became the first player to score 40 or more points on Christmas since Kevin Durant had 44 for the Thunder in 2010. Harden's latest big game came as the Rockets played without Chris Paul, who missed his second straight game with a strained left hamstring. The 9-time All-Star is out for at least the next two weeks with the injury suffered Thursday night. ""We've got a lot of guys playing at a high level right now,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""So many guys contributed (Tuesday). Clint Capela had 16 points and tied a season high with 23 rebounds. The Rockets were up by 6 with about four minutes left when Rivers, whom they signed on Monday, hit a 3-pointer to make it 107-98. Grant scored five straight points for the Thunder, highlighted by a 3-pointer, to get Oklahoma City to within 107-103, but Rivers made another 3 to push the lead to 7 with two minutes left. ""Everybody here has welcomed me so it has been a very easy transition,"" Rivers said. ""So my whole focus has just been to play hard and just try to help them in any way I can."" Houston had a 1-point lead in the fourth when Harden re-entered the game and found Capela on consecutive possessions for dunks to make it 100-95. Eric Gordon had a layup seconds later to push the lead to 7. Harden continued the run after the timeout with a driving jump shot before the Thunder scored their first basket in more than three minutes on a layup by Grant to cut the lead to 104-97. The Thunder were up by 8 at halftime, but Houston scored the first eight points of the second half to tie it at 60 with about nine minutes remaining in the third quarter. Danuel House and P.J. Tucker made 3s in that stretch to lead the Rockets. Oklahoma City was up by 2 later in the third when the Rockets scored five quick points with a 3 from Harden to take a 73-70 lead. But George hit a 3 for the Thunder soon after that to tie it up again. That basket started a 10-2 run for Oklahoma City, which included another 3 from George that made it 80-75 with about three minutes left in the third. Houston trailed by 4 after two free throws by George late in the third, but the Rockets scored the next six points, capped by a 3 from Harden, to take an 86-84 lead with less than a minute left in the quarter. The Thunder led 88-86 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook received a technical in the second quarter for yelling at an official when he thought he was fouled on a 3-point attempt. ...  Steven Adams had 17 points and seven rebounds. ... The Thunder made nine of 30 3-pointers. Rockets: Rivers scored 10 in his Houston debut. ...

"Kyrie Irving explains what it means to play in front of family members on Christmas, and he recognizes them as a good-luck charm. (0:39) BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving extended the game with a clutch shot, then ended it with two more in overtime. Irving scored six of his 40 points in overtime, hitting back-to-back 3-pointers while leading Boston back from a five-point deficit as the Celtics beat the 76ers 121-114 on Tuesday night. ""Just competition at its highest. I love going against the best. It's not too often you get to do that in the regular season, especially on a holiday like Christmas,"" said Irving, who also pulled down 10 rebounds. ""I got to open presents with my family this morning then come into work. It was great."" It came very close to not being so great for Boston, which needed Irving's fadeaway jumper from 13-feet out to tie it at 108 with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter, forcing the OT. The Sixers, much improved from the team that lost here 105-87 in the season-opener, scored the first five points of OT, but could not stop Irving when they needed to -- again. ""There aren't many in his weight class,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""Inevitably, you've got to stop him."" Irving hit a 3-pointer with 2:01 left to put Boston up 115-114, then struck again from 30-feet with 1:29 remaining in the OT and the Celtics held on to improve to 2-0 against Philadelphia this season. Jayson Tatum and Marcus Morris scored 23 apiece for Boston and Terry Rozier had 10 points. Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 34 points, making 12 of 12 free throws, and pulled down 16 rebounds. Jimmy Butler scored 24, JJ Redick had 17 points and Ben Simmons added 11 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists for the Sixers. Simmons' two free throws with 2:15 left to put the Sixers up 114-112, but Philadelphia didn't score again. ""These are the type of games that challenge you mentally, and we made sure that we stayed with it and finished it,"" said Al Horford, who scored just four points but pulled down nine rebounds and helped mitigate the Sixers' size advantage inside. The Celtics led 57-51 at halftime, but Philadelphia used a 15-2 run in the third while shooting 60 percent in the period and led 89-86 entering the fourth. Philadelphia shot 60 percent in the third quarter, hitting five 3-pointers, and led 89-86 entering the final quarter. It stayed tight through the end of the fourth. Chandler got open for a 3-pointer with 37 seconds left and the Sixers led 108-106, then Irving pulled up for a 13-foot jumper to tie it at 108 with 20 seconds left. Redick missed a jumper just before the buzzer and the game went into OT. GETTING BETTER The Sixers-Celtics rivalry isn't quite back to where it once was, but it is getting closer. Boston beat Philadelphia 4-1 in the second round of the playoffs last season and won the first two meetings this season, although the Sixers had not yet picked up Butler in a trade with Minnesota before Boston's 105-87 win on Oct. 16. The next two meetings are in Philadelphia. ""Obviously those guys have gotten better. It's definitely tougher -- no question,"" Horford said. CLUTCH KYRIE Irving said Butler had him covered well and forced him to put some extra arch on his game-tying fadeaway at the end of the fourth. Butler agreed. ""He hit a tough shot. That's what he does. That's why he is the player that he is,"" Butler said. LACK OF OTs: This was only the second game on Christmas Day since 2004 that went to overtime. Miami's win over New Orleans in 2015 was the only other one. TIP-INS: 76ers: Wilson Chandler returned after missing Saturday's win over Toronto with a left quad contusion.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  LeBron James prides himself in his durability, being available night after night, game after grueling game. That's why the Lakers star is so mad he got hurt. The Los Angeles Lakers lost LeBron in the third quarter to a strained left groin then went out and beat the two-time defending champions without him Tuesday night, getting King James' 17 points, 13 rebounds and five assists before the injury in a surprising 127-101 rout of the Golden State Warriors. ""I take a lot of pride in it,"" James said of always playing. ""That's why it (angered me) not to be able to go back into the game. It's more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That's something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it's not a long thing."" James grabbed at his left groin area with 7:51 left in the third after slipping under the Warriors' basket while trying for a loose ball. He tried to stretch it out, awkwardly walked toward the Lakers bench trying to loosen up before leaving on his own though gingerly out the tunnel for the locker room. ""I wasn't able to go back into the game, obviously. I'll get an MRI tomorrow and see what's up,"" James said. ""With me with injuries, I'm never too concerned about them. I was able to walk off on my own power. I felt a pop, see if I could stretch it a few times, see if it would relieve but it didn't. ... I did a couple exercises to see if I could continue to go but I didn't feel like it would benefit my team or me. So I came back and got a jump start on the rehab."" He is scheduled for an MRI exam Wednesday and coach Luke Walton is preparing to be without James on Thursday night in Sacramento. James has played in 156 straight games overall and 116 in the regular season. And he's not about to guess whether he will have to miss time. Stephen Curry made consecutive 3s shortly after James exited, and the Warriors got within 78-76 at the 2:48 mark of the third -- but Kyle Kuzma and the persistent Lakers stayed at it every possession. Curry wound up with 15 points but the home fans had seen enough well before the final buzzer and headed out for the rest of Christmas. ""They played like they had nothing to lose. They played like they had a free swing,"" Curry said. ""Everybody who touched the ball was aggressive. They just had a different look in their eye and we weren't able to match that. They went out and won the game, that's basically it."" Kuzma contributed 19 points with a pretty baseline 3 late, Ivica Zubac had 18 points and 11 rebounds and Rajon Rondo 15 points and 10 assists off the bench as the Lakers snapped an 11-game losing streak on the Warriors' home floor since a 118-115 overtime win Dec. 22, 2012. Los Angeles also ended a seven-game skid overall in the rivalry with its first win in the series since March 6, 2016. James made it look easy early on shooting over Jonas Jerebko and Kevon Looney. James hit a turnaround jumper at the 4:39 mark of the second quarter to put the Lakers ahead 52-37 and L.A. led 65-50 at the break. It was James' second straight Christmas game at Oracle Arena after playing here with the Cavaliers last year and losing 99-92. Walton -- a former Warriors top assistant and dear friend of Steve Kerr -- got some time with his Hall of Fame dad, Bill, before the game and a few moments to catch up with Curry and share holiday greetings in the hallway after the two-time MVP's warmup routine. Kevin Durant, playing on a tender left ankle, had 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Andre Iguodala came off the bench and made his initial five shots and 7 of 9 by halftime on the way to a season-high 23 points while also handling some of the load defending James. Golden State shot just 9 for 36 from deep, Curry going 2 of 8 and Durant 3 for 8. MCGEE's RING DELAYED Lakers center JaVale McGee was still sick with a respiratory infection and missed his fifth straight game, didn't travel and missed his scheduled moment to receive his championship ring. That will now happen Feb. 2 when the Lakers return to Oracle Arena. McGee was one of three big men who rotated in Steve Kerr's rotation on the way to a repeat title. ""I'm happy for JaVale. He's getting more of a chance to play with the Lakers than he did with us,"" Kerr said. ""We had a lot of centers play a really important role for us the last couple of years. He was fantastic and we loved having him here. Wish he was here and that we could give him his ring today, but we'll do it next time. Very happy for him and his success this year."" TIP-INS Lakers: Zubac shot 9 for 10. ... The Lakers had lost three of four, so this meant a lot. ... Los Angeles improved to 5-6 on the road vs. the Western Conference. ... Tyson Chandler, who had been questionable with back spasms after he missed Sunday's game against Memphis, returned and played 15-plus minutes. Warriors:  Iguodala reached double figures for the fourth time this season. ... Curry and Draymond Green each picked up two early fouls, and Green fouled out with 5:36 left. He was limited to four points, five assists and five rebounds.","401070236"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Tough defense has reemerged as a staple for Utah. It starts with Rudy Gobert. Gobert has seemingly regained the edge he possessed last season when he won NBA Defensive Player of the Year honors. His attitude and energy is spreading to his teammates and turning the Jazz into a nightmare matchup for most opponents once again. Gobert totaled 18 points, 14 rebounds and a season-high seven blocks to lead Utah to a 117-96 victory over Portland on Tuesday night. He spearheaded a defensive effort that resulted in the Trail Blazers shooting just 39 percent from the floor and become the 11th Jazz opponent to fail to reach 100 points this season. ""Our mindset has changed over the last few games,"" Gobert said. ""We want to play defense and we're having fun playing defense. It changes the way we play."" Gobert's seven blocks were three more than his previous season-high, which he tallied on four occasions. The Jazz center described himself as giving 200 percent in the game and Utah coach Quin Snyder felt like Gobert made his presence felt over the entire court. ""It's what we need from him,"" Snyder said. ""He can still protect the rim and also be impactful on the floor."" Donovan Mitchell added 19 points for Utah. Joe Ingles chipped in 15 points, seven rebounds, and five assists for the Jazz. Utah (17-18) won for the fifth time in their last six home games while shooting 55 percent from the floor. The Jazz have won 10 of 11 games this season where they have shot 50 percent or better as a team. Damian Lillard score 20 points to lead Portland. Evan Turner added 12 points off the bench. The Blazers (19-15) lost to Utah for the second time in five days after trailing nearly the entire second half by a double digit margin. ""They're a really good defensive team,"" Lillard said. ""They make you work on the offensive end. You got to compete on the offensive end."" Jae Crowder scored seven of Utah's first nine second-quarter points, starting with the team's first 3-pointer of the game, to cap a 9-0 run that gave the Jazz a 33-26 lead. The Blazers pulled within three on three different occasions. Lillard hit a couple of baskets to cut the deficit to a basket, then fed Jusuf Nurkic for a layup to trim Utah's lead to 43-40. The Jazz pulled away before halftime behind hot shooting from the perimeter. Ingles and Crowder buried back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a 16-5 run. Mitchell finished it off by beating the shot clock with another outside basket, giving the Jazz a 59-45 lead. Utah went 5-of-7 from 3-point range in the second quarter after going 0-of-8 in the first quarter. ""We know how we want to score and how we want to attack these guys,"" Crowder said. ""We believe in our shots. We believe in the work we put in."" The Jazz extended their lead to 68-51 on back-to-back baskets from Ricky Rubio early in the third quarter. Portland chipped away at the lead and finally cut it to 92-83 on a floater from Seth Curry early in the fourth quarter. That's as close as the Blazers got. Gobert answered with a dunk to push Utah's lead back to double digits. It sparked a 14-2 run that slammed the door shut on any potential comeback. Mitchell punctuated the run with a 3-pointer, putting the Jazz up 106-85 with 4:49 remaining. Mitchell thinks Utah is ready to turn the corner heading into the new year because the team is learning how to finish games defensively. ""We've been in this situation at the beginning of the year and we didn't have a counter-punch,"" Mitchell said. ""Now we're adjusting and making that counter-punch. It's similar to what we had last year. And we have more. We have more to us."" CHRISTMAS CAMEO Playing on Christmas day is a rare occurrence for Utah. The Jazz played for just the seventh time on Dec. 25 and improved to 5-2 on the holiday. Their previous game on the holiday came in 1997 when John Stockton scored 24 points to lead the Jazz to a 107-103 victory over Houston. SHUT DOWN C.J. McCollum finished with only 11 points on 4-of-14 shooting against the Jazz. McCollum came into the game averaging 19.8 points in his last four games against Utah. The veteran guard has scored at least 20 points in 154 games since the start of the 2015-16 season, which is the 13th most in the NBA in that span. QUOTABLE ""He affects shots and his presence affects shots,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts on Gobert's play keeping the Blazers from finishing at the rim. TIP INS Blazers: Lillard did not attempt a free throw. He came into the game ranked fourth in the NBA in free throws made and eighth in the league in attempts. ... Portland scored 14 points off 17 Utah turnovers. ... The Blazers made just 35 baskets against the Jazz for the second time this season. Jazz: Gobert has logged a double-double in nine of his last 10 games against the Blazers. ... Dante Exum matched his season-high with 15 points off the bench. ... Utah shot 13-of-21 (61.9 percent) from 3-point range over the final three quarters.","401070237"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Jahlil Okafor stepped into the starting lineup for the injured Anthony Davis and had his best game of the season. Okafor scored a season-high 20 points, matched a season best with 10 rebounds and added two blocks to help the balanced New Orleans Pelicans beat the reeling Memphis Grizzlies 105-85 on Monday. The Pelicans played their first game since announcing Davis would miss 1-2 weeks with a left index finger sprain. Okafor filled in nicely. ""My teammates were very supportive of me, rooting me on, cheering me on, talking to me on the bench. That made my job real easy,"" Okafor said. Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic scored 21 points each and Julius Randle had 20 for New Orleans, which snapped a two-game skid. The Pelicans put the game away in the second half, outscoring Memphis 51-35, including a 13-1 rally late in the third. New Orleans shot 51 percent in the final two quarters and made 8 of 14 from outside the arc after a poor-shooting first half from 3-point range. ""That second half, third quarter was huge for us after I made a couple of 3s,"" said Mirotic, who was 4 of 8 from outside the arc in the second half. ""When we play this way unselfishly, everything is easier."" Despite Davis' absence and his 13.3 rebounds a game, the Pelicans dominated the boards 50-35. Meanwhile, Memphis has lost six straight and 12 of 13. Several games ago, the theme of the skid was frustration; Monday it was humiliation, particularly since the game was part of the city's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day festivities. ""It's really embarrassing on a day like today that I think is very special to all of us,"" said point guard Mike Conley, who had 20 points and eight assists for Memphis. ""For us to play the way we did -- especially in the second half -- is unacceptable."" The Grizzlies have injury problems, and there has been drama from locker-room scuffles to jettisoning high-paid, oft-injured Chandler Parsons from the team. ""We're kind of beat,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of the Memphis malaise. ""We allow one play to impact the next play and then it impacts the next play. The next thing you know, it's one of those runs that are happening."" Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 22 points, as Memphis was limited to 38 percent shooting in the game, after making 10 of 20 in the first quarter. TIP-INS Pelicans: Played the final game of a five-game trip. ... Have played three times in Memphis on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. ... Okafor started his fourth game of the season. ... New Orleans was 1 of 12 on 3-pointers in the first half, but finished the game 9 of 26. ... Okafor's previous season high was 17 points against Milwaukee on Dec. 19. ... Double-doubles by Okafor, Holiday and Randle marked the 11th time this season three New Orleans players recorded double-doubles. It was Okafor's first double-double since Feb. 25, 2017. Grizzlies: Are now 7-10 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. ... Played the opening game of a season-high five-game homestand. ... Gasol returned after missing the Grizzlies' loss Saturday in Toronto with back soreness. ... F Omri Casspi was a late scratch (illness). MLK HONOREES Former stars Chris Bosh, Wayne Embry, Candace Parker and Bill Walton were honored during the day's festivities as this year's 14th Annual National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award winners. The quartet was selected for its ""dedicated and significant contributions to civil and human rights and for laying the foundation for future leaders through their career in sports in the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.""","401070238"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid relished the chance to face James Harden, and wasn't going to let a little back tightness stop him. Embiid had 32 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers past fellow MVP contender Harden and the Houston Rockets 121-93 on Monday night. ""I love playing against guys you guys say are better than me,"" Embiid said. Harden, selected Western Conference player of the week earlier in the day, finished with 37 points -- giving him 20 straight games with at least 30. Philadelphia played without four-time All-Star Jimmy Butler (sore right wrist), and Embiid more than made up for his absence. ""It was really fun for us,"" Embiid said. ""Don't think it was fun for them."" Embiid was questionable before the game with lower back soreness and coach Brett Brown hinted during pregame it might be best for the Philadelphia big man to sit this one out. Embiid clearly had other intentions. ""I want to fight with my teammates,"" he said. ""Whatever I have to do, I'll do for my team."" His 24 first-half points helped Philadelphia to a 65-50 halftime lead, and he punctuated an entertaining opening 24 minutes by pinning Harden's layup attempt with 7.5 seconds left for a crowd-pleasing block. The duo had to be separated with 38.7 seconds left in the half, with each being issued a technical, after Harden took exception to Embiid's foul on him. The 76ers broke the game open in a dominant third quarter as they outscored Houston 29-13 to take a 94-63 advantage into the fourth. Ben Simmons stole Harden's pass, made a layup and finished a three-point play after being fouled by Harden to make it 73-52. The lead kept growing, getting as large as 31. ""We were due for a game like this,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. Harden had 10 points in the third but missed four of six field goal tries as the 76ers hounded him defensively with double-teams and different looks. A tired-looking Harden's air ball with 12.3 seconds left in the third showed the effects of the Philadelphia defense -- and, perhaps, Harden's offensive workload. With the game out of range, Harden sat in the fourth. ""This is not a great way to rest him, but we rested him today,"" D'Antoni said. BREWER'S DEFENSE Corey Brewer frustrated Harden for part of the night. On a 10-day contract, Brewer replaced Butler in the starting lineup and was tasked with guarding Harden. Brewer was a gnat for the first 24 minutes, following Harden wherever he went. Harden took exception to Brewer guarding him without the ball 80 feet from the basket, pushing the 76ers forward behind the play. Harden wasn't called for a foul on that play, but picked up his third with 29.1 seconds left in the first half when he shoved Brewer away -- again causing the sold-out crowd to erupt in cheers. Brewer is happy to be back in uniform and making an impact. ""I get to play basketball,"" he said. ""I was sitting home playing with my kids, playing superheroes every day."" ANTHONY TRADE A person with direct knowledge of the matter said the Rockets are trading Carmelo Anthony and an undisclosed amount of cash to the Bulls in a deal that is expected to be completed Tuesday. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday because the trade still needs league approval. The Bulls have no plans to play Anthony and will look to either trade him before the Feb. 7 deadline or ultimately waive him and make him a free agent. The trade ends a short-lived saga in Houston for Anthony, who averaged 13.4 points in 10 games with the Rockets. He has not played since Nov. 8. FARIED SIGNED Houston signed Kenneth Faried before the game after he was waived by the Nets on Saturday. In 12 games with Brooklyn this season, Faried averaged 5.1 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. ""He brings energy, athleticism and runs the floor,"" D'Antoni said. ""The way we play will complement him, and he'll complement us."" In order to sign Faried, the Rockets waived James Nunnally. Faried had 13 points and six rebounds in 23 minutes. TIP-INS Rockets: G Chris Paul (strained left hamstring) missed his 15th straight game. G Brandon Knight (sore left knee) also sat out. C Clint Capela (right thumb surgery) is out four to six weeks. ... Houston was held under 100 points for the 10th time, dropping to 2-8 in those games. 76ers: Philadelphia improved to 20-4 at home. ... Landry Shamet had 18 points and JJ Redick added 16.","401070239"
"LOS ANGELES --  Nothing could stop Klay Thompson, certainly not the Lakers' defense. The Golden State Warriors made sure of it, too, setting screens and calling plays for the star guard, who tied an NBA record by making his first 10 attempts from 3-point range on his way to scoring 44 points in a 130-111 victory Monday night. ""I've never hit 10 3s in a row in a game. That's hard to do,"" Thompson said. ""I just happened to be on tonight and I'm happy I was able to do it in front of my family."" The Warriors equaled a season high with their eighth consecutive victory. The two-time defending champions won their seventh straight road game, too. ""They're starting to find their stride, not just against us, but against the league,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. Thompson stopped and popped from everywhere, finishing 10 of 11 from beyond the arc and 17 of 20 from the floor overall. ""We kind of sold out to look for Klay, to be honest,"" Kevin Durant said. ""When you're knocking shots down like that, you have to continue to feed him until he goes cold and tonight I didn't see that in sight."" Thompson had 23 points in the third quarter, connecting on seven 3s as the Warriors stretched their lead to 36. He hopped and let his right arm hang in the air after hitting his seventh while Golden State fans at Staples Center cheered. He finally missed from deep late in the period. ""We had two, three guys flying at him,"" Walton said. Durant added 20 points and Stephen Curry had 11 points and 12 assists, going 2 of 10 from 3-point range for the Warriors. ""We had 41 assists tonight, so the ball was moving and Klay was just spectacular,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Emblematic of his quiet offensive night, Curry came dribbling in alone for a fast-break dunk, but slipped and fell, drawing gasps from the crowd. He scrambled to his feet, got the ball back and put up an air ball. ""That was funny,"" Thompson said. ""That'll definitely be on `Shaqtin a Fool."" Ivica Zubac led Los Angeles with 18 points. Brandon Ingram added 17 and Kyle Kuzma had 16. The Lakers were without their primary ball-handlers and playmakers in LeBron James, Lonzo Ball and Rajon Rondo. They fell to 5-9 without James, whose left groin strain has forced him out for the longest stretch of his 16-year career. Coming off a split in two straight overtime games, the Lakers kept it close in the first half, trailing 65-55 at the break. Golden State had just six 3s at halftime. But Thompson fired up a 3-pointer -- the first of Golden State's nine in the third quarter -- and the Warriors went on to outscore the Lakers 45-25 to lead 110-80 going into the fourth. Golden State's sharpshooting silenced the crowd and allowed the Warriors to sit four of their five starters in the fourth, leaving DeMarcus Cousins in for a bit until he also went to the bench. Cousins had eight points, nine rebounds, five assists and four fouls in his second game for the Warriors since being out nearly a year with a severe knee injury. The Warriors have made 141 3-pointers to 93 for opponents during their eight-game winning streak. TIP-INS Warriors: All 12 players scored. ... Their other eight-game winning streak this season was Oct. 22 to Nov. 5. ... Evened the season series 1-1, having lost 127-101 on Christmas. Lakers: Walton hopes James is able to return this week when the Lakers have five straight games at Staples Center. ... Ball is out four to six weeks with a left ankle sprain. ... Walton said Rondo (right ring finger surgery) could return on Thursday, but he's not as confident about James. ... Josh Hart had six points, one assist and four fouls starting in place of Ball. ... Jack Nicholson made a rare courtside appearance. Mahershala Ali, Snoop Dogg, James Franco, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao were in the crowd. PLEASING THE PARENTS Thompson was going to catch up with his father, former Laker Mychal Thompson, afterward. ""He'll probably just tell me, `Good job, should have had 50. Should have gone for 50,"" the younger Thompson said. ""It's never good enough for your parents."" BELL VS KERR Warriors reserve Jordan Bell had a sideline exchange with Kerr. Bell scored two points in seven minutes. ""Coach will always, especially the younger guys in the league, definitely be on them a little bit more because he expects a lot out of them,"" Durant said. ""He lets us know what he sees out there and if you have something to say to him back, he's not going to be afraid to go back at you. He sees the potential in him. That stuff happens, so we'll move on.""","401070240"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Tony Parker said he'd never seen anything like it in his 18 seasons in the NBA. The Charlotte Hornets went small ball -- like really, really small ball -during a stretch to start the fourth quarter and nearly overcame a 20-point deficit before falling 113-112 to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. Antetokounmpo had 25 points, 18 rebounds and eight assists and made two free throws with 23.7 seconds left for the go-ahead score as the Bucks held off late rally and a 41-point performance from Hornets point guard Kemba Walker to earn the win. ""We can't give them the chance to believe that they can come back, they have a great team they have guys that can knock down 3's and get the crowd into it and comeback,"" Antetokounmpo said. Hornets first-year coach James Borrego turned to what Parker called an ""unorthodox approach"" with his team down 10 entering the fourth quarter. He sent out a lineup that included the 6-foot-1 Walker, Parker (6-2), Malik Monk (6-3), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (6-7) and Nic Batum (6-8). Kidd-Gilchrist and Batum, who were guards last season, spent time covering Antetokounmpo on defense. And it worked. Led by Walker, the Hornets caught fire from the outside and got easy looks in transition. They stuck with it for most of the fourth quarter and took their only lead of the game with 36.3 seconds on a pair of free throws by Walker. But Walker missed a driving layup with 3.4 seconds left. The loose ball got kicked outside, where Batum misfired on a 3-pointer from the left wing at the buzzer. ""That lineup was small, super small,"" Parker said with a laugh. ""But we came back."" Walker said he had never played with a unit that small before. Batum laughed and said it was the first time he's ever played center. ""We tried to counter and go big and there were some possessions where big looked good,"" said Bucks new coach Mike Budenholzer. ""But then I think we lost track of some shooters."" When asked if that type of lineup is sustainable, Parker said, ""It depends on the matchups. Some nights we can do it. Some nights we won't be able to do it."" TIP INS Bucks: Khris Middleton had 19 points and Eric Bledsoe added 17 as the Bucks set out on the quest to reach the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons. ... Brook Lopez 14 points in his debut for the Bucks after signing a one-year contract in the offseason. Hornets: Malik Monk had 18 points, while Parker had eight points and seven assists in his first game with the Hornets after 17 seasons with the Spurs. BUCKS SHOOTING: Budenholzer stressed spacing and perimeter shooting to open up more 1-on-1 opportunities for the 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo to drive the lane. It certainly opened up some 3-point chances as the Bucks used that spacing to knock down 11 of 22 3-point attempts in the first half to build a 67-54 halftime lead. ""Love the way we started the game, loved the way we played a lot in the first half, just got to find a way to do that for 48 minutes,"" Budenholzer said. WALKER BUMMED Despite setting a franchise record for points scored in a season opener, Walker was mad at himself after the game for missing the potential winning layup. ""I just missed it,"" Walker said. ""I took my eyes off the rim. I'm (upset). It's going to eat me up tonight."" But Eric Bledsoe, who covered Walker most of the game, was certainly impressed with the two-time All-Star's effort. ""He had what, 41 points?  I guess I didn't do too good"" guarding him, Bledsoe joked. ""He's a tough guard man.  I thought everybody locked in on him down the stretch and kind of helped me out a little bit.  It's a team game."" CELEBRATING 30 YEARS Charlotte wore its throwback white jerseys with pinstripes and they celebrated 30 years of basketball. Several members of the original 1988-89 team were introduced before the game, including Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry, Rex Chapman and Kelly Tripucka.","401070693"
"DETROIT --  It took the Detroit Pistons over three minutes to score in their first game under new coach Dwane Casey. Then at the end, they committed two straight shot-clock violations while trying to close out the victory. After all that, the Pistons won anyway. ""We'll take it,"" Casey said. ""In this league, you've got to celebrate the wins. I've said it all along. We've got to have fun. We can't have the gloom-and-doom situations. There's going to be adversity in the NBA."" Andre Drummond had 24 points and 20 rebounds, and Detroit won its opener under Casey, 103-100 over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. Blake Griffin added 26 points for the Pistons, who were without two potential starters but still managed to hold off Brooklyn. Caris LeVert equaled a career high with 27 points for the Nets, and he drove to the basket in the final seconds with Brooklyn down one. LeVert lost the ball, and it went out of bounds to Detroit. ""There were too many bodies in the lane, and I should have backed it out and got us a better look,"" LeVert said. ""I needed to slow down, but I gave them a chance to knock the ball away."" Reggie Jackson made two free throws for the Pistons with 6.2 seconds remaining, and Joe Harris missed a 3-pointer from near the top of the key at the other end. The Pistons hired Casey this offseason after moving on from Stan Van Gundy, and his debut began inauspiciously. The Nets scored the game's first eight points, and Brooklyn's Jarrett Allen made an impressive defensive play early when he blocked Griffin's dunk attempt. The Nets led by as many as 12 points in the first quarter, but it was tied at 51 at halftime. ""That first quarter was scary,"" Drummond said. ""You know, had first-game jitters. ... We were a little all over the place in the beginning."" Detroit opened a 13-point lead in the third quarter, but then it was Brooklyn's turn to rally. The Pistons led 101-96 when Spencer Dinwiddie went to the line for the Nets. Dinwiddie made a free throw but missed the second. Brooklyn came up with the rebound, and Harris made a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to one. The Pistons then committed a shot clock violation, but Allen missed at the other end. After another shot clock violation, LeVert tried his drive toward the basket but came up empty. The Pistons were without Stanley Johnson (toe) and Reggie Bullock (illness). Brooklyn was not at full strength, either. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was out because of a left adductor injury. The Nets lost their sixth straight season opener. TRIBUTE The Pistons honored Aretha Franklin before the game by playing a recording of her singing the national anthem. Former Pistons star Isiah Thomas spoke briefly, asking for a moment of silence for Franklin, who died in August. After the moment of silence, and with no additional announcement, a recording of Franklin singing the anthem at the 2004 NBA Finals began playing while pictures scrolled on the scoreboard screen. A microphone was left unattended at midcourt while the anthem played. TOUGH STRETCH Detroit went on a 20-4 run in the third quarter and led 73-60 after a 3-pointer by Jackson. ""I thought the third quarter, that's where we kind of lost it,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We turned the ball over a bunch, they got out and ran, and that's where they got their separation."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn was also without DeMarre Carroll (right ankle), Allen Crabbe (left ankle), Shabazz Napier (right hamstring) and Alan Williams (left ankle). ... Dinwiddie had 23 points. Pistons: Jackson scored 19 points. ... Drummond made a 3-pointer , the sixth of his career.","401070694"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan kept asking his team to focus on defense and rebounding during the offseason. He witnessed the results of both Wednesday night. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 points, Victor Oladipo added 16 and the Pacer blew past the Memphis Grizzlies for a 111-83 victory -- the largest opening-night victory margin in the Pacers' NBA era. The previous mark of 27 was set against the then New Jersey Nets in 1985. ""I like our effort,"" McMillan said. ""I thought defensively we were really good, only 16 points in the paint. I thought every guy that went out on the floor played hard. The intensity didn't drop off on the defensive end of the floor. I just really liked our effort and our execution, playing the game together."" It showed. While seven Pacers players scored in double figures, Indiana delivered the knockout blows by excelling in the areas McMillan stressed throughout training camp and the preseason. Memphis shot just 29.8 percent from the field and had only four players in double figures, led by Marc Gasol with 13 points. And Indiana outrebounded the Grizzlies 57-28 including 15 from Domantas Sabonis who also scored 14 points. The Pacers wound up with their best rebounding margin in five years -- and that was all it took on a night the Pacers never trailed despite going 10 of 26 on 3-pointers and committing 20 turnovers. Indiana has won seven of its eight last season openers and eight of its last nine home openers. The Pacers figure it's just a start. ""We've just got to build on it,"" said Oladipo, who was held without a steal for the first time in 64 games. ""It was a great first game, a great first outing, and now we've just got to build on it."" Clearly, it's not what Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff envisioned in his debut as a full-time head coach after twice serving on an interim basis, most recently last season in Memphis. ""We are a much better basketball team than we showed tonight,"" he said. ""We still believe that and we've just got to be better all around."" Indiana jumped to a 26-16 lead after one quarter, then used a 14-2 second-quarter run to make it 41-17. Memphis closed to 56-39 at the half and cut the deficit to 14 twice in the third quarter, but the Pacers fended off the finally charge with 9-3 run to rebuild a 73-53 lead and never let the Grizzlies get closer than 18 the rest of the game. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Rookie Jaren Jackson Jr., who grew up in nearby Carmel, Indiana, scored 10 points in his NBA debut. ... Memphis had only seven turnovers. ... Gasol appeared to hurt his right leg during the second quarter but returned before halftime and played throughout the second half before Bickerstaff pulled his starters late in the game.. Pacers: Indiana has won three straight over the Grizzlies. ... Doug McDermott had 12 points, Cory Joseph finished with 11 and Thaddeus Young wound up with 10 points and eight rebounds. ... TJ Leaf, Indiana's first-round draft pick in 2017, left late in the first quarter with a sprained left ankle and did not return. NO LIMITS All indications are that Mike Conley's recovery from an injured left heel has gone smoothly. After missing 70 games last season, the Indianapolis high school star returned to his hometown and made his first regular-season appearance since November. He played nearly 29 minutes, scored 11 points and had three assists and one steal. And there's no limitation on Conley's playing time. ""We'll be mindful of the amount of minutes he's played over his career,"" Bickerstaff said. ""But he hasn't missed a day of camp, he hasn't missed a rep, so he's ready to go."" NEW SPOT Tyreke Evans' solid debut with his new team came at the expense of his former team. He scored 14 points and had six assists for the Pacers as McMillan tries to determine how best Evans fits in Indiana's rotation. ""He's trying to see what we want him to do and I'm trying to see how we can use him,"" McMillan said. ""It's going to take some time, but I think he's a guy who has some versatility, who can play the one, two or three and we're certainly going to give him the ball and let him create.""","401070695"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Mohamed Bamba made a big impact in his first NBA game. Orlando's 7-foot rookie dunked twice and blocked a shot during a 9-0 fourth quarter run, and the Magic held on for a 104-101 win over the Miami Heat in the season opener for both teams Wednesday night. ""I was so nervous going out there, but it was everything that I expected. It was a fun game to play in,"" said Bamba, who came off the bench for 13 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in 25 minutes. ""It's just a matter of doing that 81 more times."" Aaron Gordon had 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Magic, who went without a field goal over the final 4 1/2 minutes. Goran Dragic led Miami with 26 points and Josh Richardson added 21. With the Magic leading 86-81 early in the fourth quarter, Bamba swatted away a shot by Richardson, and Terrence Ross got his hands on two more Heat shots during Miami's scoreless stretch of nearly four minutes. Bamba dunked in two Orlando misses, and Jerian Grant hit a jumper to lift the Magic to a 92-81 lead with 7:50 remaining. Richardson, Dragic and backup center Bam Adebayo rallied the Heat in the closing minutes, and after the Magic missed three free throws in the final seconds, Miami had a chance to win. But Richardson dribbled out of bounds before Evan Fournier hit two free throws with 1.6 seconds left for the game's final points. ""If I had a little more space on the baseline, I was going to attack, probably spin and make something happen, but I ran out of real estate,"" Richardson said. ""I've just got to make a better play."" The Heat started well and ended with a rally. But after making 11 of their first 20 shots, they finished the game shooting just 39 percent (38-for-97). ""We had a tough time creating looks the way we wanted to, but you have to credit their defense,"" sad Miami coach Eric Spoelstra. ""They're long, they do a really good job of protecting the paint."" Miami led 28-14 after Richardson's 3-pointer late in the first quarter. A 3-pointer by Nik Vucevich gave Orlando its first lead at 37-36, and the Magic led 54-51 at halftime in spite of Dragic's 16 points and Fournier's 0-for-5 from behind the 3-point line. The Magic's bench (Bamba, Ross, Grant and Jonathon Simmons) contributed 36 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocks. ""Offensively, we were here and there, but the story of the game was the bench,"" said Magic coach Steve Clifford. ""When they went in the game they picked up our defense and we played offense off our defense, which is something you have to do earlier in the year."" FINAL RUN FOR WADE Dwayne Wade entered his 16th and final NBA season at the 8:22 mark of the first quarter and played 26 minutes, finishing with nine points and 11 rebounds. ""I'm not going to play him playoff minutes, or anywhere near that, right now,"" said Spoelstra. ""He knows how to approach an 82-game season even better than I do."" BIG STEPS UP? While declining to predict a number of wins, Clifford said a ""realistic goal"" is to finish among the NBA's top 10 in defense and top 15 in offense in points per possession. Orlando was 21st and 24th, respectively, in those categories last season. TIP-INS Heat: F Justise Winslow (hamstring), G Wayne Ellington (ankle), G Dion Waiters (ankle) and F James Johnson (hernia) did not play and are not expected to play Thursday night. Magic: The Magic made 7-of-25 3-point shots and missed 12 free throws. . ... Orlando is 52-64 all-time against its intrastate rival, but has won 7 of the last 11.","401070696"
"NEW YORK --  The nervous Knicks had missed their first nine shots and just needed somebody to make one to get them started. Turned out to be a fan. And once he made a halfcourt shot, the basket really opened up for Tim Hardaway Jr. and the Knicks. ""I think that might have been the reason we turned the game around,"" coach David Fizdale said. Hardaway scored 31 points, sparking the Knicks during their franchise-record, 49-point second quarter, and New York beat the Atlanta Hawks 126-107 on Wednesday night in their first game under Fizdale. Hardaway had 16 points in the period, when the Knicks matched the Hawks' point total for the entire first half. New York led 72-49 at the break. Trae Young finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists, shooting 5 for 14 in his NBA debut. Taurean Prince scored 21 points for the Hawks, who were overwhelmed in their first game under Lloyd Pierce. ""Definitely some things that we haven't been doing coming from preseason,"" Young said. ""But this is just one game, so I am not too worried."" Four other Knicks scored at least 15 points, including rookie Allonzo Trier, who had such a powerful third-quarter dunk that Fizdale apologized for celebrating too much. Rookie Kevin Knox finished with 10 and was just 4 for 16. Hardaway and the Knicks started slowly, as he had missed his first four shots and the Knicks took a timeout trailing 10-2. During that break, George Holmes of Northport, New York, nailed a halfcourt shot to win $10,000, and suddenly the New Yorkers couldn't miss. ""He made that basket a little bit more bigger for us going out of that timeout and I thank him,"" Hardaway said. Frank Ntilikina made a 3-pointer out of the timeout to get the Knicks started on a 12-0 run and then they really took off in the second quarter. That was especially true of Hardaway, who made his next eight shots against his former team. He fell seven points shy of Patrick Ewing's franchise record for opening night, and perhaps could have gotten closer if he needed to play more of the fourth quarter. Young, the No. 5 pick in the draft and the first player to lead the nation in scoring and assists in the same season as a freshman at Oklahoma, said he felt butterflies Wednesday. He recalled that he shot airballs on his first shot in high school, college and Summer League, saying he wanted to avoid that again. He did, knocking down his first shot as a pro, a runner in the lane late in the first quarter. But he missed his other six shots in the first half and the Hawks were outscored by 19 points in his 17 minutes before halftime. TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce congratulated Hawks radio play-by-play voice Steve Holman for working his 2,500th game, counting playoffs, Wednesday. Holman started his career with the team in March 1989. ... Atlanta plays its first three games on the road before facing Dallas in its home opener next Wednesday. Knicks: The Knicks' record for any quarter is 53 points in the fourth quarter against Seattle on Dec. 26, 1967. ... The Knicks opened at home for the first time since the 2014-15 season. OPENING-NIGHT OLD-TIMER Vince Carter began his 21st season by starting at forward and scoring 12 points. Pierce said the Hawks' research Wednesday found that only Robert Parish was an older opening-night NBA starter than the 41-year-old Carter. He stands out so much on a young Atlanta team that the Hawks' average NBA experience drops from 3.65 years to 2.63 if Carter is excluded. FRIENDS AND FOES Fizdale and Pierce played against each other in college, when Fizdale was a senior at San Diego during Pierce's freshman season for West Coast Conference rival Santa Clara. ""Lloyd caught a lob on my head from Steve Nash once,"" Fizdale recalled. ""I still haven't forgave him for that but we've been friends a long time and this is obviously for both of us a big moment.""","401070697"
"TORONTO -- Kawhi Leonard helped the Toronto Raptors extend their success in season-opening games. Leonard had 24 points and 12 rebounds in his Toronto debut, Kyle Lowry scored 27 points and the Raptors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 116-104 on Wednesday night, extending their streak of opening-night victories to six. ""I felt good,"" Leonard said. ""I'm happy we came out and got a win. I came out of the game healthy, so it's a win-win for me."" Acquired from the Spurs in a July blockbuster that sent four-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio, Leonard was introduced to a thunderous ovation, the final Raptors starter to have his name announced to the capacity crowd of 19,915. ""It was great,"" Leonard said. ""They gave me some more energy."" Leonard played 37 minutes in his first competitive game since January with the Spurs. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was limited to nine games last season because of a quadriceps injury. ""It's fun to watch [him], it's fun to play with [him],"" said guard Danny Green, who was traded to Toronto along with Leonard. ""I'm happy for him, that he's playing again."" Fred VanVleet scored 14 points, Pascal Siakam had 13 and Green 11 as the Raptors gave Nick Nurse a victory in his first game as head coach. ""It's pretty cool,"" Nurse said. ""It's good to get it done. It was a little bit nerve-wracking there toward the end."" Lowry led Toronto with eight assists and shot 5-for-6 from 3-point range. ""Kyle was awesome tonight,"" Nurse said. Toronto is the first team since Miami from 2011 through 2016 to win six straight season openers. Kevin Love scored 21 points and Cedi Osman had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Cavaliers. ""From the jump, our execution wasn't there,"" Love said. Cleveland knocked Toronto out of the playoffs in each of the past three seasons, but faces a struggle this season now that former star LeBron James is with the Los Angeles Lakers. Jordan Clarkson and George Hill each scored 15 points and Rodney Hood had 12 for the Cavaliers, who trailed by as many as 20. Cleveland had won 15 of the previous 17 meetings between the teams, including 10 straight postseason games. ""We didn't play well but they had something to do with that,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said of Toronto. ""This is going to be a top team in the East, a top 1- or 2-seed."" Leonard missed his first three shot attempts but made three of his next four to score a team-high six points in the opening quarter. Lowry and Siakam each scored five in the first as Toronto led 28-25 after one. Leonard added six more points in the second quarter and Lowry had five as Toronto made five of 10 from 3-point range to open a 60-47 lead at halftime. Lowry and Leonard each scored nine points in the third, with Lowry making three from long range, as Toronto took a 90-75 lead into the fourth. QUOTABLE A Raptors assistant the past five seasons, Nurse cracked a joke when asked before the game about his journey to becoming a head coach. ""For five years, I had a thousand people telling me I was going to be a head coach in the NBA, and when I got the job those same thousand people were shocked,"" Nurse said. ROUGH STARTS Cleveland is 15-34 all time in its first game of the season, including 6-19 on the road. TIP-INS Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. (right ankle) and G JR Smith (right elbow) were inactive. ... Love shot 5-for-18 from the field and went 10-for-14 at the free throw line. ...

"Jimmy Butler says he's going to figure out how to win while on the Timberwolves, and nothing else matters on the court besides competing. (1:09) SAN ANTONIO --  DeMar DeRozan responded to a trade he didn't want with his usual boundless energy and fearless style in the fourth quarter for San Antonio. Jimmy Butler hasn't received a trade he's requested, and turned in a similar performance for Minnesota. DeRozan had 28 points in his San Antonio debut, LaMarcus Aldridge added 21 points and 19 rebounds and the Spurs overcame a 23-point performance by Butler in a 112-108 victory over the Timberwolves on Wednesday night in a matchup of teams coming off a tumultuous offseason. ""It was an extremely long summer for me, extremely long summer,"" DeRozan said. ""So, just to be in this moment, it feels good."" DeRozan was acquired from Toronto after the Spurs responded to Kawhi Leonard's trade demands by dealing their star forward and Danny Green for the Raptors' All-Star guard and Jakob Poeltl. The trade shocked DeRozan, but he has since warmed to the Spurs and San Antonio. Minnesota is facing a similar trade demand from Butler, who has opted to play through it. Butler, who has told Minnesota that he will not re-sign with the team in the offseason, added seven rebounds and three assists in an active 31 minutes. ""I've got 81 games, baby, that's all the matters,"" Butler said when asked if he expects to remain with Minnesota. ""We've got to lock in on today, what tomorrow brings and see where we are at. If that (trade) comes to be, that comes to be, there's nothing I can do about that. But in the meantime, I've got to figure out a way to help us win some games."" DeRozan was initially upset he was traded, but has since embraced San Antonio and those good vibrations propelled him in the fourth. DeRozan banked in the eventual game-winning shot in the final minute against Butler, driving hard to the basket against the 6-foot-8 forward and then pulling up from 12 feet to give San Antonio a 110-108 lead with 32.4 seconds remaining. DeRozan sealed the victory with a pair of free throws with 7.8 seconds remaining after Minnesota's Derrick Rose missed a runner in lane. ""Hey, I've been doing it for some years now,"" the 29-year-old DeRozan said about the late heroics. ""I just feel out the game, always try to be aggressive and at the end moments, I always want to be there. I'm not afraid to make mistakes, but with that I'm not afraid to try to go out there and win the game."" DeRozan's debut was also the close of the Big Three era in San Antonio. Tony Parker left the Spurs to sign with Charlotte in the offseason and Manu Ginobili joined Tim Duncan in retirement. DeRozan and Aldridge are now the cornerstones of the team, and each lauded the other in their debut. ""I haven't played with a guy as dynamic as him since probably Chris Bosh in my rookie year,"" DeRozan said. Aldridge shot 7 for 23 from the field, and had three blocked shots and 11 defensive rebounds. ""He's a great passer,"" Aldridge said of DeRozan. ""He's always looking and probing and I'm too open. I have to get used to being ready and just taking my time. When I figure it out (and) I get my rhythm back, it's going to be way easier out there to score having him."" Rudy Gay had 18 points and Bryn Forbes had 11 points in his first start at point guard for the Spurs. Jeff Teague scored 27 points and Andrew Wiggins added 20 points for the Timberwolves. Karl-Anthony Towns picked up his third foul with 2 minutes left in the first half and fouled out with 4:18 remaining in the game and the Spurs up 99-92. Towns finished with eight points and nine rebounds in 22 minutes. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Teague was down on the court for about 10 seconds in the fourth quarter after tweaking his right ankle on an offensive foul, but gave officials a thumbs-up and remained in the game. ... Minnesota is 3-10 all-time when opening the season on the road. ... The Timberwolves are 9-50 against the Spurs in San Antonio. Their last win in San Antonio was April 17, 2013. Spurs: San Antonio had eight new players on its roster for the season opener for the first time since 1992. The Spurs finished 42-33 that season after firing Jerry Tarkanian 20 games into the campaign. ... DeRozan has played 23,000 minutes in his career, joining Aldridge, LeBron James, James Harden and Russell Westbrook as the only players to do so since 2009. ... Poeltl made just his fifth career start and first since Feb. 14 2017 with Toronto. PAYING HOMAGE TO ALLEN The Spurs observed a moment of silence prior to the game for Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen. Allen passed away Oct. 15 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Aldridge, who played his first nine seasons in Portland before signing with the Spurs in 2015, said it will be difficult to return to the city after Allen's passing. ""He was a great guy and he blessed me and my family and invited us into his world at times,"" Aldridge said. ""I went to the game against Green Bay in his suite. It's definitely bittersweet going back this time."" JERSEY NEEDED DeRozan has been taken aback by the love the Spurs fans have shown him. ""It's crazy, I tried to get my mom a jersey last week and it was sold out,"" DeRozan said. ""I was trying to tell her that and she didn't believe me."" ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE Popovich was asked if this could be his final year coaching in the NBA and he responded with his usual dry wit. ""Anything can happen. I might coach 10 more years or quit in a month,"" he said.","401070699"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Donovan Mitchell wasn't happy with Utah's sporadic defense and neither was coach Quin Snyder. Good thing the Jazz had plenty of scoring options to make up for it. Mitchell scored 11 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and Utah overcame an uneven performance on both ends of the floor to beat the Sacramento Kings 123-117 in the season opener for both teams Wednesday night. ""That whole group that started the game just was flat, and flat defensively,"" Snyder said. ""Against a team that has the level of speed that these guys have, you're playing on your heels and it's hard. As a collective group we just need to be more consistent with our focus defensively throughout the game."" Utah trailed by 16 early in the first quarter, blew a 14-point lead in the third and then pulled away in the fourth. Mitchell, runner-up in Rookie of the Year voting last season, struggled with his shot all night but came up big late. He made a pair of 3-pointers, scored on a driving layup and hit a key free throw with 1:46 remaining. Mitchell shot 8 of 21 and went made only 3 of 10 on 3s. ""You could tell from the tip that they were ready and we didn't do a good job of defending that,"" Mitchell said. ""There was one play where I dunked the ball and I'm jogging back on defense like I did something, and then Justin Jackson gets a 3. Then there was a dead ball and we're all just talking with the ref and they come back down and knock down a 3. Little things like that can't happen."" Rudy Gobert had 19 points and 15 rebounds, Joe Ingles scored 22 and Derrick Favors added 18 points and nine boards as the Jazz won their sixth straight against the Kings. Seven players scored in double figures for Utah. Willie Cauley-Stein had 23 points and seven rebounds for Sacramento. De'Aaron Fox added 21 points and seven assists. ""We played downhill, we played attacking,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We made mistakes. That's what young teams are going to do. But really proud of our team tonight."" Utah beat the Kings by 39 points in a preseason game less than a week earlier but got off to a sloppy start and fell behind 25-9 late in the first quarter. Things turned around quickly for Snyder's team. The Jazz put up 59 points over the next 16 minutes, getting 17 from Ingles, who repeatedly scored from the perimeter after getting freed up on screens. Ingles had 10 points in the second and Mitchell made a layup and 3-pointer to cap a 12-2 run that put the Jazz up 68-55 at halftime. ""We came out a step slow and they wanted it more than us at the beginning of the game,"" Gobert said. ""We had to react."" Utah led 71-57 early in the third before Sacramento went on an 18-2 run. WILLIE'S MOMENT Cauley-Stein's double-double in the season opener was highlighted by a big dunk over Gobert, the 2017 defensive player of the year, in the third quarter that tied the game at 80-all. ""We put the ball to Willie and let him go at him,"" Joerger said. ""He was aggressive and went to his chest most of the night."" ROOKIE DEBUT Marvin Bagley III, the second overall pick in this year's NBA draft, had six points and five rebounds in 12 minutes off the bench for the Kings. His first bucket came on a nifty 11-foot hook shot. ""Preseason kind of helped me so when I got out there it was about playing hard,"" Bagley said. ""Whenever my number is called I have to go hard and do whatever I can."" TIP-INS Jazz: Jae Crowder picked up a technical foul in the third quarter when he shoved the ball into Nemanja Bjelica's chest after getting fouled. ... Utah missed seven of its first nine shots and had five turnovers in the first 5 1/2 minutes. ... Mitchell was 3-of-12 in the first half.

"LOS ANGELES -- A huge reason why the Denver Nuggets missed the playoffs by one game last season was their road record. The Nuggets opened the new season on Wednesday by taking care of business away from home as they rallied in the fourth quarter and defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 107-98. ""That's what mature basketball teams do. When everything's not going well they find ways to win,"" said Paul Millsap, who had 11 points and 16 rebounds. ""We stayed with it, didn't panic and were able to execute down the stretch."" Denver was 46-36 last season but won only 15 games on the road, which is why its postseason drought was extended to five years. It looked like the Nuggets' road woes would catch up with them again. Despite leading most of the game, they trailed 92-84 with 5:14 remaining after the Clippers went on an 11-3 run that was highlighted by a pair of Boban Marjanovic three-point plays. Denver then closed the game by outscoring Los Angeles 23-6. Gary Harris scored six of his 20 points down the stretch while Millsap, who missed his first six shots from the field, hit a jumper with 2:55 remaining to give the Nuggets a 95-94 lead and then was 6 of 8 on foul shots. After a Tobias Harris free throw tied the game at 95, Nikola Jokic gave Denver the lead for good with 1:24 remaining with a putback layup off Jamal Murray's missed jumper. ""We closed out the game well, made some shots and defended well,"" said Jokic, who led the Nuggets with 21 points along with eight rebounds. The Nuggets were 33 of 87 from the field but outrebounded the Clippers by nine (56-47). Los Angeles wasn't much better from the field, going 35 of 87, but it was 8 of 28 on 3-pointers. ""What stood out to me was what I said before the year, which was, `Can we close games?' and tonight we didn't do that,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We had a lead, we had to go offense for defense a little bit. Down the stretch, we really just didn't get good shots."" Tobias Harris had 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Marjanovic added 18 points for the Clippers. Will Barton added 19 points for Denver, with all but six coming in the first half. Denver led 59-54 at the half after scoring the final six points of the second quarter. The Nuggets then extended the lead to 63-54 early in the third quarter before the Clippers slowly whittled it down to two (74-72) at the end of the quarter. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was without Isaiah Thomas (right hip surgery), Jarred Vanderbilt (right foot surgery) and Michael Porter Jr. (lower back surgery). ... Trey Lyles added 10 points. Clippers: Danilo Gallinari had 16 points while Lou Williams added 14. ... Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who was the 11th overall pick in this year's draft, scored 11 points in his NBA debut. HAPPY EXTENSION The win capped off a good day for Denver coach Michael Malone, who received a contract extension after Wednesday's shootaround. The team did not announce the terms of the deal. THUNDEROUS DUNK Marjanovic's dunk and hanging on the rim with 6:55 remaining in the fourth quarter caused a slight delay as the basket needed to be realigned.","401070701"
"WASHINGTON --  Kelly Olynyk certainly wasn't counting on Dwyane Wade to miss. When Wade did, Olynyk was in the perfect spot. Olynyk grabbed the rebound off Wade's errant turnaround jumper and layed in the go-ahead basket with 0.2 seconds left Thursday night, lifting the Miami Heat to a ragged 113-112 victory over the Washington Wizards, who probably could have used sidelined center Dwight Howard's rebounding skills in their season opener. Olynyk was booed every time he touched the ball, on account of a past playoff fracas with the Wizards when he was with the Boston Celtics. He certainly got to enjoy the way this game ended, after Miami trailed by as many as nine points. ""As a rebounder, you got to assume a miss, but I thought he was going to make it, for sure,"" Olynyk said. ""I was surprised I was that open. I kind of just popped loose, and you're kind of just standing right there. Right place, right time."" It was a fitting conclusion to a game in which Miami outrebounded Washington 55-40 overall and a ""Did I read that correctly?!"" 22-7 on the offensive glass, leading to a 27-10 edge in second-chance points. ""That's really where they killed us,"" said John Wall, who led the Wizards with 26 points and nine assists and combined with Bradley Beal to score the hosts' last eight points. ""Anytime you lose by a shot like that at the end ... that's very devastating,"" Wall said. With new starting center Howard still sidelined by a sore backside that kept him out of all of training camp and the preseason, and backup Ian Mahinmi on the bench, Washington's small-ball lineup was unable to prevent Olynyck, a 7-footer, from getting the rebound that settled things. The 6-foot-10 Markieff Morris, normally a power forward, was at center. Morris pointed at himself and 6-9 reserve Jeff Green as the culprits for letting Olynyk into the pain unencumbered. ""That might have been the easiest layup of the game,"" Morris said. Green's take? ""We've got to find a way to grab that rebound,"" he said. ""They outhustled us. That's pretty much it."" And that's even though the Wizards were playing their first game at home, while the Heat were playing on the second night of a back-to-back road trip after losing at Orlando on Wednesday. ""NBA didn't do us no favors at all,"" said Wade, who shot a combined 7 for 24 in Games 1 and 2, ""but we figured out a way to get a win."" TIP-INS Heat: Josh Richardson led Miami with 28 points, Rodney McGruder added 20, and that pair hit consecutive 3s late in the fourth quarter. ... Coach Eric Spoelstra was asked beforehand about Wade, 36, appearing in both ends of the season-opening back-to-back. ""Right now, it's Game 2. He wants to play. We want him to play,"" Spoelstra said. ""And he's in great shape, he feels good, so he's able to go."" ... Derrick Jones Jr. scored 17 points, while Hassan Whiteside had nine points and 10 rebounds. Wizards: Ian Mahnimi started for Howard, but picked up his fourth foul 15 seconds into the third quarter. By quarter's end, four Wizards -- three starters -- each had four personal fouls. Mahinmi ended up playing about 11 1/2 minutes, with three points and one rebound. ... F Kelly Oubre Jr. was the first substitute used by Washington, entering for Otto Porter Jr. midway through the first quarter. WHERE ARE THE 3S? Wizards coach Scott Brooks put an emphasis on pleading with his players to shoot more 3s this season. Didn't work. At least not in Game 1. Washington was only 7 for 26 from beyond the arc. Porter, who was specifically given a green light by Brooks did not attempt a single 3. ""Other than offensive rebounds and missing 3s, I think we should have won the game,"" Wall said. Oh, other than that, Mr. Wall, how was the play? TOLIVER'S DEBUT WNBA All-Star Kristi Toliver made her regular-season debut as an assistant coach on Scott Brooks' staff. ""I love her. Our staff loves her. Our players feel the same way,"" Brooks said. ""She adds value to our program. She's very talented. She loves the game. She's passionate. And she wants to learn.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Charlotte Hornets have owned the Orlando Magic the last three seasons and nobody is more responsible than Kemba Walker. Walker missed his first five shots, didn't score until midway through the second period and finished with 26 points as Charlotte beat Orlando 120-88 on Friday night. It was the Hornets' 12th straight win over the Magic. ""I'm not on the court thinking we want to keep running the streak up against Orlando, that's just not the case,"" Walker said. ""The whole object is to win. I just want to play well and do what I need to do to win the game."" Nicolas Batum and Miles Bridges had 15 points apiece and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 12 for the Hornets, who won for first time this season. Charlotte limited the Magic to just 33.3 percent shooting and 54 points in the first three periods. Terrence Ross came off the bench to lead the Magic with 14 points. Nikola Vucevic and Evan Fournier had 12 points apiece for Orlando, which trailed by 20 at halftime and never got closer than 15 points in the second half. ""To be consistent, you've got to have a way to play and play that way every night and that wasn't at all the case,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""At halftime, I thought we had a great chance to win the game. Twenty is not a big number in this league, but then Kemba got going in the third and that was it."" Walker helped Charlotte overcome a dreadful first half of offense by hitting a pair of 3-pointers and assisting Marvin Williams on two more 3-pointers at the start of the third period as the Hornets pushed their lead to as many as 31 points in the third quarter. The subs for both sides took over at that point, but nothing changed. The first half was forgettable for both teams. Each struggled to make shots and that poor shooting was magnified by 18 turnovers between them. Orlando was slightly worse in both areas with 28.6% shooting and 12 turnovers that allowed Charlotte to build a 51-31 lead by halftime. Walker, who was scoreless in the first quarter, had 14 points in the second, and led an 18-5 run by the Hornets in the final six minutes of the half. TIP-INS HORNETS: Charlotte has won 14 of its last 15 games against the Magic. ... The Hornets shot just 30.4 percent and committed four turnovers in the first period and still led 22-10. MAGIC: C Nikola Vucevic, who didn't have a block in the season opener, had four against Charlotte. ... SG Evan Fournier was shot 0 for 7 in the first half. ... Orlando missed its first 10 3-point attempts and was 6 for 31 (19.4 percent) for the game. SLOW DOWN FOLKS One game into the season, Magic coach Steve Clifford already is hearing questions about when first-round pick Mohamed Bamba is going to replace seven-year veteran Nikola Vucevic in the starting lineup. ""I don't know why we would even have a conversation like that,"" Clifford said. ""Mo is going to be out there playing quality minutes, but he's not ready physically to play starters' minutes. ""Plus, Nik is like a top 10 or 12 starting center in this league. He might be our best offensive player. We get shots strictly by the space he creates on the floor."" LOOKING BACK Hornets coach James Borrego's first NBA coaching gig was in Orlando, where he replaced Jacque Vaughn in the middle of 2014-15 season. Borrego went 6-6 in his first 12 games as the interim coach, but just 4-14 the rest of the way for a 10-20 record. ""I think it laid the foundation for me to be standing here today,"" Borrego said. ""Being thrown into the fire, not knowing what to expect, you've just got to go for it. It gave me the confidence that yeah, you're ready for this.""","401070703"
"NEW YORK --  Caris LeVert had the ball in his hands in the final seconds and the chance to give his team the lead. Two nights earlier, he fumbled it away. He made the most of his second chance Friday. LeVert's driving layup with a second left gave the Brooklyn Nets their first victory of the season, 107-105 over the New York Knicks. LeVert  had a career-high 28 points, surpassing the 27 points he scored Wednesday night in Detroit in a close loss. He made sure they pulled this one out, driving right into the lane and putting up the tiebreaking shot over Tim Hardaway Jr. After the game he said, `Coach, I owed you one,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Nets trailed by one in Detroit when LeVert lost the ball out of bounds with 8.5 seconds left, and they lost by three. But Brooklyn called his number again and he finished up his 15-point final quarter. ""Kenny had a lot of confidence to go back to me tonight and I just wanted to come through,"" LeVert said. D'Angelo Russell and Jarrett Allen each added 15 points for the Nets. They improved to 6-1 in home openers since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. Hardaway and Enes Kanter each scored 29 points for the Knicks, who were trying for just their third 2-0 start in 20 years. Kanter tied it on a three-point play with 15.9 seconds remaining but all they could manage for a final shot after LeVert's basket was a long 3-pointer by Hardaway that wasn't close. Hardaway was disappointed he didn't do more to stop LeVert, his college teammate at Michigan. ""I felt like I could have defended it a lot better. He's been going right the whole entire game so I've just got to know that,"" Hardaway said. The Nets were still without starting forwards Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who just became a father, and DeMarre Carroll, who had right ankle surgery. But they got back Allen Crabbe, their normal starting guard who came off the bench after missing the opener while recovering sprained left ankle. They shot 70 percent in the first quarter and were in control until early in the second half. Then, Kanter and Frank Ntilikina had a couple of baskets apiece in an 11-0 run that wiped out a 10-point deficit and gave the Knicks a 66-65 lead on Hardaway's 3-pointer. New York was ahead 76-74 after three quarters and neither team led by more than six in a back-and-forth final 12 minutes. TIP-INS Knicks: New York's previous 2-0 starts were in 2012-13 and 1999-00. ... G Courtney Lee, sidelined by a neck injury since the preseason, experienced spasms when he picked up his workout level, delaying his season debut. ... G Emmanual Mudiay didn't like the way his sprained right ankle responded when he tried putting more pressure on it and remained out, with coach David Fizdale saying he would be day to day. Nets: Joe Harris' first 3-pointer was his 237th a Net, moving him into 10th place on the franchise's career list. Next up for Harris, in his third season with Brooklyn, is recently retired Richard Jefferson (286), who is now a Nets' analyst for YES Network. ... F Traveon Graham strained his left hamstring in the first half and missed the rest of the game. BOUNCING BACK Knicks rookie Kevin Knox finished with 17 points on 7-for-14 shooting off the bench and was in the game down the stretch. The No. 9 pick in the draft struggled late in preseason to lose what was expected to be a starting spot and shot 4 for 16 on Wednesday in the opener. He said nothing in particular led to his better night. ""I got some wide-open looks the last few games. Today I got some good looks and just the difference is I was making them tonight,"" Knox said. SIZZLING START The Nets made 11 of their first 14 shots from the field. QBS IN THE CROWD Jets quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Josh McCown were at the game.","401070704"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies' newcomers made a fine first impression on the home crowd. Garrett Temple, picked up in a trade from Sacramento, scored 30 points, rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 as the Grizzlies built a first-half lead and coasted to a 131-117 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. ""The energy was more like a spectacle,"" Jackson said of pregame fireworks, dancers and the performance by Memphis rapper Young Dolph in the home opener. He later added: ""It's a blur. I ain't gonna lie. I really can't (remember specifics)."" Temple, obtained in a July trade, missed only one of his 11 shots, making 5 of 6 from 3-point range. While Jackson, the fourth overall pick in last summer's draft, was starry-eyed and giddy with youthful exuberance, Temple, in his ninth NBA season, was more of a steady vet. Particularly after coach J.B. Bickerstaff texted him Thursday night asking for more leadership to help the Grizzlies forget their season-opening 111-83 loss at Indiana on Wednesday. ""That's part of the reason they brought me here, for my leadership and competitive toughness,"" Temple said. "". I just wanted to have a pace offensively and do some things defensively."" Of his offense, he said: ""The rim opened up for me."" Mike Conley finished with 16 points and 11 assists for Memphis. Taurean Prince led the Hawks with 28 points, while Trae Young, the No. 5 overall pick in the draft, added 20 on 7-for-18 shooting. Miles Plumlee and DeAndre' Bembry each added 12 points. ""For sure not happy with the result, but I feel like I'm getting more comfortable out there,"" Young said of his second NBA regular-season game. ""I'm getting more comfortable with my teammates."" The Hawks, considered one of the league's weakest teams, fell way off the pace in the second quarter when the Grizzlies outscored Atlanta 40-28. From there, the Hawks never really threatened and Memphis extended its lead to 25 points in the third quarter. ""When we get down so much, and we have to battle back, we're putting ourselves in bad spots early on,"" Young said. ""It's hard for us to battle back and take the lead and things like that."" Memphis, which shot 29.8 percent in Wednesday's loss at Indiana, reversed that trend against the Hawks. The Grizzlies finished the game connecting on 54 percent of their shots, including 13-for-26 shooting from beyond the arc. The tone was set early as the Memphis offense clicked to a 77-61 lead at the break, the 77 points matching a franchise record for points in any half. ""We didn't start with the intensity that we wanted to start with defensively and the guys know, and they feel it and understand that,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We just have to apply it to the court. But we did get better (Friday night); we've just got to put it together for 48 minutes."" TIP-INS Hawks: F Omari Spellman sat out with a sore left ankle after rolling it in Wednesday night's loss to the Knicks. ... Young's corner 3-pointer came just before the buzzer ending the first quarter, giving him 13 points in the frame. He was outdone by 15 from Prince. ... Prince's 28 points marked the sixth straight game -- spanning two seasons -- that he has scored at least 20 points. Grizzlies: C Marc Gasol was a game-time decision with a sore back.

YOUNG AND OLD The game featured the league's second-youngest player in Jackson Jr., 19 years old, and the oldest in 41-year-old veteran Vince Carter, who started the game for the Hawks.

"Coach Tom Thibodeau says there's an appreciation for hard work, so he's not surprised fans switched from boos to cheers for Jimmy Butler. (0:57) MINNEAPOLIS --  Jimmy Butler's trade request last month instantly turned him from fan favorite to scorned superstar in Minnesota. With some hustle steals and highlight-reel baskets, he quickly had the crowd at the home opener on his side. Butler brushed off some early jeers, scoring 33 points in 36 minutes to lead the Timberwolves past the Cleveland Cavaliers 131-123 on Friday night. ""I knew as soon as I made an effort play, it was going to turn into cheers,"" Butler said. ""I like it, though. Like I told you, `It's OK to boo me. I'm still going to play hard. I'm still going to try to my best to help win games. Boos, cheers, silence, I've got a job to do."" Andrew Wiggins pitched in with 22 points and Anthony Tolliver hit three 3-pointers off the bench to bolster a vintage all-around effort by the four-time All-Star Butler, who has told the team he won't re-sign when his contract expires next summer. Hence the boos, which began when he was introduced during the pregame pageantry. ""That's the NBA. He loves it,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""The important thing is to get the win. With fans, there's going to be an appreciation for a guy who puts forth that type of effort."" Butler made 10 of 12 field goals and 12 of 12 free throws, with seven rebounds, four steals and three assists to help the Timberwolves (1-1) hold off a late charge by Kevin Love and the LeBron James-less Cavaliers. ""As long as he plays well, the tide will change,"" said Taj Gibson, who had 13 points and eight rebounds. Love had 25 points, 19 rebounds and seven assists against his former team, but the Cavaliers (0-2) have a lot of work to do to become a contender again after James bolted for the Los Angeles Lakers. They allowed the Wolves a franchise record for points in a home opener. ""It's going to be a growth year for us. There's going to be a lot of lessons for us,"" Love said. ""If we can just put consistent basketball together, there's going to be a number of teams that we're going to be able to beat and we're going to give the best teams a good run for their money."" With a layup by Collin Sexton at the 4:02 mark, the Cavs were within 121-117, their closest since trailing 36-34 early in the second quarter. Cedi Osman's 3-pointer kept the Cavs within 125-120, but he missed his next one after Jeff Teague failed to convert a layup on the other end. BUTLER DID IT When the news of Butler's trade request broke exactly one month ago, the likelihood of him awkwardly suiting up in the home opener for the team he's seeking to leave was, well, extremely low. Yet here he was, taking the court at Target Center in the home blues with the white trim. The boos came during the first five possessions by the Wolves each time Butler touched the ball, until he stole a pass by Love in the backcourt and fed Gibson for a dunk. The crowd immediately roared, as if the fans forgot who they were upset with because the play happened so fast. The four-time All-Star had plenty more highlight-reel dunks and steals from there. Soon enough, some ""MVP! MVP! MVP!"" chants even broke out. The Wolves enjoyed a 52-23 run over a 13-minute stretch until late in the second quarter, taking a 20-point lead on a three-point play by Wiggins launched when Karl-Anthony Towns blocked a layup attempt by Osman on the other end to start a fast break. ""As long as you know that my mind and my heart is in the right place and that I do everything to win and I'd do anything for my guys, I'm cool,"" Butler said. ALL FOR LOVE Osman had 22 points, Jordan Clarkson added 19 points off the bench and Tristan Thompson totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Cavs, who trailed 83-62 early in the third quarter. Love brought them to life with a 3-pointer that sparked a 24-10 spurt. He had 13 points in the run. ""He made some shots, really commanded the ball in the post, made some good passes,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""That's the Kevin we're used to."" TIP-INS: Cavaliers: Larry Nance Jr. has yet to play this season because of a sprained right ankle, though Lue said he's hoping to have the center back soon. ""It's a big loss,"" Lue said. ""With the team we have, we need everybody."" ... J.R. Smith played four minutes after missing the opener with a sore left elbow. Timberwolves: Wiggins, who was taken with the first overall pick in the 2014 draft by the Cavs only to be traded to the Wolves two months later in the deal for Love, has averaged 27.2 points in nine career games against Cleveland. ... Towns has only 20 points on 6-for-16 shooting in two games.","401070706"
"NEW ORLEANS --  When Anthony Davis wasn't soaring to the rim to slam down alley-oop lobs, Nikola Mirotic was burying a barrage of 3s that had the crowd chanting his name. By the end of the night, the New Orleans Pelicans were getting a standing ovation for their highest single-game point total in franchise history. Mirotic scored 36 points, Anthony Davis had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and the pace-pushing Pelicans continued their torrid start to the season with a 149-129 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. ""We've been just playing fast, sharing the ball, playing very unselfish,"" Mirotic said. ""I think we're going to be big trouble for the rest of the teams."" Jrue Holiday had 15 points and 10 assists for the Pelicans, who shot 58.9 percent (56 of 95) and reached 110 points in the third quarter. ""We could have had more if we made free throws,"" Davis noted, alluding to New Orleans' 21-of-33 effort from the foul line. ""But for the most part, offensively, our team can pretty much put the ball in the basket."" Julius Randle and Ian Clark each scored 13, and Randle also had 13 rebounds for New Orleans, which opened the season with a surprising 131-112 victory at Houston on Wednesday and has scored at least 30 points in each of its first eight quarters, so far. Davis said 30-point periods ""hopefully"" will remain a regular occurrence. ""Our thing is making sure the other team doesn't have 30, but if we can get 30-plus every quarter, more than likely we're going to win those games,"" Davis said. Willie Cauley-Stein scored 20 points and Marvin Bagley III had 19 for Sacramento, which has lost its first two games. De'Aaron Fox and Frank Mason each scored 18 for the Kings, who shot 52.1 percent, but couldn't keep up with the Pelicans, who combined for 35 assists on their 56 baskets and had eight players with 10 or more points. ""I saw some really good things offensively tonight,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""I see, certainly, a lot of things defensively that can be learned through experience that just takes time as younger guys learn how to play against older guys. I am not fired up about giving up 149, but I do like what I see from a lot of our guys.""

The Pelicans are 2-0 for the first time since 2011-12. MIROTIC'S MOMENT Mirotic hit three 3s in quick succession in the middle of the fourth quarter, the third a step-back shot from the right wing, drawing chants of ""Ni-ko! Ni-ko!"" from the crowd. The Montenegro native said he hadn't had a moment like that since he was a 19-year-old in Madrid, scoring in bunches during a EuroLeague game. ""It was really good to remember those days and to happen in the NBA it's kind of even better,"" Mirotic said. ""So I'm just happy. I'm going to go home. I'm going to be with my wife, son and obviously I'm going to watch that game again."" HIGHLIGHT REEL The Pelicans penchant for setting each other up produced some memorable highlights. In the first half, Holiday was dribbling across the lane when he lofted a right-handed lob that looked like a running hook. Davis soared to palm the ball with his right hand and slam it down in one motion. Later, Davis grabbed an offensive rebound as he crashed to the court, and from his back flipped a pass to Holiday, who drove down the lane for a layup.","401070707"

Again, he can be a lot better. I'm sure tonight he's going to go home and think about all they ways he can be better, and for us, that's exciting.""

""Anytime you're not stopping the ball and that ball is getting to the paint, it forces your defense to collapse,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said.

We need to load to him and stop him. Overall, we have just got to do a better job of doing that earlier in the game. You know once he finds his rhythm, he starts finding guys, and guys were hitting shots. It's hard to defend, but we have to control what we can control out there.""

"LOS ANGELES --  These new-look Clippers like each other. With stars Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan cleared out, Los Angeles is looking to compete with a mix of veterans and youngsters who came together to earn their first win of the season. Danilo Gallinari and Tobias Harris scored 26 points each and the Clippers rallied in the fourth quarter for a 108-92 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. ""They just want to win and they're over themselves,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. The Thunder fell to 0-2 without Russell Westbrook, who has a right knee issue. ""He's missed everywhere,"" said guard Raymond Felton, who had 10 points off the bench. Lou Williams, last season's Sixth Man of the Year, added 17 points off the bench.

""When you see the energy and the fans on our side, we were just having fun,"" Gallinari said. Paul George led the Thunder with 20 points before fouling out with 1:13 remaining in the game. He was 7 of 27 from the field in part because of the defense of Avery Bradley and Luc Mbah a Moute. ""They made it a hard night on George,"" Rivers said.

We made them work for those shots in the first half and we felt like if we continued to work like that, that eventually they would break.

RAINING 3s The Nets shot 43.2 percent (16 of 37) from 3-point range and made six 3s in the second quarter to regain the lead briefly when D'Angelo Russell made one to put Brooklyn ahead 56-53 with 4:07 remaining in the first half. The Pacers shot 66.7 percent (16 of 24) from 3 and made five in the fourth quarter to help put the game away.","401070710"
"NEW YORK --  The Celtics could laugh afterward, because none of Jayson Tatum's mistakes cost them. Not the missed dunk with 36 seconds left -- thanks to Tatum rebounding it himself and making a tough jumper -- and not his foolish foul with 1.9 seconds remaining. Tatum did far more good than bad, finishing with 24 points and 14 rebounds as Boston held on to beat the New York Knicks 103-101 on Saturday night. ""I mean, that guy's just super talented,"" Kyrie Irving said. ""To be so young, to be so poised is an awesome trait for him."" The second-year forward showed it with his calm response to his botched dunk with the Celtics clinging to a one-point lead. ""He should've made the dunk,"" Irving said. ""I told him, `I can't dunk it for you, I can only pass you the ball."" Tatum grabbed the rebound and with the clock running down made a tough turnaround jumper for a 101-98 lead with 21 seconds to go. ""I was just trying to make up for it,"" Tatum said. ""I just missed the easy one."" He had then given the Celtics another three-point lead with two free throws with 7.9 seconds left and the Knicks called their final timeout. They had trouble getting the ball inbounded from the sideline, and Knicks guard Trey Burke had to race into the backcourt to retrieve it as the clock ran down. He pulled up for a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc and Tatum jumped to contest it, fouling Burke for three free throws that could have tied it. But he missed the first and the Knicks couldn't grab the rebound when he intentionally missed the third. ""As a point guard, I know I can knock those down in my sleep but tonight I missed the first one. I got to live with that,"" Burke said. ""I feel like I let my teammates down."" Irving and Marcus Morris each added 16 points for the Celtics, who rebounded from their loss in Toronto on Friday night. They won despite giving Gordon Hayward a night off to rest his surgically repaired left ankle. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 24 points for the Knicks, who lost rookie Kevin Knox to a sprained left ankle in the first quarter. Enes Kanter had 17 points and 15 rebounds before fouling out of their second two-point loss in two nights. The Celtics are considered one of the Eastern Conference favorites but coach Brad Stevens said the Raptors were clearly better now and Boston needed to improve after Toronto's 113-101 victory Friday night. On Saturday night, they were just good enough to beat the rebuilding Knicks. The Celtics looked sharp early in racing to a 26-10 lead Saturday and still had a double-digit cushion midway through the second quarter before Damyean Dotson's second straight 3-pointer trimmed it to 50-48 by halftime. TIP-INS Celtics: Aron Baynes got the start with Hayward out and scored 10 points. But he played only 12 minutes before leaving with a sore right hamstring. ... Jaylen Brown was only 2 for 9, finishing with seven points. Knicks: Coach David Fizdale said G Courtney Lee would see specialists Monday after experiencing neck spasms that went down into his chest. Lee was sidelined throughout the preseason by a neck injury. ... Kanter became the first Knick since Zach Randolph (2007-08) to start the season with three straight double-doubles. KNOX KNOCKED OUT Knox was driving for a layup on a fast break when his ankle appeared to roll badly as he was fouled by Terry Rozier III. Knox stayed on the court briefly, appearing in pain, then was carried off by a pair of teammates. Because the No. 9 pick wasn't able to shoot the free throws, he was, by rule, forced to miss the remainder of the game. The Knicks said X-rays on his ankle were negative. HAYWARD'S HEALTH Stevens said there wasn't a plan to rest Hayward on back-to-backs, but his minutes are being watched and he's being evaluated on a game-by-game basis. He said Hayward, who broke his ankle last year in the season opener, was just experiencing general soreness Saturday and didn't think it was anything overly concerning.","401070711"
"PHILADELPHIA --  When Ben Simmons went down with an injury, JJ Redick stepped off the bench and into a starring role for the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Redick scored 31 points, including a 3-pointer with 17 seconds left that lifted the 76ers over the Orlando Magic 116-115. Redick had his best game since transitioning from starter to sixth man for the 76ers at the start of the season, making 10 of 20 shots, including eight 3-pointers. ""JJ Redick was our bell-ringer tonight,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We needed every bit of JJ tonight to find a way of getting out of this building with a win. When Ben goes out, you realize you're going to need help from someplace else. ... We knew JJ was going to have to take up some of that slack."" Aaron Gordon had a chance to tie it with 10 seconds remaining but missed his second free throw, and a last second jumper by Terrance Ross missed the net entirely. Joel Embiid had 32 points and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, including 19 points by halftime. He did it with an outside game in the first half but was more of a force down low after intermission. Yet, Embiid's biggest play was an assist to Redick on the winning shot. It was a play that went awry and resulted in a turnover in the 76ers season-opener against Boston. But the pairing made good against Orlando. ""I was (mad) in Boston because we usually understand each other so well,"" Embiid said. ""But I love playing with him. When it comes to sharing the ball, whether I'm going to set a screen for him or just hand the ball off I know I'm going to be happy with the outcome. The only thing is I wish he was 24 years old so we could play 10 years together, but he's old."" Dario Saric scored 13 points and Robert Covington had 12 as the 76ers improved to 2-1 this season. Evan Fournier had 31 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic added 27 points and Gordon had 20. ""We played better but we should have won the game,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We had two huge defensive mistakes late on plays that we defended the whole game. You can't make those mistakes against a good team on the road. That game was there to be won. There were plays to be made and you got to make them."" Simmons left the game after the first quarter with a tight back, meaning Philadelphia had to lean that much more on Embiid and Redick. With Simmons out, Markelle Fultz was given an opportunity to play extended minutes and run the offense. Fultz finished with eight points on 4-of-11 shooting and added seven assists with only one turnover. However, with the game on the line, 76ers coach Brett Brown opted to use T.J. McConnell at the point and kept Fultz on the bench. High scores have been common in the early part of the NBA season as teams are pushing the pace and trying more shots, especially from deep. Both teams shot lights out from 3-point territory. The Sixers, paced by Redick, shot 17 of 34 (50 percent) while the Magic, led by Fournier's six 3-pointers, shot 16 of 29 (55.2 percent). Thirteen players attempted shots from beyond the arc, eight for Orlando and five for Philadelphia. EMBIID'S OUTSIDE GAME Embiid stretched the Magic defense in the first half, attempting four 3-pointers. He made three of them. Embiid said it was something he worked on a lot over the summer but that he needed to make the shots tonight or he might give up on the concept. SIMMONS INJURY UPDATE Brown said Simmons' back started stiffening up on him before the game, but he decided to give it a go. The decision to pull Simmons was made by trainers. Brown said he didn't thing the injury was serious and the decision was likely more precautionary than anything else. Brown said the team would update Simmons' status Sunday. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando let a 16-point lead slip away in the first half in short order. They led 26-10 with 5:13 to go in the quarter but fell behind for the first time at 11:25 of the second quarter and didn't regain the lead until Ross hit his desperation 3-pointer with 1:24 to play in the game. They were outscored by Philadelphia 23-6 in that 5:48 run. ... The Magic have now lost four straight against Philadelphia. They had won 13 of the previous 17. 76ers: Embiid broke 30 minutes played for the third straight game to start the season. He only did that twice in the first 10 games last season, and not until Nov. 1. McConnell played 25 minutes for the Sixers, more than any bench player besides Redick. He finished with eight points, four rebounds and four assists. Brown admitted that he went with McConnell over Fultz in the fourth quarter because of his experience.","401070712"
"MIAMI --  Kemba Walker got a call, and the Charlotte Hornets got a win. Walker continued his red-hot start by scoring 39 points, including the game-winning free throw with a half-second left, and the Hornets wasted a 26-point second-half lead but still spoiled Dwyane Wade's final home opener by topping the Miami Heat 113-112 on Saturday night. Wade scored with 12.3 seconds left to tie the game, and the Hornets gave the ball to Walker. He drove on Miami's Rodney McGruder, wound up on the ground and got the call from referee Scott Wall -- one the Heat argued to no avail. ""I just saw a little bit of a lane,"" Walker said. ""I thought I did a good job at getting the contact."" Walker made the first free throw, intentionally missed the second and time expired before anyone could contain the rebound. ""This is a game, for sure, you want it to keep going,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who thought McGruder defended Walker perfectly on the deciding play. ""It should have been decided in an overtime, if not more."" Malik Monk scored 15 for Charlotte, and Marvin Williams added 13. Wade led the Heat with 21 points. Goran Dragic scored 20, McGruder finished with 19 and Hassan Whiteside grabbed 15 rebounds for Miami. ""You just want the players to decide the games,"" Wade said. ""Our refs have the toughest job, I feel, of any refs in any sport. But two teams fight like that, you just want the players to decide it. It's tough. Obviously, we all were very angry about it."" Charlotte was 12 for 20 from 3-point range in the first half, fueling its run to the huge lead. The Hornets then went 1 for 12 from beyond the arc in the third quarter, and missed their first three tries from deep in the fourth quarter before Monk rattled one down for a 103-97 lead with about 5 minutes left. But it wasn't over, not by a long shot. Wade made a pair of 3-pointers, then set up Whiteside for a basket that got the Heat within 107-105. Miami kept chipping away, getting within 111-110 on a drive by McGruder with 46 seconds left. After Michael Kidd-Gilchrist made one of two foul shots after getting fouled by Whiteside -- another call the Heat did not like -- Miami had the ball down two with 24.7 seconds left. Wade tried a 3 for the lead and missed badly -- so badly that he knew where the rebound was going. He scooted in, got the board himself and laid it in for a tie with 12.3 seconds left to mark the first and only time that the Hornets didn't lead after halftime. That's when the Hornets gave the ball to Walker for their final play, and he delivered. ""I was really proud of our group,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte had lost six straight against Miami. ... Walker got his 10,000th career point on a drive in the third quarter. ""You're talking about being in an elite class,"" Borrego said of the milestone. ""You've got to work. You've got to get better every single year. You can't relax."" Heat: Miami's three games have been decided by margins of three points, one point and one point, each of them going down to the final second. ... Miami is 9-2 in home openers under Spoelstra. Both losses have come to Charlotte. ... The Heat outrebounded Charlotte 49-40, but saw their 16 turnovers converted into 25 points. SIZZLING WALKER Walker has 19 3-pointers already, the most by any NBA player through his team's first three games of any season. Walker also has 106 points through Charlotte's first three games. That's more than he's ever scored in his first four games of an NBA season -- he had 92 in his first four appearances of the 2016-17 season. ""They're like, `Kemba, keep shooting,"" Walker said of his coaches and teammates. ""That's what I'm going to keep on doing."" ONE LAST DANCE It was the final home opener for Wade, who has dubbed this season ""one last dance."" He and fellow 16-year veteran Udonis Haslem addressed the Miami crowd before the game. ""We want to thank each and every last one of you guys,"" Wade said.","401070713"
"CHICAGO --  Blake Griffin was having a big game and he had just hit a key 3-pointer on his previous attempt. Still, the perennial All-Star had no problem deferring to a reserve for a potential game-winning shot Saturday night. Griffin had 33 points and 12 rebounds, Ish Smith scored all 15 of his points in the second half, including the decisive basket, and the Detroit Pistons beat the Bulls 118-116 in Chicago's home opener. ""Ish is unbelievable,"" Griffin said. ""He just does so many things that are huge for our team. I think the team recognizes that, but I hope everybody else does, too."" Griffin was 12 for 23 from the field, including 5 of 7 on 3-pointers, as Detroit won its second straight to start the season. With the score tied at 116, Smith drove through the defense for a layup with 5.4 seconds left. ""Coach (Dwane Casey) set up a great play and I got two great screens,"" Smith said. Zach LaVine had 33 points on 12-of-22 shooting for Chicago, which dropped its second consecutive game. The Bulls played without starters Kris Dunn (excused absence) and Lauri Markkanen (sprained right elbow), and reserve Denzel Valentine (left ankle). ""I loved his aggressiveness,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said of LaVine. ""I thought he started the game attacking and that's when he's at his best."" Detroit had a 60-58 halftime lead despite shooting 34 percent in the first two quarters. Griffin had 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting. LaVine had 19 first-half points for Chicago. The Pistons led 85-84 entering the fourth before the Bulls scored four straight points. Smith put Detroit back on top 89-88 and the Pistons held a slim advantage until LaVine hit a 3-pointer with 24.6 seconds left. After Smith's basket, Chicago had a chance to tie or go ahead with a 3, but LaVine lost the ball -- he was pressured by Griffin -- as he rose for a 3-pointer. ""It can't happen,"" LaVine said. ""It has to be either a miss or a make, so that's really upsetting to lose that way. We played so good and to have it end like that, it's an emotional roller-coaster. Griffin was asked if he got a hand on the ball. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I'm gonna say yeah for now."" A WIN IS A WIN To make the playoffs this season, the Pistons know they must play well on the road. They consider Saturday a good start. ""A win is a win on the road,"" Casey said. ""That was one of our challenges going into this year -- executing on the road. In the game, we still need to be better, down the stretch we have to do better, and we will."" ROOKIE WOES Bulls C Wendell Carter Jr., the seventh pick in the NBA draft, had eight points and two rebounds in 18 minutes mostly matched up against Detroit's Andre Drummond. It wasn't an overwhelming effort, but Carter has a fan in Griffin. ""I can't speak for him, but I'm sure it's chaos and confusion for him right now,"" Griffin said. ""He doesn't look that way, but that's just how you feel no matter what when you're a rookie. ""But he's so talented that he's going to be fine. It's just a matter of time. I watched him play probably more than any other player in college. I really like his game."" TIP-INS Pistons: F Reggie Bullock (illness) and F Stanley Johnson (toe) returned to the starting lineup after missing the opener against Brooklyn. Bullock finished with 16 points in 24 minutes, while Johnson had 10 points in 30 minutes. Bulls: Valentine will be out for at least another two weeks after a scan on Friday revealed a bone bruise in his left ankle. He'll be re-evaluated in two weeks. ""It's not that bad,"" Valentine said. ""My ankle's feeling better, so it's just time."" ... Dunn missed his second straight game following the birth of his first child. He is expected to rejoin the team Monday in Dallas.","401070714"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic had the home crowd roaring in the teenager's Dallas debut with step-back 3-pointers and big buckets late while fellow youngster Dennis Smith Jr. quietly played a secondary role. The script flipped in the final seconds. Doncic scored 26 points after a rough start in the No. 3 overall pick's first home game, Smith converted a tiebreaking three-point play with six seconds left and the Mavericks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 140-136 in a wild offensive game Saturday night. ""We're going to have ups and downs,"" said center DeAndre Jordan, who had 22 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks in his first game in front of the fans who used to boo him unmercifully after the Texas native backed out on a pledge to join Dallas in free agency three years ago. ""We've got young guys with high character and poise with good basketball IQs. Dennis stuck with it tonight and he ultimately made a play that won us the game."" The Timberwolves didn't seem to miss Jimmy Butler much after letting the disgruntled guard stay home to rest a night after he scored a team-high 33 points in their first win. Minnesota matched the most points Dallas has given up in a first quarter while taking a 46-37 lead. But a 15-point Minnesota lead in the first quarter was gone before halftime in a game with nine lead changes in the second half. And the Mavericks mostly canceled out the Wolves' big first quarter with 43 points in the fourth. A 19-year-old who is the second-youngest ever to play for the Mavericks, Doncic kept Dallas ahead in the closing minutes by twice backing down for baskets over Derrick Rose, who had 28 points in his highest-scoring game since late in the 2016-17 season. After Karl-Anthony Towns hit an off-balance 3 on his way to 31 points to help the Timberwolves get close and Taj Gibson made a jump-hook in the lane to pull them even with 27 seconds left, Smith made Rose the defensive victim again. Smith -- a 20-year-old and the third-youngest to play for the Mavericks after making his debut as a teenager this time last year -- hit a jumper just inside the 3-point line over Rose and drew the foul. The free throw put the Mavericks up 137-134. Smith scored 10 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, including the last six for Dallas. ""We just have to play defense,"" Rose said. ""It seemed like everyone I was covering tonight made a tough shot on me and I just have to do a better job of contesting shots."" Doncic, the No. 3 overall pick and second-youngest to play in a game for the Mavericks, bounced back from a slow start and finished 8 of 16 from the field and 4 of 9 from 3-point range two nights after a fairly rough NBA debut in a loss at Phoenix. With 40-year-old fellow European Dirk Nowitzki watching from the bench in a light blue suit while dealing with an ankle issue, Doncic missed his first three shots and quickly committed two of his game-high six turnovers. But Doncic sparked a flurry of 15 points in the final 6:41 of the second quarter with a floater that drew a foul, although he missed the free throw. He poked away a loose ball and hit a second straight 3-pointer to give the Mavericks their first tie at 54-all. The Mavericks took their first lead at 62-61 in the second quarter on Jordan's layup on an alley-oop pass from J.J. Barea, who finished with 11 assists. TEXAS TWO-STEP The Timberwolves had to make two trips to Texas in a three-day span, part of the reason for sitting Butler so early. They opened with a loss at San Antonio before beating Cleveland on Friday night. ""It was a tough turnaround for us,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You get in late and you have to come with energy. I liked the energy to start the game."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: The Timberwolves shot 63 percent while building their first-quarter lead. ... Jeff Teague had 22 points and a team-high nine assists. ... Andrew Wiggins scored 19 before fouling out in the final seconds. Mavericks: Harrison Barnes (right hamstring strain) and Devin Harris (left hamstring strain) joined Nowitzki on the sidelines. ... The Mavericks set a franchise record with 50 3-point attempts, making 17 (34 percent). ... Wesley Matthews and Dwight Powell scored 19 points apiece. Barea had 12. ...

"DENVER --  On a historic night in which he was serenaded with ""MVP!"" chants for his eye-popping triple-double, Nikola Jokic's thoughts were with the Denver Nuggets' injured tone-setter. Forward Will Barton will go for an MRI on Sunday morning after injuring his right hip on a reverse layup in the third quarter of Denver's 119-91 win over the Phoenix Suns on Saturday night. ""We're going to miss him -- a lot,"" Jokic said. ""Not just on the court, just vocally. He's a guy who can speak with everybody, with the coach, he can say whatever. He doesn't have that `hair on the tongue' is how we call it in Serbia. ""Hopefully he can be back soon."" Paul Millsap called Barton ""the voice of this locker room."" ""He's the one that's talking before games, he's the one that's bringing us together,"" Millsap said. ""It's going to be tough to lose that, if we have to. But hopefully, we're going to pray everything's OK and he's back with us soon."" Barton, who had 14 points in 19 minutes before being wheeled off, said he felt something pop when he took off for the basket and was still sore, but in much less pain, after the game. ""I'll just wait for the MRI,"" Barton said. ""I don't want to predict anything or get to high or too low, just once I find out, take it from there."" Jokic, who had 11 assists and 12 rebounds, joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to post a triple-double with 30 or more points without missing a field goal. Chamberlain did it twice, in 1966 and `67. ""He had one of those nights tonight,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He missed one shot tonight, from the foul line. And anytime you're mentioned in company with Wilt Chamberlain, you're doing something right."" Jokic made all 11 of his shots from the floor and missed just one of 11 free throws on a night the crowd serenaded him with chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" ""Individually and collectively we got spanked in every aspect of the game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Jokic had a monster game."" Jokic also had four steals, zero turnovers and a blocked shot. ""It was a perfect night for him,"" Jamal Murray said. ""He hit every shot today, no turnovers, triple-double. So, it couldn't get any better."" Save for the one missed free throw. CO-STARS Murray added 26 points as Denver's starters outscored Phoenix's 107-58. The Nuggets are off to their first 2-0 start since 2011-12 and will go for their first 3-0 start since 2009-10 when they host the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors on Sunday night. NO MATCH Devin Booker's 25 points led the Suns, who were hoping for another stellar game from top overall draft pick Deandre Ayton, who had 18 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his po debut against Dallas. But Jokic dominated from the start and Ayton never got going, finishing with 5 points on 2-of-7 shooting. ""It was a learning lesson for me,"" Ayton said of his matchup with Jokic. ""In time I'm going to be doing the same thing."" Millsap said Jokic's play was inspiring on both ends of the court. ""It's great. We all eat off him. He feeds us all (when) the offense is clicking,"" Millsap said. ""But most importantly, the job he did on the defensive end was important for us."" TIP-INS: Suns: Phoenix was without G Troy Daniels, who sustained a concussion at practice. ""It was a contact practice, guys were scrimmaging and it happened right in front of me,"" Kokoskov said. ""It didn't look that hard but he didn't pass the test."" Nuggets: Denver was 31-10 at home last season, fourth-best in the NBA. ... Murray tried to get too fancy on a steal and layup and was stripped when he tried to go behind his back before scoring. ... Torey Craig's defensive versatility will be called upon if Barton misses much time.","401070716"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard had 29 points while CJ McCollum added 24 and Portland Trail Blazers downed the San Antonio Spurs 121-108 on Saturday night. Jusuf Nurkic added 12 points for the Blazers, who have opened the season with a pair of home wins. They led the Spurs by as many as 20 points in the fourth quarter after a close first half. DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and nine rebounds in a second strong performance after coming to the Spurs in an offseason trade. DeRozan had 28 points in his San Antonio debut Wednesday in a 112-108 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was traded from Toronto in July along with Jakob Poeltl in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.  DeRozan wasn't happy about the deal, especially in light of his close friendship with Toronto teammate Kyle Lowry, but he appears to have developed a nice chemistry with his new team. His arrival also signaled the end of the Big Three era in San Antonio. Tony Parker left the Spurs to sign with Charlotte in the offseason and Manu Ginobili joined Tim Duncan in retirement. The Blazers opened the season with a 128-119 victory over the Lakers, spoiling LeBron James' debut with the team. Lillard had 28 points and Nik Stauskas came off the bench to score 24 for Portland, which won its 18th straight home opener to extend an NBA record. Portland's season has started on a somber note following the death of owner Paul Allen. The enigmatic co-founder of Microsoft died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was 65. Lillard's first basket was a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc. The Spurs pulled ahead 29-28 on Bryn Forbes' 3-pointer in the opening half, but Meyers Leonard put Portland back in front with an alley-oop dunk from Evan Turner. Portland extended its lead to 47-38 on Al-Farouq Aminu's 3-pointer. The Blazers led 59-50 at the break, led by Lillard with 14 points. DeRozan had 15 for the Spurs. McCollum's 3-pointer put the Blazers up 73-60, their biggest lead of the game to that point. The team stretched the lead to as many as 18 points in the 38-point quarter. The Blazers shot 53.6 percent from the floor for the game. The Spurs shot 42 percent. TIP INS Spurs: The two teams will meet four total times this season. The Spurs won last season's series 2-1. ... Chimezie Metu made his NBA debut. Metu was selected by the Spurs in the second round of the NBA Draft this past summer, after three seasons at USC. Trail Blazers: Stauskas, acquired by the Blazers as a free agent in the offseason, grabbed the attention of fans with his performance in the opener and was treated with cheers when he came off the bench in the second quarter. ... Lillard finished with nine assists.","401070717"
"CLEVELAND -- Trae Young got doused with a bucket of ice water after his third NBA game. The Cavaliers couldn't do anything to cool off Atlanta's rookie guard. Young scored 35 points with 11 assists -- the best line by a first-year player since Steph Curry in 2010 -- and Kent Bazemore scored 23 on Sunday as the Hawks rolled to an easy 133-111 win over Cleveland, which lost its home opener and fell to 0-3 as it readjusts to life without LeBron James. The No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft, Young shook off a slow start and showed why the Hawks believe he's a future superstar. Afterward, Young was targeted by teammates after they soaked coach Lloyd Pierce following his first win. ""It was super cold,'' Young said with a smile after his shocking bath. ""I thought it would just be Coach Pierce because he had his first win, but it was all right. I'll take it.'' Young was unaware that he matched Curry, who twice scored at least 35 with 10 assists in his first season with Golden State. Just three games into the season, Young has 79 more chances to do it again. ""Now that we know what he's capable of, we'll be expecting a little bit more,'' Bazemore joked. The Hawks made a team-record 22 3-pointers, including 10 while scoring 41 in the fourth quarter, to blow open the game and send Cleveland fans home early, with many shaking their heads on the way out. Jordan Clarkson scored 19, and Kevin Love had 16 with 17 rebounds for the Cavs, who could be in for a very long season post-LeBron. Cleveland's issues appear to be far deeper than no longer having the game's best player. The Cavs aren't playing professional-level defense and have given up 116, 131 and 133 points in their first three games. ""We didn't expect to be 0-3,'' said Love, who was asked if he was alarmed by the performance. ""On opening night at home, we expect to play better in front of our own fans. I don't know if alarming is the right word, but it sure seems right, right now. Our effort level just wasn't there. It's just going to be a growth year for us. We've got to get better.'' While wearing neon green sneakers, Young showed plenty of flash in his game. He made six of seven shots and scored 18 in the second quarter, helping the Hawks erase a 14-point deficit and go up 64-60 at halftime. ""Trae is fearless,'' Bazemore said. ""Even in the practices earlier in the summer, he came in and established himself right away. That's what you have to respect: a young guy that comes in, he's not bashful, he's not shy and who has that kind of caliber talent. He's going to have ups and downs. I'm proud of him as a teammate.'' It's a whole new ballgame in Cleveland without James, who carried the Cavs to four straight NBA Finals and a title in 2016 before leaving as a free agent -- for the second time -- in July for Los Angeles. The Cavs are starting over, but believe they can still be competitive in the Eastern Conference. They're pinning most of that hope on Love, who signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension this summer. But he doesn't have much help, and it could be a while before Sexton is ready to contribute. Sexton came off the bench and scored four points on 2-of-11 shooting in 28 minutes. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue thought his young guard might have gotten caught up in his matchup with Young. ""He took it personal,'' Lue said. ""He was flying over screens to get there, and that's not what we wanted to do.'' TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta had 32 assists on 48 field goals. ... Atlanta has 10 players with two years or less NBA experience. The Hawks' roster currently averages 3.64 years, a number that drops to 2.63 with the exclusion of Vince Carter, a 20-year veteran. Cavaliers: Sexton was called for a Flagrant 1 foul in the second quarter for stepping under Bazemore, who was attempting a 3-pointer. ... Love went 6-of-19 and is 17-of-56 in three games. MARQUEE MATCHUP Young didn't take any satisfaction in beating Sexton. ""You look forward to playing anybody in your class,'' he said. ""Playing against him throughout high school, USA Basketball, things like that. You look forward to playing against guys you grew up with. I was looking to playing against Collin, but at the same time, I look forward to playing against everybody.'' WELCOME BACK Pierce was on familiar turf. He began his coaching career in Cleveland, hired by Mike Brown in 2007. Pierce has former Cavs assistants Melvin Hunt and Chris Jent on his staff. ""It's somewhat surreal when you think about it, starting here 12 years ago,'' Pierce said. ""We spent many days and afternoons here at the Q. A lot of credit to Mike and the opportunity he gave all of us.''","401070718"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook was in no mood to talk after his season debut. Iman Shumpert scored 26 points and the Sacramento Kings beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 131-120 on Sunday night to spoil Westbrook's return. Westbrook missed the preseason and the first two regular-season games after having a procedure to deal with inflammation in his right knee. He had 32 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in 35 minutes after averaging a triple-double the past two seasons. Westbrook sat at his locker for more than 20 minutes before getting in the shower and finally addressed the media about an hour after the game ended. ""I was OK,"" he said. ""It wasn't my best night, but I've got however many more games left to play, so I'm not worried. It was my first time. I just hate losing. Honestly, I don't really care to talk about how I played."" Thunder coach Billy Donovan liked what he saw from Westbrook, who made 13 of 23 field goals and was his usual unstoppable self when attacking the rim. ""I thought Russell really played well,"" Donovan said. ""I give him a lot of credit. He worked really hard the last five to six weeks to try to get himself ready. For him to come back, being out as long as he was and play like he did -- I thought we were faster, I thought we got downhill more, I thought the ball was moving."" De'Aaron Fox scored 22 points and Buddy Hield added 17 for the Kings. They shot 54.9 percent to earn their first win of the season. Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said it was a big win for his team, given the buildup for Oklahoma City. ""They come back from the West Coast, they get their guy back and opening night, and a lot going on,"" Joerger said. ""I've got a lot of respect for them. We got the ball up and down the floor and we played fast."" Paul George scored 29 points and Steven Adams added 10 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder. Sacramento led 68-56 at halftime behind 54.5 percent shooting. Westbrook had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists at the break. The Kings pushed their lead to 17 in the third quarter, but the Thunder rallied. A driving dunk by rookie Hamidou Diallo cut Sacramento's lead to 10 and helped bring the crowd back into the game. Oklahoma City closed the quarter strong, but Sacramento still led 97-90 entering the fourth. The Thunder cut the deficit to five in the fourth quarter, but Sacramento held on. Hield hit a 3-pointer with just over 2 minutes remaining to slow Oklahoma City's momentum. TIP-INS Kings: Shumpert scored 16 points in the first quarter and helped the Kings shoot 60 percent in the period. ... Marvin Bagley III, a rookie from Duke, finished with 13 points and seven rebounds. He scored 19 points in his previous game against New Orleans. Thunder: Westbrook scored 11 points in the first quarter. ... George, Adams and backup center Nerlens Noel each committed three fouls in the first half. George committed his fifth foul late in the third quarter. ... The Thunder made just 19 of 30 free throws. HOME SWEET HOME Hield, who played his college ball at Oklahoma, got a warm ovation during pregame introductions. ""It's cool,"" he said. ""Like I said, it's my second home. I was here for four years. Glad to be here. The fans always embrace me well."" SHOTS APLENTY The Thunder took 104 shots, but made just 44.2 percent of them. Oklahoma City's stars, Westbrook and George, made 23 of 41 shots. The rest of the Thunder made 23 of 63. The Thunder had 18 offensive rebounds, which helped them take 13 more shots than the Kings. STRUGGLING SCHRODER Dennis Schroder, the new Thunder player who replaced Westbrook in the starting lineup the first two games, took his share of the blame for the rough start. He made just 5 of 16 shots against the Kings and has made 14 of 50 shots this season. ""We've got to figure it out,"" Schroder said. ""I think the last couple of games, we didn't do a good job of selecting the shots and I take that on me the first two games. I've got to be better and got to make my shots as well, but as a unit, we've got to be better and take better shots. We've just got to get used to it and figure each other out.""","401070719"
"DENVER --  Juancho Hernangomez's swooping right-handed swat was precisely the right stuff to help the Denver Nuggets stay unbeaten. Turns out, this high-scoring Nuggets team can play a little defense, too. Hernangomez blocked a tying layup from behind just before the buzzer and the Nuggets held off the Golden State Warriors 100-98 on Sunday night. Trailing by 13 points in the fourth quarter, the Warriors rallied and had a chance to tie it in the closing seconds. Stephen Curry drove down the lane and passed to big man Damian Jones, who had his shot rejected by Hernangomez. ""Huge,"" said Gary Harris, who finished with 28 points. The Nuggets improved to 3-0 despite missing 18 free throws, including six in the final quarter. The 3-0 start is Denver's best since the 2009-10 squad led by Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups began 5-0. This victory was driven by defense. Denver was sluggish on the offensive end in the second game of a back-to-back but turned up the defensive intensity. The Nuggets forced 18 turnovers. Denver has held all three teams it's faced under 100 points. ""If we defend, we can pretty much outscore everyone in this league. Defense is really our main focus this year,"" Nuggets forward Torrey Craig said. That's music to coach Michael Malone's ears. ""This is how I envision us playing. Some people may call it ugly, but a win is a win, especially against that team -- the reigning champs,"" Malone said. ""If we continue to defend at the level we're defending at and we get our offensive rhythm going, I think we could be a really good team."" Nikola Jokic had 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assist in his bid for a triple-double on a second straight night. No surprise, Curry hit three straight 3-pointers in a 1:11 span to lead the comeback. He finished with 30 points and had six 3-pointers to move him past Paul Pierce for sixth place on the NBA's career list. Draymond Green had a chance to tie the game at 99-all with 9.6 seconds remaining, but his second free throw rolled out. Jamal Murray made one of two free throws on the other end to make it 100-98 and set the stage for Hernangomez, who was engulfed by teammates soon after his swat. ""That was a great play by, um, Juancho, right? It was a great block by him,"" Kevin Durant said. ""You've got to give him credit. Steph made a huge play, dropped it off. Can't ask for anything better."" Asked if he thought about pulling up for a 3-pointer, Curry responded: ""No. I didn't think about it this time. I was going downhill when I crossed court and I saw the lane wide open and realized what the score was. I liked our chances from there, but it didn't work out that way."" Durant showed off his true colors -- wearing a yellow shoe on his right foot to go with a gold, white and hint of blue one on his left. He finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Murray briefly left in the third quarter with what appeared to be a left leg ailment. The team was already missing versatile forward Will Barton, who was carted off the court Saturday with a right hip injury. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston sat out with a bruised left knee. ""We need to have him ready for the long haul so night's like this if he's banged up we'll rest him,"" coach Steve Kerr explained. ... Durant was given a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing a call. Nuggets: The Nuggets are 21-7 at home against the Warriors since 2003-04. BARTON UPDATE Barton underwent an MRI on Sunday morning and Malone said the team will have a clearer idea how long me may be sidelined Monday. ""Hopefully we'll get some good news,"" Malone said. With Barton sidelined, the Nuggets went with a rotation of Craig, Hernangomez and Trey Lyles. They combined for 19 points. SHOOTING WOES Through three games, the Warriors are 24 of 74 from 3-point range. Curry has 16 of the made shots. ""We're just not executing,"" Green said.","401070720"
"BOSTON -- The way things went on the road for the Orlando Magic last season, one of the final two 3-point attempts by Boston probably would have gone in. But it's a new season and the ball bounced the right way in the closing seconds for Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 12 rebounds and the Magic survived two 3-point attempts by Boston in the final seconds to beat the Celtics 93-90 on Monday night. ""We definitely held our breath,'' Vucevic said of the second 3-point attempt. ""Once it hit the rim and I looked at the clock, it was almost over and I was like, 'All right, we're good.''' Jonathan Isaac added 18 points and 12 boards for the Magic (2-2), who went just 8-33 on the road last season, losing 25 of their final 28. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics (2-2) with 22 points. Al Horford had 15 and Gordon Hayward 11. Irving and Hayward each missed a 3 in the final seconds. ""It had a chance for sure,'' Hayward said. ""It was a good look. Kind of the story of the night, we had a bunch of good looks and just didn't knock them down.'' The Celtics, who never led in the game, trailed by at least five points from the midway point of the final quarter until Jaylen Brown nailed a 3-pointer from the left corner, closing it to 89-86 with 71 seconds left. But Isaac answered with a foul-line jumper on the next possession. Horford and Irving then had consecutive baskets 32 seconds apart, slicing it to 91-90 with 14.2 seconds to play. With Boston forced to foul Evan Fournier after Orlando inbounded the ball after a timeout, he stepped to the line and made both free throws with 7.8 seconds left. Irving then missed his 3 from the right corner, and after Horford grabbed the rebound and fed it out -- Hayward's rimmed out just before the buzzer sounded. ""I was beating myself up that Horford got that rebound,'' Isaac said. ""I was trying my best to box him out. I was like 'No don't let them end the game like this or don't let them come back.''' Orlando had pulled ahead by 13 points twice late in the third quarter before Boston closed the period by scoring 10 of the final 12 points to slice it to 75-70 at the break. SEATED COURTSIDE Red Sox star Mookie Betts walked into the arena early in the second quarter and watched from a courtside seat across from Boston's bench. Later in the quarter, the Celtics moved him to a seat right next to their bench. GETTING STARTED Robert Williams, the Celtics' first-round pick in this year's NBA draft, made his debut, playing 3 minutes in the third quarter without getting anything on his stat line. LONG MISSES Both teams were ice-cold from beyond the arc. The Celtics missed 31 of 40 and the Magic 25 of 35. ""Sometimes when you don't make it early, you can feel the tension,'' Boston coach Brad Stevens said. TIP-INS Magic: C Timofey Mozgov was inactive for the fourth consecutive game with a sore right knee. ... Vucevic was 11-of-18 from the floor and Isaac 8-of-12.

"TORONTO --  A tough Toronto Raptors defense took the sting out of Charlotte's 3-point shooting. Kawhi Leonard scored 22 points, Kyle Lowry had 16 points and a season-high 14 assists, and Toronto never trailed in a 127-106 victory over the Hornets on Monday night, the Raptors' fourth straight win to open the season. ""It was a high-scoring, free-shooting team coming in here,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We asked them to get out and contest and disrupt some of their rhythm stuff and we did a pretty good job of that."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 17 points, Danny Green had 16, and Serge Ibaka added 15 as the Raptors won their fifth straight over the Hornets. The Raptors have won nine of the past 11 meetings. ""We just were not sharp enough or physical enough defensively,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. Toronto is the first NBA team to reach four wins. Denver (3-0) can match the Raptors when it hosts Sacramento on Tuesday. The Hornets entered having made an NBA-best 49 3-pointers through their first three games, but struggled from long range against the Raptors. Charlotte finished 9 for 28 from beyond the arc. ""You've got to give those guys a lot of credit, they played great defense,"" Hornets guard Kemba Walker. ""But at the same time, I thought we got some pretty good looks. They just didn't drop."" Charlotte went 0 for 5 from 3-point range in the opening quarter, the first time in any quarter this season they've failed to make at least one basket from long range. ""We had some good looks early that didn't go,"" Borrego said. ""Had those dropped early, we might have had a different outcome in the first half at least."" The Raptors, meanwhile, made a season-best 15 3-pointers. Toronto's 39 attempts was the most in a game, so far. Leonard returned after sitting out Saturday night's road win over Washington, the second game of a back-to-back. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was limited to nine games last season because of a quadriceps injury. ""He's still not back to where he was, but there are glimpses,"" said guard Danny Green, Leonard's former teammate with San Antonio. Leonard was not available to speak to reporters following the game because he was working out. Walker scored 26 points and Jeremy Lamb had 16 as the Hornets suffered their first road loss of the season. Charlotte won at Orlando on Friday and beat Miami on Saturday. ""I thought we could have been better, but that's a great team,"" Walker said. ""They played well together."" Nicolas Batum scored 13 points, Willy Hernangomez had 11 and Malik Monk added 10 for the Hornets. Before the game, Walker was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging NBA-bests of 35.3 points and 6.3 3-pointers. Walker's 19 3-pointers through the first three games set an NBA record. ""It's a credit to his work ethic, who he is as a person, a competitive spirit he has,"" Borrego said. ""We're in a good place with Kemba Walker."" HELPING HAND Toronto recorded a season-high 36 assists on 50 made baskets, three shy of the franchisee-high. The Raptors had 24 assists in Friday's win over Boston. ALL ABOARD All 13 Raptors players recorded at least one made basket, and 12 of the 13 had at least one assist.

"MILWAUKEE --  Khris Middleton is finding plenty of freedom and fun in the Milwaukee Bucks' wide-open offense. Middleton sank 7 of 8 3-pointers and finished with 30 points -- including two critical 3s down the stretch -- as the Bucks held off the New York Knicks 124-113 on Monday night. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 15 rebounds and Eric Bledsoe added 16 points and 13 assists for the Bucks, who are 3-0 for the first time since 2005-06. ""There are so many interchangeable parts with the offense,"" Middleton said. ""Sharing the ball, moving the ball. The pace is crazy. But it's been fun. ""There are so many opportunities and different looks we get out of the offense."" Middleton's 3-pointer with 2:22 left gave the Bucks a 116-110 lead, and he sank another off a pick-and-roll with Brook Lopez to make it 122-113. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said he believes Middleton can be an elite 3-point shooter. The 6-foot-8 veteran is 15-for-23 (65 percent) from beyond the arc this season. ""We feel like he puts a lot of work and time into his craft,"" Budenholzer said. ""We're going to create great opportunities for everybody, including Khris. And he's done it before."" Antetokounmpo only had one 3, but it came in a big spot, giving Milwaukee the lead for good midway through the fourth period. He scored 16 points in the final quarter while playing through contact in the paint. ""I just want to win,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I tried to play harder, tried to get on my spots. It's the third game of the season. New coach, new game plan. ""I'm just trying to figure it out. And I will. And when I do, it's going to be so easy and I'm going to be a beast out there."" Tim Hardaway Jr. led the Knicks with 24 points. Trey Burke added 19 and Mario Hezonja had 18. New York outscored the Bucks 35-17 in the third quarter to pull within one point, led by Burke's 13-point outburst in the period. But the Knicks were outscored 36-26 in the fourth. ""This is the suffering you must go through to become a good basketball team,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""The best part about it is our guys found a way to make it a basketball game."" Middleton sank three consecutive 3-pointers to give the Bucks a 58-43 lead midway through the second quarter. He finished with 19 points in the half as Milwaukee rolled to a 71-52 lead. The Bucks made 10 of 20 3-pointers in the half, with Middleton making all four of his attempts. Milwaukee finished 17 of 40 from distance, giving them 48 3s on the season, the most in franchise history over a three-game stretch. ""You've got to pick your poison with that group,"" said Hardaway, who played under Budenholzer in Atlanta. ""Not only can they shoot the ball, they've got guys that can get into the paint whenever they want against any team. ""Coach (Budenholzer) gives them that freedom. They're going to be a force to be reckoned with."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York played without rookie forward Kevin Knox, who sprained his left ankle in a 103-101 loss at Boston on Saturday. ... Fizdale said he isn't ready to make a change in the starting lineup. Burke and Hardaway started in the backcourt, with Frank Ntilikina and Lance Thomas at forward and Enes Kanter at center. ""We're still going to make people work for it and earn it,"" Fizdale said. ""At the same time, I'm still looking at the next couple games. Then at some point, if I see a fit, I'm going to make a change."" Bucks: Third-year center Thon Maker was active for the first time this season and D.J. Wilson and Christian Wood were inactive. Maker did not play. ... Budenholzer said he likes his bench options, including rookie Donte DiVincenzo and veteran Ersan Ilyasova. ""His defense always stands out to me,"" the coach said of Ilyasova, who played under Budenholzer in Atlanta. ""He can guard big 5s. Offensively he has a knack for playing and it marries up with how we want to play."" Ilyasova had 10 points and eight rebounds in 22 minutes on Monday.","401070723"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Through the first three games of the season, the Minnesota Timberwolves were not playing the type of defense that head coach Tom Thibodeau wanted to see. That changed Monday night. Minnesota clamped down on the defensive end against Indiana as Jimmy Butler returned to the lineup to score 20 points to lead the Timberwolves to a 101-91 win over the Pacers. ""We played a little bit of defense finally,"" Butler said. ""It felt good."" Butler, who received a mix of boos and cheers during player introductions, sat out Saturday due to precautionary rest. Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota, while rookie guard Josh Okogie scored 12 points off the bench. Minnesota also played most of Monday's game without forward Andrew Wiggins, who exited in the first quarter due to a right quad contusion and did not return. Wiggins scored two points in eight minutes before the injury. Thibodeau said Wiggins is day-to-day and the team will know more Tuesday about the injury. Wiggins, a Toronto native, indicated that he'll play Wednesday at the Raptors. Okogie saw his minutes increase in Wiggins' absence. Okogie made the most of the extended playing time and the home crowd at Target Center gave the rookie a nice ovation as he took a seat on the bench late in the fourth quarter. While Okogie struggled from the floor early, he kept shooting at the behest of his teammates -- and his head coach. ""I just like the way he sort of persevered through it,"" Thibodeau said of Okogie. ""I thought the spirit of the team was strong. His teammates were encouraging him to shoot, and he just kept playing, which I think is important."" The Wolves led by as many as nine early before Indiana cut it to one point at the half. Victor Oladipo scored 15 of his 20 points before halftime to lead the Pacers. He has now scored at least 20 points in three straight games. Bojan Bogdanovic also had 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting for the Pacers, while Myles Turner chipped in 16. ""I feel like overall, they kinda forced us into some tough shots as well,"" Oladipo said. ""Credit them, they did a pretty good job defensively."" Minnesota's reserves went on a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter and take an 84-73 lead -- its biggest of the game. Derrick Rose scored four of his 11 points during the run to put the Wolves ahead after they trailed by one entering the fourth. After allowing 140 points in a loss Saturday to Dallas, Minnesota's defense tightened Monday against a Pacers team that scored 132 points its last time out. The Wolves held Indiana to just 38.8 percent shooting from the floor in the first half. The 91 points allowed was the first time Minnesota held a team under 100 this season. Indiana shot over 55 percent in two of its first three games before shooting 39.6 percent on Monday. ""I thought our shot collection was poor,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""We didn't have ball movement. Basically we were taking quick shots and taking quick, contested shots."" TIP-INS Pacers: F Domantas Sabonis returned to action Monday after missing Saturday's game against Brooklyn. Sabonis had eight points in 17 minutes off the bench. ... Indiana assigned C Ike Anigbogu to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA G League on Monday. Anigbogu played three minutes Saturday. Wolves: C Karl-Anthony Towns had 17 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. ... F Taj Gibson's 3-pointer in the first quarter Monday marked the first time he connected from downtown since Dec. 31, 2017, which also came against Indiana. COLD FROM DEEP The Timberwolves struggled from 3-point range in Monday's game, finishing 7-for-33 from behind the arc. They were just 3-of-26 after three quarters before shooting 4-of-7 in the fourth. PUSHING THE TEMPO Minnesota led Indiana in fast break points, 26-8. Much of that was a result of the Wolves' ability to get stops on the defensive end and turn the ball up the floor quickly. Ten of those fast break points came in the fourth quarter. ""Our stops got us into the open floor,"" Thibodeau said.","401070724"
"DALLAS --  DeAndre Jordan was a double-double machine before and after he stiffed the Dallas Mavericks in free agency three years ago. Now that the Texas native finally decided to join the Mavericks, the 6-11 center is up to the same old tricks. Jordan became the first Dallas player in 24 years to start a season with three straight double-doubles, getting 18 points and 16 rebounds to help the Mavericks beat the Chicago Bulls 115-109 on Monday night. ""He's just been sensational,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He's giving us a major presence on the inside. You add the personality and attitude that he brings to the game. On a night like tonight, you don't get over the top without it."" Luka Doncic scored 19 in the 19-year-old's second home game, another win that put the Mavericks (2-1) over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2015-16 season. Zach LaVine scored 34 for the Bulls and is the third Chicago player to open a season with three straight 30-point games. The others were Michael Jordan in 1986 and Bob Love in 1971. The Bulls are 0-3 for the second straight year, losing two nights after a two-point loss in their home opener following a blowout defeat in Philadelphia. ""We did a good job,"" said LaVine, who was 5 of 7 from 3-point range. ""It hurts just to know that you have two winnable games. Made mistakes, but I guess that's just part of the game. It's upsetting."" Wesley Matthews led six Dallas players in double figures with 20 points. Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney-Smith scored 12 apiece. J.J. Barea scored nine, including a long 3-pointer just before the third-quarter buzzer. The 30-footer, Barea's only make in seven shots behind the arc, was part of a 14-2 run covering the third and fourth quarters for a 96-86 lead after neither team had been up by more than five. Jordan secured his third double-double on the first of two straight offensive rebounds before finishing off the putback with the Mavs down five in the third quarter. The last Dallas player with three straight double-doubles to start a season was Popeye Jones in 1994. Jordan is averaging 17 points and 12.2 rebounds. ""I'm just trying to do my job,"" said Jordan, who has had at least 41 double-doubles each of the past five seasons. ""Whenever Dennis (Smith Jr.) and Wes and J.J.  and Luka, our playmakers, make a play when I roll to the basket, I just try to finish and take what the defense gives us."" Chicago cut a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to five in the final minute, but Doncic, the third overall pick, collected a bad pass by No. 7 overall choice Wendell Carter Jr. in the backcourt after a Dallas miss and hit the layup. Jabari Parker scored 20 points for Chicago but had just four after halftime. Doncic led the Mavericks with six assists, including a nifty one to Jordan that included a fake in the first half. NEW DAD'S DEBUT Kris Dunn had nine points of 4-of-13 shooting with seven assists before fouling out late in his debut. The Chicago guard missed the first two games for the birth of his first child. ""First half, I was solid,"" Dunn said. ""Second half, I got a little winded and careless."" BACK AND FORTH There were 12 lead changes in the first half, including on seven straight buckets early in the second quarter. The last was on a 3-pointer by LaVine for a 47-45 Chicago lead. There were three more ties before halftime, with Cameron Payne hitting a floater in the final minute to put the Bulls up 61-59 at the break. The game finished with 17 lead changes. CHOICE WORD, TECH Robin Lopez wasn't happy with referee Sean Corbin's explanation after the Chicago center was called for a foul when he got tangled with Dwight Powell in the first quarter. Lopez appeared upset that Corbin said he was ""trying to help"" the big man from Stanford, and Lopez used the word ""platitudes"" in his retort. The big word was preceded by an expletive, and Corbin signaled for a technical foul. TIP-INS Bulls: Carter was overshadowed by Doncic in the matchup of top 10 picks from this year's draft. He finished with four points, but did lead the Bulls with nine rebounds. ... Justin Holliday scored 16 points, and Bobby Portis had 12. Mavericks: Doncic became youngest Dallas player to record a 20-point game with 26 in his home debut, a 140-136 win over Minnesota. He beat Smith, who did it as a rookie last November, by 113 days. ... Harrison Barnes (hamstring) and Dirk Nowitzki (ankle) are still awaiting their season debuts. Devin Harris missed a second straight game with a hamstring injury.","401070725"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Memphis Grizzlies took a page out of their classic playbook, using hard-nosed defense and a controlled pace on offense to top the Utah Jazz. Mike Conley had 23 points and Marc Gasol finished with 18 points as Memphis earned its first road win of the season, beating the Jazz 92-84 Monday night. The Grizzlies prevailed despite shooting 36.9 percent (31 of 84). ""It says we've got a lot of grit on this team,"" Conley said. ""We've got a lot of guys who've got a lot to prove, play with a lot of energy. We play together. We stick together through adversity.""

Utah could not find its outside shot and struggled to get an edge inside with Gasol disrupting things around the basket. ""I think that we had spurts where we got stagnant,"" Mitchell said. ""Just little things. I think that they took us out of what we wanted to do. That can't happen."" A trio of 3-pointers from Shelvin Mack and Wayne Seldin fueled a 16-4 run for Memphis in the fourth quarter. Garrett Temple capped the outburst with a layup that gave Grizzlies an 86-70 lead with 3:49 remaining. Gobert converted a three-point play and Utah whittled its deficit to 88-82 with 50.9 seconds left. The Jazz had a chance to make it a one possession game, but Mitchell missed a 3-pointer with 22.4 seconds left. It was a fitting end to a sloppy offensive outing for Utah. ""The substance of this team is the fact that we move the ball and work together to get good shots and we didn't do that tonight,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We got some good looks but consistently we didn't move the ball like we need to and make the extra pass. We can't play that way."" Neither offense generated much in the first half. Memphis shot just 41.5 percent from the floor over the first two quarters. The Jazz connected on 38.6 percent of their shots in the first half. Utah led by five points twice in the first quarter. The Jazz went up 14-9 on back-to-back baskets by Joe Ingles, and then 22-17 on consecutive dunks from Dante Exum and Derrick Favors. Memphis pulled ahead early in the second quarter with a 13-4 run. Jaren Jackson fueled the run with a pair of hook shots and a free throw, helping the Grizzlies take a 32-26 lead. Utah briefly rallied when Mitchell drove for a layup and sank a jumper on back-to-back possessions, giving the Jazz a 41-40 lead. The Grizzlies pulled back in front before halftime and built up a 10-point third quarter lead, going up 66-56 on a pair of free throws from Conley.

BACK ON BOARDS Marc Gasol collected as many rebounds against the Jazz as he totaled in his first two games combined. Gasol averaged just 6.5 rebounds in his first two games. His effort on the glass went a long way for the Grizzlies in combating Utah's frontcourt duo of Gobert and Favors. ""He's kind of the horse that pulls the plow,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Time and time again, when called upon, he goes out and does the job."" FREE THROW ACCURACY Through three games, Utah is proving to be a consistent team at the line.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Markieff Morris couldn't believe the Blazers kept leaving him open. Morris had 28 points, including a career-high six 3-pointers, and the Washington Wizards won their first game of the season with a 125-124 overtime victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. ""After the second (3-pointer) I was like, `Are they really gonna let me shoot the ball?' I think that's the most I ever shot,"" Morris said. ""I was playing (Jusuf) Nurkic and he couldn't cover the pick and roll and the three so they just had to give something up."" Bradley Beal added 25 points for the Wizards, and Otto Porter Jr. blocked Damian Lillard's layup attempt at the final buzzer to seal the win. There were 29 lead changes and 23 ties. Lillard had 29 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Trail Blazers, who lost their first game after opening the season 2-0. Morris had a layup and a free throw to put the Wizards ahead 120-117 in overtime. Lillard's layup got Portland closer, but Morris landed a 3-pointer with 38.5 seconds left. Lillard's jumper got Portland within a basket before John Wall's 17-footer with 10.1 second left looked to all but seal it for the Wizards. CJ McCollum made it interesting with a 3-pointer for the Blazers and Wall missed a pair of free throws, but Porter blocked Lillard's attempt to win it with a layup at the buzzer. ""The kind of effort we had, we put ourselves in position to win the game,"" Lillard said. ""We just didn't execute, on the defensive end or the offensive end, as good as we needed to to win it. That's frustrating."" Nurkic finished with 22 points and 18 rebounds for the Blazers. The game was close throughout the second half. Portland led 102-97 with 3:08 left but the Wizards pulled in front 105-103 on Morris' 3-pointer. Lillard's 3-pointer tied it again at 108 with 52.2 second left. Nik Stauskas hit a 3-pointer to put Portland ahead with 13 seconds left. But Beal made a 3 for the Wizards with 7.4 seconds to go to tie it again and the game went to overtime. Blazers coach Terry Stotts praised Morris. ""That was a tough matchup with guarding the pick and roll with him. We brought Moe (Harkless) in and they went down to the post. He had a terrific game, inside and out."" It was the first of a five-game road trip for the Wizards, who lost two at home to open the season, including a 117-113 loss to Toronto on Saturday night. Beal scored 32 points and became the career leader in 3-pointers in the loss and coach Scott Brooks was ejected on a technical. Washington continues to await the season debut of Dwight Howard, who missed all of training camp with gluteal soreness.

After trailing most of the third quarter, Portland pulled back in front on Evan Turner's short jumper from out front that made it 75-74. But it was short-lived and the Wizards led 78-77 heading into the final quarter. TIP INS Wizards: The two teams split their series 1-1 last season. ... The Wizards also won their last two games at the Moda Center. Trail Blazers: It was an early Halloween for the Blazers, who arrived at the Moda Center in Halloween costumes. Lillard arguably won the night as Stone Cold Steve Austin. Harkless was dressed as Chappelle Show character Tyrone Biggums. GOING SMALL: Wizards coach Scott Brooks saw success with a smaller lineup against the Blazers. ""We're definitely going to play it for long stretches,"" Brooks said.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors got back to their pass-happy ways and coach Steve Kerr could smile again about all those assists, fewer fouls and a better night taking care of the ball. ""We understand what the keys to our success are and when we don't do them we make the game extremely tough and give the other team life in terms of more possessions,"" Curry said. Curry scored 15 of his 29 points in the third quarter and also had eight assists, leading the Warriors past the Phoenix Suns 123-103 on Monday night. Kevin Durant scored 22 points and Draymond Green dished out eight of 35 assists for the two-time defending NBA champions. Kerr had been disappointed in his team's passing, rushed shots and ball movement so far. He is pleased with the progress: The Warriors shot 51.1 percent in the second of a back-to-back following a two-point loss at Denver on Sunday, which came after a one-point win Friday at Utah. ""That looked like our team, just the purpose of each possession, driving and kicking and trying to get guys better shots,"" he said. The Warriors won a 16th straight against Phoenix, their longest unbeaten run against a team in franchise history. Golden State's 14 straight home victories versus the Suns is a franchise mark, as well. Klay Thompson scored 16 points but missed his initial four 3-point tries and finished 1 of 6 from deep, making him 3 for 22 through four games. He sustained what is considered a mild ankle sprain, telling Kerr he could have returned. New Golden State starting center Damian Jones dunked three times in the initial 4:03 -- a pair of them on alley-oops -- and Durant had one in transition, too. Phoenix called timeout down 12-7 at the 7:34 mark after KD's slam. Jones also added an early three-point play on a putback and finished with 13 points. He had nine and four rebounds in the opening eight minutes. Devin Booker scored 28 points, TJ Warren had 27 off the bench and Deandre Ayton added 20 points and 14 rebounds for Phoenix.

Curry shot 11 for 18 with six 3-pointers. He had scored 30 or more points in each of his initial three games this season but didn't play the entire fourth quarter Monday.

Phoenix won at Oracle Arena during the preseason. Warriors: Reserve G Shaun Livingston sat out with a bruised left knee. ... The Warriors are averaging 119.8 points during the winning streak against the Suns. ... Golden State's first three games were decided by 11 total points. ... The Warriors completed the first set of 13 back-to-backs -- which will be their fewest total since the NBA began an 82-game schedule in 1967-68. COUSINS UPDATE Center DeMarcus Cousins will begin doing more ""controlled aspects"" of team drills during practice, increasing from the extensive individual work he has largely been limited to so far during his recovery from surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon. Cousins still won't be rushed into full scrimmaging but perhaps some light work when the young players scrimmage, Kerr said. ""He's doing fine, he's doing well,"" Kerr said. Cousins has been a big support for Jones, hopping off the bench to encourage the third-year pro and offering insight during timeouts. UNICYCLE GIFT Rong Niu, the Red Panda halftime performer, received a new custom-made unicycle courtesy of the Warriors and it was presented by team President and COO Rick Welts. Niu's previous unicycle was stolen in January from the luggage area at San Francisco International Airport. Niu let out a ""Yeah!"" and pumped her fist after successfully flipping the bowls onto her head. Afterward, an emotional Red Panda took a bow, brought the house down, and said, ""Thank you so much!"" ""She's been amazing. She's one of the great halftime acts in sports,"" Kerr said. ""So I think that's great she'll be here tonight. I will ask for a report from you guys afterward because I'll be busy at halftime. I'm happy that she got her bike back.""","401070728"
"Lakers head coach Luke Walton criticizes the lack of free throws for the Lakers and others getting rewarded for ""flopping 30 feet from the hole."" (1:09) LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James hit the tying 3-pointer late in regulation. He led a Lakers lineup of three second-year pros and a rookie making his NBA debut to a 142-136 lead with 55 seconds left overtime. James was then reminded in spectacular fashion that nothing will be easy in this West Coast chapter of his career. Patty Mills hit a go-ahead jumper with 6.8 seconds left and the San Antonio Spurs kept the Lakers winless with LeBron, rallying from a six-point deficit in the final minute of OT for a wild 143-142 victory Monday night. James tied it on a magisterial 3 with 2.4 seconds left in regulation, and he finished his second Lakers home game with 32 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds. But the superstar missed two free throws with 12.8 seconds to play before Mills coolly put the Spurs ahead. James then missed a step-back 3-pointer at the buzzer, thoroughly deflating Staples Center as the Lakers fell to the first 0-3 start in James' career since his second season with Cleveland in 2004-05. After cooling down, LeBron did not seem discouraged by the Lakers' last-minute failure against a quality opponent -- and while Los Angeles was missing suspended starters Rajon Rondo and Brandon Ingram . ""It's not"" discouraging, James said. ""I know what I got myself into,"" he added. ""It's a process. I get it, and we'll be fine. I didn't come here thinking we were going to be blazing, storming right out of the gate. It's a process, and I understand that."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 37 points and 10 rebounds, and DeMar DeRozan added 32 points and 14 assists before Mills made the biggest shot. The Australian guard did it while playing Tony Parker's traditional role on a familiar San Antonio play. ""It's always good when you make shots or make an impact,"" Mills said. ""Other than that shot, it was a team victory. It was a gutsy win. Everyone participated."" Kyle Kuzma had 37 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers, and Josh Hart added 20 points and 10 rebounds. James' dramatic 3 from a full step beyond the arc capped the Lakers' improbable rally from an eight-point deficit in the final 1:04 of regulation. The Lakers then took a 142-136 lead late in overtime with huge contributions from unsung rookie big man Johnathan Williams, who played important minutes in his NBA debut after JaVale McGee fouled out. But the Lakers sputtered and the Spurs rallied. Rudy Gay's 3-pointer cut the Lakers' lead to 142-141, and James missed his free throws before the jumper by Mills, who had 12 points. ""It's always fun to play close games and have them be that type of atmosphere, and overly competitive,"" Aldridge said. ""It was nice to get a close win. It just builds character and makes guys be more confident."" TIP-INS Spurs: Dante Cunningham had three points and 12 rebounds in 29 minutes as a starter. Jakob Poeltl, who started the first two games, didn't play. ... Marco Belinelli scored 15 points in a reserve role for the Spurs, and Rudy Gay had 16 points. Lakers: Svi Mykhailiuk and Williams made their NBA debuts in the shortened rotation. Mykhailiuk went scoreless in 17 minutes, but he got an assist on Williams' dunk for his first NBA bucket. Williams finished with eight points. NO CALLS Lakers coach Luke Walton was infuriated by the officiating which gave 38 free throws to the Spurs and just 26 to Los Angeles, even though the Lakers outscored San Antonio 74-50 in the paint. Walton got a technical foul in the second quarter for protesting a no-call on contact with James, but his postgame complaints were multifold. McGee was fouled out after scoring 16 points, and Ivica Zubac was called for five fouls in less than five minutes. Hart, an aggressive driver to the hoop, wasn't given a free throw in nearly 39 minutes of action. ""I know they're young, I get that,"" an animated Walton said. ""But if we're going to play a certain way, let's not reward people for flopping 30 feet from the hole on plays that have nothing to do with that possession ... and then not reward players that are physically going to the basket and getting hit. It's not right."" BANNED BALLERS Ingram and Rondo began their suspensions stemming from their brawl with the Houston Rockets last Saturday. Ingram got a four-game ban for confronting an official and throwing punches, while Rondo got three games for punching and spitting on Chris Paul. THE REPLACEMENTS Kuzma and Lonzo Ball were in the starting lineup in their teammates' absence, and both second-year pros excelled. Kuzma finished one point shy of his career high, while Ball had 14 points, six assists and six rebounds. ""We've just got to get over the hump,"" Kuzma said. ""It'll be a breath of fresh air when we get our first win. The three teams we've played, they've all been together for quite some time. That means something.""","401070729"
"DETROIT --  Blake Griffin has heard the critics, but the veteran forward knows it'll take more nights like Tuesday to get where his team wants to go. Griffin scored a career-high 50 points and had the game-winner after he was fouled on a driving layup with 1.8 seconds left as Detroit topped Philadelphia 133-132 in a wild overtime thriller. Riddled with injuries during his last few years with the Los Angeles Clippers and then traded last season by his first pro team, Griffin has talked this offseason after proving something. Point proven. ""The past two or three years, all I hear about is how bad I am,"" Griffin said. ""It's a big win, but we've got to move on. This is game three and now we've got to move on to game four."" The Pistons are 3-0 for the first time since 2015-16, the last time they made the playoffs, topping the 76ers, who were without Ben Simmons, nursing back tightness. JJ Redick's four-point play with 5.6 seconds left in overtime set up Griffin's dramatics, while Joel Embiid, who had 33 points and 11 rebounds, missed a potential game-winner at the buzzer after working a two-man game with Redick. ""We were trying to bait the switch, you know maybe slip Joel to the rim, maybe step him out,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""Joel had an open look and just wasn't able to knock it down."" Griffin faked a handoff on the final play and drove the lane for the basket, getting fouled by Robert Covington. He made the ensuing free throw. ""Out of all the great players I worked with, Dirk (Nowitzki), Kyle Lowry, Kevin Garnett, Shawn Kemp, all those guys, he's playing at that high a level right now,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""But again that is what we expect from Blake because he is that good of a player."" Griffin was 20 of 35 from the field, going 5 for 10 on 3-pointers, scoring his most points as a member of the Pistons for the second straight game. He missed his first six free throws of the game. ""It starts with like believing,"" Griffin said. ""I saw a lot of times last year where guys were kind of like defeated. Everybody stayed positive, and that was huge."" And Griffin stayed hot. He dunked on Embiid with 3:50 to go in the second quarter, a frame where he scored 22 points. ""Some of us tried to stop him, and he just had an amazing day,"" said Dario Saric, who scored 14 points for Philly. ""We tried everything but sometimes you can't, you know?"" Redick had 30 points and scored a 3-pointer while being fouled by Reggie Jackson after the Pistons point guard made two free throws to take a 130-128 lead. Jackson had 23 points and Ish Smith scored 21 for the Pistons. Detroit took the lead for the first time since late in the first quarter as two Griffin free throws put the Pistons up 111-110 with 3:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. Then, down the stretch of regulation, the teams traded the lead six times, with three ties. With the teams tied 120-all, Embiid missed a 3-pointer and Reggie Bullock missed a runner in the lane. On the final play of regulation, Saric had an open look on a 3-pointer but missed it in the closing seconds. TIP-INS 76ers: Rookie guard Landry Shamet made his first career start for Philadelphia.

Mike Muscala, acquired in a three-team trade from Atlanta this offseason, made his debut of for the 76ers after missing the first three games with a sprained ankle. He scored five points in 17 minutes. Pistons: Andre Drummond was ejected with 40.8 seconds left in regulation after his second technical foul. . Glenn Robinson III, acquired as a free agent from Indiana, did not play after logging 33 minutes combined in the first two games. BEN'S BAD BACK Brown said Simmons is questionable for Wednesday at Milwaukee after leaving Saturday's game against Orlando in the first quarter. ""He didn't feel as comfortable as we would've wanted,"" Brown said. ""It's just one of those things that with a back-to-back game and giving him the best chance we could give him to possibly play (Wednesday), we felt like it was wise to sit him tonight."" CAREER NIGHT Starting at point guard with Simmons out, Markelle Fultz tied his career high with 13 points. He knocked down a long two-pointer for the game's first points and later making his second career 3-pointer.

""Not the defense we hoped for but we're not going to hold everyone under 100."" Jamal Murray scored 14 of his 19 points in the third quarter and Nikola Jokic had 14 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Nuggets, who have won their first four games for the first time since starting 5-0 in 2009-10.

""It's a long season but we're going to ride the momentum while we've got it."" The Nuggets remained unbeaten despite allowing a team to break the century mark in points for the first time this season. The Nuggets held opponents to an NBA-best 95.7 points in the first three games but simply outscored Sacramento, which entered Tuesday second in the NBA in scoring at 125.7 points a game. Gary Harris scored 18 points and Paul Millsap added 15 for Denver. ""They are a tough team to play, they're physical and they take care of their home court,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They have found a nice rhythm."" Denver's early defense helped build a 13-point halftime lead that grew to as much as 26 in the third quarter. Jokic, who was named the NBA Western Conference player of the week on Monday, had 11 points and 10 rebounds at halftime. He hit a 3-pointer to start the third quarter and then Murray took over.

"ATLANTA --  Trae Young struggled through three forgettable quarters, hardly the sort of debut he was hoping for in Atlanta. Then, with the game on the line, the rookie showed why the Hawks are counting on him to be the face of the franchise. Kent Bazemore scored a career-high 32 points, Young bounced back in the final period and the youthful Hawks rallied from a 26-point deficit to stun the Dallas Mavericks 111-104 Wednesday night. To show how much Young means to Atlanta in only his fourth NBA game, Taurean Prince pulled the rookie aside with about 4 minutes remaining and the outcome very much in doubt. ""Get it going,"" Prince told the 20-year-old guard. ""We're going to follow you."" That's just what the Hawks did. Young scored 12 of his 17 points in the final quarter, spinning away from Dennis Smith Jr. with an electrifying move and getting to the line over and over again. ""That was some grown-man stuff right there,"" Bazemore said. ""I'm proud of him for hanging in there."" Young emerged victorious in his rookie showdown with Luca Doncic, who finished with 21 points but hit only 3 of 10 shots over the final two quarters. ""Some people are going to say he scored more points than me, so that makes him better,"" Young said. ""At the end of the day, I'm just glad my team won. That's the main thing for me."" The Hawks made it a night to remember at newly rechristened State Farm Arena, which hosted its first game after a $192.5 million renovation. The crowd spent much of the first half enjoying the amenities, including a barber shop overlooking the court, but really got into the game as the home team kept creeping closer and closer. ""Thank you Atlanta,"" Young told the fans after the game. ""This is just the beginning."" Coming off a 35-point, 11-assist performance in a victory at Cleveland, Young struggled with his shot, got into a bit of foul trouble and kept turning the ball over, helping Dallas race to a 51-25 lead only 4 minutes into the second quarter. But the Hawks turned things around before halftime, closing to 58-48 at the break, and they finally passed the Mavs when Young was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 5:13 remaining. He swished all three free throws, putting Atlanta ahead for the first time all night, 96-95. Bazemore finished with a flourish , spotting an opening down the middle of the lane and jamming it through with the left hand to make it 105-101 with 1:06 remaining. ""I haven't seen that since high school,"" Bazemore said with a grin. ""It was like the Red Sea parting."" The Mavericks equaled the third-biggest blown lead in franchise history. ""We took our foot off the gas,"" Wesley Matthews said. ""We thought it was going to be an easy game. Credit them. They didn't quit."" FOREVER LINKED Young and Doncic are likely to be compared for the rest of their careers. The Hawks selected the 19-year-old Slovenian with the No. 3 overall pick, only to deal him to the Mavericks in exchange for Young, who was taken at No. 5. Atlanta also picked up 2019 first-round selection in the deal. DEDMON RETURNS Dewayne Dedmon made his season debut for the Hawks after missing the first three games recovering from left ankle injury. The 7-foot center played 14 minutes, sank a 3-pointer and grabbed five rebounds. TIP-INS Mavericks: Coach Rick Carlisle was asked before the game how his team could improve its defense against the 3-pointer. ""Get closer to them,"" he quipped.

"CLEVELAND --  Life without LeBron James has been harder so far than the Cleveland Cavaliers hoped. Cleveland fell to 0-4 after a 102-86 loss to Brooklyn on Wednesday night. D'Angelo Russell scored 18 points, Joe Harris added 16 and the Nets outscored the Cavaliers 38-17 in the third quarter to pull away. James led the Cavaliers to four straight NBA Finals and a championship in 2016, but the four-time MVP signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in the summer. His absence was obviously going to leave a void, but blowout losses at home to Atlanta and Brooklyn have been especially disappointing for the Cavs. ""We need a `W' on the board, for sure,"" said All-Star forward Kevin Love. ""Obviously we thought we'd be in a different position right now."" Love was one of three Cleveland players to score a team-high 14 points. The 11-year veteran said the Cavaliers didn't show any fight in the second half during their latest loss. ""These are big growing pains and we need to get through these,"" he said. ""Guys have to continue to fight. Can't hang their heads, can't have bad body language. This isn't the previous four years. We have to fight for everything that we've got."" The Cavaliers lost their first two games on the road to Toronto and Minnesota. Cleveland was coming off a 133-111 loss in its home opener to the Hawks. The Cavaliers are 0-4 for the first time since losing their first five games in 2003-04 when James was a rookie. Cleveland will face a difficult task Thursday with a road game against Detroit and Blake Griffin, who scored 50 points in an overtime win over Philadelphia on Tuesday. The first half had 11 lead changes and the teams were tied at 45 going to halftime before the Nets took over. Brooklyn hit 16 of 22 from the field in the third quarter to pull away. Harris made a 3-pointer that put the Nets up 50-47 and Brooklyn never trailed again. Jared Dudley's second 3-pointer of the run pushed the lead to 68-50 with 6:12 remaining in the quarter. ""Just by moving the basketball, we went from getting good shots to great shots,"" Harris said. ""As long as you're doing that, the shots are going to start falling. We're trying to build on games like this. Hopefully, we can keep it going."" The Nets maintained a lead over 20 points for most of the fourth quarter, causing many in the crowd at Quicken Loans to head for the exits. The Nets placed six players in double figures. Dudley scored 12 points. Jordan Clarkson and rookie Collin Sexton also scored 14 points for Cleveland. Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and guard Shabazz Napier made their season debuts. Jefferson, out with a hip injury and the birth of his first child, scored seven points in 17 minutes. Napier, sidelined with a strained right hamstring, scored eight points in 11 minutes. The Nets broke a 10-game losing streak in Cleveland and won for the first time at Quicken Loans Arena since April 3, 2013. TIP-INS Nets: F Rodions Kurucs (sprained left ankle) was unavailable and will not play Friday at New Orleans. Coach Kenny Atkinson said his status will be updated this weekend. ... F Treveon Graham (strained left hamstring) and F DeMarre Carroll (right ankle surgery) remain out. Cavaliers: Veterans Kyle Korver and J.R. Smith came off the bench in the first quarter after not playing Sunday. Korver had two points in 19 minutes while Smith scored seven points in 18 minutes... Cleveland was 6 of 26 from the field in the first quarter. ... Love had 10 points in the first half, the only Cleveland player to reach double figures in the first two quarters. EVEN START The Nets have split their first four games and Atkinson gave credit to the defense Wednesday. ""Holding a team to 86 points with Kevin Love and Rodney Hood and a lot of explosive scorers, that's a heck of a job by our guys,"" he said. MAKE A SHOT, PLEASE The Cavaliers were 3 of 18 on 3-point attempts Wednesday and have made 28 of 87 from behind the arc for the season. ""We have to make shots,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""If we're open for the 3, we have to let it go.""","401070734"
"MIAMI --  The Heat took advantage of a third-quarter stoppage in play Wednesday to show a video montage of highlights from Chris Bosh's years with the team, including his championship moments. It fired up the crowd. Seemed to fire up the Heat, too. With Bosh and his family watching from courtside, Hassan Whiteside scored 22 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, Josh Richardson added 21 points and Miami scored 45 points in the third quarter to fuel what became an easy 110-87 win over former Heat assistant David Fizdale and the New York Knicks. ""Kind of a weird night,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I love Fiz and I love CB."" That was on full display afterward. After the final horn, Fizdale lingered on the court and hugged several Heat coaches and players, with Dwyane Wade getting the last of those embraces. Wade presented Fizdale with one of his jerseys, leading to yet another hug between them. Meanwhile, Bosh had sauntered onto the court at that point, and Spoelstra grabbed him in a bear hug and lifted him off the ground. Just like old times, sort of. ""It's always special that you've got people who care about you, that you've invested a lot in and they've invested a lot in you,"" Fizdale said. ""I told Spo when we met at half-court, `That's no way to treat a friend. When I come to your house, you're not supposed to beat me like that."" Spoelstra knows Fizdale doesn't believe that. ""He would do the same to me,"" Spoelstra said. They would compete against each other in anything and everything when they worked together in Miami, even racing to see who could get to the door first. There wasn't much competition on Wednesday, as the Heat outscored the Knicks 76-38 in the middle two quarters. Rodney McGruder added 19 points on only eight shot attempts and Goran Dragic scored 13 points for the Heat. Miami's 45-point third tied the third-highest scoring period in franchise history, sparked by going 8 of 10 from 3-point range. ""We stepped on them and never looked back,"" McGruder said. Damyean Dotson scored 20 for New York, which got 14 from Tim Hardaway Jr. and 13 from Mario Hezonja. The Knicks were outscored 24-0 from 3-point range in that pivotal third quarter, missing all eight of their tries from beyond the arc. The 23-point margin of victory was Miami's fifth-largest ever against New York. The only good stretch for New York all night was late in the first quarter. The Knicks outscored Miami 14-0 in the final 2:33 of the quarter, a run sparked by back-to-back 3s by Hezonja and Dotson. That put New York up 27-16 after the first. After that, it was all Heat for much of the rest of the night. TIP-INS Knicks: New York didn't make a free throw until early in the third quarter. The Knicks were 0 for 2 from the line in the first half. ... Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) remained sidelined, and has yet to make his 2018-19 debut. Courtney Lee (neck spasms) was also out. He missed six games last season; he's missed five already this season. Heat: Duncan Robinson, whose college career started at Division III Williams before he wound up at Michigan, got his first NBA minutes -- and made his first shot, a 3-pointer. ... Miami has trailed by double digits in three of its first four games. The lone exception was last week's win at Washington, where the biggest deficit the Heat faced was nine points. ... The Heat outscored the Knicks by 25 points in the third, matching the sixth-best score differential in a quarter in franchise history. BANNER RETURNS Plenty of Heat greats were there. Tim Hardaway Sr., the father of the Knicks guard and one of three players to have his Heat jersey number swaying from the rafters in Miami, was at the game. So was Bosh and Jason Williams, the point guard from Miami's 2006 champions. GAME 2 Ashley Moyer-Gleich was one of the officials assigned to the game by the NBA. It was the second regular-season game for Gleich, who remains a non-staff official. She and fellow non-staff official Natalie Sago made their debuts on Monday.","401070735"
"TORONTO --  With his highest-scoring game of the season, Kawhi Leonard kept the Toronto Raptors rolling along. Leonard scored 35 points, Kyle Lowry had 13 points and 10 assists, and the Raptors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-105 on Wednesday night to improve to 5-0 and match the best start in franchise history. ""We're on the right track,"" Leonard said. ""We've won every game so far and we've just got to keep going."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 16 points, Serge Ibaka had 15 and Norman Powell added a season-high 10 for the Raptors, who also won five straight to start the 2015-16 season. ""They got points in the paint, they got open 3s, they got out in transition,"" Minnesota's Jimmy Butler said. ""We didn't take too many things away from them tonight and they capitalized at every opportunity."" Toronto won its 15th straight home game against Minnesota, extending its franchise record for consecutive home victories over a single opponent. The last time the Raptors lost at home to the Timberwolves was Jan. 21, 2004. Butler scored 23 points, Derrick Rose had 16 and Taj Gibson 13 for Minnesota, which has yet to win back-to-back games this season. ""We played from behind all night,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Minnesota guard Andrew Wiggins was inactive for only the second time in his career, sitting out because of a bruised right quadriceps. Wiggins, who is from suburban Toronto, left in the first quarter of Monday's win over Indiana and did not return. Rookie Josh Okogie started in place of Wiggins and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds. Leonard shot 15 for 23, going 2 for 4 from 3-point range, and had 10 points came in the fourth quarter. Butler said Leonard looks like the player he was before missing all but nine games because of injury last season. ""He's there,"" Butler said. ""He's shooting the ball with confidence. The athleticism is there, he's passing it well, guarding. I think he's going to be just fine here. ""When you have a team like they have and a player of his caliber, the game gets really easy for him and for everybody else,"" Butler added. Toronto was up by 17 points in the fourth but Towns scored to cut it to 106-101 with 1:16 remaining. Following a timeout, Leonard drove for a jumpshot over Rose, pushing the lead to seven. Minnesota called timeout and gave the ball to Jeff Teague, but his missed shot was rebounded by Ibaka. Leonard was fouled and made both, putting the Raptors up by nine points with 38 seconds to go. TIP-INS Timberwolves: The last time Wiggins was inactive was Nov. 10, 2015, when he sat out a loss to Charlotte because of a sore right knee. ... Teague led Minnesota with nine assists. ... All five Minnesota starters reached double figures in scoring. Raptors: G Delon Wright (left thigh) returned after missing the first four games of the season. Wright went scoreless in five first-half minutes but did not return following the intermission because of soreness in his groin. ... G Fred VanVleet (sprained left big toe) was inactive. ... Valanciunas matched a career high with two made 3-pointers. ... Lowry had six rebounds. ... Toronto outscored Minnesota 56-38 in the paint. DEAR MR. FANTASY Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns shot 5 for 17 and scored 14 points, but was more upset at the result than his poor shooting. ""A loss is a loss,"" Towns said. ""It's about winning. It's not about the statistical achievements, doing this or that for whoever my fantasy owner is."" CENTURY CLUB For the first time in franchise history, Toronto has won five straight games despite allowing 100 or more points in each. CAGED WOLVES Toronto is 30-15 against Minnesota, its best record against any opponent.","401070736"
"CHICAGO --  After missing one potential winning shot in the final seconds, Zach LaVine was determined to give himself another opportunity. He made good on the second chance. LaVine made two free throws with 0.5 seconds left to give the Chicago Bulls their first victory of the season, 112-110 over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. With the score tied at 110, LaVine missed a jumper with seven seconds left. Charlotte called time to set up a potential winning play, but LaVine forced a turnover on the inbounds pass, giving Chicago the ball back with five seconds to play. He was fouled driving to the basket to set up the winning free throws. He finished with 32 points for his fourth straight 30-point game to start the season. ""I wasn't going to miss again,"" LaVine said. ""They were going to have to foul me or I was going to get a dunk."" Cameron Payne scored all of his career-high 21 points in the second half, going 7 for 11 on 3 pointers for Chicago in the opener of the home-and-home set with the Hornets. Kemba Walker had 23 points on 5-for-14 shooting for Charlotte. ""I thought we missed some open looks, but they did a great job on the defensive end,"" Walker said. ""They play hard. They really deserve that win."" The Bulls had a 54-53 halftime lead mainly thanks to 35 bench points. Jabari Parker had nine, and Cristiano Felicio and Chandler Hutchison had eight apiece. The trio combined to go 10 for 14 from the field. Before Wednesday, Felicio hadn't played this season and Hutchison had a total of three points in two games. ""We just did not defend well enough in the first half,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""That was unacceptable defense. Especially when shots aren't falling, you got to be on your defense."" Chicago stretched the advantage to 85-74 with 2 1/2 minutes left in the third on a 3-pointer by Payne -- his fifth of the quarter. The lead was 88-78 with a minute remaining in the third before Charlotte ran off 11 straight points -- capped by Tony Parker's jumper -- to grab an 89-88 edge with 10 1/2 minutes to play in the fourth. After the teams traded baskets and the lead for a few minutes, the Hornets seemingly took control with a 103-98 lead with 5 1/2 left. The Bulls, though, rallied to tie it at 105 on a Payne 3-pointer with 3:34 to play. That set the stage for LaVine's stretch drive. ""I love his attack,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I love the way he goes after the rim and gets into the paint."" CAN'T MISS LaVine actually tried to miss the second free throw with 0.5 seconds left, but his awkward line drive bounced off the rim and through. ""That's crazy, right?"" he said. ""I really tried to miss that. It was only point-5 seconds left, so if I would have got it off the rim, the game would have been over."" KEEP SHOOTING Payne, starting in place of injured Kris Dunn, missed both of his shots in the first half before getting hot. ""My mentality was just to keep being aggressive and Zach kept finding me,"" Payne said. TIP-INS Hornets: Borrego, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Walker each were assessed technical fouls in the first half. Bulls: F Bobby Portis injured his right knee early in the fourth quarter and did not return. He is scheduled to have an MRI on Thursday ... Dunn sprained the MCL in his left knee on Monday against Dallas and will be sidelined four to six weeks. Dunn injured the knee in the second quarter, but continued to play, finishing with nine points and seven assists before fouling out.","401070737"
"HOUSTON --  Just four games into the season the Houston Rockets already have three losses, have dealt with the suspension of Chris Paul and now must wait to see if a hamstring injury will cause James Harden to miss any time. Donovan Mitchell scored 38 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 100-89 victory over the Rockets on Wednesday night in a game Harden left with what the team called tightness in his left hamstring. The Rockets got within five points midway through the fourth quarter but Harden headed to the locker room soon after and didn't return. With Harden out, the Jazz regained control, scoring the next 10 points to make it 94-79 and cruise to the victory. ""Just felt tightness in my left hamstring,"" Harden said. ""We'll see how it feels tomorrow."" Harden missed seven games last season with a Grade 2 hamstring strain and said this was not the same type of injury. ""It's nothing serious. Nothing serious,"" he said. ""It's not close to last year. Just being cautious."" Harden scored 29 points and Carmelo Anthony had a season-high 22 for the Rockets, who were missing two starters. Paul finished up a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with the Lakers last week and James Ennis sat out with a strained right hamstring. Eric Gordon made his second straight start in place of Paul and Michael Carter-Williams made his first start of the season with Ennis on the bench. Coach Mike D'Antoni knows that no one is happy about how the team is playing right now, but he's confident that his group will turn things around soon. ""Bad start, we get it, but I saw some things tonight that we can get better at, work on and it's not that far off,"" he said. ""We'll get CP back on Friday ... (and) we're going to do this and this team is going to be good. This team is going to be really good. We just got to hang in there for a little bit and go through some growing pains."" Utah got this season's series with Houston off on a good note after the Rockets beat the Jazz 4-1 in the Western Conference semifinals after winning all four regular-season meetings. Mitchell had his best game of the young season, with seven assists and five rebounds after failing to score 20 points in Utah's first three games. He said he was ""110 percent"" frustrated after not playing as well as he'd liked in the last three games. ""Not so much from a scoring aspect, just because I wasn't making the plays that I need to make,"" he said. The Jazz had a 15-point lead early in the fourth after scoring the first six points of the quarter. Houston got going after that, scoring the next seven points, with the first four from Clint Capela and a 3 from Anthony to make it 81-75 with about nine minutes left. Mitchell hit a 3-pointer with less than eight minutes to go to leave the Jazz up by nine. Harden re-entered the game soon after that and made a jump shot after a steal by P.J. Tucker. Tucker grabbed another steal on the next possession and dished it to Harden, who found Capela ahead of the defense for a slam dunk that cut the lead to 84-79 and had Jazz coach Quin Snyder calling for a timeout as Harden implored the crowd to get louder. The Jazz led by eight at halftime after holding Houston to just 15 points in the second quarter and had pushed the lead to 16 midway through the third after a 3-pointer by Joe Ingles. Utah was up 75-66 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Jazz: Raul Neto missed his fourth straight game with a hamstring injury. ... Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 13 rebounds. ... Ingles added 11 points. Rockets: Centers Nene (right calf tightness) and Zhou Qi (left knee sprain), and forward Marquese Chriss (left ankle sprain) did not play. ... Anthony hadn't scored more than nine points in any of the first three games. WHAT A TEAMMATE Paul's suspension came because of an altercation he had with Rajon Rondo after Paul said the Lakers guard spit at him. On Tuesday night Rondo did an interview with ESPN where he called Paul a ""horrible teammate."" Harden said he hadn't heard about Rondo's comments when asked after the game but shared his thoughts on playing with the nine-time All-Star. ""I think he's a pretty cool teammate to me,"" Harden said. ""Pretty cool guy to be around. For real.""","401070738"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers nearly made Spurs coach Gregg Popovich ill. Oladipo had 21 points, Indiana had 34 assists and the Pacers led for all but the opening seconds in a 116-96 victory over San Antonio on Wednesday night. Popovich joked before the game that San Antonio's defense might land him in the emergency room. Oladipo and the sharp-shooting Pacers had no trouble finding space to fire away. ""We moved the ball,"" Oladipo said. ""I think when we move the ball, it kind of translates to being in unison and being together on the defensive end as well. When everybody feels good, everybody's touching (the ball), everybody wants to defend."" The Pacers limited the Spurs to 6-for-19 shooting on 3-pointers while leading by as many as 29 points. Defense has been the foundation of San Antonio's five NBA Championships and 21 straight postseason appearances, but they are struggling to maintain that consistency with an overhauled roster. ""We have a lot of work to do on both ends of the court, and we know that, especially defensively,"" Popovich said. ""We're defensively challenged, so to speak. Until we figure it out, there's a lot of habits that have to be formed."" Seven Pacers scored in double figures, including 19 points by Tyreke Evans and 16 by Domantas Sabonis. Oladipo led the team with nine assists, and nine others had at least one. ""When you have that type of ball movement, you're hitting guys and you're making the defense work and you're playing to your third and fourth option,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""A lot of times, you're going to get some open looks, and they can shoot the ball when they're open."" DeMar DeRozan had 18 points to lead the Spurs, his lowest total since joining the team in an offseason trade from Toronto. Marco Belinelli added 16 points and LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes had 15 each. DeRozan said the Spurs are still adapting to one another. ""Communication thing, understanding spots, understanding tendencies, understanding terminology,"" DeRozan said of what the team needs to work on. ""It's kind of a little bit of everything. It's a new group, we still haven't gotten rolling offensively like we want, and defensively as well. So, once we get both them two things clicking, we're going to be all right."" The Pacers dominated with a strong combination of inside muscle and outside shooting. Indiana shot 53 percent on 3-pointers, opening the game 9 for 11 on 3s. Sabonis also had a monstrous dunk against Spurs forward Davis Bertans early in the second quarter, winding up and dunking with his left hand around the reach of a leaping Bertans. The Spurs only lead came when Rudy Gay scored the game's opening points on an 11-foot fadeaway jumper. Gay finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana entered the game second in the NBA by shooting 43 percent on 3-pointers. ... The Pacers held an opponent under 100 points for the second time this season. Spurs: Forbes is the first starting point guard for the Spurs other than Tony Parker to score in double figures in each of his first four games since Maurice Cheeks in 1989. ... The Spurs played their 1,700th game in San Antonio. They are 1,270-429 at home, which is the best home record of any team in league history. EASY CHOICE Popovich had high praise for McMillan, who will be one of his assistants when the Spurs' veteran coach leads Team USA. ""He's a class act from top to bottom,"" Popovich said of McMillan. ""He's knowledgeable, he's really experienced in USA Basketball, he's got great demeanor, he's very, very well respected and ... I think that's enough. I think those are all pretty good reasons why I was hoping he would agree to do it, so, I was thrilled when he decided he would do it."" STILL EARLY Oladipo is not reading too much into the Spurs' early struggles defensively. ""It's a new year,"" Oladipo said. ""It's only the fourth, fifth game of the year. So, you as a media, you've got to kind of analyze all that, but them as players and coaching staff, they've just got to keep getting better and they'll be fine.""","401070739"
"MILWAUKEE --  After a cold start, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks offense again roared to life, including a near-record output in the second quarter. Before celebrating the scoring outburst, coach Mike Budenholzer wanted to talk about his team's second-half defense after a 123-108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. After surrendering 64 first-half points, Milwaukee's defense buckled down in the second half, holding the 76ers to 44 points, including 17 in the third quarter. ""We've got to have our defense there no matter what we are doing on the other end,"" Budenholzer said. ""When you do that, you can keep a lead and maybe build a lead."" Eric Bledsoe said the turnaround stemmed from paying greater attention to the defensive game plan. ""I thought we did a poor job in the first half,"" Bledsoe said. ""We locked in during the second half."" Antetokounmpo had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Bucks, who improved to 4-0 for the first time since the 2001-02 season. Antetokounmpo downplayed his performance. ""I feel like I can be way better and help my teammates find open shots even more and I'm going to keep trying to get better,"" he said. Khris Middleton had 25 points, and Brook Lopez chipped in 21. Joel Embiid scored 30 points for Philadelphia, which was coming off a wild 133-132 overtime loss Tuesday at Detroit. JJ Redick added 19 points for the 76ers, who fell to 2-3. The Bucks overcame early ice-cold shooting before gradually taking control. Lopez misfired on his first four 3-point attempts but then sank five straight to spark a second-quarter rally. ""We all came out and struggled a little bit shooting it, but we have to stick with it,"" Lopez said. Antetokounmpo had a message for Lopez after the early misses. ""Keep shooting. That's what I told him, personally,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I heard everybody tell him to keep shooting. We don't want Embiid staying in the paint all night. He's not going to give us driving lanes. He made some shots and the paint opened up."" Lopez's shooting helped propel the Bucks to 49 second-quarter points, four shy of the team record for a quarter. ""You have to pick your poison and figure out what you can live with,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""You can't have it all. Give him credit, he made those shots. It was hard to overcome that many points in the second period."" The Bucks led by eight during the second quarter and held a 71-64 advantage at the break. Middleton had 20 first-half points, and Redick had 16. Milwaukee stretched the lead to 15 during the third quarter and held a 92-81 advantage heading to the fourth. The Bucks poured it on in the final period, building a 16-point lead midway through. The 76ers pulled within eight late, but a pair of free throws by Antetokounmpo and a driving, one-handed scoop layup by Eric Bledsoe quickly pushed the lead to 12. The 76ers held a 34-22 lead after one quarter by making 6 of 8 from 3-point range, with five players sinking shots from deep. The Bucks made just 1 of 11 3s and shot 23 percent overall, trailing by 14 at one point. The Bucks finished 13 for 43 from long range for the game. FAST PACE The Bucks have pushed the pace on offense under first-year coach Budenholzer, which left Antetokounmpo with his hands on his knees on a few occasions. ""We play fast. I was a little bit out of breath,"" he said. ""I've got to get in shape.""

"PHOENIX --  In his fourth game, LeBron James finally got his first victory as a Los Angeles Laker. James flirted with what would have been his 74th career triple-double, finishing with 19 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds before sitting out the fourth quarter of a 131-113 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. ""It feels great,"" he said. ""It is a win, period, but it feels good to know what we have been doing over training camp and these first few games to continue to get better."" Lance Stephenson had 23 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, JaVale McGee added 20 points and Kyle Kuzma had 17 for the Lakers. They had seven players in double figures. The Suns' Devin Booker had 23 points, seven rebounds and seven assists but left the game in the third quarter with a strained left hamstring.  Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick this year, had 22 points and 11 rebounds. Los Angeles was without Rajon Rondo and Brandon Ingram for their roles in an altercation with the Houston Rockets on Saturday night. Wednesday night was the first of a three-game suspension for Rondo and a four-game suspension for Ingram. But the Lakers didn't miss them in this one, blowing it open with a 44-point second quarter. Neither team led by more than six points in the first quarter and the Suns were down only 46-41 after Isaiah Canaan's driving layup with 7:09 left in the half. But Phoenix committed four turnovers in a 17-2 Los Angeles outburst that put the Lakers up 63-43 on Josh Hart's running dunk with 3:51 left in the first half. ""That is what we keep harping on. That is what we will continue to harp on throughout the season is our defensive approach,"" James said. ""How we approach the game, our physicality, our communication and that is what we did in the second quarter."" Los Angeles outscored the Suns 44-24 in the second quarter. ""Our defense picked up,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""To start the game our defense was soft. They missed some shots but that was the same thing that happened against San Antonio, but they made shots. We need to get better at that. We need to start games with the same mentality that we started the second quarter."" Phoenix committed eight turnovers in the second quarter, resulting in 15 Lakers points. ""In the first quarter we had a defensive presence,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We had a couple good defensive possessions and showed some kind of resistance defensively and we had a close game. But in the rest of the game, starting with the turnovers, we were thinking too much."" The Lakers led 76-54 at the break and Phoenix never got closer than 16 in the third quarter. ""The Lakers are a good team,"" Kokoskov said. ""We were talking about this morning that we're not buying in their record right now. They're much better than the record is saying. But I'm not pleased with any part of game, including defense."" TIP-INS Lakers: James has five fewer triple-doubles than Wilt Chamberlain.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Dave Joerger's young Kings team had another night of silly mistakes, broken plays and missed assignments. This time Sacramento played through the trouble and won. De'Aaron Fox scored 21 points, including a leaning, one-handed dunk as part of a pivotal run late in the fourth quarter, and the Kings beat the Memphis Grizzlies 97-92 on Wednesday. Sacramento won despite 17 turnovers, two coming in the final minute when the Kings failed to advance the ball past midcourt before the eight-second limit and later couldn't get the ball inbounds in time. ""We made a lot, a lot of mistakes, but we just kept coming and coming and coming,"" Joerger said. ""We overcame those mistakes with our effort. They believe that if we play fast we have a chance."" Buddy Hield had 23 points, Willie Cauley-Stein added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Nemanja Bjelica had 11 points and 11 boards for the Kings. Fox scored 10 in the third quarter to help Sacramento erase an eight-point deficit, but made only one basket over the final 17 minutes. It was an impressive one. After Bjelica stole the ball near midcourt, a sprinting Fox took the pass and dunked left-handed over Memphis center Marc Gasol. Fox's jam brought the Golden1 Center crowd to its feet and sparked a 14-4 run that put the Kings up for good. ""I was hoping he'd jump, but that's Marc's game -- he doesn't go up to block shots,"" Fox said. ""I missed a few layups yesterday and today, so it was like, go do something that's a for-sure bucket."" Gasol exited with 5:54 remaining due to an undisclosed injury and walked into the locker room with a large bag of ice around his neck. He finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Mike Conley scored 27 points, and Jaren Jackson had 14 points and seven rebounds for Memphis. Wayne Selden added 13 points. The Grizzlies were coming off consecutive impressive wins over Atlanta and Utah following a season-opening, 28-point loss to Indiana. Memphis led by 14 in the first half but was held to 19 points in the third quarter and 21 in the fourth. ""We didn't come out with the same level of grit in the second half that we did to start the game,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We're still learning how to be on the same page. It's the main thing for us."" Gasol scored five points and Selden and Omri Casspi came off the bench to make 3-pointers as part of a 15-5 run to close out the first quarter. The Grizzlies led by 14 midway through the second before the Kings made a late run of their own to pull to 52-44 at halftime. Sacramento led 95-86 late in the fourth before Memphis took advantage of the Kings' carelessness and made it close. ""Our ability to learn on the fly is impressive for how young we are,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""So yeah, it is going to be chaotic and we're going to make really dumb mistakes, but we push the pace so much we're going to get those possessions back."" BOARDING UP The Kings outrebounded the Grizzlies and had a 15-13 edge on the offensive end. BIG SHOT BUDDY Hield shot 10 of 20 and made a key 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. He also followed Fox's dunk with one of his own. ""The guy's spirit is so pure,"" Joerger said. ""He just keeps competing and all of a sudden, bang, bang, gets two shots to go in and things look a lot different."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Chandler Parsons did not play because of right knee soreness. Kings: Marvin Bagley III had 13 points and six rebounds. The second overall pick in the draft continues to come off the bench for Joerger's squad. ... Iman Shumpert was held out with a sore left hip. Shumpert started the previous two games. ... Justin Jackson started at small forward in place of Shumpert.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry pulled one from Michael Jordan's old celebratory playbook and shrugged like no big deal whatsoever. Nah, not at all. Just another 3-pointer from way downtown. Curry grinned as he kept lighting up the floor, scoring 51 points and finishing with 11 3-pointers in only three quarters of the Golden State Warriors' 144-122 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. ""The last 3 in the first quarter was probably the funniest thing I've experienced on the court. Two guys on our team are yelling at the time from the time I was at the free throw line: `Don't pass it! Don't pass it! You better shoot it!' All that type of stuff,"" Curry said. ""That's going through my head while I'm dribbling down. That's kind of all the motivation you need just to launch it. Thankfully it went in."" Coach Steve Kerr couldn't even be upset when his superstar let it fly from any distance he desired: ""You got a guy taking 40-footers and you're on the sideline going, `Yeah, that's a good shot,"" Kerr said. Kevin Durant added 30 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, and Draymond Green had 11 of his 12 assists in the first half to help two-time defending champions finish with 37 after dishing out 35 assists in a 20-point victory against Phoenix on Monday. But this was all Curry's show. No. 30 knocked down his 11th 3 of the night late in the third from 32 feet back. ""It's just one of those nights you just have so much fun playing the game,"" Curry said. ""Taking some dare shots and trying to sustain that for as long as I'm out there on the floor."" He scored 31 in the first half, finished with his sixth career 50-point game and made 10 or more 3s for the 10th time. The 51 points matched his most at Oracle Arena. Curry hit his first five 3-pointers then after his fifth one drove to the basket and was fouled. He made two free throws to chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" The two-time winner of the award had the ninth 30-point half of his career and fourth at home. ""It was a joy to be on the same court with that. That was sick,"" Durant said. The ""MVP!"" cheers continued. Curry shot 15 for 24, 11 of 16 from 3-point range and made all 10 free throws, missing his career high of 54 set in February 2013 by three points. ""He was, I don't even know how to describe what I witnessed tonight, amazing, video-game stuff,"" Kerr said. ""... Some of the shooting was just mind-boggling. Nobody's ever done what he's doing, pulling up from I don't know, 32."" Curry has scored 30 or more points in four of the first five games and had 29 on Monday against Phoenix, also playing just three quarters. He has hit at least five 3-pointers in each game so far. Bradley Beal bruised his sternum early then returned late in the first half and wound up with 23 points. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 17 points off the bench for Washington. Beal said he took an elbow from Durant. X-rays were negative. ""Breathing was a little messed up and it felt like my rib was out of place,"" Beal said. ""It hurts but I'll be OK.""

Five members of the team attended morning shootaround then Hall of Famer Rick Barry joined the group for the game. Six players and assistant coach Joe Roberts took turns hoisting the trophy during a ceremony before the second quarter. Coach Al Attles wasn't in attendance as originally planned because he wasn't feeling well. Golden State sported gold throwback jerseys for the occasion. THOMPSON'S TOUCH Klay Thompson missed his first three 3-point tries before connecting with 6:36 left in the third and scored 19 points. Thompson is 4 for 27 from long range through the initial five games. ""One thing I love about Klay is he's going to shoot his way out of anything,"" Kerr said.","401070743"
"DETROIT --  Dwane Casey has coached Detroit to its best start in a decade. He's also well aware the Pistons have a long way to go. ""It's good for our team, good for our morale, but we know that there's bigger mountains to climb down the road,"" said Casey, who was hired to coach the Pistons this past offseason. ""We've just got to continue to work and improve and get better in certain areas."" Andre Drummond had 26 points and 22 rebounds, and the Pistons remained unbeaten with a 110-103 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday night. Detroit is 4-0 for the first time since the 2008-09 season. Cleveland, which was without injured star Kevin Love, fell to 0-5 for the first time since 2003-04, when LeBron James was a rookie. Blake Griffin scored 26 points in his first game since a 50-point night against Philadelphia on Tuesday. Reggie Jackson added 16 points for the Pistons. Kyle Korver led Cleveland with 21 points. ""As competitors we want to win, but I thought there was some good out there tonight,"" Korver said. ""I thought we were playing with more energy, we passed the ball earlier in the shot clock, kept things going in motion, scrapped on defense, but it's hard to win in the NBA."" The Pistons scored the first six points of the game before the Cavaliers scored the next 11. Detroit went on a 12-0 run late in the second quarter and led 58-50 at halftime. Drummond  -- who was ejected in the win over the 76ers --  had 20 points and 20 rebounds through three quarters against Cleveland. The Pistons were up 12 heading into the fourth. The Cavaliers cut the margin to six with 49 seconds left in the fourth when Korver made a 3-pointer while being fouled for a four-point play. Detroit was able to close the game out after that. The Pistons have won their four games by a combined 13 points, and they haven't played too tough a schedule. Three of the victories were against the Nets, Bulls and Cavaliers. Detroit's next two games are against the Celtics. ""We can't get too excited,"" Drummond said. ""It's still early in the season, and we have a lot of games to go. So we've got to take them win by win and game by game and just keep getting better."" INJURIES Love missed the game with a sore left foot, and Detroit lost Luke Kennard to a right shoulder injury after a Cleveland player set a screen on him in the second quarter. Casey said Kennard may have a sprain, and the team should know more Friday. IN RESERVE Korver was one of four Cleveland backups who scored in double figures. ""Thought our bench was great all night -- even in the first half, I thought they did a great job,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Then coming back in the second half, I thought Kyle got going, Larry (Nance Jr.) was good. J.R. (Smith) was missing shots, but I liked his competing against Blake, fronting the post, got a couple steals and deflections."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's starting backcourt of George Hill and Rodney Hood had no assists Wednesday against Brooklyn . Those two combined for just one assist against Detroit. Pistons: Jackson reached the 2,000-assist mark early in the first quarter, but he got in foul trouble and played only 6:16 in the first half. ... Detroit had 20 turnovers to Cleveland's nine, which snapped a 72-game streak in which the Pistons had forced at least 10 turnovers in each game.","401070744"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Damian Lillard struggled in the first half then was back in All-Star form after halftime. Lillard scored 34 of his 41 points in the second half, and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Orlando Magic 128-114 on Thursday night. CJ McCollum had 22 for the Trail Blazers and Jusuf Nurkic added 18 points and 10 rebounds. Lillard was just 2 for 8 in the first half, then hit 11 of 15 shots in the final two quarters, going 5 of 8 from 3-point territory. He sat out the first four minutes of the final quarter and watched a 13-point lead shrink to just 102-99. ""It's not really about filling up the stat sheet,"" Lillard said. ""There are opportunities to do it but I think it is more about impacting the game. Even when I am not making shots, I focus on how can I still impact the game."" Lillard and McCollum then re-entered with 7:54 left after Orlando cut a 13-point deficit to just 102-99 on Gordon's second 3-pointer of the quarter. The guards combined to score 22 of Portland's final 26 points to seal the win. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Terrence Ross had 21 points off the bench and Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier had 17 apiece. The Magic shot 50 percent from the field and made 12 3-pointers, but never could find a way to stop Portland. ""If you look at the offensive numbers, you ought to win this game,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""But the biggest thing tonight was our defense. It started with the first five minutes when we made mistake after mistake. We just weren't good."" Lillard had 19 points in the third quarter, including 11 of the Blazers' last 13. Magic guards D.J. Augustin and Jerian Grant chased him around the perimeter and into the lane, but never could catch him. He had three 3-pointers and five driving layups, before taking a break to start the fourth quarter. However, Portland couldn't shake the Magic, who trailed 91-80 going to the fourth period. But after Orlando cut it to three, Lillard and McCollum combined for eight straight points and Portland was back in front 110-99. Backup center Zach Collins had 13 points in nine minutes to help the Blazers to a 58-48 halftime lead. He helped the Blazers overcome a slow start by Lillard (2 for 8) and McCollum (foul trouble). Ross kept the Magic within striking distance with 12 points on 5-for-7 shooting. The Magic kept pace offensively, but were a step slow at the defensive end and Portland beat them to the basket repeatedly. TIP-INS TRAIL BLAZERS: Lillard's 41 points were the most ever scored by a Portland player against Orlando. . Collins hit all five field goal attempts in the first half, including a pair of 3-pointers. MAGIC: Orlando never led in the game after never trailing in the last game, a 93-90 win over Boston. . Vucevic has scored 25 or more points in five of his last seven games against Portland. PACE OF PLAY The NBA season is only a week old, but Portland coach Terry Stotts and Clifford have noticed the same thing. ""Right now the pace of games is off the charts,"" Stotts said. ""Teams are definitely playing faster,"" Clifford added. The scoring average for the NBA is up seven points from last season -- 113.4 so far from 106.3. Neither coach was sure how long it would last. ""It's hard to gauge after four or five games, but guys are pushing the ball up the floor,"" Clifford said. ""I think all of us coaches are interested in seeing what's going to happen 15-20 games in."" Said Stotts: ""It's hard to say it's a trend after one week, but it is a reality right now. I think it's fun. I like offensive basketball, but check back with me in January.""","401070745"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Kyrie Irving was overthinking how to fit in. He missed last season's playoffs after left knee surgery, and because the Boston Celtics reached the Eastern Conference finals without him, he was cautious when he returned this season. Once he relaxed and started having fun, everything flowed. Jayson Tatum scored 24 points, Irving had 15 points and five assists, and the Celtics rallied from a 16-point halftime deficit to beat the winless Oklahoma City Thunder 101-95 on Thursday night. ""When we're not on the same page, we're very, very bad,"" Irving said. ""I think we want to err on the side of being one and being together and playing well together. It's just a lot better basketball that way. And it starts with me, too."" Marcus Morris added 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Al Horford added 19 points for the Celtics.

Russell Westbrook had 13 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, but he shot 5 for 20. Oklahoma City led 50-34 at halftime. Boston shot just 32 percent in the first half and missed all 11 of its 3-point attempts. Boston hit seven of its first 10 3-pointers in the third quarter to trim Oklahoma City's lead to 70-64. At one point, Horford hit three 3-pointers in 41 seconds. ""It felt really good,"" Horford said. ""Before the second quarter ended, Kyrie looked at me and said, `Hey, we've got to set the tone. We have to be more aggressive.' He was right. We started in the third (quarter) and I tried to do my part and just play with more freedom out there.""

"LOS ANGELES --  When Kobe Bryant took a courtside seat in the first quarter, Staples Center buzzed with excitement for the mere sight of the most popular athlete in this building's history. The crowd even started a ""Kobe! Kobe!"" chant in the fourth quarter -- and it was immediately drowned out by cheers when LeBron James hit a 3-pointer. With the symbol of the Los Angeles Lakers' past watching in approval, James and the Lakers' young core proved that their present and future is pretty tantalizing, too. James had 28 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds while leading a late rally for his first home victory with the Lakers, 128-111 over the previously unbeaten Denver Nuggets on Thursday night. LeBron and Kobe didn't get a chance to talk, but the longtime friendly rivals likely both left happy with the Lakers' new direction after James' first triple-double for LA. ""Of course I noticed him sitting right on the baseline over there,"" James said. ""One of the all-time Laker greats. What he's done for this franchise in his 20-plus years here speaks wonders for me. To be able to compete against him all those years, and for me to be able to share a jersey, the same jersey as him at this point, is pretty special."" With Bryant in attendance for the first time since LeBron's arrival in LA, Kyle Kuzma scored 22 points and JaVale McGee added 21 to complement James' 74th career triple-double. But the result was even more impressive: The Lakers trailed by eight points with six minutes left in the fourth quarter before Lance Stephenson, who finished with 12 points, started a 15-2 rally with back-to-back 3-pointers. ""The first couple of games, when we fell behind, we stayed behind,"" James said. ""Tonight when we fell behind, we learned from our mistakes, and that's one of the most important things in life."" James got Staples Center rocking on a go-ahead dunk with 3:31 to play before Lonzo Ball made an artful step-back 3-pointer. Kuzma added two huge dunks down the stretch of Los Angeles' second win in two days after an 0-3 start. ""LeBron is doing what he always does,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""And LeBron is bringing all those guys their confidence way up. You're seeing Kyle Kuzma and LeBron, their chemistry growing."" Nikola Jokic scored 24 points for the Nuggets, who were off to their best start since the 2009-10 season. Jamal Murray scored 22 points and Monte Morris had 20, but Denver couldn't answer the Lakers' rally led by James, who posted his third career triple-double in Staples Center for his third different team. ""We just came out on the short end today, but we've got a couple of days off to revamp ourselves,"" said Morris, who added seven assists in just his eighth NBA game. One night after earning their first win of the LeBron era in Phoenix, the Lakers beat the Nuggets at Staples for the fourth straight time.

The compact guard finished last season with the Lakers, averaging 15.6 points in 17 games after getting traded by James' Cavaliers. ... Will Barton missed his third straight game with a hip injury. Lakers: Rookie Svi Mykhailiuk had four points. The Ukrainian guard scored his first NBA points one night earlier in Phoenix. ... Fans near courtside besides Bryant included actor Michael B.

KOBE'S HOUSE Bryant sat with Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, his former agent, in a rare visit since the 20-year Lakers veteran retired in 2016. Bryant spoke to a group of season ticket holders before the game about his forthcoming book. ""That's one of my favorite players,"" a visibly excited Stephenson said afterward. ""He was like, `Good game,' after the game, so I was a little hyped."" LANCE BOILS Stephenson provided an enormous boost for the Lakers on both ends of the court, in his usual inimitable style. The veteran said he came off the bench with a specific plan in mind: ""Aggressive defense, and attack the big man (Jokic). We felt like their big man couldn't match our intensity, so when I got in there, I was like, `Man, I'm going to attack the big man.""","401070747"
"The Hornets were feeling it to close the half, going on in 18-4 run vs. the Bulls en route to a 45-point second quarter. (0:22) CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Hornets coach James Borrego told Kemba Walker he wants him to lead the NBA in 3-point attempts. When asked his reaction, Walker broke into the widest smile he could muster, saying ""that's what I want to hear."" Walker had 30 points on five more 3-pointers, and Charlotte beat the Chicago Bulls 135-106 on Friday night for their first home victory of the season. Through six games, the two-time All-Star in second in the league in 3-point attempts (64) and 3-pointers made (29) behind only Golden State's Stephen Curry, who is setting the pace at 39 of 74 from beyond the arc. Walker finished fourth in the league last season with 241 3-pointers. Curry was ninth, but largely because he missed 31 games due to injuries. ""We trust his three,"" Borrego said. ""The way he's shooting it, the confidence, the spacing around him, the movement around him, we expect those 3s to keep him in (Curry's) area. And if we can get more, I want more. It's my job to help him find more 3s and to create more 3s. We don't want this to decline. If anything, we want this to increase."" Walker, who came in averaging 31 points, bounced back from a season-low 23-point outing against the Bulls, shooting 11 of 18 from the field. He also had seven assists and six rebounds. ""It just feels good when I'm shooting,"" said Walker, who is shooting 3s at a career-best 45 percent clip. ""I want to keep it up. I want to get them up. That's just the way the game is now. For us to win we have to get some threes up and make them at a high-percentage and I want to be the one to lead that."" Zach LaVine had 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting for the Bulls. TIP INS Bulls: Kris Dunn (knee), Lauri Markkanen (elbow), Denzel Valentine (ankle) and Bobby Portis missed the game with injuries. ""I know we are throwing a lot of makeshift lines out there, but it is not an excuse to not go out there and play hard,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg.  ... Were outrebounded 50-34.

He accomplished the feat Saturday night at Miami during a four-game trip. ... Shot 57 percent from the field. ... Four of next five games are at home. PARKER STEPS UP Tony Parker, in his first season with the Hornets, is excelling off the bench. He added 18 points and eight assists as Charlotte avenged a two-point loss in Chicago on Wednesday night. Hoiberg felt Parker was the one who turned the game around in Charlotte's 45-point second quarter. ""He had a couple of answer backs, got to the middle of the floor, got to his right hand and went through our gaps early in the possession and he got right to the rim on us,"" Hoiberg said. ""That took the lid off, they got confident and then they got going."" BRIDGING THE GAP The Hornets are getting solid play out of rookie forward Miles Bridges, who had 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting to go along with five rebounds and two steals. ""I'm getting more confidence with Miles Bridges every single night and every single day,"" Borrego said. ""He's doing his job at a high level.  He wants to get better.  He cares about getting better.  He's coachable. He plays hard and I need him to get better every single night."" SLOW START, FAST FINISH After missing their first 11 3-pointers of the game, the Hornets went on a tear, making the final 14 of 22 shots from beyond the arc. ""We just brought a lot more energy,"" Bridges said. ""We wanted to focus more on the defensive end, we just put an emphasis on defense and that's what really got us there.""","401070748"
"NEW YORK --  If this is what Kevin Durant can do at Madison Square Garden, no wonder Knicks fans are so desperate for him to come to New York. This kind of show was worth seeing more than once a season. Durant scored 25 of his 41 points in Golden State's ruthless fourth-quarter clinic, and the Warriors beat the Knicks 128-100 on Friday night. Durant was the center of attention leading into the game and then the star of it in front of fans who hope he will consider the Knicks if he becomes a free agent this summer. He's not interested in the off-the-court stuff right now, but he loved what happened on the floor in his 10-for-13 final quarter. ""It feels like when you catch every green light when you're going somewhere,"" Durant said. New York led by three after three quarters before Durant and the Warriors starting hitting from all over the floor, making 19 of 26 shots -- and things went so well that on a rare long-range miss by Durant, the ball bounced all the way out behind the arc to a wide-open Stephen Curry, who made the 3-pointer. Asked what changed in the fourth quarter, when Golden State outscored New York 47-16, Knicks coach David Fizdale said: ""Kevin Durant."" Curry added 29 points and six 3-pointers, giving him at least five in every game this season. But on the floor where he scored a career-best 54 points in 2013, his performance seemed almost quiet because of Durant. He finished 17 of 24 from the floor, including 5 of 9 from behind the arc -- where one of the misses was a one-legged attempt. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 24 points for the Knicks, who have dropped five in a row after a season-opening victory over Atlanta. Fizdale changed up his starting lineup, going with Hardaway, Frank Ntilikina, Noah Vonleh, Damyean Dotson and rookie Mitchell Robinson, and the group provided a 16-10 lead. But it was quickly wiped out mostly by Curry, who made his first five shots, with three of them behind the arc. Durant drew plenty of notice upon his arrival and a loud ovation when he was announced with the starting lineups. He can become a free agent after this season and Knicks fans hope he can speed up their rebuilding. A billboard urging him to come to New York popped up on a building near Madison Square Garden this week. Curry said it's not a distraction, saying the Warriors have faced greater concerns during their run of three championships in the last four years. ""The way he's handled it, obviously letting his play speak for itself and not getting too wrapped up or involved in it, understanding we've got seven more months of this,"" Curry said. ""So we know how to keep distractions out of our locker room and just play basketball and enjoy what we do."" TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State visits the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. It's the first time the Warriors have played the two New York teams on the same trip. ... Draymond Green scored 18 points. Knicks: New York has lost the last nine meetings. ... Ntilikina scored 17 points and Trey Burke, the former starting point guard, had 15. BYE, BOOGIE DeMarcus Cousins isn't even playing for Golden State yet and he's been ejected from a game. The volatile center was sitting in street clothes for arguing with referee Scott Foster in the first quarter. As play resumed following a timeout with 2:28 remaining in the first quarter, it was announced that Cousins had been assessed a technical foul during the break, and then subsequently ejected. Cousins is still recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon. He took part in his first practice with the Warriors on Thursday, but there is still no timetable for his return to action. FEAR FACTOR Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who has been outspoken about President Donald Trump and gun violence, was asked if was concerned for his own safety in the wake of the mail bombs sent to prominent Democrats. ""A little bit, yeah,"" Kerr said. ""I think we should all be concerned. No matter who you are you need to be concerned, not just of the bombs, but just somebody shooting you,"" adding it was a ""dangerous time to be alive right now"" in the U.S. Kerr's father, Malcolm Kerr, a professor who served as president of the American University of Beirut, was shot and killed outside his office in the war-torn Lebanese capital in 1984.","401070749"
"TORONTO --  With a strong start and a big finish, Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors added to their perfect start. Lowry had 20 points and 12 assists, Kawhi Leonard scored 21 points and Toronto set a franchise record with its sixth straight win to start the season, beating the Dallas Mavericks 116-107 on Friday night. Jonas Valanciunas scored 17 points, Danny Green had 15 and Serge Ibaka finished with 11 as the Raptors eclipsed the 5-0 start they recorded in 2015-16. DeAndre Jordan had 18 points and 15 rebounds for the Mavericks, who trailed by 17 points in the first quarter. Luka Doncic scored 22 points, and Wesley Matthews had 21. Jordan struggled to find a family friendly way to describe Dallas' poor showing in the first. ""Our defense to start the game has been ... what's a G-rated word? Terrible,"" he said. Dallas clawed back and trailed by three heading into the fourth, but Toronto opened the quarter with a 9-2 run. Dallas shot 7 for 24 in the fourth. ""We just didn't compete at the same level they did down the stretch,"" Mavs forward Harrison Barnes said. ""That's what the big difference was."" Lowry, who didn't turn the ball over, recorded 10 or more assists for a career-best fourth straight game. He's the first Raptors player to accomplish the feat since Jose Calderon had five in a row in March 2012. ""He's really good,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""Each year that goes by, he starts being able to pick out things and see it more clearly."" Nurse replaced Dwane Casey last summer. He is staying focused during Toronto's solid start. ""I'm not getting too far down the road,"" Nurse said. Dallas, which let a 26-point lead slip away in Wednesday's loss at Atlanta, dropped its second straight after winning two in a row. ""We did a lot of good things tonight but we obviously have some things to clean up,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. Green scored 12 points in the first as the Raptors raced out to an 18-2 lead. Toronto led 39-26 after its highest-scoring quarter of the season so far. Matthews scored nine points in the second and Doncic had eight as Dallas cut the deficit to five late in the quarter. Leonard scored nine points for the Raptors and Lowry had eight to help Toronto to a 69-60 lead at halftime. BARNES BACK Barnes made his season debut after missing the first four games because of a strained right hamstring. He shot 5 for 17 and scored 14 points. ""He gives us a dimension that we desperately need so it's great to have him back out there,"" Carlisle said. ALL IN THE FAMILY Jordan arrived for the game dressed in a replica of the No. 58 jersey his brother Avery Jordan wears as an offensive lineman for the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the Canadian Football League. Hamilton is about 40 miles west of Toronto. Jordan said he watches his brother's games on television but has been unable to attend one in person. TIP-INS Mavericks: Jordan led Dallas with five assists. ... Dallas missed nine of its first 10 field-goal attempts, and then made eight of the next 12. ... Mavs rookie Jalen Brunson is the son of former Raptors guard and nine-year NBA veteran Rick Brunson. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (sprained left big toe) missed his second straight game. ... G Delon Wright (left thigh) sat for the fifth time in six games. ... F OG Anunoby (personal reason) was inactive. ... Toronto has allowed at least 100 points in all six games this season. ...

"HOUSTON --  Five games into the season is too early for the Houston Rockets to panic about their bad start. So they are keeping their cool -- for now. ""All in all, we've got to get better in all aspects of it,"" Chris Paul said. ""We've just got to figure it out. Luckily, it's early."" Montrezl Harrell scored a career-high 30 points off the bench to help the Los Angeles Clippers rout short-handed Houston 133-113 on Friday night. It was the Clippers' second win this season over the Rockets, who played without James Harden due to a hamstring injury and dropped to 1-4. Harrell, who was drafted by the Rockets in 2015, was one of six Clippers who scored in double figures. ""He was good last year and what we found in the second half (of last year) what no one knew was that he could score, because he hadn't done it yet in the NBA,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""That's why practices are so important and every day in practice he's scoring, and we start thinking maybe this guy can score, and he's proven that he can."" Lou Williams, another former Rocket, had 23 points for Los Angeles off the bench, and Danilo Gallinari scored 16. Los Angeles scored the first 11 points of the fourth quarter to make it 107-83 and put the game out of reach. Rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the 11th overall pick in the draft, had seven points in that stretch for the Clippers. Carmelo Anthony scored a season-high 24 points in his first start for the Rockets, who were also without starter James Ennis. Anthony, who is in his first season in Houston after one difficult year in Oklahoma City, doesn't know why the Rockets have struggled with consistency this season. ""I can't really pinpoint it at this point right now,"" he said. ""We're still all trying to just figure it out. I know we keep saying that it's early but there's some things we have to figure out quickly just to try to get this thing rolling."" Paul had 12 points and eight assists against his former team in his return after serving a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with Lakers guard Rajon Rondo. But his presence wasn't enough to make up for the absence of Harden, who will miss at least one more game after straining his left hamstring in a loss to Utah on Wednesday night. Houston didn't score in the fourth quarter until Anthony made the second of two free throws with 8:41 left. The Rockets opened the second half with an 11-3 run capped by a 3-pointer from P.J. Tucker, trimming the Clippers' lead to 73-72 with about eight minutes left in the third. But Los Angeles ripped off the next eight points, including 3-pointers by Tobias Harris and Avery Bradley, while Houston missed its next eight shots. Isaiah Hartenstein ended a three-minute Houston scoring drought on a dunk with about five minutes left, starting a 6-0 spurt that got the Rockets within three. TIP-INS Clippers: Harris got a technical in the second quarter for jawing at Anthony. ... The Clippers made 35 of 38 free-throw attempts. ... Bradley had 14 points. Rockets: Coach Mike D'Antoni received a technical in the first quarter for yelling at the officials after Harrell knocked Carter-Williams to the ground on a foul. ... C Nene is out for the foreseeable future because of a strained right calf. The center hasn't played this season because of the injury and general manager Daryl Morey said Thursday that he'll be out for at least two more weeks before being re-evaluated. ... Ennis will be re-evaluated after Houston's next game to see if he's healthy enough to play on the team's upcoming road trip. THEY SAID IT Tucker when asked about this team's defense compared to last season's team: ""It's a different team. It's not the same team. I hate talking about last year anymore because it's gone. It's not the same team so we have to figure it out."" NOT SO SWEET HOME The Rockets have had a difficult time at home this season, losing all three games by double digits after only losing three games at home by more than 10 points all last season. It's only the 14th time in NBA history that a team has dropped its first three games at home by double digits, according to STATS.","401070751"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  First-year coach Mike Budenholzer brought his heavy reliance on 3-pointers to the Milwaukee Bucks this season, transforming a team not known for its prowess from beyond the arc. The approach has taken hold and Milwaukee has tied the best start in franchise history. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 15 points and 12 rebounds in just 23 minutes, Ersan Ilyasova added 16 points off the bench and the Bucks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-95 on Friday night. Khris Middleton scored 16 points and hit four 3-pointers for Milwaukee, which is 5-0 for the second time in franchise history. The 1971-72 Bucks led by Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson started 7-0. Five players scored in double figures for Milwaukee, which made a season-high 19 3-pointers. ""It's been a complete turnaround,"" Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon said. ""Big part, credit to Bud. Not only do we have a great system that we play to advantage every night, our strengths, but he takes care of our bodies. We don't feel run down. We feel healthy, everybody's able to play."" Milwaukee entered the game with the ninth-best offensive rating in the NBA to go with the fourth-best defensive rating. The Bucks also entered shooting 40.8 3-pointers per game, up from last season's total of 24.7 per game. They had connected on 15.3 3s per game this season, the third-highest total in the league. Milwaukee hit just 8.8 per game last season. ""Tonight's exactly how we want to play,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think we did a great job moving the ball, playing hard. And especially, I think they scored like 16 points in the first quarter? We were playing hard defensively, and we were moving the ball offensively."" Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 16 points for a listless Minnesota squad dealing with the distraction of star Jimmy Butler's trade request. Butler started despite being questionable with an illness and had a season-low four points on 2-of-11 shooting. ""I think I was a lot like everybody else,"" Butler said, downplaying the illness. ""We let our offense dictate what our defense was going to bring. Me, speaking for myself, I can never let that happen. My entire career has been my defense dictates my offense. Bad one; it's behind me right now this second. Hopefully, it is for everybody else."" The specter of the trade request has lingered around the Wolves, but Butler had turned boos to cheers in leading Minnesota to wins in the first two home games. The boos were back on Friday as Milwaukee buried Minnesota from the 3-point line. The Wolves started 0 for 11 from the field and were scoreless until Butler scored with 7:19 left in the first quarter. Minnesota missed its first nine 3s and went 10 of 43 for the game. ""It was a combination of us missing our shots, and went down the other end and played low-energy defense,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You're required to do more than one thing and I thought our communication wasn't very good."" The Bucks were also cold early, going just 1 of 8 from 3-point range. But Milwaukee finished the half hitting nine of its next 15 3s to build a 25-point halftime lead. Antetokounmpo scored only five points in the first half but Middleton and Brodgon each had 13. ""It's coaching,"" Brogdon said. ""He treats Giannis the same way he treats the last guy on the bench. We have immense respect for him, everybody's bought into the system and we enjoy playing for him."" TIP-INS Bucks: G Matthew Dellavedova returned after missing one game with an illness. ... Antetokounmpo had his fifth double-double of the season but his lowest scoring output to this point. He added six assists. ... Milwaukee shot 46 3s, which tied a season high. Timberwolves: F Andrew Wiggins missed his second straight game with a bruised right quadriceps. ... With rookie Josh Okogie starting for Wiggins, it was the fourth different starting lineup for Minnesota this season. The Wolves used six different starting combinations last season, the fewest of any team in the league. ... Minnesota got 56 points from its bench, led by Derrick Rose with 14. ... New Minnesota Twins manager Rocco Baldelli threw out T-shirts to the crowd. PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL Former President Barack Obama was in Wisconsin on Friday and told a crowd in attendance at a rally that Antetokounmpo is ""balling."" Word got back to the Bucks before the game. ""It's amazing, a guy like Barack Obama mentioning my name and know what I'm doing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's a great thing."" NO DRAMA, JUST BUSINESS Butler downplayed any part of the off-court rumors affecting the team right now and said there is no drama. ""I don't consider anything drama,"" Butler said. ""I consider it business. It's part of it. I think everybody still wants to win, man. We had an off night. But if we win, everything's OK, everything's fine. You wouldn't be asking me the same question.""","401070752"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis demonstrated what a decisive, composed and efficient tandem they can be when an opponent suffers a last-minute lapse. Holiday highlighted a 26-point performance with a pull-up jumper near the foul line with 2 seconds left, Davis stole Brooklyn's last-gasp inbound pass, and the New Orleans Pelicans remained unbeaten by scoring nine straight over the last 1:49 in a 117-115 victory over the Nets on Friday night. ""Our chemistry is there,"" Holiday said, alluding to New Orleans' 4-0 start to the regular season. ""The way we're playing, I think we know after these last couple games that we can win in tough situations."" The Nets were clinging to a one-point lead and trying to run down the clock when D'Angelo Russell's pass intended for Caris LeVert sailed out of bounds with 7 seconds left. The crowd, which had been screaming nervously for New Orleans to stop the clock by fouling in the moments before the turnover, suddenly erupted into triumphant roars as the Pelicans -- who were out of timeouts -- quickly inbounded the ball and Holiday raced toward the key on the dribble for his go-ahead 17-footer. ""We know what that play is. It's either get the ball to Anthony or come off a screen and if you have a wide-open shot then it's a wide-open shot,"" Holiday said. ""Anthony attracts so many people when he rolls to the basket."" The Nets took a timeout, and that's when Brooklyn's Ed Davis was assessed a technical foul for shoving Solomon Hill away from the Nets' bench area, giving the Pelicans another free throw, which Holiday sank. ""I just learned from Jared Dudley,"" Hill said, referring to Brooklyn's veteran forward. ""I tried to look at their play and a guy put himself in a situation that he probably shouldn't have put himself in and things happen."" The Nets still had a chance until Anthony Davis leapt to tip Joe Harris' inbound pass to himself as time ran out. ""I was just trying to be all over the ball and try to make it tough for them,"" said Davis, who missed 13 of his 19 shots in an off night by his standards, but still finished with 18 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks. ""We just fought the entire game. It wasn't pretty."" Russell's late turnover marred a 24-point performance in which he hit six 3-pointers. ""It was all my fault,"" Russell said. ""We've got to be better, honestly. We focused 47 minutes and 36 seconds, and that other 20-some-odd seconds we wasn't focused. I wasn't focused. So that's where that mistake happened."" The Nets combined for 19 3s in all on 40 attempts, but they could have used one more when LeVert let it fly from deep with about 25 seconds left. It missed, Davis got the rebound, and Dudley purposely fouled Holiday with 21 seconds left and Brooklyn leading by three. Holiday made both free throws to pull the Pelicans to 115-114 and set up the dramatic finish. ""It's a shame because we played a heck of a game, and we didn't close it out when we had opportunities,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We had a lot of young mistakes out there, but we've just got to learn from it."" TIP-INS Nets: LeVert scored 21 points and Shabazz Napier added 16 points. ... The Nets had 26 assists. They have 20-plus assists in each of their five games so far. Pelicans: Elfrid Payton scored 17 points but left in the final minutes with a left leg cramp. ... Davis' fourth block of the game gave him 1,000 for his career. ... Veteran Wesley Johnson saw his first action of the season in the second quarter, when Darius Miller went to the locker room with a bruised quadriceps. QUOTABLE Holiday was nearby when Hill was shoved away from the Nets' bench area and complimented Brooklyn's use of technology to diagram plays. ""I saw they had an iPad and I'm like, `Dang, that's pretty cool,"" Holiday said, noting Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry ""is still using the board to write on."" FROM DOWNTOWN Seven Nets players hit 3s and five made more than one. Dudley, Napier and Spencer Dinwiddie each hit three. But LeVert struggled from long range, missing five of six. Brooklyn is 61 of 141 (43.3 percent) from 3-point range in its past four games. EARLY SURGE The Nets made 10 of 19 3-point attempts in the first half, when Russell made his first four. Brooklyn led by as many as 13, at 66-53, on LeVert's driving layup as he was fouled late in the second quarter.","401070753"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> De'Aaron Fox had to plea repeatedly with Kings teammate Nemanja Bjelica to shoot the ball after Bjelica missed his only two attempts in the first quarter. Once Bjelica got the message, Sacramento's offense started to click. Bjelica made three of his career high-tying six 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and had a key block on John Wall late, and the Kings beat the Washington Wizards 116-112 on Friday night. ""He just opens up everything,"" Fox said. ""European guys, they always want to make the right play so sometimes he doesn't shoot it. I told him, 'Shoot the ball. That's why we brought (you) here.' That's what he started doing."" Bjelica finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds. Buddy Hield scored 22 points and made three free throws over the final 20 seconds for the Kings. ""We got after them and we got our hands on a lot of basketballs,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We need that. That helps us play faster."" Bjelica was scoreless in the first quarter but got going in the second when he scored seven consecutive points. After making back-to-back 3s as part of an 11-0 run in the third, Bjelica made three more shots beyond the arc in the fourth, added a key assist to Hield with 2:45 remaining and then blocked Wall's shot moments later. ""Everything is about opportunity in this league,"" Bjelica said. ""I know that I can play like this but sometimes it's hard because we are such a talented team and there are great players in this league. I'm not just a shooter."" Willie Cauley-Stein also had a double-double with 17 points and 11 boards for the Kings. Fox added 17 points and nine assists. The Wizards, who led by six going into the fourth quarter, committed three turnovers in the final 24 seconds. Sacramento led 110-104 with two minutes left before Washington made a late run and pulled to 113-112 on Wall's 3-pointer with 3.2 seconds remaining. After Fox made one of two free throws, Jeff Green attempted a long inbounds pass but the ball sailed out of bounds. Bjelica then made two free throws to seal the win and end the Kings' four-game losing streak to the Wizards. ""A lot of mistakes on the defensive end, mainly in transition,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""Sometimes we let our offense dictate how we play on the defensive end. If you're not making shots you still have to defend."" Things got chippy at times between the teams during an often sloppy game. Washington had a season-high 21 turnovers while Sacramento committed 19. Wall scored 26 points with eight assists. Kelly Oubre had 22 points and nine rebounds, and Bradley Beal scored 21. Beal skipped the pregame shootaround after sustaining a chest injury in Washington's 144-122 loss at Golden State on Wednesday and struggled with his shot early. The Wizards' leading scorer, Beal missed 10 of his first 12 shots, including a long jumper at the halftime buzzer. Beal also appeared to get cut behind his ear midway through the second quarter when he crashed to the floor under the hoop and hit the back of his head on a camera. ""We're not guarding (anybody) and that's what it comes down to,"" Beal said. ""We've given up like 100 points in every game so far this year and that's terrible.""

"DETROIT --  With Jaylen Brown struggling offensive so far this season, Brad Stevens still asked him if he wanted a shot at defending one of the NBA's hottest players. Not only did Brown slow down the much bigger Blake Griffin, his offense also perked up in the process. Brown scored 19 points and Marcus Morris added 18 for the Boston Celtics in a 109-89 victory on Saturday night over the Detroit Pistons, who lost their first game of the season. Brown came in averaging 8.6 points per game this season, down from 14.5 last year. ""I wasn't tripping,"" Brown said. ""And I've guarded bigs before, especially my rookie year. Actually when Blake was (with the Los Angeles Clippers), I guarded him a little bit. So I was familiar when Brad asked me."" Andre Drummond had 18 points and eight rebounds, and Stanley Johnson scored a season-high 16 for Detroit, which had won its first four games of the season for the first time since 2008-09.? Griffin came in averaging 33.8 points per game, shooting 55.7 percent from the field and 65.2 percent from 3. He missed his first seven shots, including four from 3-point range. ""I just missed open shots early,"" Griffin said. ""I thought that I tried to attack at times and get to the foul line but it didn't go that way."" He scored seven points in 30 minutes, finished 2 of 13 from the field and 0-4 from deep. ""Blake's a handful,"" Stevens said. ""We knew we were mostly going to have to play small on (Griffin) or Drummond, so we just tried to be very active around those guys."" Detroit came in shooting 37.6 percent from 3-point range this season, and went 7 for 37 (18.9 percent). Boston shot 14 for 34 (41.2 percent) from deep. ""It is disappointing,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""One game doesn't make a season. It should get our attention and show us how well we have to play each and every night."" The Celtics opened up a 103-74 lead with 5:15 left to play, cruising in the first of consecutive games. Casey was assessed his first technical foul with Detroit, protesting a first-quarter no-call after Griffin hit the ground. The subsequent Morris free throw capped an 8-0 run that made it 23-11 Boston in the first quarter. The Boston bench outscored Detroit's 34-9 in the first half, as the Celtics opened up a pair of 26-point leads in the second quarter. The Pistons previous largest deficit of the season was 12 points in the opener against Brooklyn. Daniel Theis, who Stevens said was questionable to play with a foot injury, scored 14 points and had seven rebounds before halftime. He finished with 17 points and eight rebounds. Gordon Hayward scored season-high 15 points and Terry Rozier added 14 points off the bench for Boston. TIP-INS Celtics: Aron Baynes, who played two seasons in Detroit, missed his third straight game with a right hamstring strain. .

"NEW ORLEANS --  When Ricky Rubio learned he wouldn't have to worry about Anthony Davis guarding the paint for the Pelicans, the Jazz point guard figured he better look for Utah big-man Rudy Gobert at the rim whenever possible. ""I was looking more to that than anything else,"" Rubio said, adding that when New Orleans' defense collapsed on Gobert, he was able to take advantage of that as well. Rubio had 28 points and 12 assists, Gobert had 25 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks, and Utah became the first team this season to beat New Orleans, 132-111 on Saturday night. ""When Ricky plays like that, it's hard to lose,"" said Gobert, who had a handful of dunks set up by Rubio, several on alley-oop lobs. ""We've got a lot of guys that can score and when Ricky starts to make the right play and puts even more pressure on the defense, it's hard to guard for sure."" Davis was ruled out shortly before the game because of his sprained right elbow -- an injury through which he'd played in a victory a night earlier over Brooklyn. ""There's not any long-term concern,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""He came in today and tried to shoot at shoot-around, and there was a still a little bit of pain. ... I'm not going to risk anything over one game. The Davis-Gobert matchup has been a competitive and compelling one in recent seasons. With Davis out, Gobert had his best offensive game of the young season. He'd come in averaging 14.5 points and had not scored more than 19 points in a game this season. Jazz coach Quin Snyder was quick to highlight the effect of Davis sitting out, noting the Pelicans' five-time All-Star is ""obviously one of the best players in the league, maybe playing the best of anyone in the league right now."" ""We did a good job of trying to attack them in a way that was effective, given his absence,"" Snyder added. Rubio was averaging just 6 points coming in and hadn't scored more than 13 in a game. ""I've got to be more regular. Sometimes I'm not as aggressive as I was tonight,"" Rubio said. ""I felt my shot and kept shooting and we had a good night."" It was perhaps fitting that a Frenchman and Spaniard would dominate in New Orleans -- a city founded by the French and ruled by the Spanish during the early part of its 300-year history, and where Jazz music, as well as the NBA franchise named for it, were born. Rubio has been brilliant in the Big Easy before. He scored 30 in a triumphant trip to New Orleans last March. ""I love playing here,"" Rubio said. Donovan Mitchell scored 22 for Utah. Nikola Mirotic scored 25 points, but 15 of that came in the first quarter, when he hit three 3s and helped the Pelicans take a 31-28 lead into the second period. Jrue Holiday scored 18 points. ""Ricky and Gobert really got the whole lob situation going,"" Holiday said. ""Next time, I think we've got to do a better job at containing them.""

LaVine had 27 points and a career-high 11 rebounds, and the Bulls went 7 of 10 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter to pull away for a 97-85 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. One night earlier, the Bulls were embarrassed 135-106 at Charlotte. ""It's good to get a win,"" said LaVine, who has led the Bulls in scoring in all six games. ""I was upset with the effort that we gave (Friday)."" Jabari Parker scored half of his 18 points in the fourth quarter for the Bulls, who struggled from long range for the first three quarters, making 5 of 23 from beyond the arc. Rookie Wendell Carter Jr. had 10 points and 10 rebounds while playing his first NBA game in his hometown. Trae Young, who entered leading rookies with 21.5 points per game, scored 13 points on 3-of-12 shooting for the Hawks and turned the ball over five times. Taurean Prince led Atlanta with 16 points and reserve Dewayne Dedmon had 13 points and 13 rebounds. Prince, Young and Kent Bazemore combined for 15 of Atlanta's 22 turnovers on a night when the Hawks shot 32.1 percent (27 of 84). ""Coming off two games where we played well (and won), it was a lesson in how you handle success,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Sometimes, we were trying to do too much, and it was evident with our 22 turnovers. ... I thought right from the start we were trying to hit home runs."" Both teams were cold in the first half. The Hawks led 44-41 at the break while shooting 26.2 percent from the field (11 of 42), including a 3-for-15 performance in the paint. Atlanta did make 8 of 22 3-point attempts in the first half to hold the Bulls at bay as Chicago made 15 of 45 overall and 4 of 17 from beyond the arc. The Bulls led 67-63 after three quarters. Atlanta got within two on Vince Carter's 3-pointer midway through the fourth, but the Bulls responded with a 9-2 run, including two 3-pointers by Justin Holiday. ""They didn't like how last night went,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I saw it in their eyes."" The Bulls out-rebounded the Hawks 14-6 in the fourth quarter on the way to their fourth straight win over Atlanta. ""They were fighting,"" Pierce said. ""They lost pretty bad (Friday) night, so they came out with a greater sense of urgency than we did."" TIP-INS Ryan Arcidiacono had 13 points for Chicago and Holiday had 12. ... Forward Bobby Portis, Chicago's leading rebounder, missed his second straight game with a sprained right knee. ... The Hawks asked for a moment of silence before the game for the victims of Saturday's shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a gunman killed 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in U.S. history. HOMECOMING OF SORTS Pierce won't be sentimental about returning to Philadelphia, where he was an assistant before taking the Atlanta job, to face the 76ers on Monday night. ""You look forward to going back to a place you spent a lot of time with the staff, the players, but it's about us. This really is a business trip. It's about us trying to correct what we did tonight,"" he said. ""It will be a tough atmosphere, having been there."" NOT RUNNING WITH THE BULLS The Hawks want to outrun opponents and score easy points, but they were beaten 16-11 in fast-break points, scoring on just 3 of 9 tries.","401070757"
"CLEVELAND --  Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers didn't have to worry about LeBron James on this trip to Cleveland. Oladipo scored 24 points, Bojan Bogdanovic led the way with 25 points and Indiana kept the Cavaliers winless on the season with a 119-107 victory on Saturday night. The teams met for the first time since Cleveland defeated Indiana in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last season. James scored 45 points in Game 7 and the Cavaliers survived their toughest test in reaching the NBA Finals for the fourth straight season. Oladipo hasn't forgotten anything about that game. ""Every time I play here, I sit here in this same locker,"" he said. ""Every time I land in Cleveland, I think about it. I watched it all summer, probably about 75 times. It's all I thought about."" The Pacers had no such troubles this time. Indiana took control midway through the fourth quarter and followed up its 20-point win in San Antonio on Wednesday with another road victory. Cleveland (0-6) is off to its worst start since losing its first seven games in the 1995-96 season. The Cavaliers are struggling to adjust without James, who signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency. Cleveland also missed forward Kevin Love, who was out for the second straight game because of a sore left foot. Cleveland committed 18 turnovers that led to 30 points and helped Indiana shoot 65 percent (48 for 74) from the field. ""Our margin for error is slim,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""It's very slim."" Cleveland cut a 15-point lead to 97-91 early in the fourth quarter before Indiana regained control with four straight baskets. Darren Collison scored on a layup and a jumper, Oladipo hit a 12-footer and Domanta Sabonis scored in the lane. Sabonis made another layup and Oladipo's 3-pointer with 3:58 left pushed the lead to 113-98. Indiana (4-2) placed six players in double figures. Collison, Myles Turner and Sabonis each scored 15 points while Thaddeus Young added 10. ""We didn't want to make it a trap game,"" Collison said. ""Every team in the NBA is respectable, regardless of who is out there. They played as hard as we did tonight."" Rodney Hood led Cleveland with 17 points while Larry Nance Jr. came off the bench to score 15. Cleveland has struggled without James, who signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency while Love leads the team with 19 points a game. Indiana went ahead for good midway through the second quarter. Oladipo scored on a layup, a dunk and a jumper as Indiana turned a four-point deficit into a 60-55 halftime lead. The Pacers' run continued in the third quarter. Oladipo and Bogdanovic hit 3-pointers, and Collison knocked down a jumper from the corner and scored in the lane, to lead 81-66. Indiana guard Tyreke Evans sat out the game because of a violation of team rules. In a tweet posted by the team Friday, Evans said he was late for practice. He's expected to play Monday against Portland. LOVE UPDATE The five-time All-Star, who leads the team scoring 19 points a game, also missed Thursday's game against Detroit. Love missed three of the Cavaliers' four exhibition games because of the injury, and it's uncertain when he'll return. ""He tried to play through it understanding we hadn't won a game and we were struggling a little bit,"" Lue said. ""He wanted to be on the floor and try to make a difference. We applaud him for that. We just hope he can get healthy soon."" TEAM WIN Coach Nate McMillan was pleased with the way the Pacers played in the final two quarters. ""In the second half, we got stops when we needed to and really just wore them down,"" he said. ""We did a good job recognizing where we had matchups."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana's depth has been a major factor in the early going. Six players average in double figures and two others scored nine points a game. ... Evans is averaging 12 points in five games in his first season with the team. Cavaliers: Rookie Collin Sexton was assessed a technical foul after swatting away Cory Joseph's hand as the Pacers guard was battling for position on an inbounds play. Sexton, taken with the eighth pick in the first round of the draft, had 12 points but was 2 of 8 from the field. ""There's going to be ups and downs,"" Lue said. ""I just don't want him to get down on himself. He's going to make mistakes and that's just part of the game."" ...  F Sam Dekker started in place of Love, scoring six points with five rebounds in 24 minutes.","401070758"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The ""3-and-D"" approach fit Philadelphia's Robert Covington perfectly. Covington hit a key 3-pointer down the stretch and made Charlotte star Kemba Walker work hard for every point, helping the 76ers defeat the Hornets 105-103 on Saturday night. Joel Embiid had 27 points and 14 rebounds and J.J. Redick and also hit a key 3-pointer late. The game was tied at 99 after Walker's 3-pointer with 3:04 left. Redick put the 76ers ahead 102-99 with 2:03 left by nailing a 3 from the left wing. Walker answered with a layup to pull Charlotte within one, but Covington drained a 3-pointer from the right wing five seconds later to make it 105-101. Covington finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds. He also chased the speedy and talented Walker all over the court. Walker scored 37 points but needed 31 shots, finishing 11-for-31 from the field. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown credited Covington. ""Covington's best game of the year,"" Brown said. ""He ended up being our bell-ringer. He had that big 3 to really seal the game. He was very good tonight."" Embiid also was his usual good self despite being game-time decision after injuring his left ankle in practice on Friday. But the Philadelphia big man didn't favor his ankle at all while recording his sixth double-double in as many games to start the season. ""I'm good,"" he said. Ben Simmons contributed 14 points and 12 rebounds for Philadelphia, which evened its record at 3-3. The Philadelphia point guard credited Covington. ""Covington's amazing game on Kemba made it tough for him to score,"" he said. Walker entered second behind Steph Curry in 3-point attempts (64) and 3-pointers made (29) but went just 3-for-15 from the arc on Saturday. The two-time All-Star had 30 points, hitting 11 of 18 from the field, in Friday's 135-106 win over Chicago. Hornets coach James Borrego acknowledged that the back-to-back situation likely affected Walker. ""Sometimes those shots don't fall with tired legs,"" he said. Overall, though, Borrego liked his team's performance. ""Great effort, especially defensively,"" he said. ""I'm really proud how they battled."" Following Covington's 3-pointer, the Hornets missed all four of their field-goal attempts from that point, with Walker's two free throws with 2.6 seconds left accounting for their final points. Neither team led by more than six points in a tightly contested second half. The 76ers erased an 85-83 deficit to start the fourth by scoring six straight to open the period and take an 89-85 lead with 10:50 left. Second-year guard Markelle Fultz electrified the crowd with a one-handed fastbreak dunk during the spurt. Fultz also drew cheers with a first-half spinning layup and a third-quarter baseline jumper. The second-year guard re-worked his jump shot over the summer after shooting struggles during an injury-plagued season last year. TIP-INS Hornets: G Tony Parker (rest) didn't play.  . Rookie Miles Bridges had 14 points. 76ers: Wilson Chandler (hamstring) missed his sixth straight game to start the season. . Embiid has a double-double in every game this season. .

"MIAMI --  These are the games where Goran Dragic likes to prove his worth, the ones against a fellow All-Star point guard. And make no mistake, Portland's Damian Lillard was great. But when it mattered most, Dragic came through for Miami. Dragic scored 28 points, outscoring Portland 8-7 by himself in the final 3:52, and Heat scrambled in the final minutes to beat the Trail Blazers 120-111 on Saturday night. Miami led by as many as 19, then found itself trailing twice in the fourth quarter and pulled out a late rally on a night when Lillard went for 42 points. ""We knew they were going to make their run,"" said Dragic, who went over the career 10,000-point mark in the first half. ""We knew we just had to stick to our game plan and we did."" Lillard played through what he said was ""a little hyperextension"" of his right elbow, something that happened when he got caught on a screen, but he still made 15 of 28 shots. ""I knew that it would eventually be a game,"" Lillard said. ""That's what we do. We kept grinding."" The Heat made their final five shots, the last four of them from 3-point range -- two by Dragic including the one that put Miami up for good, one by Josh Richardson and another by Rodney McGruder. Kelly Olynyk and Dwyane Wade each had 19 for Miami, which got 14 from McGruder, 11 from Richardson and a 16-rebound, six-block effort from Hassan Whiteside. CJ McCollum scored 19 for Portland, and Zach Collins finished with 13. ""I thought they made some timely shots,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Lillard's 3-pointer with 5:38 left gave Portland its first lead since the opening minutes at 99-96, and a pair of free throws by Collins kept the Trail Blazers' lead at three with just under four minutes left. From there, it was all Miami -- sparked by a brilliant play from Dragic. In transition, he slowed at the top of the 3-point arc knowing that he was about to get slammed into by Collins. The foul got called, Dragic made two of the three free throws, and his 3-pointer with 2:34 left put Miami ahead for good. ""It turned the momentum or at least showed it down,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""A very heady play."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard eclipsed the 11,000-point mark; he came into the night 31 shy of that, and had 32 through three quarters. ... Portland was outscored by 11 points in the opening quarter. The Blazers hadn't lost any quarter by more than four points in their first four games. ... Moe Harkless played 10 first-half minutes, and then didn't return because of left knee soreness. ... The 111 points were a season low for Portland. Heat: Dragic became the first Slovenian player to reach the 10,000-point mark in the NBA. He entered with 9,994. ... Wade made four 3-pointers in the first half -- the first time he had four 3s in a half since Nov. 19, 2016, for Chicago against the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Justise Winslow (hamstring tightness) made his season debut and finished with 10 points. Wayne Ellington (ankle) was cleared to make his, but did not play. VETERAN SPARK Wade sparked an immediate 9-0 run the first time he checked into the game, and before long the Heat had total control of the early going. His fadeaway 3-pointer less than 2 minutes into the second gave Miami a 41-22 lead, the end of what was a 28-7 Heat spurt that took about 7 1/2 minutes. Wade's falling-down, from-behind-the-backboard 3 with less than a second left sent Miami into the break with a 57-42 cushion. ""I didn't even see it go in,"" Wade said. EVEN STOTTS The loss lowered Stotts' career record to 390-390. While his Portland teams have consistently been very good, his career record has somehow never been better than two games over .500.","401070760"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Despite a bit of a youth movement, it's still the Marc Gasol and Mike Conley show for the Memphis Grizzlies -- with a good amount of defense mixed in. Memphis, held Phoenix to 46 percent shooting, including the Suns connecting on only 9 of 33 shots outside the arc in a 117-96 victory Saturday night. ""I think defense is what really keys and starts our offense for us,"" said Conley, who finished with 18 points and seven assists. ""Gives us easy opportunities. Gives us a different flow, a different rhythm. .It allows us to play with a little more pace and get guys more opportunities."" Gasol led the Memphis scoring with 19 points. MarShon Brooks, like Conley, had 18 points, Garrett Temple added 15, and Wayne Selden 14. ""We want to be a versatile offensive team where you can't key in on one or two guys to shut us down,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""It's good to see a bunch of guys get double-figure points. That means we're sharing the ball well."" With Suns leading scorer Devin Booker out nursing a left hamstring strain, it was up to Deandre Ayton, the first overall pick in last summer's draft, to do his part. He led Phoenix, scoring 24 points -- tops for his young season -- and had eight rebounds. But he didn't get a lot of offensive help to replace Booker's missing 28 points a game. Guard Isaiah Canaan was the only other starter reaching double figures, scoring 11 points. Rookie Elie Okobo came off the bench for 12 points, and Jamal Crawford added 11. The Suns have lost four straight. While Memphis took a first-quarter lead, the advantage was built in the second, when the Grizzlies outscored Phoenix 42-25 for a 68-43 halftime lead. ""We came out lackadaisical with the turnovers and stuff,"" Ayton said. ""They started getting (into) a rhythm early, and they started making a lot of shots in the first half, especially in the second quarter."" From there, Memphis would extend it to 26 midway through the fourth quarter, leading both coaches to start clearing their benches. ""We are repeating the same mistakes. Turnovers, obviously.""

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks proved they could thrive, at least temporarily, without their franchise player. With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined to start the second half while being evaluated for a possible concussion, the Bucks built a big third-quarter lead and cruised to a 113-91 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. The Bucks have won six consecutive games to start the season, one shy of the record set by the 1971-72 team. The win sets up a Monday night showdown in Milwaukee with the Toronto Raptors, the league's only other unbeaten team. Antetokounmpo, who finished with 21 points in a season-low 19 minutes, fell to the floor underneath the basket midway through the first quarter after catching an elbow from the Magic's Aaron Gordon. ""I just got hit in the head,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I tried to block the shot. I fell down. I don't remember much after that. I have to be careful with that. We did some (concussion) tests in the second quarter and some additional tests in the third quarter."" When asked what he remembered about the play, Antetokoumpo said he was ""probably knocked out."" ""I just remember the hit. But I'm fine,"" he said. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer noted that Antetokounmpo continued to play close to his normal minutes in the first half after the blow to the head before being sent back to the locker room to undergo further tests after halftime. Antetokounmpo played 3 minutes in the fourth quarter. ""We just wanted to be extra cautious, make sure everything was OK and give him an extra look,"" Budenholzer said. Gordon described Antetokounmpo as ""tough"" for coming back out on the court. ""He is resilient. I hit him with the elbow, unintentionally,"" Gordon said. ""It was hard. Props to him for coming back into the game."" Khris Middleton added 18 points and Malcolm Brogdon scored 16 for the Bucks, who were coming off a 125-95 blowout of the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road on Friday night in which they made 19 3-pointers on 46 attempts, both season highs. Milwaukee connected on just 10 of 30 shots from long range against the Magic. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and nine rebounds for Orlando. D.J. Augustin added 11, all in the first half. The Magic shot 32 percent from the field overall and 23 percent from 3-point range. ""We didn't do a good job playing our game tonight,"" Vucevic said. The Magic attempted a franchise-record 43 3-pointers and made 10. ""It is part of our game plan to have a lot of us shooting 3s and space the floor,"" Vucevic said. ""Our 3s tonight weren't exactly good ones. You can't just shoot any shot. You've got to make sure you work for the right one."" After a tightly contested first quarter in which Orlando led by five at one point, the Bucks took control in the second and built a 14-point lead at the half. Antetokounmpo had 15 first-half points, while Middleton had 12. Milwaukee's lead grew to 26 in the third with Antetokoumpo on the bench for the entire period. The Bucks closed the quarter on an 11-1 run and headed to the fourth with a 93-68 lead. LESS WEAR AND TEAR Although it took a shot to the head to keep him off the court on Saturday night, Antetokounmpo only logged 23 minutes of playing time on Friday night in the blowout win. He said he appreciates the rest during back-to-back games.

"LeBron James details the thought process in the last few seconds when the Lakers had a chance to tie the Spurs. (0:52) SAN ANTONIO -- The Spurs are still working to develop a comfort and chemistry with one another, but have already discovered they can count on DeMar DeRozan to come through late. DeRozan had 30 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and the Spurs rallied in the fourth quarter, overcoming 35 points and 11 rebounds from LeBron James to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 110-106 on Saturday night. DeRozan had 14 points in the second half, including eight in the fourth quarter, for his second double-double in five games after failing to get any last season with Toronto. ""Whenever we're down, it's kind of natural to me to just try to be more aggressive,"" DeRozan said. ""Go out there, whether it's to score or try to find guys and just try to get us going."" San Antonio fed off the energy, rebounding from a 20-point loss against Indiana as Gregg Popovich became the fifth coach to win 1,200 games and the first to do so with one team. The Spurs' first lead came at 93-91 with 10 minutes remaining when DeRozan laid in his own miss after beating three Lakers to the rebound. ""I just wanted to kind of get that bucket, kind of get the crowd into it, get your teammates into it, the bench gets into and we all kind of feed off the energy after that,"" he said. San Antonio would build the lead to eight points before James cut it to 106-105 with four straight points an assist to Josh Hart on a 3-pointer. DeRozan responded with a fadeaway jumper on Hart with 15.9 seconds remaining to help preserve the lead and the eventual win. ""When you have those games where your offense isn't clicking like it is, you've got to be able to rely on your defense, and we did that tonight,"" James said. ""We were down one, they had the ball, and DeRozan hit a tough, tough two over Josh. We did our job, and that's all you can ask for."" The Spurs also tried to lock in defensively after struggling offensively for much of the game. San Antonio entered the game allowing 121.8 points, but held Los Angeles to 46 points in the second and 18 in the final quarter. ""That sort of thing is what we're used to and that's really the first time this year that we've done that,"" Popovich said. ""If that can become a habit you have a good opportunity to win a lot of games We're not there yet we're not going to be consistent at that right nowbut we did do it tonight and that was great."" The Lakers shot 53 percent in the first half and led by as many as 14 points. Kyle Kuzma, who made his first two 3-pointers, finished with 15 points for Los Angeles. Lance Stephenson added 14 points, including a 3-pointer at the close of the first quarter that he punctuated by posing for the fans sitting courtside. DeRozan scored eight points in the final four minutes of the first half, including an emphatic dunk between two defenders, to cut a 13-point lead into a more manageable 60-54 deficit entering the third quarter. The Spurs tied it at 71 with 6:52 remaining in the third, but the Lakers went on a 17-6 run to reclaim a double-digit lead.

"NEW YORK --  Golden State appeared on its way to another easy victory when the game suddenly turned into a 3-point shootout. Luckily for the Warriors, they have the perfect guy for that. Stephen Curry set another NBA record by making seven 3-pointers and finished with 35 points as the Warriors held on to beat the Brooklyn Nets 120-114 on Sunday. Kevin Durant added 34 for the Warriors, who were coasting before the Nets made it close with some sizzling shooting behind the arc. Curry finally turned them back when his final 3-pointer made it 115-108 with 1:07 to play. He has made at least five 3s in all seven games, breaking George McCloud's record of six games in a row during the 1995-96 season. ""They got hot in the fourth to try to make it interesting, but made enough plays down the stretch to obviously get the win,"" Curry said. Klay Thompson continued to struggle behind the arc, going 1 for 5 and falling to 5 for 36 this season. He finished with 18 points and still hasn't had a 20-point outing this season. D'Angelo Russell scored 25 points and Caris LeVert had 23 for the Nets, who made 20 3-pointers in 42 attempts and cut a 19-point deficit down to two. ""I think the 3-pointer got them back in the game and ended up we had to play a little bit and execute down the stretch, so it was a solid outing for us,"" Durant said. Golden State has won four in a row since its lone loss and the previous three were all by at least 20 points. The franchise record is four straight 20-point victories, set by the San Francisco Warriors in 1966-67, and it appeared the Warriors were going to equal that. Curry scored 16 points in the first quarter. The Nets hung close until midway through the second, and another 3 by Curry pushed it to 63-44 with 1:55 remaining in the half. ""The way the first half went we easily could have kind of folded and that's not what kind of guys we have in that locker room,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They're a resilient bunch and I thought they competed their tails off and it was good for the fans to see that we didn't just succumb to their talent or their aura so to speak."" Draymond Green had a season-high 13 assists. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston missed the game with a sore right foot. ... Thompson met before the game with 14 young players from the Caribbean who are part of the NBA's Jumpstart program.

Kerr said they had a good talk since and the volatile center understands things are different with the Warriors than his previous teams. ""That kind of stuff is not going to help us win a championship, it's not going to help his reputation and I think he understands that,"" Kerr said. SOMBER SPEAKING A somber Kerr said the sad thing about the shooting that killed 11 in a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday is that he's not surprised when it happens because there is so much gun violence and division in the U.S. ""We're broken right now and so nothing surprises us anymore, or nothing surprises me anymore,"" Kerr said. ""Shootings at schools and churches, synagogues, malls, movie theaters, and we need our leaders to step up and unite the country with the appropriate words and the appropriate actions and we're not getting that right now. It's frustrating and I don't know what else to say."" Kerr said he planned to vote for all candidates who back gun control and safety. His father, Malcolm Kerr, a professor who served as president of the American University of Beirut, was shot and killed outside his office in the war-torn Lebanese capital in 1984.","401070764"
"DALLAS --  It's something special when Utah's Rudy Gobert and Dallas' DeAndre Jordan face each other. Centers Gobert and Jordan recorded their sixth straight double-doubles in six games this season, but it was the Jazz who emerged with the win, defeating the Mavericks 113-104 in a sloppy game Sunday night. Gobert finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds, and Jordan added 12 points, 4 for 4 from the line, 19 rebounds and a career-high nine assists. ""Any time you play against another top center in the league, I'm sure it's going to be a challenge,"" Jordan said. ""But it's fun, I'm a competitor and I'm sure he is too."" Any rivalry between them is not bitter. ""It's friendly,"" Jordan said. ""We're always going to talk smack, but you know it's just part of the game."" Gobert has had his way with the Mavericks in the past but noticed a difference since Jordan arrived in Dallas this season from the Clippers. ""It makes a big difference when you have a guy that can rebound, that can protect the basket,"" Gobert said. ""He brings a lot of attention when he runs to the basket, so I think it changes the team for sure."" The Jazz overcame 18 turnovers and won going away after taking a five-point lead, 82-77, into the fourth quarter. Donovan Mitchell scored 20 points for Utah. Jae Crowder added 15 points and Joe Ingles had 12. Jazz coach Quin Snyder said his team doesn't rely on any one player. ""We're not about our starters, we are not about our bench and we are not about any one player,"" he said. Examples were second-year man Georges Niang and rookie Grayson Allen, who exceeded or equaled their NBA high point totals. Dennis Smith Jr. kept Dallas in the game with strong second-half shooting, going 9 for 12 from the field, including 7 for 7 with two 3-pointers for 16 points in the third quarter. He had 21 of his game-high and career-high-tying 27 points in the second half. Wesley Matthews scored 22, Luka Doncic added 14 and Maxi Kleber had 11 for Dallas. Jordan explained how he could have three more assists than his previous high total. ""I'm up there at the top of the key a lot trying to make plays. Wes and Dennis and Harrison (Barnes) do a great job of cutting and it was easier to find those guys today."" The first quarter ended with Utah leading 26-19. Dallas shot 26 percent (6 for 23) from the field in the period. In contrast, the Jazz were 11 for 16 (69 percent) from the field in the second quarter. Nine Utah turnovers in the quarter helped Dallas stay within 50-46 at halftime. Despite Smith's 16 points in the third quarter, the Jazz outscored Dallas 32-31. TIP-INS Jazz: F Derrick Favors did not play because of a sore left knee. ... Jae Crowder left the game after rolling an ankle. X rays were negative. ... Second-year F Georges Niang had a career-high 13 points. Rookie Grayson Allen tied his NBA high with 11. Mavericks: PG Dennis Smith Jr. returned after missing a game with a sprained right ankle. ... G Devin Harris missed his fifth straight game because of a strained left hamstring. Coach Rick Carlisle said Harris could return to play on Wednesday against the Lakers. TALKING A GOOD GAME Jordan, a career 45-percent free throw shooter, made all four attempts against. Utah, and is 26 for 30 (87 percent) this season. When he goes to the line now, he talks to the player lined up to his left, and then to his right, before shooting as a technique to relax and improve his concentration. BALANCE Eight players tied for the scoring lead in the first quarter. Five Utah players and three Mavericks each scored four. At halftime, Jazz G Donovan Mitchell was the only player in double figures.","401070765"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder didn't care that Phoenix had just one win this season, was playing the second game of a back-to-back and was missing its leading scorer. They just wanted to get a win. Oklahoma City finally broke through for the first time in five tries this season. Paul George and Russell Westbrook each scored 23 points, and the Thunder beat the Suns 117-110 on Sunday. ""It feels special,"" guard Dennis Schroder said. ""I think we can build off of that win. We're going to keep getting better. It was a good one tonight."" Nerlens Noel had 20 points and 15 rebounds and Patrick Patterson added 17 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City's victory left the Cleveland Cavaliers, who fired coach Tyronn Lue on Sunday, as the league's only winless team. Thunder center Steven Adams did not play after experiencing tightness in his left calf during pregame warmups, and Noel started in his place. Coach Billy Donovan was pleased with the way Noel performed in his first start. ""He did a lot of really good things,"" Donovan said. ""He was really, really active. He was very active defensively. He scored some points on some lobs and some rolls and he got to the free-throw line. I was really, really impressed with his defense."" Noel has started 159 of his 228 career games, so he was comfortable in the role. ""Just do this on a nightly basis, just being a professional, ready for whatever is thrown at me in this position,"" he said. ""Steven wasn't able to go, so I just kept the same mindset of being able to be ready, no matter what. I knew if I was coming off the bench, if I was starting, I'd play the same way. That's about it."" Rookie Elie Okobo scored 18 points and No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton added 16 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Devin Booker, who entered the day as the league's ninth-best scorer at 27.8 points per game, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. The Thunder led 62-48 at halftime after shooting 49 percent from the field. George scored 15 points before the break, while Westbrook made just two field goals. The Thunder blew a 16-point halftime lead against Boston on Thursday, so the threat of falling apart still was there. Westbrook hit back-to-back layups to make it 82-65 in the third. George drained a shot from just beyond half court at the third-quarter buzzer to put Oklahoma City up 96-76. ""It's one of the funnest basketball games I've played in since I've been here,"" Noel said. ""Guys just play so unselfish. This team is really built the right way. Guys just want to make winning plays, and everybody is going to excel when the play style is like that."" Phoenix outscored the Thunder 34-21 in the fourth quarter. ""A lot of positives in the game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""You're not going to feel better -- we lost the game. But effort was there. I think we tried, and we tried for 48 minutes.""

"LOS ANGELES --  In a season where putting up lots of points has been a nightly occurrence, the Los Angeles Clippers have also been trying to win with their defense. Tobias Harris scored 22 points to lead nine players in double-figures as the Los Angeles Clippers coasted to a 136-104 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. ""It was because of our defense,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Everybody's excited about the offense, but its the defense that does the dirty work and allows everybody to score."" Lou Williams added 17 points on his 32nd birthday for the Clippers, who shot 54 percent from the field, made 16-of-29 3-pointers, and outrebounded Washington 57-45. ""As a team, we want to not only be known as an offensive team in the West, but a defensive team as well,"" said Avery Bradley who had 15 points. ""We know defense wins games, and that's our mentality going into games."" Two nights after posting a 133-113 road victory over the Houston Rockets, the Clippers held the Wizards to a season-low in points and won for the fourth time in their last five games. ""We know what we have in the locker room,"" said Clippers guard Patrick Beverley. ""Whatever the standings might be, whatever is said on paper, you've got to play the game. And we like to play the game."" Bradley Beal scored 20 points and John Wall added 18 for Washington, which shot 40 percent and missed 22 of 27 3s. The Wizards are 1-5 this season and have lost 11 in a row to the Clippers in Los Angeles, dating back to Feb. 13, 2008. ""Our defense was horrendous. I don't know how we expect to win,"" said Wizards reserve guard Austin Rivers. ""Teams are just walking into the paint, making layups, getting open threes. It just comes from effort and talking. You've just got to have personal pride. You've got to get mad when somebody scores on you."" After Washington pulled within 81-71, the Clippers ran off 16 unanswered points, including three 3-pointers by Patrick Beverley, for a 97-71 lead with 2:15 left in the third. The Wizards missed three shots and turned the ball over twice in the run. Leading 21-18, the Clippers capped a 14-2 spurt with a 3-pointer by Williams for a 35-20 advantage with 10:58 left in the second quarter. After two free throws by Jeff Green, back-to-back lay-ins by Harris gave Los Angeles its biggest lead to that point at 42-24 with 9:24 left in the half. The Wizards got within 52-45 only to see the Clippers expand their lead to 69-54 by halftime. Back-to-back dunks by Harris early in the third quarter put Los Angeles up 77-60 with 8:26 left in the third. We have to be one of the best teams chemistry-wise,"" Harris said of the Clippers. ""It's just a matter of us continuing to build on that, and I think we've still got a ways to go in that department."" TIP-INS Wizards: Markieff Morris (flu-like symptoms) was a game-time decision. The Wizards were playing their fourth of five road games, their longest trip of the season, and fourth straight in the Pacific Time Zone. ... Dwight Howard (gluteal soreness) missed his fifth straight game working out back in Washington. Clippers: Avery Bradley's 3-pointer with 4:58 left in the first quarter, his third of the game, was the 600th of his NBA career.

Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) sat out his second straight game. FAMILY REUNION The game was the first in which Doc Rivers coached against his son, Austin Rivers, since Austin was traded by the Clippers to the Wizards in June after four years with the lippers. ""In New Orleans (in 2014), at least the first time, it was really cool. I didn't even know what to do. Shake his hand? Wish him luck?"" said Doc Rivers. ""Now, you just want to beat him. And he wants to beat me. That's the way it is."" MULTIPLE MILESTONES With his fourth rebound with 3:59 left in the half, Marcin Gortat moved past Al Horford into 15th place on the NBA's all-time Total Rebound list, and finished with seven for the game, putting him at 6,153 rebounds for his career. John Wall played his 547th game for the Wizards, moving him into 9th place on the team's all-time list, one behind Jeff Malone. RIVERS HOT OVER LUE Doc Rivers did not mince words when asked about the Cavaliers decision to fire Tyronn Lue on Sunday. ""We talked for a long time because he's really disappointed,"" said Rivers. ""But he has a lot to be proud of. He did a heck of a job in extreme circumstances. I'm probably no prouder of anybody who's played for me and been a coach under me than Ty Lue. It makes me so angry when you see stuff like that, but there's nothing you can do about it. He handled it better than me. He handled it with amazing class, thanked everybody.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Portland Trail Blazers may not need to rely exclusively on their dynamic duo to throw scoring punches any longer. Their new supporting cast trades jabs pretty well, too, and it could make a real difference to their long-term prospects. With Damian Lillard struggling Monday and C.J. McCollum scoring just 17 points, the Blazers got 17 points from Zach Collins and the first career double-double from former Purdue star Caleb Swanigan to put away the Indiana Pacers 103-93. ""They've been great for us all season. They've been keeping us alive all season,"" McCollum said, referring to Portland's bench. ""They're the difference between us being an average team and a really good team."" It's a series Portland has dominated. They've won three straight over Indiana and eight of the last nine, largely behind the play of Lillard who had scored at least 33 points in three of his six previous trips to Bankers Life Fieldhouse. And Lillard was coming off back-to-back 40-point games. This time the All-Star guard missed his first five shots, didn't score until the final seconds of the first half and wound up with a season-low 16 points on 5 of 13 shooting with one rebound and two assists. McCollum was 7 of 15 with six rebounds and one assist and they combined for three 3-pointers. In previous seasons, those numbers might have doomed Portland's chances. But Swanigan softened up the Pacers with his early flurry and Collins delivered the knockout punch by repeatedly scoring in the fourth quarter to help Portland pull away. ""The second unit came in and played really well,"" said Collins, who matched his career high scoring total.  ""We ran the lead up and didn't let it go down. In the second half, we did our job."" The result: Indiana lost its first home game of the season with a lackluster performance. Victor Oladipo had 21 points, nine rebounds and seven assists while Darren Collison added a season-high 17. Thaddeus Young added 16 points and Myles Turner had 10 points and nine rebounds on a night coach Nate McMillan hoped to see a stronger performance on defense and on the glass. He wasn't satisfied with much. ""We're still working on establishing ourselves as a team, what works for us as a team -- defending hard, rebounding the ball,"" McMillan said. The Pacers appeared to be cruising early in the second half when they took a 57-49 lead. But the Trail Blazers charged back quickly by scoring five straight points, retook the lead during a 10-2 run and extended their 71-69 advantage by starting the fourth quarter on an 8-2 run. Indiana didn't get closer than five the rest of the way as Swanigan had 11 points and 10 rebounds, both career bests. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Evan Turner, who once played for Indiana, was one of seven players in double figures. He had 13 points. ... Portland committed 18 turnovers, their worst total this season in a non-overtime game, but went 17 of 18 from the free-throw line and had a 50-35 rebounding edge. ... The Blazers drew four offensive foul calls in the first six minutes of the game. Pacers: The free-throw shooting woes continued as the Pacers went 13 of 20 from the line. They were also 6 of 19 on 3s. ... Turner had three blocks to tie James Edwards (391) for No. 8 on the franchise's NBA career list. ... Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri received a blue No. 4 jersey between the first and second quarters in honor of becoming the NFL's career scoring leader Sunday. THEY SAID IT Trail Blazers: ""It was a junky, slow game,"" Lillard said. Pacers: ""Those guys (Lillard and McCollum) can really score at a high level,"" Oladipo said. ""We kind of slowed them down. Unfortunately, we didn't get the win.""","401070768"
"PHILADELPHIA --  After yet another slow start by the 76ers, Ben Simmons gave restless fans and a slumping team a needed reminder of just good they can become in the East. Simmons had 21 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, and turned the game around in the decisive third quarter to lift Philadelphia to a 113-92 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. Simmons made 5 of 6 shots in the third and hit all five free throws for 15 points and helped the 76ers outscore Atlanta 31-13 in the third. ""I think we just needed a spark and I was able to provide that for the team,"" he said. ""I told the guys to keep running with me and I'll find them."" Without a major roster addition, the Sixers had played little like a team that won 52 games and a playoff round a year ago. Simmons and Joel Embiid have been solid and are making early cases for All-Star berths. But Philly's distinguished duo had little help and the Sixers had won their last two games by one and two points, respectively, and needed this win just to move above .500 (4-3). ""I think everybody gets caught up in last season. This is a different team,"" Simmons said. Here's how much expectations have soared in Philly: The Sixers were booed by fans, who showed nothing but love in the early days of ""The Process,"" as they trudged off the court tied at halftime. Simmons turned everyone around. ""He has a second gear a lot of people in this league don't have,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. He got some help in the third from the oft-maligned Markelle Fultz. Fultz, desperately trying to join Simmons and Embiid as a cornerstone trio, had a sweet stretch during which he buried an open 3, crushed a one-handed dunk in transition and had an assist on an Embiid jumper for a 78-60 lead. Fultz had season-highs with seven baskets (on 16 attempts) and 16 points in 23 minutes. ""I'm a great basketball player,"" Fultz said. ""I think I can do pretty much anything. I can pass the ball, I can pull up the 3, I can get to the rim. I just think I have an all-around game."" That was enough to help send Atlanta to its second straight loss. Kent Bazemore led the Hawks with 18 points. ""We still had energy, but it's their own court and they definitely fed off the energy from the crowd, made a few shots, and got on a few big runs,"" Hawks guard Trae Young said. ""We weren't able to stop them."" The Sixers aren't much more than Embiid and Simmons and some needed 3s from JJ Redick. The Hawks sagged off Fultz most of the game and dared him to shoot jumpers. Dario Saric, one of the early parts of ""The Process,"" has seemingly lost his shot, much the same way Fultz did. Saric missed all seven shots in the first half (including four 3s) and finished 1 of 9 overall for four points. ""He looked heavy-legged to me,"" coach Brett Brown said. TIP-INS Hawks: The Hawks were outrebounded 64-47. ... Hit just eight 3s. ... Shot 37 percent from the floor. 76ers: Brown said Wilson Chandler's return from an injured left hamstring is not far off. ... Movie director M. Night Shyamalan was at the game. ... Mike Muscala hit four 3s. WELCOME BACK Pierce made a homecoming of sorts after spending five years on Brown's staff with the Sixers. Pierce said he owed Brown so much for helping him become a head coach. ""He's passionate. He's got energy all the time,"" Pierce said. ""He cares about the players."" Pierce said he's kept in touch with Brown and former players who have wished him well in his new gig. ""These guys are happy I'm in the position that I'm in,"" Pierce said. Brown said having a coaching tree was one of the responsibilities of the job. FULTZ FOCUS Fultz, the No. 1 pick of the 2017 draft, had a nice spin move and hit an 8-footer in the lane in the second quarter and seemed most confident running the show and not playing with Simmons. ""There is zero doubt in my mind that it's his best position now,"" Brown said. ""What can he be? What he can grow to? I don't know. But his position now is with the ball and as a point guard."" FAMILIAR FACES Hawks rookie Omari Spellman is coming off a national championship at Villanova and third-year forward DeAndre' Bembry from Saint Joseph's both had plenty of local fans in the house. Pierce said Bembry is playing with confidence after missing chunks of his first two seasons with injuries. ""He's happy he's getting an opportunity to play,"" Pierce said. Pierce said Spellman was making an impact, even with spotty minutes. But not every hoops fan in Philly is part of Nova Nation. One fan yelled out, ""Spellman, you're a D-League player!""","401070769"
"MIAMI --  Sacramento's offensive approach was not exactly elaborate: Run, run, run and keep running. Once the Kings got rolling, Miami had no answers. Willie Cauley-Stein scored 26 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, Buddy Hield added 23 points and the high-octane Kings put their youthful athleticism on full display in getting past the Heat 123-113 on Monday night -- putting up huge numbers even after sputtering through the first quarter. ""We ain't had this energy in a while here, so this energy is just refreshing,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""It's fun to play like this, playing fast, everyone getting the touches, everybody sharing the energy. It's just fun to play."" De'Aaron Fox scored 20 points and Nemanja Bjelica added 19 for the Kings, who outscored Miami 77-55 in the middle two quarters and won on the Heat's home floor for the second consecutive season. The Kings outscored Miami 68-38 in the paint, and 27-9 off turnovers. ""You've got some teams that are special offensively,"" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. ""That team ... they're just go-go-go. That was like a conditioning test out there. They're using their strengths as a team. That's the league, man."" Josh Richardson scored a career-high 31 points for Miami, which got an NBA season-high 24 rebounds from Hassan Whiteside, one shy of his career high. Whiteside also had 16 points and five blocked shots for the Heat. ""We like to play at pace, but it has to be on our terms,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And that was fully on their terms."" It was tied at the half, and Sacramento ran away in the third. Hield had 14 points in the third quarter, six of them starting what became a 14-4 Kings run that gave them an 82-65 lead. Cauley-Stein added 11 in that pivotal quarter, one where the Kings put up 43 points -- their best one-period total in nearly three years. ""I was running the floor and my teammates were finding me in rhythm,"" Hield said. ""That was the big thing."" Goran Dragic scored 20 and Tyler Johnson had 11 for Miami, which led 28-17 after the first and was outscored by 21 the rest of the way. ""The biggest part about early in the game is we didn't go away,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said.

This is only the second time in the last 12 years that Sacramento (4-3) has had a winning record after seven games. The Kings were 5-2 at this point in 2014-15. Heat: Miami has scored at least 90 points in each of its last 37 regular-season-games, tying the franchise record (done twice previously, most recently in the 2004-05 season). ... It was the first -- and last -- time that Wade played in what became a home loss to Sacramento.

"NEW YORK --  His mouth bloodied, Tim Hardaway Jr. ran to the locker room shortly before halftime. Then he came back and helped the Knicks run all over the Nets. Hardaway scored 25 points and tied a career high with eight assists, and New York rolled to its second win of the season, beating Brooklyn 115-96 on Monday night. Frank Ntilikina added 16 points and Enes Kanter had 15 points and 15 rebounds off the bench for the Knicks, who had dropped five straight since beating Atlanta in their first game under David Fizdale. ""He preaches competitors only when you step through these doors, so we can't only preach it we've got to go out and do it,"" Hardaway said after removing a blood-stained pad from his mouth so he could talk. ""So we did it tonight."" They ended their skid emphatically, outscoring the Nets 59-41 over the middle two quarters and leading by as many as 25 points. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 17 points for the Nets, who dropped their third straight. They were coming off a close loss to Golden State on Sunday, and either didn't have legs left or didn't put forth much effort, getting beaten to loose balls and unable to slow the Knicks in transition in the third quarter. ""We weren't ready to play,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We can look for excuses, but this is game five (actually seven). This isn't game 74. We should have been more ready."" The Nets beat the Knicks 107-105 on Oct. 19 on Caris LeVert's layup with a second to play. This time, LeVert was 2 for 11 for just four points. The game began to swing just before halftime, when Hardaway had a couple baskets in an 8-0 spurt that pushed a two-point edge to 52-42. He also was hit in the mouth during that span while drawing an offensive foul and ran to the locker room to get his lip glued so he could return for the second half. When he did, the Knicks put it away quickly. Rookie Mitchell Robinson's steal and dunk capped a quick run of six points that made it 58-44 and led to a Nets timeout that did nothing to halt the Knicks' momentum. Hardaway made a 3 and soon after threw one of his best passes, a lob that Robinson slammed down to make it 69-48. ""I think Tim has always had the reputation that he's just a gunner and so I want to break that stereotype of him,"" Fizdale said. ""And to be an elite player in this league you have to make other people better."" The Nets took their third timeout of the quarter when Damyean Dotson made a layup while being fouled as the lead ballooned to 75-50. TIP-INS Nets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 16 points. ... Brooklyn was 11 for 38 (29 percent) from 3-point range after making 44.3 percent over its last five games. Knicks: Fizdale kept the same starting lineup he used Friday against Golden State, with Hardaway, Ntilikina, Dotson and Robinson joined by Noah Vonleh. RASHEED'S ROLE Rasheed Wallace, who finished his career with the Knicks in 2013, was in practice over the weekend and worked with rookie big man Robinson. Fizdale called Wallace one of the smartest players he's ever been around and hoped he could teach the second-round pick how to be vocal on defense. Fizdale added that Wallace would be with the team a couple more days and he'd like to have other veterans work with his young team, saying the Knicks have talked to Chauncey Billups about coming. CARIS CRASHES LeVert had a career-high 28 points in the first meeting. He came in averaging 21.3 points and shooting 51.6 percent from the field. ""The good thing about the NBA is a day off and we play again on Wednesday and a chance to redeem myself,"" he said.","401070771"
"CHICAGO --  Klay Thompson popped to the wing off a screen from Stephen Curry, caught the pass from Kevin Durant and dribbled to his left before launching the record 3-pointer. The ball swished through the net. He raised both arms, pumped his fist and got mobbed. Thompson broke Curry's NBA record with 14 3-pointers and finished with 52 points to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 149-124 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday night. Thompson set the mark when he nailed a 3 with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter. He celebrated with teammates as they headed to the sideline for a timeout, with the Warriors leading 113-69. Curry hit 13 3-pointers in a win over New Orleans on Nov. 7, 2016. ""That's what I do this for is those moments that you share with your teammates,"" Thompson said. ""That's why we play basketball. It's a collective effort. And I don't know if I would be able to break these records I have gotten in my past like tonight without the system I play in or the team I play with, the guys I play with."" Thompson hadn't scored more than 19 this season and made just 5 of 36 3-pointers in the Warriors' first seven games. But he broke out in a huge way, making 14 of 24 from beyond the arc. And he did it in just 26 minutes before sitting out the fourth quarter.  About the only thing that slowed down Thompson on Monday night was when he suffered a cut above his right eye that needed two stitches in the third quarter. He returned a few minutes later sporting a yellow headband. The four-time All-Star guard hit 10 3's and scored 36 as Golden State built a 92-50 halftime lead. It was the second-highest scoring half ever by an NBA team. Phoenix had 107 in the first half of a 173-143 victory over Denver in 1990. The Warriors also set an NBA record for 3-pointers in a half with 17 through the first two quarters. ""This is what it's been like,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""I can't even tell you how lucky I am and how I feel every night watching these guys, how unselfish they are."" Curry scored 23. Kevin Durant had 14 points and eight assists. And Chicago product Alfonzo McKinnie added 19 points and 10 rebounds as the two-time defending NBA champions improved to 7-1. Zach LaVine and Antonio Blakeney led the Bulls with 21 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. scored 18. Chicago probably would have been overmatched even at full strength. But with Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine all out with injuries, this one got ugly in a hurry because of Thompson. ""He was due for a game like this,"" LaVine said. ""He saw one go in, and his eyes got as big as the basketball. It's tough after that, because they're looking for him. He's running off of screens, and you can't touch him anyway. It's tough."" Thompson nailed his first three 3-pointers and made six while scoring 22 in the first quarter. By the time the second half rolled around, the Warriors were determined to see him set the mark. And it seemed teammates were doing all they could to assist on the record shot. Durant was glad it was him. ""The most important thing was I passed it to him on his 14th,"" he said. ""And I also passed it to Steph on his 13th. ... They wouldn't have made those shots without me."" Actually, Draymond Green had the assist on Curry's record 13th 3 against New Orleans two years ago. Either way, this was quite a night. ""It's the best feeling in basketball or one of the best feelings in basketball when you touch the ball and feel like it's going in every time,"" Thompson said. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston missed his second consecutive game because of a sore right foot. He also missed two in a row last week because of a bruised left knee. ... McKinnie hit 4 of 6 3-pointers in his second NBA game in his hometown. As a rookie with Toronto last season, he played about five minutes in a game at Chicago. Bulls: Former Bulls C Joakim Noah got a standing ovation when he was shown on the video board late in the first half. He was waived by the New York Knicks with two years and $37.8 million remaining on his contract on Oct. 13.","401070772"
"MILWAUKEE --  No Giannis Antetokounmpo, no problem for the Milwaukee Bucks. With the way they're shooting from the 3-point line, the Bucks look like they can beat just about anybody in the NBA. Ersan Ilyasova scored a season-high 19 points and the Bucks cruised without the injured Antetokounmpo to beat the Toronto Raptors 124-109 on Monday night in a showdown of the NBA's last undefeated teams. Milwaukee improved to 7-0 in a marquee matchup that lost some luster with Antetokounmpo in concussion protocol and Raptors star Kawhi Leonard sitting out to rest. The Bucks' start to the season matches the 1971-72 club for best in franchise history. Milwaukee made up for Antetokounmpo's absence with another strong showing from the perimeter, with Malcolm Brogdon and Eric Bledsoe chipping in 17 points each. ""Of course we have more confidence when (Antetokounmpo) is on the floor,"" Brogdon said. ""But we have a lot of confidence even when he's not on the floor due to the system and due to the confidence that (coach Mike Budenholzer) gives us."" Serge Ibaka scored 30 points for Toronto, which had its franchise-best 6-0 start snapped. Pascal Siakam added 22. They still couldn't keep up with the Bucks, who eclipsed the 110-point mark for the seventh straight game even without the high-flying Antetokounmpo, who averages 25.0 points and 14.2 rebounds. Ilyasova, starting for Antetokounmpo, helped pick up the slack, setting the tone with an active night all over the floor and adding a team-high 10 rebounds. The Bucks didn't stop moving when they had the ball either, especially at the 3-point line. Milwaukee's 19 3-pointers tied a franchise record which was previously reached just three days ago against Minnesota. ""They dictated the tempo of the game tonight,"" Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. It was the first game in NBA history between teams with a record of 6-0 or better, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. FIRE AWAY Budenholzer wants his team to hoist 3-pointers, and an 11-3 run in the fourth quarter sparked by two 3s from Khris Middleton helped turn a 15-point advantage into a 113-90 lead with 7:39 left. The philosophy calls for 3s and proper spacing among the five players on the floor to help create 1-on-1 opportunities for Antetokounmpo. It's working without him, too. Seven players scored in double figures. ""When they see advantages, they are seeing opportunities within the confines of what we do and still trying to play unselfishly,"" Budenholzer said. NO HELP Raptors coach Nick Nurse said his team needed better help defense to stop the Bucks' cuts and straight-line drives. When the Bucks weren't taking it straight to the hoop, they were kicking the ball out for perimeter shots. ""It's a little difficult with the five-out spacing to get adjusted,"" Nurse said. ""It's not easy to guard the ball 1-on-1 in this league. It gets harder all the time."" GOING COLD The Bucks' defense tightened after allowing the Raptors to start 12 of 17 (70 percent) from the floor with 2:37 left in the first quarter. Toronto went on to shoot 31 percent from that point to the fourth quarter, when the Bucks' lead swelled to 15. ""When you're trying to get back in it and they don't go in you automatically say, `Aw man, they're shooting too much,"" Nurse said. ""But I really thought we fought and tried to stay in it."" TIP INS Raptors: Leonard was expected to sit out just Monday's game. ... Toronto went about a four-minute stretch between the first and second quarters shooting 1 of 10 from the floor to fall behind by nine with 10:06 left in the second. Bucks: Antetokounmpo was injured Saturday against Orlando. ... Ilyasova (14 points) and Thon Maker (11) were active up front in the first half to help make up for the absence of Antetokounmpo, who cheered on his teammates one row behind the bench. ... Asked what he was most surprised by in the Bucks' fast start, Budenholzer said ""I'm not a big surprise guy. I'm just happy with the way they've worked every day. It's been a good steady work ethic.""","401070773"
"LeBron James talks about the Lakers' tendency to lose in close games and the patience he maintains as a leader. (1:18) MINNEAPOLIS --  After a lethargic loss in their last game, the Minnesota Timberwolves came to life. LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers served as their spark plug. Jimmy Butler hit five of Minnesota's eight 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to finish with 32 points on 12-for-20 shooting and help the Timberwolves hang on to beat the Lakers 124-120 on Monday. ""They were playing fast, which made us play with a lot of energy, so I guess their energy kind of helped ours,"" Butler said. Karl-Anthony Towns pitched in 25 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and four blocks for the Timberwolves (3-4), who played some clutch defense just in time to fend off a late push from James. The four-time MVP had 10 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter after missing his first five shots of the night, but the Lakers (2-5) went back to Los Angeles with another uneven performance. ""We've got to get better. We know that. We talk about patience, but we can't have reoccurrence of doing the same things over and over and over again and expecting a different result,"" said James, who added 10 rebounds and seven assists on the 15th anniversary of his professional debut. ""That's insanity."" Brandon Ingram came back strong from his four-game suspension with 24 points for the Lakers. Kyle Kuzma, after scoring 11 points in the first five minutes, had only eight more over the rest of the night. The Lakers let the Wolves grab a season-high 20 offensive rebounds and committed 18 turnovers. Anthony Tolliver was perfect on four shots from the floor for the Timberwolves, including a 3-pointer to start the fourth quarter for a 96-94 lead. Butler's back-to-back swishes from behind the arc pushed the lead to 114-107. He added one more, his fifth in as many attempts in the final period, to make it 122-117. That preceded a corner miss with 16.3 seconds left by James, who had a costly turnover with 1:43 remaining when he lost the ball at the top of the key and let it drift into the backcourt. ""We've got to get better at the little things. One of those things is paying attention to details, following game plans. The game plan tonight: Keep them off the free throw line, and defensive rebounding,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""They hurt us with both of those."" BETTER EFFORT Rookie Josh Okogie, starting at shooting guard for the Wolves in place of the injured Andrew Wiggins, had a career-high 17 points. The defensive-minded Okogie was one of the catalysts for a team that lost at home to Milwaukee by 30 points on Friday night. ""Shots are going to fall. Shots aren't going to fall. But we have to have that energy every single night, and that's what's going to get us through those humps,"" said Okogie, who added four rebounds, three assists and three steals in 30 minutes. Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau remained noncommittal on keeping Okogie as part of the rotation when Wiggins is back. ""He makes things happen,"" Thibodeau said. ""He's not perfect, but he's learning, he's eager and every day he comes in with a great attitude, and I like that he's taking advantage of when he does play."" INGRAM IS IN The Lakers went with a new starting lineup to maximize their length, sliding the 6-foot-9 Ingram back to the shooting guard spot and flanking James with the sharpshooting Kuzma at power forward. They entered the night with a league-leading 22 percent of their points coming on fast breaks, but the Wolves outscored them 21-15 in transition. Ingram was 9 for 18 from the floor. ""I didn't feel tired out there,"" Ingram said. ""That was surprising."" TIP-INS Lakers: Backup forward Michael Beasley was away from the team to tend to a personal matter. He has appeared in three games, logging a total of 10 minutes. He's with his seventh different team in his 11th NBA season. ... The largest lead for the Lakers, 90-85, came on Lance Stephenson's 3-pointer with 3:28 left in the third. Timberwolves: Wiggins took part in the morning shootaround but was held out for the third straight game with the strained right quadriceps that stopped his consecutive regular-season games played streak at 243. ... Rose had 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists but missed 12 of 16 shots from the field. ... Taj Gibson had three of the team's 12 blocks, tying a season high.","401070774"
"SAN ANTONIO --  DeMar DeRozan picked himself off the court after missing a potential game-winning shot and then lifted the San Antonio Spurs, too. DeRozan had 34 points and nine assists and San Antonio withstood a 31-point outburst by Dallas rookie Luka Doncic in a 113-108 overtime victory over the Mavericks on Monday night. ""He's a really good player and he loves those moments,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of DeRozan. ""He's not afraid of failure. You know, Michael (Jordan) didn't make every shot at the end of the game, but there are very, very few people who want to be in that position all the time and (DeRozan's) one of those people who loves it. It's good to have that."" LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points and Rudy Gay had 15 points and 11 rebounds as San Antonio won its second overtime game. Popovich said Aldridge and Gay were his closers last season, but DeRozan has given the Spurs another option, and they needed it against Doncic. Dallas' 6-foot-7 wing was 11 for 18 from the field in scoring a season high. ""He's a very good player,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He certainly doesn't look surprised that this is happening."" DeRozan and Doncic battled in the final minutes of regulation and into overtime in a game that included 10 lead changes and 12 ties. DeRozan scored 18 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, while Doncic had 10 points in the same span. DeRozan made two free throws to give the Spurs a 102-101 lead with 39.1 seconds left in regulation. Doncic missed a driving layup against Aldridge, and DeRozan missed a jumper in the lane. Dennis Smith Jr. was fouled by DeRozan with 1.6 seconds remaining. The Mavericks' point guard made the first free throw, tying the game at 102-all, and missed the second. DeRozan remained sprawled face-first on the court for a few seconds after missing a jumper inside the 3-point line as regulation expired. ""I was mad at myself that I missed,"" DeRozan said. ""But like I said, if I got the opportunity again, I wasn't going to miss a big shot later in the game, and I didn't."" It was one of the few times DeRozan failed to come through on either offense or defense for the Spurs. DeRozan, who was acquired in the offseason from Toronto for Kawhi Leonard, was 12 for 21 from the field and had six rebounds and three steals. With about seven minutes remaining in regulation, DeRozan stole the ball from Wes Matthews, sprinted down court and backed up Matthews before hitting a turnaround, fadeaway jumper from 12 feet for an 89-83 lead. ""I think we have a bunch of guys that are competitive and have the same goal, that's to win,"" Aldridge said. ""I feel like that's not something hard to ask. I feel like every guy is trying to do what they can to make wins."" Smith finished with 22 points for Dallas. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas extended its franchise record to 189 straight games with at least five 3-pointers. The streak began March 9, 2016. .... DeAndre Jordan had 18 rebounds, but was held to eight points, marking the first time he has not had a double-double this season. Spurs: DeRozan has led the Spurs in scoring in all but one game this season. ... San Antonio matched a season low by holding Dallas to 18 points in the opening quarter. The Spurs also held the Lakers to 18 points in the final quarter of Saturday's victory. SO-SO GOOD Doncic played 40 minutes, including 23 in the second half and overtime, despite suffering from a strained back that put his status in question. ""So-so, but I'm not going to stop,"" Doncic said when asked how his back was. Doncic also tweaked his left ankle on a drive late in overtime, but remained in the game. FREQUENT FLYERS The Mavericks flew for the seventh straight night following Monday's loss, their fifth game in seven days. Dallas, which has played three road games since Oct. 22, is 1-4 in that stretch. ""We're in the middle of just a grind week with all this travel,"" Carlisle said. ""To hang in there and play like we did tonight is a real credit to them."" WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN Aldridge was astounded to learn Gay has three consecutive double-doubles for the first time in his career. ""First time in his career,"" Aldridge shouted with Gay nearby. ""What have you been doing all these years?"" Gay chuckled and said it's all about opportunity. ""This year I don't have Dejounte (Murray) and L.A. stealing my rebounds,"" Gay said. ""Now I can get a double-double every night.""","401070775"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets were out of sorts at times on offense -- until it really mattered. They looked lethargic on defense -- until it really, really mattered. Then, they rose to the occasion. More specifically, Gary Harris did. Harris scored nine of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and came up with a big steal late to help the Nuggets hold off the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 116-111 on Monday night after nearly squandering an 18-point lead. The Nuggets are 5-1 despite feeling like they've yet to find their rhythm. That's encouraging to Harris. ""There's a different vibe around the team,"" Harris said. ""Everybody can feel it. ... The defense could've been better tonight. But we keep getting these wins. That's the point of it all -- the wins."" Jamal Murray chipped in 23 points and Nikola Jokic had 12 points and 10 assists for his fifth double-double in six games. Nikola Mirotic came up clutch with 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who were without star Anthony Davis (sprained right elbow) and Elfrid Payton (sprained right ankle). Reserve Julius Randle added 24. Down by 18 points in the third quarter, the Pelicans cut it to 96-94 with 3:50 remaining on a layup from Jrue Holiday. Malik Beasley answered by hitting a 3-pointer and a layup to give the Nuggets all the separation they would need. Harris' steal with 38 seconds remaining wrapped it up as Denver moved to 4-0 at home. ""We knew this team wasn't going to back down,"" said Paul Millsap, who had 18 points. ""It's when we get out there and try to blow teams out is when we kind of get ourselves in trouble. Taking our time and letting the game come to us, that's when we're at our best."" The Pelicans turned the ball over 22 times, including three costly miscues down the stretch. ""You can't do that against a really good defensive team like these guys are,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We just didn't have enough firepower to finish."" Randle's thoughts exactly. ""We just dug ourselves a bit too deep at the end of the first half. That's what got us,"" Randle said. ""This was their home-court and we didn't have enough juice."" Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone warned his team about not taking the Pelicans too lightly just because they were without Davis. His message apparently didn't take root, and Denver trailed by nine points during the opening quarter. The Nuggets woke up from their slumber in the second quarter and grabbed a 58-45 lead at the break and ran the lead to 18 in the third before the Pelicans rallied. ""It's not about who we're playing. It's not about who's available,"" Malone said. ""It's about us."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Gentry said Davis is still experiencing some pain in his elbow and was held out for a second straight game as a precaution. ""I don't think it's anything that we're worried about,"" Gentry said. ... Holiday hit 2 of 3 3-pointers before fouling out. He entered the game 3 of 22. Nuggets: Reserve Trey Lyles had 17 points with his father in the stands. NIKOLA VS. NIKOLA In a faceoff of two big men with the first name Nikola, Jokic and Mirotic put on quite a show. Jokic finished a rebound shy of his second triple-double of the season. Meanwhile, Mirotic knocked down shot after shot in crunch time. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT The Nuggets took advantage of a three-day break to focus on shooting. They rank near the bottom in 3-point percentage. ""Throughout the NBA season in practice, one of the last things you do is shoot. You're working on offense, you're working on defense, special situations,"" Malone explained. ""Hopefully all that repetition will help us finally make some shots."" The team was 11 of 35 from 3-point range. CRUNCH TIME Beasley is getting more playing time with Will Barton out following surgery to fix his hip/core muscle. Beasley was in late in the fourth quarter, which was an eye-opener for him. ""I looked at the scoreboard with two minutes to go and was like, `Wow, I'm out here,"" Beasley said.","401070776"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Before the season, Tony Parker told his new Hornets teammates, ""Don't mess with my playoff streak."" He wasn't kidding. ""I was serious, because it means something,"" Parker said. ""I feel like I'm a winner. I have won a lot in this league. And I think that is why they signed me."" Parker is doing his best to make sure the Hornets get to the postseason, which would allow the longtime San Antonio Spur to reach the playoffs for the 18th straight season. Parker had 24 points and 11 assists to lead a big night from Charlotte's bench, and the Hornets beat the Miami Heat 125-113 on Tuesday night. In so doing, the 36-year-old Frenchman surpassed 19,000 career points and became the seventh international-born player to reach that milestone -- joining Dirk Nowitzki, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dominique Wilkins, Tim Duncan, Patrick Ewing and Pau Gasol. ""This is a four-time NBA champion, a lot of pride, a lot of credibility. He wants to win, and he's not satisfied with this win,"" said Hornets coach James Borrego, who also coached Parker as an assistant with the Spurs. Behind Parker, who provided a spark all game long with his scoring, passing and decision-making, Charlotte's reserves outscored Miami's 66-46. Reserve Malik Monk had 20 points and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist contributed 14 points and eight rebounds for the second unit. Nic Batum had 20 points for the Hornets, who beat the Heat for the second time in 10 days. Kemba Walker was held to a season-low 19 points, but played a big role by helping squash a fourth-quarter comeback sparked by Dwyane Wade, who led Miami with 19 points and made four 3-pointers. Walker knocked down a pair of 3s in the final 3 1/2 minutes to push Charlotte's lead back to double digits. Batum said Parker is ""just what we needed off the bench."" ""We needed that guy behind Kemba that can control the game and can push off of Kemba -- and he's doing good so far,"" said Batum, who has played with Parker on the French national team. ""I think his poise, his demeanor, his pace, it just calms everybody down,"" Borrego said of Parker. ""People find the right spots. They're in rhythm. It's not helter-skelter. He's got great rhythm there. He's been doing this for 17 years. This is a pro who has played at the highest level in big competitions and he's not fazed out there."" TIP-INS Heat: Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 12 rebounds. ... Were outrebounded 39-34 by the smaller Hornets. Hornets: The Hornets exercised their third-year option on Monk before the game. The 6-foot-3 Monk came in averaging 11 points per game in his second NBA season. He was selected 11th overall in the 2017 draft. BACK-TO-BACK WOES It was the second loss in two nights for the Heat, who gave up 123 points to the Kings on Monday. Coach Erik Spoelstra called it ""a disappointing two games."" ""Every time we had any type of momentum they just took it the other way,"" Spoelstra said. ""You have to credit them, they came out and played with great purpose and flattened us out offensively even though we scored 113. Defensively they annihilated us and broke our defense down without much resistance."" Wade didn't have an answer for Miami's defensive struggles, saying ""we've played aggressive and we've played kind of the style of defense we want to play when we get down, but we haven't done it consistently. That's the biggest thing is trying to find consistency."" TOUGH TO STOP Borrego said he is thrilled with the improvement from Monk in his second season. Monk was on the floor during a crucial stretch in the fourth quarter with Parker and Walker -- and wasn't afraid to shoot. The former Kentucky star finished 7 of 10 from the floor with four 3-pointers. ""That's tough to guard,"" Borrego said of the trio. ""There's shooting out there, there's playmaking out there, the court was spread and we're not only going to need him throughout the game, but the fourth quarter is a major time and that kid isn't afraid of the moment.""","401070777"
"CLEVELAND --  The Cavaliers played unselfishly, aggressively and together for the first time this season. They almost always do for Larry Drew. Rodney Hood scored a season-high 26 points, Cedi Osman added 20 and Cleveland ended its six-game losing streak to start the season, beating the Atlanta Hawks 136-114 on Tuesday night in the Cavs' first game since coach Tyronn Lue was fired. Cleveland came in as the NBA's only winless team, and Lue paid the price for club's slow start in its first season since LeBron James left the Cavs for the second time. But with Drew serving as their ""acting"" coach while he tries to get the team to restructure his contract, the Cavs played a complete game -- Cleveland had seven players in double figures -- and avoided their first 0-7 start since 1995-96. ""I really didn't know what was going to happen tonight,"" Drew said. ""I just wanted these guys to try and put the first six games behind them as quickly as they could and be ready to turn the chapter with a new season. They came out and took the challenge."" The Cavs improved to 10-1 in the past two years under Drew, who filled in last season while Lue battled health issues. Before the game, Drew said he was ""very disappointed"" the Cavs had not yet agreed to his request to redo his deal if he's going to lead them through what promised to be a challenging season. If Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert or GM Koby Altman needed further proof that Drew has his players' attention, they got it. ""L.D. always has had a voice,"" Hood said. ""Not as big a voice, but he's a guy who's been through the wars and he knows how to put guys in position to be successful. I think it was more about us forgetting the first six games and coming out, just playing well. Regardless of the results, let's just play well. Tonight was a good step in that."" George Hill and rookie Collin Sexton scored 17 apiece, and Tristan Thompson had 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Rookie Trae Young scored 24 and Alex Len 22 for the Hawks. Young scored a season-high 35 against the Cavs on Oct. 21, wrecking their home opener. But Atlanta made 22 turnovers and the Hawks' defense was poor in the second half when the Cavs scored 78 points. ""Tale of two halves,"" Young said. ""Started out the game, matched their effort, matched their intensity. We had a really good first half and then they made adjustments. We weren't ready to play and couldn't finish it out."" The Cavs played their third straight game without forward Kevin Love, who could miss several weeks with a painful left toe injury that has bothered him since the preseason opener. The five-time All-Star said doctors are still trying to decide the best course of treatment, and to this point he has not been told he'll need surgery. Until Love's back, the Cavs will have to replace his 19 points and 13.5 rebounds per game. Someone needs to pick up the scoring slack, and Hood could be the guy. He struggled after coming over to Cleveland at the trading deadline from Utah and never found his groove. But he had his best game for Cleveland against the Hawks, attacking the basket and knocking down all four 3-pointers. ""That's the Rodney Hood that I know,"" Drew said. ""Rodney is a passive guy by nature. That's who he is, but he is a very talented and very skilled guy and when he's aggressive like that, he's hard to defend. He can make the 3, turn the corner and get to the basket. When he gets his mid-range game, he really elevates.

ALL-STAR SELECTION The Cavs will host the 2022 NBA All-Star Game, a person familiar with the selection told The Associated Press. The league will make the announcement later this week.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Sacramento has had some success trying to outrun and outscore opponents. Against the Orlando Magic, the Kings turned to defense. Buddy Hield finished with 25 points and the Kings defeated Orlando 107-99 on Tuesday night to extend their winning streak to four games. ""We got six stops in a row,"" said coach David Joerger, referring to a 3  1/2-minute sequence after their 13-point lead was cut to three. ""We had to get some stops and we got those stops. We locked back in and made some plays."" Hield scored six points in a 13-2 run to close out the third quarter, and the Kings held on to match their longest winning streak since February 2017. The Kings' De'Aaron Fox, who played with a sore back, was doubtful until pregame warmups and struggled through a scoreless first half. Fox finished with 14 points, including eight in the fourth quarter. ""I felt like I had a great second half, a forgettable first half,"" said Fox, who added that the back did affect him. ""But I felt like I had to push through it in the second half."" Nemanja Bjelica finished with 21 points for Sacramento, and Willie Cauley-Stein added 14 points and 11 rebounds. Aaron Gordon had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, who lost their third straight. Terrence Ross came off the bench to score 17 points, and Nikola Vucevic finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds. The Magic had assists on each of their first 11 field goals and led through most of the first half. Two 3-pointers by Ross gave Orlando its biggest lead at 27-16 late in the first quarter. Sacramento led for the first time at 55-52 when Bjelica made a 3-pointer with 1:17 left in the first half. The Kings moved out to a 13-point lead before Ross and Jonathon Simmons led a fourth-quarter charge by the Magic, who got as close as 94-91 with 4:50 left. ""The inability to score in the third quarter was the biggest part of the game for us,"" said Magic coach Steve Clifford. ""Our defense ignited our offense in the fourth quarter and gave us a chance, (but) we had a couple of things we need to do better late."" But Orlando's comeback bid fizzled due to seven turnovers in the fourth period and 11-for-43 3-point shooting in the game. ""I just feel like we can never get in control of the game,"" Vucevic said.

""I was taking shots that they were giving me,"" said Irving, who made 10 of 16 shots from the floor and added five assists and five rebounds. ""Me taking some of those shots made the defense come out a little higher, then created some other opportunities for my teammates, which felt good."" Irving's effect on the game showed in the box score as well with four of his teammates also scoring in double figures as the Celtics won their third straight. Jayson Tatum scored 16, Jaylen Brown had 14 points and Al Horford scored 11 for Boston. Marcus Morris had 15 points and nine rebounds. Irving's previous high this season was 22 last Monday against Orlando. He scored just three Saturday when the Celtics beat the Pistons 109-89. ""Law of averages,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's way too good of a scorer for the ball not to go in very long and all that stuff evens out over time."" Blake Griffin had 24 points and 15 rebounds for Detroit, which couldn't recover after scoring just 13 points in the third quarter. The Pistons chopped Boston's 14-point lead down to a point with 4:21 left to play, and then again with 12 seconds remaining, but couldn't complete the comeback. ""I like how we played in stretches tonight. Playing at home, getting beat by 25,whatever it was, and then coming out and giving this type of effort is promising,"" Griffin said. ""That's what we have to do. We might not be as talented as some of these teams in the East, but we have enough talent. What's going to set us apart is our will and how we go about putting our will on the game."" Boston is still the only team to beat the Pistons this season. Andre Drummond had 17 points and 12 rebounds and Reggie Bullock scored 16 for Detroit. Ish Smith added 13 points off the bench and gave Detroit one more chance on a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left to play, pulling Detroit within 103-102. But the Celtics sealed it from the foul line. Tatum drew a foul and made both free shots with 10.5 seconds left, then Irving added two more from the line after Detroit turned the ball over on the inbound play. The Pistons led 58-56 after a high-paced first half, but fell off in the third quarter, going 4 for 17 from the floor and missing all six attempts from 3-point range. Irving took over in the third, scoring 13 and starting an early 10-0 run that put Boston up for good. ""We had to pick our energy level up,"" Brown said. Griffin hit a pair of free throws with 4:38 left in the period to pull Detroit within 70-65, but Irving responded for the Celtics with three straight 3-pointers as Boston stretched the lead to 14 points late in the period. Drummond got Detroit back in it in the fourth quarter after Griffin drove for a layup that cut Boston's lead to 88-84 with 6:01 left to play. Drummond drove for a dunk, blocked a shot by Tatum at the other end and was there to tip in a miss by Stanley Johnson to pull within 90-88. The Celtics thought Drummond interfered with the ball while it was on the rim and called for a replay, which didn't happen but did get coach Brad Stevens a technical for coming out on the court to argue. Bullock made the foul shot to pull Detroit within a point, but Boston responded again with six straight points. ""I love our fight,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""Like I told the team, we put that type of intensity and fight every night, and that's what we ask, you put yourself in position to win."" TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond and Griffin scored 12 points apiece in the first half. ... The Pistons exercised the club option on the contract of G Luke Kennard through next season. Kennard was inactive Tuesday with a sprained right shoulder. ... Detroit outscored Boston 30-25 in the second quarter and led 58-56 at halftime. ... Griffin picked up his fourth foul with 2:22 left in the third quarter. Celtics: Irving's previous season high was 22 points. ... F Daniel Theis was out with a plantar fascia tear in his right foot. ... Horford was called for a three-second violation twice in the first quarter.","401070780"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard turned in another strong effort at both ends of the floor, and the Raptors responded well after their first loss of the season. Leonard scored 31 points, Pascal Siakam had 15 points and a career-high 15 rebounds, and the Raptors rolled past Philadelphia 129-112 on Tuesday night, handing the 76ers their 12th consecutive defeat north of the border. Kyle Lowry had 20 points and 13 assists, extending his streak of double-digit assist games to a career-best six. ""Nice bounce back,"" Lowry said. ""Good win."" Jonas Valanciunas scored a season-high 23 points and Serge Ibaka had 16 as the Raptors set a season high in points and broke a franchise record with their sixth straight home win to begin the year. Leonard led Toronto with four steals and the Raptors had 13 in all, hounding Philadelphia into a season-worst 23 turnovers. ""It's just his natural instinct for getting his hands on stuff,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Leonard. ""The ball is popping around and boom, he comes out of there with it."" Ben Simmons narrowly missed a triple-double, finishing with 11 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, but also committed 11 turnovers. Asked afterward about Leonard's defensive abilities, Simmons called the Toronto star ""a freak."" ""His hands are huge, he's got long arms,"" Simmons said. ""He's a great defender."" Leonard returned to Toronto's lineup after sitting out Monday's loss at Milwaukee, the second time this season he has been rested in one half of a back-to-back. The two-time Defensive Player of the Year was limited to nine games with San Antonio last season because of a quadriceps injury. Leonard did not speak to reporters after the game because he was lifting weights. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown, who spent more than a decade on San Antonio's staff, said he's not shocked by Leonard's return from the injury. ""To see Kawhi playing basketball at the level that he's playing, it does not surprise me,"" Brown said. Leonard has scored at least 20 in all six games he's played this season. He shot 10-for-19 against Philadelphia and went 9-for-10 at the free throw line. Joel Embiid scored 31 points, Robert Covington had 15 and JJ Redick scored 13 as the 76ers lost for the first time in three games. Philadelphia is 0-4 on the road. ""We just need to get one,"" Simmons said. Philadelphia trailed by as many as 26 in the third quarter before fighting back. Embiid cut the deficit to six, 117-111, on a 3-pointer with 3:29 remaining. After a timeout, Toronto responded with a 7-0 run that was capped by a 3 from Leonard with 1:56 left. Toronto's home winning streak against the Sixers is the second-longest against a single opponent in franchise history, eclipsed only by an active 15-game streak against Minnesota. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid had 11 rebounds. ... Philadelphia had eight turnovers in the first quarter and 14 in the opening half, including seven by Simmons. ""It's borderline impossible to win when you have that many,"" Brown said. ... The Sixers have not won in Toronto since a 93-83 victory on Nov. 10, 2012. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (sprained left big toe) missed his fourth straight game. ... F OG Anunoby (personal reason) was inactive for the third straight game. ... Toronto outscored Philadelphia 27-12 on the fast break. ... Siakam scored a career-best 22 points at Milwaukee on Monday. TOUCH OF GRAY Earlier Tuesday, the 76ers unveiled their new City Edition uniforms for the season. In a release, the team said the gray sweatsuit-textured jersey and shorts were inspired by the training scenes from the Philadelphia-set ""Rocky"" and ""Creed"" movies. CLOSING IN Damon Stoudamire owns the Raptors franchise record with seven consecutive games of 10 or more assists, a mark that Lowry could match in Toronto's next game.

"HOUSTON --  Coach Mike D'Antoni got tired of answering question after question about what's wrong with the Houston Rockets after they were trounced again Tuesday night. ""I can sit up here and talk for the next five minutes, but we're not playing well. That's the bottom line,"" he said. ""And we've got to figure out why and do a better job."" Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic scored 22 points each, and the Portland Trail Blazers never trailed in a 104-85 rout of the struggling Rockets. The Rockets dropped their fourth straight in their second game without James Harden, who is out with a hamstring injury, to fall to 1-5. After entering the season with eyes on a championship, the Rockets have rarely even been competitive, dropping their four home games by an average of more than 17 points. While the Rockets certainly know they need to improve, they're also quick to point out the season is still young. ""We realize that it's early, and if you run off 10 wins in a row or something like that at some point, this would be an afterthought,"" Chris Paul said. Now they face a season-long five-game road trip where they'll likely be without Harden and fellow starter James Ennis (right hamstring) for at least the first game and possibly more. The Rockets are careful not to point fingers and insist everyone must be better to turn things around. ""We're going to figure this out together,"" Carmelo Anthony said. ""It's not one person."" Portland led by double digits most of the night and was up by 23 entering the fourth quarter. Houston got within 15 with about two minutes left, but that was it in front of a crowd which began steadily streaming out midway through the third quarter. CJ McCollum added 19 points for the Trail Blazers, who improved to 5-2 with their second straight victory. Paul led Houston with 17 points and nine assists in his second game back after a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with the Los Angeles Lakers. While getting Harden back will certainly give the Rockets a boost, Houston's problems extend beyond missing last year's MVP. The Rockets have been unable to get into any kind of rhythm on offense and look lost at times on defense. Their 3-pointers aren't falling, and when they get open looks, they seem to miss a lot of those, too. The Rockets made just 10 of 43 3-pointers on a night they shot 32.3 percent overall. D'Antoni insists his team will be good and that it just needs time to gel. But the man known for his fast-paced, high-flying offenses must be scratching his head at how he can get this team on track after such an awful start. The Trail Blazers had a 15-point lead by halftime and used an 11-3 run to open the third quarter and extend it to 62-39. Nurkic had two dunks in that stretch, and Jake Layman capped the run with a 3-pointer. ""That was really good,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""To get a quick lead and jump out on them like that and get it up to 20, rather than give them any life early, I think that was really important."" Anthony made a layup midway through the quarter to cut the lead to 21, but the Trail Blazers scored the next seven points to make it 76-48 about a minute later. The Rockets committed three fouls, missed two free throws and one basket in that stretch. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Nurkic had 10 rebounds. ... Portland made 8 of 20 3-pointers. ... Maurice Harkless sat out with a left knee injury. Rockets: C Nene, who hasn't played this season, remains out indefinitely with a strained right calf strain. ... F Marquese Chriss, who has been inactive all season because of a sprained left ankle, had four points and two rebounds. ... Ennis missed his third straight game with a strained right hamstring. KEEPING IT LIGHT Despite the tough start, D'Antoni hasn't lost his sense of humor and responded with a joke when asked about his team's record. ""We do have 76 games (left). You can ask the analytical guys but mathematically I think we're still in it,"" he said. ""So, we'll figure it out.""","401070782"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The road trip was really long and not very forgiving for the Washington Wizards, all the way through the closing game in Memphis. With Washington on fumes to close out a five-game trip, the Grizzlies used 20 points from Garrett Temple to send the Wizards to their fourth straight loss with a 107-95 victory on Tuesday night. ""We need to get off the road as fast as possible,"" said guard Bradley Beal, who finished with 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley added 19 points apiece for Memphis, Conley also finishing with seven assists. Shelvin Mack scored 14 points as the Grizzlies won their second straight and opened the season 3-0 at home. John Wall led Washington with 22 points, while Kelly Oubre Jr. finished with 16 points and Otto Porter Jr. contributed 15. An 18-1 run by Memphis to open the second half spelled the demise for Washington. Although there were times the Wizards made it interesting, even cutting the Memphis advantage to four points twice before the midway point of the fourth quarter, they could never overtake the Grizzlies. Memphis maintained the lead with 3-point shooting down the stretch, converting four of their first five in the final frame. ""We didn't want to let (the Wizards) get their mojo back against us,"" said Temple, who scored five straight points after Washington got within four points the last time. ""They've been struggling. We wanted to keep it like that and continue this streak that we've built at home."" Both teams shot well from outside the arc: Memphis converting 13 of 28; Washington 14 of 35. Memphis outscored Washington in the paint 44-30. ""We feel like we have guys that can contribute up and down our lineup,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""It's a long season and, at some point in time, everybody is going to get a shot at it."" But the unsuccessful road trip is weighing on the Wizards. There were indications that players are losing patience with each other. ""There's a little frustration,"" Wall said. ""This isn't the point where we wanted to be."" ""It's not pretty. It's not perfect. Everyone is antsy and frustrated, and nobody is more frustrated than we are in this locker room,"" Beal added. Washington coach Scott Brooks agreed that things are tense, but that it's too early to panic. ""We just started seven games ago. We've got 75 more games,"" he said. ""They say it's a marathon, and it is. We all know that if you've been in this league for a long time. It's a grinding season."" TIP-INS Wizards: Starting F Markieff Morris sat out the game while in concussion protocol. Dwight Howard continued to rehab gluteal soreness. ... Washington's five-game road trip stretched over nine days. The five games are the longest stretch of the season away from home. ...

Memphis currently is 22-22 all-time against Philadelphia. ... The 3-0 home start is the third straight year Memphis won its opening three home games. . Kyle Anderson had 11 rebounds. FOR THE DEFENSE Memphis, which entered the game near the top of the league in steals at 9.8, had 16 against the Wizards, including five by Gasol and four by Anderson. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies committed 17 turnovers compared to 20 for the Wizards. Memphis has had fewer turnovers than its opponents in every game this season.","401070783"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley aren't done yet with their long-running feud. Westbrook scored 32 points and had another run-in with Beverley during the Oklahoma City Thunder's 128-110 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night. The Thunder outscored the Clippers 39-10 in the third quarter, and Westbrook and Beverley provided the only drama in the fourth. Beverley dove at a dribbling Westbrook and made contact just above Westbrook's left knee, and both were issued technicals after jawing in front of the benches. Police officers stepped onto the court to help keep the teams separated. Upon review, Beverley's foul was ruled a flagrant 1. There's plenty of history between the two. Westbrook tore the lateral meniscus in his right knee during the playoffs in 2013 when Beverley, then playing for the Houston Rockets, lunged for the ball as Westbrook prepared to call timeout. Westbrook missed the rest of the playoffs and part of the next season. In March 2014, the first time the two played again, Beverley swiped the ball away from Westbrook after a timeout and drew a technical, and Beverley and Westbrook had to be separated. Westbrook has had a history of knee problems. He had a procedure on his right knee that cost him the preseason and the first two games of the regular season. He didn't directly address Beverley's action on Tuesday. ""I have no comment on it,"" Westbrook said. ""I just know that we won."" Beverley felt like he did nothing wrong, and said his reputation plays a role in the calls he gets. ""I feel like I went for a loose ball,"" he said. ""I don't know. I don't know. I went for a loose ball and the ref looked at it on tape and felt like it was a flagrant, and I've got to accept it."" Westbrook was animated throughout the game. On several occasions, he pretended to rock a baby to sleep. Though Westbrook and his wife have twin girls on the way, it turns out the motion wasn't about them. ""Yeah, you got little kids,"" Westbrook said. ""You got to put them to sleep. You got little kids on you, that's what happens. Little guards."" Paul George had 32 points and 12 rebounds, Steven Adams had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder added 15 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City won its second straight after four losses to start the season. Danilo Gallinari led the Clippers with 27 points, but he scored just four in the second half. Lou Williams scored 17 points and Tobias Harris added 15 for Los Angeles. The Clippers shot 55 percent in the first half to take a 67-54 lead. The Thunder opened the second half on an 8-2 run to trim the Clippers' lead to 69-62 before a timeout. Oklahoma City continued the surge, and a 3-pointer by Jerami Grant finally gave the Thunder a 70-69 lead. Oklahoma City extended the run to 23-2 and took a 77-69 lead. The Thunder led 93-77 at the end of the third quarter. They shot 70 from the field in the period while holding Los Angeles to 24 percent shooting. TIP-INS Clippers: Defeated the Thunder 108-92 on Nov. 19. ... Gallinari was called for a technical in the first quarter, and Marcin Gortat and Avery Bradley were called for techs in the second quarter. ... Mike Scott hit a 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer.

"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie and his teammates are trying to change the perception of the Brooklyn Nets. That is why what transpired at Barclays Center on Wednesday night was so important to the fourth-year guard. ""Because of what we're fighting for. We're trying to be a good team and trying the change the tide of the Nets' teams in the past. You got to know how to get out of rut fast,"" Dinwiddie said after making a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left in overtime to help the Brooklyn Nets beat the Detroit Pistons 120-119. ""(Losses) can string together and it can affect morale and all that other stuff,"" Dinwiddie said. Dinwiddie finished with a season-high 25 points. He was 8 of 15 from the field, including 5 for 9 from 3. Four of his five 3s came in the fourth quarter or overtime. ""I was able to hit a couple shots and help our team win,"" Dinwiddie said. Joe Harris added a season high 23 points, Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen had 19 each, and Jared Dudley finished with 11. The Nets snapped a three-game losing streak to improve to 3-5. ""We've been in this experience a lot,"" Harris said. ""A lot of close (games) last year. A lot of close games to start the season. For us to close one out (and) execute down the stretch-take care of the ball and execute defensively-this is huge in terms of confidence for us and (this is) just a big morale boost whenever you get a win like this."" The Pistons have dropped three straight to fall to 4-3. ""When we were 4-0 nobody was cheering for us and nobody is going to feel sorry for us when we lose three in a row,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We're in a situation where we have each other. We have to pull together and take care of the mental mistakes we're making, and I have to make sure we're getting better shots for our guys where we can execute better offensively."" Blake Griffin led Detroit with 25 points, Andre Drummond had 24 points and 23 rebounds, and Reggie Jackson scored 21 points. After Dinwiddie's late 3-pointer, Griffin missed a fadeaway. ""We just have to lock in,"" said Griffin. ""It's just an effort thing or a concentration thing."" The Nets trailed by as much as 10 in the third quarter, and entered the fourth down 83-77. Brooklyn ended up outscoring the Pistons 33-27 in the fourth quarter, with Dinwiddie hitting a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left to force overtime. ""Thank God for Spencer Dinwiddie,"" Dudley said. TIP-INS: Pistons: Reserve Jose Calderon's 3-pointer with a second left in the first half gave Detroit a 60-54 lead. Calderon finished with eight points, two rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot. Nets: In his second game of the season, Nets power forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had eight points and seven rebounds while playing a reserve role. Backup big man Ed Davis had with 10 points and 10 rebounds. NOT PASSING THE BOARDS During his pregame press conference, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson bemoaned his team's performance on the glass in a 115-96 loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night. In the loss to their crosstown rivals, the Nets were out rebounded 53-32. And Atkinson focused on his guards, who combined for eight rebounds. ""A lot of times our bigs are locked in or boxing out a big, and our guards are not pursuing the ball like they should."" Against the Pistons, Nets guards had 18 rebounds. MIDDLE OF THE ROAD Historically, defense and the Detroit Pistons have been synonymous terms. Through seven games of the Casey Era, Detroit is in the middle of the pack defensively, allowing 111.3 points per game. Offensively, they entered the game scoring 109.7 points per game. ""In today's NBA, scoring is at a premium,"" Casey said before the game. ""The pace is way up. Teams attempting the 3 is way up, so I would say scoring offensively is huge.""","401070785"
"NEW YORK --  After walking into Madison Square Garden dressed as a superhero, Victor Oladipo had to shake off his lingering bronchitis before unleashing his powers on the New York Knicks. Domantas Sabonis was 12-for-12 shooting while matching his career high with 30 points, Oladipo scored 11 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and the Indiana Pacers beat the Knicks 107-101 on Wednesday night. Oladipo, who arrived in a Black Panther costume for Halloween, has been dealing with bronchitis for about a week, and it worsened two days ago. He started off cold Wednesday, scoring five points and picking up three fouls in the first half while feeling short of breath at times. It was all different down the stretch. Indiana trailed 97-94 with 3:08 left before Oladipo got hot. Sabonis hit two free throws, and then Oladipo picked off Tim Hardaway Jr.'s lazy dribble and threw down a breakaway dunk for a 98-97 lead. Indiana scored the next five points, capped by Oladipo's 3-pointer with 1:23 left, to make it 103-97 after the star guard had hit just one of his previous seven 3s. ""Some of the shots I feel like I normally make I wasn't making today,"" Oladipo said. ""So got to find other ways to win, got other ways to impact the game."" Hardaway led the Knicks with 37 points, and Noah Vonleh had 14 points and 10 rebounds. New York has lost six of seven since winning on opening night. Their inability to execute several times coming out of timeouts cost them in the fourth quarter on top of the five turnovers that Indiana converted into eight points. ""Coming out of the timeout we gotta know our plays. We know how the defensive concepts are,"" said Hardaway Jr., who had a career-high seven 3s. ""It is youth, it comes with that."" After Thaddeus Young's hook shot made it 100-97, Knicks coach David Fizdale gathered his group with 1:55 remaining. New York's youthfulness caught up as some of the players weren't aware where they needed to be before Hardaway misfired on a 3-point attempt which led to a 3 from Oladipo to put Indiana up by six. Alonzo Trier's basket cut New York's deficit to 103-101 with 44 seconds left. Indiana called a timeout and almost gave New York the ball back when Bogdan Bogdanovic missed an open 3, but Young recovered the offensive rebound and found Oladipo open in front of the Knicks bench for a 3-pointer. ""Thad stayed alert, got the ball to Victor, and Victor found a rhythm that second half,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Nothing was falling for him early but he stayed with it and made some big shots going down the stretch."" Young had 13 points, 10 rebounds and five steals. BACK IN New York native and former Knicks player Kyle O'Quinn got a nice hand from the Madison Square Garden crowd when he entered late in the second quarter. O'Quinn signed a one-year deal with Indiana after opting out of the final year of his contract in New York. His decision landed him $4.5 million, a $200,000 raise. ""You talk to your agent, you talk to your family, but you have to make it,"" O'Quinn said before the nationally televised game. ""It's the biggest decision I've ever made as far as making a choice in my career. I slept on it, prayed on it.

"CHICAGO --  Paul Millsap knows nobody is perfect in the NBA. The key to being a good team is finding ways to win when not everything is clicking. The 13-year veteran believes that's exactly what the Denver Nuggets did Wednesday night. Nikola Jokic had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Millsap's putback with 0.1 seconds left in overtime gave the Nuggets a 108-107 victory against the Chicago Bulls. Trailing by a point, Denver inbounded the ball with 3.5 seconds remaining. Jokic missed, but Millsap grabbed the rebound and converted a layup off the glass for the winning basket as the Nuggets improved to 6-1. ""All games are not going to be pretty,"" Millsap said. ""You're not going to shoot the lights out all the time, but the way that we're winning games is something special, especially with young guys. ""They're learning how to win without making shots."" Zach LaVine had 28 points and rookie Wendell Carter Jr. scored a career-high 25 for Chicago. LaVine has at least 20 points in a career-best nine straight games, a streak that dates back to last season. It was Carter's second consecutive game establishing a new high. He had 18 points Monday against the Golden State Warriors. ""We have to learn how to win,"" LaVine said. ""We brought it all the way down to the wire, but we fought. It was a bounce back. Still (stinks), though. You play such a good game, you want that result."" After the Nuggets took a 106-104 lead on a 3-pointer by Jokic -- he had eight of Denver's 10 points in overtime -- Justin Holiday answered with a 3 to put Chicago on top 107-106 with 1:26 to play. After giving up 92 first-half points to Golden State on Monday, the Bulls allowed just 51 in the first two quarters but still trailed by three at halftime. Chicago held a 96-90 edge with three minutes left before Denver went on an 8-2 spurt to tie it at 98 with 1:07 left. ""I reminded our guys about the opening night in LA,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We were down six or eight and we never panicked. I said, `Tonight, we're not going to panic, either."" Neither team could convert multiple opportunities in the final minute, sending the game to overtime. KEEP SHOOTING Jokic had nine assists to finish one shy of a triple-double, but was having an off shooting night until the final minutes of regulation and overtime. He made his first three shots in OT -- including a pair of 3-pointers -- before the miss Millsap converted. ""It was unbelievable to see him flip the switch like that, to go from struggling to knocking down 3s in big moments,"" Millsap said. ""He's a special player."" REUNION Denver G Monte Morris played two years under Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg at Iowa State. When Hoiberg made the jump to Chicago in 2016, Morris recalled his former coach told him he'd see him in the NBA. Morris, selected by the Nuggets in the second round (51st overall) of the 2017 draft, was far from a can't-miss prospect. ""You knew he was going to find a way to make it in this league,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's one of the smartest players, highest IQs, I've ever been around."" TIP-INS Nuggets: The team announced Tuesday it picked up next season's option on the rookie-scale contracts of 2016 first-round draft picks Jamal Murray, Juan Hernangomez and Malik Beasley.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  As the final buzzer sounded and his teammates swarmed him on the court, Derrick Rose couldn't help but fight back tears. Rose's emotions were on full display moments after he scored a career-high 50 points in a vintage performance that lifted the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Utah Jazz 128-125 on Wednesday. Given everything he's been through, it was a special night for the 2011 NBA MVP. ""It still didn't even hit me yet,"" he said. ""Words can't explain how I feel right now. It's been a while."" Derailed by injuries for years, Rose walked off serenaded by chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" from the home crowd. The 30-year-old point guard shot 19 of 31 from the field and hit four 3-pointers. He played 41 minutes, his most in nearly two years. ""He has courage, he has humility and he has character,"" said Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who also coached Rose during his prime seasons in Chicago. ""He's been through a lot of adversity. He's maybe one of the most mentally tough people I've ever come across."" Rose had 34 points in the second half and 15 in a tightly contested fourth quarter as the Wolves held off the Jazz, who waived Rose in February after a two-day stint. His basket down low with 30 seconds remaining put Minnesota up for good, and he made two free throws with 13.8 seconds left to make it a three-point lead. ""He made a lot of plays, made some tough shots,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We had some breakdowns, a little bit of everything."" Jae Crowder and Joe Ingles each missed a 3-pointer that could have tied it for Utah. Rose then blocked a 3-point try by Dante Exum with 2.7 seconds to go, and the Timberwolves grabbed the loose ball to seal it. Back in the locker room, excited teammates doused Rose in celebration. One of his biggest shots was a corner 3 that tied the game at 119. That gave him 44 points, which matched his previous high set during the 2011 playoffs with the Bulls. His regular-season best had been 42 points. Rose tied it at 110 with one of his patented layups, giving him 41 points. He weaved through traffic and made the off-balance shot, showing glimpses of the moves that once made him an elite player and the top pick in the 2008 draft. ""He was feeling great and when you start feeling great you get some extra energy, you get some extra adrenaline and you make amazing plays and that's what he did the whole game,"" Utah center Rudy Gobert said. Making his first start of the season, Rose scored 19 points in the third quarter as the Timberwolves took a five-point lead into the fourth. Karl-Anthony Towns added nine of his 28 points in the period. Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points and Gobert added 22 for Utah. Crowder provided 18 points off the bench. Mitchell did not play in the final 4:22 because of right hamstring tightness and will be re-evaluated Thursday. The Wolves put the Jazz on the free throw line plenty in the fourth quarter. After 11 attempts through three periods, Utah was 13 of 19 from the line in the fourth. Minnesota played without All-Star Jimmy Butler, as well as point guards Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones. Butler sat out with what the team described as ""general soreness."" Butler, who has been the main story line in Minnesota for much of the early season due to his trade request, reportedly plans to play Friday at Golden State. The Timberwolves got Andrew Wiggins back after he missed three games with a quadriceps injury. Wiggins had missed just one total game in his first four seasons before his recent setback. He scored 19 points on 8-of-17 shooting. TIP-INS Jazz: G Alec Burks (left hand sprain) did not play. Burks also did not play Sunday at Dallas. ... Utah is 4-1 on the road this season and 0-2 at home. ... Gobert had his third straight game with 20-plus points and 10-plus rebounds. Timberwolves: Thibodeau said Teague underwent an MRI but was awaiting more tests. Teague is day-to-day. ... Jones was a late scratch with right foot soreness he experienced during warmups. ... The Wolves debuted their ""Classic Edition"" jerseys, a throwback to the uniforms the team wore from 1996-2008.","401070788"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Steve Kerr scratched of his head when asked why Stephen Curry is shooting the ball so well at the start of his 10th NBA season. ""It's, um, I don't know,"" Kerr said. No question Golden State's coach is getting a thrill watching No. 30's hot hand -- as in 52.9 percent from 3-point range through nine games. Curry scored 37 points with seven 3-pointers for his sixth 30-point game of the season and dished out nine assists, and the Warriors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 131-121 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight win. ""I've always said I want to continue to try to improve my shooting and get more efficient,"" Curry said. ""Obviously a good start to that but got to sustain it and stick to the program of what I've been doing."" Kevin Durant added 24 points and eight assists, and Draymond Green contributed 16 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists for his first double-double of the season. Green has 50 assists in the last five games and is a big reason the Warriors are passing so well this season. They finished with a season-high 39 assists. ""Probably the best player on the floor tonight,"" Kerr said of Green. ""... We are only as good as Draymond is on many nights."" Anthony Davis returned from a two-game absence with a sprained right elbow and shot just 6 of 16 for 17 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for the Pelicans, who lost a five-game Western Conference semifinal to Golden State last postseason. ""I thought he was a little winded,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They weren't going to let him catch the ball and go one-on-one against anybody down there."" Klay Thompson scored 18 points with one 3-pointer for the Warriors two days after setting an NBA record with 14 3s and scoring 52 in a blowout road win against the Bulls. Curry scored 16 points in the third quarter with four 3s. He wound up 12 for 20 and 7 of 11 from deep. Two-time defending champion Golden State's lone loss came in the third game of the season by two points at Denver on Oct. 21. Jrue Holiday had 28 points and nine assists while Nikola Mirotic added 26 points and 12 rebounds for New Orleans, which has a quick turnaround playing at Portland on Thursday night. The Pelicans lost their third straight. The Warriors had 12 assists on 16 baskets with five 3-pointers in their 43-point first quarter. MOMENT OF SILENCE A moment of silence was held before the game for San Francisco Giants Hall of Famer Willie McCovey, who died Wednesday at age 80. ""For me, Willie McCovey represents a major figure from my childhood,"" said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who grew up a Dodgers fan. ""Hearing Vin Scully talking about Willie McCovey and the Dodger/Giant rivalry. I'm well aware of how beloved Willie was here in the Bay Area and by the Giants family. We extend our condolences to Willie's family and to the Giants family. Everybody here with the Warriors is thinking about them tonight."" LET'S GET TROPICAL! During his sharp-shooting barrage against Chicago, Thompson was forced to wear a large yellow headband over a cut on his forehead, and he joked after the game he looked like Jackie Moon, Will Ferrell's character from the movie ""Semi-Pro."" Thompson then arrived to the arena Wednesday dressed as Moon in a Flint Tropics jersey for Halloween. TIP-INS Pelicans: The Pelicans were outrebounded 46-42. ... Elfrid Payton missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... New Orleans lost each of its previous two games scoring 111 points, against Utah and Denver. ...

Warriors: Reserve G Shaun Livingston missed his third straight game with soreness in his right foot. The MRI was clear, coach Steve Kerr said, ""but we are going to be very careful with Shaun."" Kerr also plans to take every precaution with fellow veteran Andre Iguodala because ""we want both guys to be fresh and ready to roll for the playoffs."" ... Three Golden State starters had two fouls by early in the second quarter -- Curry, Green and Damian Jones. ... The Warriors played at home on Halloween for the first time since hosting Phoenix on Oct. 31, 2000.","401070789"
"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James walked into Staples Center on Halloween dressed as Jason from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. Five hours later, he saved the Los Angeles Lakers from a horrifying ending. The four-time MVP scored 29 points and made the game-winning free throw with 2.1 seconds left Wednesday night as the Lakers held on for a 114-113 win over the Dallas Mavericks. ""I don't like the way we closed out the game, but for the majority of the game we played well,"" James said. Los Angeles led nearly throughout and was up 111-98 with 3:42 to go before the Mavericks went on a 15-2 run to pull even. Luka Doncic tied it at 113 with 7.2 seconds remaining on a jumper from the corner, but on the next trip down the floor James was fouled by Wesley Mathews while shooting a jump shot. James missed the first free throw but made the second. J.J. Barea missed a 3-pointer for Dallas as time expired, and the Lakers (3-5) stopped a two-game skid. ""NBA games are never over and you have to play the game a certain way,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""If you mess with the game, the game will mess with you and I thought we did that a little bit. Hopefully we can learn the same lesson even if it was a win."" JaVale McGee added 16 points and 15 rebounds, Kyle Kuzma scored 18 and Brandon Ingram had 17 for the Lakers. Matthews led Dallas with 21 points and Harrison Barnes scored 19. The Mavericks (2-6) have lost five straight. ""I love the fight. Our first quarter was very disappointing but we battled back,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We were able to get stops in the fourth quarter and we were getting some momentum on offense."" The Lakers scored the first eight points and led by 18 in the first quarter as they went 15 of 23 from the field and made six 3-pointers. Dallas trimmed the margin to 66-59 by halftime. Matthews' driving bank shot pulled the Mavericks to 70-64 before the Lakers went on a 17-4 run -- which included 10 points by James -- to open their largest lead at 87-68 with 4:40 remaining in the third. The closest the Mavericks got in the first eight minutes of the fourth was 98-90 with 8:12 left. ROAD WOES The Mavericks, who dropped to 0-5 on the road, are one of seven teams in the NBA without a win away from home. They have lost 10 straight road games dating back to last season. TOUGH START, BETTER FINISH Doncic, the second pick in the 2018 draft, said before the game that he grew up idolizing James. The teenager from Slovenia, who scored 31 points Monday night at San Antonio and is averaging 20.4 points per game, might have been in awe a bit during his first game against James as he missed his first six shots. Doncic was able to shake off the slow start, though, as he made his final five shots from the field and finished with 14 points. James gave Doncic his jersey after the game. TALE OF TWO HALVES The Lakers held the Mavericks to 37 percent from the floor in the first and third quarters (17 of 46), but Dallas shot 65 percent (26 of 40) in the second and fourth. ""The first and third quarters defensively we were pretty good and then we had two awful quarters. It is just about getting better with those things,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Mavericks: DeAndre Jordan had 12 rebounds and 10 points. ... Barea (15 points) and Dwight Powell (12) came off the bench to score in double figures. ... The Mavericks were 14 of 19 from the field in the second quarter. ... G Devin Harris (left hamstring strain) missed his seventh straight game. Lakers: Have won three straight against the Mavericks. ...

The last Lakers player to accomplish that was Pau Gasol on Jan. 20, 2014, at Chicago. ... Kuzma scored 11 points in the first quarter. ... The 38 points were a season high for a first quarter. ... F Michael Beasley missed his second straight game due to personal reasons.","401070790"
"PHOENIX --  DeMar DeRozan and coach Gregg Popovich had a talk before Wednesday night's game about DeRozan's playing time this season. The hope was DeRozan could get a bit more rest. It worked out just right for DeRozan, Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs in their 120-90 win over the Phoenix Suns. DeRozan scored 20 of his 25 points in the first half, LaMarcus Aldridge added 24 points and the Spurs routed the Suns for their third straight victory. DeRozan and Aldridge, Nos. 1 and 2 in the NBA in minutes per game going in, sat out the entire fourth quarter with the Spurs comfortably ahead. ""That was big,"" said DeRozan, who was averaging 38.9 minutes per game. ""That was one thing that was on my mind today. To go out there and do what we're supposed to do so we'd be able to rest."" The Spurs led by 31 during the second quarter en route to a fifth straight win over Phoenix. Aldridge scored 16 points in the third. He and DeRozan combined to make 20 of 25 shots. ""It's always nice to get some rest,"" Aldridge said. ""I thought guys came in focused from the beginning. It's always nice when your shots go in. DeMar started out hot and I got it going in the third, and that always makes it easy for us."" The Suns have lost six straight and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers and Washington Wizards at 1-6, tied for the NBA's worst. T.J. Warren, in his first start of the season, led Phoenix with 21 points. Suns rookie Mikal Bridges added a career-best 16 points. ""The final score is basically saying a lot where we're at as a team,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. The Spurs closed out the first quarter on a 15-2 run after the game was tied at 13. San Antonio went up 40-22 on DeRozan's fastbreak dunk with 7:34 left in the first half. DeRozan made 8 of 10 shots in the first half, many on drives to the basket. The Spurs made 24 of 41 shots in the first half and turned the game into a blowout with the Suns struggling on the offensive end. San Antonio stayed hot, making 55.4 percent of its shots. Marco Belinelli's fadeaway 3-pointer with 2:12 left in the first half made the score 60-29. The Spurs led by 32 points during the fourth quarter. The Suns scored the final 10 points of the first half to trail by 21 at the break. ""We're going to come back and we're going to learn and watch some film and get better,"" Bridges said. ""Just playing as a team, going out there and just fighting."" TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio will be back in Phoenix in two weeks for the second meeting of the season between the two teams. ... DeRozan has led the Spurs in scoring in six of their seven games. ... F Rudy Gay came up hobbling after missing a layup late in the third quarter, but shook it off and remained in the game. Suns: Phoenix played its third straight game without star guard Devin Booker, who is still dealing with a hamstring strain. ... G Isaiah Canaan (left ankle strain) was held out. ... G Josh Jackson played despite a bruised left toe. ... The Suns are 8-10 on Halloween. EXCUSE ME Aldridge inadvertently tipped up a pass from DeRozan, and the ball dropped into the net for two points with 8:56 left in the third quarter. The two shared a smile as they headed back on defense. YOUNG SUNS RUNNING POINT With Canaan out, the Suns began the game with rookie Elie Okobo at point guard making his first career start. Backing him up was another rookie, De'Anthony Melton, who had been inactive for the past three games. Melton played a season high 20 minutes.","401070791"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  James Borrego wasn't upset Russell Westbrook put up 29 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds against his team Thursday night. He expected that from the seven-time All-Star. What bothered Charlotte's first-year coach is that Alex Abrines had 25 points on five 3-pointers and Dennis Schroder was able to get to the rim effectively and add 21 more, helping the Oklahoma Thunder overcame a 19-point deficit to beat Borrego's Hornets 111-107 for their third straight win. Borrego called it ""game plan errors."" Paul George had a different explanation: that's just the way Westbrook impacts games. He called the seven-time All-Star ""one of the baddest dudes in the league."" Abrines deflected praise for his big game to Westbrook, saying all he had to do was make open shots. ""The defense has two options -- come in and help and leave me open or stay attached to me and (Westbrook) is going to get layups,"" Abrines said. ""Sometimes you just stay in the corner and wait for the pass to come."" ""Alex has to be ready to shoot the ball, he's a shooter and he knows how to play the game of basketball,"" Westbrook said. Westbrook did his part, hurting the Hornets in transition, with pull-up jumpers and in pick and rolls, a few of which resulted in highlight reel dunks. He also helped limit Kemba Walker to 21 points. The Thunder made a concerted effort to slow down Walker, who came in averaging 30 points per game. Walker failed to make a field goal before the break and had just three points, although the Hornets still led 48-44 at halftime. Walker came to life in the third with 10 straight points to help the Hornets push their lead to 19. Westbrook led the Thunder back. With 1:12 left, he drove and found an open Dennis Schroder with a crosscourt pass for an open 3-pointer. After a Charlotte miss, Westbrook used a screen from Steven Adams to get by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for a layup to push the lead to 108-102. Westbrook punctuated the win with a ferocious dunk with 13 seconds left off a fast break before stopping to glare at the crowd. TIP INS Thunder: Were 8 of 37 from 3-point range. Hornets: Charlotte entered with 104 3-pointers, tied for the second most ever through eight games behind last season's Golden State Warriors (107). ... Marvin Williams now has 500 career blocks. ... Tony Parker went down hard on his left elbow but remained in the game. Borrego said he is fine. GEORGE'S DEAD FOOT George had a rough night, shooting 4 of 20 from the field and finishing with 11 points. After the game, George revealed he's been dealing with a peroneal nerve palsy or ""dead foot."" ""I am just trying to play through that,"" George said. ""It's nothing major or that is going to hurt me. It's just something that is going to come back when it feels right."" STRATEGY ON WALKER Thunder coach Billy Donovan joked he wasn't giving away his strategy for slowing down Walker in the first half since they have to play the Hornets again. ""It was a collective team effort and we did a really good job,"" Donovan said. ""You have to do a good job in pick and roll coverage and you have to be persistent because he's really shifty. He looks like he is giving up on the play and you bail out and there he goes."" Said Walker: ""They were blitzing me the whole game, so I kind of got a few of my baskets early in the third in transition. But yeah everyone is switching now, but for the most part in the pick and roll they were blitzing me."" WESTBROOK'S TECH Westbrook got a technical foul early for screaming ""and one"" after a driving layup after the foul wasn't called. He appeared not to like the call very much because on the next possession he split two Charlotte defenders and threw down a dunk.","401070792"
"CLEVELAND --  The Denver Nuggets aren't getting too excited about their early season success. Denver moved to 7-1 with a 110-91 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, the Nuggets' best start since going 8-0 in 1976-77. The Nuggets are keeping their feet on the ground despite having the second-most wins in the NBA. ""I love the 7-1 start, but it doesn't mean a lot to me, to be honest,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""For us, the only real success will be measured in the postseason."" Juancho Hernangomez scored 23 points and Paul Millsap added 16 to lead six players in double figures. The Nuggets won their third straight. On Wednesday night in Chicago, they beat the Bulls 108-107 in overtime on Millsap's put-back with 0.1 seconds left. Millsap, in his 13th season, is not only being productive, but he's also a veteran voice in the locker room. ""We can't be content,"" he said. ""We can't be complacent. We just want to stay in the moment."" Jordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 17 points, and Cedi Osman added 13. Collin Sexton, the No. 8 overall pick, had 12 points. The Cavaliers dropped to 1-7. They have split two games under ""acting"" coach Larry Drew. Denver shot 6 for 17 in the first quarter and fell behind 29-17. After cutting it to 38-34, the Nuggets finished the second period on 16-4 run that included 13 straight points. Millsap had a simple explanation for the first quarter. ""At the start, we were shaking off some of the rust, I guess,"" he said. Asked what happened on Cleveland's end, Drew chuckled and said, ""That's a good question. We made bad decisions, we turned the basketball over, we couldn't make shots and our defense let us down."" Hernangomez had 12 points in the quarter, including three 3-pointers. The backup forward came into the game with 22 points for the season and didn't get off the bench Wednesday. ""Juancho was the best player on the floor for long stretches,"" Malone said. ""You've got to give a lot of credit to him."" Denver led 50-42 at halftime and dominated the second half. The Nuggets' biggest lead was 26 points at 106-76. The Nuggets won going away despite an off-night from leading scorer Nikola Jokic, who had averaged 21.6 points. The 7-footer scored four points in 22 minutes and didn't play in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers had another busy day off the court. Drew said contract negotiations with the team are going in a positive direction. Drew replaced Tyronn Lue, who was fired Sunday, but wants the Cavs to restructure his contract if he's going to become the team's interim coach. Guard J.R. Smith said he wants to be traded after being dropped from the rotation. The 15-year veteran has played in four of Cleveland's eight games. A few fans began a ""We want J.R."" chant as Denver built the lead in the second half. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced Thursday that the Cavaliers have been awarded the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. The game will be a cornerstone event during the league's 75th anniversary. IT'S NOT EASY The Cavaliers knew the transition without LeBron James would be difficult when he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers after leading Cleveland to four straight Finals and a championship in 2016. Forward Kevin Love is out indefinitely with a left foot injury, making matters more complicated. ""With LeBron leaving we take on a whole new identity,"" Drew said. ""We have no Kevin Love. We're trying to find out ways to score. We're trying to find out ways to play without Kevin and we have to find it out really quick."" STILL AILING Nuggets G Isaiah Thomas has yet to appear in a game after undergoing hip surgery in March. Cleveland acquired Thomas from Boston for All-Star G Kyrie Irving prior to last season, but he didn't play until January because of the hip injury. Thomas played in only 15 games with the Cavaliers before being dealt to the Lakers. He signed with the Nuggets in July.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid wants to be the NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year this season. He is off to a solid start. Embiid had 41 points and 13 rebounds, helping the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 122-113 on Thursday night. It was Embiid's sixth game already this season with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. Philadelphia fans rained down ""MVP! MVP!"" chants on the big man. ""It's great,"" Embiid said. ""It's just about being aggressive and staying within the concepts of the system."" Ben Simmons added 14 points and 11 assists, bouncing back nicely from one of his worst games as a pro. Markelle Fultz provided a spark late in the third quarter and finished with 12 points, nine rebounds and five assists while helping Philadelphia improve to 5-0 at home. But it was Embiid leading the way for the Sixers. ""He's tough, he's skilled, he can shoot, he basically can do everything,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Philadelphia led by as many as 11 in the final quarter on Embiid's follow dunk, but the advantage was just three with 6:16 remaining. Embiid then scored nine of the next 12 points, including an emphatic dunk over Boban Marjanovic with 1:39 remaining that gave Philadelphia a 117-109 lead. ""He was just dominant,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Lou Williams scored 26 points for the Clippers, and Danilo Gallinari had 25. Tobias Harris finished with 24 points. ""We didn't execute (down the stretch) and had bad shot selection,"" Rivers said. ""That can't happen."" The Clippers trailed by as many as 22 points in the opening half and were down 72-57 entering the third quarter. But Los Angeles slowly chipped away at the deficit, going in front for the first time on Gallinari's 3-pointer from the right wing that made it 81-80 with 3:58 left in the period. Another Gallinari 3 put the Clippers up 84-80 before Fultz showed flashes of why Philadelphia drafted him first overall in 2017. Fultz scored on a goaltending call, and then assisted on Mike Muscala's four-point play before converting consecutive coast-to-coast layups, helping the 76ers end the quarter on a 10-2 run that put them ahead 90-86 entering the fourth. ""He had a huge influence,"" Rivers said. ""He might have been the change of the game."" Said Brown: ""We continue to see why he was drafted (No. 1). He's really gifted with the ball as a point guard."" BETTER BEN After tying his career high with 11 turnovers in Tuesday's 119-112 loss at Toronto, Simmons had just two turnovers against Los Angeles.

"ATLANTA --  De'Aaron Fox's teammates made sure he knew he was close to his first career triple-double. Fox reached the milestone in a rout inspired by a similarly lopsided loss in Sacramento's last visit to Atlanta. Fox set career highs with 31 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Kings beat the Hawks 146-115 on Thursday night for their fifth straight win. Fox didn't have to look at the scoreboard to know he was approaching the triple-double. ""They told me,"" Fox said of his teammates. ""It was like, `Go get it."" Fox's 10th rebound completed the memorable achievement. The second-year guard's previous career highs were 16 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. The Hawks had no answer for Fox's quickness and shooting. He went 3 for 4 from 3-point range. ""Fox is one of the, if not the, fastest guys in the league,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""He's got a different motor. He sets the pace for them at all times. When he's hitting 3s, he's hard to stop."" Fox and the Kings did not forget an ugly 126-80 loss at Atlanta on Nov. 15, 2017, that was the Hawks' most lopsided win in franchise history. ""This was a game that maybe meant a little more,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Even so, Joerger said he wasn't expecting to win by 31 points. ""Nobody saw this coming,"" he said. Last season's Kings-Hawks game was a matchup of last-place teams. The Kings showed the Hawks the difference one season can make. ""They went through struggles last year and you see what they're able to do now,"" Hawks rookie point guard Trae Young said. ""Of course, you never want to lose like this."" Buddy Hield scored 27 points and Nemanja Bjelica had 19 for the Kings (6-3), whose winning streak includes four straight against Eastern Conference teams, including the last three on the road. The Kings averaged 110.8 points over the first four games of the streak. They moved past that number with a full period remaining, carrying a 115-87 lead into the final quarter. After leading by only five points at halftime, the Kings outscored the Hawks 46-23 in the third. Fox had 21 points in the period. Sacramento maintained its up-tempo pressure in the final period.

The Hawks made 60.5 percent of their first-half shots (23 of 38), easily a season-best performance. They finished at 48.3 percent. SLOW START Young recovered from a slow start to post a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists. He had four turnovers with two points in the first period and finished with eight of the Hawks' 22 turnovers. HUERTER HURT Pierce said there was no word on the severity of the sprained right ankle for guard Kevin Huerter, who left with 4:27 remaining in the first period. The rookie limped off the court after Hield crashed into the back of his leg while diving for a loose ball.","401070795"
"Gordon Hayward describes a play in the first half against the Bucks, when he landed on his left foot and was sore afterward. (0:46) BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics went outside and stayed there while knocking off the last of the NBA's unbeatens with a barrage of 3-pointers. The Celtics set a franchise record for 3-pointers with 24 in a 117-113 win over the Bucks on Thursday night, handing Milwaukee its first loss of the season. ""We got a lot of open looks. We were taking what they were giving us,"" said Gordon Hayward, who hit three 3-pointers while scoring a season-high 18. ""Those are big shots for us. We have to be able to hit those."" Kyrie Irving led Boston with 28 points, including six 3-pointers as the Celtics shattered the club record of 19 and came up one short of the NBA record. Al Horford also scored 18, hitting four from beyond-the-arc, and Marcus Morris made five 3-pointers to finish with 17 points. ""It was probably a little more than we wanted to shoot, but those were the shots that were there,"" said Horford, who also led the Celtics with eight assists. ""We definitely want to be better, but we did a good job. I just felt like we moved the ball well. That was encouraging to see."" Giannis Antetokounmpo returned to the lineup after missing one game while in the NBA's concussion protocol and led Milwaukee with 33 points and 11 rebounds. Antetokounmpo helped lead the Bucks to a 62-22 advantage in points-in-the-paint, but it wasn't quite enough for Milwaukee to overcome Boston's outside shooting. ""We were all shooting really well,"" Morris said. ""We were just knocking them down and our guys got hot."" Milwaukee, the last unbeaten team left in the NBA after beating Toronto on Monday night, came up just short after a furious rally in the fourth quarter. Down 15 entering the final period, the Bucks opened on a 12-0 run and were within a point in the final minute, but the Celtics held on for their fourth straight win. ""We still think we are one of the best teams,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Tonight we didn't have an `A' or `B' game. Probably a `C' game, but we were still close to winning the game in Boston."" Khris Middleton and Malcom Brogdon scored 16 apiece and Eric Bledsoe had 13 points and seven assists for the Bucks. The Celtics, whose previous record for 3-pointers was 19, came one short of tying the NBA record of 25, set by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a win over the Atlanta Hawks on March 4. Boston didn't score in the fourth until Jayson Tatum hit a 3-pointer with 9:13 left in the game. Milwaukee continued to push and pulled within 113-112 when Bledsoe made 1 of 2 from the foul line with 13 seconds. That was as close as the Bucks would get as the Celtics sealed it from the foul line. Irving hit back-to-back 3-pointers late in the second quarter and Boston led 55-53 at halftime. He opened the second half with three straight from beyond-the-arc and the Celtics appeared to be cruising with a 93-78 lead entering the fourth quarter. ""We can get better. We can play better, but credit to Boston tonight,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. COMING ALONG Hayward's previous season-high was 15. Thursday was actually his highest-scoring game as a member of the Celtics, missing last season after a gruesome ankle injury in the opening game. Hayward had a scare in the first half when he came down hard on the left ankle, but was able to finish. ""I think I got off to a good start and that was important for me. It felt good being able to be out there at the end of the game, too,"" Hayward said. ""It's an ongoing process. Last game wasn't that great. Tonight was a little bit better."" ALL HAIL! There was an extended time out midway through the first quarter, when Red Sox manager Alex Cora carried the World Series championship trophy onto the court, followed by his players. Fans roared when Cora led the team out of the tunnel and got louder each time a player hoisted the trophy high for the fans to continue a celebration that started Sunday with a series-clinching victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. To punctuate the visit, fans broke out in a round of their favorite derogatory chant about the rival New York Yankees. TIP INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo returned to practice Wednesday and was cleared to play Thursday. He was injured Saturday by a blow to the head during in a game against Orlando. Antetokounmpo said it was his first concussion. Celtics: Boston's previous franchise record for 3-pointers was 19, done twice, most recently Jan. 16 in a win over New Orleans. . G Jaylen Brown was out with a sore right foot. . Semi Ojeleye, who played all of 24 minutes and scored two points through the first seven games, started for Brown and scored 10 points.","401070796"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  While the Trail Blazers found it easy to score against the Pelicans, in the end it was their defense -- and some stops in the fourth quarter -- that helped Portland pull away. Damian Lillard scored 26 points to help Portland beat New Orleans 132-119 on Thursday night in the first meeting between the teams since the Pelicans swept the Trail Blazers in the first round of last season's playoffs. Jusuf Nurkic added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Blazers, who made 18 3-pointers in their third straight win. New Orleans, hurt by the absence of star Anthony Davis, dropped its fourth consecutive game. The Pelicans were the sixth seed last season when they upset the third-seeded Blazers in the playoffs. ""Tonight we came out and it was easy on offense, so it seemed like we kind of just fell into that trap, where we're going to be able to score and hoping they miss instead of going out there and making them miss, and taking the challenge. And seeing that Anthony Davis wasn't out there, you take those situations for granted. And they made us pay for it early,"" Lillard said. ""I think we showed our maturity and growth in how we rebounded and adjusted and made the changes we needed to make."" Julius Randle scored 29 points, but Pelicans star Davis was sidelined by a right elbow sprain. Davis had returned from the injury Wednesday night against Golden State, when he collected 17 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in a 131-121 loss to the Warriors. Davis leads New Orleans with 25.2 points and 13 rebounds per game. He was replaced in the starting lineup against the Blazers by Jahlil Okafor. The Blazers were home after a 3-1 trip that included victories at Orlando, Indiana and Houston. Portland was without Maurice Harkless because of a lingering left knee injury. Harkless has played in five of the Blazers' eight games this season. Lillard had 10 points in the first quarter and the Blazers led 35-31. The Pelicans were paced by Randle, who had 23 points in the first half before he collected three fouls and went back to the bench. Seth Curry's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 51-44 advantage. E'Twaun Moore's 3-pointer got the Pelicans within three late in the half, but the Blazers led 70-65 at the break. Moore's floater got the Pelicans as close as 65-64 in the third quarter but Portland held New Orleans off until Randle's jumper and Nikola Mirotic's free throw tied it at 90. Portland hit consecutive 3-pointers to end the threat. The Blazers outscored the Pelicans 30-20 in the final quarter. ""The first three quarter of the game we gave ourselves a chance, then the fourth quarter we didn't score as well and we didn't get the stops when we needed them,"" Randle said. Al-Farouq Aminu had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Portland in his third double-double this season. The Blazers' reserves scored 50 points. Mirotic finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds for New Orleans, and Jrue Holiday also had a double-double with 17 points and 10 assists. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis warmed up with his teammates before the game. ... In his pregame talk with reporters, Alvin Gentry shot down reports of a confrontation the night before with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis. ""It couldn't be further from the truth,"" Gentry said, characterizing the conversation as friendly. Trail Blazers: Terry Stotts was coaching his 500th game for the Blazers. ... Portland's franchise high for 3-pointers is 21. ... Portland's point total was a season high. ... The Blazers scored 30-plus points in every quarter. ABOUT THOSE THREES: The Pelicans had eight 3-pointers compared to Portland's 18. ""We've gotta get guys off the line, you know? The point differential is 30 points from the 3-point line,"" Gentry said. ""I mean, we dominate in the paint, we shoot more free throws, but it's really, really difficult to make up a 30-point deficit from three. So we've got to get them off the line and make a few more of our own.""","401070797"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Things were going so well for Los Angeles Clippers guard Lou Williams on Friday night that even when one of his shots missed, he ended up getting credit for a basket. Williams scored 23 of his game-high 28 points in the second half in leading the Clippers to a 120-95 rout of the Orlando Magic. It was the Clippers' 10th straight win over the Magic. Williams hit all five 3-point attempts in the second half, including one that clearly bounced far off the rim. But he got credit anyway when referee Sean Corbin called goaltending on Magic rookie Mo Bamba. ""Lou got it going in the third and fourth quarter and that changed the game,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He is just an amazing, amazing shooter and he shoots from all angles. It used to be he could only go left and now he goes right. He is a professional scorer and you see it every time he plays."" Tobias Harris had 21 points and Danilo Gallinari 13 for Los Angeles, which led by 15 going into the fourth period and quickly pushed it to 25 after Williams hit three straight 3s to make it 106-81 with 6:57 left. Boban Marjanovic made his first start for the Clippers and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 19 and D.J. Augustin had 13 points for the Magic, who have lost four straight. Orlando cut an 18-point deficit to nine on three occasions in the third quarter, but never could sustain a rally. Fournier's driving layup made it 79-70 with 1:35 left in the quarter, but Milos Teodosic and Williams hit back-to-back 3-pointers and the Clippers took an 87-72 lead into the final period. ""Difficult, difficult night,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Effort level, body language, purpose of play . that was not even close to being acceptable, not for a professional basketball team. This is really disappointing."" ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT The Magic are coming off six straight losing seasons and appear headed in that direction after a 2-6 start this year. Clifford says his team needs to start its rebound with a change of attitude. ""We have the wrong, wrong attitude,"" Clifford said after his team was routed by the Clippers. ""There have been some tough times here and we have some guys who have been through that, but we have to have great attitude, great fight and great readiness and we had none of that tonight. Maybe this is going to be harder to do than I thought."" GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION The Los Angeles Clippers invited Magic rookie Mo Bamba in for a workout before last summer's NBA Draft and he made quite an impression on coach Doc Rivers. Bamba brought a CD of himself that contained highlights of his best offensive moves to show how far his game had progressed. ""He wanted us to see all that and it was impressive,"" Rivers said. ""Steve Ballmer (Clippers owner) was in the room and I think it was the most impressive interview we ever had in the times I've done it. He's long, he already has great touch, he shoots the ball pretty well. He's going to be a good player."" The Magic grabbed Bamba with the sixth pick in the first round. The Clippers picked 11th and selected point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. TIP-INS Clippers: C Marcin Gortat had 186 straight starts in his NBA career, including the first eight games this season, before taking a DNP-CD against Orlando. ... Montrezl Harrell had a double-double, 10 points, 12 rebounds, off the bench. Magic: PF Jonathan Isaac left the game in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle. He did not return. ... Orlando shot a team-record 43 3-point attempts in each of its last two games, but took only 17 against the Clippers. ... Orlando is 0-6 this season when trailing at halftime.","401070798"
"NEW YORK --  The Rockets had talked long enough about their struggles, and then it was time to do something about it. So during a timeout with the Brooklyn Nets carving up their defense early Friday night, the Rockets decided they didn't need to hear any more from their coaches. The only way they could solve things was by themselves. ""We just said, you all stay out for a second. Let us talk,"" Chris Paul said. ""At some point, enough is enough."" Paul had 32 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds, Carmelo Anthony added a season-high 28 points and Houston snapped a four-game losing streak with a 119-111 victory. Clint Capela finished with 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Eric Gordon contributed 21 points for the Rockets, who had stumbled to a 1-5 start a season after winning 65 games and falling a game short of the NBA Finals. ""We had to watch it, we had to look at it and we had to kind of just hold ourselves accountable to what's going on out there,"" Anthony said. ""Look our own selves in the mirror as individuals, as a team, figure out what we wanted to do and tonight we did that."" They did thanks to one of the best games as a Rocket for Paul, who had season bests in points and assists in the final game before his workload should ease Saturday with the expected return of James Harden. The league MVP missed his third straight game with a strained left hamstring and coach Mike D'Antoni said he would probably return for the second half of a back-to-back in Chicago. Anthony bounced back from a 2-for-12, eight-point performance against Portland by coming off the bench to hit six 3-pointers. Caris LeVert scored 29 points for the Nets, who got off to a sizzling start before the Rockets turned around the game. One of the NBA's most potent offenses had been held below 90 points in two of the previous three games after doing so only three times all last season. The offense was back Friday, but the defense took a while to get going. Brooklyn made 14 of its first 18 shots, including 13 of 14 inside the 3-point arc while simply driving by defenders. The Nets finished 15 of 21 in the opening quarter, taking a 32-25 lead. Paul kept the Rockets close with 13 points in the second, including a deep 3-pointer that cut it to 61-56 at halftime The Rockets then surged ahead with an 11-0 run in the third, with Anthony making two 3-pointers, a jumper and blocking a shot as Houston went ahead 76-69. Anthony hit two more 3s in the fourth. ""Third quarter was where they got their break,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We've had some issues there before and felt like they came out more aggressive and thought we missed some shots. They picked up their defense. I felt that."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston avoided matching its longest skid of last season. The Rockets dropped five in a row from Dec. 20-29. ... Paul's highest-scoring game with the Rockets is 37 points last Jan. 10 against Portland. Nets: Atkinson said there was no decision yet if rookies Rodions Kurucs and Dzanan Musa would play for Long Island on Saturday in its season opener. Both players worked out with the G League affiliate this week. ... The Nets scored 26 of their 32 first-quarter points in the paint, marking their most points in the paint in a quarter since having 26 in the first on Dec. 7, 2016, against Denver. HARDEN'S HOPES Harden has worked out without discomfort and D'Antoni said he likely would have returned Friday if the Rockets had been off following the game. But because they were playing on two straight nights and he wouldn't use Harden on both of them after returning from injury, D'Antoni is opting to wait the extra day and bring Harden back Saturday at Chicago. The league MVP was hurt near the end of a loss to Utah on Oct. 24 and Houston had been routed in both games since. ALL FOULED UP D'Antoni said before the game there was no explanation for Houston's offensive troubles, saying the Rockets were getting the same shots as last season, just shooting them 20 percent worse. ""Foul shots not going in. You don't change up a foul shot. We're not even making those,"" D'Antoni said. ""So we've obviously got some kind of malaise over us that we've got to shrug off and get going."" The Rockets entered shooting 70.2 percent at the line, 27th in the NBA, after finishing ninth last season at 78.1 percent.","401070799"
"WASHINGTON --  Russell Westbrook's Oklahoma City Thunder and John Wall's Washington Wizards both got off to poor starts to the season. Westbrook and Co. turned things around quickly. Wall's Wizards have not. The Thunder have gone from 0-4 to 4-4, picking up their fourth consecutive victory by beating the struggling, booed-at-home Wizards 134-111 behind Westbrook's 23 points and 12 assists Friday night. The outcome was decided in the second quarter, when OKC outscored Washington 44-20, a lopsided result Wizards coach Scott Brooks called ""ridiculous."" ""We just pride ourselves on defense, starting with myself and going down the line. That's our objective -- especially in my mind -- is to be the best defensive team in the league, just disrupt the game,"" said Westbrook, who sat out the final period. ""That's the biggest key for us every night. I'm going to continue to pride myself on that starting with myself: Defend at a high level and go on down the line."" The Wizards wish they could play well at that end of the court. Even though OKC was the team playing on the second night of a back-to-back, it looked a lot fresher and more active than Washington, which was coming off a two-day break and finally got to see new center Dwight Howard make his debut. After missing all of training camp, every exhibition game and the first seven regular-season games with a sore backside, Howard started and immediately appeared to have an impact, scoring 13 first-quarter points. But soon enough, Washington got into its usual bad habits, the ones that have led to loss after loss so far: ineffective defense and low-effort rebounding. ""They got layups after layups, wide-open 3s,"" Wall said. ""They did whatever they wanted."" The Wizards have lost five games in a row to drop to 1-7, and spectators let the players hear their displeasure in the second quarter, jeering when OKC went ahead 61-40 on Jerami Grant's dunk on a pass from Westbrook. When Paul George made his third straight 3 attempt, a night after going 0 for 10 from beyond the arc, it made the halftime score 79-50, equaling the Thunder's record for most points in a half. An Oklahoma City team averaging 109 points this season was already at 110 after three quarters. George wound up with 17 points to surpass 10,000 for his career, and Grant scored 22. Howard had 20 points on 7-of-8 shooting, three rebounds and four fouls in 23 minutes. When he was out of the game, he either laid down on his stomach on the sideline or stood. Bradley Beal scored 27 points, and Wall had 19 points and nine assists, but Washington's pair of All-Star guards also combined for 12 turnovers. The Thunder went up by as many as 33 points in the third quarter and shot 57 percent for the game. They outrebounded the Wizards 38-30. None of that should come as a surprise, given that Washington began the night allowing an NBA-worst 122.4 points per game and averaging only 41.3 rebounds, 27th in the 30-club league. ""I refuse,"" Beal said, ""to let the ship sink."" TIP-INS Thunder: Came in shooting 27 percent on 3s, but hit 47 percent -- 15 for 32 -- against Washington. ... George has complained of a nerve issue with his left foot, and coach Billy Donovan said George thinks it affects his defense. ""There's times where he wishes he could push off a little bit better and move a little bit better -- more to the extreme that he's capable of doing,"" Donovan said. ""I think he still feels he's hindered by it."" Wizards: Otto Porter Jr. played with a bruised big left toe and scored nine points in only 16 minutes. ... Brooks on Ian Mahinmi, who started at center while Howard was sidelined but now returns to a backup role: ""His minutes are going to shrink quite a bit, but he has to be ready whenever he's called on.""","401070800"
"CHICAGO --  Whenever the Indiana Pacers needed a big play, Victor Oladipo delivered. It was an all-too-familiar finish for the Chicago Bulls. Oladipo had 25 points and 14 rebounds, Darren Collison made a tiebreaking jumper down the stretch, and the Pacers topped the Bulls 107-105 on Friday night. ""The great thing about this team is we respond well,"" Oladipo said. ""We get on each other. We get upset at each other. We challenge each other, but at the end of the day, we're still a family."" Myles Turner added 18 points and Collison finished with 14 as Indiana earned its fifth consecutive road win for its longest such streak since April 2012. Turner also matched a career high with six blocked shots, including Antonio Blakeney's desperate jumper as the final seconds ticked off. The Pacers trailed by as many as 18 early in the second quarter. ""We stayed with it,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""We started to get some stops. Second unit came in and got us back into the game, and the second half, we had to fight and score, and get stops."" Indiana appeared to be in solid shape with a 95-91 lead with 30.5 seconds left. But Blakeney converted a four-point play after he was fouled by Collison on a 3-point try from the top of the key. ""I'm just shooting with confidence,"" said Blakeney, who finished with a career-high 22 points. ""I've been working hard."" Collison then made up for the mistake with a pullup jumper with about 18 seconds remaining, putting Indiana back in front. The veteran guard was 6 for 15 from the field. Chicago then had three chances on its final possession and came up empty. Zach LaVine missed a fadeaway jumper and Justin Holiday was off on an open 3-pointer before Blakeney was blocked by Turner. ""Of course I thought it was going down,"" Holiday said. ""I couldn't believe the ball bounced to me. I was like, oh yeah, it's over. But some fall, some don't."" It was the second straight heartbreaking result for Chicago, which lost 108-107 to Denver in overtime on Wednesday night. The Bulls are winless on a four-game homestand heading into the finale Saturday night against Houston. ""I mean it's a good thing we're in these situations,"" Holiday said. ""Obviously we would rather be up and not be in them, but we're going to need this down the road to be able to win games."" LaVine scored nine of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, and Holiday finished with 19 points. Jabari Parker and rookie Wendell Carter Jr. each had 11 points. THERE HE IS Veteran center Robin Lopez checked in for the Bulls with 3:54 left in the first half for his first action since Oct. 22 at Dallas. Lopez was listed as a Did Not Play-Coach's Decision for Chicago's previous five games. Lopez finished with two rebounds, two blocked shots and an assist in almost four minutes against Indiana. TIP-INS Pacers: It was Oladipo's first double-double of the season. ... Thaddeus Young grabbed nine rebounds, giving him 1,005 with the Pacers. ... Indiana shot 47.1 percent (40 for 85) from the field. It was shooting 50.6 percent from the floor coming into the night, second in the NBA.

""He really just did straight ahead running today and he did spot shooting,"" Hoiberg said. There is no timetable yet for his return. ...

"DALLAS --  Allonzo Trier's two-way contract with New York is looking more and more like a one-way deal. As in, the rookie guard isn't leaving the Knicks anytime soon. Trier scored 19 of his career-high 23 points during a second-half surge, fellow rookie Mitchell Robinson had his first double-double and the Knicks beat Dallas 118-106 Friday night, handing the Mavericks their sixth straight loss. ""I've been here, what is this, 10 games now?"" Trier asked, overshooting the number by one after missing just two shots (8 of 10). ""It's been a lot of fun and I'm learning more each and every day, and we're learning more about everybody on this team and how to use everybody, not just me."" Tim Hardaway Jr. had 18 points and six rebounds to help the Knicks win for the second time in three games after a five-game skid that followed a victory in their opener. Robinson set career highs with 13 points and 10 rebounds. New York outscored Dallas 33-18 in the third quarter after trailing by three at halftime, and led by as many as 17 in the fourth, when Trier scored 14 . Dennis Smith Jr. scored 23 points and 19-year-old rookie Luka Doncic had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Mavericks, who matched their longest losing streak from the lost 2017-18 season. That six-game skid a year ago led to a 2-14 start and 24-58 finish, and this slump followed a 2-1 start that marked Dallas' first winning record since the end of the 2015-16 season. The Mavericks opened 2-13 two seasons ago. ""At this point, we've got to get angry,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We've got to get more together. We've got to have two great practice days. That's where we are."" The Knicks shot just 24 percent from 3-point territory against the worst defending team from long range, but they made up for it inside the arc. New York shot 71 percent (39 of 55) on 2-pointers and was at 55 percent overall for the game. Lance Thomas scored nine of his 10 points when the Knicks took control in the third and assisted during the surge on Robinson's reverse alley-oop dunk . ""I was high in the air, so why not just go ahead and do something?"" asked Robinson, the former Louisiana high school standout whose previous rebounding high was six. Dorian Finney-Smith had 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting for the Mavericks, but Harrison Barnes was held to 1 of 7 from 3-point range while scoring 14 points. DeAndre Jordan had a season-low four points and matched his lowest rebounding total this season with 10. TIP-INS Knicks: Damyean Dotson just missed his second double-double of the season, finishing with 11 points and eight rebounds. ... Others among the seven double-figure scorers were Enes Kanter (13 points) and Mario Hezonja (11). Mavericks: G Devin Harris was out again with a left hamstring strain. He hasn't played since the opener. ... J.J. Barea matched his season low with two points, attempting just five shots. He equaled Doncic with six assists. MITCHELL'S MODEL Robinson's best game so far came against Jordan, the 6-foot-11 center who extended his Dallas record with his ninth straight double-digit rebound game to start a season. Robinson matched Jordan on the boards and was much more of a factor offensively, going 5 of 6 from the field. ""I think DeAndre is a guy that Mitchell looks up to, and really respects,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Obviously there are a lot of similarities there that we're going to be using DeAndre as a model for Mitchell."" DEFENSE FIRST Another versatile game from Doncic, who has been Dallas' best player in his first two-plus weeks, prompted questions for Carlisle over whether the rookie should have a more prominent role in the offense. Carlisle was thinking about the sixth game out of nine in which the Mavericks have allowed at least 50 percent shooting. ""I'm so much more focused on the defense that the questions about the offense, to me, are insignificant,"" the coach said. ""It's become too commonplace. That's not going to get it, and I know we can do better.""","401070802"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Mike Conley is finally starting to feel like himself again. Conley, who missed most of last season with a heel injury and just began practicing full speed in September, scored a season-high 28 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies over the short-handed Utah Jazz 110-100 on Friday night. ""Some timing is still off a bit with the shot and the legs and getting the body back together, but tonight's game as opposed to the first time we played them is night and day,"" Conley said. Aiding his return has been the steady presence of teammate Marc Gasol. ""We've played together so much and we just play the game the right way,"" Conley said. ""It's easy to come back when you have a guy like that who knows where you need the ball and gets the best opportunity for your team to score."" Conley and Gasol, who had 17 points, orchestrated a motion offense with deft passing that kept the Jazz guessing and out of position as the Grizzlies shot 51 percent to win their third straight game. ""Once you make shots, everything gets easier. But we played unselfish, exploiting that pick-and-roll and mixing rolls with pops,"" said Gasol, who added 10 rebounds and seven assists, often initiating from the high post. Utah played without star guard Donovan Mitchell, the team's leading scorer. He sat out with a right hamstring strain. The Jazz missed their creative star on offense, and Conley said: ""It definitely helped that Donovan didn't play."" But the team pinned this loss on failing to stop the Grizzlies. ""Our group has to stake its claim on the defensive end,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""No matter who's out there, that's something that we can control. ... The defensive end is where we have to put our focus."" Ricky Rubio paced the Jazz with 22 points, and Jae Crowder scored 12 of his 18 in the fourth quarter. But he couldn't draw Utah closer than seven after Memphis' big run at the beginning of the period. ""I found my shot. I knew Donovan was out, so I had to be a little more aggressive in looking for my shot. It worked in the beginning,"" Rubio said. The Jazz led by 12 in the first half but the Grizzlies used a 30-18 third quarter to move in front. Joe Ingles, who had 19 points and became the seventh Jazz player with 500 3-pointers, sank a 3 on Utah's first possession of the fourth to get within two. But the Grizzlies scored 11 consecutive points, including back-to-back 3s by Gasol and MarShon Brooks. Shelvin Mack, who played for Utah from 2015-17, had 19 points -- the most he's scored since he was with the Jazz. ""When the shots are there I've got to take them,"" Mack said. ""Mike's able to drive and make plays for me."" Utah has dropped all three home games this season, including a 92-84 loss to Memphis just 10 days ago. The last time the Jazz started 0-3 at home was Ty Corbin's final season as coach in 2013-14. DRAWING RUDY FROM THE RIM Several times, the Grizzlies forced Utah's switching defense into uncomfortable matchups. ""We did a good job of taking advantage of their switches,"" Conley said. ""They're a very long team, especially with Rudy Gobert down there. When we got him out there guarding a guard, we got penetration and kick-out and that opened up the paint."" THE TWO-MAN GAME Gasol said it took all of ""22 seconds"" to feel comfortable with Conley in their first pickup game together this fall. ""We read basketball the same way. He sees the same angles that I see. Once we look at each other, we know what each other should do,"" Gasol said.

"PHOENIX --  The Toronto Raptors weren't at their best, but good enough to pull away from the Phoenix Suns for another victory in the best start to a season in the Canadian franchise's history. Kawhi Leonard scored 19 points and the Raptors used a 14-2 fourth-quarter run to finally put away the pesky Phoenix Suns 107-98 on Friday night. Jonas Valanciunas added 16 points and Serge Ibaka 14 for the Raptors, who improved to 8-1, the best nine-game start in franchise history. Kyle Lowry had 11 points and 12 assists. ""It is a 48 minute game and I think we are playing pretty good basketball for about 28 minutes right now,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We got to stretch that. I don't think we will ever get to 48 minutes, but we want to get in the 40s probably after the new year."" Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, had 17 points and 18 rebounds for the Suns, losers of seven in a row since winning their season opener. Isaiah Canaan scored 19 and Devin Booker 18 for Phoenix. Booker returned after missing three games with a strained hamstring. Phoenix trailed by only four early in the fourth quarter before Toronto's decisive 14-2 surge. ""Well, our effort was better,"" Suns first-year coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Having book and Canaan back, I mean that helps a lot. We have to sustain playing a physical, strong team like Toronto. We have to sustain and play 48 minutes. We had a stretch in the fourth quarter that we couldn't handle the physicality, their length, their size. ... And we were just tired."" The Suns led most of the first half but never by more than seven points. Phoenix was up 52-48 at the break, with Canaan scoring 12 points and Ayton adding 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Raptors opened the third quarter with a 13-2 run. Leonard's three-point play on a drive to the hoop put Toronto up 56-54 and Danny Green's 3-pointer from the corner made it 61-54. Phoenix, though, scored the next seven, tying it at 61-61 on Booker's 18-footer. Despite missing four free throws during that stretch, the Raptors responded with a 13-3 run to lead 74-64 after Fred VanVleet's 3-pointer with 2:04 left in the third quarter. Josh Jackson's 3 at the third-quarter buzzer cut Toronto's lead to 77-71 entering the fourth. Jackson's jumper to start the fourth quarter cut it to35 77-73 but the Raptors finally took control for good. VanVleet sank a 3-pointer, followed by a steal and layup and Norman Powell sank a 3 to finish a 14-2 outburst that put the Raptors up 91-75 with 8:35 remaining. Toronto stretched it to 99-81 on Valanciunas' layup. Phoenix outscored the Raptors 17-8 the rest of the way. ""We want to be an aggressive, defense team, get hands on some balls, deflect, get out and transition, get out and get some 3s and layups,"" said Leonard, who jammed his left foot late in the fourth quarter but later said he was OK.

"Jimmy Butler lets reporters know he isn't happy with the constant questions about him sitting out. (0:36) OAKLAND, Calif. --  Draymond Green is playing the best coach Steve Kerr has ever seen, doing all the little things on both ends to spark his team. Stephen Curry's shot is on from everywhere, while Kevin Durant is his usual efficient, dominant self. The two-time defending NBA champions know they can be even better. Durant had 33 points and 13 rebounds, Curry contributed 28 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-99 on Friday night for their seventh straight win. ""Our fourth-quarter defense was tremendous, everybody flying to the ball. I thought Draymond set the tone,"" Kerr said. ""I'm not sure if I've seen Draymond play better since I've been here than what he's doing right now. His defense has always been fantastic, but he's taking such good care of the ball. He had a couple turnovers tonight but over the course of the last few weeks, just the decision-making, the poise, the ability to play through adversity, he knows how much we need him. He's lifting everybody else up. It's been really fun to watch him play."" Klay Thompson scored 22 points and hit consecutive 3-pointers 50 seconds apart early in the fourth to put Golden State ahead 91-89 with 10:17 to play. Green then got back-to-back baskets, one helped by goaltending. Derrick Rose played five minutes in the first quarter for Minnesota and scored three points, then didn't return because of left ankle soreness -- two nights after the 2011 MVP scored a career-high 50 points in a victory against Utah. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 22 points. Minnesota was outrebounded 61-39. Jimmy Butler scored 21 for Minnesota after sitting out Wednesday to rest. Tyus Jones also returned and had eight points on 3-for-11 shooting after missing the win over the Jazz because of a sore right foot. Durant made his first six shots, and eight of the initial 11 he took, on the way to 20 points in the first half. Green had seven of his 11 assists by the 4:40 mark of the opening quarter and has 61 assists over the past six games. He also had nine points and nine boards. ""I think it definitely ignites this crowd for sure. It ignites my teammates as well, just give them something to feed off of, an extra boost of energy to feed off of,"" Green said of all he does. ""That's my job. That's what I bring to this team."" Alfonzo McKinnie added eight points and eight rebounds off the bench in the Warriors' fifth straight home victory against the T-Wolves. Minnesota was outscored 33-12 in the fourth. ""We just didn't hit some shots. It's a two-way street,"" Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""They played great defense, where we also missed some shots that we were hitting the whole game."" Both teams shot 50 percent or better in the first quarter. ""Over the course of 48 (minutes) if we stay locked in and focused, there's going to be a breaking point,"" Curry said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Six players made a 3-pointer in the first half. ...

Yet that doesn't mean Cousins will be in games anytime soon. ""I love how far he's come, but I don't want people to get the idea that he's getting close to coming back,"" Kerr said.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Philadelphia star big man Joel Embiid revels in the chances to go against Detroit center Andre Drummond. And Embiid doesn't stop going at Drummond when the game is over. Embiid scored 32 of his 39 points in a dominating first half and had 17 rebounds and then let Drummond know about it afterward, leading the 76ers to a 109-99 victory over the Pistons on Saturday. Embiid made 10 of 18 field goals and 18 of 23 free throws to help Philadelphia improve to 6-0 at home. Drummond and Embiid have butted heads throughout their careers, with Embiid recently saying he ""owns real estate"" in Drummond's head after Detroit's big man was ejected in the Pistons' 133-132 overtime victory on Oct. 23. ""He's a fun matchup,"" Embiid said. ""I feel like I dominate every game, especially against him."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey and Drummond questioned the officiating. Drummond and backup center Zaza Pachulia were in foul trouble early trying to guard Embiid, and the teams combined for 63 fouls and 92 free-throw attempts. ""I don't understand how the game was being called,"" Casey said. Said Drummond, ""It's like you have to play with your hands behind your back; you can't really touch nobody. That's the way they're calling the game right now. I have to figure a way to adjust. It's hard to play like that."" Embiid's first-half numbers were astounding. He made 8 of 9 shots, including his only 3-point attempt, and 15 of 17 free-throw attempts with eight rebounds and two blocks in 17 minutes in a one-sided duel with Drummond. Drummond went scoreless in four foul-plagued minutes in the opening half and finished with eight points and nine rebounds in 21 minutes. Embiid went right at Drummond early on Saturday, drawing a foul just 1:24 into the contest and then a second on Drummond 1:16 later. The Philadelphia big man held up two fingers after that one, letting everyone know Drummond had picked up his second, and Drummond exited to the bench for Pachulia. Pachulia was no match for Embiid either, drawing four fouls in 10 first-half minutes. The 76ers' lead grew to as many as 24 points, 58-34, when rookie Landry Shamet converted a three-point play after draining a 13-foot jumper and the ensuing free throw. The Pistons scored the first 13 points of the second half over 3:55 as Philadelphia went 0-for-5 with three turnovers to start the third period. That surge cut Detroit's deficit to nine, 69-60, but the 76ers' advantage built up in the opening 24 minutes proved to be too great. Detroit got as close as down five with 4:48 remaining before an Embiid layup and J.J. Redick 3-pointer pushed the lead to a comfortable 10 points. SECOND-HALF SURGE Casey said the Pistons have to start contests like they began the second half on Saturday. ""Our starts have been atrocious,"" Casey said. ""If we come out at the start of the game like the second half, we're a pretty good team. I loved our defensive effort in the second half. SECOND-HALF SLIDE After shooting 53 percent from the field (19-for-36), including 43 percent from the arc (6-for-14) in the opening 24 minutes, Philadelphia slipped to 27 percent (9-for-33) and 20 percent (3-for-15), respectively, after halftime.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  This was the effort Hornets coach James Borrego was hoping to get from Jeremy Lamb when he named him the team's starting shooting guard before the season. Lamb had a season-high 19 points and eight rebounds, and Charlotte made light work of the Cleveland Cavaliers, winning 126-94 on Saturday night. Borrego said Lamb was ""fantastic,"" and now wants to see him bring that same aggressive attack-the-basket mentality every night. ""This is where I see Jeremy helping us,"" Borrego said. ""I think he fits in that starting unit. ... I loved his aggressiveness tonight, getting to the rim. I think he got to the paint more than anybody tonight. If people want to put two guys on Kemba (Walker) that's his time to attack and a lot of his attacks and aggressiveness now are in transition."" Borrego said his only concern with Lamb entering the season was if he could guard the opposing team's shooter night after night. He's had some help so far from Nic Batum, but it's clear he has improved in that area. ""Night after night at the two guard position you have to be ready to guard,"" Lamb said. ""I've been working to try to keep getting better on both ends of the floor. Defensively is a big thing I need to work on, and I'm gonna keep working."" Two-time All-Star Kemba Walker had 18 points and Malik Monk added 16 for the Hornets, who improved to .500 on the season. Charlotte had balanced scoring throughout, with seven players finishing in double digits, including five off the bench. J.R. Smith scored 14 points for the struggling Cavaliers (1-8), who are playing without the injured Kevin Love and put up very little resistance on defense. The Hornets looked sluggish early on, but broke the game open late in the third behind a 26-11 run that made it a 20-point game. Tony Parker, who has been a big addition for the Hornets as a player and as a leader of the second team, led the way during the key stretch, scoring on a pair of floaters and then delivering a perfect alley-oop pass to Monk, who soared above the rim after losing his man on a backdoor cut. Unlike Thursday night, when the Hornets surrendered a 19-point third quarter lead to Russell Westbrook and the Thunder, Charlotte had no intention of letting this one slip away. They quickly extended the lead to 29 points when Walker knocked down his fourth 3-pointer with 7:14 remaining in the game. He exited the game shortly after. TIP INS Cavaliers: Were outrebounded 49-28. ... Kyle Korver had 11 points, with three 3-pointers. Hornets: Owner Michael Jordan took in the game courtside, sitting at the end of the Hornets' bench. ... David Tepper, the owner of the other major sports franchise in the city, the NFL's Carolina Panthers, also attended the game. BENCH GETTING IT DONE The Hornets entered the game second in the NBA in bench scoring and got it done again against the Cavs with five reserves scoring in double digits. Borrego said he feels like the second unit is establishing an identity, adding that ""I love our bench."" ""They are playing with haste, playing with urgency,"" Borrego said. ""Tony Parker understands what we're trying to get done offensively and getting Malik Monk in the right spots."" DIFFERENT LOOKS Cavaliers acting head coach Larry Drew used several different combinations on the floor throughout the night, but nothing seemed to work. ""This team is obviously going in a different direction than it's been the last four years,"" Drew said of the post-LeBron James era. ""As a coach, you still have to find what works. And right now I don't know what works for this team. Trying to mix it up and give it a different look as far as playing guys and different combinations. ""","401070807"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo heard the final buzzer and pranced to the sideline, pointing both index fingers to the floor, and mouthing, ""My city."" Oladipo's 3-pointer with 3.4 seconds remaining Saturday night gave Indiana a 102-101 comeback victory over the Boston Celtics and was yet another example of his increasingly routine heroics at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The All-Star guard, who was battling bronchitis, finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds and said he envisions his heroics. ""Moments like this, yeah,"" Oladipo said, ""and moments like this down the line."" The game was a tense affair with 10 ties and 18 lead changes and a compelling matchup between Indiana and Boston. The Celtics led 101-97 when Kyrie Irving hit a 3 with 37.2 seconds to go, but Jaylen Brown fouled Oladipo at 29.2 seconds, and he made both free throws to set up the dramatic finish. With 11 seconds left, Oladipo rebounded Irving's miss, dribbled across midcourt and pulled up from the right wing, launching over the outstretched arms of Boston center Al Horford. As the ball dropped through the net, Oladipo skipped toward the bench. ""We were really calm,"" Oladipo said. ""The crowd was excited, but we were calm. We knew we needed one more stop."" After the Celtics used a timeout to advance the ball and draw up a final play, Gordon Hayward inbounded but had his pass deflected and stolen by Oladipo, snapping a four-game win streak for Boston, which reached the Eastern Conference finals last spring. The Pacers, coming off a first-round playoff exit, passed an early-season test in large part by repeatedly earning free throws. While Boston attempted only nine, and made six, Indiana shot 19 of 25 from the line. That came in handy on a night Boston shot 43 percent (38 for 88) and the Pacers 41 percent (36 for 87). ""We're living on the edge a little too much,"" said Horford, who had 14 points and six rebounds. ""Maybe this will wake us up."" Tyreke Evans had 17 points for the Pacers, Bojan Bogdanovic scored 16, and Domantas Sabonis added 12 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Indiana trailed 28-18 after the first quarter, and by as many as 13 in the first half, but forged a tie at 45 at halftime and knotted the score at 72 on Evans' last-second 3 to close the third period. ""It was huge moving forward, just to get a good spirit and energy for our season,"" Indiana guard Darren Collison said. ""We all came together. Everybody had their moments. In those situations when you're playing a good team you can't lose focus. You just never know when the game is going to change."" Marcus Morris had a team-high 23 points and six rebounds for the Celtics. ""We got beat by a good team,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""Oladipo made a big shot."" TIP-INS Celtics: Irving finished with 18 points and six boards, and Hayward was the only starter not to score in double figures, finishing with four points and seven rebounds. . Marcus Smart contributed three points and nine assists. . The loss also snapped Boston's three-game win streak in Indianapolis. Pacers: TJ Leaf, a second-year forward out of UCLA, entered with only two points all season but scored five Saturday in his customary second-quarter stint. Leaf played the first five minutes of the fourth quarter and added a dunk to finish with seven points. . The team waived forward Ben Moore and recalled center Ike Anigbogu from the G League. WORKING HIS WAY BACK Stevens said Hayward, coming back from leg surgery, would remain restricted to fewer than 30 minutes per game for the foreseeable future. ""He's in the `increase by a tick' phase,"" Stevens said. ""We'll just keep evaluating him week to week. It's a long-term plan based on getting him back to not only playing one game but 82 games. He's probably pretty frustrated by it at times, but does a good job not showing it."" DEJ<U+FFFD> VU Oladipo's shot came just more than one year after his first signature finger-pointing, ""My city"" celebration. On Oct. 29, 2017, three months after being traded to Indiana from Oklahoma City, Oladipo's 3-pointer gave the Pacers a 97-94 win over San Antonio.","401070808"
"ATLANTA --  On one of the best nights of his young career, Trae Young's favorite pass set up Vince Carter, the league's oldest player. Young had 24 points and a career-high 15 assists, Carter's jumper gave Atlanta the lead for good, and the Hawks beat Josh Richardson and the Miami Heat 123-118 on Saturday. Carter's 17-foot jumper off a pass from the 20-year-old Young broke a 118-all tie. ""Vince is the man,"" Young said of the 41-year-old Carter. ""It was crazy, like a little throwback moment for me. From a few guys talking in here after the game, it was a throwback moment for everybody."" Taurean Prince and Dewayne Dedmon each scored 15 points for the Hawks, who had dropped four in a row. Young also had six rebounds in his ninth NBA game. Carter had 12 points despite giving up his starting spot so rookie Omari Spellman could make his first start. ""It was Vince Carter being a pro, wanting to help some other guys get going and sacrificing,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Richardson scored 32 points, setting a career high for the second time this week, but Miami was held scoreless in the final three minutes of its third straight loss. The Heat trailed by 15 in the third quarter before rallying to a 111-110 lead in the fourth. Players on each team were quick to launch 3-pointers in the fast-paced game. The Hawks made 13 of 32 3s, and the Heat connected on 16 of 40, including 6 of 10 by Richardson. Miami allowed more than 120 points for the third straight game. ""I feel like there wasn't a whole lot of defense being played both ways,"" Richardson said. ""We let them score too easy."" A 12-0 run, capped by a 3-pointer and pullup jumper by Young, gave Atlanta its biggest lead at 86-71. Young dribbled through traffic and made a short floater at the buzzer to give Atlanta a 102-93 lead entering the final period. Richardson's jumper tied it at 116. Following a flagrant foul against Justise Winslow, Young's two free throws got the lead back for Atlanta. Miami held out point guard Goran Dragic due to persistent pain in his right foot. Dragic, second on the team with 17.7 points per game, had a cortisone shot earlier in the week. Dwyane Wade had 19 points for the Heat. TIP-INS Heat: Wayne Ellington made his season debut after returning from a left ankle injury. He finished with five points. ...

JERSEY SWAP Wade and Carter swapped jerseys following the game. Wade, who has announced this is his final NBA season, said he enjoyed the on-court competition with Carter. ""We were having fun,"" the 36-year-old Wade said. ""Guys our age, that's what we're here for, to enjoy the game. He's a little older than me but we're here to enjoy the game.

"CHICAGO -- James Harden wasn't quite back in MVP form, yet he was good enough when the Houston Rockets needed him. Harden scored 25 points, including 11 in a decisive run in the third quarter in his return to the Houston lineup, and the Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls 96-88 on Saturday night. Harden, the NBA's reigning MVP, had missed three games with a strained left hamstring. He connected for 11 straight points, including three 3-pointers, in a span of 1 minute, 59 seconds in the third as the Rockets went on a 15-0 run. ""Just playing in a full game, contact and all that, felt like it's been a minute,"" Harden said. ""So I just wanted to get out there and just try to be myself. ""I think I did a pretty good job of that. Too many turnovers [eight], but once I get my flow back in rhythm, those will [decrease]."" Harden also had seven assists, and guard Chris Paul has no doubts Harden be his old self before long. ""It was good to see James get going in his first game back,"" Paul said. ""For us, it's about building."" Carmelo Anthony had 17 points and James Ennis added 15 despite just over 17 minutes of playing time as the Rockets won their second game in two nights after starting the season 1-5. Chicago led 59-58 midway through the third quarter before the Rockets and Harden went ahead for good, outscoring the Bulls 21-7 in the period. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 21 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. had 14 points and 13 rebounds. Jabari Parker added 15 points as the Bulls lost their fourth consecutive game -- going 0-4 in the homestand -- and dropped their fifth straight to the Rockets. Houston opened a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter. Chicago narrowed it to five points with 4:01 left using a 12-2 run and capitalizing on stretch of cold shooting by Houston. ""We shut it down, and once you shut it down you can't turn it back on,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We had one bad quarter and unfortunately it was a really bad third quarter,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We were settling for shots. In fourth quarter, we got back in it by attacking the rim and getting to the free throw line."" The Bulls finished with 19 turnovers, including what Hoiberg called ""mindless"" ones down the stretch, to blunt their late comeback. Harden began slowly in his return to the starting lineup. He didn't score until completing a driving layup with 3:55 left in the second quarter. Then he hit back-to-back 3s and had 10 points at the half. Harden suffered the hamstring injury near the end of the loss to Utah on Oct. 24, and Houston was routed in the next two games. The Rockets beat the Nets in Brooklyn 119-111 on Friday as Harden got an extra day of rest. Guard Eric Gordon was held out of Saturday's game with abductor strain, suffered at Brooklyn. The Bulls held their own with the Rockets in a see-saw, open first half and led 56-54 at intermission. Neither team had more than a five-point lead in the first half. Ennis, in his second game back after missing three with a strained right hamstring, led all scorers with 13 points at the half. Parker had 11 for Chicago. ENNIS THE (POTENTIAL) MENACE D'Antoni praised Ennis' effort and thinks the 28-year-old forward will only improve as his hamstring gets stronger. ""The guy can play,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's been hampered by the hamstring since the first game. But 15 points in 17 minutes [17:18] and the energy he gives you ... he's going to be really good."" TIP-INS Rockets: Before the game D'Antoni didn't have details of Gordon's injury, but thought the guard, who has averaged 15 points through seven games, would be out day-to-day. ""Now we get James back, but we lose Eric,"" D'Antoni said, while noting injuries to top players have taxed other Rockets who aren't used to as much playing time. ... D'Antoni's voice was raspy and barely audible before Saturday's game. He attributed it to his team pulling out its second victory of the season at Brooklyn on Friday. ""I celebrated last night and lost my voice,"" D'Antoni said ""We won a game."" Bulls: Hoiberg expects his injury-depleted team will soon get a boost from the return of F Lauri Markkanen (right elbow sprain) and G Denzel Valentine (left ankle sprain), but still doesn't have an exact timetable. ""Denzel will continue to ramp up his activity in the next couple days, and Lauri is doing a little bit more still,"" Hoiberg said, adding that Markkanen might be ready to ""get on floor"" in about a week. ... Hoiberg said Bobby Portis (right knee sprain) and Kris Dunn (left knee sprain) ""are still a ways away.""","401070810"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs were nearly flawless in their execution against New Orleans, and that only added to the consternation of Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. DeMar DeRozan had 26 points, LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points and 12 rebounds and the Spurs defeated New Orleans 109-95 Saturday, handing the Pelicans their fifth straight loss. New Orleans has lost all five by double digits after opening the season with four straight wins. Gentry could be heard yelling at his team in their locker room following the game. ""We're trying to hit grand slams when all we need to do is hit singles,"" Gentry said. ""We need to just move the basketball and let the game come to us and stop trying to force the issue. We've done that the last few games. We have to get back to being who we are, that's a team that moves the basketball that makes elementary simple plays and execute. That's the way you win games in the league, that's exactly what they just did."" San Antonio had nine turnovers, including five in the fourth quarter when the outcome was essentially decided. Dante Cunningham had a season-high 15 points and Patty Mills had 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists as San Antonio won its fourth straight. Jrue Holiday had 29 points and Anthony Davis had 17 points and eight rebounds to lead the Pelicans. Davis returned after missing Thursday's game with a sprained right elbow. San Antonio held New Orleans to 17 points in the opening period and 39 points in the first half, season lows for each team. The Spurs became the first team to hold the Pelicans below 100 points this season. ""(The team's defense is) coming along, you know, we just preach consistency,"" DeRozan said. ""The coaching staff and Pop stay on us every day about the same thing. We keep in mind every time we go out there to be better defensively and its showing."" After trailing 15-8, the Spurs moved out to a two-point lead on a 11-2 run sparked by Cunningham diving on the floor defensively for a loose ball. ""That's why I guess I got moved into the lineup,"" Cunningham said. ""That's what he (Spurs coach Gregg Popovich) wants out of me. That's my thing, I guess. So, if coach wants me to set the tone, I have the set the tone, I have to give that energy and be ready to give it every night."" San Antonio's bench continued to control the play, outscoring New Orleans 33-13, including 14 points by Marco Belinelli. The Pelicans finished with 16 turnovers and shot 17 for 30 from the line. ""We're not playing defense, we're not guarding anybody,"" Davis said. ""We're making the game harder on ourselves. It shouldn't be this hard to score buckets and so easy for them on the other end."" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans has been outscored by an average of 14.6 points in their five-game skid. . Davis grabbed his left knee in pain after colliding with Cunningham for a loose ball with 6 minutes remaining but quickly smiled and rose after the initial burst of pain. . The Pelicans scored 17 points in the first quarter and 39 points in the first half, both season lows. Their previous season low for a quarter was 18 points in the second against Utah on Oct. 27 and 24 in the opening period against Denver on Oct. 29. New Orleans' previous low for the first half was 45 points against Denver on Oct. 29. Spurs: DeRozan has scored at least 25 points in seven of the team's first eight games this season. The only other San Antonio player to do so was George Gervin in 1978-79. . The Spurs are 44-17 against the Hornets/Pelicans since they relocated to New Orleans in 2003. It's the most victories against the city's second NBA franchise by any team. . Cunningham had scored 20 points total in the team's first seven games. His previous high was four points, which he scored in the team's previous three games. WELCOME BACK Retired Spurs guard Manu Ginobili received a thunderous ovation when he appeared on the video screens at the AT&amp;T Center late in the game. It was Ginobili's first game as a spectator since retiring from the Spurs in July. WELCOME ADDITION Cunningham started his fifth game, which is probably five more starts than the Spurs expected when they signed him late in the offseason. The 6-foot-8 forward has given San Antonio a needed boost defensively. ""Dante has been not exactly a surprise, but we didn't expect him to be playing all these minutes and he's taking advantage of the opportunity,"" Popovich said. ""I think he's been really good for us. He sets the tone defensively.""","401070811"
"DENVER --  Mason Plumlee watched as his 3-pointer swished through the net, and the big man started to shimmy down the court as the Denver bench erupted in celebration. No one expected Plumlee to drain one from beyond the arc, but the Nuggets are doing a lot of things nobody expected this season. Gary Harris scored 20 points and Malik Beasley and Plumlee hit key 3-pointers in a fourth-quarter flurry, leading Denver to a 103-88 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. The Nuggets outscored the Jazz 35-15 in the fourth thanks to a gritty defense and Plumlee's first 3-pointer. He had only taken 18 shots from beyond the arc in his five-year career, including one this season. But this time, he drained one in front of his own bench during an 18-0 run. ""It was the end of the shot clock and we had to get it up so I took it,"" Plumlee said. ""It's funny how it started a run. They took a timeout so I could have more time to have fun."" Jamal Murray scored 19 for Denver, which won its fourth straight and has won eight of nine games so far. The Nuggets' great start is due, in part, to an improved defense that is allowing just 101.9 points a game, almost seven fewer than last season. It's a pace they want to continue throughout the season. ""We're 8-1 and we have one of the best defenses in the NBA, so why not?"" coach Michael Malone said. ""That's our challenge. Let's not get soft with success."" Jae Crowder scored 21 points off the bench for Utah, which has lost three straight. The Jazz got a scare when guard Donovan Mitchell left the game in the fourth quarter with a left ankle injury. Mitchell, who finished with 16 points, missed Friday night's loss to Memphis with a right hamstring injury. He was helped off favoring his left leg, but returned a few minutes later. ""I was just being a baby,"" Mitchell said. ""I'm good. I've twisted an ankle before. It's not a great feeling. I don't tape my ankles, so I'll probably start."" Denver's Nikola Jokic flirted with a triple-double, but finished three points shy of the mark. He had a season-high 16 assists and 10 rebounds. He finished with seven points and has scored just 11 in the last two games combined, but Denver has won both. The Jazz led 77-71 early in the fourth quarter but went cold as Denver took control. Beasley's 3-pointer gave the Nuggets a 79-77 lead and Plumlee beat the shot clock with another 3 that increased the lead to five. Utah missed seven straight shots during a 24-3 run by Denver that turned a six-point deficit into a 95-80 lead. Denver held the Jazz to four made field goals in the fourth. ""A lot of effort, man,"" Plumlee said of the defense. ""Schematically we're not doing anything different but the multiple effort's there."" The Jazz shot 40.7 from the field and just 19.4 percent from 3-point range. ""The score didn't reflect our effort,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""But ultimately you've got to put the ball in the basket. We weren't able to do that in the fourth quarter."" TIP-INS Jazz: G Alec Burks missed his third straight game with a chip fracture in his left hand. He has not played in the last four games. ... Favors played 19 minutes despite dealing with left knee soreness. He finished with 12 points. Nuggets: Denver started the 1976-77 season 8-0, the first season it was in the NBA. ... The Nuggets have held four of their opponents to below 100 points. They've won all four games. HOME SWEET HOME Denver won 31 games at Pepsi Center last season and is 5-0 at home to start this year. It's a big difference from four seasons ago when the Nuggets finished below 19-22 in Denver. ""I remember getting booed off the court. Nobody was there and tonight it was a sellout,"" Harris said. ""It shows you how far we've come but we still have a long way to go.""","401070812"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  It took LeBron James to help the Los Angeles Lakers snap a lengthy losing streak against Portland. James had 28 points and seven assists and the Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers 114-110 Saturday night. The Lakers snapped the franchise's 16-game losing streak against the Blazers. In addition to the streak, Saturday was the Lakers' first road win this season against a team with a winning record. ""Great to snap that,"" James said of the Lakers' streak of futility against Portland. ""They're a very good team, obviously. To beat Portland, you can't just come in and win without playing really hard and really well."" Rajon Rondo gave the Lakers a huge lift off the bench, finishing with 17 points and 10 assists in 25 minutes. Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum each scored 30 points for Portland. The Lakers used a 16-0 run in the third quarter to take a 17-point lead. Josh Hart hit a 3-pointer with 9:44 left that gave the Lakers their biggest lead at 95-75, forcing a Portland timeout. And the timeout might have been just what Portland needed to get back into the game. The Blazers went on a 22-8 run, cutting the Lakers' lead to six points with 3:34 left after a layup by Jusuf Nurkic. Sloppy play once again came back to hurt the Lakers in the fourth quarter, but the Blazers couldn't get much closer as James and JaVale McGee made crucial baskets in the final two minutes. ""LeBron closed them out over the final three minutes,"" Lakers head coach Luke Walton said of James. McGee, who James said is a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, also had six blocks to add to his league-leading total. ""He's doing a little bit of everything,"" James said of McGee. ""He's leading the league in blocks. And tonight he saved us and covered our defensive mistakes with blocks at the rim."" Portland shot a 6 for 35 (17 percent) from beyond the arc and shot just 42 percent from the field overall. ""Our defense won us the game tonight,"" Walton said. ""They missed some 3s, but we were contesting, chasing over the top and defending."" The Lakers had seven turnovers in the fourth quarter and finished with 20 overall, but they survived their mistakes. The Lakers sped to a good start, but the Blazers quickly regained control. Turnovers and second chances fueled a 17-2 run by Portland in the first quarter. The Lakers bench helped get Los Angeles back into the game in the first half and outscored the Blazers subs 51-26. ""Our second unit was outstanding tonight,"" Walton said. ""Rondo led it and then the lift that (Ivica) Zubac gave us off the bench was incredible."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Blazers head coach Terry Stotts says it's hard to get a handle for where his team really is on the defensive end due to the league's uptick in pace and scoring so far this season. ""It's hard to get a handle around the league where defense is,"" Stotts said. ""The numbers say we're 11th but it doesn't feel like it, but we are. I think this season has to settle in to see where we are with it. Unless you hold a team to 80 or 90 you'll always find things you have to get better at."" Lakers: Phoenix Suns center Tyson Chandler will join the Lakers once he clears waivers after agreeing to a contract buyout. A person with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the buyout plan to The Associated Press on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Suns had not yet revealed it publicly. While Lakers head coach Luke Walton dodged direct questions about the move, Stotts likes what Chandler brings to the table for the Lakers. Stotts coached Chandler in Dallas in 2011. ""I like Tyson Chandler,"" Stotts said. ""Great teammate, obviously that was a few years ago but he impacts the game at the defensive end. He's a great locker room guy, great teammate. He's all about winning. So, any team that has Tyson is going to be better for it.""","401070813"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo is taking his game to another level. He had his second triple-double this season with 26 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists to help the Milwaukee Bucks rout the Sacramento Kings 144-109 on Sunday. ""A great win for the team,"" Antetokounmpo said, deflecting any sense of personal satisfaction. ""When I drove the ball, they were wide open. I passed it, and they knocked down everything."" The Bucks improved to 8-1 -- the best nine-game start in franchise history. They set a season high for points in a game and also set the franchise record for 3s made with 22. Coach Mike Budenholzer was happy his team followed Antetokounmpo's lead. ""Hopefully, one of the keys to Giannis being great is everybody around him being great,"" the Bucks first-year coach said. ""We can also talk about a lot of other guys who played well, too. So, that's a great sign for Giannis and a great sign for us."" Seven other Bucks were in double figures. Eric Bledsoe scored 17, Ersan Ilyasova 15, Malcolm Brogdon and Pat Connaughton each had 13, Tony Snell and Khris Middleton each had 12 and John Henson 10. ""Coach Bud (head coach Mike Budenholzer) wants me to make plays and find them,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""That is what I am going to keep doing. It feels great."" Antetokounmpo completed the triple-double with his 10th assist when he found Connaughton in the corner for 3 and a 108-82 lead as time expired in the third quarter. Antetokounmpo finally went to the bench with 7:48 left in the fourth and the Bucks comfortably ahead 118-90. He pushed the lead to 78-54 with two thunderous dunks seconds apart in the third quarter. He slammed one home and then dunked again on a pass from Middleton after a turnover by De'Aaron Fox on the Kings' ensuing possession. Antetokounmpo's first triple-double came against the Philadelphia 76ers on Oct. 24th when he had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists. Justin Jackson set a career-high with 22 points, Buddy Hield had 19 and De'Aaron Fox 15 for the Kings who had their five-game winning streak snapped. Jackson felt the team was still upbeat despite the most lopsided loss this season. The Kings had lost 149-129 at New Orleans on Oct. 19. ""We just went 3-1 on a four-game road trip,"" Jackson said. ""Obviously, it hurts a little bit to lose like that, but I think we're extremely happy of how we played this road trip."" The Bucks started to take over with 12-2 run in the second quarter, keyed by seven points from Malcolm Brogdon, and led 72-48 on Ersan Ilyasova's 3 with 49 seconds left before the half. Ilyasova scored 15 points and Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe each added 13 as the Bucks surged to their best first half of scoring so far this season and led 72-50 heading into the third. Both teams let in fly from behind the arc. Milwaukee made 11 of 29 3-point attempts, including three by Ilyasova, to Sacramento's 6 for 19. TIP-INS Kings: Hield came in with five straight games of 20 or more points. ... Willie Cauley-Stein went to the bench with his fifth foul at 9:13 of the third. Bucks: G Sterling Brown was recalled from the Wisconsin Herd of the G League. The Bucks sent him to their affiliate to get some playing time. FROM BEYOND THE ARC The Bucks set a franchise high with 56 three-point attempts. ""Obviously, just to get up to 56 3-point attempts is a lot, but that's what they do,"" Kings head coach Dave Joerger said. ""They were effective."" STAT LINE The Bucks' 144 points are the team's most in a non-overtime game since scoring 147 against the San Antonio Spurs on March 18, 1979.","401070814"
"NEW YORK --  Nearly half the fourth quarter remained when 76ers coach Brett Brown pulled Joel Embiid from the game. Embiid wasn't helping, anyway. In the sloppiest performance in the NBA this season, Philadelphia threw the ball just about everywhere except to its All-Star center. D'Angelo Russell snapped out of a slump with 13 of his 21 points in the second half, and the Brooklyn Nets kept the 76ers winless on the road with a 122-97 victory on Sunday night. The 76ers committed 28 turnovers, most in the NBA this season, leading to 39 points for the Nets. ""That is not who we are,"" Brown said. ""And I give credit to Brooklyn, but that is an unacceptable performance."" Brown added that the 76ers weren't currently among the elite in the Eastern Conference, and his players didn't argue after they fell to 0-5 away from home. They are 6-0 in Philadelphia. ""We've been playing soft,"" said guard Ben Simmons, adding an expletive to describe the team's play. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson also scored 21 points and Caris LeVert had 20 for the Nets. They took a small lead into halftime thanks to 17 Philadelphia turnovers, then blew it open with a 41-point third quarter that was one of the biggest in Barclays Center history. They kept pouring it on in the fourth and Brown removed Embiid and Simmons facing a 24-point deficit. ""I would say turning the ball over a lot of the time is being lackadaisical or trying to force something that isn't there,"" Russell said. ""I think everybody was aggressive tonight, 1 through 5."" Embiid finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds but got only eight shots a day after going for 39 points and 17 rebounds in a victory over Detroit. Simmons had 20 points and 12 boards. ""It's not Golden State. We shouldn't lose a game to Brooklyn by that many points,"" Embiid said. ""We didn't compete."" Russell was only 4 for 12 for eight points in the first half, a game after the former No. 2 pick sat the entire fourth quarter in the Nets' loss to Houston after going 5 for 14. But he had nine points in the third and he was only on the bench as the final minutes ticked down this time because there was no crunch time. Joe Harris snapped a 61-all tie with a 3-pointer, Russell scored five straight and Harris made another 3 to make it 72-61. JJ Redick scored to end that drought but it didn't change the momentum, as the Nets scored 15 of the next 21 points to open an 87-69 lead. The 76ers limited the Nets to 5-of-28 shooting in the first quarter but led only 21-18 in part because of their 10 turnovers. Philadelphia coughed it up seven more times in the second and the Nets led 51-47 at halftime. TIP-INS 76ers: Wilson Chandler rested a day after making his 76ers debut following a strained left hamstring by playing 10 minutes. ... Philadelphia had a three-game winning streak against Brooklyn snapped. Nets: Brooklyn improved to 9-4 against Philadelphia at Barclays Center, tied for the most victories against any opponent since moving from New Jersey. The Nets have also beaten Orlando nine times. ... Jarrett Allen had 15 points and 10 rebounds. SHOOTING STREAK Harris made a 3-pointer in his 25th straight game, moving into sole possession of fourth place on the Nets' career list. Joe Johnson hit at least one in 37 in a row in 2014. FAMILIAR FACES The Nets have used the same starting five (LeVert, Russell, Harris, Jared Dudley and Allen) for each of the first 10 games of the season. The last time they did that was in the 2002-03 season, when Jason Kidd, Kerry Kittles, Richard Jefferson, Kenyon Martin and Dikembe Mutombo started the first 16 in a row. BIG THREE The 41-point third quarter was one off the Nets' high in Barclays Center, which opened in 2012. They had a 42-point third against Golden State last season and against the 76ers on Dec. 16, 2013.","401070815"
"WASHINGTON -- The Washington Wizards entered their game against the New York Knicks with the NBA's worst defense and mired in a five-game losing streak. In eight games, the Wizards had given up an average of nearly 124 points. That led Washington coach Scott Brooks to make a wry observation: ""We're leading a lot of the categories in the wrong way.'' Things turned around on Sunday as John Wall scored 26 points, Bradley Beal added 22 and the Wizards defeated the Knicks 108-95. The win left Brooks sounding a bit more upbeat when asked what he most liked about the game. ""That I didn't see triple digits,'' Brooks said. ""It was nice to see it below 100.'' After the Knicks cut a 13-point lead in the third quarter and tied the score for the third time at 86-all with 9:13 to play, Washington held New York to just nine points. Markieff Morris had 16 points and Jeff Green scored 14 for Washington, which won for the second time in nine games. ""I don't know what sparked it, but that's what we needed,'' Beal said. ""It was put together for the whole 48 minutes for the first time. In games past, we'd play a good first half or a good second half.'' The Knicks, who fell to 3-7, were led by Enes Kanter's 18 points and 12 rebounds. Trey Burke had 13 points. Washington forced 20 New York turnovers. That was a season high for the Wizards. ""We were very careless with the ball tonight, and they deserve a lot of credit for that,'' Knicks coach David Fizdale said. TIP-INS Knicks: F Kevin Knox missed his seventh game with a sprained left ankle. Knox thinks he's ready to play. Fizdale isn't so sure. ""He's not making the diagnosis -- my 19-year-old rookie. I told him I want him to play 5-on-5 first. I know he feels great, but at the same time we have to be sure.'' ... G Courtney Lee has yet to play this year with neck spasms. ""I couldn't [give an estimate],'' Fizdale said. ""I have no idea. I'm hoping soon, just for his sake. He's been such a pro, and he's been really engaged, but I know it's killing him.'' G Tim Hardaway was held to seven points in 24 minutes. He suffered a back injury in the first quarter but returned to the game. Wizards: F Otto Porter was out with a bruised left big toe. Brooks said the injury was day-to-day and didn't know if Porter would practice Monday. ... Wall hit three 3-pointers. He has 500 in his career. ... C Dwight Howard was assessed a flagrant-1 foul when he attempted to block Kanter's shot midway through the second quarter. SMILING HOWARD Howard scored 10 points and had 10 rebounds in 31 minutes in his second game. He missed the first seven games with a sore backside. ""If you want me to judge him after two games, he did pretty good,'' Brooks said. ""I like his enthusiasm. I like his smile. He's a good-looking guy, and he uses it all the time.'' Howard said the smiling was a sign of weakness. ""I was smiling because I was saying, 'Damn, I can't get off the ground tonight.''' Brooks called a play for Howard to catch a lob. ""I was like, 'Coach, my legs are not there, yet, so I have to keep smiling my way through it.'"" TECH TALK Besides Howard's flagrant, New York C Mitchell Robinson was called for a technical. Wall and Knicks G Allonzo Trier were called for a double technical. ""It's important that they're not going to back down from anybody,'' Hardaway said. ""They don't care who it is. I'm happy they did that. If I was in that situation, I probably would have gotten thrown out the game.'' 3-POINT WOES Washington limited New York to 5-for-27 shooting on 3-pointers (18.5 percent). In their first eight games, the Wizards gave up at least 10 3s. ""We treated everybody as a hot player, no matter who he was,'' Brooks said.","401070816"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Orlando Magic's best victory of the season was almost their most deflating loss. Aaron Gordon scored 26 points and Orlando held on to beat the San Antonio Spurs 117-110 on Sunday night after nearly blowing a 26-point lead with 9 minutes remaining. D.J Augustin added 18 points for Orlando, which made 12 3-pointers in scoring a season high. ""It's a great feeling to get a good win on the road against a great team like that who's playing well now,"" Augustin said. ""It's great for our confidence it's what we've been looking for to get us going in a good direction."" DeMar DeRozan had 25 points as San Antonio's four-game winning streak came to an end on the second night of a back-to-back. ""No excuses, everyone has back-to-backs,"" said Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge who added 14 points.  We just came in and we didn't play as good at defense as we can. We'll get better and be better at it next game. Orlando snapped a four-game skid, but had to bring its starters back into the game to preserve the victory. The Spurs went on a 25-6 run over 6 minutes to erase the Magic's 105-79 with 9:02 remaining and close within five points with less than 2 minutes left. ""We can't let go, we can't take our foot of the gas,"" Gordon said. ""You've got to be able to finish thoroughly or teams will come back."" San Antonio veteran Pau Gasol sparked the run by blocking and collecting Gordon's shot and racing downcourt, where he was fouled with 7 minutes remaining. Gasol's hustle led Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to reinsert DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes back into the game despite Orlando leading by 18 points. The Spurs responded with a 9-2 run to pull within 107-96 with 5:28 remaining and forced Magic coach Steve Clifford to take a timeout to slow the momentum. Clifford was forced to take another timeout 2 1/2 minutes later when Bryn Forbes' 3-pointer cut Orlando's lead to 111-104. ""We had the game at a place where were ahead by enough and that's where we stopped playing defense and they took advantage of it,"" Clifford said. ""That three-minute stretch in the fourth quarter, where they were good and we lost our concentration, except for that, I thought our defense was good all night."" Gasol's 3-pointer pulled the Spurs within 113-108 with 1:41 remaining, but the Magic were able to salvage the win and preserve their best offensive performance of the season. Orlando failed to score 100 points in its three previous games, but jumped out to an early lead. ""They deserve a lot of credit,"" Popovich said. ""They were really efficient offensively and haven't been all year. They've been at the bottom of the league in offensive efficiency and a lot of it is because it's a new system."" Mills finished with 16 points and Gasol finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes. Terrence Ross added 17 points off the bench for Orlando. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando entered the game last in the league in scoring at 99.9 points per game as well as field goal percentage at 41.4. ... Former Spurs forward Jonathon Simmons received a warm ovation upon entering the game late in the first quarter. Simmons, who was listed as questionable with bruised right wrist, had no points in 18 minutes. ... Jonathan Isaac did not play due to a sprained right ankle. ... Timofey Mozgov missed the game with sore right knee. Spurs: Jakob Poeltl played 14 minutes, including starting the second half. It was the most minutes Poeltl has played since logging 13 minutes against Indiana on Oct. 24. He finished with two points and five rebounds. . Marco Belinelli finished with 15 points, one shy of his season high. Belinelli was 2 for 5 on 3-pointers. ADAPTING DeRozan is averaging 1.1 steals per game, which matches his career high, and is on pace to collect the most steals in his career in a season. DeRozan is adapting to the Spurs' defensive system and has collected most of his nine steals by stepping into passing lanes. ""It's got nothing to with me or what I'm doing,"" Popovich said. ""He's a good basketball player. He's been an All-Star for I don't know how many years. He does all those things. He's a very good player."" BUSY NIGHT Rudy Gay missed his first game of the season, sitting out due to right heel soreness. Popovich downplayed the severity of the injury by saying Gay was sitting out because ""he has other things to do.""","401070817"
"PHOENIX --  The Phoenix Suns were locked in their tightest game of the season, and Devin Booker made good on his chance to get his struggling team a much-needed win. Booker's 17-foot jumper with 1.7 seconds left capped a fourth-quarter comeback by Phoenix, and the Suns snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 102-100 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday night. Booker, playing the entire fourth quarter with five fouls, scored 14 of his game high 25 points in the final period as Phoenix rallied from 12 points down for their second victory of the season. Trevor Ariza added 16 points and nine rebounds, and rookie Mikal Bridges scored nine of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. ""We've been stressing that if we get a win, it will change the energy around here,"" Booker said. ""Hopefully, this win will give us some new life."" Shelvin Mack's season-high 21 points led the Grizzlies, who got one more possession after Booker's big bucket. But Mike Conley missed a long 3-pointer at the horn. ""They did a good job just switching out. That was kind of tough with one second left,"" Mack said of Conley's shot. ""Coaches drew the play up and he had a chance to make it ... it just didn't go in tonight."" Dillon Brooks scored a season-high 17 points for Memphis, including eight in the fourth quarter. Brooks' layup with 8:39 to play gave the Grizzlies a 91-79 lead. The Suns chipped away until finally taking the lead. ""We didn't get enough easy shots towards the end,"" Brooks said. ""We weren't moving the ball, driving and attacking. We got a little stagnant."" The leading scorers for both teams were saddled with foul trouble. Conley picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter, and Booker was whistled for his fifth midway through the third quarter. Isaiah Canaan hit a 3 that gave Phoenix a 61-56 lead in the third period, the Suns' largest lead of the game. The Grizzlies responded with an 18-2 run and took a 74-63 lead. The Suns went almost four minutes without a point in the quarter. Phoenix cut the Grizzlies' lead to 81-77 at the end of the third, thanks to Jamal Crawford's 33-foot heave that swished through the net. Marshon Brooks followed his own missed free throw and gave the Grizzlies a 10-point lead, 47-37, with 4:15 left in the second quarter. The Grizzlies' largest lead of the first half was 10 points. Booker knocked down his first 3 after four misses with 46.5 seconds left in the second, and followed that with a lob to Deandre Ayton with 2.9 seconds. The Suns trailed 56-52 at the break. ""It wasn't a perfect game by any means, but we needed this one,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We needed this one as a group, as a unit, for many, many reasons."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: The Grizzlies' three-game win streak came to an end. ... F Chandler Parsons missed his fifth straight game with right knee soreness. ... F Kyle Anderson scored a season high 10. Suns: A day after sending him to G League affiliate Northern Arizona, the Suns recalled G De'Anthony Melton in time for Sunday's game. ... Crawford played in his 1,270th game, and moved into a tie with John Havlicek for 29th in NBA history. ... The Suns won despite a season high 25 turnovers. MOVING ON The Suns and Tyson Chandler Sunday reached an agreement to buy out the veteran center's contract, and the team requested waivers on Chandler. Vice president of basketball operations James Jones said the move gives Chandler, who played 166 games over four seasons with Phoenix, the chance to pursue a new opportunity while allowing the Suns' younger players to continue to develop. ""Nothing but a great experience to coach him, ""Kokoskov said. OUCH! Ariza was inadvertently hit in the groin area on the last play of the first quarter by Conley, and the end result was Wayne Selden's 3 at the buzzer that counted and gave Memphis a 28-21 lead. Ariza doubled over in pain, but was on the court to start the second quarter.","401070818"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Life is good for the Portland Trail Blazers 10 games into the season. Jusuf Nurkic had 19 points and 12 rebounds and led the Trail Blazers to a 111-81 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. to improve to 7-3 on the season. ""When everything go well, it go well,"" Nurkic said after the win pushed the Blazers to 7-3. ""We came ready after back-to-back and a bad loss."" Blazers star guard Damian Lillard said the team's start likely has surprised some. ""To be sitting where we are now, I'm sure people didn't expect it,"" Lillard said. ""I think we're playing good basketball. We've been pretty consistent with the things that we need to do to win games and it's showing."" Meyers Leonard had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. Following a game Saturday in which their bench struggled against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Trail Blazers' reserves bounced back Sunday and outscored the Wolves subs 44-23. ""I was happy for Meyers,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of his reserve big man. ""Got a little chant going, that was fun. I thought in the first half he played very well."" Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 23 points for Minnesota. It was his fourth straight game scoring 20 points or more. But scoring was not the issue for the Wolves on Sunday, as the Blazers got plenty of points at the free-throw line. ""Defensively, the penetration really hurt us,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Portland, the league's best free-throw shooting team, took advantage of its free-throw attempts in the first two quarters for a 61-45 halftime lead. In the game, the Trail Blazers shot 28 for 32 from the line. The Blazers continued the onslaught in the third quarter, pushing their lead to as many as 28 points. For the second straight game, the Blazers struggled from beyond the arc (7 for 28), but it didn't matter against the Wolves. The timeout helped as Minnesota stormed back, even taking a brief two-point lead on a 3-pointer from rookie guard Josh Okogie. Portland, however, took control of the game on the strength of their subs. Towns already had his knees wrapped up before the 4th quarter even started, knowing his night was over. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: In each of last three seasons, Portland's CJ McCollum has averaged over 20 points per game. But despite a league-wide scoring boom, McCollum has actually seen his scoring average drop to 19 points. While McCollum is sacrificing some individual glory, the Blazers have a 7-3 record and entered Sunday with the third-ranked offense in the NBA. ""I think obviously having Evan (Turner) out there with them, playing more minutes with Damian (Lillard) affects how much the ball is in his hands. His numbers are probably down a little bit but not significantly,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of the adjustment for McCollum. ""The emphasis this year was, again, passing and incorporating the team more and less off the dribble. That's how we are playing right now. I think everybody was on the same page. Not just talking to him but to everybody."" Timberwolves: Disgruntled Wolves forward Jimmy Butler sat out of Sunday night's game in Portland, due to what the team deemed ""precautionary rest."" Butler did not play in the Wolves game Wednesday, but did play Friday at Golden State Thibodeau did confirm to reporters before the game that Butler was with the team, clearly trying to downplay Butler's absence in light of the star forward's trade request. The Wolves were also without point guard Derrick Rose on Sunday, who was a late-scratch after being deemed a game-time decision by his coach.","401070819"
"LOS ANGELES --  Serge Ibaka outscored the Lakers by himself in the first quarter, and he didn't miss a shot until the third. He beat LA inside and outside on the way to the biggest offensive game of his career. Thanks to Ibaka's brilliance for the Toronto Raptors, Kawhi Leonard wasn't missed by anyone except the Lakers fans who might have been hoping to entice him home. Ibaka made his first 14 shots on the way to a career-high 34 points, and the Raptors didn't need an injured Leonard in a 121-107 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday night. Ibaka had 10 rebounds and didn't miss a shot until 5:16 remained in the third quarter, finishing 15 of 17. He was overpowering while the Raptors jumped to a stunning 31-point lead in the first quarter, and he returned in the final minutes to close out Toronto's eighth consecutive win over the Lakers. ""I was just focused,"" Ibaka said. ""I knew Kawhi was out tonight, so I just wanted to go out there and do my best."" With the Lakers' small lineups struggling to contain Ibaka early on, he became the first player to start a game 14 of 14 from the field since Shaquille O'Neal did it in February 2006, according to the NBA. ""That's pretty cool,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""The best thing is he's doing it with some real good composure. He's getting in there and taking his time. He's using his size, his power, and using pretty good footwork, so it's something we can go to."" Kyle Lowry added 21 points and 15 assists for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who haven't lost to the Lakers since 2014. ""We really wanted to put some pressure on them and guard the ball,"" Nurse said. ""We got off to an unbelievable start. We looked athletic and fast all over the place tonight."" Toronto didn't let its huge lead dwindle significantly until the final minutes, when the Lakers' youngster got the margin down to 117-107 with LeBron James on the bench. Toronto was forced to re-insert its starters in the final minutes to preserve the win. ""They've been playing like they're the best team in the Eastern Conference so far,"" said James, who finished with 18 points and six assists. ""They just came out and hit us right in the mouth, and it's going to be very hard to make a game of that when you're trying to expend so much energy to get back into it."" Kyle Kuzma scored 24 points and Brandon Ingram added 16 for the Lakers, who are 4-6 after their first 10 games with James after this defeat on the tail end of a back-to-back set that began with a gritty win in Portland on Saturday night. ""In my experience, unfortunately, most of the time when a player like Kawhi sits out, that team ends up winning,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""There's a sense of freedom and joy that comes when a top player like that is out. We tried to explain that that's part of how this works, but it doesn't seem like we took that to heart."" TIP-INS Raptors: Leonard has sat out three of his first 10 games with Toronto, missing two games last month to manage his workload coming back from last season's injury struggles. He injured his foot late in the Raps' win at Phoenix on Friday night. Nurse doesn't know whether Leonard will play Monday at Utah. ... OG Anunoby took Leonard's spot in the starting lineup and contributed seven points.

The Lakers would love to sign a second superstar like Leonard, who grew up in the Inland Empire area, one hour east of Los Angeles. BAD START The Lakers' first quarter was shockingly bad. Toronto took a 41-10 lead with 2:21 still remaining in the first quarter, and Ibaka outscored the Lakers 20-17 in the opening period. Ibaka went 11 for 11 in the first half, while Lowry had 12 assists as the Raptors hit six 3-pointers and forced nine turnovers.","401070820"
"DETROIT --  Minus their big man, the Miami Heat were looking for someone to come up big. Josh Richardson answered the call. The 6-foot-6 shooting guard scored 27 points to lead the short-handed Heat past the Detroit Pistons 120-115 in overtime Monday night. Richardson hit four free throws in the final 2.1 seconds to clinch it, ending Miami's three-game skid. Detroit has dropped five in a row. ""I was just being aggressive,"" Richardson said. ""I think I had a little lull in the fourth. I was just trying to get back and help us win. I was just taking my shots."" The Heat played without center Hassan Whiteside, who is second in the NBA in rebounding (14.6 per game) and blocked shots (2.75). Whiteside missed the game with an injured right knee. Richardson had nine of Miami's 15 points in overtime. It's the third time in four games he's put up at least 25, and the Heat can sense the fourth-year player growing into a role as their go-to scorer. ""It's the first time he's been called on to do this,"" Miami guard Dwyane Wade said. ""The shots he was taking in overtime and making, those were big-time shots. We want him to have the confidence to continue to take it to the next level, because we're going to need it."" Richardson sought to downplay his success, both on this night and in the bigger picture. ""There's not really a defined go-to guy on our team,"" he said. ""Anybody on our team can hurt you late. ""If I get the ball, it happens to find me late, if guys give me the ball, I'll definitely take that on. But I think we have a lot of guys who are very confident."" Kelly Olynyk, filling Whiteside's spot on the floor, scored 10 of his 13 points in the second half. Goran Dragic had 21 points and Wade, playing his farewell NBA season, contributed 18 off the bench. Andre Drummond had 25 points for Detroit, and the NBA rebounding leader pulled down 24 boards. It was a putback by Drummond with 0.5 seconds left on the clock that sent the game to overtime. ""Drummond was tremendous on the glass,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Every time we had a stop, or had bodies in front of the ball, he just has an incredible knack of second and third efforts. ""For a guy his size, the touch that he has to tip the ball in is pretty remarkable."" Reggie Jackson scored 25 and Langston Galloway added 21 off the bench. Blake Griffin, second in the league in scoring, had 24 points before fouling out in the fourth quarter. ""It is on us to continue to improve,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I know it's not showing in the record, but I do see improvement."" WADE A MINUTE So often a Detroit nemesis during his career, Wade was booed by Pistons fans who mocked him with chants of ""MVP!"" after he missed a free throw in the final minute of the first half. Wade, who has never won the NBA MVP award, responded to the taunting with a thunderous slam that tied the score at 51, one of three dunks he had in the game. ""I went to hot yoga this morning,"" Wade said. ""I think it was the yoga."" After the game, a throng of fans holding Wade's No. 3 Heat jersey awaited him as he left the court. ""I definitely have always got a lot of love and respect here,"" Wade said. ""I got some boos and some other words here, too. That's just the game of basketball.""

"INDIANAPOLIS --  James Harden produced his typical scoring flurry Monday night. His teammates delivered the knockout blow with a staunch second-half defensive effort. On a night the league's reigning MVP made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 36.1 seconds left and closed it out by making four straight free throws, Harden was thrilled to see the Houston Rockets rediscover their winning combination in a 98-94 victory at Indiana. ""We're doing a really good job of getting stops and making it hard for teams to score,"" he said. ""I'm not worried about our offense. We're a really good offensive team. We're going to make shots. We need a pretty good defensive effort (each night)."" The message seems to have sunk in. While Harden did his usual work with 28 points, six assists and five 3-pointers, the improving defense and a healthier roster has helped last season's Western Conference runner-ups punch their way out of an early-season corner. Since starting 1-5, Houston has won three straight -- all on the road, the last two without the benefit of hitting 100 points. And more help appears to be on the way. Officially, the Rockets say they are finalizing the details on a deal to bring back defensive guru Jeff Bzdelik. Unofficially, it looks all but done. ""Just really happy he's coming back,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game. ""It's great. We can pick up where we left off."" What Bzdelik will find is a team ready and willing to fight hard as it did again Monday. After trailing for most of the second and third quarters, they finally rallied behind Harden in the fourth quarter and closed it out by shutting down the Pacers. Victor Oladipo finished with 28 points and made two 3s in the final minute to trim the deficit to 94-93 with 24.7 seconds to go, but the Rockets didn't give up another basket as the Pacers' three-game winning streak ended. ""We still gave ourselves a chance to win, we just came up short,"" Oladipo said. ""The beauty of it is there is another game on Wednesday."" The Rockets have won three straight in the series though this one required everything they could muster. When P.J. Tucker and Carmelo Anthony knocked down back-to-back 3s midway through the fourth quarter, the Rockets were finally tied at 81. Chris Paul broke the tie with a layup and Harden added a free throw when Pacers coach Nate McMillan was called for a technical foul. Indiana spent the rest of the 's 3-pointer rattled in with 7:28 left and Carmelo Anthony followed Tucker's basket with another 3, the Rockets tied it at 81. Chris Paul broke the tie with a layup and Harden made a free throw after Pacers coach Nate McMillan drew a technical foul with 4:38 to go. Oladipo tied the score at 90 with the first of his two threes in the final minute, but Harden broke the tie with the last of his 3s, Paul made 1 of 2 free throw to make it 94-90 and Harden closed it out at the free-throw line. ""It was just a good, spirited win,"" D'Antoni said. ""Those are the ones, until we iron some stuff out, we have to (win), and we haven't been doing that."" TIP-INS Rockets: Clint Capela had 18 points and 10 rebounds for his sixth consecutive double-double, a career best. ... Paul took only three shots in a scoreless first half and wound up with nine points and 13 assists. ...... The Rockets were 15 of 47 on 3s and improved to 4-0 this season when outrebounding opponents.

Bojan Bogdanovic and Tyreke Evans scored 11 points. Thaddeus Young finished with eight points and 11 rebounds. IN SYNC McMillan is still working to get his offense get in sync. He would like to see better ball movement and a quicker tempo, both facets that could have helped against the Rockets. But he wasn't trying to take a cue from their usually high-scoring opponent. ""We don't want to just get into a run-and-gun game and make it a shootout,"" McMillan said. ""If we have something early (in the possession), we'll take it. If not we want to make them defend it.""","401070822"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Evan Fournier has struggled with his jump shot early this season. He got a big one to go down Monday night, though. The seventh-year swingman hit a 22-footer at the final horn and the Orlando Magic came back from a five-point deficit in the last 24 seconds, taking advantage of a late collapse by Cleveland in a 102-100 victory over the scuffling Cavaliers. Fournier took an inbounds pass with 1.8 seconds left after Nikola Vucevic blocked George Hill's shot at the other end, and the ball went out of bounds off Hill. ""I finished well shooting the ball, but I missed so many open shots in the first half and third quarter, it's amazing,"" Fournier said. ""I knew (the last shot) wasn't going to be catch-and-shoot situation because that's a tough shot. ... I knew I had time to dribble."" J.R. Smith's 3-pointer with 41.9 seconds remaining had given the Cavaliers a 100-95 lead until Aaron Gordon scored after an offensive rebound for the Magic with 23.8 seconds to go. D.J. Augustin made a steal and two free throws with 18.7 seconds left to trim the deficit to one. Kyle Korver then lost the ball to Fournier, who hit one of two free throws with 13 seconds on the clock to tie it at 100. ""We had to steal the ball, execute, and really win a game you're not supposed to when you're down whatever with 15 seconds left,"" Fournier said. ""Most of the time you don't win those games."" Gordon scored 23 points for Orlando, while Fournier and Terrence Ross had 15 each. Fournier added three steals, including that critical one in the final seconds while the Cavaliers were trying to protect a one-point lead. Hill scored 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and made 10 of 12 shots for Cleveland (1-9), which remained winless on the road. Tristan Thompson added 19 points and 16 rebounds. ""It was real tough, but the good part about it is the way we competed,"" said Smith, who had 14 points. ""Mistakes were made, but to see the way we played together defensively and executing on offense was inspiring to watch."" Vucevic scored the final six points of the first half, including a putback with 1.4 seconds left, to leave Orlando (4-6) with a 58-47 halftime lead -- the largest of the game for either team. Cleveland answered with 11 straight points early in the third quarter and pulled ahead 71-68 on a 3-pointer by Hill. Hill and Smith combined for nine points and Jordan Clarkson converted a four-point play as the Cavaliers finished the period on a 15-2 run to lead 79-70. But they didn't finish it. In the last 20 seconds they had two turnovers, and their only shot was blocked. ""We put ourselves in a great situation and we just did not execute down the stretch,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""When situations come up like that, you have to know what to do and execute. We didn't handle it and that is why we lost the game."" JOB REPORT Drew, promoted to head coach when the Cavaliers fired Tyronn Lue on Oct. 25, reached an agreement to remain the head coach for the rest of the season.

But, his foul sent a driving LaVine to the line for the winning free throw. ""I love the attack on that last possession to get to the free-throw line, which was obviously needed,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg. ""Our guys needed to get a close one. The guys hung tough and they stuck together. We found a way to get it.""

The Thunder led 84-77 when he left the game with 4:25 left in the third quarter. There was limited information on Westbrook's status after the game. ""We'll see,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Generally, with those things, we'll see how he does in the morning. But it's a sprained ankle. Hopefully, he'll be OK.""

"Kyrie Irving expresses his frustrations with Jamal Murray's last-second shot, saying the ball ""deserves to go into the crowd"" after a move like that. (0:50) DENVER --  Jamal Murray simply got caught up in the moment when he hoisted a long shot with the clock winding down. He took some heat for it. No disrespect meant, he maintained. Murray scored a career-high 48 points, including 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Denver Nuggets overcame a sluggish start to beat the Boston Celtics 115-107 on Monday night. The point guard knew he was on from his first jumper -- a deep 3-pointer. He realized he might have ruffled some feathers with his last -- an even deeper 3 in an effort to score 50. ""My emotion took over as it normally does when I get going like that,"" Murray explained. Murray was feeling it all night, hitting 19 of 30 shots, including five 3s. He had two attempts to reach 50 points in the final seconds, but missed a reverse layup and then that 3 at the buzzer -- one that bothered the Celtics with the game already decided. ""What kind of competitor wouldn't it bother? I was (mad), but we're not going to make a big thing about it,"" said Kyrie Irving, who scored 31 points on 13-of-17 shooting. ""But congratulations to him on 48 points. He did it in a great fashion."" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said the veterans on his team talked to Murray about the late shot. ""He's young. He's still learning,"" Malone said. ""You never want to try to disrespect anybody. It wasn't disrespect. He was trying to get to 50 points."" At 9-1, the Nuggets are earning a measure of respect around the NBA as they're off to their best start since 1976-77. They're 6-0 at home, including wins over Golden State and now Boston. ""We've accomplished nothing,"" Murray said. ""Keep trusting each other and get the job done."" Denver spotted the Celtics an 18-point lead in the first quarter but quickly made up ground behind Murray, who scored 23 in the first half. In a matchup between two of the league's top defenses, it was offense that ruled on this night. More specifically, Murray. He took over the game in the fourth quarter, hitting a pair of 3-pointers to give the Nuggets some breathing room. The Celtics even tried to double-team him. It didn't work. ""He was rolling,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He got a couple of easy ones out of the gate that I think made him feel good. He deserves credit."" The Nuggets needed a big game from Murray because the Celtics found some rhythm. Malone knew it was just a matter of time before a streaky Boston offense started consistently knocking down jumpers. He was just hoping it would happen after Monday. ""Their offense is trending in the right direction,"" Malone said. ""Couple that with their defense, which can be suffocating at times, and that's what makes them such a dangerous team -- a team that's going to go very, very deep in the playoffs.""

""I can't say enough great things about him and all the things that he has meant to the Celtics, Celtic fans in and around New England and even in our house,"" Stevens said. ""He's an absolute pleasure to be around."" Thomas isn't expected back until possibly next month, but he's already having an influence on the Nuggets -- with his voice. ""We have a relatively quiet group and one thing that everybody knows that's been around Isaiah is that he's not quiet,"" Malone said. ""He brings an energy and a voice and a leadership that we sorely miss."" LESSON LEARNED Morris believes Murray learned his lesson about shooting with a game in hand. ""I know him personally. It was unprofessional,"" Morris said. ""He's a young player. He'll learn.""","401070826"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Without Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors used a balanced team effort to get their fourth straight win. ""We have been playing basically position-less basketball,"" said Kyle Lowry, who had 17 points and 11 assists to lead four Raptors with 17 points as Toronto beat the Utah Jazz 124-111 on Monday night. Serge Ibaka, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet also had 17 points as the Raptors were bolstered with six players in double figures to win their fourth straight game. ""Tonight was how our offense is supposed to be played,"" VanVleet said. ""As long as we're making shots, their defense has to respect the shooters and it allows us to play with more freedom out there."" The matchup lost some luster -- and nearly 49 points a game -- when Utah's Donovan Mitchell was ruled out with a left ankle sprain and Toronto's Leonard sat with a sore left ankle as well. But the Raptors didn't miss a beat and their offensive spacing left the court wide-open for drives. ""Nobody likes to play in tight spaces, in congested spaces, so with an offense full of shooters, it's open and it's fun out there,"" VanVleet said. Ibaka made all eight of his shots and has made 27 of his last 29 attempts. ""The guy is hot,"" Lowry said of Ibaka but he could have said it about a half-dozen Raptors. The point guard is certainly finding his shooters and has now posted nine consecutive games with 10 or more assists. Alec Burks led Utah with 22 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 12 rebounds. After the game, Burks was so disgusted he said he had nothing to say to the media despite his scoring outburst. The Raptors broke the game open with a 15-3 run that bridged the second and third quarter. The spurt was capped when Danny Green hit a 3-pointer to make it 71-55 for Toronto, which stretched the lead to as many as 26 early in the final period. The last time the Jazz lost four in a row at home was in the 2013-14 season when they went 25-57. ""The little things that made us so good last year -- we haven't really done any of them to this point,"" Joe Ingles said. The Jazz got to the basket time and again but couldn't finish as the Raptors challenged them at the 3-point arc. Utah shot 8-of-31 from 3-point range, but that was skewed by the Jazz making three 3s in garbage time. Despite a 21-5 deficit in free throw attempts in the first half, the Raptors made eight 3s and shot 63 percent from the field to lead 65-54 at the break. HOME COOKING? The Jazz haven't started 0-4 at home since their inaugural season in New Orleans in 1974-75. That season, the Jazz played in the Municipal Auditorium, and lost their first six home games before finally beating Portland behind Pete Maravich's 30 points. COACH SEAT Rick Pitino, who was fired in 2017 as Louisville's head coach, took in the game from a courtside seat within earshot of Utah coach Quin Synder. Pitino, who coached Mitchell at Louisville, was accompanied by Utah Valley University coach Mark Pope who was on his 1996 Kentucky NCAA Championship team. TIP-INS Raptors: Norman Powell left the game with a sprained shoulder and went straight to the locker room with 9:46 left in the second quarter. He did not return and will be evaluated on Tuesday. ... Lowry, after multiple spirited conversations with the officials, got a technical late in the third quarter. ... The Raptors outscored the jazz by 29 points in the 29 minutes Lowry was on the court. Jazz: Ingles dislocated his finger with 6:17 left in the game and did not return. ... Utah went 27-for-41 from the line while Toronto made 13 of their 14 attempts. ... Ricky Rubio had nine assists but shot 1-for-10.","401070827"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Golden State Warriors delivered one of those high-flying third quarters that were a signature last season. Stephen Curry capped it with a rare but dazzling block. ""We'll have to start calling him a rim protector now,"" Kevin Durant quipped. Klay Thompson scored 27 points, Durant added 22 points, six rebounds and six assists, and the Warriors pulled away after halftime to run their winning streak to eight games with a 117-101 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. Curry overcame a slow start to score 19 points, and the Warriors used a 34-15 third quarter to pull away. That marked a season-low scoring total for any quarter by the Grizzlies. At 10-1, the Warriors are off to the second-best start in franchise history behind the team of three years ago that began 24-0. The 1960-61 Philadelphia Warriors were 9-0 before losing four straight. Thompson's contested 3 moments before the halftime buzzer sent the teams into intermission tied at 58, then the Warriors took off the way they do resemblant of their signature third quarters last season. ""I think the second half we picked the pace up, got out in transition and that opens up the floor for everybody,"" Thompson said. Curry's 3-pointer with 3:14 left in the third put the Warriors up by 10, 81-71, before Durant followed with back-to-back jumpers. Curry swatted a shot by Wayne Selden to end the third, sending the two-time defending champions into a frenzy. ""That was impressive,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""I was hoping for the (Dikembe) Mutombo finger wag. Didn't quite get it."" Curry shot 1 of 7 in the opening quarter with a single 3 accounting for his point total. Draymond Green was limited to just fewer than 14 minutes because of a bruised right foot. X-rays were negative, Kerr said. Dillon Brooks came off the bench to score 11 of his 18 points in the first quarter to help the Grizzlies take a 31-29 lead. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Shelvin Mack scored 15 apiece for Memphis. Marc Gasol had eight points with just a pair of field goals to go with 10 rebounds and nine assists for Memphis in its first set of 13 back-to-backs this season. Alfonzo McKinnie scored 14 points off the bench for the Warriors, who have won 13 of the last 17 meetings with Memphis and four straight at home. ""It's a snowball effect of things,"" Memphis guard Mike Conley said. ""When they get a couple good looks, a couple easy shots to fall, it's contagious and everybody else kind of feeds off it."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis shot 45.8 percent. The Grizzlies came into the game shooting 53 percent at home to just 40.2 away, but had gone 49 percent from the floor in two games to begin this current road trip at Utah and Phoenix. ... F Ivan Rabb scored four points over nine minutes in his return home to the East Bay where he attended Bishop O'Dowd High and the University of California. ... The Grizzlies have committed fewer turnovers than opponents in each of their initial nine games. ... Memphis last won at Oracle 128-119 in overtime on Jan. 6, 2017. Warriors: Curry had his fourth block of the season and No. 133 of his career. ... G Shaun Livingston missed his fifth straight game and seventh in the last nine with a sore right foot, while fellow key reserve Andre Iguodala was out for rest. ... Coming off a game they outrebounded the Timberwolves 61-39, Golden State held another lopsided advantage on the glass: 46-30. CASSPI'S CONTRIBUTIONS Omri Casspi missed the game against his old team because of a sore right knee but received his championship ring from Warriors general manager Bob Myers during a pregame ceremony for his contributions with the two-time defending champions during the regular season. He wasn't on the playoff roster. ""I'm really thankful for the class act by the Warriors,"" Casspi said. ""We all know how grateful I am for that. I'm happy to be a part of that, I'm happy to be a part of the team that won the championship. Obviously I missed the playoffs. I wanted to be there so bad. It's natural."" Even though he was waived by Golden State ahead of the start of the postseason to make roster room for guard Quinn Cook, Casspi played a key role and the Warriors honored him with a video tribute. ""Just difficult circumstances that led to all of that, but he was very professional the way he handled it and he played very well for us in the regular season when he was healthy,"" Kerr said. He appeared in 53 games with seven starts averaging 14 minutes during his one season with the Warriors. Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff credited Golden State for the thoughtful gesture. ""Hats off to this organization and the class that they walk with,"" he said.","401070828"
"LOS ANGELES --  Tobias Harris scored 22 points, Lou Williams added 20 and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated Minnesota 120-109 Monday night, dropping the Timberwolves to 0-6 on the road this season. Led by Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose, the Wolves rallied in the fourth quarter when the duo combined to score 22 of the team's 25 points. Rose finished with 21 points and Butler had 16 of his 20 in the final period. Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Wolves. After resting Sunday in Portland, Butler scored Minnesota's first nine points of the fourth, twice getting the Timberwolves within one. The Clippers answered both times, with Williams hitting a basket and Montrezl Harrell scoring consecutive buckets for a 98-93 lead. Danilo Gallinari added 22 points for the Clippers, making all six of his free throws. Williams hit all five of his foul shots. Things got chippy twice in the fourth. Milos Teodosic was closely guarding Rose as he brought the ball up court and got called for a foul. Harrell ran up and started jawing at Rose. A few minutes later, Taj Gibson tripped over a sprawled Patrick Beverley on a rebound and Harrell knocked down Rose on a drive and got called for a foul on the other end. Security briefly came on the floor, and the play away from the ball was reviewed. Gibson received a technical foul. The Clippers built an 11-point lead early in the third when Beverley came off the bench to hit a 3-pointer and make another basket. Helped by four straight points from Rose and a 3 by Andrew Wiggins, the Wolves trailed 92-84 heading into the fourth. The teams played a tight first half, when they both shot 51 percent from the floor and neither led by more than six points. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Fell to 0-3 on their West Coast trip with two games remaining. ... All five starters finished in double figures. ... Rose started after sitting out Sunday with a sore left ankle. Clippers: Snapped a six-game skid against the Timberwolves, ending their longest active losing streak against one opponent.","401070829"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  A fourth-quarter surge helped Charlotte complete a successful homestand. Still, coach James Borrego and All-Star guard Kemba Walker know the Hornets need to play better if they want to improve on their 6-5 start. Walker had 29 points and seven assists as Charlotte beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-102 on Tuesday night. Marvin Williams added 20 points for the Hornets, who finished a 3-1 homestand. ""I give Atlanta a lot of credit,"" Borrego said. ""They really guarded us tonight. They're very active with their shifts. We were real stagnant and we didn't have a great rhythm offensively until the fourth quarter."" That's when Walker and Williams spurred a 19-4 spurt that allowed the Hornets to pull away from the Hawks (3-7). ""A win is a win,"" Walker said. ""We were a little sloppy early on. But we adjusted and made plays down the stretch and came out with a win."" Walker was critical of his five turnovers on a night when Charlotte committed 21 overall. ""They're pretty good defensively,"" Walker said. ""They're active and they disrupted us early. We have to do a better job of adjusting, especially me."" Walker and Williams scored 12 points apiece in the second half as Charlotte erased a 54-51 halftime deficit. Walker has scored 25 or more seven times in 11 games. Jeremy Lamb and Malik Monk each had 13 points for the Hornets. Nic Batum scored 10. Playing against his former team, Jeremy Lin had 19 points off the bench to pace the Hawks, who led by seven late in the first half. Atlanta started 2018 first-round draft picks Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and Omari Spellman for the first time and pushed Charlotte before losing for the eighth time in the last nine meetings. Young finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Kent Bazemore added 16 points. Even after falling behind 81-77 entering the fourth quarter, the Hawks forged an 84-83 advantage with 10:04 to play before the Hornets took over down the stretch. Charlotte eventually led by as many as 15. ""Coming out of halftime, we just couldn't buy a basket,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We had a couple of opportunities where I thought we could have got a bigger lead and extended. We had that opportunity. We just never created any separation. I thought that was the difference in the game."" Neither team led by more than seven until the fourth quarter. Even though he scored 18 points, Young was disappointed with his shooting. ""I can't go 0 for 7 from the 3-point line and expect to call that playing well,"" said Young, the No. 5 pick in the draft out of Oklahoma. ""My teammates did a great job of playing hard and making plays. But we just couldn't hit enough shots in the second half."" TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce considers Walker one of the NBA's top players. ""I'm a huge fan of Kemba. I've known Kemba for a long time. You're seeing a confident and elite scorer,"" Pierce said. He first met Walker at Nike Elite camps years ago, and in August 2017 was a part of the NBA Africa trip with the Hornets' two-time All-Star guard. Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist dislocated his right pinkie in the first half but returned to play in the second. ... Borrego thinks the 20-year-old Young can thrive as a pro. ""He fits today's NBA for sure. The minute he crosses halfcourt, he's a threat. He's a guy that can play-make, get to the rim, pass, finish, shoot the ball. The Hawks have a very good point guard for years to come,"" Borrego said.","401070830"
"DALLAS --  The Mavericks have had the Washington Wizards' number in recent years, and Dallas' young backcourt ensured that remained the case Tuesday night. Luka Doncic scored 23 points and Dennis Smith Jr. made three key plays down the stretch as the Mavericks ended a six-game losing streak by beating Washington 119-100. It was the Mavericks' 16th win in their last 17 meetings with the Wizards. In the first half, when Dallas built a 24-point lead, it looked like a foregone conclusion. The Wizards climbed back within six midway through the fourth quarter, but Smith scooted past Dwight Howard to grab an offensive rebound and fed a cutting DeAndre Jordan for a dunk that put the Mavs up 101-93 with 5:33 left. Just 30 seconds later, the pair collaborated again on a pretty alley-oop, then Smith stole the ball from Bradley Beal near half-court and got it to Harrison Barnes for a three-point play and a 13-point lead. ""This is where you've got to trust your players,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Dennis has earned the trust. He's seeing things, and those plays were real pivotal plays in the game and it kept them at a distance."" Smith finished with 19 points and seven assists. Wesley Matthews added 22 points for Dallas, and Barnes had 19 points and 13 rebounds. John Wall led the Wizards with 24 points. Otto Porter Jr. and Beal had 19 each, but Beal was 1 for 9 on 3-point attempts. Washington was just 11 for 35 on 3s. ""We just didn't make shots and we didn't communicate well in transition,"" Wall said. ""In the third quarter, we did a better job of playing with intensity. I just feel like maybe eight, 10 wide-open 3s, we just missed and still had a chance down six in the fourth quarter with five minutes to go."" Doncic scored 13 in the first half, including a rainbow 3 just before the halftime buzzer to put Dallas up 70-49. It was the Mavs' highest first-half output of the young season. Washington started the third quarter strong, with Beal scoring seven points in a 12-4 run to pull within 13. Porter had three 3s in the quarter, the last in the final seconds to bring the Wizards within single digits for the first time since the first period. THREE FEELS GOOD While Dallas is just 3-7, the Mavericks won their third game considerably sooner than the previous two seasons -- they started 2-14 last year and 2-13 in 2016-17. BACK IN FORM Barnes delivered his first double-double of the season in a strong performance after missing the first four games of the year due to a right hamstring strain. Barnes credits having played with great players at Golden State before coming to Dallas and now having a role model in teammate Dirk Nowitzki. ""The biggest thing I've learned from them is to do it by example every single day,"" Barnes said. ""To come in, to put the work in, and let that speak for itself."" TIP-INS Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks reminisced about Dallas counterpart Rick Carlisle, his roommate in the CBA in 1987. ""He doesn't get a lot of credit for being a great player,"" Brooks said. When pressed by skeptical reporters about his claim, Brooks drew laughter by arguing that he would recognize greatness because: ""I WAS a great player. I was better than a lot of guys that you're asking me about and a lot of guys that tried to make it,"" he said. Mavericks: Devin Harris missed his ninth straight game with a left hamstring strain. Carlisle said Harris wouldn't play before the weekend at the earliest. ... Jordan had 12 rebounds and has been in double digits in all 10 games with the Mavs. ... Dallas made 26 of 27 free throws, with nine players making at least one.","401070831"
"PHOENIX --  Phoenix was the perfect place for the improving Brooklyn Nets to start a four-game trip, with the two top teams in the West still to come in Denver and Golden State. The Nets beat the struggling Suns 104-82 Tuesday night and are 6-1 in Arizona since moving from New Jersey to Brooklyn in 2012. Caris LeVert scored 26 points, D'Angelo Russell added 15 and the Nets won their third game in the past four, while the Suns have lost eight of nine. Devin Booker led Phoenix with 20 points but made just 6 of 21 shots. Deandre Ayton had 15 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. ""We just tried to make every shot tough, every catch tough,"" LeVert said. ""We did a good job of that."" Brooklyn held the Suns to a season low in points and field goal shooting at 34.6 percent. ""We're growing up in terms of our physicality on the defensive end,"" Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Suns went on a 9-0 run to turn a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to 63-58 difference on Trevor Ariza's corner 3 with 5:31 to play. The Nets regained a 14-point lead, 74-60, with Spencer Dinwiddie's 3 at the 2:18 mark. ""Not to look forward, but you look at the schedule and you know who you have next and this one is definitely a winnable game,"" Nets center Ed Davis said. ""It's a game we definitely needed to win and handled business."" Phoenix never threatened in the fourth, the Suns' cold shooting helping the Nets remain in control. Davis' dunk made it 92-74 with 4:15 to play. The Nets' strategy seemed to be to let the 7-foot-1 Ayton shoot mid-range shots rather than allow him to work inside the paint. It worked for much of the game, as the Suns' high-profile rookie made just 6 of 17 shots. Both teams struggled to hit shots in the first quarter, with field goal percentages of less than 40 both ways. The Nets, up two after one quarter, led by 14 during the second quarter. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson's short turnaround bank shot made it 47-34 with 2:53 to go before halftime. ""Energy, effort wasn't there, mind wasn't there,"" Suns head coach Igor Kokoskov said. Phoenix got back-to-back 3s from Mikal Bridges and Ariza to cut the lead to 50-42, and the Suns trailed by 10 at the half. Suns backup center Richaun Holmes had season highs of 13 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Nets: The Nets outscored the Suns 54-30 in points in the paint. ... G Jared Dudley returned to Phoenix for the first time since being traded in the offseason. He spent seven seasons over two stints with the Suns. ... F DeMarre Carroll has yet to play this season due to a right ankle injury. Suns: F T.J. Warren returned after missing the team's last game with back spasms. ... Booker entered the game second in the NBA with an average of 9.8 points per game in the fourth quarter. He had four in the final 12 minutes. ... G Jamal Crawford moved into 29th place career in games played (1,271). UNEXPECTED LETDOWN The Suns, coming off a 102-100 win over Memphis on Sunday, had hoped that win was the start of a turnaround. But it didn't happen, at least right away, and the home team heard the boos toward the end of the game. ""It sucks, man,"" Booker said. ""We thought last game would be our step forward and we definitely took a step back tonight. We got blown out in front of our fans, so it's embarrassing."" Kokoskov wasn't pleased with the performance. ""I know the fans love the Phoenix Suns, come here excited to watch these guys. They're not driving home happy,"" he said. DUDLEY DOING RIGHT Dudley, with 11 pro seasons to his credit, has started all 11 games for the Nets this season, and Atkinson said Dudley gets an ""A-plus"" for leadership. ""He's doing it in the locker room and he is also doing it with his play because he doesn't need the ball in his hands,"" Atkinson said. ""He's going to space the floor and he's an intelligent defender.""","401070832"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  In search of his jump shot, CJ McCollum watched every single 3-pointer he took last season looking for what he lost. Fortunately for the Portland Trail Blazers, he found it. McCollum scored 40 points and Portland beat Milwaukee 118-103 on Tuesday night to hand the Bucks their second loss in 10 games this season. ""Whether I play well or not, I know how much time I spend preparing,"" McCollum said. ""The only thing I saw was I had a lot of in-and-outs and I was shooting with a dead wrist. That was the only thing I noticed. I wasn't locking my wrist out, so I just tried to lock my wrist out."" The result was a dazzling performance against one of the NBA's best teams early this season. ""A lot of credit to CJ. He had a heck of a night,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Any time we made a bit of a run or felt like the momentum might be changing, McCollum hit a big shot."" McCollum, who entered shooting well below his career averages, went 17 for 26 from the field and added six assists. ""It was tough,"" Milwaukee big man Brook Lopez said. ""He made some huge plays and some tough shots that definitely were contested."" Evan Turner had 16 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for the Blazers (8-3). Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 23 points and nine rebounds. Lopez shot 6 for 10 from 3-point range and finished with 22 points. In the third quarter, McCollum put on a show. He scored 19 points and made Bucks rookie guard Donte DiVincenzo fall down on a crossover move before hitting a basket, sending the crowd into a frenzy. ""Welcome to the league,"" Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic said. ""It can be hard some nights. Put some ice and you'll be fine."" Portland led by 14 after three. Play began at a fast pace that carried on throughout in a meeting between two of the top five offenses in the NBA. With only 16 foul shots combined, the game took less than two hours. Portland outscored the Bucks 33-31 in the first quarter as both teams shot better than 50 percent from the floor and the 3-point line. TIP-INS Bucks: Now with Budenholzer in charge, Milwaukee is playing a much different style this season. After being a bottom-five team in 3-point attempts last season, the Bucks came in second in the NBA in 3-point tries with 41 per game. That included their 117-113 loss at Boston in which they put up 55 shots from beyond the arc. ""Yeah, it's a lot,"" Budenholzer said. ""The game is always evolving with teams, coaches and players trying to figure out what gives them the best chance. The skill of players now today is special, so trying to push that envelope."" Trail Blazers: One of the biggest changes for the Trail Blazers this season has been utilizing Turner as the primary ball-handler on their second unit. The results have led to one of the best bench units in the NBA so far, ranking ninth in scoring. ""The second unit comes in, their ball movement, their execution -- they're playing with each other,"" Budenholzer said. ""They take advantage if the defense overcommits or over-rotates. They're playing really well together. Evan Turner is kind of a great setup guy with that group. It's interesting to see how they've changed a little bit and how it's working for them.""","401070833"
"CLEVELAND --  Oklahoma City's big fourth-quarter lead was gone and Russell Westbrook was unavailable. The Thunder didn't panic and regrouped in the closing minutes to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 95-86 on Wednesday night. ""Thank God we were able to make a few more shots and get some late stops,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""I give our guys credit. We persevered and stayed with it. To get a win on the road is a good thing."" Dennis Schroder scored a season-high 28 points in replacing the injured Westbrook, who sprained his left ankle Monday. Oklahoma City won its sixth straight game without the two-time MVP after starting the season 0-4. Schroder, starting in Westbrook's place, was 11 for 19 from the field. Paul George scored 18 points and Jermai Grant had 12. ""We understand the NBA,"" George said. ""Runs are a part of the game. Every game is not going to be perfect."" Cleveland (1-10) rallied from an 11-point deficit early in the fourth  to go ahead. Oklahoma City led 78-67 before the Cavaliers went on a 13-0 run. J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver each hit two 3-pointers and the Cavaliers led 80-78 with 7:02 remaining. Alex Abrines' 3-point shot from the corner with 4:31 left broke an 84-84 tie and put Oklahoma City on top for good. Cleveland added two more players to its ever-growing injury list. Rookie point guard Collin Sexton made his first career start after George Hill was a late scratch because of a sore right shoulder. Sexton, taken with the eighth pick in the draft, scored a team-high 15 points in a career-high 42 minutes. He was told about 30 minutes before tipoff that he would be starting. ""I was ready, no surprise,"" he said. ""I didn't have any butterflies. You always have to be prepared that your chance is going to come."" Cedi Osman started in forward Kevin Love's spot, but left with back spasms in the first quarter and didn't return. Love had surgery on his left foot and is expected to be out for several weeks. Smith scored 13 points and Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson each had 11 for Cleveland. Oklahoma City scored 17 straight points over a period of 4:36 in the second and third quarters to take a 56-40 lead. The Thunder scored the last nine points of a lackluster first half to take a 48-40 lead. George made a basket and a free throw before ending the second quarter with a 29-foot 3-pointer as the buzzer. Schroder had a three-point play and a jumper and Grant hit a 3-pointer to help build the 16-point lead. Westbrook traveled with the team, but no timetable has been given for his return and he's unlikely to play Thursday against Houston. He's averaging 24.1 points, 8.9 assists and 8.3 rebounds in seven games. NICE FILL-IN Schroder didn't have an assist, but committed only two turnovers in 34 minutes. ""They overplayed me, so I tried to put pressure on the rim and score big-time,"" he said. ""They played smart and they switched every time, so me and Paul had to be aggressive at the rim."" INJURY UPDATES Cavaliers coach Larry Drew didn't learn of Osman's injury until the second-year player left the game. Hill hurt his shoulder late in Monday's loss in Orlando and couldn't get loose enough to play. ""They took Cedi in the back and came back and said he was done for the night,"" Drew said. ""I don't know the extent of the injury, we'll have to wait and see how he is. George was hurting this morning. He tried to participate in shoot-around. He didn't look good, he didn't look good at all. We elected to just sit him out tonight."" Hill had his best game of the season Monday with 22 points. TIP-INS Thunder: Donovan was hit with a technical as the first quarter ended. George complained about not getting a foul called when he drove to the basket earlier in the period and gave the officials a disgusted wave. ... The winning streak is the second-longest active streak in the NBA, trailing only Golden State (eight). Cavaliers: Drew juggled his starting lineup after power forward Sam Dekker sprained his left ankle Monday. Osman moved to Dekker's spot and Smith started at small forward, but that alignment didn't last long. Osman played only six minutes because of the injury. Center Ante Zizic had 10 points and nine rebounds in 17 minutes.","401070834"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Detroit center Andre Drummond has expanded his offensive game dramatically. Drummond had 23 points and 19 rebounds and the Pistons beat the Orlando Magic 103-96 on Wednesday night to snap a five-game losing streak. Drummond hit 10 of 16 shots, including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter, and nailed both free throw attempts. He scored 19 points in the first half, then set picks and chased down offensive rebounds for teammates in the final two periods. ""Andre was the player of the game for me,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""The way he competed, just playing hard. Not one play was called for him, but he's not worried about touches. He just goes out and plays his butt off and once we all get in our mind what the important things are to win in this league, we're going to be OK."" The Pistons were especially good at the end of each quarter and needed it to squeeze out a win. Detroit rallied from a 15-point first quarter and 11-point third quarter deficits to keep within tracking distance of the Magic. After allowing Orlando to pull to 94-93 with 2:58 left in the game, Detroit ran off nine straight points to seal their first win on this six-game trip. ""We've been struggling with finishing quarters, letting teams go on runs and it's been killing us,"" said reserve Langston Galloway, who had 12 points and six rebounds. ""For us to finish out those quarters was big."" Evan Fournier led Orlando with 27 points, D.J. Augustin had 16, Aaron Gordon 15 and Nikola Vucevic 14, but the Magic's bench was dismal. Terrence Ross had 15 points, but the rest of the reserves combined to shoot 1-for-14 with 11 turnovers between them. ""The starters were really good and the bench was ... whoa!"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""They were bad, I mean really, really bad, not competitive in either half. That makes it hard to win in this league. Guys have to be professional and be ready to play. The bench was embarrassing, that's it."" Fournier hit three straight shots and Aaron Gordon added a dunk to pull Orlando to 94-93 with 2:58 left. Griffin made a pair of free throws to start a 9-0 run for Detroit that Jackson finished with a 3-pointer and a layup. The Magic opened the third period with three straight 3-pointers and a 27-9 run to take a 78-67 lead, Detroit, as it did the first two periods, rallied in the final minute to get control. Griffin hit a 3-pointer and a layup and Ish Smith had a block and breakaway layup at the buzzer that made it 80-78, TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond has 19 or more rebounds in three of the last four games. ... Detroit has attempted a team-record 328 3-pointers in its first 10 games. ... The backups had a plus-82 rating in the game. Magic: The Magic started the fourth quarter 0 for 7 from the field and committed seven turnovers. ... Orlando got two four-point plays in the first half, one from Ross and another from Augustin. ... The Magic bench had a minus-110 rating. ISAAC CONCERNS Orlando hasn't seen much of a return on Jonathan Isaac, the sixth pick in the 2017 draft. Isaac missed 55 games his rookie year with ankle problems. He started the first eight Magic games this season, but missed the last three with another sprained ankle. He took some shots during practice Wednesday, is not expected to play for at least another week. ""It's important we handle this the right way so it's not one of those things where he plays two games and it's sore and he has to miss one,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Hopefully he'll feel 100 percent and then just play injury free or pain free the rest of the season.""","401070835"
"ATLANTA --  Tim Hardaway Jr. knows the New York Knicks are depending on him to take charge when necessary. Sometimes that's easier said than done. ""I can just remember from the Indiana game (last week) how many opportunities I had to take over and put my name on the game, and I didn't take advantage of that,"" he said. ""I just wanted to make sure that we did a good job of executing down the stretch and try to put the game in my hands and on my shoulders."" Hardaway scored 27 of his 34 points in the second half, reserve Enes Kanter added 17 points and 11 rebounds, and the Knicks beat the Atlanta Hawks 112-107 on Wednesday night. In a matchup of rebuilding clubs, Allonzo Trier finished with 16 points and Noah Vonleh had 11 points and 13 rebounds to help New York snap a two-game skid. Omari Spellman scored 18 points for the Hawks, who have lost two straight and six of seven. Alex Poythress' basket cut the lead to four with 22.8 seconds remaining, but the Hawks blew their next two possessions when Poythress dropped an inbound pass and Taurean Prince missed two free throws. Trae Young finished with 15 points and eight assists for Atlanta, but the NBA's fifth-overall draft pick missed 13 of 19 shots and went just 1 for 7 on 3-point attempts. ""We get down double digits in that third quarter, really from an inability to score,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""There are a lot of reasons. Out of sync. Trying to find the rhythm of the group. Someone to kind of give us life."" Hardaway, who had career highs of 16 free throws made and 20 attempted, forced his will in the third as one of the few veteran players on the floor. He was 5 for 8 from the field and had 15 points, two steals and one blocked shot. ""I was trying to get my rhythm back in the first half,"" he said. ""Then in the second half we started getting defensive stops, steals, blocks, getting back on defense. That kind of propelled me on the offensive end and kept me going."" The Knicks never trailed after Emmanuel Mudiay's 3 made it 65-63 midway through the third. They took their biggest lead at 16 on Kanter's two free throws in the final minute of the period. Kanter got tangled up with Hawks reserve center Miles Plumlee on a rebound attempt early in the fourth. He flipped over and landed on his head after both players fell to the floor. Kanter stayed in the game and shook off any bad vibes. ""We are having fun, especially all of the young guys,"" Kanter said. ""The chemistry is getting there, so we are just going to go there, smile, have fun and try to get a win."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kevin Knox, the No. 9 overall draft pick, was 0 for 6 from the field and did not score in nine minutes. It was his second game back after missing seven with a sprained left ankle. He had two points in five minutes of Monday's double-overtime loss to Chicago. ... Ntilikina, the eighth overall pick, is the only Knick to start the first 12 games. Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce said rookie F Kevin Huerter, the 19th overall pick, was not with the team because of a family matter. ... Young, Huerter and Spellman started at Charlotte, marking the first time since April 1, 2005 that the Hawks started three rookies. Josh Smith, Josh Childress and Royal Ivey were in the lineup that day against Boston. ON THE MEND An MRI last week showed the mild inflammation in his left ankle looks better, but Hawks F John Collins likely won't return to practice until next week. He has missed the first 11 games.","401070836"
"MIAMI --  Hassan Whiteside wants a recount. Even if that doesn't happen, he finally knows what it's like to beat San Antonio. Whiteside had 29 points, 20 rebounds and an NBA season-high nine blocked shots -- he thinks it was 10, and some of his teammates and coaches feel the same way. That was all the Miami Heat had to fret about Wednesday night, after they snapped a four-year drought against San Antonio by beating the Spurs 95-88. ""It would have been pretty cool for him to get that triple-double,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But the context of his winning plays had nothing to do with the stat line. When he brings that kind of intensity, competitiveness, the defensive efforts ... we're clearly a different team."" Spoelstra's postgame news conference was interrupted by a crasher -- Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who burst through a side door. ""That's baloney. Everything he just said is pure crap,"" Popovich said, before jumping onto the platform where Spoelstra was speaking and giving the Heat coach a hug. The coaches laughed, and Popovich then said ""go to hell"" before walking out. So everyone left happy. Whiteside just left happier than most, even without his triple-double. ""Whoever's got to review it, review it,"" Whiteside said. Many numbers were without dispute: The Spurs shot 33 percent, their lowest in a regular-season game since 2008, and connected on only 29 percent of their 2-point tries. ""We all have nights like these,"" said San Antonio's LaMarcus Aldridge, who had six points on 2-for-14 shooting. ""Hopefully they're few and far between."" Wayne Ellington scored 20 points and Justise Winslow added 16 for the Heat, who had dropped their last nine regular-season games to the Spurs -- and 11 consecutive games overall going back to the 2014 NBA Finals. ""We've got a lot of guys who are capable,"" Ellington said. ""Tonight was my night to get out there and be able to contribute."" Josh Richardson added 14 for the Heat, who were down to an eight-man rotation for the second half because of injuries and Dwyane Wade missing the game for personal reasons. Patty Mills scored 20 off the bench for San Antonio. Davis Bertans scored 19 and DeMar DeRozan added 18 for the Spurs, who had a 50-12 edge in bench scoring. The Spurs were down 19 in the fourth before rallying. Bryn Forbes had a chance to get San Antonio within two with about 30 seconds left, but his 3-pointer missed, Whiteside grabbed his 20th rebound and the Heat escaped. Whiteside had played against the Spurs five times previously, and the Heat lost all of them. He's now been part of at least one win against 29 NBA clubs -- with Miami the lone exception. ""I hope I never beat them,"" Whiteside said. TIP-INS Spurs: Derrick White (heel) made his season debut, started and was scoreless in 16 minutes. ... Down 15-4, the Spurs subbed all five starters out simultaneously just 4:22 into the game. ... San Antonio's 42 first-half points were a season-low. Heat: Richardson missed his first eight shots and finished 6 for 22. ... Ellington started and played 37 minutes after logging only 12 minutes in two appearances so far this season. He missed the start of the season with ankle soreness. EARLY RUN The Spurs led only twice, at 2-0 and 4-2. Miami had a 15-0 run in the opening minutes to take the lead, the biggest stretch of consecutive points against San Antonio so far this season. MANY MISSING Besides Wade, Miami was also without point guard Goran Dragic (right knee inflammation), Dion Waiters and James Johnson (recovering from surgeries), and Derrick Jones Jr. was ruled out at halftime with a bruised right knee. The Spurs were without Rudy Gay (right heel soreness), Pau Gasol (right foot soreness) and former Miami Hurricane standout Lonnie Walker IV (recovering from knee surgery). EIGHT WAS ENOUGH Whiteside had eight blocked shots in the first half. That was a Heat record for any half; the previous first-half mark was seven by Alonzo Mourning in 1999, and the second-half mark is seven by Whiteside -- twice, most recently in 2016.","401070837"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Philadelphia 76ers finally found a solution to their road woes Wednesday night. Start fast and finish strong. Joel Embiid scored 20 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and Ben Simmons flirted with a triple double, leading the 76ers past Indiana 100-94 for their first non-home court victory this season. ""I'm excited that we got our first road win this year,"" coach Brent Brown said. ""We were pleased to get a win, especially after a performance we wanted to forget (at Brooklyn)."" The splits coming into the game were astonishing. Despite going 6-0 at home, the 76ers were 0-5 on the road, losing by an average of 15.2 points. And they had lost eight straight at Indiana, dating to a victory on April 17, 2013. So just three nights after an inexplicable 25-point loss at Brooklyn, Embiid, Simmons and their teammates felt right at home in one of coach Brent Brown's favorite NBA arenas. Embiid collected his league-high 11th double-double on what he called an off night. Simmons had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists and Dario Saric scored a season-high 18 points by going 4 for 6 on 3-pointers. And they did it by simply sticking to the plan. They quickly jumped to a 19-9 lead, weathered Indiana's rally, then regained control by closing the third quarter on a 6-1 flurry and opened the fourth with a decisive 16-7 run. When it ended on Simmons' breakaway layup with 6:04 to play, Philadelphia led 94-77. ""We were just overthinking things,"" Simmons said. ""We were putting too much pressure on ourselves. We finally put it together."" The victory spoiled Victor Oladipo's best night of the season. He scored 24 points in the first half on 10 of 16 shooting and finished with a season-high 36 points. He also had seven assists, six rebounds and three blocks. But Oladipo and Domnatas Sabonis, who had 16 points and 11 rebounds, needed more help from their supporting cast to avoid losing their second straight home game. And when they didn't get it, the 76ers took advantage. ""We just didn't hit shots tonight, honestly,"" Oladipo said. ""I think we just need to loosen up a little bit and go back to playing free basketball."" TIP-INS 76ers: Had lost their last two to the Pacers. ... Robert Covington had 13 points, Landry Shamet had 12 and J.J. Redick scored 10. ... Redick has scored in double figures in 21 consecutive games since March 26. ... Philadelphia made 18 of 22 free throws but had only four offensive rebounds. ... Saric also had seven rebounds while Embiid had three blocks. Pacers: Have lost consecutive home games for the first time this season. ... Indiana is 5-2 against the Eastern Conference and 3-1 against Atlantic Division opponents. ... Oladipo extended his career-best streak of consecutive 20-point games to 11. ... Sabonis has scored 1,002 points since joining the Pacers last season. ... Indiana was 12 of 17 from the free-throw line and 8 of 31 on 3-pointers. ... the only other player in double figures was Bojan Bogdanovic with 13. THEY SAID IT 76ers: ""I was bad today,"" Embiid said, noting he had five turnovers. ""I thought the whole game was bad. I wasn't myself but my teammates picked it up for me. That was a good sight to see."" Pacers: ""We're playing good enough defense, keeping teams at or under 100,"" forward Thaddeus Young said. ""But in this league today, if you only score 98 or 94 points, it's going to be hard to win games. We're seeing it's very, very tough for us to win the game only scoring in the 90s.""","401070838"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  In a season when NBA teams are scoring more and playing faster on offense, the Memphis Grizzlies are taking the opposite approach -- relying on their defense. That certainly proved successful Wednesday night against the Denver Nuggets. Marc Gasol scored 20 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 4.6 seconds remaining, and Memphis edged the Nuggets 89-87 to end their five-game winning streak. The Nuggets (9-2) had a chance after Gasol's foul shots, but Nikola Jokic's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim and Denver's rebound tip was also off the mark. Memphis held the Nuggets to 39 percent shooting, including 8 of 32 from 3-point range. The 87 points were a season low for the Nuggets, and the 176 points combined by the teams tied for the fewest in an NBA game this season. ""We knew it was going to be an ugly game if we were going to have a chance of winning,"" Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said. ""We tried to get in the mud a little bit, be physical defensively and get the pace where we wanted it."" Jaren Jackson Jr. also had 20 points for Memphis, and Kyle Anderson finished with 14. Gasol grabbed 12 rebounds. Gary Harris led the Nuggets with 20 points, and Trey Lyles added 16 off the bench. Jamal Murray had 15 points and seven assists after scoring a career-best 48 in Monday night's win over Boston. Murray shot only 6 of 21 this time. ""I don't know what it was, but the ball didn't like me today,"" Murray said. Denver was up 83-82 before Memphis took the lead on a 3-pointer by Shelvin Mack with 1:45 left. Conley hit a floater with 40 seconds to go, but Lyles' dunk and a 22-foot jumper by Murray tied it at 87 before Gasol's winning free throws. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff told his team he wanted to get back to a defensive mentality and force opponents to fight through low-scoring games if they want to beat the Grizzlies. ""That's exactly what this win represents,"" Memphis guard Garrett Temple said. ""Holding this team -- as hot as they've been -- to 87 points at home ... it was a big win for us."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Murray was limited to seven points on 3-of-10 shooting in the first half. He missed his first four 3-pointers before converting one near the 9-minute mark of the third quarter. ... Jokic, who averages 11 shots a game, took just one -- his 3-point try in the closing seconds. ""I'll have to look at the tape to see what they are doing for him to only take one shot,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""Obviously, I would like him to take more shots, but right now he isn't shooting the ball and we will have to figure out why."" Grizzlies: Committed eight turnovers in the first quarter and finished with 18, compared to 19 for Denver. Memphis has had fewer turnovers than its opponent in every game this season. ... The Grizzlies (6-4) are 4-0 at home. . Gasol and Jackson had three blocks each. Jackson also made three steals. PACE OF PLAY The game was a contrast of styles, with Memphis relying on its slower-pace defensive approach against a Denver team that entered averaging almost 112 points per game. ""They definitely got us into their game,"" Nuggets reserve center Mason Plumlee said, later adding: ""It was a slow, slow game, so I think that benefited them."" Conley acknowledged Memphis can score 130 points in a game, but: ""Defensively, I do think this is what you should expect from us.""","401070839"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis made a 3-pointer, pulled up to hit a 10-foot jumper and threw down a two-handed reverse alley-oop jam in the span of about two minutes late in the first quarter. That pivotal stretch seemed to mark the end of Davis' recent shooting slump and the end of losing basketball for the New Orleans Pelicans. Davis had 32 points, 15 rebounds and four blocks in his best game since spraining his right elbow nearly two weeks ago, and New Orleans ended a six-game skid with a 107-98 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. ""I don't think it was entirely the elbow,"" Davis said. ""It was just me overthinking and hesitating on shots. Tonight I just played calm. The shots I felt comfortable shooting, I shot with no hesitation."" After missing four of his first five shots, Davis hit his next eight on his way to his first 30-plus point game since New Orleans beat the Los Angeles Clippers on Oct. 23. ""It was really big for him just to get his groove back,"" guard Jrue Holiday said. ""There were a couple games there like last game where he probably didn't shoot as well as he wanted to."" Holiday had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists while being guarded primarily by brother Justin. Julius Randle and Wesley Johnson each scored 12 points for New Orleans. ""We were just in a situation where we needed a win in the worst way,"" said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, whose team was back home after an 0-5 road trip. ""Just to come home and get a win, I think that takes a little bit of pressure off the guys."" Zach LaVine scored 22 and Jabari Parker had 20 points and 13 rebounds for Chicago, which has dropped five of six games. Justin Holiday and Wendell Carter Jr. each scored 17 points, and Carter also grabbed 11 rebounds. Davis' strong second quarter helped the Pelicans take 58-50 lead into halftime and New Orleans never trailed again, going up by as many as 18 late in the third quarter before Chicago rallied back to within single digits. ""We battled back tonight to make it a single-digit game there at the end,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""It all goes back to playing the right way from the beginning of the game. We've got a lot of work to do on both ends of the floor."" LaVine's 30-foot 3 cut New Orleans' lead to 94-88 with less than six minutes to go. But the Bulls never got closer. Jrue Holiday blocked a shot, hit a turnaround fade and added two free throws to help put the Pelicans up by nine with 1:30 left. ""He can do it on both ends, obviously,"" Davis said of Holiday. ""When he's playing like this, being the Jrue Holiday that we all know, we're definitely a tough team to beat and he's a tough player to guard."" TIP-INS Bulls: LaVine has scored 20-plus points in all 12 of his game this season. ... Ryan Arcidiacono scored 11 points, hitting three of four 3-point shots. ... The Bulls shot 39.6 percent (38 of 96) and missed 22 of 31 3s. Pelicans: Elfrid Payton missed his sixth straight game with a right ankle injury. Gentry said he's hopeful the starting point guard would be ready to return for New Orleans next game. ... Nikola Mirotic's recent long-range slump continued. He went 1-for-8 from 3, making him 10 of his last 43 from deep. He finished with nine points. ...... The Pelicans outrebounded the Bulls 55-46. ... Darius Miller hit three of four 3s and finished with 11 points. ... Holiday eclipsed 2,000 career assists with his fifth of the game. TURNOVER TROUBLE Although Chicago had won its previous game, both teams had largely struggled lately and the game got sloppy at times. New Orleans committed 15 turnover and Chicago 12. The Pelicans now have 103 turnovers in their previous six games. Against the Bulls, however, New Orleans had enough good ball movement to win, amassing 32 assists on 42 made field goals. PASSING OUT Davis had seven assists, giving him six or more in half of the eight games in which he has played. ""Knowing that a lot of teams are going to double-team me ... my job is to kick it out to the shooters and it's their job to make shots,"" Davis said. ""I've got to make the right plays, trust in my teammates and guys made shots tonight.""","401070840"
"Darrell Griffith, aka Dr. Dunkenstein, and former Jazz player, breaks down his favorite Donovan Mitchell dunk from Wednesday night. (0:23) SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell returned to Utah's lineup, and so did the Jazz's tenacious defense. The Jazz nearly led wire-to-wire in a 117-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night that snapped a four-game skid. They got there on the type of defensive play that propelled Utah into the playoffs a season ago. The Jazz clogged passing lanes and forced the Mavericks to make bad decisions. Dallas committed 25 turnovers, and Utah turned them into 31 points. ""We wanted to play our defense with some heart,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""I thought we did that. Now we got to add some smarts. That said, I thought we came out with the right frame of mind."" Mitchell scored 23 points in his first game back after missing a game with an ankle sprain. He also dished out seven assists and had five rebounds. Rudy Gobert had 17 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots. Alec Burks added 18 points off the bench. Utah earned its first home win of the season after opening with four straight home losses for the first time since 1974-75. The Jazz also snapped a four-game skid. Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 24 points. Harrison Barnes added 14 points, and DeAndre Jordan chipped in 11 points and 12 rebounds. Dallas lost for the seventh time in eight games. ""We had too many turnovers,"" Doncic said. ""That many turnovers, difficult to win a game."" Everything the Jazz need to be successful fell into place in the first half. Utah defended well, had strong ball movement and utilized smart shot selection. The end result is the Jazz pulled away from the Mavericks in quick and easy fashion. Utah seized control in the first quarter. The Jazz scored baskets on four straight possessions -- starting with a dunk from Derrick Favors and ending in a 3-point play from Gobert -- to take an 18-8 lead. Dallas closed within five points, making it 21-16 after J.J. Barea hit a pair of free throws. That's as close as the Mavericks would get. Seven turnovers undid any momentum Dallas could have created. The Jazz had a 13-0 advantage on points off turnovers by quarter's end. ""It's a big problem and we've got to get it solved,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""You give up 31 points on 25 turnovers on the road in the Western Conference, and you're going to have a rough night."" Utah strung together a 24-5 run over a seven-minute stretch spanning the first and second quarter. Mitchell rotated in with the second unit at the end of the first quarter and helped fuel much of the run. He assisted on three baskets in that stretch and scored another. Back-to-back baskets from Gobert and Burks punctuated the run and gave Utah a 45-21 lead with 7:18 left in the first half. HITTING FROM DEEP Dallas went 8 of 24 from the perimeter. It extended the team's franchise record to 193 consecutive games with at least five made 3-pointers. TIP INS Mavericks: Jordan collected at least 10 rebounds for a franchise record 11th straight game. ... Dallas outscored Utah 18-6 in second chance points. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Kawhi Leonard isn't making a big deal out of Toronto's NBA-best 11-1 start. He's trying to stay focused on the nuances of coach Nick Nurse's offense. Once that happens, Leonard says, the Raptors will really get rolling. Leonard had 25 points and 11 rebounds in his return from an ankle injury, and Toronto beat the Sacramento Kings 114-105 on Wednesday night. Pascal Siakam scored 21 points, Serge Ibaka had 14 points and 14 rebounds, and Kyle Lowry added 16 points and eight assists for the Raptors. ""This isn't our ceiling,"" Leonard said. ""With me not even knowing some of the offense, we have Kyle in the game most of the time. Once I start learning the offense, I can give him a little break and let him get some easier shots. I don't really know the offense in and out yet."" Toronto has won five straight since its lone loss this season at Milwaukee on Oct. 29. The Raptors pulled away against the Kings despite 23 turnovers. ""We were lucky to come out with this one,"" Danny Green said. ""You look up and down the line, the only thing we beat them in was rebounding. That's a good sign for us, to show how good this team can be."" Leonard sat out the previous two games and got off to a sluggish start early against the Kings before helping Toronto pull away. The two-time All-Star scored 10 points in the second quarter and 10 in the third, including a soaring, one-handed dunk through traffic. Leonard also made a pivotal 3-pointer in the fourth after Sacramento had pulled to 106-99. ""He was a little rusty at the start but he made some really big baskets late,"" Nurse said. ""They sent lots of bodies to him, which was good for us to see."" Toronto has won three straight against the Kings. Willie Cauley-Stein and Buddy Hield scored 24 points apiece for Sacramento. De'Aaron Fox added 20 points, and second overall draft pick Marvin Bagley III had 13. The Kings have lost two straight since winning five in a row. ""They don't make a lot of mistakes and they tortured us for the mistakes that we did make,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""They did a good job of bottling us up."" Toronto ended the first quarter on a 15-4 run, then took control once Leonard got going in the second after Sacramento got in foul trouble. Leonard made five free throws in the period, one coming after a frustrated Joerger was called for a technical foul for arguing with officials. Leonard also had a 3-pointer that put the Raptors up 49-40. Green added back-to-back 3s, and OG Anunoby followed with a steal and dunk as Toronto took a 64-51 halftime lead. BOARDING UP Toronto held a 51-35 rebounding edge, an area where the Raptors have not had much success this season. The 51 boards were a season-high for Nurse's team. ""I told them we did one rebounding drill today at shootaround and look what happened,"" Nurse said. ""So look for some more in practice coming up."" IT'S ALL ABOUT PACE The Kings are one of the fastest teams in the NBA this season and several Toronto players felt that Sacramento controlled the tempo of the game. Lowry disagreed. ""They were picking us up, tried to pressure us to try to speed us up but we didn't allow them to,"" Lowry said. ""We did a good job of staying locked in into what we were doing."" TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had his string of nine consecutive games with 10 or more assists snapped. ... Siakam scored 13 points in the first half on 5-of-7 shooting. ... Norman Powell was held out because of a left shoulder injury sustained Monday against Utah. Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic made his season debut after missing the first 10 games recovering from a pair of procedures on his left knee.

Nemanja Bjelica was called for a technical early in the third.","401070842"
"LOS ANGELES --  Tyson Chandler savored the ovations when he first took the court in downtown Los Angeles. The cheers at the end were even sweeter. The Lakers' newest big man got to represent his hometown Wednesday night for the first time in his 18 NBA seasons, and he came up bigger and better than even he expected in a hard-fought win. LeBron James had 24 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and Kyle Kuzma scored six of his 21 points in the final minutes of the Lakers' 114-110 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. James, Kuzma and Josh Hart played major roles in the Lakers' third win in four games, but they all directed praise toward Chandler, who joined the Lakers on Tuesday after reaching a buyout agreement with Phoenix. After LA's savvy basketball fans welcomed Chandler to town with cheers, the veteran provided much of what the Lakers have been lacking this season. ""It's honestly all love,"" Chandler said. ""I love this city the way they love me. When you're homegrown from here and going to high school and all that and you've had these same fans, and now you represent the jersey that everybody has been cheering for their entire lives, you kind of become one. I've been on the other side and played the villain. Now it's great to be on this side and actually rep them."" With only a cursory knowledge of the Lakers' plays and schemes, Chandler still provided defense, rebounding and hard picks while playing a surprising 23 minutes. Chandler's nine rebounds included two enormous offensive boards in the last minute. He then contested Derrick Rose's final 3-point attempt, forcing a miss that essentially sealed the win. ""You can tell he's a young-old guy that's happy to be back home, and he played with a lot of energy tonight,"" said Rajon Rondo, who was thanked by Chandler for vocally directing him around the court. Hart scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 20 for the Lakers, who avenged a loss at Minnesota nine days earlier with a tenacious finish at Staples Center. Kuzma's fourth 3-pointer put the Lakers up 111-104 with 1:51 to play, but Rose promptly hit back-to-back 3-pointers for the Wolves. After Chandler twice extended the Lakers' ensuing possession, Kuzma hit one of two free throws with 9.5 seconds left. Rose then missed his last 3 under heavy defensive pressure from Chandler, and Hart hit two free throws to seal it. Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau thought Rose deserved a foul. ""They're not going to give me that call,"" Rose said with a shrug. ""They haven't been giving me that call, so I've just got to get used to it."" Rose scored 31 points and Jimmy Butler added 24 for the Timberwolves, who dropped to 0-7 on the road this season with their fourth consecutive loss overall. Minnesota had won five straight over the Lakers. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Butler converted a four-point play to tie it at 94 with 7:44 to play. ... Thibodeau used the same starting lineup from Monday's loss to the Clippers. Lakers: James fell just shy of his 75th triple-double, but scored nine points in the fourth quarter. ... Chandler grew up in several parts of California before moving to Compton, where he starred at Dominguez High School and became the No. 2 pick in the 2001 NBA draft. ... Chandler backed up JaVale McGee, who had 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting. GOOD STARTS Minnesota came out in an offensive groove during its second straight game at Staples Center following Monday's loss to the Clippers. All five Wolves starters reached double figures in the first half while hitting 66 percent of their shots. Rose and Wiggins hit three 3-pointers apiece and all five starters contributed to an 11-for-17 performance beyond the arc, tying the franchise record for 3s in a first half. But the Lakers didn't get humiliated in the first quarter, as they did last Sunday in their loss to Toronto. Hart hit four 3-pointers in the first half, and Kuzma hit a buzzer-beating 3 to limit Minnesota's lead to 67-65. BAD BOARDS Minnesota was outrebounded 47-40, and it was most glaring in that final minute. ""Very, very frustrating to know we were that close, and all we have to do is rebound the basketball,"" Butler said. ""But that's been the story for us so far. We've been right there. We've been outrebounded. We have to figure out a way to go get the ball.""","401070843"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder have figured out how to win without Russell Westbrook -- they lock down on defense. Paul George scored 20 points, and the Thunder beat the Houston Rockets 98-80 on Thursday night for their seventh straight victory. Westbrook missed his second game in a row with a sprained left ankle, and the Thunder have won both. Oklahoma City held Cleveland to 37 percent shooting in a 95-86 victory Wednesday night, then limited Houston to 38 percent shooting on Thursday. George led the defensive charge with six steals. ""We didn't come in tonight thinking this was going to be an offensive battle, where we've got to outscore them on the offensive end,"" he said. ""We're just going to stick to playing defense. We've got guys that can guard and want to guard. That's just what it comes down to. (Defense) is what we're going to hang our hat on."" Oklahoma City got plenty of help from Houston -- the Rockets made just 11 of 42 3s. It was the fifth time in seven games that the Rockets failed to score at least 100 points. ""Maybe because all we do is talk about defense 24 hours,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Our offense is anemic. I mean, it's bad."" James Harden scored 19 points, but made just 7 of 19 shots. Clint Capela added 17 points for Houston, which had won three in a row despite its offensive struggles. Houston's Carmelo Anthony, who played for the Thunder last season and was traded this summer, scored two points on 1-for-11 shooting. Chris Paul added 10 points, five assists and six steals. Steven Adams had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Terrance Ferguson and Dennis Schroder each added 14 points for Oklahoma City. All five Thunder starters scored in double figures before the end of the third quarter. The Thunder led 59-45 at halftime behind 53.8 percent shooting. In the second quarter, George made all five of his shots and scored 14 points. Oklahoma City held Paul and Anthony scoreless before the break. Jerami Grant dunked on a lob from Schroder and made the free throw on the foul to put Oklahoma City up 80-60, a score that held up until the end of the third quarter. The Thunder coasted in the fourth. ""I don't know if we're just sagging because we don't believe in what we're -- I don't know,"" D'Antoni said. ""We've got to find the answers."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon missed his third straight game with a strained muscle in his right thigh. ... Anthony was mostly cheered when he checked into the game for the first time in the first quarter. ... Reserves made 1 of 11 shots in the first half. ...

QUOTABLE Adams, on defending Houston's outside shots: ""We knew they were going to put up a lot of threes. They're a 3-point-shooting team. The whole game plan was to try to get as many contests, and we did. It's not just contesting, mate. We did a good job at really getting out there and getting them in an uncomfortable position."" BENCH ROLE Houston's reserves shot a combined 6 for 27 from the field and made just 3 of 18 3-pointers. Oklahoma City's reserves shot 8 for 21.

"PHOENIX --  When their shots finally started to fall, the Boston Celtics couldn't be stopped. Kyrie Irving scored 18 of his season-high 39 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, and Boston rallied from a 22-point deficit for a 116-109 win over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. Irving scored Boston's first six points in the extra period, and Marcus Morris finished with 17 against his former team -- including the tying 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left in regulation off a feed from Irving. Morris hit from the top of the arc to tie it at 100. Jaylen Brown added 17 points, all after halftime, for the Celtics (7-4). ""Guys like Kyrie, he is going to have all the focus on him,"" Morris said. ""I worked on my 3-pointers extensively."" Devin Booker paced the Suns (2-9) with a season-high 38 points, and T.J. Warren had 29. The Celtics ended a two-game skid, while the Suns have lost nine of 10. Booker scored 12 points in the fourth quarter and seven in OT, but Phoenix couldn't hold onto a 16-point lead with 6:13 to play in regulation. The Suns led 92-76 when Booker dropped in a short fadeaway. ""We just fell apart down the stretch. Kept giving up quick buckets. Miscommunications on defense. A little bit of everything,"" Booker said. Boston recovered from an ice cold start and won despite shooting 40.2 percent from the field. The Celtics trailed by double digits for much of the second half until a furious late rally. Suns rookie Deandre Ayton had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Irving hit a 3 with 35.1 seconds to go in the fourth, then his steal led to Brown's layup that cut the Suns' lead to 98-97 with 7.3 seconds to play. Warren hit two free throws, then Morris took a pass from a double-teamed Irving for the tying 3. ""We just learned a lot about being resilient,"" Irving said. ""We had to make adjustments."" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov thought fatigue caught up to his team late in the game. He also wanted a foul against Irving on the Celtics' last possession of the fourth quarter. ""You take the blame and responsibility as a coach,"" Kokoskov said. Warren, starting for the first time since Oct. 31, scored 14 first-quarter points as the Suns took advantage of Boston's shooting woes. Phoenix led 32-13 after 12 minutes. After making their first shot of the game, a 3 by Irving, the Celtics missed their next 12 attempts and the Suns raced out to a 15-3 lead. Aron Baynes' putback with 5:04 left in the first quarter was the Celtics' second basket of the game, and they shot just 4 of 22 in the quarter. Boston got the lead down to 14 in the second, but a 3 from Booker gave the Suns a 48-26 advantage with 4:31 left in the half. The Celtics trailed 55-35 at the break. Consecutive baskets by Booker put the Suns in front 75-58 in the third quarter. ""I told Igor we didn't deserve to win the game, but it was a great individual performance by Kyrie, certainly,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. TIP-INS Celtics: The team's 13 points in the first quarter were a season low. ... Irving was the only starter to make a field goal in the first half. Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward and Brown were a combined 0 for 15. ... G Marcus Smart surpassed 1,000 rebounds and 400 steals for his career. Suns: Warren made his third start this season. Ryan Anderson came off the bench. ... Booker has 146 points in his last three games against the Celtics, including the career-high 70 he scored in Boston on March 24, 2017. ... A game after playing a season-low seven minutes, 2017 first-round draft pick Josh Jackson played only five. ANALYZING AYTON Stevens called Ayton a ""special talent"" when asked about the rookie before the game. ""He brings everything to the table you would think a really good player at that position brings,"" Stevens said. JAYLEN JAM Brown's first basket was a high-flying, one-handed dunk in transition at the 10:10 mark of the third quarter. Smart provided the assist.","401070845"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A gritty group of Trail Blazers backups was able to put away the Los Angeles Clippers. Damian Lillard had 25 points and Portland won its third straight game, 116-105 over the Clippers on Thursday night. It was a tight game until the fourth quarter, when the Blazers' reserves were able to get some separation. ""That was a grind-it-out kind of game. I thought our team did a good job just being present for the entire game. Our bench once again came through, with the spark down the stretch,"" Lillard said. ""End of the third, beginning of the fourth they had a really good stretch, opened it up a bit and left it there for us to close it out."" CJ McCollum added 23 points for Portland, which has won six of seven. The bench contributed 41 points and was critical when Lillard and McCollum rested at the beginning of the final period. Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams each scored 20 for the Clippers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a career-high 19. Portland had struggled all night to separate from the Clippers, but pulled in front 93-83 on Zach Collins' dunk with 9:42 left. Another dunk by Collins put the Blazers up 100-90 with 6:10 to go. The Clippers closed to 107-101 on Gallinari's jumper, but Jusuf Nurkic answered for Portland with a layup and Los Angeles could not get any closer down the stretch. ""I thought down the stretch -- the last eight minutes of the game -- our offense really let us down,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. There were questions before the game about the availability of Clippers forward Tobias Harris because of illness. Rivers said Harris was a game-time decision, but he was ultimately in the starting lineup. Harris, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, finished with 15 points and 11 boards for his fifth double-double this season. The Clippers were without Avery Bradley for the second straight game because of a left ankle sprain, and Luc Mbah a Moute missed his seventh game with a sore left knee. The Clippers missed Bradley's perimeter defense against Lillard and McCollum. Portland was without Maurice Harkless, who has missed seven straight games because of a sore left knee. Jake Layman has been starting in his place. The Blazers led 37-28 after the first quarter, paced by McCollum's 10 points. Portland never could extend the lead to double digits and led just 61-57 at the break. Gilgeous-Alexander and Montrezl Harrell each had 12 first-half points for the Clippers, while Lillard led all scorers with 14. Al-Farouq Aminu hit a 3-pointer that gave Portland a 78-68 lead, its largest to that point, midway through the third quarter. The Clippers narrowed it again, closing to 81-77 on Harris' driving floater. ""We didn't start the game with very good defense. In the first quarter we gave up 37 points,"" Gallinari said. ""Our defense got better but in the fourth quarter they were better than us, especially in the last five or six minutes when they were able to expand the lead."" Nurkic fouled out with 1:57 left, finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds. TIP-INS Clippers: The team put out a statement of sympathy for victims of the mass shooting in ThousandOaks, California, on Wednesday night. ThousandOaks is located northwest of Los Angeles. ... The Clippers were coming off a 120-109 win at home over Minnesota. Trail Blazers: The club held a moment of silence for victims of the shooting in California. ... Portland was coming off a 118-103 win at home over Milwaukee on Tuesday. ... The Blazers have won the last four meetings between the teams. ... Lillard did not shoot a free throw. CONTINUITY Before the game, Rivers said a key to the Blazers' success is their core group has been together for some time. Portland returned 11 players this season, including all five starters. ""I think our time together, how good we get along together, our understanding of what our coaches want us to do, our understanding of each other -- I think it's all coming together,"" Lillard said.","401070846"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry has counted on staying healthy after injuries limited him to 51 games last season. Everything was going according to plan for the Golden State star -- until Thursday night. The two-time MVP left with a leg injury and the Warriors were unable to recover in a 134-111 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks that snapped their eight-game winning streak. ""He seems good to me. I've got to talk to him tomorrow and see how he's doing,"" teammate Kevin Durant said. ""Hopefully he's doing well."" Eric Bledsoe scored seven straight points during Milwaukee's big third quarter and finished with 26. Giannis Antetokounmpo added 24 points, nine rebounds and four assists as the Bucks handed the Warriors their first defeat at home this season. The two-time defending NBA champions were already missing All-Star Draymond Green and then lost Curry midway through the third. Curry strained the adductor muscle in his left leg and went to the locker room shortly thereafter. He did not return. Curry grabbed at his inner thigh after trying to contest Bledsoe's shot in transition at the 6:50 mark of the third. He was receiving treatment postgame and is expected to have an MRI on Friday. Klay Thompson led the Warriors with 24 points and Durant had 17 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. Curry scored 10 points in his second straight game below 20 after getting at least 23 in every game previously -- including five 30-point performances and a 51-point outing in three quarters. He dished out six assists in 26 minutes. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said his players took the floor with ""mindless intent"" and then hurt themselves with foul trouble. ""Sometimes you've got to get hit in the mouth in this league to remind you how hard it is to win a game,"" he said. Malcolm Brogdon scored 20 points and Khris Middleton had 17 points and six assists as Milwaukee (9-2) won for the second straight time at Oracle Arena after a 116-107 victory on March 29. The Bucks outscored the Warriors 41-28 in the third and shot 65 percent inside the arc (43 of 66) overall. ""To come in here and play the defending champs and have a win like this, it's huge,"" Brogdon said. ""It's huge for our confidence. I think it sends a message around the league, but regardless we have to continue to play hard every night and play on both ends."" Antetokounmpo had 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block by halftime as the Bucks led 64-51 at the break. Bledsoe hit back-to-back layups to put the Bucks ahead 84-64 midway through the third then answered Curry's jumper with a 3-pointer the next time down. Donte DiVincenzo's basket at the 4:06 mark made it 93-69 and Kerr called a timeout. Jordan Bell had four points and five rebounds for the Warriors while moving into the starting lineup in place of Green, sidelined after spraining his right foot and toe in the first half of Monday's win over the Grizzlies. Golden State (10-2) is still tied for the second-best start in franchise history behind the 2015-16 team that began 24-0. The Warriors dropped to 6-1 at home. ""They just played hungrier than us,"" Thompson said. ""It was just an ugly night at the office."" TIP-INS Bucks: Held a 46-38 rebounding advantage. ... Milwaukee made it to the free throw line 19 times and made 15 of those in the first half to a 7-of-8 showing at the stripe by Golden State. ... The Bucks shot 5 of 20 from 3-point range in the first half. Warriors: Golden State shot 4 for 15 from deep in the first half and Thompson was the lone player to score in double figures. ... Bell made his 14th career start and first of the season. ... G Shaun Livingston missed his sixth straight game and eighth in the last 10 with a sore right foot. ... Andre Iguodala returned after sitting out Monday against Memphis as a rest day, checking into the game for the first time late in the opening quarter. ... Baron Davis of the 2007 ""We Believe"" Warriors received a roaring ovation when introduced and shown on the big screen 4:39 before halftime. MOMENT OF SILENCE A moment of silence was held for victims of the mass shooting in ThousandOaks. Kerr said he is ""devastated"" for the victims and families in a ""horrifying"" shooting he read up on Thursday. Of taking time before the game to remember the victims, Kerr is becoming accustomed to doing so. ""We had one last week and we're probably going to have one next week,"" he said. ""That's the reality until we do something about it. It's beyond sad.""","401070847"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Nikola Vucevic had 21 points and 14 rebounds and D.J. Augustin came up with big plays in the final two minutes to help the Orlando Magic beat the Washington Wizards 117-108 on Friday night. Augustin had six points, an assist and a steal after Washington cut a 25-point deficit to one at 106-105 with 2:30 remaining. Aaron Gordon added 20 points for Orlando, which shot 51 percent in beating Washington for only the fourth time in their last 21 meetings. Evan Fournier and rookie Mo Bamba had 15 points each, and Augustin finished with 11. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 27 points, and Wall had 19 points and 12 assists. Washington fell to 2-9.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid repeatedly stepped to the free throw line with one thought in mind during critical moments of the Philadelphia 76ers' overtime victory against the Charlotte Hornets. ""Got to make them,"" Embiid said. ""They call me `clutch' for a reason, so got to make them."" Embiid was 14 for 16 from the line between the fourth quarter and overtime to help ice the 76ers' 133-132 victory Friday night. He had 42 points and 18 rebounds. The Hornets fought back from a 21-point deficit and led by five with 1:18 remaining in regulation before the Sixers forced extra time. Kemba Walker scored 19 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter for the Hornets. Embiid challenged the Hornets' defense as they attempted a comeback victory and focused on drawing contact.  Hornets starting center Cody Zeller fouled out in regulation after committing five fouls in the fourth. ""It's tough keeping him off the free throw line just because he is so physical,"" Zeller said. ""He can shoot it from three, play off the dribble, he's obviously a wide body in the post, so those are the toughest guys to defend that can play kind of play at every spot on the court."" Embiid thrives on getting to the line where he is shooting 81.8 percent, up from 76.9 percent last season. He has earned the confidence of the Sixers to aggressively seek out shots there. ""He's a really good shooter anyways and he's confident by nature, so that's a pretty good collision of skill and mind,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""You trust him going to the line and shooting a high percentage. He's not afraid of the moment."" Embiid's execution down the stretch left the Hornets searching for answers on defense. ""I thought our bigs were great,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""They battled him. I thought they were fantastic defensively. They tried to beat him to spots. I don't know what to tell them when Embiid shoots 16 free throws in the fourth quarter and overtime, I don't know what to say to them."" To Embiid, the abundance of free throw attempts were all in a day's work. ""That's my job,"" he said. ""I've got to step up when there's an opportunity."" The Sixers improved to 7-0 at the Wells Fargo Center, the most home wins to start the season since 2002-03. MISSED OPPORTUNITY The Hornets committed a shot-clock violation with time winding down in regulation, missing an opportunity. ""I didn't lose track of time,"" Walker said. ""I just wanted to get the last shot. I wish I had got a better shot, but yeah, I just wanted to get something off. I wanted the last shot, that was really it.""

"ATLANTA --  The Detroit Pistons were so efficient on offense that they didn't need Blake Griffin to take many shots. The NBA's fifth-leading scorer loved sharing the ball on an easy night for his team. ""We just did a great job of taking exactly what the defense gave us,"" Griffin said. ""When we play like that and the ball is zipping and moving around, then it's a lot more fun."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 11 rebounds, Stanley Johnson added a season-high 22 points and the Detroit Pistons beat the Atlanta Hawks 124-109 on Friday night. In a game that was essentially decided in the first quarter, the Pistons were so dominant that they scored 74 points and led by 23 at halftime Griffin 0 for 2 from the field. ""He was very unselfish,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""He made the right plays."" Drummond's double-double was the 300th of his career, most in the league since his rookie season of 2012-13. The Hawks had nobody capable of matching up with his 6-foot-11, 279-pound frame. Drummond has hit 31 field goals, shot 62 percent and pulled down 54 rebounds in his last three games. The rebuilding Hawks, featuring one of the NBA's youngest rosters, have lost three straight and seven of eight. Jeremy Lin finished with 19 points. Trae Young added 16, and Omari Spellman had 14 points and 10 rebounds. ""It was right off the bat,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Slow start, sluggish. Our starting group, whether it's after halftime or to start the game, just lacking in the effort department. We have to figure it out. Rough night."" Griffin didn't take a shot until the 2:20 mark of the second, heading to halftime with seven assists and five rebounds in his first 10 minutes. His first basket, a 3-pointer from the left corner, came with 5:14 to go in the third, pushing the lead to 93-67. He finished with nine rebounds, nine assists and six points.

"MIAMI --  Winning on the road is supposed to be the tough part. Not so for these Indiana Pacers. Victor Oladipo had 22 points and 10 assists, Bojan Bogdanovic put Indiana ahead to stay on a 3-pointer with just under a minute remaining and the Pacers beat the Miami Heat 110-102 on Friday night for their fifth consecutive road victory. Indiana closed on a 16-2 run, the last 12 of those unanswered. ""They came to play,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""I told them, `Let's just ball,' and I thought they balled tonight."" Domantas Sabonis and Darren Collison each scored 17 for Indiana and Bogdanovic finished with 16 for the Pacers, who were coming off two home losses. Sabonis finished with 11 rebounds for the Pacers. Indiana held Miami to 37 percent shooting in the second half. ""Defense, no question about it,"" Oladipo said. ""Nothing else."" Kelly Olynyk led the Heat with 20 points, but missed most of the fourth quarter with an injury. Josh Richardson scored 18, Tyler Johnson had 15 and Hassan Whiteside ended up with 11 points and 20 rebounds for Miami. The Heat were again without Dwyane Wade, who's excused while he and wife Gabrielle Union-Wade continue celebrating the birth earlier this week of their daughter. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is calling Wade's absence day-to-day, though said the team will give him as much time as he wants and needs. ""I've seen us execute much better,"" Spoelstra said. ""But you do have to credit Indiana."" Olynyk left early in the fourth holding his midsection. Olynyk was kneed by Indiana's Tyreke Evans around the ribs, and remained down for a couple minutes before going to the locker room. It was part of a rough night for Olynyk -- he took an elbow in the face from Indiana's Thaddeus Young late in the first half. Young was ejected for the Flagrant-2 foul. Evans was called for an offensive foul on the play that knocked Olynyk from the game for most of the fourth; he returned in the final seconds. Miami led by 11 early and held a six-point lead with 3:50 left, then went cold -- shooting 1 for 8 with four turnovers the rest of the way. Bogdanovic's 3-pointer from the top of the key was the 12th and final lead change of the night, and capped the Pacers' rally from what had been as much as an 11-point deficit. ""That was Pacer basketball,"" McMillan said. ""I thought defensively we got after it, especially that second half."" Miami debuted its ""Vice"" court and uniforms, the black, fuchsia and light blue color scheme designed as nod to the city in the 1980s and the team's original home -- Miami Arena.

Rony Seikaly is the other, and he pulled the feat off four times. ... Miami was without Goran Dragic (right knee inflammation), who may try to play Saturday. ... Miami's first field-goal attempt came 3:37 into the game -- its first six possessions ended in either turnovers or trips to the foul line.

The Nets overcame a big bounce-back night from Denver's Nikola Jokic to win their third straight. In an offensive funk for the last four games, Jokic had a season-high 37 points and tied his career best with 21 rebounds. It wasn't enough to prevent Denver's first home loss of the season, thanks to LeVert's heroics. His defense helped hold Gary Harris to four points on 1-of-11 shooting, and then he beat his former Big Ten rival at the end. Jokic took only one shot Wednesday night in a loss to Memphis, a 3-pointer in the final seconds that would have given Denver the win. He took only 18 shots in the first four games of November but topped that before the end of the third quarter. He had 11 points in the first quarter and a double-double with 20 points and 12 rebounds at halftime. ""He was just aggressive,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He took advantage of some chances."" Jokic, normally jovial in postgame interviews, was subdued after Friday's loss. He said he didn't lack confidence in Memphis and said about Friday's game that he ""was feeling the ball tonight."" Denver appeared to take control after Jokic blocked Jarrett Allen, grabbed the rebound and fed Malik Beasley for a layup and a 108-106 lead with 1:23 left. After a Brooklyn miss, Paul Millsap's two free throws made it a four-point game. The Nets tied it with 29 seconds left and Jokic was called for traveling with 22 seconds left. LeVert got the ball up top and was blanketed by Harris. He broke through the tight defense to get into the lane and hit a soft lob to give Brooklyn the win. ""I just tried to get the last shot and get the kind of shot I wanted to get,"" LeVert said of Harris ""I thought he was going to scoot back at one point but he kind of pressed up the whole time. I saw him leaning so I just took it."" D'Angelo Russell led the Nets with 23 points, and Allen had 18. TIP-INS Nets: DeMarre Carroll scored nine points in 14 minutes in his season debut. He missed the first nine games following right ankle surgery. ... The Nuggets played a short tribute video for Kenneth Faried's return to Denver. Faried was traded to Brooklyn after seven years with the Nuggets. Nuggets: Denver attempted two free throws in the first half and 32 in the second half. ... Harris's four points were a season low. It is the first time in 12 games he hasn't scored in double figures. GOT YOUR BACK Malone defended Jokic for his comments last week that drew a $25,000 fine from the NBA. Jokic's was dinged for his use of a gay slur after a win in Chicago on Oct. 31. ""There's so many things being said about this poor kid, and I understand some of it,"" Malone said. ""Those of us who know him, give the kid a break. He made a mistake, he paid for it, get off his back a little bit. He's a great kid, he loves everybody and meant no offense to anybody. He's going to be fine and let the kid be a 23-year-old young kid who's going to have a great, great future in a Nuggets uniform."" BARTON UPDATE Denver swingman Will Barton talked Friday morning, the first time he spoke to the media since having surgery to fix core and hip muscle injuries. There is no timetable for his return. Barton said Friday he's ""getting stronger every day"" but doesn't know when he can get back. ""Whenever this thing lets me. I wish it was tomorrow,"" he said. ""I'm taking it day by day."" Barton was carted off the floor on Oct. 20 against Phoenix after he said he felt something pop when he took off for the basket. He had surgery days later.","401070852"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Gordon Hayward got a cold reception in Utah. He was booed every time he touched the ball, and his Boston Celtics left town with a loss. Joe Ingles matched his career high with 27 points and added a season-best seven assists to help the Jazz beat the Celtics 123-115 on Friday night in Hayward's return to Salt Lake City. Hayward had 13 points and seven assists in 25 minutes during his first game back in Utah since leaving the Jazz as a free agent to sign with the Celtics after the 2016-17 season. He broke his left ankle in Boston's opener last season. The star forward spent his first seven NBA seasons with the Jazz after they drafted him ninth overall in 2010. He averaged 15.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists for Utah, but took the hostile reaction from Jazz fans in stride. ""I kind of expected some of that,"" Hayward said. ""They were booing me from the get-go, so it's part of the game."" Boston trimmed a 20-point deficit to four by the fourth quarter. Playing without injured Kyrie Irving, the Celtics closed within four on multiple occasions late in the period, the final time on a 3-pointer from Marcus Smart that made it 111-107 with 2:19 left. Rudy Gobert quickly answered with a layup that pushed the lead back to six. Jayson Tatum followed by missing back-to-back layups that could have cut the deficit again, and Boston never got closer. Jae Crowder finally slammed the door on the comeback with a corner 3 that gave Utah a 117-109 lead with 47.7 seconds left. Utah coach Quin Snyder thought his team turned a corner by hanging tough down the stretch against the Celtics. ""Our team has not been able to handle successes during games at times,"" Snyder said. ""We've lost focus sometimes when we've hit shots. Teams are going to come back on you, but you can't make it easy on them."" Donovan Mitchell scored 21 points for Utah. Crowder had 20, and Gobert finished with 17 points and 15 rebounds. The Jazz won their second straight home game and second in a row overall. ""We all have picked it up, picked up our energy defensively, picked our focus up,"" Mitchell said. ""We've been having great practices, but we just didn't put it into the games. I think over the past couple of games, we've done that."" Terry Rozier scored a season-high 22 points, making his first start in place of Irving, and Jayson Tatum added 21 for the Celtics. Boston lost for the third time in four games after allowing Utah to shoot a season-high 56 percent from the field. ""As good as we were defensively in the first nine games, I don't think we've been as good the last three,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""I thought we actually did an OK job on the initial drives in isolation, but we didn't get rebounds in a lot of cases. Our pick-and-roll defense, we just have to really shore it up."" The Jazz started to pull away when they hit 3-pointers on each of their final four possessions of the second quarter to take a 58-51 halftime lead. Ingles accounted for the first three long-distance baskets, highlighting a 20-point first half for him. Utah opened the third quarter on a 17-6 run. Mitchell ignited the spurt by draining three free throws and driving for a layup on back-to-back possessions. Derrick Favors kept it going with back-to-back baskets that gave the Jazz a double-digit lead and finished the run off with a pair of free throws that put Utah ahead 75-57 just four minutes into the quarter. ""Defensively, we didn't pay attention to details,"" Rozier said. ""We just didn't have a presence out there, so they played freely."" The Jazz built their lead to 83-63 on a layup by Crowder before Boston rallied in the fourth quarter. The Celtics scored on four straight possessions, culminating in Tatum's layup, to ignite a 15-4 run. Rozier nailed a 3 to cap off the run and cut Utah's lead to 100-96. QUOTABLE ""I mean, they know. I'll leave it at that."" -- Crowder on whether his 20-point performance was motivated by a desire to show the Celtics they made a mistake when they traded him to Cleveland before the 2017-18 season. TIP-INS Celtics: Smart set a season high with 10 assists, one shy of his career high. Smart also scored 13 points for his first double-double of the season. ... Boston had 28 points off 17 Utah turnovers. ... The Celtics gave up a season-high 35 points in the third quarter. Jazz: Ingles made five 3s, moving him ahead of Deron Williams (511) on Utah's career list. Ingles has 512 3-pointers with the Jazz. ... Utah finished with a 45-28 advantage on the boards. ... The Jazz scored 50 points in the paint.","401070853"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Kings coach Dave Joerger didn't like most of what he saw from his team in the first half against Minnesota. The second half was an entirely different story and had Joerger beaming afterward, even though Sacramento nearly blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. Willie Cauley-Stein had 25 points, Nemanja Bjelica scored eight in a row during a big run late in the third and the Kings beat the slumping Timberwolves 121-110 on Friday night to spoil a huge game for Karl-Anthony Towns. ""I didn't think we played very well in the first half and still had a two-point lead,"" Joerger said. ""We're growing. This is a very good win for us. I think you saw maybe we wore them down a little bit in the second half."" Coming off back-to-back losses to East powers Milwaukee and Toronto, the Kings led by 15 early in the fourth but had to hold off a late surge by Minnesota to end a three-game losing streak to the Timberwolves. Sacramento's high-tempo offense was pivotal on both ends, as Minnesota eventually got tired in the second half. ""We just keep running,"" De'Aaron Fox said. ""Even if they score, we're not worried about that. We're getting the ball up and down the court."" Fox had 16 points and 10 assists for Sacramento. Iman Shumpert scored 17 and Bjelica finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. Towns had a season-high 39 points and 19 rebounds on a night when Minnesota's inconsistent offense sputtered. ""To win you have to play with a certain intensity level and we're not playing well right now,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""It's not any one particular person. It's not any one particular thing. It's all things. Hustle can make up for a lot and so that's what we have to get back to."" The Timberwolves trailed by 14 midway through the fourth before Derrick Rose made consecutive 3-pointers to start a 12-0 run. Minnesota had a chance to tie the game but Jimmy Butler missed two free throws with 3:19 left. Sacramento took advantage of a pair of turnovers and scored the next seven points to pull away. ""We have to do a better job closing,"" Sacramento's Buddy Hield said. ""I messed up on a ball screen at the top of the key. It's on us to lock in mentally and focus."" Rose had 21 points, five assists and six rebounds. Butler was a game-time decision but played 41 minutes and had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The Timberwolves are 0-8 on the road. ""We just didn't play transitional defense,"" Towns said. ""That's what we need to do. That's why we get hit with another `L' on this trip and haven't found a way to win."" Sacramento missed 11 of its first 14 shots and fell behind by 12 early in the first quarter. Cauley-Stein helped rally the Kings in the second, scoring eight points as Sacramento took a 63-61 halftime lead. Towns made his first five shots and was 7 of 9 in the first quarter as Minnesota jumped out to a 12-point lead. He cooled off a bit in the second but made two 3s and had 29 points and eight rebounds by halftime. DELAYS, DELAYS The first half ended on a strange note when the Kings were called for two fouls with 0.6 seconds left, both coming as Minnesota tried to inbound the ball. The Timberwolves made one of the two ensuing free throws and eventually got the ball in, but Taj Gibson missed a 15-footer at the buzzer. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns had nine offensive rebounds. . Two days after setting a franchise record with 20 3-pointers, the Timberwolves failed to find their stroke beyond the arc, going 7 for 25. ... Andrew Wiggins (bruised right quad), Jeff Teague (bruised left knee) and Justin Patton (right foot) were held out. Kings: Kosta Koufos made a 19-foot jumper at the buzzer to end the first quarter. ... Bogdan Bogdanovic, who underwent a pair of left knee procedures in the offseason, was rested two days after making his season debut.","401070854"
"TORONTO --  A big effort from the bench helped make up for rare off nights by two of the Raptors' biggest scoring threats. Pascal Siakam scored a career-high 23 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 19 points and 10 rebounds and Toronto beat the New York Knicks 128-112 on Saturday, improving its league-leading record to 12-1. Kawhi Leonard scored a season-low 12 points, failing to reach 20 for the second time in nine games. Kyle Lowry scored 10 points, one better than his season worst. ""That was our focus, to really do a job on those two,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""You've got to pick a poison and their role players really stepped up and made shots."" OG Anunoby scored 16 points, and Serge Ibaka and Delon Wright each had 12 as the Raptors won their sixth straight home meeting with the Knicks, all of them by 10 points or more. Toronto, which has won six straight overall, improved to 7-0 at home. ""Everyone is confident, everyone is working hard and just playing the game,"" Siakam said. ""It doesn't matter what night it is, we just want to go out there and play."" Toronto's 62 bench points were a season high. ""We have one of the deepest teams in the NBA,"" Wright said. ""We can go pretty far into our bench."" The Raptors' Nick Nurse became the first coach to win 12 of his first 13 games since Lawrence Frank started 13-0 with the New Jersey Nets in 2004. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 27 points and Enes Kanter had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who have lost 16 of their past 19 against the Raptors. ""That's why they're so good,"" Hardaway said of Toronto. ""They have that supporting cast that comes in and they take care of business. It's as simple as that."" Siakam shot 6 for 7, including a career-best three 3-pointers, and went 8 for 9 at the free-throw line. Siakam's outburst made up for a quiet night from Leonard, who didn't make his first basket until a layup with 45 seconds to go in the first half. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year shot 2 for 7, missing both of his 3-point attempts. Toronto led 64-53 at halftime, but New York shaved the gap to three points with a 12-4 run to start the second half.
