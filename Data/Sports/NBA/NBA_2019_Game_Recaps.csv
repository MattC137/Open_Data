"Joel Embiid knows the 76ers didn't play well and says it was particularly hard losing on a national stage, but he has hope for the future. (1:08) BOSTON --  The Celtics will need time to figure out how to get the most out of their loaded roster this season. It didn't stop them from picking up their first victory on a night they celebrated the official return of their two biggest stars. Jayson Tatum had 23 points and nine rebounds, and the Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 105-87 on Tuesday night in the season opener for both teams. Boston won despite shooting just 43 percent (42 of 97) from the field and 30 percent from the 3-point line (11 of 37). But the Celtics' struggles didn't dampen the mood inside TD Garden for the return to regular-season action for Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Hayward said it was ""amazing"" to be back out there. ""My adrenaline was pumping those first three or four minutes,"" Hayward said. ""I think everybody's adrenaline was pumping. It was sloppy at first. It was great just to be out there. It was a big step for me."" Marcus Morris added 16 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Al Horford had nine points and five blocks. The Celtics survived a lethargic start and rough shooting night but rallied to lead by as many as 18 in the second half. Including the playoffs, Boston has won 10 straight games at home over Philadelphia, which it defeated in the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. Joel Embiid led the 76ers with 23 points and 10 rebounds. Ben Simmons finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. Embiid made it clear afterward the 76ers have a way to go to be on the Celtics' level. ""This not a rivalry,"" he said. ""I don't know our record against them. But it's pretty bad. They always kick our ass. So this is not a rivalry."" Hayward played in his first game since undergoing surgery and more than 10 months of rehabilitation for the gruesome left ankle injury he suffered five minutes into last year's season opener. He received an extended ovation from the home crowd during a pregame introduction that included a video montage of his rehab process. Irving was also back following a pair of surgeries on his left knee that caused him to miss the end of the regular season and playoffs. After receiving loud ovations during pregame introductions, Irving and Hayward both had sluggish starts. Hayward missed his first four shots before making back-to-back jumpers. Irving missed his first nine attempts from the field. He didn't score until finally connecting on a pair of free throws early in the third quarter. They shot a combined 6 for 26 for the game. Hayward finished with 10 points and five rebounds in 25 minutes. Irving had seven points and seven assists. The Celtics missed seven of their first 10 shots and the Sixers started just 4 for 11. The Sixers also committed 11 first-half turnovers that led to 10 Celtics' points. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he isn't worried. ""If we can guard like that, we've got a chance to be decent,"" he said. TIP-INS 76ers: Outscored the Celtics 50-34 in the paint. ... Jerryd Bayless (left knee), Wilson Chandler (strained left hamstring), and Mike Muscala (sprained left ankle) all sat out. Celtics: Have won 15 of last 17 regular-season meetings with 76ers. ...  Outrebounded the 76ers 55-47. TURNING POINT Boston got some distance in the second half thanks largely to its bench, which outscored its Philadelphia counterparts 44-26. The Celtics opened the second half on a 14-5 run, hitting five of their first seven shots. ""We're all just unselfish,"" said Terry Rozier, who finished with 11 points and eight rebounds. ""The depth, that's the most special part about this team."" FULTZ STARTS One of the biggest changes for Philadelphia entering the new season is the insertion of second-year guard Markelle Fultz into the starting lineup. The No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, he missed 68 games with a shoulder injury and was plagued by shooting issues and confidence problems. Fultz finished with five points, three rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes.","401070213"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry is coming off an injury-plagued season and a summer he thought might be among his best yet. On a festive night of celebration as another championship banner went up, Curry brought his usual flair and dazzle. Kevin Durant did all of the little things, too. Curry had 32 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, Durant added 27 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and the Golden State Warriors opened their quest for a three-peat by holding off the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-100 on Tuesday night. ""I love who we are, game 1 of 82,"" Durant said. ""Just keep grinding."" Golden State needed a strong fourth quarter after the two-time defending champions received their 2018 rings in a pregame ceremony shortly before tipoff and began the final season at Oracle Arena before a move across San Francisco Bay to new Chase Center . ""It's a great move for the organization. We know that but this place is special, so we want to make sure this is a special season,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Klay Thompson shot just 5 of 20 for 14 points while center Damian Jones scored 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting for the Warriors in his first career start and 26th game. Kerr knows his players are still getting in shape and looked tired, saying: ""We didn't look much like ourselves. It's not surprising either. We need a couple more weeks."" Curry called it ""an emotional night"" but then the Warriors had to refocus and get to work. ""We played a solid game, nothing spectacular, we had a lot of mistakes,"" Curry said. ""We understand the process of kind of building up."" Paul George scored 27 points for the Thunder, who struggled to find an offensive groove while missing star Russell Westbrook because of knee surgery last month. Oklahoma City trailed by 10 at the break then came out of halftime making 9 of 12 shots to go ahead 69-66 before the Warriors rallied. ""I was really encouraged and pleased with the way we came out in the third quarter,"" coach Billy Donovan said. ""Last year at times it was a struggle for us."" Versatile Warriors All-Star Draymond Green, limited during the preseason by a sore knee, wound up with two points, 13 rebounds and five assists in nearly 33 minutes. Curry, who shot 11 for 20 with five 3s, notched 17 30-point performances during his injury-shortened 2017-18 season. These teams met in a season opener for the first time -- though the Warriors won on the road against the Seattle SuperSonics in 1983. Golden State lost last year's opener at Oracle after a title run, 122-121 to the Rockets. TIP-INS Thunder: OKC started 1 for 9, missing its initial three 3-point tries, and went 6 of 23 in the opening period (1 for 9 on 3s). ... The Thunder were outrebounded 57-46 but grabbed 16 on the offensive glass. ... C Steven Adams started after he had been questionable with lower back stiffness. Warriors: Andre Iguodala experienced left calf tightness and played 10 minutes, all in the first half. ... Reserve G Shaun Livingston, who had been questionable with right foot soreness, played 14 minutes. MOMENT OF SILENCE The Warriors showed a photo of late Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen on the big screen wearing a Portland hat, offering a tribute and moment of silence. Allen, a Microsoft co-founder who also owned the Seattle Seahawks, died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to his company Vulcan Inc. He was 65. ROCK THE VOTE Kerr encouraged fans to register to vote in a (hash)RockTheVote message on the scoreboard, while the Warriors also did so on social media with Twitter and Facebook posts. THE RINGS Players' rings -- what the team said are the first reversible championship rings ever -- were lowered from the rafters with blue and yellow lightsabers. Kerr called them ""obscenely beautiful"" and noted he much prefers the banner raising for its significance. At the end of the ceremony, Curry took the microphone and called out longtime equipment manager and director of team operations Eric Housen to receive his ring in a lovely gesture to someone so important to the operation behind the scenes. Recently retired big man David West, part of the last two title teams, sat courtside and received his ring. Representatives from each of the franchise's championship seasons were on hand for the festivities.","401070214"
"HOUSTON --  Anthony Davis couldn't help but notice James Harden's freshly minted MVP trophy sitting at midcourt before a ceremony during warmups on Wednesday night. After Harden hoisted the trophy for the first time before the Toyota Center home crowd and received a few MVP chants throughout the night, Davis began to make an MVP case of his own. Davis had 32 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high eight assists while Nikola Mirotic scored 30 points to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 131-112 win over the Houston Rockets in their season opener. ""When it was sitting there before the game, I glanced at it, and then I had to lock back in for the game,"" Davis said. ""That stuff will take care of itself. As long as we keep doing what we're doing as a team, the rest will come on its own."" Davis added three blocks and three steals, while Mirotic shot a sizzling 6 of 8 from 3-point range, and Julius Randle had 25 points off the bench. ""We moved the basketball and we made shots, but we put our hats on and defended,"" Davis said. ""To come out with a win against a team like that after the season they had and coming off the season we had, we wanted to come out and set a tempo for ourselves."" Eric Gordon led the Rockets with 21 points off the bench, while P.J. Tucker and Chris Paul both added 19 points. James Harden had 18 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. ""A little bit of legs and non-communication and giving them easy points, easy opportunities -- a little bit of everything,"" Harden said. ""But first game, you just continue to build those good habits and continue to get better every single game. We'll be all right."" The Pelicans dominated the first half, taking an early lead and never relinquished it as they hammered the undersized Rockets in the paint. New Orleans led 71-54 at the break and led by 29 points in the second half. The Pelicans outrebounded the Rockets 54-37. ""It was a good win for us, but to be honest, we feel like if we play at the level we're supposed to -- we're not surprised,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We played exactly how we have to in order to beat that team."" New Orleans dominated Houston in paint scoring, 76-44, and also shot 40 percent on 10 of 25 shooting from 3, compared with a rusty 33.3 percent (16 of 48) from the Rockets. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni didn't seem overly alarmed by the defensive display, praising New Orleans' energy. ""They played harder, longer and did a better job,"" D'Antoni said. ""They played great, but at the same time, there was a period in there where we got really tired and then trying to figure things out, being tired doesn't work, and we didn't have the energy and we kind of let go of the rope at the end of the first half. We obviously have some things to work on, we've got to get our legs and then go after it."" Coming off the bench for Houston with seven minutes remaining in the first quarter, Rockets offseason pickup Carmelo Anthony received a standing ovation when he entered the game wearing his trademark headband and the No. 7. Anthony made his first two shot attempts, the first, from 3, and finished 3-of-10 shooting for nine points in 27 minutes. TIP-INS Pelicans: C Jahlil Okafor (right ankle sprain) entered the game late in the fourth quarter, playing less than two minutes. Rockets: PG Michael Carter-Williams (left knee soreness) played on a minutes restriction as a precaution, with D'Antoni setting the cap around 15 minutes. Carter-Williams played 16 minutes and had 10 points. ... Centers Nene (right calf tightness) and Zhou Qi (left knee sprain) did not play. MOMENT OF SILENCE Before the game, the Rockets honored the life of late Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen on the big screen wearing a Portland hat, offering a tribute and moment of silence. Allen, a Microsoft co-founder who also owned the Seattle Seahawks, died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to his company Vulcan Inc. He was 65. A PERFECT 10 Elfrid Payton's minimalist triple-double made him the first player to record exactly 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a single game since March 2, 2013 when Kyle Lowry did it for Toronto. It was Payton's 11th career triple-double. HE SAID IT ""For all you analytics guys, we're not winning 82 (games) this year. That's done, that's all about how it's been proven."" -- D'Antoni.","401070215"
"PHOENIX --  Much of the talk going into the Dallas-Phoenix season opener centered on rookies Deandre Ayton and Luka Doncic. But it was Devin Booker's show, providing impressive evidence why the Suns thought him worth that five-year, $158 million deal. Booker scored 19 of his 35 points in the final 6:44 and lifted the Phoenix Suns to a 121-100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in the teams' season opener on Wednesday night. ""I'm not surprised. Suns fans are not surprised,"" Phoenix first-year coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""That's who he is."" The 21-year-old guard, who missed the entire preseason after undergoing a surgical procedure on his right (shooting) hand, sank four 3s, converted a three-point play, made a driving layup and hit two free throws after Dallas had cut what had been a 16-point lead to four. ""Just caught a rhythm,"" Booker said. ""It was that time of the game. We let them back in when we should have put them away, so I felt it was my job to make the plays to win the game."" Ayton got the best of Doncic on this night, but there will be many more to follow. Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, made 8 of 11 shots for 18 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and had six assists. Doncic, the No. 3 overall pick, struggled from the field, making 5 of 16 shots -- 0 of 5 3-pointers -- for 10 points. He had four assists and eight rebounds. ""I had a lot of fun,"" Ayton said. ""This is the most fun I've ever had playing basketball. Being at the top-top level, I wouldn't say I had one bad thing to say about this game."" Doncic said he ""was really happy that I could make my dream come true, but it wasn't the best game."" Trevor Ariza added 21 points, Josh Jackson 18 and T.J. Warren 17 for the Suns, who gave Kokoskov a victory in his NBA head coaching debut. Kokoskov had Booker playing point guard down the stretch. ""You're trying to land the plane with your best unit,"" Kokoskov said. The Mavericks, already without Dirk Nowitzki and Harrison Barnes, lost Devin Harris to a strained left hamstring in the first quarter and never led after the game's opening minute. Dwight Powell led six Dallas players in double figures with 16 points. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said the team's defense was the problem, particularly in the first and fourth quarters. ""Forty-six points (allowed) in the second and third quarters is pretty decent,"" he said. ""... but 75 combined in the first and fourth is disastrous."" Ayton made his first shot, was fouled by Doncic, and the three-point play put Phoenix ahead 3-2. The Suns led the rest of the night. Phoenix twice stretched the lead to 16 in the third quarter and was up 83-73 entering the fourth. But consecutive 3s by Dallas' Wesley Matthews and Jalen Brunson cut the Suns' lead to 94-90 with seven minutes to play. Booker followed with a driving layup, added a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired and converted a three-point play to put Phoenix up 102-94 with 4:34 to go. The Suns made 19 of 34 3s, seven of nine in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki, entering his 21st NBA season, is out indefinitely recovering from left ankle surgery. ... Barnes missed the opener with a right hamstring strain. ... Doncic was part of the Slovenia national team coached by Kokoskov that won the EuroBasket gold medal in 2017. ... Dallas was 10 of 33 on 3-pointers. Suns: G Jamal Crawford, whose signing was announced earlier in the day, was not in uniform. ... Phoenix has won six straight against Dallas, sweeping the three games last season, when the Suns won a league-worst 21. ... Isaiah Canaan, coming back from a gruesome leg injury sustained on the same court last season, got the start at point guard. ... Canaan was one of nine players to start at point guard for Phoenix last season.","401070216"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Markelle Fultz heard 20,000 Philadelphia 76ers fans exhort him to shoot each time he touched the ball, a roaring confidence boost for a No. 1 pick closer to a bust than brilliance. Fultz had the look he wanted in the second quarter. He dribbled to the foul line without a defender in his path, pulled up and uncorked a jumper. The ball rattled around the rim before it fluttered through the net. Sixers fans rose to their feet, erupted in cheers and chanted ""Fultz! Fultz! Fultz!"" Yes, a simple jumpshot from the top pick of the 2017 draft in the second game of the season was enough to get a rise out of the fans -- and a sigh of relief from Fultz. ""It makes me feel better for the whole crowd to feel as good as I want to,"" Fultz said. The curious case of Fultz's missing jumper continued against the Bulls when one of the more scrutinized players in the NBA managed to steal the spotlight from his more accomplished teammates with routine -- yet highlight-reel worthy -- baskets. Until he gets his shot right, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid will continue to lead the Sixers. Simmons had a triple-double with 13 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists and Embiid had 30 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers past the Chicago Bulls 127-108 on Thursday night. Fultz scored 12 points on 5 of 15 shooting, the most shots taken by a Sixer. ""He shot it to mean it,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""He didn't look afraid of anything. He missed the shots but they looked good."" Fultz is coming off a miserable rookie season that was shortened because of a right shoulder injury, a broken shot and busted confidence. Even his personal shooting coach said Fultz suffered from the ""yips,"" an assertion shot down on media day by the second-year guard. Fultz simply blamed his lost season on the injury. Brown tried to give Fultz a confidence boost by putting him in the starting lineup -- yet has benched him for the start of the second half. Fultz was 1 of 6 in 15 minutes in the first half and didn't play again until late in the third and the Sixers leading by 88-68. ""The challenge is to grow him and help us win the game,"" Brown said. ""There's no book that tells you how to do that, so you're going to have to figure some stuff out. There will be some pain along the way and some positives."" With or without Fultz, the 76ers had plenty of positives after an opening-night disaster in Boston. Simmons reached a triple-double with 2:34 left in the third, the 13th of his career and the first Sixer to ever get one in the home opener. Sixers fans chanted ""Trust the Process!"" when Embiid ended the third with free throws. Fultz proved a long-range ace again in the fourth -- this time with a 3! He drained his first career 3-pointer for a 108-88 lead and the Philly fans that are firmly perched in his corner went wild and again chanted his name. The Sixers know that if they want to become legitimate Eastern Conference contenders, Fultz will have to become the star they envisioned when they drafted him. ""I'm never afraid,"" Fultz said. ""I worked hard this summer. Tonight, I didn't make a lot of them, but I'm going to keep shooting them. If I see an open shot, I'm going to go shoot it."" He didn't even mind when Chicago's defense sagged off him, daring him to take shots. The Bulls, not expected to win much in the East, scored a combined 35 points in the second and third quarters. Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 30 points in their season opener. ""When we started missing shots, we stopped guarding and rebounding,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. TIP-INS Bulls: G Kris Dunn missed the game for the birth of his son. ... Bobby Portis had 20 points and 11 rebounds. 76ers: Rapper Meek Mill sat courtside and rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell to start the game. ... Embiid thanked the fans for coming and told them to ""Trust the Process."" 1ST Q &amp; NO D Embiid scored 12 points in the first 5 minutes of the game and neither team missed many looks in the first quarter. The Sixers made 11 of their first 14 shots and the Bulls started 14 of 19. The 76ers shot a whopping 70 percent in the quarter and still trailed the Bulls 41-38.","401070217"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  LeBron James' debut for the Los Angeles Lakers opened with two thunderous dunks and closed with a loss. He finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds, but the Portland Trail Blazers prevailed 128-119 Thursday night in the season opener for both teams. James insisted the new-look Lakers were going to be a work in progress. ""It's not instant oatmeal. It's not that fast,"" James said. ""It takes some time to get that chemistry where you can just close your eyes and know exactly where guys are."" Damian Lillard had 28 points and Nik Stauskas came off the bench to score 24 for Portland, which won its 18th straight home opener to extend an NBA record. It was the Blazers' 16th straight victory over the Lakers. The opening festivities were tempered by the death this week of Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen. A ""Rip City"" baseball cap rested in Allen's courtside seat with a single rose. The enigmatic co-founder of Microsoft died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was 65. There was moment of silence before the game and tributes to Allen throughout the night. On the court, the focus was all on James. His monster dunks to start stunned the Moda Center crowd while Nike co-founder Phil Knight looked on from courtside seats. James signed a four-year, $153 million deal with the Lakers as a free agent in the offseason after winning three NBA championship rings and taking his team -- Miami and Cleveland -- to the NBA Finals for each of the last eight seasons. The four-time league MVP joined a revamped group that includes veterans Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley, as well as a young core of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart and rookie Moe Wagner. While the Lakers made big changes in the offseason, the Trail Blazers returned all five starters from a team that finished third in the Western Conference last season -- including the nucleus of Lillard, CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic. ""We wanted to come out and start the season right and to honor our owner, Mr. Paul Allen. That's what tonight was all about for us, not about the noise surrounding the game,"" Lillard said. James' putback gave Los Angeles a 25-15 lead. He played just under nine minutes in the opening quarter and led all scorers with 13 points. Portland pulled in front 46-40 on Stauskas' 3-pointer. Stauskas, who signed with the Blazers as a free agent this past summer, led all Blazers with 16 points in the opening half. Portland pushed the lead to 11 but led just 65-63 at the break. ""He really got in a groove and the guy can shoot, we've seen it in practice,"" coach Terry Stotts said about Stauskas. ""I was really happy for him to start the season like that with a new team. The shots that he made were all in the flow of the offense."" James had 18 points but collected a third foul with 6:04 left in the half. Kuzma's dunk got the Lakers within 79-78 with just more than four minutes left in the third quarter. Hart's 3-pointer -- the Lakers' first of the game -- put Los Angeles up 85-83. The lead was short-lived, but Portland had just a 93-91 advantage going into the final quarter. Stauskas hit a 3-pointer that put Portland up 107-100 with 7:22 left. After it fell, he turned to the crowd and pounded his chest. McCollum's 3-pointer with 5:01 left put Portland up 114-104. Caldwell-Pope's 3-pointer with 30.7 seconds left got the Lakers within 124-118, but Stauskas made a pair of free throws and Los Angeles couldn't catch up. TIP INS Lakers: Lakers coach Luke Walton said Ball would continue to be on a playing-time restriction after having an offseason procedure on his knee. Ball played 20 minutes and scored seven points. ... Hart had 20 points off the bench. ... Los Angeles made 7 of 30 3-point attempts. Trail Blazers: With Maurice Harkless dealing with a knee injury that bothered him in the preseason, Stotts started Jake Layman. ... McCollum finished with 21 points. HONORING ALLEN On the edge of the Blazers court was painted PGA with a Rose, and the Blazers had similar patches on their jerseys to honor Allen. Stotts talked before the game about all the people Allen had touched. ""Everybody talks about his philanthropy throughout the years, and what he's done. When people started writing about it, and listing all the things and all his accomplishments and the impact on millions and millions of people, and the environment, the earth and everything -- it's hard to put into context, the magnitude,"" the coach said. ALL EYES ON US With James joining the team, the Lakers are certainly dealing with greater scrutiny with a huge media contingent on hand for his debut. ""We've talk about it, not to let it be a distraction. We're not going to let it influence what we're trying to do on this team,"" Walton said. ""In fact, we're trying to use it as something to grow a bond in our group. Our theme is to truly believe in the idea that it's just us, just us that are in here working, just us that are getting better.""","401070218"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard isn't quite back up to speed after missing most of last season. That's just fine with the Toronto Raptors. They are plenty happy with the way Leonard is playing right now. Leonard had 31 points and 10 rebounds, Serge Ibaka added 21 points and the Raptors beat the Boston Celtics 113-101 on Friday night in an early matchup of Eastern Conference contenders. Leonard, who was limited to nine games last season with San Antonio mostly because of a quadriceps injury, posted his second straight double-double and played 36 minutes, one fewer than he had Wednesday night a season-opening win over Cleveland. ""I'm not looking to get back to where I was before,"" Leonard said. ""I'm worried about the now and the player I'm trying to become now and tomorrow."" Leonard made 10 of 25 attempts, including 2 of 5 from 3-point range, and went 9 for 9 at the free throw line. ""No matter who Kawhi was against, Kawhi was doing well,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Leonard scored 15 of his points in an explosive third quarter, making 5 of 7 from the floor and 5 of 5 at the free throw line. ""Tonight he played extremely hard,"" Kyle Lowry said. ""He really was aggressive. That's the kind of thing we're gonna need for the whole season."" Lowry scored 15 points, Danny Green had 14, and Fred VanVleet 11 to help the Raptors win for the 11th time in 12 home meetings with the Celtics, including the past seven in a row. ""That's a good home win right there,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Kyrie Irving scored 21 points for Boston, and Al Horford had 14 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. ""Tonight was a great test for us,"" Irving said. ""We just came up short."" Jayson Tatum scored 16 points and Jaylen Brown had 13 for the Celtics. ""I thought they played a lot better than us in the second half,"" Stevens said."" We had our moments offensively but all the rebounds they got, especially late, really hurt us."" Boston's Gordon Hayward scored 14 points in 24 minutes, connecting on six of 13 field goal attempts. ""I felt like I found a little bit of rhythm there in the second half,"" Hayward said. ""It was a good start for me. Each game will be progress."" Still, it wasn't all good for Hayward, who suffered a gruesome left ankle injury five minutes into last year's season opener and didn't return. ""There's times where it still feels like I'm not playing like myself, I'm thinking too much out there,"" Hayward said. ""I felt like I was doing that in the first half a little bit."" Brown made a 3-pointer to give the Celtics an 87-86 lead with 9:03 remaining. VanVleet answered with a reverse layup, the first basket in a 6-0 spurt that gave Toronto the lead for good. ""They executed much better than we did,"" Horford said. ""We didn't take care of the ball as well as we could have down the stretch."" Green and Lowry each made 3-pointers around an offensive foul by Tatum with just over two minutes remaining, giving the Raptors a 107-99 edge. Green went 4 for 7 from long range, while Lowry made 3 of 5. MR. OCTOBER Serenaded by `MVP' chants from the sellout crowd of 19,800, Leonard said he appreciated the sentiment, if not the timing. ""It's a little too early,"" he said. ""I appreciate the support. I know they're excited about us winning the game tonight."" GIVING PAUSE Irving wrapped up his postgame scrum by apologizing to reporters for saying `um' so often in his replies. TIP INS Celtics: Horford took and made the only free throw by a Boston starter through the first three quarters. The Celtics finished 7 for 10 at the line while the Raptors were 14 for 19. ... Irving shot 10 for 20 from the field. ... Tatum had nine rebounds Raptors: G Delon Wright (left thigh) missed his second straight game. ... F OG Anunoby started the game wearing protective goggles but took them off after the first. Anunoby left Wednesday's win over Cleveland because of a right orbital contusion. ... Toronto made one change to its starting lineup, with Ibaka replacing Jonas Valanciunas. ... VanVleet led the Raptors with seven assists.","401070219"
"Jonas Jerebko tips in Kevin Durant's missed shot in the final seconds to secure a 124-123 win over the Jazz. (1:02) SALT LAKE CITY --  Jonas Jerebko returned to Utah and got what he was looking for. Jerebko crashed the basket and tipped in a shot against his former team with 0.3 seconds remaining to lift the Golden State Warriors to a 124-123 victory over the Jazz on Friday night. ""My teammates knew this was a big game for me coming back here. I wanted to win and told them I really wanted this one,"" said Jerebko, who couldn't stop smiling after the victory. Kevin Durant, who scored 38 points, missed a running jumper. But Jerebko, who was let go by Utah as a free agent after last season and who was just subbed in to spread the floor with his long-range shooting ability, charged in from the right side and delivered the game-winning put-back. ""I took the ball out, so I knew I was going to give it to K.D. and I knew he was going to shoot it, so I just tried to get to the rim,"" Jerebko said. Jerebko, who finished with 10 points, punched the air in celebration and then was mobbed by his new teammates in a scene that looked more like a playoff game than the second game of the season. ""To win that game in that way, that was really special,"" Jerebko said. Durant thought his last shot was going down, but he couldn't have been happier for Jerebko. ""Jonas was there in the right place at the right time. It was very fitting that he comes back here and gets the game-winning tip. We were very excited for him afterwards,"" Durant said. The Jazz had taken their last lead when Jae Crowder scored off his own miss with 51.4 seconds left in the game. Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Draymond Green had 14 points, nine rebounds, six assists and a fistful of attitude. Joe Ingles paced the Jazz with 27 points, including seven 3-pointers, and Donovan Mitchell added 19 points, but missed all six of his fourth-quarter attempts. ""It's more physical,"" Mitchell said. ""They're taking away my easy looks. I just got to be able to hit the tougher shots. That's all it is."" Crowder had 17 points and Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 11 rebounds. Dante Exum gave the Jazz a 111-101 advantage with 8:53 left in the game. The Warriors responded with their most inspired defense of the night and went on a 13-0 run -- Draymond Green's layup made it 114-111 -- to set up the game-ending fireworks. High scores have been common in the first week of the NBA season, but the Jazz and Warriors took it to a new level, especially in the first half, which ended with Utah leading 81-69. In a role reversal, the Jazz were the ones letting shots fly from behind the arc with 46 3-point attempts. The Jazz made 19, while the Warriors made 10 of 19 from long range. After the Warriors whittled their 16-point deficit down to 3, Ingles beat the third-quarter buzzer with a running, double-pump 3-pointer from 37 feet. SHOOTING STARS? Ingles recently called himself the best shooter in the NBA. When asked about that claim, Stephen Curry joked, ""That just means in Las Vegas in summer league in 2009 we had two of the best shooters of all time on the same team. . We got a lot in common then."" Curry averaged 17.4 points in five summer league games for Golden State while teammate Ingles shot 20 percent from the field in scoring 3.2 points per game. NOT LIKE THE GOOD OL' DAYS As a member of the Chicago Bulls championship teams in the late 1990s, Kerr said this contest wasn't like the knock-down, drag-out games between Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen versus John Stockton and Karl Malone. ""I remember being in this building about 20 years ago in the Finals and literally, the final score was like the halftime score tonight. That shows you how much the game has changed."" TIP-INS Warriors: Allowing 47 points in the second quarter ties a record for a Golden State opponent. Atlanta did it first in 1990. ... There were 26 lead changes and 12 ties in the first half. ... Twice, Green pushed Gobert after fouls and the result of the second shoving match was double-technicals on Green and Favors. ...

Jazz: After the late evening tip, the game was stopped on the first play for several minutes because of a clock malfunction. ... The Jazz set a franchise record of 81 points in the first half. ...

"WASHINGTON --  All's going well for Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors at the moment, off to a 3-0 start and even winning without new star Kawhi Leonard in the second half of a back-to-back. Nothing's going right for John Wall and the Washington Wizards, 0-2 after a pair of losses at home and unable to rebound well while waiting for new big man Dwight Howard to make his season debut. Taking over while Leonard got a night off, Lowry delivered 28 points and 12 assists, and backup guard Fred VanVleet hit a key shot with 14.6 seconds left to help Toronto beat Washington 117-113 Saturday. ""We are never going to force anything,"" Lowry said about playing without Leonard, who was rested while his team was in action for the third time in four days. ""Whatever happens, I'm going to stay within the game, always trust my teammates in every situation."" Lowry sank a 3 before hopping into the lap of a front-row spectator, putting the Raptors ahead 109-101 with 3 minutes remaining, part of a personal seven-point run. Then came a key sequence: Lowry put up a shot that was knocked away near the rim by Otto Porter Jr.,  a play initially ruled goaltending. After a review, though, it was ruled a clean block. Play resumed with a jump ball at center court, Toronto got possession and a full shot clock. Lowry let time run down, and VanVleet put up an awkward, off-balance jumper that somehow went in. ""Tough shot,"" said Wall, who had 25 points and six assists. Said VanVleet: ""At that point, you just want to get a shot up and get an attempt, and I was able to knock it down."" Bradley Beal scored 32 points and became the career leader in 3-pointers for Washington, which finished the game without ejected coach Scott Brooks. Moments after Beal argued a call while on defense, he got incensed when he thought Toronto should have been called for a foul when Wall tumbled to the court on a drive to the basket. There was no whistle, though -- except for the technical foul on Beal. ""I disagreed with the call on John. He got tripped. The referee told me I ran up on him and so he called a tech. So I guess he felt threatened,"" Beal said. ""Next thing I know, Coach Brooks is gone."" Wall and Brooks got into it with the officials, resulting in Brooks' ejection. Lowry made two free throws to boost the Raptors' edge to 102-89. ""Frustration built up,"" Brooks said. ""We've got to play through whatever we think is against us. Just play through it. And quite honestly, I set a poor example."" This was a rematch from the opening round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last season, when the Raptors were seeded No. 1 and eliminated the No. 8 Wizards in six games. While Washington largely relies on the same core of players, it added Howard, who missed all of training camp, the preseason and the first two games with a sore backside. Ian Mahinmi started at center and did not exactly distinguish himself, accumulating more personal fouls (four) than points (two). Leonard averaged 27.5 points and 11 rebounds in his first two games with Toronto after arriving in a trade with the San Antonio Spurs. He only played in nine games for San Antonio in 2017-18, missing most because of a quadriceps injury. OG Anunoby started in place of Leonard and contributed 12 points -- all in the first half. ""We've got a spirited group,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said, ""that's ready to fight."" TIP-INS Raptors: Jonas Valanciunas and Serge Ibaka each scored 16. ... 15-4 against the Wizards over the last five years. Wizards: Outrebounded 52-37 overall and 14-9 on the offensive glass. ""If we keep getting out-rebounded the way we are,"" Wall said, ""we're going to keep finding ways to lose."" OP3? Brooks was critical of starting forward Otto Porter Jr., lamenting: ""Got to get yourself open"" and ""He has to play faster."" BEAL FOR 3 Beal surpassed Gilbert Arenas' previous team mark of 868 3s by making his 869th with a little more than 4 1/2 minutes left.","401070221"
"LOS ANGELES --  Once the fists started flying late in the fourth quarter, LeBron James' home debut with the Los Angeles Lakers was relegated to the undercard. A wild multiplayer fight that included the normally mild-mannered Chris Paul and Brandon Ingram stole part of the spotlight shining on LeBron's official landing on the West Coast. The Houston Rockets stole the rest with a gritty victory. James scored 24 points, but Paul, Ingram and Rajon Rondo all were ejected after trading blows late in the Rockets' 124-115 win Saturday night. Before the late drama overshadowed everything, James got several big ovations from a tremendously lively sellout crowd in his first home game since joining the Lakers as a free agent. ""The atmosphere was great,"" James said. ""The fans were extremely excited. We gave them everything that we could. Wish we could have gave them more with this win, but it was very electric."" But perhaps that energy -- and a flagrant foul by Houston's James Ennis III against Josh Hart earlier in the fourth quarter -- contributed to the shocking fight that broke out with 4:13 to play. The Rockets were clinging to a 109-108 lead when Ingram was called for a foul while trying to defend an aggressive drive by James Harden, who finished with 36 points. Furious with the call, Ingram shoved Harden and then confronted referee Jason Phillips after getting a technical foul. In the ensuing group argument, Paul stuck a finger into the face of Rondo, who responded by punching his fellow point guard. Ingram then threw punches in the melee. James attempted to break up the fight by grabbing Paul, his friend. Paul claimed Rondo caused their fight by spitting on him. ""Unacceptable,"" Houston's Carmelo Anthony said. ""We all know what happened. Ain't no need to keep going back and forth about that. What happened was unacceptable. It shouldn't have happened."" Rondo's teammates said they didn't know whether Paul's claim was accurate. Lakers coach Luke Walton said his players were playing with extra aggravation after Ennis clotheslined Hart on a flagrant foul 4  1/2 minutes earlier. ""I felt like the other team was trying to provoke us, and we fell for it,"" said the Lakers' Lance Stephenson, another peacemaker in the brawl. When tempers cooled after a nearly 10-minute break, Houston finished the game on a 15-8 run. Harden hit a key 3-pointer with 1:12 left to propel the Rockets to their first win of the season. ""We played amazing tonight, and I feel like the fight probably put us back,"" said JaVale McGee, who had 16 points and six rebounds in his own Lakers home debut. ""If there wasn't the fight, we probably would have won that game."" Paul had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds before getting tossed. Clint Capela had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Anthony scored seven points off the bench as Houston rebounded from an embarrassing season-opening loss to New Orleans. Rondo had 13 points and 10 assists before getting thrown out. LeBron also had five rebounds and five assists, but he went 1 for 8 in the fourth quarter, missing all three of his 3-point attempts. ""Yeah, James was James. That's what he does,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""I thought it was a great game. It had some intensity and quickness, and how fast it was."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden got a technical foul in the second quarter when he halfheartedly shoved Stephenson, who sold it impressively. ... Houston hasn't lost a season series with the Lakers since 2010-11. ... Gerald Green scored 13 points. Lakers: Ingram had 12 points before his ejection. ... Rookie C Moe Wagner wasn't ready for his home debut while he recovers from a bruised left knee. ... Lonzo Ball showed off his retooled jumper with four 3-pointers and 14 points. DISCIPLINE COMING The fight could leave with both teams without key rotation players due to suspension. NBA fights rarely get serious enough for the punches thrown by the principals in this brouhaha, and league discipline executive Kiki VanDeWeghe was actually in attendance. The Rockets are staying in LA to play the Clippers on Sunday night, and Houston coach Mike D'Antoni laughed at the possibility of a suspension for CP3. ""I don't know, I might rest him (on a) back-to-back,"" D'Antoni said. ""We'll see what the NBA says."" FIRST STEP The Lakers dropped to 0-2 after James' West Coast chapter formally began Thursday with a 128-119 road loss to the Trail Blazers. James scored 26 points in Portland, but the Lakers' team vibe could take many weeks to solidify before they can compete regularly with veteran playoff-contending rosters. The Rockets are a few months removed from reaching Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, and they've added Anthony to their attack. ""We've got a long way to go to get to the Rockets, to get to a lot of teams in the Western Conference,"" James said. ""They've just been together for so long. We'll learn from our mistakes and get better.""","401070222"
"LOS ANGELES --  Three games into his NBA career, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is getting used to playing in crunch time. The rookie is pretty good when it counts, too. Montrezl Harrell led a fourth-quarter charge by the Clippers' reserves with 17 points, Gilgeous-Alexander added 12 and Los Angeles defeated the Houston Rockets 115-112 on Sunday night. Clippers coach Doc Rivers debated different offensive and defensive lineups in the fourth, and finally settled on having Gilgeous-Alexander help defend James Harden. ""It was scary,"" Rivers said, at the same time explaining that he trusts all of his players. Gilgeous-Alexander's defense and his ball-handling skills give the Clippers greater options. ""We're all composed and not fazed by the moment,"" the rookie said. ""I'm always really confident in myself. I know how hard I work and it pays off."" Harrell and the bench helped the Clippers erase a four-point deficit late in the third, with Luc Mbah a Moute's 3-pointer giving them the lead for good. Tobias Harris led the Clippers with 23 points. Danilo Gallinari added 20 and Harrell had 10 rebounds. The Rockets were without Chris Paul against his old team. He began serving a two-game suspension for his involvement in an on-court fight against the Lakers on Saturday. ""You know how much we miss him, that's obvious, but still we had enough to win,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It shouldn't be an excuse. We should have played better."" Harden had 31 points and 14 assists one night after getting shoved by the Lakers' Brandon Ingram in a move that started the incident involving Paul. ""It is what it is,"" Harden said of the suspensions and fines handed down by the league. ""I don't know how to decide how many games."" Harden scored nine straight points to draw Houston within three with 29 seconds left. But his potential tying 3-pointer was short on the left side as time expired. ""He can really do everything on court so you have to try to make it difficult,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. The starless-Clippers earned their second win over one of the NBA's top teams, having beaten the Thunder without Russell Westbrook on Friday night. ""Two back-to-back really good efforts on the defensive end,"" said Lou Williams, who added 12 points. Team owner Steve Ballmer exhorted the crowd of 16,149 to ""Get up!"" during a timeout with 3:17 remaining in the game, waving his arms with a fierce look on his face. Harden was subjected to some smothering defense by Patrick Beverley in the game's opening minutes. Harden went down after inadvertently getting hit in the head by Beverley and the Rockets called timeout. Another time, Harden was on a drive to the basket when Beverley committed a hard foul that knocked down the Rockets star. Trailing by four, the Clippers closed the third on a 19-6 run to lead 93-83. Mbah a Moute had eight points and Harrell added four. Harrell tipped the ball away from P.J. Tucker on the final play and scored, drawing the foul and shimmying his way into high-fives with two courtside fans. ""That hurt us,"" D'Antoni said. ""We were guarding well up until we just had some mental lapses defensively and they took advantage of it."" Gallinari scored 11 of the Clippers' first 20 points of the third, countering Eric Gordon, who had 10 points early in the period starting in place of Paul. TIP-INS Rockets: Besides his suspension, Paul was fined a total of $491,782 for his role in the fracas. Paul wasn't at Staples Center on Sunday. ... They lost in the second game of their first back-to-back of the season. The Rockets were 10-3 in such situations last season. Clippers: They ended a two-game skid against the Rockets.","401070223"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo explains how important it was for him to play in an NBA game on Christmas Day. (1:35) NEW YORK --  Giannis Antetokounmpo was so eager to make a rim-rocking Christmas debut that he overshot the basket on his first attempt, a dunk from one side that ended with the ball all the way in the opposite corner. ""I was so excited that I went a little bit too high and I thought the rim was a foot taller,"" Antetokounmpo said. He and the Milwaukee Bucks eventually settled down and showed they belonged on the holiday stage. Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 14 rebounds, and Milwaukee celebrated its return to the Christmas schedule by beating the New York Knicks 109-95 on Tuesday. ""This is one of the highest stages,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Special teams play Christmas Day, and just it's an opportunity for us and we're really happy."" Brook Lopez scored 20 points for the Bucks, who played on Christmas for the first time since 1977. They were selected for the showcase slate of games largely because of Antetokounmpo but the timing also was perfect to show an emerging team, which improved the NBA's second-best record to 23-10. Malcolm Brogdon finished with 17 points for the Bucks, the NBA scoring leaders who bounced back from a season-low 87 points in a loss to Miami on Saturday to win for the fifth time in six games. ""People come to see Giannis play but they've got to watch all of us, so it's definitely a great opportunity for the rest of us to showcase as a team what we can do,"" Brogdon said. Rookie Kevin Knox scored 21 points for the Knicks, who have lost six straight Christmas Day games and fell to 22-31 in their NBA-record 53 appearances on the holiday. ""It's on me to stay even in this whole thing, not be up and down emotionally because I (have) to keep their spirits up,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""They feel it. They're human."" New York has lost five in a row and 10 of 11 since rallying to stun the Bucks 136-134 in overtime on Dec. 1 at Madison Square Garden. Antetokounmpo was angry that night with Knicks forward Mario Hezonja, who had dunked over him in the first quarter, then stared and stepped over him. Antetokounmpo felt it was disrespectful, vowing to punch Hezonja in the groin next time. The Greek Freak was perhaps a little too pumped for the rematch -- Brogdon grabbed the rebound of his errant dunk in the corner and fired in a 3-pointer -- but he quickly got untracked. It was only a seven-point game midway through the third quarter when Antetokounmpo began to seize control. His jumper followed by layup pushed the lead into double digits, and he scored 11 points in the Bucks' 36-point period that ended with them leading 84-68 cushion. ""We played them really (well) in the first half -- down two -- in the locker room felt pretty good,"" Knox said. ""But that third quarter, defensively, offensively, just something slips with us."" Noah Vonleh had 14 points and 15 rebounds, while Tim Hardaway Jr. had 14 points and 10 boards but shot just 4 for 18 for New York. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo was chosen Eastern Conference player of the week on Monday, the third time this season he's won the award. He was also voted the player of the month in the conference for October-November. ... The Bucks are 3-2 on Christmas. Knicks: Rookie G Allonzo Trier had eight points in 18 minutes after missing seven games with a strained left hamstring. ... Hezonja didn't play. ... The Knicks haven't won on Christmas since beating Boston in 2011 in what was the NBA season opener following the lockout. ADVANTAGE, BUCKS? Both coaches were asked about the idea that a Christmas Day game favored the visiting team, which could treat it as a regular road game while the hosts were at home, perhaps surrounded by family celebrating the holiday. Milwaukee's Mike Budenholzer dismissed the notion, saying the Bucks brought plenty of family members and had a big team dinner on Christmas Eve so they could mix basketball and the holiday. Fizdale's thoughts? ""Well, I look at this team, Milwaukee's coming in with an advantage anyway,"" he said with a laugh. ""They're a better team than us right now."" KNICKS' KNOX Knox had his third straight 20-point outing. He came in averaging 20.3 points in his previous seven games.","401070233"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden is on a roll and it's helping the Houston Rockets get on track after their terrible start to the season. Harden scored 41 points and the Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-109 on Tuesday for their seventh win in the last eight games. Harden has scored 30 points or more in a career-high seven games in a row, marking the first time a player has done that since Russell Westbrook had eight consecutive 30-point games in November 2016. He has scored at least 35 in his last five, which is the longest such streak since Carmelo Anthony did it in six games in April 2013. The Rockets won just one of their first six games this season and were 11-14 after a three-game skid in early December. Since then, powered by Harden's dominance, Houston has lost just once to improve to 18-15 and move a season-high three games above .500. ""We've had that confidence all year,"" Harden said. ""Our record isn't where we want it to be, but it's getting there. And we've got to continue to work hard every day, continue to get better and grow. We're preparing for a postseason. We're not going to be at our tip top right now."" A 3-pointer by Paul George with less than two minutes left got Oklahoma City within 4 before Harden missed a 3. Westbrook missed a shot for the Thunder, but George stole the ball from Harden and was fouled by him. George made both free throws to get the Thunder within 2 with 43.6 seconds left. Harden then drove past George and into the lane for a layup to make it 112-108 with 20.4 seconds left. Westbrook made 1 of 2 free throws to cut it to 3 with 15 seconds left, and Austin Rivers made a free throw with 7.4 seconds left to secure the win. George had 28 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder, and Westbrook added 21 points with nine rebounds and nine assists. ""We had some bad bounces which got them a couple of extra possessions which got them some open 3s,"" George said. Harden became the first player to score 40 or more points on Christmas since Kevin Durant had 44 for the Thunder in 2010. Harden's latest big game came as the Rockets played without Chris Paul, who missed his second straight game with a strained left hamstring. The 9-time All-Star is out for at least the next two weeks with the injury suffered Thursday night. ""We've got a lot of guys playing at a high level right now,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""So many guys contributed (Tuesday). Clint Capela had 16 points and tied a season high with 23 rebounds. The Rockets were up by 6 with about four minutes left when Rivers, whom they signed on Monday, hit a 3-pointer to make it 107-98. Grant scored five straight points for the Thunder, highlighted by a 3-pointer, to get Oklahoma City to within 107-103, but Rivers made another 3 to push the lead to 7 with two minutes left. ""Everybody here has welcomed me so it has been a very easy transition,"" Rivers said. ""So my whole focus has just been to play hard and just try to help them in any way I can."" Houston had a 1-point lead in the fourth when Harden re-entered the game and found Capela on consecutive possessions for dunks to make it 100-95. Eric Gordon had a layup seconds later to push the lead to 7. Harden continued the run after the timeout with a driving jump shot before the Thunder scored their first basket in more than three minutes on a layup by Grant to cut the lead to 104-97. The Thunder were up by 8 at halftime, but Houston scored the first eight points of the second half to tie it at 60 with about nine minutes remaining in the third quarter. Danuel House and P.J. Tucker made 3s in that stretch to lead the Rockets. Oklahoma City was up by 2 later in the third when the Rockets scored five quick points with a 3 from Harden to take a 73-70 lead. But George hit a 3 for the Thunder soon after that to tie it up again. That basket started a 10-2 run for Oklahoma City, which included another 3 from George that made it 80-75 with about three minutes left in the third. Houston trailed by 4 after two free throws by George late in the third, but the Rockets scored the next six points, capped by a 3 from Harden, to take an 86-84 lead with less than a minute left in the quarter. The Thunder led 88-86 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook received a technical in the second quarter for yelling at an official when he thought he was fouled on a 3-point attempt. ...  Steven Adams had 17 points and seven rebounds. ... The Thunder made nine of 30 3-pointers. Rockets: Rivers scored 10 in his Houston debut. ...

"Kyrie Irving explains what it means to play in front of family members on Christmas, and he recognizes them as a good-luck charm. (0:39) BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving extended the game with a clutch shot, then ended it with two more in overtime. Irving scored six of his 40 points in overtime, hitting back-to-back 3-pointers while leading Boston back from a five-point deficit as the Celtics beat the 76ers 121-114 on Tuesday night. ""Just competition at its highest. I love going against the best. It's not too often you get to do that in the regular season, especially on a holiday like Christmas,"" said Irving, who also pulled down 10 rebounds. ""I got to open presents with my family this morning then come into work. It was great."" It came very close to not being so great for Boston, which needed Irving's fadeaway jumper from 13-feet out to tie it at 108 with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter, forcing the OT. The Sixers, much improved from the team that lost here 105-87 in the season-opener, scored the first five points of OT, but could not stop Irving when they needed to -- again. ""There aren't many in his weight class,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""Inevitably, you've got to stop him."" Irving hit a 3-pointer with 2:01 left to put Boston up 115-114, then struck again from 30-feet with 1:29 remaining in the OT and the Celtics held on to improve to 2-0 against Philadelphia this season. Jayson Tatum and Marcus Morris scored 23 apiece for Boston and Terry Rozier had 10 points. Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 34 points, making 12 of 12 free throws, and pulled down 16 rebounds. Jimmy Butler scored 24, JJ Redick had 17 points and Ben Simmons added 11 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists for the Sixers. Simmons' two free throws with 2:15 left to put the Sixers up 114-112, but Philadelphia didn't score again. ""These are the type of games that challenge you mentally, and we made sure that we stayed with it and finished it,"" said Al Horford, who scored just four points but pulled down nine rebounds and helped mitigate the Sixers' size advantage inside. The Celtics led 57-51 at halftime, but Philadelphia used a 15-2 run in the third while shooting 60 percent in the period and led 89-86 entering the fourth. Philadelphia shot 60 percent in the third quarter, hitting five 3-pointers, and led 89-86 entering the final quarter. It stayed tight through the end of the fourth. Chandler got open for a 3-pointer with 37 seconds left and the Sixers led 108-106, then Irving pulled up for a 13-foot jumper to tie it at 108 with 20 seconds left. Redick missed a jumper just before the buzzer and the game went into OT. GETTING BETTER The Sixers-Celtics rivalry isn't quite back to where it once was, but it is getting closer. Boston beat Philadelphia 4-1 in the second round of the playoffs last season and won the first two meetings this season, although the Sixers had not yet picked up Butler in a trade with Minnesota before Boston's 105-87 win on Oct. 16. The next two meetings are in Philadelphia. ""Obviously those guys have gotten better. It's definitely tougher -- no question,"" Horford said. CLUTCH KYRIE Irving said Butler had him covered well and forced him to put some extra arch on his game-tying fadeaway at the end of the fourth. Butler agreed. ""He hit a tough shot. That's what he does. That's why he is the player that he is,"" Butler said. LACK OF OTs: This was only the second game on Christmas Day since 2004 that went to overtime. Miami's win over New Orleans in 2015 was the only other one. TIP-INS: 76ers: Wilson Chandler returned after missing Saturday's win over Toronto with a left quad contusion.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  LeBron James prides himself in his durability, being available night after night, game after grueling game. That's why the Lakers star is so mad he got hurt. The Los Angeles Lakers lost LeBron in the third quarter to a strained left groin then went out and beat the two-time defending champions without him Tuesday night, getting King James' 17 points, 13 rebounds and five assists before the injury in a surprising 127-101 rout of the Golden State Warriors. ""I take a lot of pride in it,"" James said of always playing. ""That's why it (angered me) not to be able to go back into the game. It's more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That's something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it's not a long thing."" James grabbed at his left groin area with 7:51 left in the third after slipping under the Warriors' basket while trying for a loose ball. He tried to stretch it out, awkwardly walked toward the Lakers bench trying to loosen up before leaving on his own though gingerly out the tunnel for the locker room. ""I wasn't able to go back into the game, obviously. I'll get an MRI tomorrow and see what's up,"" James said. ""With me with injuries, I'm never too concerned about them. I was able to walk off on my own power. I felt a pop, see if I could stretch it a few times, see if it would relieve but it didn't. ... I did a couple exercises to see if I could continue to go but I didn't feel like it would benefit my team or me. So I came back and got a jump start on the rehab."" He is scheduled for an MRI exam Wednesday and coach Luke Walton is preparing to be without James on Thursday night in Sacramento. James has played in 156 straight games overall and 116 in the regular season. And he's not about to guess whether he will have to miss time. Stephen Curry made consecutive 3s shortly after James exited, and the Warriors got within 78-76 at the 2:48 mark of the third -- but Kyle Kuzma and the persistent Lakers stayed at it every possession. Curry wound up with 15 points but the home fans had seen enough well before the final buzzer and headed out for the rest of Christmas. ""They played like they had nothing to lose. They played like they had a free swing,"" Curry said. ""Everybody who touched the ball was aggressive. They just had a different look in their eye and we weren't able to match that. They went out and won the game, that's basically it."" Kuzma contributed 19 points with a pretty baseline 3 late, Ivica Zubac had 18 points and 11 rebounds and Rajon Rondo 15 points and 10 assists off the bench as the Lakers snapped an 11-game losing streak on the Warriors' home floor since a 118-115 overtime win Dec. 22, 2012. Los Angeles also ended a seven-game skid overall in the rivalry with its first win in the series since March 6, 2016. James made it look easy early on shooting over Jonas Jerebko and Kevon Looney. James hit a turnaround jumper at the 4:39 mark of the second quarter to put the Lakers ahead 52-37 and L.A. led 65-50 at the break. It was James' second straight Christmas game at Oracle Arena after playing here with the Cavaliers last year and losing 99-92. Walton -- a former Warriors top assistant and dear friend of Steve Kerr -- got some time with his Hall of Fame dad, Bill, before the game and a few moments to catch up with Curry and share holiday greetings in the hallway after the two-time MVP's warmup routine. Kevin Durant, playing on a tender left ankle, had 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Andre Iguodala came off the bench and made his initial five shots and 7 of 9 by halftime on the way to a season-high 23 points while also handling some of the load defending James. Golden State shot just 9 for 36 from deep, Curry going 2 of 8 and Durant 3 for 8. MCGEE's RING DELAYED Lakers center JaVale McGee was still sick with a respiratory infection and missed his fifth straight game, didn't travel and missed his scheduled moment to receive his championship ring. That will now happen Feb. 2 when the Lakers return to Oracle Arena. McGee was one of three big men who rotated in Steve Kerr's rotation on the way to a repeat title. ""I'm happy for JaVale. He's getting more of a chance to play with the Lakers than he did with us,"" Kerr said. ""We had a lot of centers play a really important role for us the last couple of years. He was fantastic and we loved having him here. Wish he was here and that we could give him his ring today, but we'll do it next time. Very happy for him and his success this year."" TIP-INS Lakers: Zubac shot 9 for 10. ... The Lakers had lost three of four, so this meant a lot. ... Los Angeles improved to 5-6 on the road vs. the Western Conference. ... Tyson Chandler, who had been questionable with back spasms after he missed Sunday's game against Memphis, returned and played 15-plus minutes. Warriors:  Iguodala reached double figures for the fourth time this season. ... Curry and Draymond Green each picked up two early fouls, and Green fouled out with 5:36 left. He was limited to four points, five assists and five rebounds.","401070236"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Tough defense has reemerged as a staple for Utah. It starts with Rudy Gobert. Gobert has seemingly regained the edge he possessed last season when he won NBA Defensive Player of the Year honors. His attitude and energy is spreading to his teammates and turning the Jazz into a nightmare matchup for most opponents once again. Gobert totaled 18 points, 14 rebounds and a season-high seven blocks to lead Utah to a 117-96 victory over Portland on Tuesday night. He spearheaded a defensive effort that resulted in the Trail Blazers shooting just 39 percent from the floor and become the 11th Jazz opponent to fail to reach 100 points this season. ""Our mindset has changed over the last few games,"" Gobert said. ""We want to play defense and we're having fun playing defense. It changes the way we play."" Gobert's seven blocks were three more than his previous season-high, which he tallied on four occasions. The Jazz center described himself as giving 200 percent in the game and Utah coach Quin Snyder felt like Gobert made his presence felt over the entire court. ""It's what we need from him,"" Snyder said. ""He can still protect the rim and also be impactful on the floor."" Donovan Mitchell added 19 points for Utah. Joe Ingles chipped in 15 points, seven rebounds, and five assists for the Jazz. Utah (17-18) won for the fifth time in their last six home games while shooting 55 percent from the floor. The Jazz have won 10 of 11 games this season where they have shot 50 percent or better as a team. Damian Lillard score 20 points to lead Portland. Evan Turner added 12 points off the bench. The Blazers (19-15) lost to Utah for the second time in five days after trailing nearly the entire second half by a double digit margin. ""They're a really good defensive team,"" Lillard said. ""They make you work on the offensive end. You got to compete on the offensive end."" Jae Crowder scored seven of Utah's first nine second-quarter points, starting with the team's first 3-pointer of the game, to cap a 9-0 run that gave the Jazz a 33-26 lead. The Blazers pulled within three on three different occasions. Lillard hit a couple of baskets to cut the deficit to a basket, then fed Jusuf Nurkic for a layup to trim Utah's lead to 43-40. The Jazz pulled away before halftime behind hot shooting from the perimeter. Ingles and Crowder buried back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a 16-5 run. Mitchell finished it off by beating the shot clock with another outside basket, giving the Jazz a 59-45 lead. Utah went 5-of-7 from 3-point range in the second quarter after going 0-of-8 in the first quarter. ""We know how we want to score and how we want to attack these guys,"" Crowder said. ""We believe in our shots. We believe in the work we put in."" The Jazz extended their lead to 68-51 on back-to-back baskets from Ricky Rubio early in the third quarter. Portland chipped away at the lead and finally cut it to 92-83 on a floater from Seth Curry early in the fourth quarter. That's as close as the Blazers got. Gobert answered with a dunk to push Utah's lead back to double digits. It sparked a 14-2 run that slammed the door shut on any potential comeback. Mitchell punctuated the run with a 3-pointer, putting the Jazz up 106-85 with 4:49 remaining. Mitchell thinks Utah is ready to turn the corner heading into the new year because the team is learning how to finish games defensively. ""We've been in this situation at the beginning of the year and we didn't have a counter-punch,"" Mitchell said. ""Now we're adjusting and making that counter-punch. It's similar to what we had last year. And we have more. We have more to us."" CHRISTMAS CAMEO Playing on Christmas day is a rare occurrence for Utah. The Jazz played for just the seventh time on Dec. 25 and improved to 5-2 on the holiday. Their previous game on the holiday came in 1997 when John Stockton scored 24 points to lead the Jazz to a 107-103 victory over Houston. SHUT DOWN C.J. McCollum finished with only 11 points on 4-of-14 shooting against the Jazz. McCollum came into the game averaging 19.8 points in his last four games against Utah. The veteran guard has scored at least 20 points in 154 games since the start of the 2015-16 season, which is the 13th most in the NBA in that span. QUOTABLE ""He affects shots and his presence affects shots,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts on Gobert's play keeping the Blazers from finishing at the rim. TIP INS Blazers: Lillard did not attempt a free throw. He came into the game ranked fourth in the NBA in free throws made and eighth in the league in attempts. ... Portland scored 14 points off 17 Utah turnovers. ... The Blazers made just 35 baskets against the Jazz for the second time this season. Jazz: Gobert has logged a double-double in nine of his last 10 games against the Blazers. ... Dante Exum matched his season-high with 15 points off the bench. ... Utah shot 13-of-21 (61.9 percent) from 3-point range over the final three quarters.","401070237"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Jahlil Okafor stepped into the starting lineup for the injured Anthony Davis and had his best game of the season. Okafor scored a season-high 20 points, matched a season best with 10 rebounds and added two blocks to help the balanced New Orleans Pelicans beat the reeling Memphis Grizzlies 105-85 on Monday. The Pelicans played their first game since announcing Davis would miss 1-2 weeks with a left index finger sprain. Okafor filled in nicely. ""My teammates were very supportive of me, rooting me on, cheering me on, talking to me on the bench. That made my job real easy,"" Okafor said. Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic scored 21 points each and Julius Randle had 20 for New Orleans, which snapped a two-game skid. The Pelicans put the game away in the second half, outscoring Memphis 51-35, including a 13-1 rally late in the third. New Orleans shot 51 percent in the final two quarters and made 8 of 14 from outside the arc after a poor-shooting first half from 3-point range. ""That second half, third quarter was huge for us after I made a couple of 3s,"" said Mirotic, who was 4 of 8 from outside the arc in the second half. ""When we play this way unselfishly, everything is easier."" Despite Davis' absence and his 13.3 rebounds a game, the Pelicans dominated the boards 50-35. Meanwhile, Memphis has lost six straight and 12 of 13. Several games ago, the theme of the skid was frustration; Monday it was humiliation, particularly since the game was part of the city's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day festivities. ""It's really embarrassing on a day like today that I think is very special to all of us,"" said point guard Mike Conley, who had 20 points and eight assists for Memphis. ""For us to play the way we did -- especially in the second half -- is unacceptable."" The Grizzlies have injury problems, and there has been drama from locker-room scuffles to jettisoning high-paid, oft-injured Chandler Parsons from the team. ""We're kind of beat,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of the Memphis malaise. ""We allow one play to impact the next play and then it impacts the next play. The next thing you know, it's one of those runs that are happening."" Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 22 points, as Memphis was limited to 38 percent shooting in the game, after making 10 of 20 in the first quarter. TIP-INS Pelicans: Played the final game of a five-game trip. ... Have played three times in Memphis on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. ... Okafor started his fourth game of the season. ... New Orleans was 1 of 12 on 3-pointers in the first half, but finished the game 9 of 26. ... Okafor's previous season high was 17 points against Milwaukee on Dec. 19. ... Double-doubles by Okafor, Holiday and Randle marked the 11th time this season three New Orleans players recorded double-doubles. It was Okafor's first double-double since Feb. 25, 2017. Grizzlies: Are now 7-10 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. ... Played the opening game of a season-high five-game homestand. ... Gasol returned after missing the Grizzlies' loss Saturday in Toronto with back soreness. ... F Omri Casspi was a late scratch (illness). MLK HONOREES Former stars Chris Bosh, Wayne Embry, Candace Parker and Bill Walton were honored during the day's festivities as this year's 14th Annual National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award winners. The quartet was selected for its ""dedicated and significant contributions to civil and human rights and for laying the foundation for future leaders through their career in sports in the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.""","401070238"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid relished the chance to face James Harden, and wasn't going to let a little back tightness stop him. Embiid had 32 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers past fellow MVP contender Harden and the Houston Rockets 121-93 on Monday night. ""I love playing against guys you guys say are better than me,"" Embiid said. Harden, selected Western Conference player of the week earlier in the day, finished with 37 points -- giving him 20 straight games with at least 30. Philadelphia played without four-time All-Star Jimmy Butler (sore right wrist), and Embiid more than made up for his absence. ""It was really fun for us,"" Embiid said. ""Don't think it was fun for them."" Embiid was questionable before the game with lower back soreness and coach Brett Brown hinted during pregame it might be best for the Philadelphia big man to sit this one out. Embiid clearly had other intentions. ""I want to fight with my teammates,"" he said. ""Whatever I have to do, I'll do for my team."" His 24 first-half points helped Philadelphia to a 65-50 halftime lead, and he punctuated an entertaining opening 24 minutes by pinning Harden's layup attempt with 7.5 seconds left for a crowd-pleasing block. The duo had to be separated with 38.7 seconds left in the half, with each being issued a technical, after Harden took exception to Embiid's foul on him. The 76ers broke the game open in a dominant third quarter as they outscored Houston 29-13 to take a 94-63 advantage into the fourth. Ben Simmons stole Harden's pass, made a layup and finished a three-point play after being fouled by Harden to make it 73-52. The lead kept growing, getting as large as 31. ""We were due for a game like this,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. Harden had 10 points in the third but missed four of six field goal tries as the 76ers hounded him defensively with double-teams and different looks. A tired-looking Harden's air ball with 12.3 seconds left in the third showed the effects of the Philadelphia defense -- and, perhaps, Harden's offensive workload. With the game out of range, Harden sat in the fourth. ""This is not a great way to rest him, but we rested him today,"" D'Antoni said. BREWER'S DEFENSE Corey Brewer frustrated Harden for part of the night. On a 10-day contract, Brewer replaced Butler in the starting lineup and was tasked with guarding Harden. Brewer was a gnat for the first 24 minutes, following Harden wherever he went. Harden took exception to Brewer guarding him without the ball 80 feet from the basket, pushing the 76ers forward behind the play. Harden wasn't called for a foul on that play, but picked up his third with 29.1 seconds left in the first half when he shoved Brewer away -- again causing the sold-out crowd to erupt in cheers. Brewer is happy to be back in uniform and making an impact. ""I get to play basketball,"" he said. ""I was sitting home playing with my kids, playing superheroes every day."" ANTHONY TRADE A person with direct knowledge of the matter said the Rockets are trading Carmelo Anthony and an undisclosed amount of cash to the Bulls in a deal that is expected to be completed Tuesday. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday because the trade still needs league approval. The Bulls have no plans to play Anthony and will look to either trade him before the Feb. 7 deadline or ultimately waive him and make him a free agent. The trade ends a short-lived saga in Houston for Anthony, who averaged 13.4 points in 10 games with the Rockets. He has not played since Nov. 8. FARIED SIGNED Houston signed Kenneth Faried before the game after he was waived by the Nets on Saturday. In 12 games with Brooklyn this season, Faried averaged 5.1 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. ""He brings energy, athleticism and runs the floor,"" D'Antoni said. ""The way we play will complement him, and he'll complement us."" In order to sign Faried, the Rockets waived James Nunnally. Faried had 13 points and six rebounds in 23 minutes. TIP-INS Rockets: G Chris Paul (strained left hamstring) missed his 15th straight game. G Brandon Knight (sore left knee) also sat out. C Clint Capela (right thumb surgery) is out four to six weeks. ... Houston was held under 100 points for the 10th time, dropping to 2-8 in those games. 76ers: Philadelphia improved to 20-4 at home. ... Landry Shamet had 18 points and JJ Redick added 16.","401070239"
"LOS ANGELES --  Nothing could stop Klay Thompson, certainly not the Lakers' defense. The Golden State Warriors made sure of it, too, setting screens and calling plays for the star guard, who tied an NBA record by making his first 10 attempts from 3-point range on his way to scoring 44 points in a 130-111 victory Monday night. ""I've never hit 10 3s in a row in a game. That's hard to do,"" Thompson said. ""I just happened to be on tonight and I'm happy I was able to do it in front of my family."" The Warriors equaled a season high with their eighth consecutive victory. The two-time defending champions won their seventh straight road game, too. ""They're starting to find their stride, not just against us, but against the league,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. Thompson stopped and popped from everywhere, finishing 10 of 11 from beyond the arc and 17 of 20 from the floor overall. ""We kind of sold out to look for Klay, to be honest,"" Kevin Durant said. ""When you're knocking shots down like that, you have to continue to feed him until he goes cold and tonight I didn't see that in sight."" Thompson had 23 points in the third quarter, connecting on seven 3s as the Warriors stretched their lead to 36. He hopped and let his right arm hang in the air after hitting his seventh while Golden State fans at Staples Center cheered. He finally missed from deep late in the period. ""We had two, three guys flying at him,"" Walton said. Durant added 20 points and Stephen Curry had 11 points and 12 assists, going 2 of 10 from 3-point range for the Warriors. ""We had 41 assists tonight, so the ball was moving and Klay was just spectacular,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Emblematic of his quiet offensive night, Curry came dribbling in alone for a fast-break dunk, but slipped and fell, drawing gasps from the crowd. He scrambled to his feet, got the ball back and put up an air ball. ""That was funny,"" Thompson said. ""That'll definitely be on `Shaqtin a Fool."" Ivica Zubac led Los Angeles with 18 points. Brandon Ingram added 17 and Kyle Kuzma had 16. The Lakers were without their primary ball-handlers and playmakers in LeBron James, Lonzo Ball and Rajon Rondo. They fell to 5-9 without James, whose left groin strain has forced him out for the longest stretch of his 16-year career. Coming off a split in two straight overtime games, the Lakers kept it close in the first half, trailing 65-55 at the break. Golden State had just six 3s at halftime. But Thompson fired up a 3-pointer -- the first of Golden State's nine in the third quarter -- and the Warriors went on to outscore the Lakers 45-25 to lead 110-80 going into the fourth. Golden State's sharpshooting silenced the crowd and allowed the Warriors to sit four of their five starters in the fourth, leaving DeMarcus Cousins in for a bit until he also went to the bench. Cousins had eight points, nine rebounds, five assists and four fouls in his second game for the Warriors since being out nearly a year with a severe knee injury. The Warriors have made 141 3-pointers to 93 for opponents during their eight-game winning streak. TIP-INS Warriors: All 12 players scored. ... Their other eight-game winning streak this season was Oct. 22 to Nov. 5. ... Evened the season series 1-1, having lost 127-101 on Christmas. Lakers: Walton hopes James is able to return this week when the Lakers have five straight games at Staples Center. ... Ball is out four to six weeks with a left ankle sprain. ... Walton said Rondo (right ring finger surgery) could return on Thursday, but he's not as confident about James. ... Josh Hart had six points, one assist and four fouls starting in place of Ball. ... Jack Nicholson made a rare courtside appearance. Mahershala Ali, Snoop Dogg, James Franco, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao were in the crowd. PLEASING THE PARENTS Thompson was going to catch up with his father, former Laker Mychal Thompson, afterward. ""He'll probably just tell me, `Good job, should have had 50. Should have gone for 50,"" the younger Thompson said. ""It's never good enough for your parents."" BELL VS KERR Warriors reserve Jordan Bell had a sideline exchange with Kerr. Bell scored two points in seven minutes. ""Coach will always, especially the younger guys in the league, definitely be on them a little bit more because he expects a lot out of them,"" Durant said. ""He lets us know what he sees out there and if you have something to say to him back, he's not going to be afraid to go back at you. He sees the potential in him. That stuff happens, so we'll move on.""","401070240"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Tony Parker said he'd never seen anything like it in his 18 seasons in the NBA. The Charlotte Hornets went small ball -- like really, really small ball -during a stretch to start the fourth quarter and nearly overcame a 20-point deficit before falling 113-112 to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. Antetokounmpo had 25 points, 18 rebounds and eight assists and made two free throws with 23.7 seconds left for the go-ahead score as the Bucks held off late rally and a 41-point performance from Hornets point guard Kemba Walker to earn the win. ""We can't give them the chance to believe that they can come back, they have a great team they have guys that can knock down 3's and get the crowd into it and comeback,"" Antetokounmpo said. Hornets first-year coach James Borrego turned to what Parker called an ""unorthodox approach"" with his team down 10 entering the fourth quarter. He sent out a lineup that included the 6-foot-1 Walker, Parker (6-2), Malik Monk (6-3), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (6-7) and Nic Batum (6-8). Kidd-Gilchrist and Batum, who were guards last season, spent time covering Antetokounmpo on defense. And it worked. Led by Walker, the Hornets caught fire from the outside and got easy looks in transition. They stuck with it for most of the fourth quarter and took their only lead of the game with 36.3 seconds on a pair of free throws by Walker. But Walker missed a driving layup with 3.4 seconds left. The loose ball got kicked outside, where Batum misfired on a 3-pointer from the left wing at the buzzer. ""That lineup was small, super small,"" Parker said with a laugh. ""But we came back."" Walker said he had never played with a unit that small before. Batum laughed and said it was the first time he's ever played center. ""We tried to counter and go big and there were some possessions where big looked good,"" said Bucks new coach Mike Budenholzer. ""But then I think we lost track of some shooters."" When asked if that type of lineup is sustainable, Parker said, ""It depends on the matchups. Some nights we can do it. Some nights we won't be able to do it."" TIP INS Bucks: Khris Middleton had 19 points and Eric Bledsoe added 17 as the Bucks set out on the quest to reach the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons. ... Brook Lopez 14 points in his debut for the Bucks after signing a one-year contract in the offseason. Hornets: Malik Monk had 18 points, while Parker had eight points and seven assists in his first game with the Hornets after 17 seasons with the Spurs. BUCKS SHOOTING: Budenholzer stressed spacing and perimeter shooting to open up more 1-on-1 opportunities for the 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo to drive the lane. It certainly opened up some 3-point chances as the Bucks used that spacing to knock down 11 of 22 3-point attempts in the first half to build a 67-54 halftime lead. ""Love the way we started the game, loved the way we played a lot in the first half, just got to find a way to do that for 48 minutes,"" Budenholzer said. WALKER BUMMED Despite setting a franchise record for points scored in a season opener, Walker was mad at himself after the game for missing the potential winning layup. ""I just missed it,"" Walker said. ""I took my eyes off the rim. I'm (upset). It's going to eat me up tonight."" But Eric Bledsoe, who covered Walker most of the game, was certainly impressed with the two-time All-Star's effort. ""He had what, 41 points?  I guess I didn't do too good"" guarding him, Bledsoe joked. ""He's a tough guard man.  I thought everybody locked in on him down the stretch and kind of helped me out a little bit.  It's a team game."" CELEBRATING 30 YEARS Charlotte wore its throwback white jerseys with pinstripes and they celebrated 30 years of basketball. Several members of the original 1988-89 team were introduced before the game, including Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry, Rex Chapman and Kelly Tripucka.","401070693"
"DETROIT --  It took the Detroit Pistons over three minutes to score in their first game under new coach Dwane Casey. Then at the end, they committed two straight shot-clock violations while trying to close out the victory. After all that, the Pistons won anyway. ""We'll take it,"" Casey said. ""In this league, you've got to celebrate the wins. I've said it all along. We've got to have fun. We can't have the gloom-and-doom situations. There's going to be adversity in the NBA."" Andre Drummond had 24 points and 20 rebounds, and Detroit won its opener under Casey, 103-100 over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. Blake Griffin added 26 points for the Pistons, who were without two potential starters but still managed to hold off Brooklyn. Caris LeVert equaled a career high with 27 points for the Nets, and he drove to the basket in the final seconds with Brooklyn down one. LeVert lost the ball, and it went out of bounds to Detroit. ""There were too many bodies in the lane, and I should have backed it out and got us a better look,"" LeVert said. ""I needed to slow down, but I gave them a chance to knock the ball away."" Reggie Jackson made two free throws for the Pistons with 6.2 seconds remaining, and Joe Harris missed a 3-pointer from near the top of the key at the other end. The Pistons hired Casey this offseason after moving on from Stan Van Gundy, and his debut began inauspiciously. The Nets scored the game's first eight points, and Brooklyn's Jarrett Allen made an impressive defensive play early when he blocked Griffin's dunk attempt. The Nets led by as many as 12 points in the first quarter, but it was tied at 51 at halftime. ""That first quarter was scary,"" Drummond said. ""You know, had first-game jitters. ... We were a little all over the place in the beginning."" Detroit opened a 13-point lead in the third quarter, but then it was Brooklyn's turn to rally. The Pistons led 101-96 when Spencer Dinwiddie went to the line for the Nets. Dinwiddie made a free throw but missed the second. Brooklyn came up with the rebound, and Harris made a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to one. The Pistons then committed a shot clock violation, but Allen missed at the other end. After another shot clock violation, LeVert tried his drive toward the basket but came up empty. The Pistons were without Stanley Johnson (toe) and Reggie Bullock (illness). Brooklyn was not at full strength, either. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was out because of a left adductor injury. The Nets lost their sixth straight season opener. TRIBUTE The Pistons honored Aretha Franklin before the game by playing a recording of her singing the national anthem. Former Pistons star Isiah Thomas spoke briefly, asking for a moment of silence for Franklin, who died in August. After the moment of silence, and with no additional announcement, a recording of Franklin singing the anthem at the 2004 NBA Finals began playing while pictures scrolled on the scoreboard screen. A microphone was left unattended at midcourt while the anthem played. TOUGH STRETCH Detroit went on a 20-4 run in the third quarter and led 73-60 after a 3-pointer by Jackson. ""I thought the third quarter, that's where we kind of lost it,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We turned the ball over a bunch, they got out and ran, and that's where they got their separation."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn was also without DeMarre Carroll (right ankle), Allen Crabbe (left ankle), Shabazz Napier (right hamstring) and Alan Williams (left ankle). ... Dinwiddie had 23 points. Pistons: Jackson scored 19 points. ... Drummond made a 3-pointer , the sixth of his career.","401070694"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan kept asking his team to focus on defense and rebounding during the offseason. He witnessed the results of both Wednesday night. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 points, Victor Oladipo added 16 and the Pacer blew past the Memphis Grizzlies for a 111-83 victory -- the largest opening-night victory margin in the Pacers' NBA era. The previous mark of 27 was set against the then New Jersey Nets in 1985. ""I like our effort,"" McMillan said. ""I thought defensively we were really good, only 16 points in the paint. I thought every guy that went out on the floor played hard. The intensity didn't drop off on the defensive end of the floor. I just really liked our effort and our execution, playing the game together."" It showed. While seven Pacers players scored in double figures, Indiana delivered the knockout blows by excelling in the areas McMillan stressed throughout training camp and the preseason. Memphis shot just 29.8 percent from the field and had only four players in double figures, led by Marc Gasol with 13 points. And Indiana outrebounded the Grizzlies 57-28 including 15 from Domantas Sabonis who also scored 14 points. The Pacers wound up with their best rebounding margin in five years -- and that was all it took on a night the Pacers never trailed despite going 10 of 26 on 3-pointers and committing 20 turnovers. Indiana has won seven of its eight last season openers and eight of its last nine home openers. The Pacers figure it's just a start. ""We've just got to build on it,"" said Oladipo, who was held without a steal for the first time in 64 games. ""It was a great first game, a great first outing, and now we've just got to build on it."" Clearly, it's not what Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff envisioned in his debut as a full-time head coach after twice serving on an interim basis, most recently last season in Memphis. ""We are a much better basketball team than we showed tonight,"" he said. ""We still believe that and we've just got to be better all around."" Indiana jumped to a 26-16 lead after one quarter, then used a 14-2 second-quarter run to make it 41-17. Memphis closed to 56-39 at the half and cut the deficit to 14 twice in the third quarter, but the Pacers fended off the finally charge with 9-3 run to rebuild a 73-53 lead and never let the Grizzlies get closer than 18 the rest of the game. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Rookie Jaren Jackson Jr., who grew up in nearby Carmel, Indiana, scored 10 points in his NBA debut. ... Memphis had only seven turnovers. ... Gasol appeared to hurt his right leg during the second quarter but returned before halftime and played throughout the second half before Bickerstaff pulled his starters late in the game.. Pacers: Indiana has won three straight over the Grizzlies. ... Doug McDermott had 12 points, Cory Joseph finished with 11 and Thaddeus Young wound up with 10 points and eight rebounds. ... TJ Leaf, Indiana's first-round draft pick in 2017, left late in the first quarter with a sprained left ankle and did not return. NO LIMITS All indications are that Mike Conley's recovery from an injured left heel has gone smoothly. After missing 70 games last season, the Indianapolis high school star returned to his hometown and made his first regular-season appearance since November. He played nearly 29 minutes, scored 11 points and had three assists and one steal. And there's no limitation on Conley's playing time. ""We'll be mindful of the amount of minutes he's played over his career,"" Bickerstaff said. ""But he hasn't missed a day of camp, he hasn't missed a rep, so he's ready to go."" NEW SPOT Tyreke Evans' solid debut with his new team came at the expense of his former team. He scored 14 points and had six assists for the Pacers as McMillan tries to determine how best Evans fits in Indiana's rotation. ""He's trying to see what we want him to do and I'm trying to see how we can use him,"" McMillan said. ""It's going to take some time, but I think he's a guy who has some versatility, who can play the one, two or three and we're certainly going to give him the ball and let him create.""","401070695"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Mohamed Bamba made a big impact in his first NBA game. Orlando's 7-foot rookie dunked twice and blocked a shot during a 9-0 fourth quarter run, and the Magic held on for a 104-101 win over the Miami Heat in the season opener for both teams Wednesday night. ""I was so nervous going out there, but it was everything that I expected. It was a fun game to play in,"" said Bamba, who came off the bench for 13 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in 25 minutes. ""It's just a matter of doing that 81 more times."" Aaron Gordon had 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Magic, who went without a field goal over the final 4 1/2 minutes. Goran Dragic led Miami with 26 points and Josh Richardson added 21. With the Magic leading 86-81 early in the fourth quarter, Bamba swatted away a shot by Richardson, and Terrence Ross got his hands on two more Heat shots during Miami's scoreless stretch of nearly four minutes. Bamba dunked in two Orlando misses, and Jerian Grant hit a jumper to lift the Magic to a 92-81 lead with 7:50 remaining. Richardson, Dragic and backup center Bam Adebayo rallied the Heat in the closing minutes, and after the Magic missed three free throws in the final seconds, Miami had a chance to win. But Richardson dribbled out of bounds before Evan Fournier hit two free throws with 1.6 seconds left for the game's final points. ""If I had a little more space on the baseline, I was going to attack, probably spin and make something happen, but I ran out of real estate,"" Richardson said. ""I've just got to make a better play."" The Heat started well and ended with a rally. But after making 11 of their first 20 shots, they finished the game shooting just 39 percent (38-for-97). ""We had a tough time creating looks the way we wanted to, but you have to credit their defense,"" sad Miami coach Eric Spoelstra. ""They're long, they do a really good job of protecting the paint."" Miami led 28-14 after Richardson's 3-pointer late in the first quarter. A 3-pointer by Nik Vucevich gave Orlando its first lead at 37-36, and the Magic led 54-51 at halftime in spite of Dragic's 16 points and Fournier's 0-for-5 from behind the 3-point line. The Magic's bench (Bamba, Ross, Grant and Jonathon Simmons) contributed 36 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocks. ""Offensively, we were here and there, but the story of the game was the bench,"" said Magic coach Steve Clifford. ""When they went in the game they picked up our defense and we played offense off our defense, which is something you have to do earlier in the year."" FINAL RUN FOR WADE Dwayne Wade entered his 16th and final NBA season at the 8:22 mark of the first quarter and played 26 minutes, finishing with nine points and 11 rebounds. ""I'm not going to play him playoff minutes, or anywhere near that, right now,"" said Spoelstra. ""He knows how to approach an 82-game season even better than I do."" BIG STEPS UP? While declining to predict a number of wins, Clifford said a ""realistic goal"" is to finish among the NBA's top 10 in defense and top 15 in offense in points per possession. Orlando was 21st and 24th, respectively, in those categories last season. TIP-INS Heat: F Justise Winslow (hamstring), G Wayne Ellington (ankle), G Dion Waiters (ankle) and F James Johnson (hernia) did not play and are not expected to play Thursday night. Magic: The Magic made 7-of-25 3-point shots and missed 12 free throws. . ... Orlando is 52-64 all-time against its intrastate rival, but has won 7 of the last 11.","401070696"
"NEW YORK --  The nervous Knicks had missed their first nine shots and just needed somebody to make one to get them started. Turned out to be a fan. And once he made a halfcourt shot, the basket really opened up for Tim Hardaway Jr. and the Knicks. ""I think that might have been the reason we turned the game around,"" coach David Fizdale said. Hardaway scored 31 points, sparking the Knicks during their franchise-record, 49-point second quarter, and New York beat the Atlanta Hawks 126-107 on Wednesday night in their first game under Fizdale. Hardaway had 16 points in the period, when the Knicks matched the Hawks' point total for the entire first half. New York led 72-49 at the break. Trae Young finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists, shooting 5 for 14 in his NBA debut. Taurean Prince scored 21 points for the Hawks, who were overwhelmed in their first game under Lloyd Pierce. ""Definitely some things that we haven't been doing coming from preseason,"" Young said. ""But this is just one game, so I am not too worried."" Four other Knicks scored at least 15 points, including rookie Allonzo Trier, who had such a powerful third-quarter dunk that Fizdale apologized for celebrating too much. Rookie Kevin Knox finished with 10 and was just 4 for 16. Hardaway and the Knicks started slowly, as he had missed his first four shots and the Knicks took a timeout trailing 10-2. During that break, George Holmes of Northport, New York, nailed a halfcourt shot to win $10,000, and suddenly the New Yorkers couldn't miss. ""He made that basket a little bit more bigger for us going out of that timeout and I thank him,"" Hardaway said. Frank Ntilikina made a 3-pointer out of the timeout to get the Knicks started on a 12-0 run and then they really took off in the second quarter. That was especially true of Hardaway, who made his next eight shots against his former team. He fell seven points shy of Patrick Ewing's franchise record for opening night, and perhaps could have gotten closer if he needed to play more of the fourth quarter. Young, the No. 5 pick in the draft and the first player to lead the nation in scoring and assists in the same season as a freshman at Oklahoma, said he felt butterflies Wednesday. He recalled that he shot airballs on his first shot in high school, college and Summer League, saying he wanted to avoid that again. He did, knocking down his first shot as a pro, a runner in the lane late in the first quarter. But he missed his other six shots in the first half and the Hawks were outscored by 19 points in his 17 minutes before halftime. TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce congratulated Hawks radio play-by-play voice Steve Holman for working his 2,500th game, counting playoffs, Wednesday. Holman started his career with the team in March 1989. ... Atlanta plays its first three games on the road before facing Dallas in its home opener next Wednesday. Knicks: The Knicks' record for any quarter is 53 points in the fourth quarter against Seattle on Dec. 26, 1967. ... The Knicks opened at home for the first time since the 2014-15 season. OPENING-NIGHT OLD-TIMER Vince Carter began his 21st season by starting at forward and scoring 12 points. Pierce said the Hawks' research Wednesday found that only Robert Parish was an older opening-night NBA starter than the 41-year-old Carter. He stands out so much on a young Atlanta team that the Hawks' average NBA experience drops from 3.65 years to 2.63 if Carter is excluded. FRIENDS AND FOES Fizdale and Pierce played against each other in college, when Fizdale was a senior at San Diego during Pierce's freshman season for West Coast Conference rival Santa Clara. ""Lloyd caught a lob on my head from Steve Nash once,"" Fizdale recalled. ""I still haven't forgave him for that but we've been friends a long time and this is obviously for both of us a big moment.""","401070697"
"TORONTO -- Kawhi Leonard helped the Toronto Raptors extend their success in season-opening games. Leonard had 24 points and 12 rebounds in his Toronto debut, Kyle Lowry scored 27 points and the Raptors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 116-104 on Wednesday night, extending their streak of opening-night victories to six. ""I felt good,"" Leonard said. ""I'm happy we came out and got a win. I came out of the game healthy, so it's a win-win for me."" Acquired from the Spurs in a July blockbuster that sent four-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio, Leonard was introduced to a thunderous ovation, the final Raptors starter to have his name announced to the capacity crowd of 19,915. ""It was great,"" Leonard said. ""They gave me some more energy."" Leonard played 37 minutes in his first competitive game since January with the Spurs. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was limited to nine games last season because of a quadriceps injury. ""It's fun to watch [him], it's fun to play with [him],"" said guard Danny Green, who was traded to Toronto along with Leonard. ""I'm happy for him, that he's playing again."" Fred VanVleet scored 14 points, Pascal Siakam had 13 and Green 11 as the Raptors gave Nick Nurse a victory in his first game as head coach. ""It's pretty cool,"" Nurse said. ""It's good to get it done. It was a little bit nerve-wracking there toward the end."" Lowry led Toronto with eight assists and shot 5-for-6 from 3-point range. ""Kyle was awesome tonight,"" Nurse said. Toronto is the first team since Miami from 2011 through 2016 to win six straight season openers. Kevin Love scored 21 points and Cedi Osman had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Cavaliers. ""From the jump, our execution wasn't there,"" Love said. Cleveland knocked Toronto out of the playoffs in each of the past three seasons, but faces a struggle this season now that former star LeBron James is with the Los Angeles Lakers. Jordan Clarkson and George Hill each scored 15 points and Rodney Hood had 12 for the Cavaliers, who trailed by as many as 20. Cleveland had won 15 of the previous 17 meetings between the teams, including 10 straight postseason games. ""We didn't play well but they had something to do with that,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said of Toronto. ""This is going to be a top team in the East, a top 1- or 2-seed."" Leonard missed his first three shot attempts but made three of his next four to score a team-high six points in the opening quarter. Lowry and Siakam each scored five in the first as Toronto led 28-25 after one. Leonard added six more points in the second quarter and Lowry had five as Toronto made five of 10 from 3-point range to open a 60-47 lead at halftime. Lowry and Leonard each scored nine points in the third, with Lowry making three from long range, as Toronto took a 90-75 lead into the fourth. QUOTABLE A Raptors assistant the past five seasons, Nurse cracked a joke when asked before the game about his journey to becoming a head coach. ""For five years, I had a thousand people telling me I was going to be a head coach in the NBA, and when I got the job those same thousand people were shocked,"" Nurse said. ROUGH STARTS Cleveland is 15-34 all time in its first game of the season, including 6-19 on the road. TIP-INS Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. (right ankle) and G JR Smith (right elbow) were inactive. ... Love shot 5-for-18 from the field and went 10-for-14 at the free throw line. ...

"Jimmy Butler says he's going to figure out how to win while on the Timberwolves, and nothing else matters on the court besides competing. (1:09) SAN ANTONIO --  DeMar DeRozan responded to a trade he didn't want with his usual boundless energy and fearless style in the fourth quarter for San Antonio. Jimmy Butler hasn't received a trade he's requested, and turned in a similar performance for Minnesota. DeRozan had 28 points in his San Antonio debut, LaMarcus Aldridge added 21 points and 19 rebounds and the Spurs overcame a 23-point performance by Butler in a 112-108 victory over the Timberwolves on Wednesday night in a matchup of teams coming off a tumultuous offseason. ""It was an extremely long summer for me, extremely long summer,"" DeRozan said. ""So, just to be in this moment, it feels good."" DeRozan was acquired from Toronto after the Spurs responded to Kawhi Leonard's trade demands by dealing their star forward and Danny Green for the Raptors' All-Star guard and Jakob Poeltl. The trade shocked DeRozan, but he has since warmed to the Spurs and San Antonio. Minnesota is facing a similar trade demand from Butler, who has opted to play through it. Butler, who has told Minnesota that he will not re-sign with the team in the offseason, added seven rebounds and three assists in an active 31 minutes. ""I've got 81 games, baby, that's all the matters,"" Butler said when asked if he expects to remain with Minnesota. ""We've got to lock in on today, what tomorrow brings and see where we are at. If that (trade) comes to be, that comes to be, there's nothing I can do about that. But in the meantime, I've got to figure out a way to help us win some games."" DeRozan was initially upset he was traded, but has since embraced San Antonio and those good vibrations propelled him in the fourth. DeRozan banked in the eventual game-winning shot in the final minute against Butler, driving hard to the basket against the 6-foot-8 forward and then pulling up from 12 feet to give San Antonio a 110-108 lead with 32.4 seconds remaining. DeRozan sealed the victory with a pair of free throws with 7.8 seconds remaining after Minnesota's Derrick Rose missed a runner in lane. ""Hey, I've been doing it for some years now,"" the 29-year-old DeRozan said about the late heroics. ""I just feel out the game, always try to be aggressive and at the end moments, I always want to be there. I'm not afraid to make mistakes, but with that I'm not afraid to try to go out there and win the game."" DeRozan's debut was also the close of the Big Three era in San Antonio. Tony Parker left the Spurs to sign with Charlotte in the offseason and Manu Ginobili joined Tim Duncan in retirement. DeRozan and Aldridge are now the cornerstones of the team, and each lauded the other in their debut. ""I haven't played with a guy as dynamic as him since probably Chris Bosh in my rookie year,"" DeRozan said. Aldridge shot 7 for 23 from the field, and had three blocked shots and 11 defensive rebounds. ""He's a great passer,"" Aldridge said of DeRozan. ""He's always looking and probing and I'm too open. I have to get used to being ready and just taking my time. When I figure it out (and) I get my rhythm back, it's going to be way easier out there to score having him."" Rudy Gay had 18 points and Bryn Forbes had 11 points in his first start at point guard for the Spurs. Jeff Teague scored 27 points and Andrew Wiggins added 20 points for the Timberwolves. Karl-Anthony Towns picked up his third foul with 2 minutes left in the first half and fouled out with 4:18 remaining in the game and the Spurs up 99-92. Towns finished with eight points and nine rebounds in 22 minutes. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Teague was down on the court for about 10 seconds in the fourth quarter after tweaking his right ankle on an offensive foul, but gave officials a thumbs-up and remained in the game. ... Minnesota is 3-10 all-time when opening the season on the road. ... The Timberwolves are 9-50 against the Spurs in San Antonio. Their last win in San Antonio was April 17, 2013. Spurs: San Antonio had eight new players on its roster for the season opener for the first time since 1992. The Spurs finished 42-33 that season after firing Jerry Tarkanian 20 games into the campaign. ... DeRozan has played 23,000 minutes in his career, joining Aldridge, LeBron James, James Harden and Russell Westbrook as the only players to do so since 2009. ... Poeltl made just his fifth career start and first since Feb. 14 2017 with Toronto. PAYING HOMAGE TO ALLEN The Spurs observed a moment of silence prior to the game for Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen. Allen passed away Oct. 15 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Aldridge, who played his first nine seasons in Portland before signing with the Spurs in 2015, said it will be difficult to return to the city after Allen's passing. ""He was a great guy and he blessed me and my family and invited us into his world at times,"" Aldridge said. ""I went to the game against Green Bay in his suite. It's definitely bittersweet going back this time."" JERSEY NEEDED DeRozan has been taken aback by the love the Spurs fans have shown him. ""It's crazy, I tried to get my mom a jersey last week and it was sold out,"" DeRozan said. ""I was trying to tell her that and she didn't believe me."" ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE Popovich was asked if this could be his final year coaching in the NBA and he responded with his usual dry wit. ""Anything can happen. I might coach 10 more years or quit in a month,"" he said.","401070699"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Donovan Mitchell wasn't happy with Utah's sporadic defense and neither was coach Quin Snyder. Good thing the Jazz had plenty of scoring options to make up for it. Mitchell scored 11 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and Utah overcame an uneven performance on both ends of the floor to beat the Sacramento Kings 123-117 in the season opener for both teams Wednesday night. ""That whole group that started the game just was flat, and flat defensively,"" Snyder said. ""Against a team that has the level of speed that these guys have, you're playing on your heels and it's hard. As a collective group we just need to be more consistent with our focus defensively throughout the game."" Utah trailed by 16 early in the first quarter, blew a 14-point lead in the third and then pulled away in the fourth. Mitchell, runner-up in Rookie of the Year voting last season, struggled with his shot all night but came up big late. He made a pair of 3-pointers, scored on a driving layup and hit a key free throw with 1:46 remaining. Mitchell shot 8 of 21 and went made only 3 of 10 on 3s. ""You could tell from the tip that they were ready and we didn't do a good job of defending that,"" Mitchell said. ""There was one play where I dunked the ball and I'm jogging back on defense like I did something, and then Justin Jackson gets a 3. Then there was a dead ball and we're all just talking with the ref and they come back down and knock down a 3. Little things like that can't happen."" Rudy Gobert had 19 points and 15 rebounds, Joe Ingles scored 22 and Derrick Favors added 18 points and nine boards as the Jazz won their sixth straight against the Kings. Seven players scored in double figures for Utah. Willie Cauley-Stein had 23 points and seven rebounds for Sacramento. De'Aaron Fox added 21 points and seven assists. ""We played downhill, we played attacking,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We made mistakes. That's what young teams are going to do. But really proud of our team tonight."" Utah beat the Kings by 39 points in a preseason game less than a week earlier but got off to a sloppy start and fell behind 25-9 late in the first quarter. Things turned around quickly for Snyder's team. The Jazz put up 59 points over the next 16 minutes, getting 17 from Ingles, who repeatedly scored from the perimeter after getting freed up on screens. Ingles had 10 points in the second and Mitchell made a layup and 3-pointer to cap a 12-2 run that put the Jazz up 68-55 at halftime. ""We came out a step slow and they wanted it more than us at the beginning of the game,"" Gobert said. ""We had to react."" Utah led 71-57 early in the third before Sacramento went on an 18-2 run. WILLIE'S MOMENT Cauley-Stein's double-double in the season opener was highlighted by a big dunk over Gobert, the 2017 defensive player of the year, in the third quarter that tied the game at 80-all. ""We put the ball to Willie and let him go at him,"" Joerger said. ""He was aggressive and went to his chest most of the night."" ROOKIE DEBUT Marvin Bagley III, the second overall pick in this year's NBA draft, had six points and five rebounds in 12 minutes off the bench for the Kings. His first bucket came on a nifty 11-foot hook shot. ""Preseason kind of helped me so when I got out there it was about playing hard,"" Bagley said. ""Whenever my number is called I have to go hard and do whatever I can."" TIP-INS Jazz: Jae Crowder picked up a technical foul in the third quarter when he shoved the ball into Nemanja Bjelica's chest after getting fouled. ... Utah missed seven of its first nine shots and had five turnovers in the first 5 1/2 minutes. ... Mitchell was 3-of-12 in the first half.

"LOS ANGELES -- A huge reason why the Denver Nuggets missed the playoffs by one game last season was their road record. The Nuggets opened the new season on Wednesday by taking care of business away from home as they rallied in the fourth quarter and defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 107-98. ""That's what mature basketball teams do. When everything's not going well they find ways to win,"" said Paul Millsap, who had 11 points and 16 rebounds. ""We stayed with it, didn't panic and were able to execute down the stretch."" Denver was 46-36 last season but won only 15 games on the road, which is why its postseason drought was extended to five years. It looked like the Nuggets' road woes would catch up with them again. Despite leading most of the game, they trailed 92-84 with 5:14 remaining after the Clippers went on an 11-3 run that was highlighted by a pair of Boban Marjanovic three-point plays. Denver then closed the game by outscoring Los Angeles 23-6. Gary Harris scored six of his 20 points down the stretch while Millsap, who missed his first six shots from the field, hit a jumper with 2:55 remaining to give the Nuggets a 95-94 lead and then was 6 of 8 on foul shots. After a Tobias Harris free throw tied the game at 95, Nikola Jokic gave Denver the lead for good with 1:24 remaining with a putback layup off Jamal Murray's missed jumper. ""We closed out the game well, made some shots and defended well,"" said Jokic, who led the Nuggets with 21 points along with eight rebounds. The Nuggets were 33 of 87 from the field but outrebounded the Clippers by nine (56-47). Los Angeles wasn't much better from the field, going 35 of 87, but it was 8 of 28 on 3-pointers. ""What stood out to me was what I said before the year, which was, `Can we close games?' and tonight we didn't do that,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We had a lead, we had to go offense for defense a little bit. Down the stretch, we really just didn't get good shots."" Tobias Harris had 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Marjanovic added 18 points for the Clippers. Will Barton added 19 points for Denver, with all but six coming in the first half. Denver led 59-54 at the half after scoring the final six points of the second quarter. The Nuggets then extended the lead to 63-54 early in the third quarter before the Clippers slowly whittled it down to two (74-72) at the end of the quarter. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was without Isaiah Thomas (right hip surgery), Jarred Vanderbilt (right foot surgery) and Michael Porter Jr. (lower back surgery). ... Trey Lyles added 10 points. Clippers: Danilo Gallinari had 16 points while Lou Williams added 14. ... Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who was the 11th overall pick in this year's draft, scored 11 points in his NBA debut. HAPPY EXTENSION The win capped off a good day for Denver coach Michael Malone, who received a contract extension after Wednesday's shootaround. The team did not announce the terms of the deal. THUNDEROUS DUNK Marjanovic's dunk and hanging on the rim with 6:55 remaining in the fourth quarter caused a slight delay as the basket needed to be realigned.","401070701"
"WASHINGTON --  Kelly Olynyk certainly wasn't counting on Dwyane Wade to miss. When Wade did, Olynyk was in the perfect spot. Olynyk grabbed the rebound off Wade's errant turnaround jumper and layed in the go-ahead basket with 0.2 seconds left Thursday night, lifting the Miami Heat to a ragged 113-112 victory over the Washington Wizards, who probably could have used sidelined center Dwight Howard's rebounding skills in their season opener. Olynyk was booed every time he touched the ball, on account of a past playoff fracas with the Wizards when he was with the Boston Celtics. He certainly got to enjoy the way this game ended, after Miami trailed by as many as nine points. ""As a rebounder, you got to assume a miss, but I thought he was going to make it, for sure,"" Olynyk said. ""I was surprised I was that open. I kind of just popped loose, and you're kind of just standing right there. Right place, right time."" It was a fitting conclusion to a game in which Miami outrebounded Washington 55-40 overall and a ""Did I read that correctly?!"" 22-7 on the offensive glass, leading to a 27-10 edge in second-chance points. ""That's really where they killed us,"" said John Wall, who led the Wizards with 26 points and nine assists and combined with Bradley Beal to score the hosts' last eight points. ""Anytime you lose by a shot like that at the end ... that's very devastating,"" Wall said. With new starting center Howard still sidelined by a sore backside that kept him out of all of training camp and the preseason, and backup Ian Mahinmi on the bench, Washington's small-ball lineup was unable to prevent Olynyck, a 7-footer, from getting the rebound that settled things. The 6-foot-10 Markieff Morris, normally a power forward, was at center. Morris pointed at himself and 6-9 reserve Jeff Green as the culprits for letting Olynyk into the pain unencumbered. ""That might have been the easiest layup of the game,"" Morris said. Green's take? ""We've got to find a way to grab that rebound,"" he said. ""They outhustled us. That's pretty much it."" And that's even though the Wizards were playing their first game at home, while the Heat were playing on the second night of a back-to-back road trip after losing at Orlando on Wednesday. ""NBA didn't do us no favors at all,"" said Wade, who shot a combined 7 for 24 in Games 1 and 2, ""but we figured out a way to get a win."" TIP-INS Heat: Josh Richardson led Miami with 28 points, Rodney McGruder added 20, and that pair hit consecutive 3s late in the fourth quarter. ... Coach Eric Spoelstra was asked beforehand about Wade, 36, appearing in both ends of the season-opening back-to-back. ""Right now, it's Game 2. He wants to play. We want him to play,"" Spoelstra said. ""And he's in great shape, he feels good, so he's able to go."" ... Derrick Jones Jr. scored 17 points, while Hassan Whiteside had nine points and 10 rebounds. Wizards: Ian Mahnimi started for Howard, but picked up his fourth foul 15 seconds into the third quarter. By quarter's end, four Wizards -- three starters -- each had four personal fouls. Mahinmi ended up playing about 11 1/2 minutes, with three points and one rebound. ... F Kelly Oubre Jr. was the first substitute used by Washington, entering for Otto Porter Jr. midway through the first quarter. WHERE ARE THE 3S? Wizards coach Scott Brooks put an emphasis on pleading with his players to shoot more 3s this season. Didn't work. At least not in Game 1. Washington was only 7 for 26 from beyond the arc. Porter, who was specifically given a green light by Brooks did not attempt a single 3. ""Other than offensive rebounds and missing 3s, I think we should have won the game,"" Wall said. Oh, other than that, Mr. Wall, how was the play? TOLIVER'S DEBUT WNBA All-Star Kristi Toliver made her regular-season debut as an assistant coach on Scott Brooks' staff. ""I love her. Our staff loves her. Our players feel the same way,"" Brooks said. ""She adds value to our program. She's very talented. She loves the game. She's passionate. And she wants to learn.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Charlotte Hornets have owned the Orlando Magic the last three seasons and nobody is more responsible than Kemba Walker. Walker missed his first five shots, didn't score until midway through the second period and finished with 26 points as Charlotte beat Orlando 120-88 on Friday night. It was the Hornets' 12th straight win over the Magic. ""I'm not on the court thinking we want to keep running the streak up against Orlando, that's just not the case,"" Walker said. ""The whole object is to win. I just want to play well and do what I need to do to win the game."" Nicolas Batum and Miles Bridges had 15 points apiece and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 12 for the Hornets, who won for first time this season. Charlotte limited the Magic to just 33.3 percent shooting and 54 points in the first three periods. Terrence Ross came off the bench to lead the Magic with 14 points. Nikola Vucevic and Evan Fournier had 12 points apiece for Orlando, which trailed by 20 at halftime and never got closer than 15 points in the second half. ""To be consistent, you've got to have a way to play and play that way every night and that wasn't at all the case,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""At halftime, I thought we had a great chance to win the game. Twenty is not a big number in this league, but then Kemba got going in the third and that was it."" Walker helped Charlotte overcome a dreadful first half of offense by hitting a pair of 3-pointers and assisting Marvin Williams on two more 3-pointers at the start of the third period as the Hornets pushed their lead to as many as 31 points in the third quarter. The subs for both sides took over at that point, but nothing changed. The first half was forgettable for both teams. Each struggled to make shots and that poor shooting was magnified by 18 turnovers between them. Orlando was slightly worse in both areas with 28.6% shooting and 12 turnovers that allowed Charlotte to build a 51-31 lead by halftime. Walker, who was scoreless in the first quarter, had 14 points in the second, and led an 18-5 run by the Hornets in the final six minutes of the half. TIP-INS HORNETS: Charlotte has won 14 of its last 15 games against the Magic. ... The Hornets shot just 30.4 percent and committed four turnovers in the first period and still led 22-10. MAGIC: C Nikola Vucevic, who didn't have a block in the season opener, had four against Charlotte. ... SG Evan Fournier was shot 0 for 7 in the first half. ... Orlando missed its first 10 3-point attempts and was 6 for 31 (19.4 percent) for the game. SLOW DOWN FOLKS One game into the season, Magic coach Steve Clifford already is hearing questions about when first-round pick Mohamed Bamba is going to replace seven-year veteran Nikola Vucevic in the starting lineup. ""I don't know why we would even have a conversation like that,"" Clifford said. ""Mo is going to be out there playing quality minutes, but he's not ready physically to play starters' minutes. ""Plus, Nik is like a top 10 or 12 starting center in this league. He might be our best offensive player. We get shots strictly by the space he creates on the floor."" LOOKING BACK Hornets coach James Borrego's first NBA coaching gig was in Orlando, where he replaced Jacque Vaughn in the middle of 2014-15 season. Borrego went 6-6 in his first 12 games as the interim coach, but just 4-14 the rest of the way for a 10-20 record. ""I think it laid the foundation for me to be standing here today,"" Borrego said. ""Being thrown into the fire, not knowing what to expect, you've just got to go for it. It gave me the confidence that yeah, you're ready for this.""","401070703"
"NEW YORK --  Caris LeVert had the ball in his hands in the final seconds and the chance to give his team the lead. Two nights earlier, he fumbled it away. He made the most of his second chance Friday. LeVert's driving layup with a second left gave the Brooklyn Nets their first victory of the season, 107-105 over the New York Knicks. LeVert  had a career-high 28 points, surpassing the 27 points he scored Wednesday night in Detroit in a close loss. He made sure they pulled this one out, driving right into the lane and putting up the tiebreaking shot over Tim Hardaway Jr. After the game he said, `Coach, I owed you one,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Nets trailed by one in Detroit when LeVert lost the ball out of bounds with 8.5 seconds left, and they lost by three. But Brooklyn called his number again and he finished up his 15-point final quarter. ""Kenny had a lot of confidence to go back to me tonight and I just wanted to come through,"" LeVert said. D'Angelo Russell and Jarrett Allen each added 15 points for the Nets. They improved to 6-1 in home openers since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. Hardaway and Enes Kanter each scored 29 points for the Knicks, who were trying for just their third 2-0 start in 20 years. Kanter tied it on a three-point play with 15.9 seconds remaining but all they could manage for a final shot after LeVert's basket was a long 3-pointer by Hardaway that wasn't close. Hardaway was disappointed he didn't do more to stop LeVert, his college teammate at Michigan. ""I felt like I could have defended it a lot better. He's been going right the whole entire game so I've just got to know that,"" Hardaway said. The Nets were still without starting forwards Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who just became a father, and DeMarre Carroll, who had right ankle surgery. But they got back Allen Crabbe, their normal starting guard who came off the bench after missing the opener while recovering sprained left ankle. They shot 70 percent in the first quarter and were in control until early in the second half. Then, Kanter and Frank Ntilikina had a couple of baskets apiece in an 11-0 run that wiped out a 10-point deficit and gave the Knicks a 66-65 lead on Hardaway's 3-pointer. New York was ahead 76-74 after three quarters and neither team led by more than six in a back-and-forth final 12 minutes. TIP-INS Knicks: New York's previous 2-0 starts were in 2012-13 and 1999-00. ... G Courtney Lee, sidelined by a neck injury since the preseason, experienced spasms when he picked up his workout level, delaying his season debut. ... G Emmanual Mudiay didn't like the way his sprained right ankle responded when he tried putting more pressure on it and remained out, with coach David Fizdale saying he would be day to day. Nets: Joe Harris' first 3-pointer was his 237th a Net, moving him into 10th place on the franchise's career list. Next up for Harris, in his third season with Brooklyn, is recently retired Richard Jefferson (286), who is now a Nets' analyst for YES Network. ... F Traveon Graham strained his left hamstring in the first half and missed the rest of the game. BOUNCING BACK Knicks rookie Kevin Knox finished with 17 points on 7-for-14 shooting off the bench and was in the game down the stretch. The No. 9 pick in the draft struggled late in preseason to lose what was expected to be a starting spot and shot 4 for 16 on Wednesday in the opener. He said nothing in particular led to his better night. ""I got some wide-open looks the last few games. Today I got some good looks and just the difference is I was making them tonight,"" Knox said. SIZZLING START The Nets made 11 of their first 14 shots from the field. QBS IN THE CROWD Jets quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Josh McCown were at the game.","401070704"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies' newcomers made a fine first impression on the home crowd. Garrett Temple, picked up in a trade from Sacramento, scored 30 points, rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. added 24 as the Grizzlies built a first-half lead and coasted to a 131-117 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. ""The energy was more like a spectacle,"" Jackson said of pregame fireworks, dancers and the performance by Memphis rapper Young Dolph in the home opener. He later added: ""It's a blur. I ain't gonna lie. I really can't (remember specifics)."" Temple, obtained in a July trade, missed only one of his 11 shots, making 5 of 6 from 3-point range. While Jackson, the fourth overall pick in last summer's draft, was starry-eyed and giddy with youthful exuberance, Temple, in his ninth NBA season, was more of a steady vet. Particularly after coach J.B. Bickerstaff texted him Thursday night asking for more leadership to help the Grizzlies forget their season-opening 111-83 loss at Indiana on Wednesday. ""That's part of the reason they brought me here, for my leadership and competitive toughness,"" Temple said. "". I just wanted to have a pace offensively and do some things defensively."" Of his offense, he said: ""The rim opened up for me."" Mike Conley finished with 16 points and 11 assists for Memphis. Taurean Prince led the Hawks with 28 points, while Trae Young, the No. 5 overall pick in the draft, added 20 on 7-for-18 shooting. Miles Plumlee and DeAndre' Bembry each added 12 points. ""For sure not happy with the result, but I feel like I'm getting more comfortable out there,"" Young said of his second NBA regular-season game. ""I'm getting more comfortable with my teammates."" The Hawks, considered one of the league's weakest teams, fell way off the pace in the second quarter when the Grizzlies outscored Atlanta 40-28. From there, the Hawks never really threatened and Memphis extended its lead to 25 points in the third quarter. ""When we get down so much, and we have to battle back, we're putting ourselves in bad spots early on,"" Young said. ""It's hard for us to battle back and take the lead and things like that."" Memphis, which shot 29.8 percent in Wednesday's loss at Indiana, reversed that trend against the Hawks. The Grizzlies finished the game connecting on 54 percent of their shots, including 13-for-26 shooting from beyond the arc. The tone was set early as the Memphis offense clicked to a 77-61 lead at the break, the 77 points matching a franchise record for points in any half. ""We didn't start with the intensity that we wanted to start with defensively and the guys know, and they feel it and understand that,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We just have to apply it to the court. But we did get better (Friday night); we've just got to put it together for 48 minutes."" TIP-INS Hawks: F Omari Spellman sat out with a sore left ankle after rolling it in Wednesday night's loss to the Knicks. ... Young's corner 3-pointer came just before the buzzer ending the first quarter, giving him 13 points in the frame. He was outdone by 15 from Prince. ... Prince's 28 points marked the sixth straight game -- spanning two seasons -- that he has scored at least 20 points. Grizzlies: C Marc Gasol was a game-time decision with a sore back.

YOUNG AND OLD The game featured the league's second-youngest player in Jackson Jr., 19 years old, and the oldest in 41-year-old veteran Vince Carter, who started the game for the Hawks.

"Coach Tom Thibodeau says there's an appreciation for hard work, so he's not surprised fans switched from boos to cheers for Jimmy Butler. (0:57) MINNEAPOLIS --  Jimmy Butler's trade request last month instantly turned him from fan favorite to scorned superstar in Minnesota. With some hustle steals and highlight-reel baskets, he quickly had the crowd at the home opener on his side. Butler brushed off some early jeers, scoring 33 points in 36 minutes to lead the Timberwolves past the Cleveland Cavaliers 131-123 on Friday night. ""I knew as soon as I made an effort play, it was going to turn into cheers,"" Butler said. ""I like it, though. Like I told you, `It's OK to boo me. I'm still going to play hard. I'm still going to try to my best to help win games. Boos, cheers, silence, I've got a job to do."" Andrew Wiggins pitched in with 22 points and Anthony Tolliver hit three 3-pointers off the bench to bolster a vintage all-around effort by the four-time All-Star Butler, who has told the team he won't re-sign when his contract expires next summer. Hence the boos, which began when he was introduced during the pregame pageantry. ""That's the NBA. He loves it,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""The important thing is to get the win. With fans, there's going to be an appreciation for a guy who puts forth that type of effort."" Butler made 10 of 12 field goals and 12 of 12 free throws, with seven rebounds, four steals and three assists to help the Timberwolves (1-1) hold off a late charge by Kevin Love and the LeBron James-less Cavaliers. ""As long as he plays well, the tide will change,"" said Taj Gibson, who had 13 points and eight rebounds. Love had 25 points, 19 rebounds and seven assists against his former team, but the Cavaliers (0-2) have a lot of work to do to become a contender again after James bolted for the Los Angeles Lakers. They allowed the Wolves a franchise record for points in a home opener. ""It's going to be a growth year for us. There's going to be a lot of lessons for us,"" Love said. ""If we can just put consistent basketball together, there's going to be a number of teams that we're going to be able to beat and we're going to give the best teams a good run for their money."" With a layup by Collin Sexton at the 4:02 mark, the Cavs were within 121-117, their closest since trailing 36-34 early in the second quarter. Cedi Osman's 3-pointer kept the Cavs within 125-120, but he missed his next one after Jeff Teague failed to convert a layup on the other end. BUTLER DID IT When the news of Butler's trade request broke exactly one month ago, the likelihood of him awkwardly suiting up in the home opener for the team he's seeking to leave was, well, extremely low. Yet here he was, taking the court at Target Center in the home blues with the white trim. The boos came during the first five possessions by the Wolves each time Butler touched the ball, until he stole a pass by Love in the backcourt and fed Gibson for a dunk. The crowd immediately roared, as if the fans forgot who they were upset with because the play happened so fast. The four-time All-Star had plenty more highlight-reel dunks and steals from there. Soon enough, some ""MVP! MVP! MVP!"" chants even broke out. The Wolves enjoyed a 52-23 run over a 13-minute stretch until late in the second quarter, taking a 20-point lead on a three-point play by Wiggins launched when Karl-Anthony Towns blocked a layup attempt by Osman on the other end to start a fast break. ""As long as you know that my mind and my heart is in the right place and that I do everything to win and I'd do anything for my guys, I'm cool,"" Butler said. ALL FOR LOVE Osman had 22 points, Jordan Clarkson added 19 points off the bench and Tristan Thompson totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Cavs, who trailed 83-62 early in the third quarter. Love brought them to life with a 3-pointer that sparked a 24-10 spurt. He had 13 points in the run. ""He made some shots, really commanded the ball in the post, made some good passes,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""That's the Kevin we're used to."" TIP-INS: Cavaliers: Larry Nance Jr. has yet to play this season because of a sprained right ankle, though Lue said he's hoping to have the center back soon. ""It's a big loss,"" Lue said. ""With the team we have, we need everybody."" ... J.R. Smith played four minutes after missing the opener with a sore left elbow. Timberwolves: Wiggins, who was taken with the first overall pick in the 2014 draft by the Cavs only to be traded to the Wolves two months later in the deal for Love, has averaged 27.2 points in nine career games against Cleveland. ... Towns has only 20 points on 6-for-16 shooting in two games.","401070706"
"NEW ORLEANS --  When Anthony Davis wasn't soaring to the rim to slam down alley-oop lobs, Nikola Mirotic was burying a barrage of 3s that had the crowd chanting his name. By the end of the night, the New Orleans Pelicans were getting a standing ovation for their highest single-game point total in franchise history. Mirotic scored 36 points, Anthony Davis had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and the pace-pushing Pelicans continued their torrid start to the season with a 149-129 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. ""We've been just playing fast, sharing the ball, playing very unselfish,"" Mirotic said. ""I think we're going to be big trouble for the rest of the teams."" Jrue Holiday had 15 points and 10 assists for the Pelicans, who shot 58.9 percent (56 of 95) and reached 110 points in the third quarter. ""We could have had more if we made free throws,"" Davis noted, alluding to New Orleans' 21-of-33 effort from the foul line. ""But for the most part, offensively, our team can pretty much put the ball in the basket."" Julius Randle and Ian Clark each scored 13, and Randle also had 13 rebounds for New Orleans, which opened the season with a surprising 131-112 victory at Houston on Wednesday and has scored at least 30 points in each of its first eight quarters, so far. Davis said 30-point periods ""hopefully"" will remain a regular occurrence. ""Our thing is making sure the other team doesn't have 30, but if we can get 30-plus every quarter, more than likely we're going to win those games,"" Davis said. Willie Cauley-Stein scored 20 points and Marvin Bagley III had 19 for Sacramento, which has lost its first two games. De'Aaron Fox and Frank Mason each scored 18 for the Kings, who shot 52.1 percent, but couldn't keep up with the Pelicans, who combined for 35 assists on their 56 baskets and had eight players with 10 or more points. ""I saw some really good things offensively tonight,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""I see, certainly, a lot of things defensively that can be learned through experience that just takes time as younger guys learn how to play against older guys. I am not fired up about giving up 149, but I do like what I see from a lot of our guys.""

The Pelicans are 2-0 for the first time since 2011-12. MIROTIC'S MOMENT Mirotic hit three 3s in quick succession in the middle of the fourth quarter, the third a step-back shot from the right wing, drawing chants of ""Ni-ko! Ni-ko!"" from the crowd. The Montenegro native said he hadn't had a moment like that since he was a 19-year-old in Madrid, scoring in bunches during a EuroLeague game. ""It was really good to remember those days and to happen in the NBA it's kind of even better,"" Mirotic said. ""So I'm just happy. I'm going to go home. I'm going to be with my wife, son and obviously I'm going to watch that game again."" HIGHLIGHT REEL The Pelicans penchant for setting each other up produced some memorable highlights. In the first half, Holiday was dribbling across the lane when he lofted a right-handed lob that looked like a running hook. Davis soared to palm the ball with his right hand and slam it down in one motion. Later, Davis grabbed an offensive rebound as he crashed to the court, and from his back flipped a pass to Holiday, who drove down the lane for a layup.","401070707"

Again, he can be a lot better. I'm sure tonight he's going to go home and think about all they ways he can be better, and for us, that's exciting.""

""Anytime you're not stopping the ball and that ball is getting to the paint, it forces your defense to collapse,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said.

We need to load to him and stop him. Overall, we have just got to do a better job of doing that earlier in the game. You know once he finds his rhythm, he starts finding guys, and guys were hitting shots. It's hard to defend, but we have to control what we can control out there.""

"LOS ANGELES --  These new-look Clippers like each other. With stars Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan cleared out, Los Angeles is looking to compete with a mix of veterans and youngsters who came together to earn their first win of the season. Danilo Gallinari and Tobias Harris scored 26 points each and the Clippers rallied in the fourth quarter for a 108-92 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. ""They just want to win and they're over themselves,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. The Thunder fell to 0-2 without Russell Westbrook, who has a right knee issue. ""He's missed everywhere,"" said guard Raymond Felton, who had 10 points off the bench. Lou Williams, last season's Sixth Man of the Year, added 17 points off the bench.

""When you see the energy and the fans on our side, we were just having fun,"" Gallinari said. Paul George led the Thunder with 20 points before fouling out with 1:13 remaining in the game. He was 7 of 27 from the field in part because of the defense of Avery Bradley and Luc Mbah a Moute. ""They made it a hard night on George,"" Rivers said.

We made them work for those shots in the first half and we felt like if we continued to work like that, that eventually they would break.

RAINING 3s The Nets shot 43.2 percent (16 of 37) from 3-point range and made six 3s in the second quarter to regain the lead briefly when D'Angelo Russell made one to put Brooklyn ahead 56-53 with 4:07 remaining in the first half. The Pacers shot 66.7 percent (16 of 24) from 3 and made five in the fourth quarter to help put the game away.","401070710"
"NEW YORK --  The Celtics could laugh afterward, because none of Jayson Tatum's mistakes cost them. Not the missed dunk with 36 seconds left -- thanks to Tatum rebounding it himself and making a tough jumper -- and not his foolish foul with 1.9 seconds remaining. Tatum did far more good than bad, finishing with 24 points and 14 rebounds as Boston held on to beat the New York Knicks 103-101 on Saturday night. ""I mean, that guy's just super talented,"" Kyrie Irving said. ""To be so young, to be so poised is an awesome trait for him."" The second-year forward showed it with his calm response to his botched dunk with the Celtics clinging to a one-point lead. ""He should've made the dunk,"" Irving said. ""I told him, `I can't dunk it for you, I can only pass you the ball."" Tatum grabbed the rebound and with the clock running down made a tough turnaround jumper for a 101-98 lead with 21 seconds to go. ""I was just trying to make up for it,"" Tatum said. ""I just missed the easy one."" He had then given the Celtics another three-point lead with two free throws with 7.9 seconds left and the Knicks called their final timeout. They had trouble getting the ball inbounded from the sideline, and Knicks guard Trey Burke had to race into the backcourt to retrieve it as the clock ran down. He pulled up for a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc and Tatum jumped to contest it, fouling Burke for three free throws that could have tied it. But he missed the first and the Knicks couldn't grab the rebound when he intentionally missed the third. ""As a point guard, I know I can knock those down in my sleep but tonight I missed the first one. I got to live with that,"" Burke said. ""I feel like I let my teammates down."" Irving and Marcus Morris each added 16 points for the Celtics, who rebounded from their loss in Toronto on Friday night. They won despite giving Gordon Hayward a night off to rest his surgically repaired left ankle. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 24 points for the Knicks, who lost rookie Kevin Knox to a sprained left ankle in the first quarter. Enes Kanter had 17 points and 15 rebounds before fouling out of their second two-point loss in two nights. The Celtics are considered one of the Eastern Conference favorites but coach Brad Stevens said the Raptors were clearly better now and Boston needed to improve after Toronto's 113-101 victory Friday night. On Saturday night, they were just good enough to beat the rebuilding Knicks. The Celtics looked sharp early in racing to a 26-10 lead Saturday and still had a double-digit cushion midway through the second quarter before Damyean Dotson's second straight 3-pointer trimmed it to 50-48 by halftime. TIP-INS Celtics: Aron Baynes got the start with Hayward out and scored 10 points. But he played only 12 minutes before leaving with a sore right hamstring. ... Jaylen Brown was only 2 for 9, finishing with seven points. Knicks: Coach David Fizdale said G Courtney Lee would see specialists Monday after experiencing neck spasms that went down into his chest. Lee was sidelined throughout the preseason by a neck injury. ... Kanter became the first Knick since Zach Randolph (2007-08) to start the season with three straight double-doubles. KNOX KNOCKED OUT Knox was driving for a layup on a fast break when his ankle appeared to roll badly as he was fouled by Terry Rozier III. Knox stayed on the court briefly, appearing in pain, then was carried off by a pair of teammates. Because the No. 9 pick wasn't able to shoot the free throws, he was, by rule, forced to miss the remainder of the game. The Knicks said X-rays on his ankle were negative. HAYWARD'S HEALTH Stevens said there wasn't a plan to rest Hayward on back-to-backs, but his minutes are being watched and he's being evaluated on a game-by-game basis. He said Hayward, who broke his ankle last year in the season opener, was just experiencing general soreness Saturday and didn't think it was anything overly concerning.","401070711"
"PHILADELPHIA --  When Ben Simmons went down with an injury, JJ Redick stepped off the bench and into a starring role for the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Redick scored 31 points, including a 3-pointer with 17 seconds left that lifted the 76ers over the Orlando Magic 116-115. Redick had his best game since transitioning from starter to sixth man for the 76ers at the start of the season, making 10 of 20 shots, including eight 3-pointers. ""JJ Redick was our bell-ringer tonight,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We needed every bit of JJ tonight to find a way of getting out of this building with a win. When Ben goes out, you realize you're going to need help from someplace else. ... We knew JJ was going to have to take up some of that slack."" Aaron Gordon had a chance to tie it with 10 seconds remaining but missed his second free throw, and a last second jumper by Terrance Ross missed the net entirely. Joel Embiid had 32 points and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, including 19 points by halftime. He did it with an outside game in the first half but was more of a force down low after intermission. Yet, Embiid's biggest play was an assist to Redick on the winning shot. It was a play that went awry and resulted in a turnover in the 76ers season-opener against Boston. But the pairing made good against Orlando. ""I was (mad) in Boston because we usually understand each other so well,"" Embiid said. ""But I love playing with him. When it comes to sharing the ball, whether I'm going to set a screen for him or just hand the ball off I know I'm going to be happy with the outcome. The only thing is I wish he was 24 years old so we could play 10 years together, but he's old."" Dario Saric scored 13 points and Robert Covington had 12 as the 76ers improved to 2-1 this season. Evan Fournier had 31 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic added 27 points and Gordon had 20. ""We played better but we should have won the game,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We had two huge defensive mistakes late on plays that we defended the whole game. You can't make those mistakes against a good team on the road. That game was there to be won. There were plays to be made and you got to make them."" Simmons left the game after the first quarter with a tight back, meaning Philadelphia had to lean that much more on Embiid and Redick. With Simmons out, Markelle Fultz was given an opportunity to play extended minutes and run the offense. Fultz finished with eight points on 4-of-11 shooting and added seven assists with only one turnover. However, with the game on the line, 76ers coach Brett Brown opted to use T.J. McConnell at the point and kept Fultz on the bench. High scores have been common in the early part of the NBA season as teams are pushing the pace and trying more shots, especially from deep. Both teams shot lights out from 3-point territory. The Sixers, paced by Redick, shot 17 of 34 (50 percent) while the Magic, led by Fournier's six 3-pointers, shot 16 of 29 (55.2 percent). Thirteen players attempted shots from beyond the arc, eight for Orlando and five for Philadelphia. EMBIID'S OUTSIDE GAME Embiid stretched the Magic defense in the first half, attempting four 3-pointers. He made three of them. Embiid said it was something he worked on a lot over the summer but that he needed to make the shots tonight or he might give up on the concept. SIMMONS INJURY UPDATE Brown said Simmons' back started stiffening up on him before the game, but he decided to give it a go. The decision to pull Simmons was made by trainers. Brown said he didn't thing the injury was serious and the decision was likely more precautionary than anything else. Brown said the team would update Simmons' status Sunday. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando let a 16-point lead slip away in the first half in short order. They led 26-10 with 5:13 to go in the quarter but fell behind for the first time at 11:25 of the second quarter and didn't regain the lead until Ross hit his desperation 3-pointer with 1:24 to play in the game. They were outscored by Philadelphia 23-6 in that 5:48 run. ... The Magic have now lost four straight against Philadelphia. They had won 13 of the previous 17. 76ers: Embiid broke 30 minutes played for the third straight game to start the season. He only did that twice in the first 10 games last season, and not until Nov. 1. McConnell played 25 minutes for the Sixers, more than any bench player besides Redick. He finished with eight points, four rebounds and four assists. Brown admitted that he went with McConnell over Fultz in the fourth quarter because of his experience.","401070712"
"MIAMI --  Kemba Walker got a call, and the Charlotte Hornets got a win. Walker continued his red-hot start by scoring 39 points, including the game-winning free throw with a half-second left, and the Hornets wasted a 26-point second-half lead but still spoiled Dwyane Wade's final home opener by topping the Miami Heat 113-112 on Saturday night. Wade scored with 12.3 seconds left to tie the game, and the Hornets gave the ball to Walker. He drove on Miami's Rodney McGruder, wound up on the ground and got the call from referee Scott Wall -- one the Heat argued to no avail. ""I just saw a little bit of a lane,"" Walker said. ""I thought I did a good job at getting the contact."" Walker made the first free throw, intentionally missed the second and time expired before anyone could contain the rebound. ""This is a game, for sure, you want it to keep going,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who thought McGruder defended Walker perfectly on the deciding play. ""It should have been decided in an overtime, if not more."" Malik Monk scored 15 for Charlotte, and Marvin Williams added 13. Wade led the Heat with 21 points. Goran Dragic scored 20, McGruder finished with 19 and Hassan Whiteside grabbed 15 rebounds for Miami. ""You just want the players to decide the games,"" Wade said. ""Our refs have the toughest job, I feel, of any refs in any sport. But two teams fight like that, you just want the players to decide it. It's tough. Obviously, we all were very angry about it."" Charlotte was 12 for 20 from 3-point range in the first half, fueling its run to the huge lead. The Hornets then went 1 for 12 from beyond the arc in the third quarter, and missed their first three tries from deep in the fourth quarter before Monk rattled one down for a 103-97 lead with about 5 minutes left. But it wasn't over, not by a long shot. Wade made a pair of 3-pointers, then set up Whiteside for a basket that got the Heat within 107-105. Miami kept chipping away, getting within 111-110 on a drive by McGruder with 46 seconds left. After Michael Kidd-Gilchrist made one of two foul shots after getting fouled by Whiteside -- another call the Heat did not like -- Miami had the ball down two with 24.7 seconds left. Wade tried a 3 for the lead and missed badly -- so badly that he knew where the rebound was going. He scooted in, got the board himself and laid it in for a tie with 12.3 seconds left to mark the first and only time that the Hornets didn't lead after halftime. That's when the Hornets gave the ball to Walker for their final play, and he delivered. ""I was really proud of our group,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte had lost six straight against Miami. ... Walker got his 10,000th career point on a drive in the third quarter. ""You're talking about being in an elite class,"" Borrego said of the milestone. ""You've got to work. You've got to get better every single year. You can't relax."" Heat: Miami's three games have been decided by margins of three points, one point and one point, each of them going down to the final second. ... Miami is 9-2 in home openers under Spoelstra. Both losses have come to Charlotte. ... The Heat outrebounded Charlotte 49-40, but saw their 16 turnovers converted into 25 points. SIZZLING WALKER Walker has 19 3-pointers already, the most by any NBA player through his team's first three games of any season. Walker also has 106 points through Charlotte's first three games. That's more than he's ever scored in his first four games of an NBA season -- he had 92 in his first four appearances of the 2016-17 season. ""They're like, `Kemba, keep shooting,"" Walker said of his coaches and teammates. ""That's what I'm going to keep on doing."" ONE LAST DANCE It was the final home opener for Wade, who has dubbed this season ""one last dance."" He and fellow 16-year veteran Udonis Haslem addressed the Miami crowd before the game. ""We want to thank each and every last one of you guys,"" Wade said.","401070713"
"CHICAGO --  Blake Griffin was having a big game and he had just hit a key 3-pointer on his previous attempt. Still, the perennial All-Star had no problem deferring to a reserve for a potential game-winning shot Saturday night. Griffin had 33 points and 12 rebounds, Ish Smith scored all 15 of his points in the second half, including the decisive basket, and the Detroit Pistons beat the Bulls 118-116 in Chicago's home opener. ""Ish is unbelievable,"" Griffin said. ""He just does so many things that are huge for our team. I think the team recognizes that, but I hope everybody else does, too."" Griffin was 12 for 23 from the field, including 5 of 7 on 3-pointers, as Detroit won its second straight to start the season. With the score tied at 116, Smith drove through the defense for a layup with 5.4 seconds left. ""Coach (Dwane Casey) set up a great play and I got two great screens,"" Smith said. Zach LaVine had 33 points on 12-of-22 shooting for Chicago, which dropped its second consecutive game. The Bulls played without starters Kris Dunn (excused absence) and Lauri Markkanen (sprained right elbow), and reserve Denzel Valentine (left ankle). ""I loved his aggressiveness,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said of LaVine. ""I thought he started the game attacking and that's when he's at his best."" Detroit had a 60-58 halftime lead despite shooting 34 percent in the first two quarters. Griffin had 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting. LaVine had 19 first-half points for Chicago. The Pistons led 85-84 entering the fourth before the Bulls scored four straight points. Smith put Detroit back on top 89-88 and the Pistons held a slim advantage until LaVine hit a 3-pointer with 24.6 seconds left. After Smith's basket, Chicago had a chance to tie or go ahead with a 3, but LaVine lost the ball -- he was pressured by Griffin -- as he rose for a 3-pointer. ""It can't happen,"" LaVine said. ""It has to be either a miss or a make, so that's really upsetting to lose that way. We played so good and to have it end like that, it's an emotional roller-coaster. Griffin was asked if he got a hand on the ball. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I'm gonna say yeah for now."" A WIN IS A WIN To make the playoffs this season, the Pistons know they must play well on the road. They consider Saturday a good start. ""A win is a win on the road,"" Casey said. ""That was one of our challenges going into this year -- executing on the road. In the game, we still need to be better, down the stretch we have to do better, and we will."" ROOKIE WOES Bulls C Wendell Carter Jr., the seventh pick in the NBA draft, had eight points and two rebounds in 18 minutes mostly matched up against Detroit's Andre Drummond. It wasn't an overwhelming effort, but Carter has a fan in Griffin. ""I can't speak for him, but I'm sure it's chaos and confusion for him right now,"" Griffin said. ""He doesn't look that way, but that's just how you feel no matter what when you're a rookie. ""But he's so talented that he's going to be fine. It's just a matter of time. I watched him play probably more than any other player in college. I really like his game."" TIP-INS Pistons: F Reggie Bullock (illness) and F Stanley Johnson (toe) returned to the starting lineup after missing the opener against Brooklyn. Bullock finished with 16 points in 24 minutes, while Johnson had 10 points in 30 minutes. Bulls: Valentine will be out for at least another two weeks after a scan on Friday revealed a bone bruise in his left ankle. He'll be re-evaluated in two weeks. ""It's not that bad,"" Valentine said. ""My ankle's feeling better, so it's just time."" ... Dunn missed his second straight game following the birth of his first child. He is expected to rejoin the team Monday in Dallas.","401070714"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic had the home crowd roaring in the teenager's Dallas debut with step-back 3-pointers and big buckets late while fellow youngster Dennis Smith Jr. quietly played a secondary role. The script flipped in the final seconds. Doncic scored 26 points after a rough start in the No. 3 overall pick's first home game, Smith converted a tiebreaking three-point play with six seconds left and the Mavericks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 140-136 in a wild offensive game Saturday night. ""We're going to have ups and downs,"" said center DeAndre Jordan, who had 22 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks in his first game in front of the fans who used to boo him unmercifully after the Texas native backed out on a pledge to join Dallas in free agency three years ago. ""We've got young guys with high character and poise with good basketball IQs. Dennis stuck with it tonight and he ultimately made a play that won us the game."" The Timberwolves didn't seem to miss Jimmy Butler much after letting the disgruntled guard stay home to rest a night after he scored a team-high 33 points in their first win. Minnesota matched the most points Dallas has given up in a first quarter while taking a 46-37 lead. But a 15-point Minnesota lead in the first quarter was gone before halftime in a game with nine lead changes in the second half. And the Mavericks mostly canceled out the Wolves' big first quarter with 43 points in the fourth. A 19-year-old who is the second-youngest ever to play for the Mavericks, Doncic kept Dallas ahead in the closing minutes by twice backing down for baskets over Derrick Rose, who had 28 points in his highest-scoring game since late in the 2016-17 season. After Karl-Anthony Towns hit an off-balance 3 on his way to 31 points to help the Timberwolves get close and Taj Gibson made a jump-hook in the lane to pull them even with 27 seconds left, Smith made Rose the defensive victim again. Smith -- a 20-year-old and the third-youngest to play for the Mavericks after making his debut as a teenager this time last year -- hit a jumper just inside the 3-point line over Rose and drew the foul. The free throw put the Mavericks up 137-134. Smith scored 10 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, including the last six for Dallas. ""We just have to play defense,"" Rose said. ""It seemed like everyone I was covering tonight made a tough shot on me and I just have to do a better job of contesting shots."" Doncic, the No. 3 overall pick and second-youngest to play in a game for the Mavericks, bounced back from a slow start and finished 8 of 16 from the field and 4 of 9 from 3-point range two nights after a fairly rough NBA debut in a loss at Phoenix. With 40-year-old fellow European Dirk Nowitzki watching from the bench in a light blue suit while dealing with an ankle issue, Doncic missed his first three shots and quickly committed two of his game-high six turnovers. But Doncic sparked a flurry of 15 points in the final 6:41 of the second quarter with a floater that drew a foul, although he missed the free throw. He poked away a loose ball and hit a second straight 3-pointer to give the Mavericks their first tie at 54-all. The Mavericks took their first lead at 62-61 in the second quarter on Jordan's layup on an alley-oop pass from J.J. Barea, who finished with 11 assists. TEXAS TWO-STEP The Timberwolves had to make two trips to Texas in a three-day span, part of the reason for sitting Butler so early. They opened with a loss at San Antonio before beating Cleveland on Friday night. ""It was a tough turnaround for us,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You get in late and you have to come with energy. I liked the energy to start the game."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: The Timberwolves shot 63 percent while building their first-quarter lead. ... Jeff Teague had 22 points and a team-high nine assists. ... Andrew Wiggins scored 19 before fouling out in the final seconds. Mavericks: Harrison Barnes (right hamstring strain) and Devin Harris (left hamstring strain) joined Nowitzki on the sidelines. ... The Mavericks set a franchise record with 50 3-point attempts, making 17 (34 percent). ... Wesley Matthews and Dwight Powell scored 19 points apiece. Barea had 12. ...

"DENVER --  On a historic night in which he was serenaded with ""MVP!"" chants for his eye-popping triple-double, Nikola Jokic's thoughts were with the Denver Nuggets' injured tone-setter. Forward Will Barton will go for an MRI on Sunday morning after injuring his right hip on a reverse layup in the third quarter of Denver's 119-91 win over the Phoenix Suns on Saturday night. ""We're going to miss him -- a lot,"" Jokic said. ""Not just on the court, just vocally. He's a guy who can speak with everybody, with the coach, he can say whatever. He doesn't have that `hair on the tongue' is how we call it in Serbia. ""Hopefully he can be back soon."" Paul Millsap called Barton ""the voice of this locker room."" ""He's the one that's talking before games, he's the one that's bringing us together,"" Millsap said. ""It's going to be tough to lose that, if we have to. But hopefully, we're going to pray everything's OK and he's back with us soon."" Barton, who had 14 points in 19 minutes before being wheeled off, said he felt something pop when he took off for the basket and was still sore, but in much less pain, after the game. ""I'll just wait for the MRI,"" Barton said. ""I don't want to predict anything or get to high or too low, just once I find out, take it from there."" Jokic, who had 11 assists and 12 rebounds, joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to post a triple-double with 30 or more points without missing a field goal. Chamberlain did it twice, in 1966 and `67. ""He had one of those nights tonight,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He missed one shot tonight, from the foul line. And anytime you're mentioned in company with Wilt Chamberlain, you're doing something right."" Jokic made all 11 of his shots from the floor and missed just one of 11 free throws on a night the crowd serenaded him with chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" ""Individually and collectively we got spanked in every aspect of the game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Jokic had a monster game."" Jokic also had four steals, zero turnovers and a blocked shot. ""It was a perfect night for him,"" Jamal Murray said. ""He hit every shot today, no turnovers, triple-double. So, it couldn't get any better."" Save for the one missed free throw. CO-STARS Murray added 26 points as Denver's starters outscored Phoenix's 107-58. The Nuggets are off to their first 2-0 start since 2011-12 and will go for their first 3-0 start since 2009-10 when they host the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors on Sunday night. NO MATCH Devin Booker's 25 points led the Suns, who were hoping for another stellar game from top overall draft pick Deandre Ayton, who had 18 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his po debut against Dallas. But Jokic dominated from the start and Ayton never got going, finishing with 5 points on 2-of-7 shooting. ""It was a learning lesson for me,"" Ayton said of his matchup with Jokic. ""In time I'm going to be doing the same thing."" Millsap said Jokic's play was inspiring on both ends of the court. ""It's great. We all eat off him. He feeds us all (when) the offense is clicking,"" Millsap said. ""But most importantly, the job he did on the defensive end was important for us."" TIP-INS: Suns: Phoenix was without G Troy Daniels, who sustained a concussion at practice. ""It was a contact practice, guys were scrimmaging and it happened right in front of me,"" Kokoskov said. ""It didn't look that hard but he didn't pass the test."" Nuggets: Denver was 31-10 at home last season, fourth-best in the NBA. ... Murray tried to get too fancy on a steal and layup and was stripped when he tried to go behind his back before scoring. ... Torey Craig's defensive versatility will be called upon if Barton misses much time.","401070716"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard had 29 points while CJ McCollum added 24 and Portland Trail Blazers downed the San Antonio Spurs 121-108 on Saturday night. Jusuf Nurkic added 12 points for the Blazers, who have opened the season with a pair of home wins. They led the Spurs by as many as 20 points in the fourth quarter after a close first half. DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and nine rebounds in a second strong performance after coming to the Spurs in an offseason trade. DeRozan had 28 points in his San Antonio debut Wednesday in a 112-108 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was traded from Toronto in July along with Jakob Poeltl in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.  DeRozan wasn't happy about the deal, especially in light of his close friendship with Toronto teammate Kyle Lowry, but he appears to have developed a nice chemistry with his new team. His arrival also signaled the end of the Big Three era in San Antonio. Tony Parker left the Spurs to sign with Charlotte in the offseason and Manu Ginobili joined Tim Duncan in retirement. The Blazers opened the season with a 128-119 victory over the Lakers, spoiling LeBron James' debut with the team. Lillard had 28 points and Nik Stauskas came off the bench to score 24 for Portland, which won its 18th straight home opener to extend an NBA record. Portland's season has started on a somber note following the death of owner Paul Allen. The enigmatic co-founder of Microsoft died Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was 65. Lillard's first basket was a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc. The Spurs pulled ahead 29-28 on Bryn Forbes' 3-pointer in the opening half, but Meyers Leonard put Portland back in front with an alley-oop dunk from Evan Turner. Portland extended its lead to 47-38 on Al-Farouq Aminu's 3-pointer. The Blazers led 59-50 at the break, led by Lillard with 14 points. DeRozan had 15 for the Spurs. McCollum's 3-pointer put the Blazers up 73-60, their biggest lead of the game to that point. The team stretched the lead to as many as 18 points in the 38-point quarter. The Blazers shot 53.6 percent from the floor for the game. The Spurs shot 42 percent. TIP INS Spurs: The two teams will meet four total times this season. The Spurs won last season's series 2-1. ... Chimezie Metu made his NBA debut. Metu was selected by the Spurs in the second round of the NBA Draft this past summer, after three seasons at USC. Trail Blazers: Stauskas, acquired by the Blazers as a free agent in the offseason, grabbed the attention of fans with his performance in the opener and was treated with cheers when he came off the bench in the second quarter. ... Lillard finished with nine assists.","401070717"
"CLEVELAND -- Trae Young got doused with a bucket of ice water after his third NBA game. The Cavaliers couldn't do anything to cool off Atlanta's rookie guard. Young scored 35 points with 11 assists -- the best line by a first-year player since Steph Curry in 2010 -- and Kent Bazemore scored 23 on Sunday as the Hawks rolled to an easy 133-111 win over Cleveland, which lost its home opener and fell to 0-3 as it readjusts to life without LeBron James. The No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft, Young shook off a slow start and showed why the Hawks believe he's a future superstar. Afterward, Young was targeted by teammates after they soaked coach Lloyd Pierce following his first win. ""It was super cold,'' Young said with a smile after his shocking bath. ""I thought it would just be Coach Pierce because he had his first win, but it was all right. I'll take it.'' Young was unaware that he matched Curry, who twice scored at least 35 with 10 assists in his first season with Golden State. Just three games into the season, Young has 79 more chances to do it again. ""Now that we know what he's capable of, we'll be expecting a little bit more,'' Bazemore joked. The Hawks made a team-record 22 3-pointers, including 10 while scoring 41 in the fourth quarter, to blow open the game and send Cleveland fans home early, with many shaking their heads on the way out. Jordan Clarkson scored 19, and Kevin Love had 16 with 17 rebounds for the Cavs, who could be in for a very long season post-LeBron. Cleveland's issues appear to be far deeper than no longer having the game's best player. The Cavs aren't playing professional-level defense and have given up 116, 131 and 133 points in their first three games. ""We didn't expect to be 0-3,'' said Love, who was asked if he was alarmed by the performance. ""On opening night at home, we expect to play better in front of our own fans. I don't know if alarming is the right word, but it sure seems right, right now. Our effort level just wasn't there. It's just going to be a growth year for us. We've got to get better.'' While wearing neon green sneakers, Young showed plenty of flash in his game. He made six of seven shots and scored 18 in the second quarter, helping the Hawks erase a 14-point deficit and go up 64-60 at halftime. ""Trae is fearless,'' Bazemore said. ""Even in the practices earlier in the summer, he came in and established himself right away. That's what you have to respect: a young guy that comes in, he's not bashful, he's not shy and who has that kind of caliber talent. He's going to have ups and downs. I'm proud of him as a teammate.'' It's a whole new ballgame in Cleveland without James, who carried the Cavs to four straight NBA Finals and a title in 2016 before leaving as a free agent -- for the second time -- in July for Los Angeles. The Cavs are starting over, but believe they can still be competitive in the Eastern Conference. They're pinning most of that hope on Love, who signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension this summer. But he doesn't have much help, and it could be a while before Sexton is ready to contribute. Sexton came off the bench and scored four points on 2-of-11 shooting in 28 minutes. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue thought his young guard might have gotten caught up in his matchup with Young. ""He took it personal,'' Lue said. ""He was flying over screens to get there, and that's not what we wanted to do.'' TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta had 32 assists on 48 field goals. ... Atlanta has 10 players with two years or less NBA experience. The Hawks' roster currently averages 3.64 years, a number that drops to 2.63 with the exclusion of Vince Carter, a 20-year veteran. Cavaliers: Sexton was called for a Flagrant 1 foul in the second quarter for stepping under Bazemore, who was attempting a 3-pointer. ... Love went 6-of-19 and is 17-of-56 in three games. MARQUEE MATCHUP Young didn't take any satisfaction in beating Sexton. ""You look forward to playing anybody in your class,'' he said. ""Playing against him throughout high school, USA Basketball, things like that. You look forward to playing against guys you grew up with. I was looking to playing against Collin, but at the same time, I look forward to playing against everybody.'' WELCOME BACK Pierce was on familiar turf. He began his coaching career in Cleveland, hired by Mike Brown in 2007. Pierce has former Cavs assistants Melvin Hunt and Chris Jent on his staff. ""It's somewhat surreal when you think about it, starting here 12 years ago,'' Pierce said. ""We spent many days and afternoons here at the Q. A lot of credit to Mike and the opportunity he gave all of us.''","401070718"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook was in no mood to talk after his season debut. Iman Shumpert scored 26 points and the Sacramento Kings beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 131-120 on Sunday night to spoil Westbrook's return. Westbrook missed the preseason and the first two regular-season games after having a procedure to deal with inflammation in his right knee. He had 32 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in 35 minutes after averaging a triple-double the past two seasons. Westbrook sat at his locker for more than 20 minutes before getting in the shower and finally addressed the media about an hour after the game ended. ""I was OK,"" he said. ""It wasn't my best night, but I've got however many more games left to play, so I'm not worried. It was my first time. I just hate losing. Honestly, I don't really care to talk about how I played."" Thunder coach Billy Donovan liked what he saw from Westbrook, who made 13 of 23 field goals and was his usual unstoppable self when attacking the rim. ""I thought Russell really played well,"" Donovan said. ""I give him a lot of credit. He worked really hard the last five to six weeks to try to get himself ready. For him to come back, being out as long as he was and play like he did -- I thought we were faster, I thought we got downhill more, I thought the ball was moving."" De'Aaron Fox scored 22 points and Buddy Hield added 17 for the Kings. They shot 54.9 percent to earn their first win of the season. Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said it was a big win for his team, given the buildup for Oklahoma City. ""They come back from the West Coast, they get their guy back and opening night, and a lot going on,"" Joerger said. ""I've got a lot of respect for them. We got the ball up and down the floor and we played fast."" Paul George scored 29 points and Steven Adams added 10 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder. Sacramento led 68-56 at halftime behind 54.5 percent shooting. Westbrook had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists at the break. The Kings pushed their lead to 17 in the third quarter, but the Thunder rallied. A driving dunk by rookie Hamidou Diallo cut Sacramento's lead to 10 and helped bring the crowd back into the game. Oklahoma City closed the quarter strong, but Sacramento still led 97-90 entering the fourth. The Thunder cut the deficit to five in the fourth quarter, but Sacramento held on. Hield hit a 3-pointer with just over 2 minutes remaining to slow Oklahoma City's momentum. TIP-INS Kings: Shumpert scored 16 points in the first quarter and helped the Kings shoot 60 percent in the period. ... Marvin Bagley III, a rookie from Duke, finished with 13 points and seven rebounds. He scored 19 points in his previous game against New Orleans. Thunder: Westbrook scored 11 points in the first quarter. ... George, Adams and backup center Nerlens Noel each committed three fouls in the first half. George committed his fifth foul late in the third quarter. ... The Thunder made just 19 of 30 free throws. HOME SWEET HOME Hield, who played his college ball at Oklahoma, got a warm ovation during pregame introductions. ""It's cool,"" he said. ""Like I said, it's my second home. I was here for four years. Glad to be here. The fans always embrace me well."" SHOTS APLENTY The Thunder took 104 shots, but made just 44.2 percent of them. Oklahoma City's stars, Westbrook and George, made 23 of 41 shots. The rest of the Thunder made 23 of 63. The Thunder had 18 offensive rebounds, which helped them take 13 more shots than the Kings. STRUGGLING SCHRODER Dennis Schroder, the new Thunder player who replaced Westbrook in the starting lineup the first two games, took his share of the blame for the rough start. He made just 5 of 16 shots against the Kings and has made 14 of 50 shots this season. ""We've got to figure it out,"" Schroder said. ""I think the last couple of games, we didn't do a good job of selecting the shots and I take that on me the first two games. I've got to be better and got to make my shots as well, but as a unit, we've got to be better and take better shots. We've just got to get used to it and figure each other out.""","401070719"
"DENVER --  Juancho Hernangomez's swooping right-handed swat was precisely the right stuff to help the Denver Nuggets stay unbeaten. Turns out, this high-scoring Nuggets team can play a little defense, too. Hernangomez blocked a tying layup from behind just before the buzzer and the Nuggets held off the Golden State Warriors 100-98 on Sunday night. Trailing by 13 points in the fourth quarter, the Warriors rallied and had a chance to tie it in the closing seconds. Stephen Curry drove down the lane and passed to big man Damian Jones, who had his shot rejected by Hernangomez. ""Huge,"" said Gary Harris, who finished with 28 points. The Nuggets improved to 3-0 despite missing 18 free throws, including six in the final quarter. The 3-0 start is Denver's best since the 2009-10 squad led by Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups began 5-0. This victory was driven by defense. Denver was sluggish on the offensive end in the second game of a back-to-back but turned up the defensive intensity. The Nuggets forced 18 turnovers. Denver has held all three teams it's faced under 100 points. ""If we defend, we can pretty much outscore everyone in this league. Defense is really our main focus this year,"" Nuggets forward Torrey Craig said. That's music to coach Michael Malone's ears. ""This is how I envision us playing. Some people may call it ugly, but a win is a win, especially against that team -- the reigning champs,"" Malone said. ""If we continue to defend at the level we're defending at and we get our offensive rhythm going, I think we could be a really good team."" Nikola Jokic had 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assist in his bid for a triple-double on a second straight night. No surprise, Curry hit three straight 3-pointers in a 1:11 span to lead the comeback. He finished with 30 points and had six 3-pointers to move him past Paul Pierce for sixth place on the NBA's career list. Draymond Green had a chance to tie the game at 99-all with 9.6 seconds remaining, but his second free throw rolled out. Jamal Murray made one of two free throws on the other end to make it 100-98 and set the stage for Hernangomez, who was engulfed by teammates soon after his swat. ""That was a great play by, um, Juancho, right? It was a great block by him,"" Kevin Durant said. ""You've got to give him credit. Steph made a huge play, dropped it off. Can't ask for anything better."" Asked if he thought about pulling up for a 3-pointer, Curry responded: ""No. I didn't think about it this time. I was going downhill when I crossed court and I saw the lane wide open and realized what the score was. I liked our chances from there, but it didn't work out that way."" Durant showed off his true colors -- wearing a yellow shoe on his right foot to go with a gold, white and hint of blue one on his left. He finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Murray briefly left in the third quarter with what appeared to be a left leg ailment. The team was already missing versatile forward Will Barton, who was carted off the court Saturday with a right hip injury. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston sat out with a bruised left knee. ""We need to have him ready for the long haul so night's like this if he's banged up we'll rest him,"" coach Steve Kerr explained. ... Durant was given a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing a call. Nuggets: The Nuggets are 21-7 at home against the Warriors since 2003-04. BARTON UPDATE Barton underwent an MRI on Sunday morning and Malone said the team will have a clearer idea how long me may be sidelined Monday. ""Hopefully we'll get some good news,"" Malone said. With Barton sidelined, the Nuggets went with a rotation of Craig, Hernangomez and Trey Lyles. They combined for 19 points. SHOOTING WOES Through three games, the Warriors are 24 of 74 from 3-point range. Curry has 16 of the made shots. ""We're just not executing,"" Green said.","401070720"
"BOSTON -- The way things went on the road for the Orlando Magic last season, one of the final two 3-point attempts by Boston probably would have gone in. But it's a new season and the ball bounced the right way in the closing seconds for Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 12 rebounds and the Magic survived two 3-point attempts by Boston in the final seconds to beat the Celtics 93-90 on Monday night. ""We definitely held our breath,'' Vucevic said of the second 3-point attempt. ""Once it hit the rim and I looked at the clock, it was almost over and I was like, 'All right, we're good.''' Jonathan Isaac added 18 points and 12 boards for the Magic (2-2), who went just 8-33 on the road last season, losing 25 of their final 28. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics (2-2) with 22 points. Al Horford had 15 and Gordon Hayward 11. Irving and Hayward each missed a 3 in the final seconds. ""It had a chance for sure,'' Hayward said. ""It was a good look. Kind of the story of the night, we had a bunch of good looks and just didn't knock them down.'' The Celtics, who never led in the game, trailed by at least five points from the midway point of the final quarter until Jaylen Brown nailed a 3-pointer from the left corner, closing it to 89-86 with 71 seconds left. But Isaac answered with a foul-line jumper on the next possession. Horford and Irving then had consecutive baskets 32 seconds apart, slicing it to 91-90 with 14.2 seconds to play. With Boston forced to foul Evan Fournier after Orlando inbounded the ball after a timeout, he stepped to the line and made both free throws with 7.8 seconds left. Irving then missed his 3 from the right corner, and after Horford grabbed the rebound and fed it out -- Hayward's rimmed out just before the buzzer sounded. ""I was beating myself up that Horford got that rebound,'' Isaac said. ""I was trying my best to box him out. I was like 'No don't let them end the game like this or don't let them come back.''' Orlando had pulled ahead by 13 points twice late in the third quarter before Boston closed the period by scoring 10 of the final 12 points to slice it to 75-70 at the break. SEATED COURTSIDE Red Sox star Mookie Betts walked into the arena early in the second quarter and watched from a courtside seat across from Boston's bench. Later in the quarter, the Celtics moved him to a seat right next to their bench. GETTING STARTED Robert Williams, the Celtics' first-round pick in this year's NBA draft, made his debut, playing 3 minutes in the third quarter without getting anything on his stat line. LONG MISSES Both teams were ice-cold from beyond the arc. The Celtics missed 31 of 40 and the Magic 25 of 35. ""Sometimes when you don't make it early, you can feel the tension,'' Boston coach Brad Stevens said. TIP-INS Magic: C Timofey Mozgov was inactive for the fourth consecutive game with a sore right knee. ... Vucevic was 11-of-18 from the floor and Isaac 8-of-12.

"TORONTO --  A tough Toronto Raptors defense took the sting out of Charlotte's 3-point shooting. Kawhi Leonard scored 22 points, Kyle Lowry had 16 points and a season-high 14 assists, and Toronto never trailed in a 127-106 victory over the Hornets on Monday night, the Raptors' fourth straight win to open the season. ""It was a high-scoring, free-shooting team coming in here,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We asked them to get out and contest and disrupt some of their rhythm stuff and we did a pretty good job of that."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 17 points, Danny Green had 16, and Serge Ibaka added 15 as the Raptors won their fifth straight over the Hornets. The Raptors have won nine of the past 11 meetings. ""We just were not sharp enough or physical enough defensively,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. Toronto is the first NBA team to reach four wins. Denver (3-0) can match the Raptors when it hosts Sacramento on Tuesday. The Hornets entered having made an NBA-best 49 3-pointers through their first three games, but struggled from long range against the Raptors. Charlotte finished 9 for 28 from beyond the arc. ""You've got to give those guys a lot of credit, they played great defense,"" Hornets guard Kemba Walker. ""But at the same time, I thought we got some pretty good looks. They just didn't drop."" Charlotte went 0 for 5 from 3-point range in the opening quarter, the first time in any quarter this season they've failed to make at least one basket from long range. ""We had some good looks early that didn't go,"" Borrego said. ""Had those dropped early, we might have had a different outcome in the first half at least."" The Raptors, meanwhile, made a season-best 15 3-pointers. Toronto's 39 attempts was the most in a game, so far. Leonard returned after sitting out Saturday night's road win over Washington, the second game of a back-to-back. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year was limited to nine games last season because of a quadriceps injury. ""He's still not back to where he was, but there are glimpses,"" said guard Danny Green, Leonard's former teammate with San Antonio. Leonard was not available to speak to reporters following the game because he was working out. Walker scored 26 points and Jeremy Lamb had 16 as the Hornets suffered their first road loss of the season. Charlotte won at Orlando on Friday and beat Miami on Saturday. ""I thought we could have been better, but that's a great team,"" Walker said. ""They played well together."" Nicolas Batum scored 13 points, Willy Hernangomez had 11 and Malik Monk added 10 for the Hornets. Before the game, Walker was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging NBA-bests of 35.3 points and 6.3 3-pointers. Walker's 19 3-pointers through the first three games set an NBA record. ""It's a credit to his work ethic, who he is as a person, a competitive spirit he has,"" Borrego said. ""We're in a good place with Kemba Walker."" HELPING HAND Toronto recorded a season-high 36 assists on 50 made baskets, three shy of the franchisee-high. The Raptors had 24 assists in Friday's win over Boston. ALL ABOARD All 13 Raptors players recorded at least one made basket, and 12 of the 13 had at least one assist.

"MILWAUKEE --  Khris Middleton is finding plenty of freedom and fun in the Milwaukee Bucks' wide-open offense. Middleton sank 7 of 8 3-pointers and finished with 30 points -- including two critical 3s down the stretch -- as the Bucks held off the New York Knicks 124-113 on Monday night. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 15 rebounds and Eric Bledsoe added 16 points and 13 assists for the Bucks, who are 3-0 for the first time since 2005-06. ""There are so many interchangeable parts with the offense,"" Middleton said. ""Sharing the ball, moving the ball. The pace is crazy. But it's been fun. ""There are so many opportunities and different looks we get out of the offense."" Middleton's 3-pointer with 2:22 left gave the Bucks a 116-110 lead, and he sank another off a pick-and-roll with Brook Lopez to make it 122-113. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said he believes Middleton can be an elite 3-point shooter. The 6-foot-8 veteran is 15-for-23 (65 percent) from beyond the arc this season. ""We feel like he puts a lot of work and time into his craft,"" Budenholzer said. ""We're going to create great opportunities for everybody, including Khris. And he's done it before."" Antetokounmpo only had one 3, but it came in a big spot, giving Milwaukee the lead for good midway through the fourth period. He scored 16 points in the final quarter while playing through contact in the paint. ""I just want to win,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I tried to play harder, tried to get on my spots. It's the third game of the season. New coach, new game plan. ""I'm just trying to figure it out. And I will. And when I do, it's going to be so easy and I'm going to be a beast out there."" Tim Hardaway Jr. led the Knicks with 24 points. Trey Burke added 19 and Mario Hezonja had 18. New York outscored the Bucks 35-17 in the third quarter to pull within one point, led by Burke's 13-point outburst in the period. But the Knicks were outscored 36-26 in the fourth. ""This is the suffering you must go through to become a good basketball team,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""The best part about it is our guys found a way to make it a basketball game."" Middleton sank three consecutive 3-pointers to give the Bucks a 58-43 lead midway through the second quarter. He finished with 19 points in the half as Milwaukee rolled to a 71-52 lead. The Bucks made 10 of 20 3-pointers in the half, with Middleton making all four of his attempts. Milwaukee finished 17 of 40 from distance, giving them 48 3s on the season, the most in franchise history over a three-game stretch. ""You've got to pick your poison with that group,"" said Hardaway, who played under Budenholzer in Atlanta. ""Not only can they shoot the ball, they've got guys that can get into the paint whenever they want against any team. ""Coach (Budenholzer) gives them that freedom. They're going to be a force to be reckoned with."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York played without rookie forward Kevin Knox, who sprained his left ankle in a 103-101 loss at Boston on Saturday. ... Fizdale said he isn't ready to make a change in the starting lineup. Burke and Hardaway started in the backcourt, with Frank Ntilikina and Lance Thomas at forward and Enes Kanter at center. ""We're still going to make people work for it and earn it,"" Fizdale said. ""At the same time, I'm still looking at the next couple games. Then at some point, if I see a fit, I'm going to make a change."" Bucks: Third-year center Thon Maker was active for the first time this season and D.J. Wilson and Christian Wood were inactive. Maker did not play. ... Budenholzer said he likes his bench options, including rookie Donte DiVincenzo and veteran Ersan Ilyasova. ""His defense always stands out to me,"" the coach said of Ilyasova, who played under Budenholzer in Atlanta. ""He can guard big 5s. Offensively he has a knack for playing and it marries up with how we want to play."" Ilyasova had 10 points and eight rebounds in 22 minutes on Monday.","401070723"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Through the first three games of the season, the Minnesota Timberwolves were not playing the type of defense that head coach Tom Thibodeau wanted to see. That changed Monday night. Minnesota clamped down on the defensive end against Indiana as Jimmy Butler returned to the lineup to score 20 points to lead the Timberwolves to a 101-91 win over the Pacers. ""We played a little bit of defense finally,"" Butler said. ""It felt good."" Butler, who received a mix of boos and cheers during player introductions, sat out Saturday due to precautionary rest. Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota, while rookie guard Josh Okogie scored 12 points off the bench. Minnesota also played most of Monday's game without forward Andrew Wiggins, who exited in the first quarter due to a right quad contusion and did not return. Wiggins scored two points in eight minutes before the injury. Thibodeau said Wiggins is day-to-day and the team will know more Tuesday about the injury. Wiggins, a Toronto native, indicated that he'll play Wednesday at the Raptors. Okogie saw his minutes increase in Wiggins' absence. Okogie made the most of the extended playing time and the home crowd at Target Center gave the rookie a nice ovation as he took a seat on the bench late in the fourth quarter. While Okogie struggled from the floor early, he kept shooting at the behest of his teammates -- and his head coach. ""I just like the way he sort of persevered through it,"" Thibodeau said of Okogie. ""I thought the spirit of the team was strong. His teammates were encouraging him to shoot, and he just kept playing, which I think is important."" The Wolves led by as many as nine early before Indiana cut it to one point at the half. Victor Oladipo scored 15 of his 20 points before halftime to lead the Pacers. He has now scored at least 20 points in three straight games. Bojan Bogdanovic also had 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting for the Pacers, while Myles Turner chipped in 16. ""I feel like overall, they kinda forced us into some tough shots as well,"" Oladipo said. ""Credit them, they did a pretty good job defensively."" Minnesota's reserves went on a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter and take an 84-73 lead -- its biggest of the game. Derrick Rose scored four of his 11 points during the run to put the Wolves ahead after they trailed by one entering the fourth. After allowing 140 points in a loss Saturday to Dallas, Minnesota's defense tightened Monday against a Pacers team that scored 132 points its last time out. The Wolves held Indiana to just 38.8 percent shooting from the floor in the first half. The 91 points allowed was the first time Minnesota held a team under 100 this season. Indiana shot over 55 percent in two of its first three games before shooting 39.6 percent on Monday. ""I thought our shot collection was poor,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""We didn't have ball movement. Basically we were taking quick shots and taking quick, contested shots."" TIP-INS Pacers: F Domantas Sabonis returned to action Monday after missing Saturday's game against Brooklyn. Sabonis had eight points in 17 minutes off the bench. ... Indiana assigned C Ike Anigbogu to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA G League on Monday. Anigbogu played three minutes Saturday. Wolves: C Karl-Anthony Towns had 17 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. ... F Taj Gibson's 3-pointer in the first quarter Monday marked the first time he connected from downtown since Dec. 31, 2017, which also came against Indiana. COLD FROM DEEP The Timberwolves struggled from 3-point range in Monday's game, finishing 7-for-33 from behind the arc. They were just 3-of-26 after three quarters before shooting 4-of-7 in the fourth. PUSHING THE TEMPO Minnesota led Indiana in fast break points, 26-8. Much of that was a result of the Wolves' ability to get stops on the defensive end and turn the ball up the floor quickly. Ten of those fast break points came in the fourth quarter. ""Our stops got us into the open floor,"" Thibodeau said.","401070724"
"DALLAS --  DeAndre Jordan was a double-double machine before and after he stiffed the Dallas Mavericks in free agency three years ago. Now that the Texas native finally decided to join the Mavericks, the 6-11 center is up to the same old tricks. Jordan became the first Dallas player in 24 years to start a season with three straight double-doubles, getting 18 points and 16 rebounds to help the Mavericks beat the Chicago Bulls 115-109 on Monday night. ""He's just been sensational,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He's giving us a major presence on the inside. You add the personality and attitude that he brings to the game. On a night like tonight, you don't get over the top without it."" Luka Doncic scored 19 in the 19-year-old's second home game, another win that put the Mavericks (2-1) over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2015-16 season. Zach LaVine scored 34 for the Bulls and is the third Chicago player to open a season with three straight 30-point games. The others were Michael Jordan in 1986 and Bob Love in 1971. The Bulls are 0-3 for the second straight year, losing two nights after a two-point loss in their home opener following a blowout defeat in Philadelphia. ""We did a good job,"" said LaVine, who was 5 of 7 from 3-point range. ""It hurts just to know that you have two winnable games. Made mistakes, but I guess that's just part of the game. It's upsetting."" Wesley Matthews led six Dallas players in double figures with 20 points. Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney-Smith scored 12 apiece. J.J. Barea scored nine, including a long 3-pointer just before the third-quarter buzzer. The 30-footer, Barea's only make in seven shots behind the arc, was part of a 14-2 run covering the third and fourth quarters for a 96-86 lead after neither team had been up by more than five. Jordan secured his third double-double on the first of two straight offensive rebounds before finishing off the putback with the Mavs down five in the third quarter. The last Dallas player with three straight double-doubles to start a season was Popeye Jones in 1994. Jordan is averaging 17 points and 12.2 rebounds. ""I'm just trying to do my job,"" said Jordan, who has had at least 41 double-doubles each of the past five seasons. ""Whenever Dennis (Smith Jr.) and Wes and J.J.  and Luka, our playmakers, make a play when I roll to the basket, I just try to finish and take what the defense gives us."" Chicago cut a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to five in the final minute, but Doncic, the third overall pick, collected a bad pass by No. 7 overall choice Wendell Carter Jr. in the backcourt after a Dallas miss and hit the layup. Jabari Parker scored 20 points for Chicago but had just four after halftime. Doncic led the Mavericks with six assists, including a nifty one to Jordan that included a fake in the first half. NEW DAD'S DEBUT Kris Dunn had nine points of 4-of-13 shooting with seven assists before fouling out late in his debut. The Chicago guard missed the first two games for the birth of his first child. ""First half, I was solid,"" Dunn said. ""Second half, I got a little winded and careless."" BACK AND FORTH There were 12 lead changes in the first half, including on seven straight buckets early in the second quarter. The last was on a 3-pointer by LaVine for a 47-45 Chicago lead. There were three more ties before halftime, with Cameron Payne hitting a floater in the final minute to put the Bulls up 61-59 at the break. The game finished with 17 lead changes. CHOICE WORD, TECH Robin Lopez wasn't happy with referee Sean Corbin's explanation after the Chicago center was called for a foul when he got tangled with Dwight Powell in the first quarter. Lopez appeared upset that Corbin said he was ""trying to help"" the big man from Stanford, and Lopez used the word ""platitudes"" in his retort. The big word was preceded by an expletive, and Corbin signaled for a technical foul. TIP-INS Bulls: Carter was overshadowed by Doncic in the matchup of top 10 picks from this year's draft. He finished with four points, but did lead the Bulls with nine rebounds. ... Justin Holliday scored 16 points, and Bobby Portis had 12. Mavericks: Doncic became youngest Dallas player to record a 20-point game with 26 in his home debut, a 140-136 win over Minnesota. He beat Smith, who did it as a rookie last November, by 113 days. ... Harrison Barnes (hamstring) and Dirk Nowitzki (ankle) are still awaiting their season debuts. Devin Harris missed a second straight game with a hamstring injury.","401070725"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Memphis Grizzlies took a page out of their classic playbook, using hard-nosed defense and a controlled pace on offense to top the Utah Jazz. Mike Conley had 23 points and Marc Gasol finished with 18 points as Memphis earned its first road win of the season, beating the Jazz 92-84 Monday night. The Grizzlies prevailed despite shooting 36.9 percent (31 of 84). ""It says we've got a lot of grit on this team,"" Conley said. ""We've got a lot of guys who've got a lot to prove, play with a lot of energy. We play together. We stick together through adversity.""

Utah could not find its outside shot and struggled to get an edge inside with Gasol disrupting things around the basket. ""I think that we had spurts where we got stagnant,"" Mitchell said. ""Just little things. I think that they took us out of what we wanted to do. That can't happen."" A trio of 3-pointers from Shelvin Mack and Wayne Seldin fueled a 16-4 run for Memphis in the fourth quarter. Garrett Temple capped the outburst with a layup that gave Grizzlies an 86-70 lead with 3:49 remaining. Gobert converted a three-point play and Utah whittled its deficit to 88-82 with 50.9 seconds left. The Jazz had a chance to make it a one possession game, but Mitchell missed a 3-pointer with 22.4 seconds left. It was a fitting end to a sloppy offensive outing for Utah. ""The substance of this team is the fact that we move the ball and work together to get good shots and we didn't do that tonight,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We got some good looks but consistently we didn't move the ball like we need to and make the extra pass. We can't play that way."" Neither offense generated much in the first half. Memphis shot just 41.5 percent from the floor over the first two quarters. The Jazz connected on 38.6 percent of their shots in the first half. Utah led by five points twice in the first quarter. The Jazz went up 14-9 on back-to-back baskets by Joe Ingles, and then 22-17 on consecutive dunks from Dante Exum and Derrick Favors. Memphis pulled ahead early in the second quarter with a 13-4 run. Jaren Jackson fueled the run with a pair of hook shots and a free throw, helping the Grizzlies take a 32-26 lead. Utah briefly rallied when Mitchell drove for a layup and sank a jumper on back-to-back possessions, giving the Jazz a 41-40 lead. The Grizzlies pulled back in front before halftime and built up a 10-point third quarter lead, going up 66-56 on a pair of free throws from Conley.

BACK ON BOARDS Marc Gasol collected as many rebounds against the Jazz as he totaled in his first two games combined. Gasol averaged just 6.5 rebounds in his first two games. His effort on the glass went a long way for the Grizzlies in combating Utah's frontcourt duo of Gobert and Favors. ""He's kind of the horse that pulls the plow,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Time and time again, when called upon, he goes out and does the job."" FREE THROW ACCURACY Through three games, Utah is proving to be a consistent team at the line.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Markieff Morris couldn't believe the Blazers kept leaving him open. Morris had 28 points, including a career-high six 3-pointers, and the Washington Wizards won their first game of the season with a 125-124 overtime victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. ""After the second (3-pointer) I was like, `Are they really gonna let me shoot the ball?' I think that's the most I ever shot,"" Morris said. ""I was playing (Jusuf) Nurkic and he couldn't cover the pick and roll and the three so they just had to give something up."" Bradley Beal added 25 points for the Wizards, and Otto Porter Jr. blocked Damian Lillard's layup attempt at the final buzzer to seal the win. There were 29 lead changes and 23 ties. Lillard had 29 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Trail Blazers, who lost their first game after opening the season 2-0. Morris had a layup and a free throw to put the Wizards ahead 120-117 in overtime. Lillard's layup got Portland closer, but Morris landed a 3-pointer with 38.5 seconds left. Lillard's jumper got Portland within a basket before John Wall's 17-footer with 10.1 second left looked to all but seal it for the Wizards. CJ McCollum made it interesting with a 3-pointer for the Blazers and Wall missed a pair of free throws, but Porter blocked Lillard's attempt to win it with a layup at the buzzer. ""The kind of effort we had, we put ourselves in position to win the game,"" Lillard said. ""We just didn't execute, on the defensive end or the offensive end, as good as we needed to to win it. That's frustrating."" Nurkic finished with 22 points and 18 rebounds for the Blazers. The game was close throughout the second half. Portland led 102-97 with 3:08 left but the Wizards pulled in front 105-103 on Morris' 3-pointer. Lillard's 3-pointer tied it again at 108 with 52.2 second left. Nik Stauskas hit a 3-pointer to put Portland ahead with 13 seconds left. But Beal made a 3 for the Wizards with 7.4 seconds to go to tie it again and the game went to overtime. Blazers coach Terry Stotts praised Morris. ""That was a tough matchup with guarding the pick and roll with him. We brought Moe (Harkless) in and they went down to the post. He had a terrific game, inside and out."" It was the first of a five-game road trip for the Wizards, who lost two at home to open the season, including a 117-113 loss to Toronto on Saturday night. Beal scored 32 points and became the career leader in 3-pointers in the loss and coach Scott Brooks was ejected on a technical. Washington continues to await the season debut of Dwight Howard, who missed all of training camp with gluteal soreness.

After trailing most of the third quarter, Portland pulled back in front on Evan Turner's short jumper from out front that made it 75-74. But it was short-lived and the Wizards led 78-77 heading into the final quarter. TIP INS Wizards: The two teams split their series 1-1 last season. ... The Wizards also won their last two games at the Moda Center. Trail Blazers: It was an early Halloween for the Blazers, who arrived at the Moda Center in Halloween costumes. Lillard arguably won the night as Stone Cold Steve Austin. Harkless was dressed as Chappelle Show character Tyrone Biggums. GOING SMALL: Wizards coach Scott Brooks saw success with a smaller lineup against the Blazers. ""We're definitely going to play it for long stretches,"" Brooks said.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors got back to their pass-happy ways and coach Steve Kerr could smile again about all those assists, fewer fouls and a better night taking care of the ball. ""We understand what the keys to our success are and when we don't do them we make the game extremely tough and give the other team life in terms of more possessions,"" Curry said. Curry scored 15 of his 29 points in the third quarter and also had eight assists, leading the Warriors past the Phoenix Suns 123-103 on Monday night. Kevin Durant scored 22 points and Draymond Green dished out eight of 35 assists for the two-time defending NBA champions. Kerr had been disappointed in his team's passing, rushed shots and ball movement so far. He is pleased with the progress: The Warriors shot 51.1 percent in the second of a back-to-back following a two-point loss at Denver on Sunday, which came after a one-point win Friday at Utah. ""That looked like our team, just the purpose of each possession, driving and kicking and trying to get guys better shots,"" he said. The Warriors won a 16th straight against Phoenix, their longest unbeaten run against a team in franchise history. Golden State's 14 straight home victories versus the Suns is a franchise mark, as well. Klay Thompson scored 16 points but missed his initial four 3-point tries and finished 1 of 6 from deep, making him 3 for 22 through four games. He sustained what is considered a mild ankle sprain, telling Kerr he could have returned. New Golden State starting center Damian Jones dunked three times in the initial 4:03 -- a pair of them on alley-oops -- and Durant had one in transition, too. Phoenix called timeout down 12-7 at the 7:34 mark after KD's slam. Jones also added an early three-point play on a putback and finished with 13 points. He had nine and four rebounds in the opening eight minutes. Devin Booker scored 28 points, TJ Warren had 27 off the bench and Deandre Ayton added 20 points and 14 rebounds for Phoenix.

Curry shot 11 for 18 with six 3-pointers. He had scored 30 or more points in each of his initial three games this season but didn't play the entire fourth quarter Monday.

Phoenix won at Oracle Arena during the preseason. Warriors: Reserve G Shaun Livingston sat out with a bruised left knee. ... The Warriors are averaging 119.8 points during the winning streak against the Suns. ... Golden State's first three games were decided by 11 total points. ... The Warriors completed the first set of 13 back-to-backs -- which will be their fewest total since the NBA began an 82-game schedule in 1967-68. COUSINS UPDATE Center DeMarcus Cousins will begin doing more ""controlled aspects"" of team drills during practice, increasing from the extensive individual work he has largely been limited to so far during his recovery from surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon. Cousins still won't be rushed into full scrimmaging but perhaps some light work when the young players scrimmage, Kerr said. ""He's doing fine, he's doing well,"" Kerr said. Cousins has been a big support for Jones, hopping off the bench to encourage the third-year pro and offering insight during timeouts. UNICYCLE GIFT Rong Niu, the Red Panda halftime performer, received a new custom-made unicycle courtesy of the Warriors and it was presented by team President and COO Rick Welts. Niu's previous unicycle was stolen in January from the luggage area at San Francisco International Airport. Niu let out a ""Yeah!"" and pumped her fist after successfully flipping the bowls onto her head. Afterward, an emotional Red Panda took a bow, brought the house down, and said, ""Thank you so much!"" ""She's been amazing. She's one of the great halftime acts in sports,"" Kerr said. ""So I think that's great she'll be here tonight. I will ask for a report from you guys afterward because I'll be busy at halftime. I'm happy that she got her bike back.""","401070728"
"Lakers head coach Luke Walton criticizes the lack of free throws for the Lakers and others getting rewarded for ""flopping 30 feet from the hole."" (1:09) LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James hit the tying 3-pointer late in regulation. He led a Lakers lineup of three second-year pros and a rookie making his NBA debut to a 142-136 lead with 55 seconds left overtime. James was then reminded in spectacular fashion that nothing will be easy in this West Coast chapter of his career. Patty Mills hit a go-ahead jumper with 6.8 seconds left and the San Antonio Spurs kept the Lakers winless with LeBron, rallying from a six-point deficit in the final minute of OT for a wild 143-142 victory Monday night. James tied it on a magisterial 3 with 2.4 seconds left in regulation, and he finished his second Lakers home game with 32 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds. But the superstar missed two free throws with 12.8 seconds to play before Mills coolly put the Spurs ahead. James then missed a step-back 3-pointer at the buzzer, thoroughly deflating Staples Center as the Lakers fell to the first 0-3 start in James' career since his second season with Cleveland in 2004-05. After cooling down, LeBron did not seem discouraged by the Lakers' last-minute failure against a quality opponent -- and while Los Angeles was missing suspended starters Rajon Rondo and Brandon Ingram . ""It's not"" discouraging, James said. ""I know what I got myself into,"" he added. ""It's a process. I get it, and we'll be fine. I didn't come here thinking we were going to be blazing, storming right out of the gate. It's a process, and I understand that."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 37 points and 10 rebounds, and DeMar DeRozan added 32 points and 14 assists before Mills made the biggest shot. The Australian guard did it while playing Tony Parker's traditional role on a familiar San Antonio play. ""It's always good when you make shots or make an impact,"" Mills said. ""Other than that shot, it was a team victory. It was a gutsy win. Everyone participated."" Kyle Kuzma had 37 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers, and Josh Hart added 20 points and 10 rebounds. James' dramatic 3 from a full step beyond the arc capped the Lakers' improbable rally from an eight-point deficit in the final 1:04 of regulation. The Lakers then took a 142-136 lead late in overtime with huge contributions from unsung rookie big man Johnathan Williams, who played important minutes in his NBA debut after JaVale McGee fouled out. But the Lakers sputtered and the Spurs rallied. Rudy Gay's 3-pointer cut the Lakers' lead to 142-141, and James missed his free throws before the jumper by Mills, who had 12 points. ""It's always fun to play close games and have them be that type of atmosphere, and overly competitive,"" Aldridge said. ""It was nice to get a close win. It just builds character and makes guys be more confident."" TIP-INS Spurs: Dante Cunningham had three points and 12 rebounds in 29 minutes as a starter. Jakob Poeltl, who started the first two games, didn't play. ... Marco Belinelli scored 15 points in a reserve role for the Spurs, and Rudy Gay had 16 points. Lakers: Svi Mykhailiuk and Williams made their NBA debuts in the shortened rotation. Mykhailiuk went scoreless in 17 minutes, but he got an assist on Williams' dunk for his first NBA bucket. Williams finished with eight points. NO CALLS Lakers coach Luke Walton was infuriated by the officiating which gave 38 free throws to the Spurs and just 26 to Los Angeles, even though the Lakers outscored San Antonio 74-50 in the paint. Walton got a technical foul in the second quarter for protesting a no-call on contact with James, but his postgame complaints were multifold. McGee was fouled out after scoring 16 points, and Ivica Zubac was called for five fouls in less than five minutes. Hart, an aggressive driver to the hoop, wasn't given a free throw in nearly 39 minutes of action. ""I know they're young, I get that,"" an animated Walton said. ""But if we're going to play a certain way, let's not reward people for flopping 30 feet from the hole on plays that have nothing to do with that possession ... and then not reward players that are physically going to the basket and getting hit. It's not right."" BANNED BALLERS Ingram and Rondo began their suspensions stemming from their brawl with the Houston Rockets last Saturday. Ingram got a four-game ban for confronting an official and throwing punches, while Rondo got three games for punching and spitting on Chris Paul. THE REPLACEMENTS Kuzma and Lonzo Ball were in the starting lineup in their teammates' absence, and both second-year pros excelled. Kuzma finished one point shy of his career high, while Ball had 14 points, six assists and six rebounds. ""We've just got to get over the hump,"" Kuzma said. ""It'll be a breath of fresh air when we get our first win. The three teams we've played, they've all been together for quite some time. That means something.""","401070729"
"DETROIT --  Blake Griffin has heard the critics, but the veteran forward knows it'll take more nights like Tuesday to get where his team wants to go. Griffin scored a career-high 50 points and had the game-winner after he was fouled on a driving layup with 1.8 seconds left as Detroit topped Philadelphia 133-132 in a wild overtime thriller. Riddled with injuries during his last few years with the Los Angeles Clippers and then traded last season by his first pro team, Griffin has talked this offseason after proving something. Point proven. ""The past two or three years, all I hear about is how bad I am,"" Griffin said. ""It's a big win, but we've got to move on. This is game three and now we've got to move on to game four."" The Pistons are 3-0 for the first time since 2015-16, the last time they made the playoffs, topping the 76ers, who were without Ben Simmons, nursing back tightness. JJ Redick's four-point play with 5.6 seconds left in overtime set up Griffin's dramatics, while Joel Embiid, who had 33 points and 11 rebounds, missed a potential game-winner at the buzzer after working a two-man game with Redick. ""We were trying to bait the switch, you know maybe slip Joel to the rim, maybe step him out,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""Joel had an open look and just wasn't able to knock it down."" Griffin faked a handoff on the final play and drove the lane for the basket, getting fouled by Robert Covington. He made the ensuing free throw. ""Out of all the great players I worked with, Dirk (Nowitzki), Kyle Lowry, Kevin Garnett, Shawn Kemp, all those guys, he's playing at that high a level right now,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""But again that is what we expect from Blake because he is that good of a player."" Griffin was 20 of 35 from the field, going 5 for 10 on 3-pointers, scoring his most points as a member of the Pistons for the second straight game. He missed his first six free throws of the game. ""It starts with like believing,"" Griffin said. ""I saw a lot of times last year where guys were kind of like defeated. Everybody stayed positive, and that was huge."" And Griffin stayed hot. He dunked on Embiid with 3:50 to go in the second quarter, a frame where he scored 22 points. ""Some of us tried to stop him, and he just had an amazing day,"" said Dario Saric, who scored 14 points for Philly. ""We tried everything but sometimes you can't, you know?"" Redick had 30 points and scored a 3-pointer while being fouled by Reggie Jackson after the Pistons point guard made two free throws to take a 130-128 lead. Jackson had 23 points and Ish Smith scored 21 for the Pistons. Detroit took the lead for the first time since late in the first quarter as two Griffin free throws put the Pistons up 111-110 with 3:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. Then, down the stretch of regulation, the teams traded the lead six times, with three ties. With the teams tied 120-all, Embiid missed a 3-pointer and Reggie Bullock missed a runner in the lane. On the final play of regulation, Saric had an open look on a 3-pointer but missed it in the closing seconds. TIP-INS 76ers: Rookie guard Landry Shamet made his first career start for Philadelphia.

Mike Muscala, acquired in a three-team trade from Atlanta this offseason, made his debut of for the 76ers after missing the first three games with a sprained ankle. He scored five points in 17 minutes. Pistons: Andre Drummond was ejected with 40.8 seconds left in regulation after his second technical foul. . Glenn Robinson III, acquired as a free agent from Indiana, did not play after logging 33 minutes combined in the first two games. BEN'S BAD BACK Brown said Simmons is questionable for Wednesday at Milwaukee after leaving Saturday's game against Orlando in the first quarter. ""He didn't feel as comfortable as we would've wanted,"" Brown said. ""It's just one of those things that with a back-to-back game and giving him the best chance we could give him to possibly play (Wednesday), we felt like it was wise to sit him tonight."" CAREER NIGHT Starting at point guard with Simmons out, Markelle Fultz tied his career high with 13 points. He knocked down a long two-pointer for the game's first points and later making his second career 3-pointer.

""Not the defense we hoped for but we're not going to hold everyone under 100."" Jamal Murray scored 14 of his 19 points in the third quarter and Nikola Jokic had 14 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Nuggets, who have won their first four games for the first time since starting 5-0 in 2009-10.

""It's a long season but we're going to ride the momentum while we've got it."" The Nuggets remained unbeaten despite allowing a team to break the century mark in points for the first time this season. The Nuggets held opponents to an NBA-best 95.7 points in the first three games but simply outscored Sacramento, which entered Tuesday second in the NBA in scoring at 125.7 points a game. Gary Harris scored 18 points and Paul Millsap added 15 for Denver. ""They are a tough team to play, they're physical and they take care of their home court,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They have found a nice rhythm."" Denver's early defense helped build a 13-point halftime lead that grew to as much as 26 in the third quarter. Jokic, who was named the NBA Western Conference player of the week on Monday, had 11 points and 10 rebounds at halftime. He hit a 3-pointer to start the third quarter and then Murray took over.

"ATLANTA --  Trae Young struggled through three forgettable quarters, hardly the sort of debut he was hoping for in Atlanta. Then, with the game on the line, the rookie showed why the Hawks are counting on him to be the face of the franchise. Kent Bazemore scored a career-high 32 points, Young bounced back in the final period and the youthful Hawks rallied from a 26-point deficit to stun the Dallas Mavericks 111-104 Wednesday night. To show how much Young means to Atlanta in only his fourth NBA game, Taurean Prince pulled the rookie aside with about 4 minutes remaining and the outcome very much in doubt. ""Get it going,"" Prince told the 20-year-old guard. ""We're going to follow you."" That's just what the Hawks did. Young scored 12 of his 17 points in the final quarter, spinning away from Dennis Smith Jr. with an electrifying move and getting to the line over and over again. ""That was some grown-man stuff right there,"" Bazemore said. ""I'm proud of him for hanging in there."" Young emerged victorious in his rookie showdown with Luca Doncic, who finished with 21 points but hit only 3 of 10 shots over the final two quarters. ""Some people are going to say he scored more points than me, so that makes him better,"" Young said. ""At the end of the day, I'm just glad my team won. That's the main thing for me."" The Hawks made it a night to remember at newly rechristened State Farm Arena, which hosted its first game after a $192.5 million renovation. The crowd spent much of the first half enjoying the amenities, including a barber shop overlooking the court, but really got into the game as the home team kept creeping closer and closer. ""Thank you Atlanta,"" Young told the fans after the game. ""This is just the beginning."" Coming off a 35-point, 11-assist performance in a victory at Cleveland, Young struggled with his shot, got into a bit of foul trouble and kept turning the ball over, helping Dallas race to a 51-25 lead only 4 minutes into the second quarter. But the Hawks turned things around before halftime, closing to 58-48 at the break, and they finally passed the Mavs when Young was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 5:13 remaining. He swished all three free throws, putting Atlanta ahead for the first time all night, 96-95. Bazemore finished with a flourish , spotting an opening down the middle of the lane and jamming it through with the left hand to make it 105-101 with 1:06 remaining. ""I haven't seen that since high school,"" Bazemore said with a grin. ""It was like the Red Sea parting."" The Mavericks equaled the third-biggest blown lead in franchise history. ""We took our foot off the gas,"" Wesley Matthews said. ""We thought it was going to be an easy game. Credit them. They didn't quit."" FOREVER LINKED Young and Doncic are likely to be compared for the rest of their careers. The Hawks selected the 19-year-old Slovenian with the No. 3 overall pick, only to deal him to the Mavericks in exchange for Young, who was taken at No. 5. Atlanta also picked up 2019 first-round selection in the deal. DEDMON RETURNS Dewayne Dedmon made his season debut for the Hawks after missing the first three games recovering from left ankle injury. The 7-foot center played 14 minutes, sank a 3-pointer and grabbed five rebounds. TIP-INS Mavericks: Coach Rick Carlisle was asked before the game how his team could improve its defense against the 3-pointer. ""Get closer to them,"" he quipped.

"CLEVELAND --  Life without LeBron James has been harder so far than the Cleveland Cavaliers hoped. Cleveland fell to 0-4 after a 102-86 loss to Brooklyn on Wednesday night. D'Angelo Russell scored 18 points, Joe Harris added 16 and the Nets outscored the Cavaliers 38-17 in the third quarter to pull away. James led the Cavaliers to four straight NBA Finals and a championship in 2016, but the four-time MVP signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in the summer. His absence was obviously going to leave a void, but blowout losses at home to Atlanta and Brooklyn have been especially disappointing for the Cavs. ""We need a `W' on the board, for sure,"" said All-Star forward Kevin Love. ""Obviously we thought we'd be in a different position right now."" Love was one of three Cleveland players to score a team-high 14 points. The 11-year veteran said the Cavaliers didn't show any fight in the second half during their latest loss. ""These are big growing pains and we need to get through these,"" he said. ""Guys have to continue to fight. Can't hang their heads, can't have bad body language. This isn't the previous four years. We have to fight for everything that we've got."" The Cavaliers lost their first two games on the road to Toronto and Minnesota. Cleveland was coming off a 133-111 loss in its home opener to the Hawks. The Cavaliers are 0-4 for the first time since losing their first five games in 2003-04 when James was a rookie. Cleveland will face a difficult task Thursday with a road game against Detroit and Blake Griffin, who scored 50 points in an overtime win over Philadelphia on Tuesday. The first half had 11 lead changes and the teams were tied at 45 going to halftime before the Nets took over. Brooklyn hit 16 of 22 from the field in the third quarter to pull away. Harris made a 3-pointer that put the Nets up 50-47 and Brooklyn never trailed again. Jared Dudley's second 3-pointer of the run pushed the lead to 68-50 with 6:12 remaining in the quarter. ""Just by moving the basketball, we went from getting good shots to great shots,"" Harris said. ""As long as you're doing that, the shots are going to start falling. We're trying to build on games like this. Hopefully, we can keep it going."" The Nets maintained a lead over 20 points for most of the fourth quarter, causing many in the crowd at Quicken Loans to head for the exits. The Nets placed six players in double figures. Dudley scored 12 points. Jordan Clarkson and rookie Collin Sexton also scored 14 points for Cleveland. Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and guard Shabazz Napier made their season debuts. Jefferson, out with a hip injury and the birth of his first child, scored seven points in 17 minutes. Napier, sidelined with a strained right hamstring, scored eight points in 11 minutes. The Nets broke a 10-game losing streak in Cleveland and won for the first time at Quicken Loans Arena since April 3, 2013. TIP-INS Nets: F Rodions Kurucs (sprained left ankle) was unavailable and will not play Friday at New Orleans. Coach Kenny Atkinson said his status will be updated this weekend. ... F Treveon Graham (strained left hamstring) and F DeMarre Carroll (right ankle surgery) remain out. Cavaliers: Veterans Kyle Korver and J.R. Smith came off the bench in the first quarter after not playing Sunday. Korver had two points in 19 minutes while Smith scored seven points in 18 minutes... Cleveland was 6 of 26 from the field in the first quarter. ... Love had 10 points in the first half, the only Cleveland player to reach double figures in the first two quarters. EVEN START The Nets have split their first four games and Atkinson gave credit to the defense Wednesday. ""Holding a team to 86 points with Kevin Love and Rodney Hood and a lot of explosive scorers, that's a heck of a job by our guys,"" he said. MAKE A SHOT, PLEASE The Cavaliers were 3 of 18 on 3-point attempts Wednesday and have made 28 of 87 from behind the arc for the season. ""We have to make shots,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""If we're open for the 3, we have to let it go.""","401070734"
"MIAMI --  The Heat took advantage of a third-quarter stoppage in play Wednesday to show a video montage of highlights from Chris Bosh's years with the team, including his championship moments. It fired up the crowd. Seemed to fire up the Heat, too. With Bosh and his family watching from courtside, Hassan Whiteside scored 22 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, Josh Richardson added 21 points and Miami scored 45 points in the third quarter to fuel what became an easy 110-87 win over former Heat assistant David Fizdale and the New York Knicks. ""Kind of a weird night,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I love Fiz and I love CB."" That was on full display afterward. After the final horn, Fizdale lingered on the court and hugged several Heat coaches and players, with Dwyane Wade getting the last of those embraces. Wade presented Fizdale with one of his jerseys, leading to yet another hug between them. Meanwhile, Bosh had sauntered onto the court at that point, and Spoelstra grabbed him in a bear hug and lifted him off the ground. Just like old times, sort of. ""It's always special that you've got people who care about you, that you've invested a lot in and they've invested a lot in you,"" Fizdale said. ""I told Spo when we met at half-court, `That's no way to treat a friend. When I come to your house, you're not supposed to beat me like that."" Spoelstra knows Fizdale doesn't believe that. ""He would do the same to me,"" Spoelstra said. They would compete against each other in anything and everything when they worked together in Miami, even racing to see who could get to the door first. There wasn't much competition on Wednesday, as the Heat outscored the Knicks 76-38 in the middle two quarters. Rodney McGruder added 19 points on only eight shot attempts and Goran Dragic scored 13 points for the Heat. Miami's 45-point third tied the third-highest scoring period in franchise history, sparked by going 8 of 10 from 3-point range. ""We stepped on them and never looked back,"" McGruder said. Damyean Dotson scored 20 for New York, which got 14 from Tim Hardaway Jr. and 13 from Mario Hezonja. The Knicks were outscored 24-0 from 3-point range in that pivotal third quarter, missing all eight of their tries from beyond the arc. The 23-point margin of victory was Miami's fifth-largest ever against New York. The only good stretch for New York all night was late in the first quarter. The Knicks outscored Miami 14-0 in the final 2:33 of the quarter, a run sparked by back-to-back 3s by Hezonja and Dotson. That put New York up 27-16 after the first. After that, it was all Heat for much of the rest of the night. TIP-INS Knicks: New York didn't make a free throw until early in the third quarter. The Knicks were 0 for 2 from the line in the first half. ... Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) remained sidelined, and has yet to make his 2018-19 debut. Courtney Lee (neck spasms) was also out. He missed six games last season; he's missed five already this season. Heat: Duncan Robinson, whose college career started at Division III Williams before he wound up at Michigan, got his first NBA minutes -- and made his first shot, a 3-pointer. ... Miami has trailed by double digits in three of its first four games. The lone exception was last week's win at Washington, where the biggest deficit the Heat faced was nine points. ... The Heat outscored the Knicks by 25 points in the third, matching the sixth-best score differential in a quarter in franchise history. BANNER RETURNS Plenty of Heat greats were there. Tim Hardaway Sr., the father of the Knicks guard and one of three players to have his Heat jersey number swaying from the rafters in Miami, was at the game. So was Bosh and Jason Williams, the point guard from Miami's 2006 champions. GAME 2 Ashley Moyer-Gleich was one of the officials assigned to the game by the NBA. It was the second regular-season game for Gleich, who remains a non-staff official. She and fellow non-staff official Natalie Sago made their debuts on Monday.","401070735"
"TORONTO --  With his highest-scoring game of the season, Kawhi Leonard kept the Toronto Raptors rolling along. Leonard scored 35 points, Kyle Lowry had 13 points and 10 assists, and the Raptors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-105 on Wednesday night to improve to 5-0 and match the best start in franchise history. ""We're on the right track,"" Leonard said. ""We've won every game so far and we've just got to keep going."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 16 points, Serge Ibaka had 15 and Norman Powell added a season-high 10 for the Raptors, who also won five straight to start the 2015-16 season. ""They got points in the paint, they got open 3s, they got out in transition,"" Minnesota's Jimmy Butler said. ""We didn't take too many things away from them tonight and they capitalized at every opportunity."" Toronto won its 15th straight home game against Minnesota, extending its franchise record for consecutive home victories over a single opponent. The last time the Raptors lost at home to the Timberwolves was Jan. 21, 2004. Butler scored 23 points, Derrick Rose had 16 and Taj Gibson 13 for Minnesota, which has yet to win back-to-back games this season. ""We played from behind all night,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Minnesota guard Andrew Wiggins was inactive for only the second time in his career, sitting out because of a bruised right quadriceps. Wiggins, who is from suburban Toronto, left in the first quarter of Monday's win over Indiana and did not return. Rookie Josh Okogie started in place of Wiggins and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds. Leonard shot 15 for 23, going 2 for 4 from 3-point range, and had 10 points came in the fourth quarter. Butler said Leonard looks like the player he was before missing all but nine games because of injury last season. ""He's there,"" Butler said. ""He's shooting the ball with confidence. The athleticism is there, he's passing it well, guarding. I think he's going to be just fine here. ""When you have a team like they have and a player of his caliber, the game gets really easy for him and for everybody else,"" Butler added. Toronto was up by 17 points in the fourth but Towns scored to cut it to 106-101 with 1:16 remaining. Following a timeout, Leonard drove for a jumpshot over Rose, pushing the lead to seven. Minnesota called timeout and gave the ball to Jeff Teague, but his missed shot was rebounded by Ibaka. Leonard was fouled and made both, putting the Raptors up by nine points with 38 seconds to go. TIP-INS Timberwolves: The last time Wiggins was inactive was Nov. 10, 2015, when he sat out a loss to Charlotte because of a sore right knee. ... Teague led Minnesota with nine assists. ... All five Minnesota starters reached double figures in scoring. Raptors: G Delon Wright (left thigh) returned after missing the first four games of the season. Wright went scoreless in five first-half minutes but did not return following the intermission because of soreness in his groin. ... G Fred VanVleet (sprained left big toe) was inactive. ... Valanciunas matched a career high with two made 3-pointers. ... Lowry had six rebounds. ... Toronto outscored Minnesota 56-38 in the paint. DEAR MR. FANTASY Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns shot 5 for 17 and scored 14 points, but was more upset at the result than his poor shooting. ""A loss is a loss,"" Towns said. ""It's about winning. It's not about the statistical achievements, doing this or that for whoever my fantasy owner is."" CENTURY CLUB For the first time in franchise history, Toronto has won five straight games despite allowing 100 or more points in each. CAGED WOLVES Toronto is 30-15 against Minnesota, its best record against any opponent.","401070736"
"CHICAGO --  After missing one potential winning shot in the final seconds, Zach LaVine was determined to give himself another opportunity. He made good on the second chance. LaVine made two free throws with 0.5 seconds left to give the Chicago Bulls their first victory of the season, 112-110 over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. With the score tied at 110, LaVine missed a jumper with seven seconds left. Charlotte called time to set up a potential winning play, but LaVine forced a turnover on the inbounds pass, giving Chicago the ball back with five seconds to play. He was fouled driving to the basket to set up the winning free throws. He finished with 32 points for his fourth straight 30-point game to start the season. ""I wasn't going to miss again,"" LaVine said. ""They were going to have to foul me or I was going to get a dunk."" Cameron Payne scored all of his career-high 21 points in the second half, going 7 for 11 on 3 pointers for Chicago in the opener of the home-and-home set with the Hornets. Kemba Walker had 23 points on 5-for-14 shooting for Charlotte. ""I thought we missed some open looks, but they did a great job on the defensive end,"" Walker said. ""They play hard. They really deserve that win."" The Bulls had a 54-53 halftime lead mainly thanks to 35 bench points. Jabari Parker had nine, and Cristiano Felicio and Chandler Hutchison had eight apiece. The trio combined to go 10 for 14 from the field. Before Wednesday, Felicio hadn't played this season and Hutchison had a total of three points in two games. ""We just did not defend well enough in the first half,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""That was unacceptable defense. Especially when shots aren't falling, you got to be on your defense."" Chicago stretched the advantage to 85-74 with 2 1/2 minutes left in the third on a 3-pointer by Payne -- his fifth of the quarter. The lead was 88-78 with a minute remaining in the third before Charlotte ran off 11 straight points -- capped by Tony Parker's jumper -- to grab an 89-88 edge with 10 1/2 minutes to play in the fourth. After the teams traded baskets and the lead for a few minutes, the Hornets seemingly took control with a 103-98 lead with 5 1/2 left. The Bulls, though, rallied to tie it at 105 on a Payne 3-pointer with 3:34 to play. That set the stage for LaVine's stretch drive. ""I love his attack,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I love the way he goes after the rim and gets into the paint."" CAN'T MISS LaVine actually tried to miss the second free throw with 0.5 seconds left, but his awkward line drive bounced off the rim and through. ""That's crazy, right?"" he said. ""I really tried to miss that. It was only point-5 seconds left, so if I would have got it off the rim, the game would have been over."" KEEP SHOOTING Payne, starting in place of injured Kris Dunn, missed both of his shots in the first half before getting hot. ""My mentality was just to keep being aggressive and Zach kept finding me,"" Payne said. TIP-INS Hornets: Borrego, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Walker each were assessed technical fouls in the first half. Bulls: F Bobby Portis injured his right knee early in the fourth quarter and did not return. He is scheduled to have an MRI on Thursday ... Dunn sprained the MCL in his left knee on Monday against Dallas and will be sidelined four to six weeks. Dunn injured the knee in the second quarter, but continued to play, finishing with nine points and seven assists before fouling out.","401070737"
"HOUSTON --  Just four games into the season the Houston Rockets already have three losses, have dealt with the suspension of Chris Paul and now must wait to see if a hamstring injury will cause James Harden to miss any time. Donovan Mitchell scored 38 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 100-89 victory over the Rockets on Wednesday night in a game Harden left with what the team called tightness in his left hamstring. The Rockets got within five points midway through the fourth quarter but Harden headed to the locker room soon after and didn't return. With Harden out, the Jazz regained control, scoring the next 10 points to make it 94-79 and cruise to the victory. ""Just felt tightness in my left hamstring,"" Harden said. ""We'll see how it feels tomorrow."" Harden missed seven games last season with a Grade 2 hamstring strain and said this was not the same type of injury. ""It's nothing serious. Nothing serious,"" he said. ""It's not close to last year. Just being cautious."" Harden scored 29 points and Carmelo Anthony had a season-high 22 for the Rockets, who were missing two starters. Paul finished up a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with the Lakers last week and James Ennis sat out with a strained right hamstring. Eric Gordon made his second straight start in place of Paul and Michael Carter-Williams made his first start of the season with Ennis on the bench. Coach Mike D'Antoni knows that no one is happy about how the team is playing right now, but he's confident that his group will turn things around soon. ""Bad start, we get it, but I saw some things tonight that we can get better at, work on and it's not that far off,"" he said. ""We'll get CP back on Friday ... (and) we're going to do this and this team is going to be good. This team is going to be really good. We just got to hang in there for a little bit and go through some growing pains."" Utah got this season's series with Houston off on a good note after the Rockets beat the Jazz 4-1 in the Western Conference semifinals after winning all four regular-season meetings. Mitchell had his best game of the young season, with seven assists and five rebounds after failing to score 20 points in Utah's first three games. He said he was ""110 percent"" frustrated after not playing as well as he'd liked in the last three games. ""Not so much from a scoring aspect, just because I wasn't making the plays that I need to make,"" he said. The Jazz had a 15-point lead early in the fourth after scoring the first six points of the quarter. Houston got going after that, scoring the next seven points, with the first four from Clint Capela and a 3 from Anthony to make it 81-75 with about nine minutes left. Mitchell hit a 3-pointer with less than eight minutes to go to leave the Jazz up by nine. Harden re-entered the game soon after that and made a jump shot after a steal by P.J. Tucker. Tucker grabbed another steal on the next possession and dished it to Harden, who found Capela ahead of the defense for a slam dunk that cut the lead to 84-79 and had Jazz coach Quin Snyder calling for a timeout as Harden implored the crowd to get louder. The Jazz led by eight at halftime after holding Houston to just 15 points in the second quarter and had pushed the lead to 16 midway through the third after a 3-pointer by Joe Ingles. Utah was up 75-66 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Jazz: Raul Neto missed his fourth straight game with a hamstring injury. ... Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 13 rebounds. ... Ingles added 11 points. Rockets: Centers Nene (right calf tightness) and Zhou Qi (left knee sprain), and forward Marquese Chriss (left ankle sprain) did not play. ... Anthony hadn't scored more than nine points in any of the first three games. WHAT A TEAMMATE Paul's suspension came because of an altercation he had with Rajon Rondo after Paul said the Lakers guard spit at him. On Tuesday night Rondo did an interview with ESPN where he called Paul a ""horrible teammate."" Harden said he hadn't heard about Rondo's comments when asked after the game but shared his thoughts on playing with the nine-time All-Star. ""I think he's a pretty cool teammate to me,"" Harden said. ""Pretty cool guy to be around. For real.""","401070738"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers nearly made Spurs coach Gregg Popovich ill. Oladipo had 21 points, Indiana had 34 assists and the Pacers led for all but the opening seconds in a 116-96 victory over San Antonio on Wednesday night. Popovich joked before the game that San Antonio's defense might land him in the emergency room. Oladipo and the sharp-shooting Pacers had no trouble finding space to fire away. ""We moved the ball,"" Oladipo said. ""I think when we move the ball, it kind of translates to being in unison and being together on the defensive end as well. When everybody feels good, everybody's touching (the ball), everybody wants to defend."" The Pacers limited the Spurs to 6-for-19 shooting on 3-pointers while leading by as many as 29 points. Defense has been the foundation of San Antonio's five NBA Championships and 21 straight postseason appearances, but they are struggling to maintain that consistency with an overhauled roster. ""We have a lot of work to do on both ends of the court, and we know that, especially defensively,"" Popovich said. ""We're defensively challenged, so to speak. Until we figure it out, there's a lot of habits that have to be formed."" Seven Pacers scored in double figures, including 19 points by Tyreke Evans and 16 by Domantas Sabonis. Oladipo led the team with nine assists, and nine others had at least one. ""When you have that type of ball movement, you're hitting guys and you're making the defense work and you're playing to your third and fourth option,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""A lot of times, you're going to get some open looks, and they can shoot the ball when they're open."" DeMar DeRozan had 18 points to lead the Spurs, his lowest total since joining the team in an offseason trade from Toronto. Marco Belinelli added 16 points and LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes had 15 each. DeRozan said the Spurs are still adapting to one another. ""Communication thing, understanding spots, understanding tendencies, understanding terminology,"" DeRozan said of what the team needs to work on. ""It's kind of a little bit of everything. It's a new group, we still haven't gotten rolling offensively like we want, and defensively as well. So, once we get both them two things clicking, we're going to be all right."" The Pacers dominated with a strong combination of inside muscle and outside shooting. Indiana shot 53 percent on 3-pointers, opening the game 9 for 11 on 3s. Sabonis also had a monstrous dunk against Spurs forward Davis Bertans early in the second quarter, winding up and dunking with his left hand around the reach of a leaping Bertans. The Spurs only lead came when Rudy Gay scored the game's opening points on an 11-foot fadeaway jumper. Gay finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana entered the game second in the NBA by shooting 43 percent on 3-pointers. ... The Pacers held an opponent under 100 points for the second time this season. Spurs: Forbes is the first starting point guard for the Spurs other than Tony Parker to score in double figures in each of his first four games since Maurice Cheeks in 1989. ... The Spurs played their 1,700th game in San Antonio. They are 1,270-429 at home, which is the best home record of any team in league history. EASY CHOICE Popovich had high praise for McMillan, who will be one of his assistants when the Spurs' veteran coach leads Team USA. ""He's a class act from top to bottom,"" Popovich said of McMillan. ""He's knowledgeable, he's really experienced in USA Basketball, he's got great demeanor, he's very, very well respected and ... I think that's enough. I think those are all pretty good reasons why I was hoping he would agree to do it, so, I was thrilled when he decided he would do it."" STILL EARLY Oladipo is not reading too much into the Spurs' early struggles defensively. ""It's a new year,"" Oladipo said. ""It's only the fourth, fifth game of the year. So, you as a media, you've got to kind of analyze all that, but them as players and coaching staff, they've just got to keep getting better and they'll be fine.""","401070739"
"MILWAUKEE --  After a cold start, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks offense again roared to life, including a near-record output in the second quarter. Before celebrating the scoring outburst, coach Mike Budenholzer wanted to talk about his team's second-half defense after a 123-108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. After surrendering 64 first-half points, Milwaukee's defense buckled down in the second half, holding the 76ers to 44 points, including 17 in the third quarter. ""We've got to have our defense there no matter what we are doing on the other end,"" Budenholzer said. ""When you do that, you can keep a lead and maybe build a lead."" Eric Bledsoe said the turnaround stemmed from paying greater attention to the defensive game plan. ""I thought we did a poor job in the first half,"" Bledsoe said. ""We locked in during the second half."" Antetokounmpo had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Bucks, who improved to 4-0 for the first time since the 2001-02 season. Antetokounmpo downplayed his performance. ""I feel like I can be way better and help my teammates find open shots even more and I'm going to keep trying to get better,"" he said. Khris Middleton had 25 points, and Brook Lopez chipped in 21. Joel Embiid scored 30 points for Philadelphia, which was coming off a wild 133-132 overtime loss Tuesday at Detroit. JJ Redick added 19 points for the 76ers, who fell to 2-3. The Bucks overcame early ice-cold shooting before gradually taking control. Lopez misfired on his first four 3-point attempts but then sank five straight to spark a second-quarter rally. ""We all came out and struggled a little bit shooting it, but we have to stick with it,"" Lopez said. Antetokounmpo had a message for Lopez after the early misses. ""Keep shooting. That's what I told him, personally,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I heard everybody tell him to keep shooting. We don't want Embiid staying in the paint all night. He's not going to give us driving lanes. He made some shots and the paint opened up."" Lopez's shooting helped propel the Bucks to 49 second-quarter points, four shy of the team record for a quarter. ""You have to pick your poison and figure out what you can live with,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""You can't have it all. Give him credit, he made those shots. It was hard to overcome that many points in the second period."" The Bucks led by eight during the second quarter and held a 71-64 advantage at the break. Middleton had 20 first-half points, and Redick had 16. Milwaukee stretched the lead to 15 during the third quarter and held a 92-81 advantage heading to the fourth. The Bucks poured it on in the final period, building a 16-point lead midway through. The 76ers pulled within eight late, but a pair of free throws by Antetokounmpo and a driving, one-handed scoop layup by Eric Bledsoe quickly pushed the lead to 12. The 76ers held a 34-22 lead after one quarter by making 6 of 8 from 3-point range, with five players sinking shots from deep. The Bucks made just 1 of 11 3s and shot 23 percent overall, trailing by 14 at one point. The Bucks finished 13 for 43 from long range for the game. FAST PACE The Bucks have pushed the pace on offense under first-year coach Budenholzer, which left Antetokounmpo with his hands on his knees on a few occasions. ""We play fast. I was a little bit out of breath,"" he said. ""I've got to get in shape.""

"PHOENIX --  In his fourth game, LeBron James finally got his first victory as a Los Angeles Laker. James flirted with what would have been his 74th career triple-double, finishing with 19 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds before sitting out the fourth quarter of a 131-113 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. ""It feels great,"" he said. ""It is a win, period, but it feels good to know what we have been doing over training camp and these first few games to continue to get better."" Lance Stephenson had 23 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, JaVale McGee added 20 points and Kyle Kuzma had 17 for the Lakers. They had seven players in double figures. The Suns' Devin Booker had 23 points, seven rebounds and seven assists but left the game in the third quarter with a strained left hamstring.  Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick this year, had 22 points and 11 rebounds. Los Angeles was without Rajon Rondo and Brandon Ingram for their roles in an altercation with the Houston Rockets on Saturday night. Wednesday night was the first of a three-game suspension for Rondo and a four-game suspension for Ingram. But the Lakers didn't miss them in this one, blowing it open with a 44-point second quarter. Neither team led by more than six points in the first quarter and the Suns were down only 46-41 after Isaiah Canaan's driving layup with 7:09 left in the half. But Phoenix committed four turnovers in a 17-2 Los Angeles outburst that put the Lakers up 63-43 on Josh Hart's running dunk with 3:51 left in the first half. ""That is what we keep harping on. That is what we will continue to harp on throughout the season is our defensive approach,"" James said. ""How we approach the game, our physicality, our communication and that is what we did in the second quarter."" Los Angeles outscored the Suns 44-24 in the second quarter. ""Our defense picked up,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""To start the game our defense was soft. They missed some shots but that was the same thing that happened against San Antonio, but they made shots. We need to get better at that. We need to start games with the same mentality that we started the second quarter."" Phoenix committed eight turnovers in the second quarter, resulting in 15 Lakers points. ""In the first quarter we had a defensive presence,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We had a couple good defensive possessions and showed some kind of resistance defensively and we had a close game. But in the rest of the game, starting with the turnovers, we were thinking too much."" The Lakers led 76-54 at the break and Phoenix never got closer than 16 in the third quarter. ""The Lakers are a good team,"" Kokoskov said. ""We were talking about this morning that we're not buying in their record right now. They're much better than the record is saying. But I'm not pleased with any part of game, including defense."" TIP-INS Lakers: James has five fewer triple-doubles than Wilt Chamberlain.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Dave Joerger's young Kings team had another night of silly mistakes, broken plays and missed assignments. This time Sacramento played through the trouble and won. De'Aaron Fox scored 21 points, including a leaning, one-handed dunk as part of a pivotal run late in the fourth quarter, and the Kings beat the Memphis Grizzlies 97-92 on Wednesday. Sacramento won despite 17 turnovers, two coming in the final minute when the Kings failed to advance the ball past midcourt before the eight-second limit and later couldn't get the ball inbounds in time. ""We made a lot, a lot of mistakes, but we just kept coming and coming and coming,"" Joerger said. ""We overcame those mistakes with our effort. They believe that if we play fast we have a chance."" Buddy Hield had 23 points, Willie Cauley-Stein added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Nemanja Bjelica had 11 points and 11 boards for the Kings. Fox scored 10 in the third quarter to help Sacramento erase an eight-point deficit, but made only one basket over the final 17 minutes. It was an impressive one. After Bjelica stole the ball near midcourt, a sprinting Fox took the pass and dunked left-handed over Memphis center Marc Gasol. Fox's jam brought the Golden1 Center crowd to its feet and sparked a 14-4 run that put the Kings up for good. ""I was hoping he'd jump, but that's Marc's game -- he doesn't go up to block shots,"" Fox said. ""I missed a few layups yesterday and today, so it was like, go do something that's a for-sure bucket."" Gasol exited with 5:54 remaining due to an undisclosed injury and walked into the locker room with a large bag of ice around his neck. He finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Mike Conley scored 27 points, and Jaren Jackson had 14 points and seven rebounds for Memphis. Wayne Selden added 13 points. The Grizzlies were coming off consecutive impressive wins over Atlanta and Utah following a season-opening, 28-point loss to Indiana. Memphis led by 14 in the first half but was held to 19 points in the third quarter and 21 in the fourth. ""We didn't come out with the same level of grit in the second half that we did to start the game,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We're still learning how to be on the same page. It's the main thing for us."" Gasol scored five points and Selden and Omri Casspi came off the bench to make 3-pointers as part of a 15-5 run to close out the first quarter. The Grizzlies led by 14 midway through the second before the Kings made a late run of their own to pull to 52-44 at halftime. Sacramento led 95-86 late in the fourth before Memphis took advantage of the Kings' carelessness and made it close. ""Our ability to learn on the fly is impressive for how young we are,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""So yeah, it is going to be chaotic and we're going to make really dumb mistakes, but we push the pace so much we're going to get those possessions back."" BOARDING UP The Kings outrebounded the Grizzlies and had a 15-13 edge on the offensive end. BIG SHOT BUDDY Hield shot 10 of 20 and made a key 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. He also followed Fox's dunk with one of his own. ""The guy's spirit is so pure,"" Joerger said. ""He just keeps competing and all of a sudden, bang, bang, gets two shots to go in and things look a lot different."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Chandler Parsons did not play because of right knee soreness. Kings: Marvin Bagley III had 13 points and six rebounds. The second overall pick in the draft continues to come off the bench for Joerger's squad. ... Iman Shumpert was held out with a sore left hip. Shumpert started the previous two games. ... Justin Jackson started at small forward in place of Shumpert.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry pulled one from Michael Jordan's old celebratory playbook and shrugged like no big deal whatsoever. Nah, not at all. Just another 3-pointer from way downtown. Curry grinned as he kept lighting up the floor, scoring 51 points and finishing with 11 3-pointers in only three quarters of the Golden State Warriors' 144-122 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. ""The last 3 in the first quarter was probably the funniest thing I've experienced on the court. Two guys on our team are yelling at the time from the time I was at the free throw line: `Don't pass it! Don't pass it! You better shoot it!' All that type of stuff,"" Curry said. ""That's going through my head while I'm dribbling down. That's kind of all the motivation you need just to launch it. Thankfully it went in."" Coach Steve Kerr couldn't even be upset when his superstar let it fly from any distance he desired: ""You got a guy taking 40-footers and you're on the sideline going, `Yeah, that's a good shot,"" Kerr said. Kevin Durant added 30 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, and Draymond Green had 11 of his 12 assists in the first half to help two-time defending champions finish with 37 after dishing out 35 assists in a 20-point victory against Phoenix on Monday. But this was all Curry's show. No. 30 knocked down his 11th 3 of the night late in the third from 32 feet back. ""It's just one of those nights you just have so much fun playing the game,"" Curry said. ""Taking some dare shots and trying to sustain that for as long as I'm out there on the floor."" He scored 31 in the first half, finished with his sixth career 50-point game and made 10 or more 3s for the 10th time. The 51 points matched his most at Oracle Arena. Curry hit his first five 3-pointers then after his fifth one drove to the basket and was fouled. He made two free throws to chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" The two-time winner of the award had the ninth 30-point half of his career and fourth at home. ""It was a joy to be on the same court with that. That was sick,"" Durant said. The ""MVP!"" cheers continued. Curry shot 15 for 24, 11 of 16 from 3-point range and made all 10 free throws, missing his career high of 54 set in February 2013 by three points. ""He was, I don't even know how to describe what I witnessed tonight, amazing, video-game stuff,"" Kerr said. ""... Some of the shooting was just mind-boggling. Nobody's ever done what he's doing, pulling up from I don't know, 32."" Curry has scored 30 or more points in four of the first five games and had 29 on Monday against Phoenix, also playing just three quarters. He has hit at least five 3-pointers in each game so far. Bradley Beal bruised his sternum early then returned late in the first half and wound up with 23 points. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 17 points off the bench for Washington. Beal said he took an elbow from Durant. X-rays were negative. ""Breathing was a little messed up and it felt like my rib was out of place,"" Beal said. ""It hurts but I'll be OK.""

Five members of the team attended morning shootaround then Hall of Famer Rick Barry joined the group for the game. Six players and assistant coach Joe Roberts took turns hoisting the trophy during a ceremony before the second quarter. Coach Al Attles wasn't in attendance as originally planned because he wasn't feeling well. Golden State sported gold throwback jerseys for the occasion. THOMPSON'S TOUCH Klay Thompson missed his first three 3-point tries before connecting with 6:36 left in the third and scored 19 points. Thompson is 4 for 27 from long range through the initial five games. ""One thing I love about Klay is he's going to shoot his way out of anything,"" Kerr said.","401070743"
"DETROIT --  Dwane Casey has coached Detroit to its best start in a decade. He's also well aware the Pistons have a long way to go. ""It's good for our team, good for our morale, but we know that there's bigger mountains to climb down the road,"" said Casey, who was hired to coach the Pistons this past offseason. ""We've just got to continue to work and improve and get better in certain areas."" Andre Drummond had 26 points and 22 rebounds, and the Pistons remained unbeaten with a 110-103 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday night. Detroit is 4-0 for the first time since the 2008-09 season. Cleveland, which was without injured star Kevin Love, fell to 0-5 for the first time since 2003-04, when LeBron James was a rookie. Blake Griffin scored 26 points in his first game since a 50-point night against Philadelphia on Tuesday. Reggie Jackson added 16 points for the Pistons. Kyle Korver led Cleveland with 21 points. ""As competitors we want to win, but I thought there was some good out there tonight,"" Korver said. ""I thought we were playing with more energy, we passed the ball earlier in the shot clock, kept things going in motion, scrapped on defense, but it's hard to win in the NBA."" The Pistons scored the first six points of the game before the Cavaliers scored the next 11. Detroit went on a 12-0 run late in the second quarter and led 58-50 at halftime. Drummond  -- who was ejected in the win over the 76ers --  had 20 points and 20 rebounds through three quarters against Cleveland. The Pistons were up 12 heading into the fourth. The Cavaliers cut the margin to six with 49 seconds left in the fourth when Korver made a 3-pointer while being fouled for a four-point play. Detroit was able to close the game out after that. The Pistons have won their four games by a combined 13 points, and they haven't played too tough a schedule. Three of the victories were against the Nets, Bulls and Cavaliers. Detroit's next two games are against the Celtics. ""We can't get too excited,"" Drummond said. ""It's still early in the season, and we have a lot of games to go. So we've got to take them win by win and game by game and just keep getting better."" INJURIES Love missed the game with a sore left foot, and Detroit lost Luke Kennard to a right shoulder injury after a Cleveland player set a screen on him in the second quarter. Casey said Kennard may have a sprain, and the team should know more Friday. IN RESERVE Korver was one of four Cleveland backups who scored in double figures. ""Thought our bench was great all night -- even in the first half, I thought they did a great job,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Then coming back in the second half, I thought Kyle got going, Larry (Nance Jr.) was good. J.R. (Smith) was missing shots, but I liked his competing against Blake, fronting the post, got a couple steals and deflections."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's starting backcourt of George Hill and Rodney Hood had no assists Wednesday against Brooklyn . Those two combined for just one assist against Detroit. Pistons: Jackson reached the 2,000-assist mark early in the first quarter, but he got in foul trouble and played only 6:16 in the first half. ... Detroit had 20 turnovers to Cleveland's nine, which snapped a 72-game streak in which the Pistons had forced at least 10 turnovers in each game.","401070744"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Damian Lillard struggled in the first half then was back in All-Star form after halftime. Lillard scored 34 of his 41 points in the second half, and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Orlando Magic 128-114 on Thursday night. CJ McCollum had 22 for the Trail Blazers and Jusuf Nurkic added 18 points and 10 rebounds. Lillard was just 2 for 8 in the first half, then hit 11 of 15 shots in the final two quarters, going 5 of 8 from 3-point territory. He sat out the first four minutes of the final quarter and watched a 13-point lead shrink to just 102-99. ""It's not really about filling up the stat sheet,"" Lillard said. ""There are opportunities to do it but I think it is more about impacting the game. Even when I am not making shots, I focus on how can I still impact the game."" Lillard and McCollum then re-entered with 7:54 left after Orlando cut a 13-point deficit to just 102-99 on Gordon's second 3-pointer of the quarter. The guards combined to score 22 of Portland's final 26 points to seal the win. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Terrence Ross had 21 points off the bench and Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier had 17 apiece. The Magic shot 50 percent from the field and made 12 3-pointers, but never could find a way to stop Portland. ""If you look at the offensive numbers, you ought to win this game,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""But the biggest thing tonight was our defense. It started with the first five minutes when we made mistake after mistake. We just weren't good."" Lillard had 19 points in the third quarter, including 11 of the Blazers' last 13. Magic guards D.J. Augustin and Jerian Grant chased him around the perimeter and into the lane, but never could catch him. He had three 3-pointers and five driving layups, before taking a break to start the fourth quarter. However, Portland couldn't shake the Magic, who trailed 91-80 going to the fourth period. But after Orlando cut it to three, Lillard and McCollum combined for eight straight points and Portland was back in front 110-99. Backup center Zach Collins had 13 points in nine minutes to help the Blazers to a 58-48 halftime lead. He helped the Blazers overcome a slow start by Lillard (2 for 8) and McCollum (foul trouble). Ross kept the Magic within striking distance with 12 points on 5-for-7 shooting. The Magic kept pace offensively, but were a step slow at the defensive end and Portland beat them to the basket repeatedly. TIP-INS TRAIL BLAZERS: Lillard's 41 points were the most ever scored by a Portland player against Orlando. . Collins hit all five field goal attempts in the first half, including a pair of 3-pointers. MAGIC: Orlando never led in the game after never trailing in the last game, a 93-90 win over Boston. . Vucevic has scored 25 or more points in five of his last seven games against Portland. PACE OF PLAY The NBA season is only a week old, but Portland coach Terry Stotts and Clifford have noticed the same thing. ""Right now the pace of games is off the charts,"" Stotts said. ""Teams are definitely playing faster,"" Clifford added. The scoring average for the NBA is up seven points from last season -- 113.4 so far from 106.3. Neither coach was sure how long it would last. ""It's hard to gauge after four or five games, but guys are pushing the ball up the floor,"" Clifford said. ""I think all of us coaches are interested in seeing what's going to happen 15-20 games in."" Said Stotts: ""It's hard to say it's a trend after one week, but it is a reality right now. I think it's fun. I like offensive basketball, but check back with me in January.""","401070745"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Kyrie Irving was overthinking how to fit in. He missed last season's playoffs after left knee surgery, and because the Boston Celtics reached the Eastern Conference finals without him, he was cautious when he returned this season. Once he relaxed and started having fun, everything flowed. Jayson Tatum scored 24 points, Irving had 15 points and five assists, and the Celtics rallied from a 16-point halftime deficit to beat the winless Oklahoma City Thunder 101-95 on Thursday night. ""When we're not on the same page, we're very, very bad,"" Irving said. ""I think we want to err on the side of being one and being together and playing well together. It's just a lot better basketball that way. And it starts with me, too."" Marcus Morris added 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Al Horford added 19 points for the Celtics.

Russell Westbrook had 13 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, but he shot 5 for 20. Oklahoma City led 50-34 at halftime. Boston shot just 32 percent in the first half and missed all 11 of its 3-point attempts. Boston hit seven of its first 10 3-pointers in the third quarter to trim Oklahoma City's lead to 70-64. At one point, Horford hit three 3-pointers in 41 seconds. ""It felt really good,"" Horford said. ""Before the second quarter ended, Kyrie looked at me and said, `Hey, we've got to set the tone. We have to be more aggressive.' He was right. We started in the third (quarter) and I tried to do my part and just play with more freedom out there.""

"LOS ANGELES --  When Kobe Bryant took a courtside seat in the first quarter, Staples Center buzzed with excitement for the mere sight of the most popular athlete in this building's history. The crowd even started a ""Kobe! Kobe!"" chant in the fourth quarter -- and it was immediately drowned out by cheers when LeBron James hit a 3-pointer. With the symbol of the Los Angeles Lakers' past watching in approval, James and the Lakers' young core proved that their present and future is pretty tantalizing, too. James had 28 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds while leading a late rally for his first home victory with the Lakers, 128-111 over the previously unbeaten Denver Nuggets on Thursday night. LeBron and Kobe didn't get a chance to talk, but the longtime friendly rivals likely both left happy with the Lakers' new direction after James' first triple-double for LA. ""Of course I noticed him sitting right on the baseline over there,"" James said. ""One of the all-time Laker greats. What he's done for this franchise in his 20-plus years here speaks wonders for me. To be able to compete against him all those years, and for me to be able to share a jersey, the same jersey as him at this point, is pretty special."" With Bryant in attendance for the first time since LeBron's arrival in LA, Kyle Kuzma scored 22 points and JaVale McGee added 21 to complement James' 74th career triple-double. But the result was even more impressive: The Lakers trailed by eight points with six minutes left in the fourth quarter before Lance Stephenson, who finished with 12 points, started a 15-2 rally with back-to-back 3-pointers. ""The first couple of games, when we fell behind, we stayed behind,"" James said. ""Tonight when we fell behind, we learned from our mistakes, and that's one of the most important things in life."" James got Staples Center rocking on a go-ahead dunk with 3:31 to play before Lonzo Ball made an artful step-back 3-pointer. Kuzma added two huge dunks down the stretch of Los Angeles' second win in two days after an 0-3 start. ""LeBron is doing what he always does,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""And LeBron is bringing all those guys their confidence way up. You're seeing Kyle Kuzma and LeBron, their chemistry growing."" Nikola Jokic scored 24 points for the Nuggets, who were off to their best start since the 2009-10 season. Jamal Murray scored 22 points and Monte Morris had 20, but Denver couldn't answer the Lakers' rally led by James, who posted his third career triple-double in Staples Center for his third different team. ""We just came out on the short end today, but we've got a couple of days off to revamp ourselves,"" said Morris, who added seven assists in just his eighth NBA game. One night after earning their first win of the LeBron era in Phoenix, the Lakers beat the Nuggets at Staples for the fourth straight time.

The compact guard finished last season with the Lakers, averaging 15.6 points in 17 games after getting traded by James' Cavaliers. ... Will Barton missed his third straight game with a hip injury. Lakers: Rookie Svi Mykhailiuk had four points. The Ukrainian guard scored his first NBA points one night earlier in Phoenix. ... Fans near courtside besides Bryant included actor Michael B.

KOBE'S HOUSE Bryant sat with Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, his former agent, in a rare visit since the 20-year Lakers veteran retired in 2016. Bryant spoke to a group of season ticket holders before the game about his forthcoming book. ""That's one of my favorite players,"" a visibly excited Stephenson said afterward. ""He was like, `Good game,' after the game, so I was a little hyped."" LANCE BOILS Stephenson provided an enormous boost for the Lakers on both ends of the court, in his usual inimitable style. The veteran said he came off the bench with a specific plan in mind: ""Aggressive defense, and attack the big man (Jokic). We felt like their big man couldn't match our intensity, so when I got in there, I was like, `Man, I'm going to attack the big man.""","401070747"
"The Hornets were feeling it to close the half, going on in 18-4 run vs. the Bulls en route to a 45-point second quarter. (0:22) CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Hornets coach James Borrego told Kemba Walker he wants him to lead the NBA in 3-point attempts. When asked his reaction, Walker broke into the widest smile he could muster, saying ""that's what I want to hear."" Walker had 30 points on five more 3-pointers, and Charlotte beat the Chicago Bulls 135-106 on Friday night for their first home victory of the season. Through six games, the two-time All-Star in second in the league in 3-point attempts (64) and 3-pointers made (29) behind only Golden State's Stephen Curry, who is setting the pace at 39 of 74 from beyond the arc. Walker finished fourth in the league last season with 241 3-pointers. Curry was ninth, but largely because he missed 31 games due to injuries. ""We trust his three,"" Borrego said. ""The way he's shooting it, the confidence, the spacing around him, the movement around him, we expect those 3s to keep him in (Curry's) area. And if we can get more, I want more. It's my job to help him find more 3s and to create more 3s. We don't want this to decline. If anything, we want this to increase."" Walker, who came in averaging 31 points, bounced back from a season-low 23-point outing against the Bulls, shooting 11 of 18 from the field. He also had seven assists and six rebounds. ""It just feels good when I'm shooting,"" said Walker, who is shooting 3s at a career-best 45 percent clip. ""I want to keep it up. I want to get them up. That's just the way the game is now. For us to win we have to get some threes up and make them at a high-percentage and I want to be the one to lead that."" Zach LaVine had 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting for the Bulls. TIP INS Bulls: Kris Dunn (knee), Lauri Markkanen (elbow), Denzel Valentine (ankle) and Bobby Portis missed the game with injuries. ""I know we are throwing a lot of makeshift lines out there, but it is not an excuse to not go out there and play hard,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg.  ... Were outrebounded 50-34.

He accomplished the feat Saturday night at Miami during a four-game trip. ... Shot 57 percent from the field. ... Four of next five games are at home. PARKER STEPS UP Tony Parker, in his first season with the Hornets, is excelling off the bench. He added 18 points and eight assists as Charlotte avenged a two-point loss in Chicago on Wednesday night. Hoiberg felt Parker was the one who turned the game around in Charlotte's 45-point second quarter. ""He had a couple of answer backs, got to the middle of the floor, got to his right hand and went through our gaps early in the possession and he got right to the rim on us,"" Hoiberg said. ""That took the lid off, they got confident and then they got going."" BRIDGING THE GAP The Hornets are getting solid play out of rookie forward Miles Bridges, who had 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting to go along with five rebounds and two steals. ""I'm getting more confidence with Miles Bridges every single night and every single day,"" Borrego said. ""He's doing his job at a high level.  He wants to get better.  He cares about getting better.  He's coachable. He plays hard and I need him to get better every single night."" SLOW START, FAST FINISH After missing their first 11 3-pointers of the game, the Hornets went on a tear, making the final 14 of 22 shots from beyond the arc. ""We just brought a lot more energy,"" Bridges said. ""We wanted to focus more on the defensive end, we just put an emphasis on defense and that's what really got us there.""","401070748"
"NEW YORK --  If this is what Kevin Durant can do at Madison Square Garden, no wonder Knicks fans are so desperate for him to come to New York. This kind of show was worth seeing more than once a season. Durant scored 25 of his 41 points in Golden State's ruthless fourth-quarter clinic, and the Warriors beat the Knicks 128-100 on Friday night. Durant was the center of attention leading into the game and then the star of it in front of fans who hope he will consider the Knicks if he becomes a free agent this summer. He's not interested in the off-the-court stuff right now, but he loved what happened on the floor in his 10-for-13 final quarter. ""It feels like when you catch every green light when you're going somewhere,"" Durant said. New York led by three after three quarters before Durant and the Warriors starting hitting from all over the floor, making 19 of 26 shots -- and things went so well that on a rare long-range miss by Durant, the ball bounced all the way out behind the arc to a wide-open Stephen Curry, who made the 3-pointer. Asked what changed in the fourth quarter, when Golden State outscored New York 47-16, Knicks coach David Fizdale said: ""Kevin Durant."" Curry added 29 points and six 3-pointers, giving him at least five in every game this season. But on the floor where he scored a career-best 54 points in 2013, his performance seemed almost quiet because of Durant. He finished 17 of 24 from the floor, including 5 of 9 from behind the arc -- where one of the misses was a one-legged attempt. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 24 points for the Knicks, who have dropped five in a row after a season-opening victory over Atlanta. Fizdale changed up his starting lineup, going with Hardaway, Frank Ntilikina, Noah Vonleh, Damyean Dotson and rookie Mitchell Robinson, and the group provided a 16-10 lead. But it was quickly wiped out mostly by Curry, who made his first five shots, with three of them behind the arc. Durant drew plenty of notice upon his arrival and a loud ovation when he was announced with the starting lineups. He can become a free agent after this season and Knicks fans hope he can speed up their rebuilding. A billboard urging him to come to New York popped up on a building near Madison Square Garden this week. Curry said it's not a distraction, saying the Warriors have faced greater concerns during their run of three championships in the last four years. ""The way he's handled it, obviously letting his play speak for itself and not getting too wrapped up or involved in it, understanding we've got seven more months of this,"" Curry said. ""So we know how to keep distractions out of our locker room and just play basketball and enjoy what we do."" TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State visits the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. It's the first time the Warriors have played the two New York teams on the same trip. ... Draymond Green scored 18 points. Knicks: New York has lost the last nine meetings. ... Ntilikina scored 17 points and Trey Burke, the former starting point guard, had 15. BYE, BOOGIE DeMarcus Cousins isn't even playing for Golden State yet and he's been ejected from a game. The volatile center was sitting in street clothes for arguing with referee Scott Foster in the first quarter. As play resumed following a timeout with 2:28 remaining in the first quarter, it was announced that Cousins had been assessed a technical foul during the break, and then subsequently ejected. Cousins is still recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon. He took part in his first practice with the Warriors on Thursday, but there is still no timetable for his return to action. FEAR FACTOR Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who has been outspoken about President Donald Trump and gun violence, was asked if was concerned for his own safety in the wake of the mail bombs sent to prominent Democrats. ""A little bit, yeah,"" Kerr said. ""I think we should all be concerned. No matter who you are you need to be concerned, not just of the bombs, but just somebody shooting you,"" adding it was a ""dangerous time to be alive right now"" in the U.S. Kerr's father, Malcolm Kerr, a professor who served as president of the American University of Beirut, was shot and killed outside his office in the war-torn Lebanese capital in 1984.","401070749"
"TORONTO --  With a strong start and a big finish, Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors added to their perfect start. Lowry had 20 points and 12 assists, Kawhi Leonard scored 21 points and Toronto set a franchise record with its sixth straight win to start the season, beating the Dallas Mavericks 116-107 on Friday night. Jonas Valanciunas scored 17 points, Danny Green had 15 and Serge Ibaka finished with 11 as the Raptors eclipsed the 5-0 start they recorded in 2015-16. DeAndre Jordan had 18 points and 15 rebounds for the Mavericks, who trailed by 17 points in the first quarter. Luka Doncic scored 22 points, and Wesley Matthews had 21. Jordan struggled to find a family friendly way to describe Dallas' poor showing in the first. ""Our defense to start the game has been ... what's a G-rated word? Terrible,"" he said. Dallas clawed back and trailed by three heading into the fourth, but Toronto opened the quarter with a 9-2 run. Dallas shot 7 for 24 in the fourth. ""We just didn't compete at the same level they did down the stretch,"" Mavs forward Harrison Barnes said. ""That's what the big difference was."" Lowry, who didn't turn the ball over, recorded 10 or more assists for a career-best fourth straight game. He's the first Raptors player to accomplish the feat since Jose Calderon had five in a row in March 2012. ""He's really good,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""Each year that goes by, he starts being able to pick out things and see it more clearly."" Nurse replaced Dwane Casey last summer. He is staying focused during Toronto's solid start. ""I'm not getting too far down the road,"" Nurse said. Dallas, which let a 26-point lead slip away in Wednesday's loss at Atlanta, dropped its second straight after winning two in a row. ""We did a lot of good things tonight but we obviously have some things to clean up,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. Green scored 12 points in the first as the Raptors raced out to an 18-2 lead. Toronto led 39-26 after its highest-scoring quarter of the season so far. Matthews scored nine points in the second and Doncic had eight as Dallas cut the deficit to five late in the quarter. Leonard scored nine points for the Raptors and Lowry had eight to help Toronto to a 69-60 lead at halftime. BARNES BACK Barnes made his season debut after missing the first four games because of a strained right hamstring. He shot 5 for 17 and scored 14 points. ""He gives us a dimension that we desperately need so it's great to have him back out there,"" Carlisle said. ALL IN THE FAMILY Jordan arrived for the game dressed in a replica of the No. 58 jersey his brother Avery Jordan wears as an offensive lineman for the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the Canadian Football League. Hamilton is about 40 miles west of Toronto. Jordan said he watches his brother's games on television but has been unable to attend one in person. TIP-INS Mavericks: Jordan led Dallas with five assists. ... Dallas missed nine of its first 10 field-goal attempts, and then made eight of the next 12. ... Mavs rookie Jalen Brunson is the son of former Raptors guard and nine-year NBA veteran Rick Brunson. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (sprained left big toe) missed his second straight game. ... G Delon Wright (left thigh) sat for the fifth time in six games. ... F OG Anunoby (personal reason) was inactive. ... Toronto has allowed at least 100 points in all six games this season. ...

"HOUSTON --  Five games into the season is too early for the Houston Rockets to panic about their bad start. So they are keeping their cool -- for now. ""All in all, we've got to get better in all aspects of it,"" Chris Paul said. ""We've just got to figure it out. Luckily, it's early."" Montrezl Harrell scored a career-high 30 points off the bench to help the Los Angeles Clippers rout short-handed Houston 133-113 on Friday night. It was the Clippers' second win this season over the Rockets, who played without James Harden due to a hamstring injury and dropped to 1-4. Harrell, who was drafted by the Rockets in 2015, was one of six Clippers who scored in double figures. ""He was good last year and what we found in the second half (of last year) what no one knew was that he could score, because he hadn't done it yet in the NBA,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""That's why practices are so important and every day in practice he's scoring, and we start thinking maybe this guy can score, and he's proven that he can."" Lou Williams, another former Rocket, had 23 points for Los Angeles off the bench, and Danilo Gallinari scored 16. Los Angeles scored the first 11 points of the fourth quarter to make it 107-83 and put the game out of reach. Rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the 11th overall pick in the draft, had seven points in that stretch for the Clippers. Carmelo Anthony scored a season-high 24 points in his first start for the Rockets, who were also without starter James Ennis. Anthony, who is in his first season in Houston after one difficult year in Oklahoma City, doesn't know why the Rockets have struggled with consistency this season. ""I can't really pinpoint it at this point right now,"" he said. ""We're still all trying to just figure it out. I know we keep saying that it's early but there's some things we have to figure out quickly just to try to get this thing rolling."" Paul had 12 points and eight assists against his former team in his return after serving a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with Lakers guard Rajon Rondo. But his presence wasn't enough to make up for the absence of Harden, who will miss at least one more game after straining his left hamstring in a loss to Utah on Wednesday night. Houston didn't score in the fourth quarter until Anthony made the second of two free throws with 8:41 left. The Rockets opened the second half with an 11-3 run capped by a 3-pointer from P.J. Tucker, trimming the Clippers' lead to 73-72 with about eight minutes left in the third. But Los Angeles ripped off the next eight points, including 3-pointers by Tobias Harris and Avery Bradley, while Houston missed its next eight shots. Isaiah Hartenstein ended a three-minute Houston scoring drought on a dunk with about five minutes left, starting a 6-0 spurt that got the Rockets within three. TIP-INS Clippers: Harris got a technical in the second quarter for jawing at Anthony. ... The Clippers made 35 of 38 free-throw attempts. ... Bradley had 14 points. Rockets: Coach Mike D'Antoni received a technical in the first quarter for yelling at the officials after Harrell knocked Carter-Williams to the ground on a foul. ... C Nene is out for the foreseeable future because of a strained right calf. The center hasn't played this season because of the injury and general manager Daryl Morey said Thursday that he'll be out for at least two more weeks before being re-evaluated. ... Ennis will be re-evaluated after Houston's next game to see if he's healthy enough to play on the team's upcoming road trip. THEY SAID IT Tucker when asked about this team's defense compared to last season's team: ""It's a different team. It's not the same team. I hate talking about last year anymore because it's gone. It's not the same team so we have to figure it out."" NOT SO SWEET HOME The Rockets have had a difficult time at home this season, losing all three games by double digits after only losing three games at home by more than 10 points all last season. It's only the 14th time in NBA history that a team has dropped its first three games at home by double digits, according to STATS.","401070751"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  First-year coach Mike Budenholzer brought his heavy reliance on 3-pointers to the Milwaukee Bucks this season, transforming a team not known for its prowess from beyond the arc. The approach has taken hold and Milwaukee has tied the best start in franchise history. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 15 points and 12 rebounds in just 23 minutes, Ersan Ilyasova added 16 points off the bench and the Bucks beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-95 on Friday night. Khris Middleton scored 16 points and hit four 3-pointers for Milwaukee, which is 5-0 for the second time in franchise history. The 1971-72 Bucks led by Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson started 7-0. Five players scored in double figures for Milwaukee, which made a season-high 19 3-pointers. ""It's been a complete turnaround,"" Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon said. ""Big part, credit to Bud. Not only do we have a great system that we play to advantage every night, our strengths, but he takes care of our bodies. We don't feel run down. We feel healthy, everybody's able to play."" Milwaukee entered the game with the ninth-best offensive rating in the NBA to go with the fourth-best defensive rating. The Bucks also entered shooting 40.8 3-pointers per game, up from last season's total of 24.7 per game. They had connected on 15.3 3s per game this season, the third-highest total in the league. Milwaukee hit just 8.8 per game last season. ""Tonight's exactly how we want to play,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think we did a great job moving the ball, playing hard. And especially, I think they scored like 16 points in the first quarter? We were playing hard defensively, and we were moving the ball offensively."" Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 16 points for a listless Minnesota squad dealing with the distraction of star Jimmy Butler's trade request. Butler started despite being questionable with an illness and had a season-low four points on 2-of-11 shooting. ""I think I was a lot like everybody else,"" Butler said, downplaying the illness. ""We let our offense dictate what our defense was going to bring. Me, speaking for myself, I can never let that happen. My entire career has been my defense dictates my offense. Bad one; it's behind me right now this second. Hopefully, it is for everybody else."" The specter of the trade request has lingered around the Wolves, but Butler had turned boos to cheers in leading Minnesota to wins in the first two home games. The boos were back on Friday as Milwaukee buried Minnesota from the 3-point line. The Wolves started 0 for 11 from the field and were scoreless until Butler scored with 7:19 left in the first quarter. Minnesota missed its first nine 3s and went 10 of 43 for the game. ""It was a combination of us missing our shots, and went down the other end and played low-energy defense,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You're required to do more than one thing and I thought our communication wasn't very good."" The Bucks were also cold early, going just 1 of 8 from 3-point range. But Milwaukee finished the half hitting nine of its next 15 3s to build a 25-point halftime lead. Antetokounmpo scored only five points in the first half but Middleton and Brodgon each had 13. ""It's coaching,"" Brogdon said. ""He treats Giannis the same way he treats the last guy on the bench. We have immense respect for him, everybody's bought into the system and we enjoy playing for him."" TIP-INS Bucks: G Matthew Dellavedova returned after missing one game with an illness. ... Antetokounmpo had his fifth double-double of the season but his lowest scoring output to this point. He added six assists. ... Milwaukee shot 46 3s, which tied a season high. Timberwolves: F Andrew Wiggins missed his second straight game with a bruised right quadriceps. ... With rookie Josh Okogie starting for Wiggins, it was the fourth different starting lineup for Minnesota this season. The Wolves used six different starting combinations last season, the fewest of any team in the league. ... Minnesota got 56 points from its bench, led by Derrick Rose with 14. ... New Minnesota Twins manager Rocco Baldelli threw out T-shirts to the crowd. PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL Former President Barack Obama was in Wisconsin on Friday and told a crowd in attendance at a rally that Antetokounmpo is ""balling."" Word got back to the Bucks before the game. ""It's amazing, a guy like Barack Obama mentioning my name and know what I'm doing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's a great thing."" NO DRAMA, JUST BUSINESS Butler downplayed any part of the off-court rumors affecting the team right now and said there is no drama. ""I don't consider anything drama,"" Butler said. ""I consider it business. It's part of it. I think everybody still wants to win, man. We had an off night. But if we win, everything's OK, everything's fine. You wouldn't be asking me the same question.""","401070752"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis demonstrated what a decisive, composed and efficient tandem they can be when an opponent suffers a last-minute lapse. Holiday highlighted a 26-point performance with a pull-up jumper near the foul line with 2 seconds left, Davis stole Brooklyn's last-gasp inbound pass, and the New Orleans Pelicans remained unbeaten by scoring nine straight over the last 1:49 in a 117-115 victory over the Nets on Friday night. ""Our chemistry is there,"" Holiday said, alluding to New Orleans' 4-0 start to the regular season. ""The way we're playing, I think we know after these last couple games that we can win in tough situations."" The Nets were clinging to a one-point lead and trying to run down the clock when D'Angelo Russell's pass intended for Caris LeVert sailed out of bounds with 7 seconds left. The crowd, which had been screaming nervously for New Orleans to stop the clock by fouling in the moments before the turnover, suddenly erupted into triumphant roars as the Pelicans -- who were out of timeouts -- quickly inbounded the ball and Holiday raced toward the key on the dribble for his go-ahead 17-footer. ""We know what that play is. It's either get the ball to Anthony or come off a screen and if you have a wide-open shot then it's a wide-open shot,"" Holiday said. ""Anthony attracts so many people when he rolls to the basket."" The Nets took a timeout, and that's when Brooklyn's Ed Davis was assessed a technical foul for shoving Solomon Hill away from the Nets' bench area, giving the Pelicans another free throw, which Holiday sank. ""I just learned from Jared Dudley,"" Hill said, referring to Brooklyn's veteran forward. ""I tried to look at their play and a guy put himself in a situation that he probably shouldn't have put himself in and things happen."" The Nets still had a chance until Anthony Davis leapt to tip Joe Harris' inbound pass to himself as time ran out. ""I was just trying to be all over the ball and try to make it tough for them,"" said Davis, who missed 13 of his 19 shots in an off night by his standards, but still finished with 18 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks. ""We just fought the entire game. It wasn't pretty."" Russell's late turnover marred a 24-point performance in which he hit six 3-pointers. ""It was all my fault,"" Russell said. ""We've got to be better, honestly. We focused 47 minutes and 36 seconds, and that other 20-some-odd seconds we wasn't focused. I wasn't focused. So that's where that mistake happened."" The Nets combined for 19 3s in all on 40 attempts, but they could have used one more when LeVert let it fly from deep with about 25 seconds left. It missed, Davis got the rebound, and Dudley purposely fouled Holiday with 21 seconds left and Brooklyn leading by three. Holiday made both free throws to pull the Pelicans to 115-114 and set up the dramatic finish. ""It's a shame because we played a heck of a game, and we didn't close it out when we had opportunities,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We had a lot of young mistakes out there, but we've just got to learn from it."" TIP-INS Nets: LeVert scored 21 points and Shabazz Napier added 16 points. ... The Nets had 26 assists. They have 20-plus assists in each of their five games so far. Pelicans: Elfrid Payton scored 17 points but left in the final minutes with a left leg cramp. ... Davis' fourth block of the game gave him 1,000 for his career. ... Veteran Wesley Johnson saw his first action of the season in the second quarter, when Darius Miller went to the locker room with a bruised quadriceps. QUOTABLE Holiday was nearby when Hill was shoved away from the Nets' bench area and complimented Brooklyn's use of technology to diagram plays. ""I saw they had an iPad and I'm like, `Dang, that's pretty cool,"" Holiday said, noting Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry ""is still using the board to write on."" FROM DOWNTOWN Seven Nets players hit 3s and five made more than one. Dudley, Napier and Spencer Dinwiddie each hit three. But LeVert struggled from long range, missing five of six. Brooklyn is 61 of 141 (43.3 percent) from 3-point range in its past four games. EARLY SURGE The Nets made 10 of 19 3-point attempts in the first half, when Russell made his first four. Brooklyn led by as many as 13, at 66-53, on LeVert's driving layup as he was fouled late in the second quarter.","401070753"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> De'Aaron Fox had to plea repeatedly with Kings teammate Nemanja Bjelica to shoot the ball after Bjelica missed his only two attempts in the first quarter. Once Bjelica got the message, Sacramento's offense started to click. Bjelica made three of his career high-tying six 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and had a key block on John Wall late, and the Kings beat the Washington Wizards 116-112 on Friday night. ""He just opens up everything,"" Fox said. ""European guys, they always want to make the right play so sometimes he doesn't shoot it. I told him, 'Shoot the ball. That's why we brought (you) here.' That's what he started doing."" Bjelica finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds. Buddy Hield scored 22 points and made three free throws over the final 20 seconds for the Kings. ""We got after them and we got our hands on a lot of basketballs,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We need that. That helps us play faster."" Bjelica was scoreless in the first quarter but got going in the second when he scored seven consecutive points. After making back-to-back 3s as part of an 11-0 run in the third, Bjelica made three more shots beyond the arc in the fourth, added a key assist to Hield with 2:45 remaining and then blocked Wall's shot moments later. ""Everything is about opportunity in this league,"" Bjelica said. ""I know that I can play like this but sometimes it's hard because we are such a talented team and there are great players in this league. I'm not just a shooter."" Willie Cauley-Stein also had a double-double with 17 points and 11 boards for the Kings. Fox added 17 points and nine assists. The Wizards, who led by six going into the fourth quarter, committed three turnovers in the final 24 seconds. Sacramento led 110-104 with two minutes left before Washington made a late run and pulled to 113-112 on Wall's 3-pointer with 3.2 seconds remaining. After Fox made one of two free throws, Jeff Green attempted a long inbounds pass but the ball sailed out of bounds. Bjelica then made two free throws to seal the win and end the Kings' four-game losing streak to the Wizards. ""A lot of mistakes on the defensive end, mainly in transition,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""Sometimes we let our offense dictate how we play on the defensive end. If you're not making shots you still have to defend."" Things got chippy at times between the teams during an often sloppy game. Washington had a season-high 21 turnovers while Sacramento committed 19. Wall scored 26 points with eight assists. Kelly Oubre had 22 points and nine rebounds, and Bradley Beal scored 21. Beal skipped the pregame shootaround after sustaining a chest injury in Washington's 144-122 loss at Golden State on Wednesday and struggled with his shot early. The Wizards' leading scorer, Beal missed 10 of his first 12 shots, including a long jumper at the halftime buzzer. Beal also appeared to get cut behind his ear midway through the second quarter when he crashed to the floor under the hoop and hit the back of his head on a camera. ""We're not guarding (anybody) and that's what it comes down to,"" Beal said. ""We've given up like 100 points in every game so far this year and that's terrible.""

"DETROIT --  With Jaylen Brown struggling offensive so far this season, Brad Stevens still asked him if he wanted a shot at defending one of the NBA's hottest players. Not only did Brown slow down the much bigger Blake Griffin, his offense also perked up in the process. Brown scored 19 points and Marcus Morris added 18 for the Boston Celtics in a 109-89 victory on Saturday night over the Detroit Pistons, who lost their first game of the season. Brown came in averaging 8.6 points per game this season, down from 14.5 last year. ""I wasn't tripping,"" Brown said. ""And I've guarded bigs before, especially my rookie year. Actually when Blake was (with the Los Angeles Clippers), I guarded him a little bit. So I was familiar when Brad asked me."" Andre Drummond had 18 points and eight rebounds, and Stanley Johnson scored a season-high 16 for Detroit, which had won its first four games of the season for the first time since 2008-09.? Griffin came in averaging 33.8 points per game, shooting 55.7 percent from the field and 65.2 percent from 3. He missed his first seven shots, including four from 3-point range. ""I just missed open shots early,"" Griffin said. ""I thought that I tried to attack at times and get to the foul line but it didn't go that way."" He scored seven points in 30 minutes, finished 2 of 13 from the field and 0-4 from deep. ""Blake's a handful,"" Stevens said. ""We knew we were mostly going to have to play small on (Griffin) or Drummond, so we just tried to be very active around those guys."" Detroit came in shooting 37.6 percent from 3-point range this season, and went 7 for 37 (18.9 percent). Boston shot 14 for 34 (41.2 percent) from deep. ""It is disappointing,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""One game doesn't make a season. It should get our attention and show us how well we have to play each and every night."" The Celtics opened up a 103-74 lead with 5:15 left to play, cruising in the first of consecutive games. Casey was assessed his first technical foul with Detroit, protesting a first-quarter no-call after Griffin hit the ground. The subsequent Morris free throw capped an 8-0 run that made it 23-11 Boston in the first quarter. The Boston bench outscored Detroit's 34-9 in the first half, as the Celtics opened up a pair of 26-point leads in the second quarter. The Pistons previous largest deficit of the season was 12 points in the opener against Brooklyn. Daniel Theis, who Stevens said was questionable to play with a foot injury, scored 14 points and had seven rebounds before halftime. He finished with 17 points and eight rebounds. Gordon Hayward scored season-high 15 points and Terry Rozier added 14 points off the bench for Boston. TIP-INS Celtics: Aron Baynes, who played two seasons in Detroit, missed his third straight game with a right hamstring strain. .

"NEW ORLEANS --  When Ricky Rubio learned he wouldn't have to worry about Anthony Davis guarding the paint for the Pelicans, the Jazz point guard figured he better look for Utah big-man Rudy Gobert at the rim whenever possible. ""I was looking more to that than anything else,"" Rubio said, adding that when New Orleans' defense collapsed on Gobert, he was able to take advantage of that as well. Rubio had 28 points and 12 assists, Gobert had 25 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks, and Utah became the first team this season to beat New Orleans, 132-111 on Saturday night. ""When Ricky plays like that, it's hard to lose,"" said Gobert, who had a handful of dunks set up by Rubio, several on alley-oop lobs. ""We've got a lot of guys that can score and when Ricky starts to make the right play and puts even more pressure on the defense, it's hard to guard for sure."" Davis was ruled out shortly before the game because of his sprained right elbow -- an injury through which he'd played in a victory a night earlier over Brooklyn. ""There's not any long-term concern,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""He came in today and tried to shoot at shoot-around, and there was a still a little bit of pain. ... I'm not going to risk anything over one game. The Davis-Gobert matchup has been a competitive and compelling one in recent seasons. With Davis out, Gobert had his best offensive game of the young season. He'd come in averaging 14.5 points and had not scored more than 19 points in a game this season. Jazz coach Quin Snyder was quick to highlight the effect of Davis sitting out, noting the Pelicans' five-time All-Star is ""obviously one of the best players in the league, maybe playing the best of anyone in the league right now."" ""We did a good job of trying to attack them in a way that was effective, given his absence,"" Snyder added. Rubio was averaging just 6 points coming in and hadn't scored more than 13 in a game. ""I've got to be more regular. Sometimes I'm not as aggressive as I was tonight,"" Rubio said. ""I felt my shot and kept shooting and we had a good night."" It was perhaps fitting that a Frenchman and Spaniard would dominate in New Orleans -- a city founded by the French and ruled by the Spanish during the early part of its 300-year history, and where Jazz music, as well as the NBA franchise named for it, were born. Rubio has been brilliant in the Big Easy before. He scored 30 in a triumphant trip to New Orleans last March. ""I love playing here,"" Rubio said. Donovan Mitchell scored 22 for Utah. Nikola Mirotic scored 25 points, but 15 of that came in the first quarter, when he hit three 3s and helped the Pelicans take a 31-28 lead into the second period. Jrue Holiday scored 18 points. ""Ricky and Gobert really got the whole lob situation going,"" Holiday said. ""Next time, I think we've got to do a better job at containing them.""

LaVine had 27 points and a career-high 11 rebounds, and the Bulls went 7 of 10 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter to pull away for a 97-85 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. One night earlier, the Bulls were embarrassed 135-106 at Charlotte. ""It's good to get a win,"" said LaVine, who has led the Bulls in scoring in all six games. ""I was upset with the effort that we gave (Friday)."" Jabari Parker scored half of his 18 points in the fourth quarter for the Bulls, who struggled from long range for the first three quarters, making 5 of 23 from beyond the arc. Rookie Wendell Carter Jr. had 10 points and 10 rebounds while playing his first NBA game in his hometown. Trae Young, who entered leading rookies with 21.5 points per game, scored 13 points on 3-of-12 shooting for the Hawks and turned the ball over five times. Taurean Prince led Atlanta with 16 points and reserve Dewayne Dedmon had 13 points and 13 rebounds. Prince, Young and Kent Bazemore combined for 15 of Atlanta's 22 turnovers on a night when the Hawks shot 32.1 percent (27 of 84). ""Coming off two games where we played well (and won), it was a lesson in how you handle success,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Sometimes, we were trying to do too much, and it was evident with our 22 turnovers. ... I thought right from the start we were trying to hit home runs."" Both teams were cold in the first half. The Hawks led 44-41 at the break while shooting 26.2 percent from the field (11 of 42), including a 3-for-15 performance in the paint. Atlanta did make 8 of 22 3-point attempts in the first half to hold the Bulls at bay as Chicago made 15 of 45 overall and 4 of 17 from beyond the arc. The Bulls led 67-63 after three quarters. Atlanta got within two on Vince Carter's 3-pointer midway through the fourth, but the Bulls responded with a 9-2 run, including two 3-pointers by Justin Holiday. ""They didn't like how last night went,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I saw it in their eyes."" The Bulls out-rebounded the Hawks 14-6 in the fourth quarter on the way to their fourth straight win over Atlanta. ""They were fighting,"" Pierce said. ""They lost pretty bad (Friday) night, so they came out with a greater sense of urgency than we did."" TIP-INS Ryan Arcidiacono had 13 points for Chicago and Holiday had 12. ... Forward Bobby Portis, Chicago's leading rebounder, missed his second straight game with a sprained right knee. ... The Hawks asked for a moment of silence before the game for the victims of Saturday's shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a gunman killed 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in U.S. history. HOMECOMING OF SORTS Pierce won't be sentimental about returning to Philadelphia, where he was an assistant before taking the Atlanta job, to face the 76ers on Monday night. ""You look forward to going back to a place you spent a lot of time with the staff, the players, but it's about us. This really is a business trip. It's about us trying to correct what we did tonight,"" he said. ""It will be a tough atmosphere, having been there."" NOT RUNNING WITH THE BULLS The Hawks want to outrun opponents and score easy points, but they were beaten 16-11 in fast-break points, scoring on just 3 of 9 tries.","401070757"
"CLEVELAND --  Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers didn't have to worry about LeBron James on this trip to Cleveland. Oladipo scored 24 points, Bojan Bogdanovic led the way with 25 points and Indiana kept the Cavaliers winless on the season with a 119-107 victory on Saturday night. The teams met for the first time since Cleveland defeated Indiana in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last season. James scored 45 points in Game 7 and the Cavaliers survived their toughest test in reaching the NBA Finals for the fourth straight season. Oladipo hasn't forgotten anything about that game. ""Every time I play here, I sit here in this same locker,"" he said. ""Every time I land in Cleveland, I think about it. I watched it all summer, probably about 75 times. It's all I thought about."" The Pacers had no such troubles this time. Indiana took control midway through the fourth quarter and followed up its 20-point win in San Antonio on Wednesday with another road victory. Cleveland (0-6) is off to its worst start since losing its first seven games in the 1995-96 season. The Cavaliers are struggling to adjust without James, who signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency. Cleveland also missed forward Kevin Love, who was out for the second straight game because of a sore left foot. Cleveland committed 18 turnovers that led to 30 points and helped Indiana shoot 65 percent (48 for 74) from the field. ""Our margin for error is slim,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""It's very slim."" Cleveland cut a 15-point lead to 97-91 early in the fourth quarter before Indiana regained control with four straight baskets. Darren Collison scored on a layup and a jumper, Oladipo hit a 12-footer and Domanta Sabonis scored in the lane. Sabonis made another layup and Oladipo's 3-pointer with 3:58 left pushed the lead to 113-98. Indiana (4-2) placed six players in double figures. Collison, Myles Turner and Sabonis each scored 15 points while Thaddeus Young added 10. ""We didn't want to make it a trap game,"" Collison said. ""Every team in the NBA is respectable, regardless of who is out there. They played as hard as we did tonight."" Rodney Hood led Cleveland with 17 points while Larry Nance Jr. came off the bench to score 15. Cleveland has struggled without James, who signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency while Love leads the team with 19 points a game. Indiana went ahead for good midway through the second quarter. Oladipo scored on a layup, a dunk and a jumper as Indiana turned a four-point deficit into a 60-55 halftime lead. The Pacers' run continued in the third quarter. Oladipo and Bogdanovic hit 3-pointers, and Collison knocked down a jumper from the corner and scored in the lane, to lead 81-66. Indiana guard Tyreke Evans sat out the game because of a violation of team rules. In a tweet posted by the team Friday, Evans said he was late for practice. He's expected to play Monday against Portland. LOVE UPDATE The five-time All-Star, who leads the team scoring 19 points a game, also missed Thursday's game against Detroit. Love missed three of the Cavaliers' four exhibition games because of the injury, and it's uncertain when he'll return. ""He tried to play through it understanding we hadn't won a game and we were struggling a little bit,"" Lue said. ""He wanted to be on the floor and try to make a difference. We applaud him for that. We just hope he can get healthy soon."" TEAM WIN Coach Nate McMillan was pleased with the way the Pacers played in the final two quarters. ""In the second half, we got stops when we needed to and really just wore them down,"" he said. ""We did a good job recognizing where we had matchups."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana's depth has been a major factor in the early going. Six players average in double figures and two others scored nine points a game. ... Evans is averaging 12 points in five games in his first season with the team. Cavaliers: Rookie Collin Sexton was assessed a technical foul after swatting away Cory Joseph's hand as the Pacers guard was battling for position on an inbounds play. Sexton, taken with the eighth pick in the first round of the draft, had 12 points but was 2 of 8 from the field. ""There's going to be ups and downs,"" Lue said. ""I just don't want him to get down on himself. He's going to make mistakes and that's just part of the game."" ...  F Sam Dekker started in place of Love, scoring six points with five rebounds in 24 minutes.","401070758"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The ""3-and-D"" approach fit Philadelphia's Robert Covington perfectly. Covington hit a key 3-pointer down the stretch and made Charlotte star Kemba Walker work hard for every point, helping the 76ers defeat the Hornets 105-103 on Saturday night. Joel Embiid had 27 points and 14 rebounds and J.J. Redick and also hit a key 3-pointer late. The game was tied at 99 after Walker's 3-pointer with 3:04 left. Redick put the 76ers ahead 102-99 with 2:03 left by nailing a 3 from the left wing. Walker answered with a layup to pull Charlotte within one, but Covington drained a 3-pointer from the right wing five seconds later to make it 105-101. Covington finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds. He also chased the speedy and talented Walker all over the court. Walker scored 37 points but needed 31 shots, finishing 11-for-31 from the field. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown credited Covington. ""Covington's best game of the year,"" Brown said. ""He ended up being our bell-ringer. He had that big 3 to really seal the game. He was very good tonight."" Embiid also was his usual good self despite being game-time decision after injuring his left ankle in practice on Friday. But the Philadelphia big man didn't favor his ankle at all while recording his sixth double-double in as many games to start the season. ""I'm good,"" he said. Ben Simmons contributed 14 points and 12 rebounds for Philadelphia, which evened its record at 3-3. The Philadelphia point guard credited Covington. ""Covington's amazing game on Kemba made it tough for him to score,"" he said. Walker entered second behind Steph Curry in 3-point attempts (64) and 3-pointers made (29) but went just 3-for-15 from the arc on Saturday. The two-time All-Star had 30 points, hitting 11 of 18 from the field, in Friday's 135-106 win over Chicago. Hornets coach James Borrego acknowledged that the back-to-back situation likely affected Walker. ""Sometimes those shots don't fall with tired legs,"" he said. Overall, though, Borrego liked his team's performance. ""Great effort, especially defensively,"" he said. ""I'm really proud how they battled."" Following Covington's 3-pointer, the Hornets missed all four of their field-goal attempts from that point, with Walker's two free throws with 2.6 seconds left accounting for their final points. Neither team led by more than six points in a tightly contested second half. The 76ers erased an 85-83 deficit to start the fourth by scoring six straight to open the period and take an 89-85 lead with 10:50 left. Second-year guard Markelle Fultz electrified the crowd with a one-handed fastbreak dunk during the spurt. Fultz also drew cheers with a first-half spinning layup and a third-quarter baseline jumper. The second-year guard re-worked his jump shot over the summer after shooting struggles during an injury-plagued season last year. TIP-INS Hornets: G Tony Parker (rest) didn't play.  . Rookie Miles Bridges had 14 points. 76ers: Wilson Chandler (hamstring) missed his sixth straight game to start the season. . Embiid has a double-double in every game this season. .

"MIAMI --  These are the games where Goran Dragic likes to prove his worth, the ones against a fellow All-Star point guard. And make no mistake, Portland's Damian Lillard was great. But when it mattered most, Dragic came through for Miami. Dragic scored 28 points, outscoring Portland 8-7 by himself in the final 3:52, and Heat scrambled in the final minutes to beat the Trail Blazers 120-111 on Saturday night. Miami led by as many as 19, then found itself trailing twice in the fourth quarter and pulled out a late rally on a night when Lillard went for 42 points. ""We knew they were going to make their run,"" said Dragic, who went over the career 10,000-point mark in the first half. ""We knew we just had to stick to our game plan and we did."" Lillard played through what he said was ""a little hyperextension"" of his right elbow, something that happened when he got caught on a screen, but he still made 15 of 28 shots. ""I knew that it would eventually be a game,"" Lillard said. ""That's what we do. We kept grinding."" The Heat made their final five shots, the last four of them from 3-point range -- two by Dragic including the one that put Miami up for good, one by Josh Richardson and another by Rodney McGruder. Kelly Olynyk and Dwyane Wade each had 19 for Miami, which got 14 from McGruder, 11 from Richardson and a 16-rebound, six-block effort from Hassan Whiteside. CJ McCollum scored 19 for Portland, and Zach Collins finished with 13. ""I thought they made some timely shots,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Lillard's 3-pointer with 5:38 left gave Portland its first lead since the opening minutes at 99-96, and a pair of free throws by Collins kept the Trail Blazers' lead at three with just under four minutes left. From there, it was all Miami -- sparked by a brilliant play from Dragic. In transition, he slowed at the top of the 3-point arc knowing that he was about to get slammed into by Collins. The foul got called, Dragic made two of the three free throws, and his 3-pointer with 2:34 left put Miami ahead for good. ""It turned the momentum or at least showed it down,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""A very heady play."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard eclipsed the 11,000-point mark; he came into the night 31 shy of that, and had 32 through three quarters. ... Portland was outscored by 11 points in the opening quarter. The Blazers hadn't lost any quarter by more than four points in their first four games. ... Moe Harkless played 10 first-half minutes, and then didn't return because of left knee soreness. ... The 111 points were a season low for Portland. Heat: Dragic became the first Slovenian player to reach the 10,000-point mark in the NBA. He entered with 9,994. ... Wade made four 3-pointers in the first half -- the first time he had four 3s in a half since Nov. 19, 2016, for Chicago against the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Justise Winslow (hamstring tightness) made his season debut and finished with 10 points. Wayne Ellington (ankle) was cleared to make his, but did not play. VETERAN SPARK Wade sparked an immediate 9-0 run the first time he checked into the game, and before long the Heat had total control of the early going. His fadeaway 3-pointer less than 2 minutes into the second gave Miami a 41-22 lead, the end of what was a 28-7 Heat spurt that took about 7 1/2 minutes. Wade's falling-down, from-behind-the-backboard 3 with less than a second left sent Miami into the break with a 57-42 cushion. ""I didn't even see it go in,"" Wade said. EVEN STOTTS The loss lowered Stotts' career record to 390-390. While his Portland teams have consistently been very good, his career record has somehow never been better than two games over .500.","401070760"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Despite a bit of a youth movement, it's still the Marc Gasol and Mike Conley show for the Memphis Grizzlies -- with a good amount of defense mixed in. Memphis, held Phoenix to 46 percent shooting, including the Suns connecting on only 9 of 33 shots outside the arc in a 117-96 victory Saturday night. ""I think defense is what really keys and starts our offense for us,"" said Conley, who finished with 18 points and seven assists. ""Gives us easy opportunities. Gives us a different flow, a different rhythm. .It allows us to play with a little more pace and get guys more opportunities."" Gasol led the Memphis scoring with 19 points. MarShon Brooks, like Conley, had 18 points, Garrett Temple added 15, and Wayne Selden 14. ""We want to be a versatile offensive team where you can't key in on one or two guys to shut us down,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""It's good to see a bunch of guys get double-figure points. That means we're sharing the ball well."" With Suns leading scorer Devin Booker out nursing a left hamstring strain, it was up to Deandre Ayton, the first overall pick in last summer's draft, to do his part. He led Phoenix, scoring 24 points -- tops for his young season -- and had eight rebounds. But he didn't get a lot of offensive help to replace Booker's missing 28 points a game. Guard Isaiah Canaan was the only other starter reaching double figures, scoring 11 points. Rookie Elie Okobo came off the bench for 12 points, and Jamal Crawford added 11. The Suns have lost four straight. While Memphis took a first-quarter lead, the advantage was built in the second, when the Grizzlies outscored Phoenix 42-25 for a 68-43 halftime lead. ""We came out lackadaisical with the turnovers and stuff,"" Ayton said. ""They started getting (into) a rhythm early, and they started making a lot of shots in the first half, especially in the second quarter."" From there, Memphis would extend it to 26 midway through the fourth quarter, leading both coaches to start clearing their benches. ""We are repeating the same mistakes. Turnovers, obviously.""

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks proved they could thrive, at least temporarily, without their franchise player. With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined to start the second half while being evaluated for a possible concussion, the Bucks built a big third-quarter lead and cruised to a 113-91 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. The Bucks have won six consecutive games to start the season, one shy of the record set by the 1971-72 team. The win sets up a Monday night showdown in Milwaukee with the Toronto Raptors, the league's only other unbeaten team. Antetokounmpo, who finished with 21 points in a season-low 19 minutes, fell to the floor underneath the basket midway through the first quarter after catching an elbow from the Magic's Aaron Gordon. ""I just got hit in the head,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I tried to block the shot. I fell down. I don't remember much after that. I have to be careful with that. We did some (concussion) tests in the second quarter and some additional tests in the third quarter."" When asked what he remembered about the play, Antetokoumpo said he was ""probably knocked out."" ""I just remember the hit. But I'm fine,"" he said. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer noted that Antetokounmpo continued to play close to his normal minutes in the first half after the blow to the head before being sent back to the locker room to undergo further tests after halftime. Antetokounmpo played 3 minutes in the fourth quarter. ""We just wanted to be extra cautious, make sure everything was OK and give him an extra look,"" Budenholzer said. Gordon described Antetokounmpo as ""tough"" for coming back out on the court. ""He is resilient. I hit him with the elbow, unintentionally,"" Gordon said. ""It was hard. Props to him for coming back into the game."" Khris Middleton added 18 points and Malcolm Brogdon scored 16 for the Bucks, who were coming off a 125-95 blowout of the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road on Friday night in which they made 19 3-pointers on 46 attempts, both season highs. Milwaukee connected on just 10 of 30 shots from long range against the Magic. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and nine rebounds for Orlando. D.J. Augustin added 11, all in the first half. The Magic shot 32 percent from the field overall and 23 percent from 3-point range. ""We didn't do a good job playing our game tonight,"" Vucevic said. The Magic attempted a franchise-record 43 3-pointers and made 10. ""It is part of our game plan to have a lot of us shooting 3s and space the floor,"" Vucevic said. ""Our 3s tonight weren't exactly good ones. You can't just shoot any shot. You've got to make sure you work for the right one."" After a tightly contested first quarter in which Orlando led by five at one point, the Bucks took control in the second and built a 14-point lead at the half. Antetokounmpo had 15 first-half points, while Middleton had 12. Milwaukee's lead grew to 26 in the third with Antetokoumpo on the bench for the entire period. The Bucks closed the quarter on an 11-1 run and headed to the fourth with a 93-68 lead. LESS WEAR AND TEAR Although it took a shot to the head to keep him off the court on Saturday night, Antetokounmpo only logged 23 minutes of playing time on Friday night in the blowout win. He said he appreciates the rest during back-to-back games.

"LeBron James details the thought process in the last few seconds when the Lakers had a chance to tie the Spurs. (0:52) SAN ANTONIO -- The Spurs are still working to develop a comfort and chemistry with one another, but have already discovered they can count on DeMar DeRozan to come through late. DeRozan had 30 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and the Spurs rallied in the fourth quarter, overcoming 35 points and 11 rebounds from LeBron James to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 110-106 on Saturday night. DeRozan had 14 points in the second half, including eight in the fourth quarter, for his second double-double in five games after failing to get any last season with Toronto. ""Whenever we're down, it's kind of natural to me to just try to be more aggressive,"" DeRozan said. ""Go out there, whether it's to score or try to find guys and just try to get us going."" San Antonio fed off the energy, rebounding from a 20-point loss against Indiana as Gregg Popovich became the fifth coach to win 1,200 games and the first to do so with one team. The Spurs' first lead came at 93-91 with 10 minutes remaining when DeRozan laid in his own miss after beating three Lakers to the rebound. ""I just wanted to kind of get that bucket, kind of get the crowd into it, get your teammates into it, the bench gets into and we all kind of feed off the energy after that,"" he said. San Antonio would build the lead to eight points before James cut it to 106-105 with four straight points an assist to Josh Hart on a 3-pointer. DeRozan responded with a fadeaway jumper on Hart with 15.9 seconds remaining to help preserve the lead and the eventual win. ""When you have those games where your offense isn't clicking like it is, you've got to be able to rely on your defense, and we did that tonight,"" James said. ""We were down one, they had the ball, and DeRozan hit a tough, tough two over Josh. We did our job, and that's all you can ask for."" The Spurs also tried to lock in defensively after struggling offensively for much of the game. San Antonio entered the game allowing 121.8 points, but held Los Angeles to 46 points in the second and 18 in the final quarter. ""That sort of thing is what we're used to and that's really the first time this year that we've done that,"" Popovich said. ""If that can become a habit you have a good opportunity to win a lot of games We're not there yet we're not going to be consistent at that right nowbut we did do it tonight and that was great."" The Lakers shot 53 percent in the first half and led by as many as 14 points. Kyle Kuzma, who made his first two 3-pointers, finished with 15 points for Los Angeles. Lance Stephenson added 14 points, including a 3-pointer at the close of the first quarter that he punctuated by posing for the fans sitting courtside. DeRozan scored eight points in the final four minutes of the first half, including an emphatic dunk between two defenders, to cut a 13-point lead into a more manageable 60-54 deficit entering the third quarter. The Spurs tied it at 71 with 6:52 remaining in the third, but the Lakers went on a 17-6 run to reclaim a double-digit lead.

"NEW YORK --  Golden State appeared on its way to another easy victory when the game suddenly turned into a 3-point shootout. Luckily for the Warriors, they have the perfect guy for that. Stephen Curry set another NBA record by making seven 3-pointers and finished with 35 points as the Warriors held on to beat the Brooklyn Nets 120-114 on Sunday. Kevin Durant added 34 for the Warriors, who were coasting before the Nets made it close with some sizzling shooting behind the arc. Curry finally turned them back when his final 3-pointer made it 115-108 with 1:07 to play. He has made at least five 3s in all seven games, breaking George McCloud's record of six games in a row during the 1995-96 season. ""They got hot in the fourth to try to make it interesting, but made enough plays down the stretch to obviously get the win,"" Curry said. Klay Thompson continued to struggle behind the arc, going 1 for 5 and falling to 5 for 36 this season. He finished with 18 points and still hasn't had a 20-point outing this season. D'Angelo Russell scored 25 points and Caris LeVert had 23 for the Nets, who made 20 3-pointers in 42 attempts and cut a 19-point deficit down to two. ""I think the 3-pointer got them back in the game and ended up we had to play a little bit and execute down the stretch, so it was a solid outing for us,"" Durant said. Golden State has won four in a row since its lone loss and the previous three were all by at least 20 points. The franchise record is four straight 20-point victories, set by the San Francisco Warriors in 1966-67, and it appeared the Warriors were going to equal that. Curry scored 16 points in the first quarter. The Nets hung close until midway through the second, and another 3 by Curry pushed it to 63-44 with 1:55 remaining in the half. ""The way the first half went we easily could have kind of folded and that's not what kind of guys we have in that locker room,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They're a resilient bunch and I thought they competed their tails off and it was good for the fans to see that we didn't just succumb to their talent or their aura so to speak."" Draymond Green had a season-high 13 assists. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston missed the game with a sore right foot. ... Thompson met before the game with 14 young players from the Caribbean who are part of the NBA's Jumpstart program.

Kerr said they had a good talk since and the volatile center understands things are different with the Warriors than his previous teams. ""That kind of stuff is not going to help us win a championship, it's not going to help his reputation and I think he understands that,"" Kerr said. SOMBER SPEAKING A somber Kerr said the sad thing about the shooting that killed 11 in a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday is that he's not surprised when it happens because there is so much gun violence and division in the U.S. ""We're broken right now and so nothing surprises us anymore, or nothing surprises me anymore,"" Kerr said. ""Shootings at schools and churches, synagogues, malls, movie theaters, and we need our leaders to step up and unite the country with the appropriate words and the appropriate actions and we're not getting that right now. It's frustrating and I don't know what else to say."" Kerr said he planned to vote for all candidates who back gun control and safety. His father, Malcolm Kerr, a professor who served as president of the American University of Beirut, was shot and killed outside his office in the war-torn Lebanese capital in 1984.","401070764"
"DALLAS --  It's something special when Utah's Rudy Gobert and Dallas' DeAndre Jordan face each other. Centers Gobert and Jordan recorded their sixth straight double-doubles in six games this season, but it was the Jazz who emerged with the win, defeating the Mavericks 113-104 in a sloppy game Sunday night. Gobert finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds, and Jordan added 12 points, 4 for 4 from the line, 19 rebounds and a career-high nine assists. ""Any time you play against another top center in the league, I'm sure it's going to be a challenge,"" Jordan said. ""But it's fun, I'm a competitor and I'm sure he is too."" Any rivalry between them is not bitter. ""It's friendly,"" Jordan said. ""We're always going to talk smack, but you know it's just part of the game."" Gobert has had his way with the Mavericks in the past but noticed a difference since Jordan arrived in Dallas this season from the Clippers. ""It makes a big difference when you have a guy that can rebound, that can protect the basket,"" Gobert said. ""He brings a lot of attention when he runs to the basket, so I think it changes the team for sure."" The Jazz overcame 18 turnovers and won going away after taking a five-point lead, 82-77, into the fourth quarter. Donovan Mitchell scored 20 points for Utah. Jae Crowder added 15 points and Joe Ingles had 12. Jazz coach Quin Snyder said his team doesn't rely on any one player. ""We're not about our starters, we are not about our bench and we are not about any one player,"" he said. Examples were second-year man Georges Niang and rookie Grayson Allen, who exceeded or equaled their NBA high point totals. Dennis Smith Jr. kept Dallas in the game with strong second-half shooting, going 9 for 12 from the field, including 7 for 7 with two 3-pointers for 16 points in the third quarter. He had 21 of his game-high and career-high-tying 27 points in the second half. Wesley Matthews scored 22, Luka Doncic added 14 and Maxi Kleber had 11 for Dallas. Jordan explained how he could have three more assists than his previous high total. ""I'm up there at the top of the key a lot trying to make plays. Wes and Dennis and Harrison (Barnes) do a great job of cutting and it was easier to find those guys today."" The first quarter ended with Utah leading 26-19. Dallas shot 26 percent (6 for 23) from the field in the period. In contrast, the Jazz were 11 for 16 (69 percent) from the field in the second quarter. Nine Utah turnovers in the quarter helped Dallas stay within 50-46 at halftime. Despite Smith's 16 points in the third quarter, the Jazz outscored Dallas 32-31. TIP-INS Jazz: F Derrick Favors did not play because of a sore left knee. ... Jae Crowder left the game after rolling an ankle. X rays were negative. ... Second-year F Georges Niang had a career-high 13 points. Rookie Grayson Allen tied his NBA high with 11. Mavericks: PG Dennis Smith Jr. returned after missing a game with a sprained right ankle. ... G Devin Harris missed his fifth straight game because of a strained left hamstring. Coach Rick Carlisle said Harris could return to play on Wednesday against the Lakers. TALKING A GOOD GAME Jordan, a career 45-percent free throw shooter, made all four attempts against. Utah, and is 26 for 30 (87 percent) this season. When he goes to the line now, he talks to the player lined up to his left, and then to his right, before shooting as a technique to relax and improve his concentration. BALANCE Eight players tied for the scoring lead in the first quarter. Five Utah players and three Mavericks each scored four. At halftime, Jazz G Donovan Mitchell was the only player in double figures.","401070765"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder didn't care that Phoenix had just one win this season, was playing the second game of a back-to-back and was missing its leading scorer. They just wanted to get a win. Oklahoma City finally broke through for the first time in five tries this season. Paul George and Russell Westbrook each scored 23 points, and the Thunder beat the Suns 117-110 on Sunday. ""It feels special,"" guard Dennis Schroder said. ""I think we can build off of that win. We're going to keep getting better. It was a good one tonight."" Nerlens Noel had 20 points and 15 rebounds and Patrick Patterson added 17 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City's victory left the Cleveland Cavaliers, who fired coach Tyronn Lue on Sunday, as the league's only winless team. Thunder center Steven Adams did not play after experiencing tightness in his left calf during pregame warmups, and Noel started in his place. Coach Billy Donovan was pleased with the way Noel performed in his first start. ""He did a lot of really good things,"" Donovan said. ""He was really, really active. He was very active defensively. He scored some points on some lobs and some rolls and he got to the free-throw line. I was really, really impressed with his defense."" Noel has started 159 of his 228 career games, so he was comfortable in the role. ""Just do this on a nightly basis, just being a professional, ready for whatever is thrown at me in this position,"" he said. ""Steven wasn't able to go, so I just kept the same mindset of being able to be ready, no matter what. I knew if I was coming off the bench, if I was starting, I'd play the same way. That's about it."" Rookie Elie Okobo scored 18 points and No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton added 16 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Devin Booker, who entered the day as the league's ninth-best scorer at 27.8 points per game, sat out his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. The Thunder led 62-48 at halftime after shooting 49 percent from the field. George scored 15 points before the break, while Westbrook made just two field goals. The Thunder blew a 16-point halftime lead against Boston on Thursday, so the threat of falling apart still was there. Westbrook hit back-to-back layups to make it 82-65 in the third. George drained a shot from just beyond half court at the third-quarter buzzer to put Oklahoma City up 96-76. ""It's one of the funnest basketball games I've played in since I've been here,"" Noel said. ""Guys just play so unselfish. This team is really built the right way. Guys just want to make winning plays, and everybody is going to excel when the play style is like that."" Phoenix outscored the Thunder 34-21 in the fourth quarter. ""A lot of positives in the game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""You're not going to feel better -- we lost the game. But effort was there. I think we tried, and we tried for 48 minutes.""

"LOS ANGELES --  In a season where putting up lots of points has been a nightly occurrence, the Los Angeles Clippers have also been trying to win with their defense. Tobias Harris scored 22 points to lead nine players in double-figures as the Los Angeles Clippers coasted to a 136-104 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. ""It was because of our defense,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Everybody's excited about the offense, but its the defense that does the dirty work and allows everybody to score."" Lou Williams added 17 points on his 32nd birthday for the Clippers, who shot 54 percent from the field, made 16-of-29 3-pointers, and outrebounded Washington 57-45. ""As a team, we want to not only be known as an offensive team in the West, but a defensive team as well,"" said Avery Bradley who had 15 points. ""We know defense wins games, and that's our mentality going into games."" Two nights after posting a 133-113 road victory over the Houston Rockets, the Clippers held the Wizards to a season-low in points and won for the fourth time in their last five games. ""We know what we have in the locker room,"" said Clippers guard Patrick Beverley. ""Whatever the standings might be, whatever is said on paper, you've got to play the game. And we like to play the game."" Bradley Beal scored 20 points and John Wall added 18 for Washington, which shot 40 percent and missed 22 of 27 3s. The Wizards are 1-5 this season and have lost 11 in a row to the Clippers in Los Angeles, dating back to Feb. 13, 2008. ""Our defense was horrendous. I don't know how we expect to win,"" said Wizards reserve guard Austin Rivers. ""Teams are just walking into the paint, making layups, getting open threes. It just comes from effort and talking. You've just got to have personal pride. You've got to get mad when somebody scores on you."" After Washington pulled within 81-71, the Clippers ran off 16 unanswered points, including three 3-pointers by Patrick Beverley, for a 97-71 lead with 2:15 left in the third. The Wizards missed three shots and turned the ball over twice in the run. Leading 21-18, the Clippers capped a 14-2 spurt with a 3-pointer by Williams for a 35-20 advantage with 10:58 left in the second quarter. After two free throws by Jeff Green, back-to-back lay-ins by Harris gave Los Angeles its biggest lead to that point at 42-24 with 9:24 left in the half. The Wizards got within 52-45 only to see the Clippers expand their lead to 69-54 by halftime. Back-to-back dunks by Harris early in the third quarter put Los Angeles up 77-60 with 8:26 left in the third. We have to be one of the best teams chemistry-wise,"" Harris said of the Clippers. ""It's just a matter of us continuing to build on that, and I think we've still got a ways to go in that department."" TIP-INS Wizards: Markieff Morris (flu-like symptoms) was a game-time decision. The Wizards were playing their fourth of five road games, their longest trip of the season, and fourth straight in the Pacific Time Zone. ... Dwight Howard (gluteal soreness) missed his fifth straight game working out back in Washington. Clippers: Avery Bradley's 3-pointer with 4:58 left in the first quarter, his third of the game, was the 600th of his NBA career.

Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) sat out his second straight game. FAMILY REUNION The game was the first in which Doc Rivers coached against his son, Austin Rivers, since Austin was traded by the Clippers to the Wizards in June after four years with the lippers. ""In New Orleans (in 2014), at least the first time, it was really cool. I didn't even know what to do. Shake his hand? Wish him luck?"" said Doc Rivers. ""Now, you just want to beat him. And he wants to beat me. That's the way it is."" MULTIPLE MILESTONES With his fourth rebound with 3:59 left in the half, Marcin Gortat moved past Al Horford into 15th place on the NBA's all-time Total Rebound list, and finished with seven for the game, putting him at 6,153 rebounds for his career. John Wall played his 547th game for the Wizards, moving him into 9th place on the team's all-time list, one behind Jeff Malone. RIVERS HOT OVER LUE Doc Rivers did not mince words when asked about the Cavaliers decision to fire Tyronn Lue on Sunday. ""We talked for a long time because he's really disappointed,"" said Rivers. ""But he has a lot to be proud of. He did a heck of a job in extreme circumstances. I'm probably no prouder of anybody who's played for me and been a coach under me than Ty Lue. It makes me so angry when you see stuff like that, but there's nothing you can do about it. He handled it better than me. He handled it with amazing class, thanked everybody.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Portland Trail Blazers may not need to rely exclusively on their dynamic duo to throw scoring punches any longer. Their new supporting cast trades jabs pretty well, too, and it could make a real difference to their long-term prospects. With Damian Lillard struggling Monday and C.J. McCollum scoring just 17 points, the Blazers got 17 points from Zach Collins and the first career double-double from former Purdue star Caleb Swanigan to put away the Indiana Pacers 103-93. ""They've been great for us all season. They've been keeping us alive all season,"" McCollum said, referring to Portland's bench. ""They're the difference between us being an average team and a really good team."" It's a series Portland has dominated. They've won three straight over Indiana and eight of the last nine, largely behind the play of Lillard who had scored at least 33 points in three of his six previous trips to Bankers Life Fieldhouse. And Lillard was coming off back-to-back 40-point games. This time the All-Star guard missed his first five shots, didn't score until the final seconds of the first half and wound up with a season-low 16 points on 5 of 13 shooting with one rebound and two assists. McCollum was 7 of 15 with six rebounds and one assist and they combined for three 3-pointers. In previous seasons, those numbers might have doomed Portland's chances. But Swanigan softened up the Pacers with his early flurry and Collins delivered the knockout punch by repeatedly scoring in the fourth quarter to help Portland pull away. ""The second unit came in and played really well,"" said Collins, who matched his career high scoring total.  ""We ran the lead up and didn't let it go down. In the second half, we did our job."" The result: Indiana lost its first home game of the season with a lackluster performance. Victor Oladipo had 21 points, nine rebounds and seven assists while Darren Collison added a season-high 17. Thaddeus Young added 16 points and Myles Turner had 10 points and nine rebounds on a night coach Nate McMillan hoped to see a stronger performance on defense and on the glass. He wasn't satisfied with much. ""We're still working on establishing ourselves as a team, what works for us as a team -- defending hard, rebounding the ball,"" McMillan said. The Pacers appeared to be cruising early in the second half when they took a 57-49 lead. But the Trail Blazers charged back quickly by scoring five straight points, retook the lead during a 10-2 run and extended their 71-69 advantage by starting the fourth quarter on an 8-2 run. Indiana didn't get closer than five the rest of the way as Swanigan had 11 points and 10 rebounds, both career bests. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Evan Turner, who once played for Indiana, was one of seven players in double figures. He had 13 points. ... Portland committed 18 turnovers, their worst total this season in a non-overtime game, but went 17 of 18 from the free-throw line and had a 50-35 rebounding edge. ... The Blazers drew four offensive foul calls in the first six minutes of the game. Pacers: The free-throw shooting woes continued as the Pacers went 13 of 20 from the line. They were also 6 of 19 on 3s. ... Turner had three blocks to tie James Edwards (391) for No. 8 on the franchise's NBA career list. ... Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri received a blue No. 4 jersey between the first and second quarters in honor of becoming the NFL's career scoring leader Sunday. THEY SAID IT Trail Blazers: ""It was a junky, slow game,"" Lillard said. Pacers: ""Those guys (Lillard and McCollum) can really score at a high level,"" Oladipo said. ""We kind of slowed them down. Unfortunately, we didn't get the win.""","401070768"
"PHILADELPHIA --  After yet another slow start by the 76ers, Ben Simmons gave restless fans and a slumping team a needed reminder of just good they can become in the East. Simmons had 21 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, and turned the game around in the decisive third quarter to lift Philadelphia to a 113-92 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. Simmons made 5 of 6 shots in the third and hit all five free throws for 15 points and helped the 76ers outscore Atlanta 31-13 in the third. ""I think we just needed a spark and I was able to provide that for the team,"" he said. ""I told the guys to keep running with me and I'll find them."" Without a major roster addition, the Sixers had played little like a team that won 52 games and a playoff round a year ago. Simmons and Joel Embiid have been solid and are making early cases for All-Star berths. But Philly's distinguished duo had little help and the Sixers had won their last two games by one and two points, respectively, and needed this win just to move above .500 (4-3). ""I think everybody gets caught up in last season. This is a different team,"" Simmons said. Here's how much expectations have soared in Philly: The Sixers were booed by fans, who showed nothing but love in the early days of ""The Process,"" as they trudged off the court tied at halftime. Simmons turned everyone around. ""He has a second gear a lot of people in this league don't have,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. He got some help in the third from the oft-maligned Markelle Fultz. Fultz, desperately trying to join Simmons and Embiid as a cornerstone trio, had a sweet stretch during which he buried an open 3, crushed a one-handed dunk in transition and had an assist on an Embiid jumper for a 78-60 lead. Fultz had season-highs with seven baskets (on 16 attempts) and 16 points in 23 minutes. ""I'm a great basketball player,"" Fultz said. ""I think I can do pretty much anything. I can pass the ball, I can pull up the 3, I can get to the rim. I just think I have an all-around game."" That was enough to help send Atlanta to its second straight loss. Kent Bazemore led the Hawks with 18 points. ""We still had energy, but it's their own court and they definitely fed off the energy from the crowd, made a few shots, and got on a few big runs,"" Hawks guard Trae Young said. ""We weren't able to stop them."" The Sixers aren't much more than Embiid and Simmons and some needed 3s from JJ Redick. The Hawks sagged off Fultz most of the game and dared him to shoot jumpers. Dario Saric, one of the early parts of ""The Process,"" has seemingly lost his shot, much the same way Fultz did. Saric missed all seven shots in the first half (including four 3s) and finished 1 of 9 overall for four points. ""He looked heavy-legged to me,"" coach Brett Brown said. TIP-INS Hawks: The Hawks were outrebounded 64-47. ... Hit just eight 3s. ... Shot 37 percent from the floor. 76ers: Brown said Wilson Chandler's return from an injured left hamstring is not far off. ... Movie director M. Night Shyamalan was at the game. ... Mike Muscala hit four 3s. WELCOME BACK Pierce made a homecoming of sorts after spending five years on Brown's staff with the Sixers. Pierce said he owed Brown so much for helping him become a head coach. ""He's passionate. He's got energy all the time,"" Pierce said. ""He cares about the players."" Pierce said he's kept in touch with Brown and former players who have wished him well in his new gig. ""These guys are happy I'm in the position that I'm in,"" Pierce said. Brown said having a coaching tree was one of the responsibilities of the job. FULTZ FOCUS Fultz, the No. 1 pick of the 2017 draft, had a nice spin move and hit an 8-footer in the lane in the second quarter and seemed most confident running the show and not playing with Simmons. ""There is zero doubt in my mind that it's his best position now,"" Brown said. ""What can he be? What he can grow to? I don't know. But his position now is with the ball and as a point guard."" FAMILIAR FACES Hawks rookie Omari Spellman is coming off a national championship at Villanova and third-year forward DeAndre' Bembry from Saint Joseph's both had plenty of local fans in the house. Pierce said Bembry is playing with confidence after missing chunks of his first two seasons with injuries. ""He's happy he's getting an opportunity to play,"" Pierce said. Pierce said Spellman was making an impact, even with spotty minutes. But not every hoops fan in Philly is part of Nova Nation. One fan yelled out, ""Spellman, you're a D-League player!""","401070769"
"MIAMI --  Sacramento's offensive approach was not exactly elaborate: Run, run, run and keep running. Once the Kings got rolling, Miami had no answers. Willie Cauley-Stein scored 26 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, Buddy Hield added 23 points and the high-octane Kings put their youthful athleticism on full display in getting past the Heat 123-113 on Monday night -- putting up huge numbers even after sputtering through the first quarter. ""We ain't had this energy in a while here, so this energy is just refreshing,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""It's fun to play like this, playing fast, everyone getting the touches, everybody sharing the energy. It's just fun to play."" De'Aaron Fox scored 20 points and Nemanja Bjelica added 19 for the Kings, who outscored Miami 77-55 in the middle two quarters and won on the Heat's home floor for the second consecutive season. The Kings outscored Miami 68-38 in the paint, and 27-9 off turnovers. ""You've got some teams that are special offensively,"" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. ""That team ... they're just go-go-go. That was like a conditioning test out there. They're using their strengths as a team. That's the league, man."" Josh Richardson scored a career-high 31 points for Miami, which got an NBA season-high 24 rebounds from Hassan Whiteside, one shy of his career high. Whiteside also had 16 points and five blocked shots for the Heat. ""We like to play at pace, but it has to be on our terms,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And that was fully on their terms."" It was tied at the half, and Sacramento ran away in the third. Hield had 14 points in the third quarter, six of them starting what became a 14-4 Kings run that gave them an 82-65 lead. Cauley-Stein added 11 in that pivotal quarter, one where the Kings put up 43 points -- their best one-period total in nearly three years. ""I was running the floor and my teammates were finding me in rhythm,"" Hield said. ""That was the big thing."" Goran Dragic scored 20 and Tyler Johnson had 11 for Miami, which led 28-17 after the first and was outscored by 21 the rest of the way. ""The biggest part about early in the game is we didn't go away,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said.

This is only the second time in the last 12 years that Sacramento (4-3) has had a winning record after seven games. The Kings were 5-2 at this point in 2014-15. Heat: Miami has scored at least 90 points in each of its last 37 regular-season-games, tying the franchise record (done twice previously, most recently in the 2004-05 season). ... It was the first -- and last -- time that Wade played in what became a home loss to Sacramento.

"NEW YORK --  His mouth bloodied, Tim Hardaway Jr. ran to the locker room shortly before halftime. Then he came back and helped the Knicks run all over the Nets. Hardaway scored 25 points and tied a career high with eight assists, and New York rolled to its second win of the season, beating Brooklyn 115-96 on Monday night. Frank Ntilikina added 16 points and Enes Kanter had 15 points and 15 rebounds off the bench for the Knicks, who had dropped five straight since beating Atlanta in their first game under David Fizdale. ""He preaches competitors only when you step through these doors, so we can't only preach it we've got to go out and do it,"" Hardaway said after removing a blood-stained pad from his mouth so he could talk. ""So we did it tonight."" They ended their skid emphatically, outscoring the Nets 59-41 over the middle two quarters and leading by as many as 25 points. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 17 points for the Nets, who dropped their third straight. They were coming off a close loss to Golden State on Sunday, and either didn't have legs left or didn't put forth much effort, getting beaten to loose balls and unable to slow the Knicks in transition in the third quarter. ""We weren't ready to play,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We can look for excuses, but this is game five (actually seven). This isn't game 74. We should have been more ready."" The Nets beat the Knicks 107-105 on Oct. 19 on Caris LeVert's layup with a second to play. This time, LeVert was 2 for 11 for just four points. The game began to swing just before halftime, when Hardaway had a couple baskets in an 8-0 spurt that pushed a two-point edge to 52-42. He also was hit in the mouth during that span while drawing an offensive foul and ran to the locker room to get his lip glued so he could return for the second half. When he did, the Knicks put it away quickly. Rookie Mitchell Robinson's steal and dunk capped a quick run of six points that made it 58-44 and led to a Nets timeout that did nothing to halt the Knicks' momentum. Hardaway made a 3 and soon after threw one of his best passes, a lob that Robinson slammed down to make it 69-48. ""I think Tim has always had the reputation that he's just a gunner and so I want to break that stereotype of him,"" Fizdale said. ""And to be an elite player in this league you have to make other people better."" The Nets took their third timeout of the quarter when Damyean Dotson made a layup while being fouled as the lead ballooned to 75-50. TIP-INS Nets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 16 points. ... Brooklyn was 11 for 38 (29 percent) from 3-point range after making 44.3 percent over its last five games. Knicks: Fizdale kept the same starting lineup he used Friday against Golden State, with Hardaway, Ntilikina, Dotson and Robinson joined by Noah Vonleh. RASHEED'S ROLE Rasheed Wallace, who finished his career with the Knicks in 2013, was in practice over the weekend and worked with rookie big man Robinson. Fizdale called Wallace one of the smartest players he's ever been around and hoped he could teach the second-round pick how to be vocal on defense. Fizdale added that Wallace would be with the team a couple more days and he'd like to have other veterans work with his young team, saying the Knicks have talked to Chauncey Billups about coming. CARIS CRASHES LeVert had a career-high 28 points in the first meeting. He came in averaging 21.3 points and shooting 51.6 percent from the field. ""The good thing about the NBA is a day off and we play again on Wednesday and a chance to redeem myself,"" he said.","401070771"
"CHICAGO --  Klay Thompson popped to the wing off a screen from Stephen Curry, caught the pass from Kevin Durant and dribbled to his left before launching the record 3-pointer. The ball swished through the net. He raised both arms, pumped his fist and got mobbed. Thompson broke Curry's NBA record with 14 3-pointers and finished with 52 points to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 149-124 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday night. Thompson set the mark when he nailed a 3 with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter. He celebrated with teammates as they headed to the sideline for a timeout, with the Warriors leading 113-69. Curry hit 13 3-pointers in a win over New Orleans on Nov. 7, 2016. ""That's what I do this for is those moments that you share with your teammates,"" Thompson said. ""That's why we play basketball. It's a collective effort. And I don't know if I would be able to break these records I have gotten in my past like tonight without the system I play in or the team I play with, the guys I play with."" Thompson hadn't scored more than 19 this season and made just 5 of 36 3-pointers in the Warriors' first seven games. But he broke out in a huge way, making 14 of 24 from beyond the arc. And he did it in just 26 minutes before sitting out the fourth quarter.  About the only thing that slowed down Thompson on Monday night was when he suffered a cut above his right eye that needed two stitches in the third quarter. He returned a few minutes later sporting a yellow headband. The four-time All-Star guard hit 10 3's and scored 36 as Golden State built a 92-50 halftime lead. It was the second-highest scoring half ever by an NBA team. Phoenix had 107 in the first half of a 173-143 victory over Denver in 1990. The Warriors also set an NBA record for 3-pointers in a half with 17 through the first two quarters. ""This is what it's been like,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""I can't even tell you how lucky I am and how I feel every night watching these guys, how unselfish they are."" Curry scored 23. Kevin Durant had 14 points and eight assists. And Chicago product Alfonzo McKinnie added 19 points and 10 rebounds as the two-time defending NBA champions improved to 7-1. Zach LaVine and Antonio Blakeney led the Bulls with 21 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. scored 18. Chicago probably would have been overmatched even at full strength. But with Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine all out with injuries, this one got ugly in a hurry because of Thompson. ""He was due for a game like this,"" LaVine said. ""He saw one go in, and his eyes got as big as the basketball. It's tough after that, because they're looking for him. He's running off of screens, and you can't touch him anyway. It's tough."" Thompson nailed his first three 3-pointers and made six while scoring 22 in the first quarter. By the time the second half rolled around, the Warriors were determined to see him set the mark. And it seemed teammates were doing all they could to assist on the record shot. Durant was glad it was him. ""The most important thing was I passed it to him on his 14th,"" he said. ""And I also passed it to Steph on his 13th. ... They wouldn't have made those shots without me."" Actually, Draymond Green had the assist on Curry's record 13th 3 against New Orleans two years ago. Either way, this was quite a night. ""It's the best feeling in basketball or one of the best feelings in basketball when you touch the ball and feel like it's going in every time,"" Thompson said. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston missed his second consecutive game because of a sore right foot. He also missed two in a row last week because of a bruised left knee. ... McKinnie hit 4 of 6 3-pointers in his second NBA game in his hometown. As a rookie with Toronto last season, he played about five minutes in a game at Chicago. Bulls: Former Bulls C Joakim Noah got a standing ovation when he was shown on the video board late in the first half. He was waived by the New York Knicks with two years and $37.8 million remaining on his contract on Oct. 13.","401070772"
"MILWAUKEE --  No Giannis Antetokounmpo, no problem for the Milwaukee Bucks. With the way they're shooting from the 3-point line, the Bucks look like they can beat just about anybody in the NBA. Ersan Ilyasova scored a season-high 19 points and the Bucks cruised without the injured Antetokounmpo to beat the Toronto Raptors 124-109 on Monday night in a showdown of the NBA's last undefeated teams. Milwaukee improved to 7-0 in a marquee matchup that lost some luster with Antetokounmpo in concussion protocol and Raptors star Kawhi Leonard sitting out to rest. The Bucks' start to the season matches the 1971-72 club for best in franchise history. Milwaukee made up for Antetokounmpo's absence with another strong showing from the perimeter, with Malcolm Brogdon and Eric Bledsoe chipping in 17 points each. ""Of course we have more confidence when (Antetokounmpo) is on the floor,"" Brogdon said. ""But we have a lot of confidence even when he's not on the floor due to the system and due to the confidence that (coach Mike Budenholzer) gives us."" Serge Ibaka scored 30 points for Toronto, which had its franchise-best 6-0 start snapped. Pascal Siakam added 22. They still couldn't keep up with the Bucks, who eclipsed the 110-point mark for the seventh straight game even without the high-flying Antetokounmpo, who averages 25.0 points and 14.2 rebounds. Ilyasova, starting for Antetokounmpo, helped pick up the slack, setting the tone with an active night all over the floor and adding a team-high 10 rebounds. The Bucks didn't stop moving when they had the ball either, especially at the 3-point line. Milwaukee's 19 3-pointers tied a franchise record which was previously reached just three days ago against Minnesota. ""They dictated the tempo of the game tonight,"" Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. It was the first game in NBA history between teams with a record of 6-0 or better, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. FIRE AWAY Budenholzer wants his team to hoist 3-pointers, and an 11-3 run in the fourth quarter sparked by two 3s from Khris Middleton helped turn a 15-point advantage into a 113-90 lead with 7:39 left. The philosophy calls for 3s and proper spacing among the five players on the floor to help create 1-on-1 opportunities for Antetokounmpo. It's working without him, too. Seven players scored in double figures. ""When they see advantages, they are seeing opportunities within the confines of what we do and still trying to play unselfishly,"" Budenholzer said. NO HELP Raptors coach Nick Nurse said his team needed better help defense to stop the Bucks' cuts and straight-line drives. When the Bucks weren't taking it straight to the hoop, they were kicking the ball out for perimeter shots. ""It's a little difficult with the five-out spacing to get adjusted,"" Nurse said. ""It's not easy to guard the ball 1-on-1 in this league. It gets harder all the time."" GOING COLD The Bucks' defense tightened after allowing the Raptors to start 12 of 17 (70 percent) from the floor with 2:37 left in the first quarter. Toronto went on to shoot 31 percent from that point to the fourth quarter, when the Bucks' lead swelled to 15. ""When you're trying to get back in it and they don't go in you automatically say, `Aw man, they're shooting too much,"" Nurse said. ""But I really thought we fought and tried to stay in it."" TIP INS Raptors: Leonard was expected to sit out just Monday's game. ... Toronto went about a four-minute stretch between the first and second quarters shooting 1 of 10 from the floor to fall behind by nine with 10:06 left in the second. Bucks: Antetokounmpo was injured Saturday against Orlando. ... Ilyasova (14 points) and Thon Maker (11) were active up front in the first half to help make up for the absence of Antetokounmpo, who cheered on his teammates one row behind the bench. ... Asked what he was most surprised by in the Bucks' fast start, Budenholzer said ""I'm not a big surprise guy. I'm just happy with the way they've worked every day. It's been a good steady work ethic.""","401070773"
"LeBron James talks about the Lakers' tendency to lose in close games and the patience he maintains as a leader. (1:18) MINNEAPOLIS --  After a lethargic loss in their last game, the Minnesota Timberwolves came to life. LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers served as their spark plug. Jimmy Butler hit five of Minnesota's eight 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to finish with 32 points on 12-for-20 shooting and help the Timberwolves hang on to beat the Lakers 124-120 on Monday. ""They were playing fast, which made us play with a lot of energy, so I guess their energy kind of helped ours,"" Butler said. Karl-Anthony Towns pitched in 25 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and four blocks for the Timberwolves (3-4), who played some clutch defense just in time to fend off a late push from James. The four-time MVP had 10 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter after missing his first five shots of the night, but the Lakers (2-5) went back to Los Angeles with another uneven performance. ""We've got to get better. We know that. We talk about patience, but we can't have reoccurrence of doing the same things over and over and over again and expecting a different result,"" said James, who added 10 rebounds and seven assists on the 15th anniversary of his professional debut. ""That's insanity."" Brandon Ingram came back strong from his four-game suspension with 24 points for the Lakers. Kyle Kuzma, after scoring 11 points in the first five minutes, had only eight more over the rest of the night. The Lakers let the Wolves grab a season-high 20 offensive rebounds and committed 18 turnovers. Anthony Tolliver was perfect on four shots from the floor for the Timberwolves, including a 3-pointer to start the fourth quarter for a 96-94 lead. Butler's back-to-back swishes from behind the arc pushed the lead to 114-107. He added one more, his fifth in as many attempts in the final period, to make it 122-117. That preceded a corner miss with 16.3 seconds left by James, who had a costly turnover with 1:43 remaining when he lost the ball at the top of the key and let it drift into the backcourt. ""We've got to get better at the little things. One of those things is paying attention to details, following game plans. The game plan tonight: Keep them off the free throw line, and defensive rebounding,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""They hurt us with both of those."" BETTER EFFORT Rookie Josh Okogie, starting at shooting guard for the Wolves in place of the injured Andrew Wiggins, had a career-high 17 points. The defensive-minded Okogie was one of the catalysts for a team that lost at home to Milwaukee by 30 points on Friday night. ""Shots are going to fall. Shots aren't going to fall. But we have to have that energy every single night, and that's what's going to get us through those humps,"" said Okogie, who added four rebounds, three assists and three steals in 30 minutes. Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau remained noncommittal on keeping Okogie as part of the rotation when Wiggins is back. ""He makes things happen,"" Thibodeau said. ""He's not perfect, but he's learning, he's eager and every day he comes in with a great attitude, and I like that he's taking advantage of when he does play."" INGRAM IS IN The Lakers went with a new starting lineup to maximize their length, sliding the 6-foot-9 Ingram back to the shooting guard spot and flanking James with the sharpshooting Kuzma at power forward. They entered the night with a league-leading 22 percent of their points coming on fast breaks, but the Wolves outscored them 21-15 in transition. Ingram was 9 for 18 from the floor. ""I didn't feel tired out there,"" Ingram said. ""That was surprising."" TIP-INS Lakers: Backup forward Michael Beasley was away from the team to tend to a personal matter. He has appeared in three games, logging a total of 10 minutes. He's with his seventh different team in his 11th NBA season. ... The largest lead for the Lakers, 90-85, came on Lance Stephenson's 3-pointer with 3:28 left in the third. Timberwolves: Wiggins took part in the morning shootaround but was held out for the third straight game with the strained right quadriceps that stopped his consecutive regular-season games played streak at 243. ... Rose had 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists but missed 12 of 16 shots from the field. ... Taj Gibson had three of the team's 12 blocks, tying a season high.","401070774"
"SAN ANTONIO --  DeMar DeRozan picked himself off the court after missing a potential game-winning shot and then lifted the San Antonio Spurs, too. DeRozan had 34 points and nine assists and San Antonio withstood a 31-point outburst by Dallas rookie Luka Doncic in a 113-108 overtime victory over the Mavericks on Monday night. ""He's a really good player and he loves those moments,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of DeRozan. ""He's not afraid of failure. You know, Michael (Jordan) didn't make every shot at the end of the game, but there are very, very few people who want to be in that position all the time and (DeRozan's) one of those people who loves it. It's good to have that."" LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points and Rudy Gay had 15 points and 11 rebounds as San Antonio won its second overtime game. Popovich said Aldridge and Gay were his closers last season, but DeRozan has given the Spurs another option, and they needed it against Doncic. Dallas' 6-foot-7 wing was 11 for 18 from the field in scoring a season high. ""He's a very good player,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He certainly doesn't look surprised that this is happening."" DeRozan and Doncic battled in the final minutes of regulation and into overtime in a game that included 10 lead changes and 12 ties. DeRozan scored 18 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, while Doncic had 10 points in the same span. DeRozan made two free throws to give the Spurs a 102-101 lead with 39.1 seconds left in regulation. Doncic missed a driving layup against Aldridge, and DeRozan missed a jumper in the lane. Dennis Smith Jr. was fouled by DeRozan with 1.6 seconds remaining. The Mavericks' point guard made the first free throw, tying the game at 102-all, and missed the second. DeRozan remained sprawled face-first on the court for a few seconds after missing a jumper inside the 3-point line as regulation expired. ""I was mad at myself that I missed,"" DeRozan said. ""But like I said, if I got the opportunity again, I wasn't going to miss a big shot later in the game, and I didn't."" It was one of the few times DeRozan failed to come through on either offense or defense for the Spurs. DeRozan, who was acquired in the offseason from Toronto for Kawhi Leonard, was 12 for 21 from the field and had six rebounds and three steals. With about seven minutes remaining in regulation, DeRozan stole the ball from Wes Matthews, sprinted down court and backed up Matthews before hitting a turnaround, fadeaway jumper from 12 feet for an 89-83 lead. ""I think we have a bunch of guys that are competitive and have the same goal, that's to win,"" Aldridge said. ""I feel like that's not something hard to ask. I feel like every guy is trying to do what they can to make wins."" Smith finished with 22 points for Dallas. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas extended its franchise record to 189 straight games with at least five 3-pointers. The streak began March 9, 2016. .... DeAndre Jordan had 18 rebounds, but was held to eight points, marking the first time he has not had a double-double this season. Spurs: DeRozan has led the Spurs in scoring in all but one game this season. ... San Antonio matched a season low by holding Dallas to 18 points in the opening quarter. The Spurs also held the Lakers to 18 points in the final quarter of Saturday's victory. SO-SO GOOD Doncic played 40 minutes, including 23 in the second half and overtime, despite suffering from a strained back that put his status in question. ""So-so, but I'm not going to stop,"" Doncic said when asked how his back was. Doncic also tweaked his left ankle on a drive late in overtime, but remained in the game. FREQUENT FLYERS The Mavericks flew for the seventh straight night following Monday's loss, their fifth game in seven days. Dallas, which has played three road games since Oct. 22, is 1-4 in that stretch. ""We're in the middle of just a grind week with all this travel,"" Carlisle said. ""To hang in there and play like we did tonight is a real credit to them."" WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN Aldridge was astounded to learn Gay has three consecutive double-doubles for the first time in his career. ""First time in his career,"" Aldridge shouted with Gay nearby. ""What have you been doing all these years?"" Gay chuckled and said it's all about opportunity. ""This year I don't have Dejounte (Murray) and L.A. stealing my rebounds,"" Gay said. ""Now I can get a double-double every night.""","401070775"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets were out of sorts at times on offense -- until it really mattered. They looked lethargic on defense -- until it really, really mattered. Then, they rose to the occasion. More specifically, Gary Harris did. Harris scored nine of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and came up with a big steal late to help the Nuggets hold off the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 116-111 on Monday night after nearly squandering an 18-point lead. The Nuggets are 5-1 despite feeling like they've yet to find their rhythm. That's encouraging to Harris. ""There's a different vibe around the team,"" Harris said. ""Everybody can feel it. ... The defense could've been better tonight. But we keep getting these wins. That's the point of it all -- the wins."" Jamal Murray chipped in 23 points and Nikola Jokic had 12 points and 10 assists for his fifth double-double in six games. Nikola Mirotic came up clutch with 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who were without star Anthony Davis (sprained right elbow) and Elfrid Payton (sprained right ankle). Reserve Julius Randle added 24. Down by 18 points in the third quarter, the Pelicans cut it to 96-94 with 3:50 remaining on a layup from Jrue Holiday. Malik Beasley answered by hitting a 3-pointer and a layup to give the Nuggets all the separation they would need. Harris' steal with 38 seconds remaining wrapped it up as Denver moved to 4-0 at home. ""We knew this team wasn't going to back down,"" said Paul Millsap, who had 18 points. ""It's when we get out there and try to blow teams out is when we kind of get ourselves in trouble. Taking our time and letting the game come to us, that's when we're at our best."" The Pelicans turned the ball over 22 times, including three costly miscues down the stretch. ""You can't do that against a really good defensive team like these guys are,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We just didn't have enough firepower to finish."" Randle's thoughts exactly. ""We just dug ourselves a bit too deep at the end of the first half. That's what got us,"" Randle said. ""This was their home-court and we didn't have enough juice."" Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone warned his team about not taking the Pelicans too lightly just because they were without Davis. His message apparently didn't take root, and Denver trailed by nine points during the opening quarter. The Nuggets woke up from their slumber in the second quarter and grabbed a 58-45 lead at the break and ran the lead to 18 in the third before the Pelicans rallied. ""It's not about who we're playing. It's not about who's available,"" Malone said. ""It's about us."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Gentry said Davis is still experiencing some pain in his elbow and was held out for a second straight game as a precaution. ""I don't think it's anything that we're worried about,"" Gentry said. ... Holiday hit 2 of 3 3-pointers before fouling out. He entered the game 3 of 22. Nuggets: Reserve Trey Lyles had 17 points with his father in the stands. NIKOLA VS. NIKOLA In a faceoff of two big men with the first name Nikola, Jokic and Mirotic put on quite a show. Jokic finished a rebound shy of his second triple-double of the season. Meanwhile, Mirotic knocked down shot after shot in crunch time. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT The Nuggets took advantage of a three-day break to focus on shooting. They rank near the bottom in 3-point percentage. ""Throughout the NBA season in practice, one of the last things you do is shoot. You're working on offense, you're working on defense, special situations,"" Malone explained. ""Hopefully all that repetition will help us finally make some shots."" The team was 11 of 35 from 3-point range. CRUNCH TIME Beasley is getting more playing time with Will Barton out following surgery to fix his hip/core muscle. Beasley was in late in the fourth quarter, which was an eye-opener for him. ""I looked at the scoreboard with two minutes to go and was like, `Wow, I'm out here,"" Beasley said.","401070776"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Before the season, Tony Parker told his new Hornets teammates, ""Don't mess with my playoff streak."" He wasn't kidding. ""I was serious, because it means something,"" Parker said. ""I feel like I'm a winner. I have won a lot in this league. And I think that is why they signed me."" Parker is doing his best to make sure the Hornets get to the postseason, which would allow the longtime San Antonio Spur to reach the playoffs for the 18th straight season. Parker had 24 points and 11 assists to lead a big night from Charlotte's bench, and the Hornets beat the Miami Heat 125-113 on Tuesday night. In so doing, the 36-year-old Frenchman surpassed 19,000 career points and became the seventh international-born player to reach that milestone -- joining Dirk Nowitzki, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dominique Wilkins, Tim Duncan, Patrick Ewing and Pau Gasol. ""This is a four-time NBA champion, a lot of pride, a lot of credibility. He wants to win, and he's not satisfied with this win,"" said Hornets coach James Borrego, who also coached Parker as an assistant with the Spurs. Behind Parker, who provided a spark all game long with his scoring, passing and decision-making, Charlotte's reserves outscored Miami's 66-46. Reserve Malik Monk had 20 points and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist contributed 14 points and eight rebounds for the second unit. Nic Batum had 20 points for the Hornets, who beat the Heat for the second time in 10 days. Kemba Walker was held to a season-low 19 points, but played a big role by helping squash a fourth-quarter comeback sparked by Dwyane Wade, who led Miami with 19 points and made four 3-pointers. Walker knocked down a pair of 3s in the final 3 1/2 minutes to push Charlotte's lead back to double digits. Batum said Parker is ""just what we needed off the bench."" ""We needed that guy behind Kemba that can control the game and can push off of Kemba -- and he's doing good so far,"" said Batum, who has played with Parker on the French national team. ""I think his poise, his demeanor, his pace, it just calms everybody down,"" Borrego said of Parker. ""People find the right spots. They're in rhythm. It's not helter-skelter. He's got great rhythm there. He's been doing this for 17 years. This is a pro who has played at the highest level in big competitions and he's not fazed out there."" TIP-INS Heat: Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 12 rebounds. ... Were outrebounded 39-34 by the smaller Hornets. Hornets: The Hornets exercised their third-year option on Monk before the game. The 6-foot-3 Monk came in averaging 11 points per game in his second NBA season. He was selected 11th overall in the 2017 draft. BACK-TO-BACK WOES It was the second loss in two nights for the Heat, who gave up 123 points to the Kings on Monday. Coach Erik Spoelstra called it ""a disappointing two games."" ""Every time we had any type of momentum they just took it the other way,"" Spoelstra said. ""You have to credit them, they came out and played with great purpose and flattened us out offensively even though we scored 113. Defensively they annihilated us and broke our defense down without much resistance."" Wade didn't have an answer for Miami's defensive struggles, saying ""we've played aggressive and we've played kind of the style of defense we want to play when we get down, but we haven't done it consistently. That's the biggest thing is trying to find consistency."" TOUGH TO STOP Borrego said he is thrilled with the improvement from Monk in his second season. Monk was on the floor during a crucial stretch in the fourth quarter with Parker and Walker -- and wasn't afraid to shoot. The former Kentucky star finished 7 of 10 from the floor with four 3-pointers. ""That's tough to guard,"" Borrego said of the trio. ""There's shooting out there, there's playmaking out there, the court was spread and we're not only going to need him throughout the game, but the fourth quarter is a major time and that kid isn't afraid of the moment.""","401070777"
"CLEVELAND --  The Cavaliers played unselfishly, aggressively and together for the first time this season. They almost always do for Larry Drew. Rodney Hood scored a season-high 26 points, Cedi Osman added 20 and Cleveland ended its six-game losing streak to start the season, beating the Atlanta Hawks 136-114 on Tuesday night in the Cavs' first game since coach Tyronn Lue was fired. Cleveland came in as the NBA's only winless team, and Lue paid the price for club's slow start in its first season since LeBron James left the Cavs for the second time. But with Drew serving as their ""acting"" coach while he tries to get the team to restructure his contract, the Cavs played a complete game -- Cleveland had seven players in double figures -- and avoided their first 0-7 start since 1995-96. ""I really didn't know what was going to happen tonight,"" Drew said. ""I just wanted these guys to try and put the first six games behind them as quickly as they could and be ready to turn the chapter with a new season. They came out and took the challenge."" The Cavs improved to 10-1 in the past two years under Drew, who filled in last season while Lue battled health issues. Before the game, Drew said he was ""very disappointed"" the Cavs had not yet agreed to his request to redo his deal if he's going to lead them through what promised to be a challenging season. If Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert or GM Koby Altman needed further proof that Drew has his players' attention, they got it. ""L.D. always has had a voice,"" Hood said. ""Not as big a voice, but he's a guy who's been through the wars and he knows how to put guys in position to be successful. I think it was more about us forgetting the first six games and coming out, just playing well. Regardless of the results, let's just play well. Tonight was a good step in that."" George Hill and rookie Collin Sexton scored 17 apiece, and Tristan Thompson had 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Rookie Trae Young scored 24 and Alex Len 22 for the Hawks. Young scored a season-high 35 against the Cavs on Oct. 21, wrecking their home opener. But Atlanta made 22 turnovers and the Hawks' defense was poor in the second half when the Cavs scored 78 points. ""Tale of two halves,"" Young said. ""Started out the game, matched their effort, matched their intensity. We had a really good first half and then they made adjustments. We weren't ready to play and couldn't finish it out."" The Cavs played their third straight game without forward Kevin Love, who could miss several weeks with a painful left toe injury that has bothered him since the preseason opener. The five-time All-Star said doctors are still trying to decide the best course of treatment, and to this point he has not been told he'll need surgery. Until Love's back, the Cavs will have to replace his 19 points and 13.5 rebounds per game. Someone needs to pick up the scoring slack, and Hood could be the guy. He struggled after coming over to Cleveland at the trading deadline from Utah and never found his groove. But he had his best game for Cleveland against the Hawks, attacking the basket and knocking down all four 3-pointers. ""That's the Rodney Hood that I know,"" Drew said. ""Rodney is a passive guy by nature. That's who he is, but he is a very talented and very skilled guy and when he's aggressive like that, he's hard to defend. He can make the 3, turn the corner and get to the basket. When he gets his mid-range game, he really elevates.

ALL-STAR SELECTION The Cavs will host the 2022 NBA All-Star Game, a person familiar with the selection told The Associated Press. The league will make the announcement later this week.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Sacramento has had some success trying to outrun and outscore opponents. Against the Orlando Magic, the Kings turned to defense. Buddy Hield finished with 25 points and the Kings defeated Orlando 107-99 on Tuesday night to extend their winning streak to four games. ""We got six stops in a row,"" said coach David Joerger, referring to a 3  1/2-minute sequence after their 13-point lead was cut to three. ""We had to get some stops and we got those stops. We locked back in and made some plays."" Hield scored six points in a 13-2 run to close out the third quarter, and the Kings held on to match their longest winning streak since February 2017. The Kings' De'Aaron Fox, who played with a sore back, was doubtful until pregame warmups and struggled through a scoreless first half. Fox finished with 14 points, including eight in the fourth quarter. ""I felt like I had a great second half, a forgettable first half,"" said Fox, who added that the back did affect him. ""But I felt like I had to push through it in the second half."" Nemanja Bjelica finished with 21 points for Sacramento, and Willie Cauley-Stein added 14 points and 11 rebounds. Aaron Gordon had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, who lost their third straight. Terrence Ross came off the bench to score 17 points, and Nikola Vucevic finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds. The Magic had assists on each of their first 11 field goals and led through most of the first half. Two 3-pointers by Ross gave Orlando its biggest lead at 27-16 late in the first quarter. Sacramento led for the first time at 55-52 when Bjelica made a 3-pointer with 1:17 left in the first half. The Kings moved out to a 13-point lead before Ross and Jonathon Simmons led a fourth-quarter charge by the Magic, who got as close as 94-91 with 4:50 left. ""The inability to score in the third quarter was the biggest part of the game for us,"" said Magic coach Steve Clifford. ""Our defense ignited our offense in the fourth quarter and gave us a chance, (but) we had a couple of things we need to do better late."" But Orlando's comeback bid fizzled due to seven turnovers in the fourth period and 11-for-43 3-point shooting in the game. ""I just feel like we can never get in control of the game,"" Vucevic said.

""I was taking shots that they were giving me,"" said Irving, who made 10 of 16 shots from the floor and added five assists and five rebounds. ""Me taking some of those shots made the defense come out a little higher, then created some other opportunities for my teammates, which felt good."" Irving's effect on the game showed in the box score as well with four of his teammates also scoring in double figures as the Celtics won their third straight. Jayson Tatum scored 16, Jaylen Brown had 14 points and Al Horford scored 11 for Boston. Marcus Morris had 15 points and nine rebounds. Irving's previous high this season was 22 last Monday against Orlando. He scored just three Saturday when the Celtics beat the Pistons 109-89. ""Law of averages,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's way too good of a scorer for the ball not to go in very long and all that stuff evens out over time."" Blake Griffin had 24 points and 15 rebounds for Detroit, which couldn't recover after scoring just 13 points in the third quarter. The Pistons chopped Boston's 14-point lead down to a point with 4:21 left to play, and then again with 12 seconds remaining, but couldn't complete the comeback. ""I like how we played in stretches tonight. Playing at home, getting beat by 25,whatever it was, and then coming out and giving this type of effort is promising,"" Griffin said. ""That's what we have to do. We might not be as talented as some of these teams in the East, but we have enough talent. What's going to set us apart is our will and how we go about putting our will on the game."" Boston is still the only team to beat the Pistons this season. Andre Drummond had 17 points and 12 rebounds and Reggie Bullock scored 16 for Detroit. Ish Smith added 13 points off the bench and gave Detroit one more chance on a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left to play, pulling Detroit within 103-102. But the Celtics sealed it from the foul line. Tatum drew a foul and made both free shots with 10.5 seconds left, then Irving added two more from the line after Detroit turned the ball over on the inbound play. The Pistons led 58-56 after a high-paced first half, but fell off in the third quarter, going 4 for 17 from the floor and missing all six attempts from 3-point range. Irving took over in the third, scoring 13 and starting an early 10-0 run that put Boston up for good. ""We had to pick our energy level up,"" Brown said. Griffin hit a pair of free throws with 4:38 left in the period to pull Detroit within 70-65, but Irving responded for the Celtics with three straight 3-pointers as Boston stretched the lead to 14 points late in the period. Drummond got Detroit back in it in the fourth quarter after Griffin drove for a layup that cut Boston's lead to 88-84 with 6:01 left to play. Drummond drove for a dunk, blocked a shot by Tatum at the other end and was there to tip in a miss by Stanley Johnson to pull within 90-88. The Celtics thought Drummond interfered with the ball while it was on the rim and called for a replay, which didn't happen but did get coach Brad Stevens a technical for coming out on the court to argue. Bullock made the foul shot to pull Detroit within a point, but Boston responded again with six straight points. ""I love our fight,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""Like I told the team, we put that type of intensity and fight every night, and that's what we ask, you put yourself in position to win."" TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond and Griffin scored 12 points apiece in the first half. ... The Pistons exercised the club option on the contract of G Luke Kennard through next season. Kennard was inactive Tuesday with a sprained right shoulder. ... Detroit outscored Boston 30-25 in the second quarter and led 58-56 at halftime. ... Griffin picked up his fourth foul with 2:22 left in the third quarter. Celtics: Irving's previous season high was 22 points. ... F Daniel Theis was out with a plantar fascia tear in his right foot. ... Horford was called for a three-second violation twice in the first quarter.","401070780"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard turned in another strong effort at both ends of the floor, and the Raptors responded well after their first loss of the season. Leonard scored 31 points, Pascal Siakam had 15 points and a career-high 15 rebounds, and the Raptors rolled past Philadelphia 129-112 on Tuesday night, handing the 76ers their 12th consecutive defeat north of the border. Kyle Lowry had 20 points and 13 assists, extending his streak of double-digit assist games to a career-best six. ""Nice bounce back,"" Lowry said. ""Good win."" Jonas Valanciunas scored a season-high 23 points and Serge Ibaka had 16 as the Raptors set a season high in points and broke a franchise record with their sixth straight home win to begin the year. Leonard led Toronto with four steals and the Raptors had 13 in all, hounding Philadelphia into a season-worst 23 turnovers. ""It's just his natural instinct for getting his hands on stuff,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Leonard. ""The ball is popping around and boom, he comes out of there with it."" Ben Simmons narrowly missed a triple-double, finishing with 11 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, but also committed 11 turnovers. Asked afterward about Leonard's defensive abilities, Simmons called the Toronto star ""a freak."" ""His hands are huge, he's got long arms,"" Simmons said. ""He's a great defender."" Leonard returned to Toronto's lineup after sitting out Monday's loss at Milwaukee, the second time this season he has been rested in one half of a back-to-back. The two-time Defensive Player of the Year was limited to nine games with San Antonio last season because of a quadriceps injury. Leonard did not speak to reporters after the game because he was lifting weights. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown, who spent more than a decade on San Antonio's staff, said he's not shocked by Leonard's return from the injury. ""To see Kawhi playing basketball at the level that he's playing, it does not surprise me,"" Brown said. Leonard has scored at least 20 in all six games he's played this season. He shot 10-for-19 against Philadelphia and went 9-for-10 at the free throw line. Joel Embiid scored 31 points, Robert Covington had 15 and JJ Redick scored 13 as the 76ers lost for the first time in three games. Philadelphia is 0-4 on the road. ""We just need to get one,"" Simmons said. Philadelphia trailed by as many as 26 in the third quarter before fighting back. Embiid cut the deficit to six, 117-111, on a 3-pointer with 3:29 remaining. After a timeout, Toronto responded with a 7-0 run that was capped by a 3 from Leonard with 1:56 left. Toronto's home winning streak against the Sixers is the second-longest against a single opponent in franchise history, eclipsed only by an active 15-game streak against Minnesota. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid had 11 rebounds. ... Philadelphia had eight turnovers in the first quarter and 14 in the opening half, including seven by Simmons. ""It's borderline impossible to win when you have that many,"" Brown said. ... The Sixers have not won in Toronto since a 93-83 victory on Nov. 10, 2012. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (sprained left big toe) missed his fourth straight game. ... F OG Anunoby (personal reason) was inactive for the third straight game. ... Toronto outscored Philadelphia 27-12 on the fast break. ... Siakam scored a career-best 22 points at Milwaukee on Monday. TOUCH OF GRAY Earlier Tuesday, the 76ers unveiled their new City Edition uniforms for the season. In a release, the team said the gray sweatsuit-textured jersey and shorts were inspired by the training scenes from the Philadelphia-set ""Rocky"" and ""Creed"" movies. CLOSING IN Damon Stoudamire owns the Raptors franchise record with seven consecutive games of 10 or more assists, a mark that Lowry could match in Toronto's next game.

"HOUSTON --  Coach Mike D'Antoni got tired of answering question after question about what's wrong with the Houston Rockets after they were trounced again Tuesday night. ""I can sit up here and talk for the next five minutes, but we're not playing well. That's the bottom line,"" he said. ""And we've got to figure out why and do a better job."" Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic scored 22 points each, and the Portland Trail Blazers never trailed in a 104-85 rout of the struggling Rockets. The Rockets dropped their fourth straight in their second game without James Harden, who is out with a hamstring injury, to fall to 1-5. After entering the season with eyes on a championship, the Rockets have rarely even been competitive, dropping their four home games by an average of more than 17 points. While the Rockets certainly know they need to improve, they're also quick to point out the season is still young. ""We realize that it's early, and if you run off 10 wins in a row or something like that at some point, this would be an afterthought,"" Chris Paul said. Now they face a season-long five-game road trip where they'll likely be without Harden and fellow starter James Ennis (right hamstring) for at least the first game and possibly more. The Rockets are careful not to point fingers and insist everyone must be better to turn things around. ""We're going to figure this out together,"" Carmelo Anthony said. ""It's not one person."" Portland led by double digits most of the night and was up by 23 entering the fourth quarter. Houston got within 15 with about two minutes left, but that was it in front of a crowd which began steadily streaming out midway through the third quarter. CJ McCollum added 19 points for the Trail Blazers, who improved to 5-2 with their second straight victory. Paul led Houston with 17 points and nine assists in his second game back after a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with the Los Angeles Lakers. While getting Harden back will certainly give the Rockets a boost, Houston's problems extend beyond missing last year's MVP. The Rockets have been unable to get into any kind of rhythm on offense and look lost at times on defense. Their 3-pointers aren't falling, and when they get open looks, they seem to miss a lot of those, too. The Rockets made just 10 of 43 3-pointers on a night they shot 32.3 percent overall. D'Antoni insists his team will be good and that it just needs time to gel. But the man known for his fast-paced, high-flying offenses must be scratching his head at how he can get this team on track after such an awful start. The Trail Blazers had a 15-point lead by halftime and used an 11-3 run to open the third quarter and extend it to 62-39. Nurkic had two dunks in that stretch, and Jake Layman capped the run with a 3-pointer. ""That was really good,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""To get a quick lead and jump out on them like that and get it up to 20, rather than give them any life early, I think that was really important."" Anthony made a layup midway through the quarter to cut the lead to 21, but the Trail Blazers scored the next seven points to make it 76-48 about a minute later. The Rockets committed three fouls, missed two free throws and one basket in that stretch. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Nurkic had 10 rebounds. ... Portland made 8 of 20 3-pointers. ... Maurice Harkless sat out with a left knee injury. Rockets: C Nene, who hasn't played this season, remains out indefinitely with a strained right calf strain. ... F Marquese Chriss, who has been inactive all season because of a sprained left ankle, had four points and two rebounds. ... Ennis missed his third straight game with a strained right hamstring. KEEPING IT LIGHT Despite the tough start, D'Antoni hasn't lost his sense of humor and responded with a joke when asked about his team's record. ""We do have 76 games (left). You can ask the analytical guys but mathematically I think we're still in it,"" he said. ""So, we'll figure it out.""","401070782"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The road trip was really long and not very forgiving for the Washington Wizards, all the way through the closing game in Memphis. With Washington on fumes to close out a five-game trip, the Grizzlies used 20 points from Garrett Temple to send the Wizards to their fourth straight loss with a 107-95 victory on Tuesday night. ""We need to get off the road as fast as possible,"" said guard Bradley Beal, who finished with 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley added 19 points apiece for Memphis, Conley also finishing with seven assists. Shelvin Mack scored 14 points as the Grizzlies won their second straight and opened the season 3-0 at home. John Wall led Washington with 22 points, while Kelly Oubre Jr. finished with 16 points and Otto Porter Jr. contributed 15. An 18-1 run by Memphis to open the second half spelled the demise for Washington. Although there were times the Wizards made it interesting, even cutting the Memphis advantage to four points twice before the midway point of the fourth quarter, they could never overtake the Grizzlies. Memphis maintained the lead with 3-point shooting down the stretch, converting four of their first five in the final frame. ""We didn't want to let (the Wizards) get their mojo back against us,"" said Temple, who scored five straight points after Washington got within four points the last time. ""They've been struggling. We wanted to keep it like that and continue this streak that we've built at home."" Both teams shot well from outside the arc: Memphis converting 13 of 28; Washington 14 of 35. Memphis outscored Washington in the paint 44-30. ""We feel like we have guys that can contribute up and down our lineup,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""It's a long season and, at some point in time, everybody is going to get a shot at it."" But the unsuccessful road trip is weighing on the Wizards. There were indications that players are losing patience with each other. ""There's a little frustration,"" Wall said. ""This isn't the point where we wanted to be."" ""It's not pretty. It's not perfect. Everyone is antsy and frustrated, and nobody is more frustrated than we are in this locker room,"" Beal added. Washington coach Scott Brooks agreed that things are tense, but that it's too early to panic. ""We just started seven games ago. We've got 75 more games,"" he said. ""They say it's a marathon, and it is. We all know that if you've been in this league for a long time. It's a grinding season."" TIP-INS Wizards: Starting F Markieff Morris sat out the game while in concussion protocol. Dwight Howard continued to rehab gluteal soreness. ... Washington's five-game road trip stretched over nine days. The five games are the longest stretch of the season away from home. ...

Memphis currently is 22-22 all-time against Philadelphia. ... The 3-0 home start is the third straight year Memphis won its opening three home games. . Kyle Anderson had 11 rebounds. FOR THE DEFENSE Memphis, which entered the game near the top of the league in steals at 9.8, had 16 against the Wizards, including five by Gasol and four by Anderson. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies committed 17 turnovers compared to 20 for the Wizards. Memphis has had fewer turnovers than its opponents in every game this season.","401070783"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley aren't done yet with their long-running feud. Westbrook scored 32 points and had another run-in with Beverley during the Oklahoma City Thunder's 128-110 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night. The Thunder outscored the Clippers 39-10 in the third quarter, and Westbrook and Beverley provided the only drama in the fourth. Beverley dove at a dribbling Westbrook and made contact just above Westbrook's left knee, and both were issued technicals after jawing in front of the benches. Police officers stepped onto the court to help keep the teams separated. Upon review, Beverley's foul was ruled a flagrant 1. There's plenty of history between the two. Westbrook tore the lateral meniscus in his right knee during the playoffs in 2013 when Beverley, then playing for the Houston Rockets, lunged for the ball as Westbrook prepared to call timeout. Westbrook missed the rest of the playoffs and part of the next season. In March 2014, the first time the two played again, Beverley swiped the ball away from Westbrook after a timeout and drew a technical, and Beverley and Westbrook had to be separated. Westbrook has had a history of knee problems. He had a procedure on his right knee that cost him the preseason and the first two games of the regular season. He didn't directly address Beverley's action on Tuesday. ""I have no comment on it,"" Westbrook said. ""I just know that we won."" Beverley felt like he did nothing wrong, and said his reputation plays a role in the calls he gets. ""I feel like I went for a loose ball,"" he said. ""I don't know. I don't know. I went for a loose ball and the ref looked at it on tape and felt like it was a flagrant, and I've got to accept it."" Westbrook was animated throughout the game. On several occasions, he pretended to rock a baby to sleep. Though Westbrook and his wife have twin girls on the way, it turns out the motion wasn't about them. ""Yeah, you got little kids,"" Westbrook said. ""You got to put them to sleep. You got little kids on you, that's what happens. Little guards."" Paul George had 32 points and 12 rebounds, Steven Adams had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder added 15 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City won its second straight after four losses to start the season. Danilo Gallinari led the Clippers with 27 points, but he scored just four in the second half. Lou Williams scored 17 points and Tobias Harris added 15 for Los Angeles. The Clippers shot 55 percent in the first half to take a 67-54 lead. The Thunder opened the second half on an 8-2 run to trim the Clippers' lead to 69-62 before a timeout. Oklahoma City continued the surge, and a 3-pointer by Jerami Grant finally gave the Thunder a 70-69 lead. Oklahoma City extended the run to 23-2 and took a 77-69 lead. The Thunder led 93-77 at the end of the third quarter. They shot 70 from the field in the period while holding Los Angeles to 24 percent shooting. TIP-INS Clippers: Defeated the Thunder 108-92 on Nov. 19. ... Gallinari was called for a technical in the first quarter, and Marcin Gortat and Avery Bradley were called for techs in the second quarter. ... Mike Scott hit a 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer.

"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie and his teammates are trying to change the perception of the Brooklyn Nets. That is why what transpired at Barclays Center on Wednesday night was so important to the fourth-year guard. ""Because of what we're fighting for. We're trying to be a good team and trying the change the tide of the Nets' teams in the past. You got to know how to get out of rut fast,"" Dinwiddie said after making a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left in overtime to help the Brooklyn Nets beat the Detroit Pistons 120-119. ""(Losses) can string together and it can affect morale and all that other stuff,"" Dinwiddie said. Dinwiddie finished with a season-high 25 points. He was 8 of 15 from the field, including 5 for 9 from 3. Four of his five 3s came in the fourth quarter or overtime. ""I was able to hit a couple shots and help our team win,"" Dinwiddie said. Joe Harris added a season high 23 points, Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen had 19 each, and Jared Dudley finished with 11. The Nets snapped a three-game losing streak to improve to 3-5. ""We've been in this experience a lot,"" Harris said. ""A lot of close (games) last year. A lot of close games to start the season. For us to close one out (and) execute down the stretch-take care of the ball and execute defensively-this is huge in terms of confidence for us and (this is) just a big morale boost whenever you get a win like this."" The Pistons have dropped three straight to fall to 4-3. ""When we were 4-0 nobody was cheering for us and nobody is going to feel sorry for us when we lose three in a row,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We're in a situation where we have each other. We have to pull together and take care of the mental mistakes we're making, and I have to make sure we're getting better shots for our guys where we can execute better offensively."" Blake Griffin led Detroit with 25 points, Andre Drummond had 24 points and 23 rebounds, and Reggie Jackson scored 21 points. After Dinwiddie's late 3-pointer, Griffin missed a fadeaway. ""We just have to lock in,"" said Griffin. ""It's just an effort thing or a concentration thing."" The Nets trailed by as much as 10 in the third quarter, and entered the fourth down 83-77. Brooklyn ended up outscoring the Pistons 33-27 in the fourth quarter, with Dinwiddie hitting a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left to force overtime. ""Thank God for Spencer Dinwiddie,"" Dudley said. TIP-INS: Pistons: Reserve Jose Calderon's 3-pointer with a second left in the first half gave Detroit a 60-54 lead. Calderon finished with eight points, two rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot. Nets: In his second game of the season, Nets power forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had eight points and seven rebounds while playing a reserve role. Backup big man Ed Davis had with 10 points and 10 rebounds. NOT PASSING THE BOARDS During his pregame press conference, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson bemoaned his team's performance on the glass in a 115-96 loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night. In the loss to their crosstown rivals, the Nets were out rebounded 53-32. And Atkinson focused on his guards, who combined for eight rebounds. ""A lot of times our bigs are locked in or boxing out a big, and our guards are not pursuing the ball like they should."" Against the Pistons, Nets guards had 18 rebounds. MIDDLE OF THE ROAD Historically, defense and the Detroit Pistons have been synonymous terms. Through seven games of the Casey Era, Detroit is in the middle of the pack defensively, allowing 111.3 points per game. Offensively, they entered the game scoring 109.7 points per game. ""In today's NBA, scoring is at a premium,"" Casey said before the game. ""The pace is way up. Teams attempting the 3 is way up, so I would say scoring offensively is huge.""","401070785"
"NEW YORK --  After walking into Madison Square Garden dressed as a superhero, Victor Oladipo had to shake off his lingering bronchitis before unleashing his powers on the New York Knicks. Domantas Sabonis was 12-for-12 shooting while matching his career high with 30 points, Oladipo scored 11 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and the Indiana Pacers beat the Knicks 107-101 on Wednesday night. Oladipo, who arrived in a Black Panther costume for Halloween, has been dealing with bronchitis for about a week, and it worsened two days ago. He started off cold Wednesday, scoring five points and picking up three fouls in the first half while feeling short of breath at times. It was all different down the stretch. Indiana trailed 97-94 with 3:08 left before Oladipo got hot. Sabonis hit two free throws, and then Oladipo picked off Tim Hardaway Jr.'s lazy dribble and threw down a breakaway dunk for a 98-97 lead. Indiana scored the next five points, capped by Oladipo's 3-pointer with 1:23 left, to make it 103-97 after the star guard had hit just one of his previous seven 3s. ""Some of the shots I feel like I normally make I wasn't making today,"" Oladipo said. ""So got to find other ways to win, got other ways to impact the game."" Hardaway led the Knicks with 37 points, and Noah Vonleh had 14 points and 10 rebounds. New York has lost six of seven since winning on opening night. Their inability to execute several times coming out of timeouts cost them in the fourth quarter on top of the five turnovers that Indiana converted into eight points. ""Coming out of the timeout we gotta know our plays. We know how the defensive concepts are,"" said Hardaway Jr., who had a career-high seven 3s. ""It is youth, it comes with that."" After Thaddeus Young's hook shot made it 100-97, Knicks coach David Fizdale gathered his group with 1:55 remaining. New York's youthfulness caught up as some of the players weren't aware where they needed to be before Hardaway misfired on a 3-point attempt which led to a 3 from Oladipo to put Indiana up by six. Alonzo Trier's basket cut New York's deficit to 103-101 with 44 seconds left. Indiana called a timeout and almost gave New York the ball back when Bogdan Bogdanovic missed an open 3, but Young recovered the offensive rebound and found Oladipo open in front of the Knicks bench for a 3-pointer. ""Thad stayed alert, got the ball to Victor, and Victor found a rhythm that second half,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Nothing was falling for him early but he stayed with it and made some big shots going down the stretch."" Young had 13 points, 10 rebounds and five steals. BACK IN New York native and former Knicks player Kyle O'Quinn got a nice hand from the Madison Square Garden crowd when he entered late in the second quarter. O'Quinn signed a one-year deal with Indiana after opting out of the final year of his contract in New York. His decision landed him $4.5 million, a $200,000 raise. ""You talk to your agent, you talk to your family, but you have to make it,"" O'Quinn said before the nationally televised game. ""It's the biggest decision I've ever made as far as making a choice in my career. I slept on it, prayed on it.

"CHICAGO --  Paul Millsap knows nobody is perfect in the NBA. The key to being a good team is finding ways to win when not everything is clicking. The 13-year veteran believes that's exactly what the Denver Nuggets did Wednesday night. Nikola Jokic had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Millsap's putback with 0.1 seconds left in overtime gave the Nuggets a 108-107 victory against the Chicago Bulls. Trailing by a point, Denver inbounded the ball with 3.5 seconds remaining. Jokic missed, but Millsap grabbed the rebound and converted a layup off the glass for the winning basket as the Nuggets improved to 6-1. ""All games are not going to be pretty,"" Millsap said. ""You're not going to shoot the lights out all the time, but the way that we're winning games is something special, especially with young guys. ""They're learning how to win without making shots."" Zach LaVine had 28 points and rookie Wendell Carter Jr. scored a career-high 25 for Chicago. LaVine has at least 20 points in a career-best nine straight games, a streak that dates back to last season. It was Carter's second consecutive game establishing a new high. He had 18 points Monday against the Golden State Warriors. ""We have to learn how to win,"" LaVine said. ""We brought it all the way down to the wire, but we fought. It was a bounce back. Still (stinks), though. You play such a good game, you want that result."" After the Nuggets took a 106-104 lead on a 3-pointer by Jokic -- he had eight of Denver's 10 points in overtime -- Justin Holiday answered with a 3 to put Chicago on top 107-106 with 1:26 to play. After giving up 92 first-half points to Golden State on Monday, the Bulls allowed just 51 in the first two quarters but still trailed by three at halftime. Chicago held a 96-90 edge with three minutes left before Denver went on an 8-2 spurt to tie it at 98 with 1:07 left. ""I reminded our guys about the opening night in LA,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We were down six or eight and we never panicked. I said, `Tonight, we're not going to panic, either."" Neither team could convert multiple opportunities in the final minute, sending the game to overtime. KEEP SHOOTING Jokic had nine assists to finish one shy of a triple-double, but was having an off shooting night until the final minutes of regulation and overtime. He made his first three shots in OT -- including a pair of 3-pointers -- before the miss Millsap converted. ""It was unbelievable to see him flip the switch like that, to go from struggling to knocking down 3s in big moments,"" Millsap said. ""He's a special player."" REUNION Denver G Monte Morris played two years under Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg at Iowa State. When Hoiberg made the jump to Chicago in 2016, Morris recalled his former coach told him he'd see him in the NBA. Morris, selected by the Nuggets in the second round (51st overall) of the 2017 draft, was far from a can't-miss prospect. ""You knew he was going to find a way to make it in this league,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's one of the smartest players, highest IQs, I've ever been around."" TIP-INS Nuggets: The team announced Tuesday it picked up next season's option on the rookie-scale contracts of 2016 first-round draft picks Jamal Murray, Juan Hernangomez and Malik Beasley.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  As the final buzzer sounded and his teammates swarmed him on the court, Derrick Rose couldn't help but fight back tears. Rose's emotions were on full display moments after he scored a career-high 50 points in a vintage performance that lifted the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Utah Jazz 128-125 on Wednesday. Given everything he's been through, it was a special night for the 2011 NBA MVP. ""It still didn't even hit me yet,"" he said. ""Words can't explain how I feel right now. It's been a while."" Derailed by injuries for years, Rose walked off serenaded by chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" from the home crowd. The 30-year-old point guard shot 19 of 31 from the field and hit four 3-pointers. He played 41 minutes, his most in nearly two years. ""He has courage, he has humility and he has character,"" said Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who also coached Rose during his prime seasons in Chicago. ""He's been through a lot of adversity. He's maybe one of the most mentally tough people I've ever come across."" Rose had 34 points in the second half and 15 in a tightly contested fourth quarter as the Wolves held off the Jazz, who waived Rose in February after a two-day stint. His basket down low with 30 seconds remaining put Minnesota up for good, and he made two free throws with 13.8 seconds left to make it a three-point lead. ""He made a lot of plays, made some tough shots,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We had some breakdowns, a little bit of everything."" Jae Crowder and Joe Ingles each missed a 3-pointer that could have tied it for Utah. Rose then blocked a 3-point try by Dante Exum with 2.7 seconds to go, and the Timberwolves grabbed the loose ball to seal it. Back in the locker room, excited teammates doused Rose in celebration. One of his biggest shots was a corner 3 that tied the game at 119. That gave him 44 points, which matched his previous high set during the 2011 playoffs with the Bulls. His regular-season best had been 42 points. Rose tied it at 110 with one of his patented layups, giving him 41 points. He weaved through traffic and made the off-balance shot, showing glimpses of the moves that once made him an elite player and the top pick in the 2008 draft. ""He was feeling great and when you start feeling great you get some extra energy, you get some extra adrenaline and you make amazing plays and that's what he did the whole game,"" Utah center Rudy Gobert said. Making his first start of the season, Rose scored 19 points in the third quarter as the Timberwolves took a five-point lead into the fourth. Karl-Anthony Towns added nine of his 28 points in the period. Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points and Gobert added 22 for Utah. Crowder provided 18 points off the bench. Mitchell did not play in the final 4:22 because of right hamstring tightness and will be re-evaluated Thursday. The Wolves put the Jazz on the free throw line plenty in the fourth quarter. After 11 attempts through three periods, Utah was 13 of 19 from the line in the fourth. Minnesota played without All-Star Jimmy Butler, as well as point guards Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones. Butler sat out with what the team described as ""general soreness."" Butler, who has been the main story line in Minnesota for much of the early season due to his trade request, reportedly plans to play Friday at Golden State. The Timberwolves got Andrew Wiggins back after he missed three games with a quadriceps injury. Wiggins had missed just one total game in his first four seasons before his recent setback. He scored 19 points on 8-of-17 shooting. TIP-INS Jazz: G Alec Burks (left hand sprain) did not play. Burks also did not play Sunday at Dallas. ... Utah is 4-1 on the road this season and 0-2 at home. ... Gobert had his third straight game with 20-plus points and 10-plus rebounds. Timberwolves: Thibodeau said Teague underwent an MRI but was awaiting more tests. Teague is day-to-day. ... Jones was a late scratch with right foot soreness he experienced during warmups. ... The Wolves debuted their ""Classic Edition"" jerseys, a throwback to the uniforms the team wore from 1996-2008.","401070788"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Steve Kerr scratched of his head when asked why Stephen Curry is shooting the ball so well at the start of his 10th NBA season. ""It's, um, I don't know,"" Kerr said. No question Golden State's coach is getting a thrill watching No. 30's hot hand -- as in 52.9 percent from 3-point range through nine games. Curry scored 37 points with seven 3-pointers for his sixth 30-point game of the season and dished out nine assists, and the Warriors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 131-121 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight win. ""I've always said I want to continue to try to improve my shooting and get more efficient,"" Curry said. ""Obviously a good start to that but got to sustain it and stick to the program of what I've been doing."" Kevin Durant added 24 points and eight assists, and Draymond Green contributed 16 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists for his first double-double of the season. Green has 50 assists in the last five games and is a big reason the Warriors are passing so well this season. They finished with a season-high 39 assists. ""Probably the best player on the floor tonight,"" Kerr said of Green. ""... We are only as good as Draymond is on many nights."" Anthony Davis returned from a two-game absence with a sprained right elbow and shot just 6 of 16 for 17 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for the Pelicans, who lost a five-game Western Conference semifinal to Golden State last postseason. ""I thought he was a little winded,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They weren't going to let him catch the ball and go one-on-one against anybody down there."" Klay Thompson scored 18 points with one 3-pointer for the Warriors two days after setting an NBA record with 14 3s and scoring 52 in a blowout road win against the Bulls. Curry scored 16 points in the third quarter with four 3s. He wound up 12 for 20 and 7 of 11 from deep. Two-time defending champion Golden State's lone loss came in the third game of the season by two points at Denver on Oct. 21. Jrue Holiday had 28 points and nine assists while Nikola Mirotic added 26 points and 12 rebounds for New Orleans, which has a quick turnaround playing at Portland on Thursday night. The Pelicans lost their third straight. The Warriors had 12 assists on 16 baskets with five 3-pointers in their 43-point first quarter. MOMENT OF SILENCE A moment of silence was held before the game for San Francisco Giants Hall of Famer Willie McCovey, who died Wednesday at age 80. ""For me, Willie McCovey represents a major figure from my childhood,"" said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who grew up a Dodgers fan. ""Hearing Vin Scully talking about Willie McCovey and the Dodger/Giant rivalry. I'm well aware of how beloved Willie was here in the Bay Area and by the Giants family. We extend our condolences to Willie's family and to the Giants family. Everybody here with the Warriors is thinking about them tonight."" LET'S GET TROPICAL! During his sharp-shooting barrage against Chicago, Thompson was forced to wear a large yellow headband over a cut on his forehead, and he joked after the game he looked like Jackie Moon, Will Ferrell's character from the movie ""Semi-Pro."" Thompson then arrived to the arena Wednesday dressed as Moon in a Flint Tropics jersey for Halloween. TIP-INS Pelicans: The Pelicans were outrebounded 46-42. ... Elfrid Payton missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... New Orleans lost each of its previous two games scoring 111 points, against Utah and Denver. ...

Warriors: Reserve G Shaun Livingston missed his third straight game with soreness in his right foot. The MRI was clear, coach Steve Kerr said, ""but we are going to be very careful with Shaun."" Kerr also plans to take every precaution with fellow veteran Andre Iguodala because ""we want both guys to be fresh and ready to roll for the playoffs."" ... Three Golden State starters had two fouls by early in the second quarter -- Curry, Green and Damian Jones. ... The Warriors played at home on Halloween for the first time since hosting Phoenix on Oct. 31, 2000.","401070789"
"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James walked into Staples Center on Halloween dressed as Jason from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. Five hours later, he saved the Los Angeles Lakers from a horrifying ending. The four-time MVP scored 29 points and made the game-winning free throw with 2.1 seconds left Wednesday night as the Lakers held on for a 114-113 win over the Dallas Mavericks. ""I don't like the way we closed out the game, but for the majority of the game we played well,"" James said. Los Angeles led nearly throughout and was up 111-98 with 3:42 to go before the Mavericks went on a 15-2 run to pull even. Luka Doncic tied it at 113 with 7.2 seconds remaining on a jumper from the corner, but on the next trip down the floor James was fouled by Wesley Mathews while shooting a jump shot. James missed the first free throw but made the second. J.J. Barea missed a 3-pointer for Dallas as time expired, and the Lakers (3-5) stopped a two-game skid. ""NBA games are never over and you have to play the game a certain way,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""If you mess with the game, the game will mess with you and I thought we did that a little bit. Hopefully we can learn the same lesson even if it was a win."" JaVale McGee added 16 points and 15 rebounds, Kyle Kuzma scored 18 and Brandon Ingram had 17 for the Lakers. Matthews led Dallas with 21 points and Harrison Barnes scored 19. The Mavericks (2-6) have lost five straight. ""I love the fight. Our first quarter was very disappointing but we battled back,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We were able to get stops in the fourth quarter and we were getting some momentum on offense."" The Lakers scored the first eight points and led by 18 in the first quarter as they went 15 of 23 from the field and made six 3-pointers. Dallas trimmed the margin to 66-59 by halftime. Matthews' driving bank shot pulled the Mavericks to 70-64 before the Lakers went on a 17-4 run -- which included 10 points by James -- to open their largest lead at 87-68 with 4:40 remaining in the third. The closest the Mavericks got in the first eight minutes of the fourth was 98-90 with 8:12 left. ROAD WOES The Mavericks, who dropped to 0-5 on the road, are one of seven teams in the NBA without a win away from home. They have lost 10 straight road games dating back to last season. TOUGH START, BETTER FINISH Doncic, the second pick in the 2018 draft, said before the game that he grew up idolizing James. The teenager from Slovenia, who scored 31 points Monday night at San Antonio and is averaging 20.4 points per game, might have been in awe a bit during his first game against James as he missed his first six shots. Doncic was able to shake off the slow start, though, as he made his final five shots from the field and finished with 14 points. James gave Doncic his jersey after the game. TALE OF TWO HALVES The Lakers held the Mavericks to 37 percent from the floor in the first and third quarters (17 of 46), but Dallas shot 65 percent (26 of 40) in the second and fourth. ""The first and third quarters defensively we were pretty good and then we had two awful quarters. It is just about getting better with those things,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Mavericks: DeAndre Jordan had 12 rebounds and 10 points. ... Barea (15 points) and Dwight Powell (12) came off the bench to score in double figures. ... The Mavericks were 14 of 19 from the field in the second quarter. ... G Devin Harris (left hamstring strain) missed his seventh straight game. Lakers: Have won three straight against the Mavericks. ...

The last Lakers player to accomplish that was Pau Gasol on Jan. 20, 2014, at Chicago. ... Kuzma scored 11 points in the first quarter. ... The 38 points were a season high for a first quarter. ... F Michael Beasley missed his second straight game due to personal reasons.","401070790"
"PHOENIX --  DeMar DeRozan and coach Gregg Popovich had a talk before Wednesday night's game about DeRozan's playing time this season. The hope was DeRozan could get a bit more rest. It worked out just right for DeRozan, Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs in their 120-90 win over the Phoenix Suns. DeRozan scored 20 of his 25 points in the first half, LaMarcus Aldridge added 24 points and the Spurs routed the Suns for their third straight victory. DeRozan and Aldridge, Nos. 1 and 2 in the NBA in minutes per game going in, sat out the entire fourth quarter with the Spurs comfortably ahead. ""That was big,"" said DeRozan, who was averaging 38.9 minutes per game. ""That was one thing that was on my mind today. To go out there and do what we're supposed to do so we'd be able to rest."" The Spurs led by 31 during the second quarter en route to a fifth straight win over Phoenix. Aldridge scored 16 points in the third. He and DeRozan combined to make 20 of 25 shots. ""It's always nice to get some rest,"" Aldridge said. ""I thought guys came in focused from the beginning. It's always nice when your shots go in. DeMar started out hot and I got it going in the third, and that always makes it easy for us."" The Suns have lost six straight and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers and Washington Wizards at 1-6, tied for the NBA's worst. T.J. Warren, in his first start of the season, led Phoenix with 21 points. Suns rookie Mikal Bridges added a career-best 16 points. ""The final score is basically saying a lot where we're at as a team,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. The Spurs closed out the first quarter on a 15-2 run after the game was tied at 13. San Antonio went up 40-22 on DeRozan's fastbreak dunk with 7:34 left in the first half. DeRozan made 8 of 10 shots in the first half, many on drives to the basket. The Spurs made 24 of 41 shots in the first half and turned the game into a blowout with the Suns struggling on the offensive end. San Antonio stayed hot, making 55.4 percent of its shots. Marco Belinelli's fadeaway 3-pointer with 2:12 left in the first half made the score 60-29. The Spurs led by 32 points during the fourth quarter. The Suns scored the final 10 points of the first half to trail by 21 at the break. ""We're going to come back and we're going to learn and watch some film and get better,"" Bridges said. ""Just playing as a team, going out there and just fighting."" TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio will be back in Phoenix in two weeks for the second meeting of the season between the two teams. ... DeRozan has led the Spurs in scoring in six of their seven games. ... F Rudy Gay came up hobbling after missing a layup late in the third quarter, but shook it off and remained in the game. Suns: Phoenix played its third straight game without star guard Devin Booker, who is still dealing with a hamstring strain. ... G Isaiah Canaan (left ankle strain) was held out. ... G Josh Jackson played despite a bruised left toe. ... The Suns are 8-10 on Halloween. EXCUSE ME Aldridge inadvertently tipped up a pass from DeRozan, and the ball dropped into the net for two points with 8:56 left in the third quarter. The two shared a smile as they headed back on defense. YOUNG SUNS RUNNING POINT With Canaan out, the Suns began the game with rookie Elie Okobo at point guard making his first career start. Backing him up was another rookie, De'Anthony Melton, who had been inactive for the past three games. Melton played a season high 20 minutes.","401070791"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  James Borrego wasn't upset Russell Westbrook put up 29 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds against his team Thursday night. He expected that from the seven-time All-Star. What bothered Charlotte's first-year coach is that Alex Abrines had 25 points on five 3-pointers and Dennis Schroder was able to get to the rim effectively and add 21 more, helping the Oklahoma Thunder overcame a 19-point deficit to beat Borrego's Hornets 111-107 for their third straight win. Borrego called it ""game plan errors."" Paul George had a different explanation: that's just the way Westbrook impacts games. He called the seven-time All-Star ""one of the baddest dudes in the league."" Abrines deflected praise for his big game to Westbrook, saying all he had to do was make open shots. ""The defense has two options -- come in and help and leave me open or stay attached to me and (Westbrook) is going to get layups,"" Abrines said. ""Sometimes you just stay in the corner and wait for the pass to come."" ""Alex has to be ready to shoot the ball, he's a shooter and he knows how to play the game of basketball,"" Westbrook said. Westbrook did his part, hurting the Hornets in transition, with pull-up jumpers and in pick and rolls, a few of which resulted in highlight reel dunks. He also helped limit Kemba Walker to 21 points. The Thunder made a concerted effort to slow down Walker, who came in averaging 30 points per game. Walker failed to make a field goal before the break and had just three points, although the Hornets still led 48-44 at halftime. Walker came to life in the third with 10 straight points to help the Hornets push their lead to 19. Westbrook led the Thunder back. With 1:12 left, he drove and found an open Dennis Schroder with a crosscourt pass for an open 3-pointer. After a Charlotte miss, Westbrook used a screen from Steven Adams to get by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for a layup to push the lead to 108-102. Westbrook punctuated the win with a ferocious dunk with 13 seconds left off a fast break before stopping to glare at the crowd. TIP INS Thunder: Were 8 of 37 from 3-point range. Hornets: Charlotte entered with 104 3-pointers, tied for the second most ever through eight games behind last season's Golden State Warriors (107). ... Marvin Williams now has 500 career blocks. ... Tony Parker went down hard on his left elbow but remained in the game. Borrego said he is fine. GEORGE'S DEAD FOOT George had a rough night, shooting 4 of 20 from the field and finishing with 11 points. After the game, George revealed he's been dealing with a peroneal nerve palsy or ""dead foot."" ""I am just trying to play through that,"" George said. ""It's nothing major or that is going to hurt me. It's just something that is going to come back when it feels right."" STRATEGY ON WALKER Thunder coach Billy Donovan joked he wasn't giving away his strategy for slowing down Walker in the first half since they have to play the Hornets again. ""It was a collective team effort and we did a really good job,"" Donovan said. ""You have to do a good job in pick and roll coverage and you have to be persistent because he's really shifty. He looks like he is giving up on the play and you bail out and there he goes."" Said Walker: ""They were blitzing me the whole game, so I kind of got a few of my baskets early in the third in transition. But yeah everyone is switching now, but for the most part in the pick and roll they were blitzing me."" WESTBROOK'S TECH Westbrook got a technical foul early for screaming ""and one"" after a driving layup after the foul wasn't called. He appeared not to like the call very much because on the next possession he split two Charlotte defenders and threw down a dunk.","401070792"
"CLEVELAND --  The Denver Nuggets aren't getting too excited about their early season success. Denver moved to 7-1 with a 110-91 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, the Nuggets' best start since going 8-0 in 1976-77. The Nuggets are keeping their feet on the ground despite having the second-most wins in the NBA. ""I love the 7-1 start, but it doesn't mean a lot to me, to be honest,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""For us, the only real success will be measured in the postseason."" Juancho Hernangomez scored 23 points and Paul Millsap added 16 to lead six players in double figures. The Nuggets won their third straight. On Wednesday night in Chicago, they beat the Bulls 108-107 in overtime on Millsap's put-back with 0.1 seconds left. Millsap, in his 13th season, is not only being productive, but he's also a veteran voice in the locker room. ""We can't be content,"" he said. ""We can't be complacent. We just want to stay in the moment."" Jordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 17 points, and Cedi Osman added 13. Collin Sexton, the No. 8 overall pick, had 12 points. The Cavaliers dropped to 1-7. They have split two games under ""acting"" coach Larry Drew. Denver shot 6 for 17 in the first quarter and fell behind 29-17. After cutting it to 38-34, the Nuggets finished the second period on 16-4 run that included 13 straight points. Millsap had a simple explanation for the first quarter. ""At the start, we were shaking off some of the rust, I guess,"" he said. Asked what happened on Cleveland's end, Drew chuckled and said, ""That's a good question. We made bad decisions, we turned the basketball over, we couldn't make shots and our defense let us down."" Hernangomez had 12 points in the quarter, including three 3-pointers. The backup forward came into the game with 22 points for the season and didn't get off the bench Wednesday. ""Juancho was the best player on the floor for long stretches,"" Malone said. ""You've got to give a lot of credit to him."" Denver led 50-42 at halftime and dominated the second half. The Nuggets' biggest lead was 26 points at 106-76. The Nuggets won going away despite an off-night from leading scorer Nikola Jokic, who had averaged 21.6 points. The 7-footer scored four points in 22 minutes and didn't play in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers had another busy day off the court. Drew said contract negotiations with the team are going in a positive direction. Drew replaced Tyronn Lue, who was fired Sunday, but wants the Cavs to restructure his contract if he's going to become the team's interim coach. Guard J.R. Smith said he wants to be traded after being dropped from the rotation. The 15-year veteran has played in four of Cleveland's eight games. A few fans began a ""We want J.R."" chant as Denver built the lead in the second half. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced Thursday that the Cavaliers have been awarded the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. The game will be a cornerstone event during the league's 75th anniversary. IT'S NOT EASY The Cavaliers knew the transition without LeBron James would be difficult when he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers after leading Cleveland to four straight Finals and a championship in 2016. Forward Kevin Love is out indefinitely with a left foot injury, making matters more complicated. ""With LeBron leaving we take on a whole new identity,"" Drew said. ""We have no Kevin Love. We're trying to find out ways to score. We're trying to find out ways to play without Kevin and we have to find it out really quick."" STILL AILING Nuggets G Isaiah Thomas has yet to appear in a game after undergoing hip surgery in March. Cleveland acquired Thomas from Boston for All-Star G Kyrie Irving prior to last season, but he didn't play until January because of the hip injury. Thomas played in only 15 games with the Cavaliers before being dealt to the Lakers. He signed with the Nuggets in July.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid wants to be the NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year this season. He is off to a solid start. Embiid had 41 points and 13 rebounds, helping the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 122-113 on Thursday night. It was Embiid's sixth game already this season with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. Philadelphia fans rained down ""MVP! MVP!"" chants on the big man. ""It's great,"" Embiid said. ""It's just about being aggressive and staying within the concepts of the system."" Ben Simmons added 14 points and 11 assists, bouncing back nicely from one of his worst games as a pro. Markelle Fultz provided a spark late in the third quarter and finished with 12 points, nine rebounds and five assists while helping Philadelphia improve to 5-0 at home. But it was Embiid leading the way for the Sixers. ""He's tough, he's skilled, he can shoot, he basically can do everything,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Philadelphia led by as many as 11 in the final quarter on Embiid's follow dunk, but the advantage was just three with 6:16 remaining. Embiid then scored nine of the next 12 points, including an emphatic dunk over Boban Marjanovic with 1:39 remaining that gave Philadelphia a 117-109 lead. ""He was just dominant,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Lou Williams scored 26 points for the Clippers, and Danilo Gallinari had 25. Tobias Harris finished with 24 points. ""We didn't execute (down the stretch) and had bad shot selection,"" Rivers said. ""That can't happen."" The Clippers trailed by as many as 22 points in the opening half and were down 72-57 entering the third quarter. But Los Angeles slowly chipped away at the deficit, going in front for the first time on Gallinari's 3-pointer from the right wing that made it 81-80 with 3:58 left in the period. Another Gallinari 3 put the Clippers up 84-80 before Fultz showed flashes of why Philadelphia drafted him first overall in 2017. Fultz scored on a goaltending call, and then assisted on Mike Muscala's four-point play before converting consecutive coast-to-coast layups, helping the 76ers end the quarter on a 10-2 run that put them ahead 90-86 entering the fourth. ""He had a huge influence,"" Rivers said. ""He might have been the change of the game."" Said Brown: ""We continue to see why he was drafted (No. 1). He's really gifted with the ball as a point guard."" BETTER BEN After tying his career high with 11 turnovers in Tuesday's 119-112 loss at Toronto, Simmons had just two turnovers against Los Angeles.

"ATLANTA --  De'Aaron Fox's teammates made sure he knew he was close to his first career triple-double. Fox reached the milestone in a rout inspired by a similarly lopsided loss in Sacramento's last visit to Atlanta. Fox set career highs with 31 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Kings beat the Hawks 146-115 on Thursday night for their fifth straight win. Fox didn't have to look at the scoreboard to know he was approaching the triple-double. ""They told me,"" Fox said of his teammates. ""It was like, `Go get it."" Fox's 10th rebound completed the memorable achievement. The second-year guard's previous career highs were 16 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. The Hawks had no answer for Fox's quickness and shooting. He went 3 for 4 from 3-point range. ""Fox is one of the, if not the, fastest guys in the league,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""He's got a different motor. He sets the pace for them at all times. When he's hitting 3s, he's hard to stop."" Fox and the Kings did not forget an ugly 126-80 loss at Atlanta on Nov. 15, 2017, that was the Hawks' most lopsided win in franchise history. ""This was a game that maybe meant a little more,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Even so, Joerger said he wasn't expecting to win by 31 points. ""Nobody saw this coming,"" he said. Last season's Kings-Hawks game was a matchup of last-place teams. The Kings showed the Hawks the difference one season can make. ""They went through struggles last year and you see what they're able to do now,"" Hawks rookie point guard Trae Young said. ""Of course, you never want to lose like this."" Buddy Hield scored 27 points and Nemanja Bjelica had 19 for the Kings (6-3), whose winning streak includes four straight against Eastern Conference teams, including the last three on the road. The Kings averaged 110.8 points over the first four games of the streak. They moved past that number with a full period remaining, carrying a 115-87 lead into the final quarter. After leading by only five points at halftime, the Kings outscored the Hawks 46-23 in the third. Fox had 21 points in the period. Sacramento maintained its up-tempo pressure in the final period.

The Hawks made 60.5 percent of their first-half shots (23 of 38), easily a season-best performance. They finished at 48.3 percent. SLOW START Young recovered from a slow start to post a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists. He had four turnovers with two points in the first period and finished with eight of the Hawks' 22 turnovers. HUERTER HURT Pierce said there was no word on the severity of the sprained right ankle for guard Kevin Huerter, who left with 4:27 remaining in the first period. The rookie limped off the court after Hield crashed into the back of his leg while diving for a loose ball.","401070795"
"Gordon Hayward describes a play in the first half against the Bucks, when he landed on his left foot and was sore afterward. (0:46) BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics went outside and stayed there while knocking off the last of the NBA's unbeatens with a barrage of 3-pointers. The Celtics set a franchise record for 3-pointers with 24 in a 117-113 win over the Bucks on Thursday night, handing Milwaukee its first loss of the season. ""We got a lot of open looks. We were taking what they were giving us,"" said Gordon Hayward, who hit three 3-pointers while scoring a season-high 18. ""Those are big shots for us. We have to be able to hit those."" Kyrie Irving led Boston with 28 points, including six 3-pointers as the Celtics shattered the club record of 19 and came up one short of the NBA record. Al Horford also scored 18, hitting four from beyond-the-arc, and Marcus Morris made five 3-pointers to finish with 17 points. ""It was probably a little more than we wanted to shoot, but those were the shots that were there,"" said Horford, who also led the Celtics with eight assists. ""We definitely want to be better, but we did a good job. I just felt like we moved the ball well. That was encouraging to see."" Giannis Antetokounmpo returned to the lineup after missing one game while in the NBA's concussion protocol and led Milwaukee with 33 points and 11 rebounds. Antetokounmpo helped lead the Bucks to a 62-22 advantage in points-in-the-paint, but it wasn't quite enough for Milwaukee to overcome Boston's outside shooting. ""We were all shooting really well,"" Morris said. ""We were just knocking them down and our guys got hot."" Milwaukee, the last unbeaten team left in the NBA after beating Toronto on Monday night, came up just short after a furious rally in the fourth quarter. Down 15 entering the final period, the Bucks opened on a 12-0 run and were within a point in the final minute, but the Celtics held on for their fourth straight win. ""We still think we are one of the best teams,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Tonight we didn't have an `A' or `B' game. Probably a `C' game, but we were still close to winning the game in Boston."" Khris Middleton and Malcom Brogdon scored 16 apiece and Eric Bledsoe had 13 points and seven assists for the Bucks. The Celtics, whose previous record for 3-pointers was 19, came one short of tying the NBA record of 25, set by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a win over the Atlanta Hawks on March 4. Boston didn't score in the fourth until Jayson Tatum hit a 3-pointer with 9:13 left in the game. Milwaukee continued to push and pulled within 113-112 when Bledsoe made 1 of 2 from the foul line with 13 seconds. That was as close as the Bucks would get as the Celtics sealed it from the foul line. Irving hit back-to-back 3-pointers late in the second quarter and Boston led 55-53 at halftime. He opened the second half with three straight from beyond-the-arc and the Celtics appeared to be cruising with a 93-78 lead entering the fourth quarter. ""We can get better. We can play better, but credit to Boston tonight,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. COMING ALONG Hayward's previous season-high was 15. Thursday was actually his highest-scoring game as a member of the Celtics, missing last season after a gruesome ankle injury in the opening game. Hayward had a scare in the first half when he came down hard on the left ankle, but was able to finish. ""I think I got off to a good start and that was important for me. It felt good being able to be out there at the end of the game, too,"" Hayward said. ""It's an ongoing process. Last game wasn't that great. Tonight was a little bit better."" ALL HAIL! There was an extended time out midway through the first quarter, when Red Sox manager Alex Cora carried the World Series championship trophy onto the court, followed by his players. Fans roared when Cora led the team out of the tunnel and got louder each time a player hoisted the trophy high for the fans to continue a celebration that started Sunday with a series-clinching victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. To punctuate the visit, fans broke out in a round of their favorite derogatory chant about the rival New York Yankees. TIP INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo returned to practice Wednesday and was cleared to play Thursday. He was injured Saturday by a blow to the head during in a game against Orlando. Antetokounmpo said it was his first concussion. Celtics: Boston's previous franchise record for 3-pointers was 19, done twice, most recently Jan. 16 in a win over New Orleans. . G Jaylen Brown was out with a sore right foot. . Semi Ojeleye, who played all of 24 minutes and scored two points through the first seven games, started for Brown and scored 10 points.","401070796"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  While the Trail Blazers found it easy to score against the Pelicans, in the end it was their defense -- and some stops in the fourth quarter -- that helped Portland pull away. Damian Lillard scored 26 points to help Portland beat New Orleans 132-119 on Thursday night in the first meeting between the teams since the Pelicans swept the Trail Blazers in the first round of last season's playoffs. Jusuf Nurkic added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Blazers, who made 18 3-pointers in their third straight win. New Orleans, hurt by the absence of star Anthony Davis, dropped its fourth consecutive game. The Pelicans were the sixth seed last season when they upset the third-seeded Blazers in the playoffs. ""Tonight we came out and it was easy on offense, so it seemed like we kind of just fell into that trap, where we're going to be able to score and hoping they miss instead of going out there and making them miss, and taking the challenge. And seeing that Anthony Davis wasn't out there, you take those situations for granted. And they made us pay for it early,"" Lillard said. ""I think we showed our maturity and growth in how we rebounded and adjusted and made the changes we needed to make."" Julius Randle scored 29 points, but Pelicans star Davis was sidelined by a right elbow sprain. Davis had returned from the injury Wednesday night against Golden State, when he collected 17 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in a 131-121 loss to the Warriors. Davis leads New Orleans with 25.2 points and 13 rebounds per game. He was replaced in the starting lineup against the Blazers by Jahlil Okafor. The Blazers were home after a 3-1 trip that included victories at Orlando, Indiana and Houston. Portland was without Maurice Harkless because of a lingering left knee injury. Harkless has played in five of the Blazers' eight games this season. Lillard had 10 points in the first quarter and the Blazers led 35-31. The Pelicans were paced by Randle, who had 23 points in the first half before he collected three fouls and went back to the bench. Seth Curry's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 51-44 advantage. E'Twaun Moore's 3-pointer got the Pelicans within three late in the half, but the Blazers led 70-65 at the break. Moore's floater got the Pelicans as close as 65-64 in the third quarter but Portland held New Orleans off until Randle's jumper and Nikola Mirotic's free throw tied it at 90. Portland hit consecutive 3-pointers to end the threat. The Blazers outscored the Pelicans 30-20 in the final quarter. ""The first three quarter of the game we gave ourselves a chance, then the fourth quarter we didn't score as well and we didn't get the stops when we needed them,"" Randle said. Al-Farouq Aminu had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Portland in his third double-double this season. The Blazers' reserves scored 50 points. Mirotic finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds for New Orleans, and Jrue Holiday also had a double-double with 17 points and 10 assists. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis warmed up with his teammates before the game. ... In his pregame talk with reporters, Alvin Gentry shot down reports of a confrontation the night before with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis. ""It couldn't be further from the truth,"" Gentry said, characterizing the conversation as friendly. Trail Blazers: Terry Stotts was coaching his 500th game for the Blazers. ... Portland's franchise high for 3-pointers is 21. ... Portland's point total was a season high. ... The Blazers scored 30-plus points in every quarter. ABOUT THOSE THREES: The Pelicans had eight 3-pointers compared to Portland's 18. ""We've gotta get guys off the line, you know? The point differential is 30 points from the 3-point line,"" Gentry said. ""I mean, we dominate in the paint, we shoot more free throws, but it's really, really difficult to make up a 30-point deficit from three. So we've got to get them off the line and make a few more of our own.""","401070797"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Things were going so well for Los Angeles Clippers guard Lou Williams on Friday night that even when one of his shots missed, he ended up getting credit for a basket. Williams scored 23 of his game-high 28 points in the second half in leading the Clippers to a 120-95 rout of the Orlando Magic. It was the Clippers' 10th straight win over the Magic. Williams hit all five 3-point attempts in the second half, including one that clearly bounced far off the rim. But he got credit anyway when referee Sean Corbin called goaltending on Magic rookie Mo Bamba. ""Lou got it going in the third and fourth quarter and that changed the game,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He is just an amazing, amazing shooter and he shoots from all angles. It used to be he could only go left and now he goes right. He is a professional scorer and you see it every time he plays."" Tobias Harris had 21 points and Danilo Gallinari 13 for Los Angeles, which led by 15 going into the fourth period and quickly pushed it to 25 after Williams hit three straight 3s to make it 106-81 with 6:57 left. Boban Marjanovic made his first start for the Clippers and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 19 and D.J. Augustin had 13 points for the Magic, who have lost four straight. Orlando cut an 18-point deficit to nine on three occasions in the third quarter, but never could sustain a rally. Fournier's driving layup made it 79-70 with 1:35 left in the quarter, but Milos Teodosic and Williams hit back-to-back 3-pointers and the Clippers took an 87-72 lead into the final period. ""Difficult, difficult night,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Effort level, body language, purpose of play . that was not even close to being acceptable, not for a professional basketball team. This is really disappointing."" ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT The Magic are coming off six straight losing seasons and appear headed in that direction after a 2-6 start this year. Clifford says his team needs to start its rebound with a change of attitude. ""We have the wrong, wrong attitude,"" Clifford said after his team was routed by the Clippers. ""There have been some tough times here and we have some guys who have been through that, but we have to have great attitude, great fight and great readiness and we had none of that tonight. Maybe this is going to be harder to do than I thought."" GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION The Los Angeles Clippers invited Magic rookie Mo Bamba in for a workout before last summer's NBA Draft and he made quite an impression on coach Doc Rivers. Bamba brought a CD of himself that contained highlights of his best offensive moves to show how far his game had progressed. ""He wanted us to see all that and it was impressive,"" Rivers said. ""Steve Ballmer (Clippers owner) was in the room and I think it was the most impressive interview we ever had in the times I've done it. He's long, he already has great touch, he shoots the ball pretty well. He's going to be a good player."" The Magic grabbed Bamba with the sixth pick in the first round. The Clippers picked 11th and selected point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. TIP-INS Clippers: C Marcin Gortat had 186 straight starts in his NBA career, including the first eight games this season, before taking a DNP-CD against Orlando. ... Montrezl Harrell had a double-double, 10 points, 12 rebounds, off the bench. Magic: PF Jonathan Isaac left the game in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle. He did not return. ... Orlando shot a team-record 43 3-point attempts in each of its last two games, but took only 17 against the Clippers. ... Orlando is 0-6 this season when trailing at halftime.","401070798"
"NEW YORK --  The Rockets had talked long enough about their struggles, and then it was time to do something about it. So during a timeout with the Brooklyn Nets carving up their defense early Friday night, the Rockets decided they didn't need to hear any more from their coaches. The only way they could solve things was by themselves. ""We just said, you all stay out for a second. Let us talk,"" Chris Paul said. ""At some point, enough is enough."" Paul had 32 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds, Carmelo Anthony added a season-high 28 points and Houston snapped a four-game losing streak with a 119-111 victory. Clint Capela finished with 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Eric Gordon contributed 21 points for the Rockets, who had stumbled to a 1-5 start a season after winning 65 games and falling a game short of the NBA Finals. ""We had to watch it, we had to look at it and we had to kind of just hold ourselves accountable to what's going on out there,"" Anthony said. ""Look our own selves in the mirror as individuals, as a team, figure out what we wanted to do and tonight we did that."" They did thanks to one of the best games as a Rocket for Paul, who had season bests in points and assists in the final game before his workload should ease Saturday with the expected return of James Harden. The league MVP missed his third straight game with a strained left hamstring and coach Mike D'Antoni said he would probably return for the second half of a back-to-back in Chicago. Anthony bounced back from a 2-for-12, eight-point performance against Portland by coming off the bench to hit six 3-pointers. Caris LeVert scored 29 points for the Nets, who got off to a sizzling start before the Rockets turned around the game. One of the NBA's most potent offenses had been held below 90 points in two of the previous three games after doing so only three times all last season. The offense was back Friday, but the defense took a while to get going. Brooklyn made 14 of its first 18 shots, including 13 of 14 inside the 3-point arc while simply driving by defenders. The Nets finished 15 of 21 in the opening quarter, taking a 32-25 lead. Paul kept the Rockets close with 13 points in the second, including a deep 3-pointer that cut it to 61-56 at halftime The Rockets then surged ahead with an 11-0 run in the third, with Anthony making two 3-pointers, a jumper and blocking a shot as Houston went ahead 76-69. Anthony hit two more 3s in the fourth. ""Third quarter was where they got their break,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We've had some issues there before and felt like they came out more aggressive and thought we missed some shots. They picked up their defense. I felt that."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston avoided matching its longest skid of last season. The Rockets dropped five in a row from Dec. 20-29. ... Paul's highest-scoring game with the Rockets is 37 points last Jan. 10 against Portland. Nets: Atkinson said there was no decision yet if rookies Rodions Kurucs and Dzanan Musa would play for Long Island on Saturday in its season opener. Both players worked out with the G League affiliate this week. ... The Nets scored 26 of their 32 first-quarter points in the paint, marking their most points in the paint in a quarter since having 26 in the first on Dec. 7, 2016, against Denver. HARDEN'S HOPES Harden has worked out without discomfort and D'Antoni said he likely would have returned Friday if the Rockets had been off following the game. But because they were playing on two straight nights and he wouldn't use Harden on both of them after returning from injury, D'Antoni is opting to wait the extra day and bring Harden back Saturday at Chicago. The league MVP was hurt near the end of a loss to Utah on Oct. 24 and Houston had been routed in both games since. ALL FOULED UP D'Antoni said before the game there was no explanation for Houston's offensive troubles, saying the Rockets were getting the same shots as last season, just shooting them 20 percent worse. ""Foul shots not going in. You don't change up a foul shot. We're not even making those,"" D'Antoni said. ""So we've obviously got some kind of malaise over us that we've got to shrug off and get going."" The Rockets entered shooting 70.2 percent at the line, 27th in the NBA, after finishing ninth last season at 78.1 percent.","401070799"
"WASHINGTON --  Russell Westbrook's Oklahoma City Thunder and John Wall's Washington Wizards both got off to poor starts to the season. Westbrook and Co. turned things around quickly. Wall's Wizards have not. The Thunder have gone from 0-4 to 4-4, picking up their fourth consecutive victory by beating the struggling, booed-at-home Wizards 134-111 behind Westbrook's 23 points and 12 assists Friday night. The outcome was decided in the second quarter, when OKC outscored Washington 44-20, a lopsided result Wizards coach Scott Brooks called ""ridiculous."" ""We just pride ourselves on defense, starting with myself and going down the line. That's our objective -- especially in my mind -- is to be the best defensive team in the league, just disrupt the game,"" said Westbrook, who sat out the final period. ""That's the biggest key for us every night. I'm going to continue to pride myself on that starting with myself: Defend at a high level and go on down the line."" The Wizards wish they could play well at that end of the court. Even though OKC was the team playing on the second night of a back-to-back, it looked a lot fresher and more active than Washington, which was coming off a two-day break and finally got to see new center Dwight Howard make his debut. After missing all of training camp, every exhibition game and the first seven regular-season games with a sore backside, Howard started and immediately appeared to have an impact, scoring 13 first-quarter points. But soon enough, Washington got into its usual bad habits, the ones that have led to loss after loss so far: ineffective defense and low-effort rebounding. ""They got layups after layups, wide-open 3s,"" Wall said. ""They did whatever they wanted."" The Wizards have lost five games in a row to drop to 1-7, and spectators let the players hear their displeasure in the second quarter, jeering when OKC went ahead 61-40 on Jerami Grant's dunk on a pass from Westbrook. When Paul George made his third straight 3 attempt, a night after going 0 for 10 from beyond the arc, it made the halftime score 79-50, equaling the Thunder's record for most points in a half. An Oklahoma City team averaging 109 points this season was already at 110 after three quarters. George wound up with 17 points to surpass 10,000 for his career, and Grant scored 22. Howard had 20 points on 7-of-8 shooting, three rebounds and four fouls in 23 minutes. When he was out of the game, he either laid down on his stomach on the sideline or stood. Bradley Beal scored 27 points, and Wall had 19 points and nine assists, but Washington's pair of All-Star guards also combined for 12 turnovers. The Thunder went up by as many as 33 points in the third quarter and shot 57 percent for the game. They outrebounded the Wizards 38-30. None of that should come as a surprise, given that Washington began the night allowing an NBA-worst 122.4 points per game and averaging only 41.3 rebounds, 27th in the 30-club league. ""I refuse,"" Beal said, ""to let the ship sink."" TIP-INS Thunder: Came in shooting 27 percent on 3s, but hit 47 percent -- 15 for 32 -- against Washington. ... George has complained of a nerve issue with his left foot, and coach Billy Donovan said George thinks it affects his defense. ""There's times where he wishes he could push off a little bit better and move a little bit better -- more to the extreme that he's capable of doing,"" Donovan said. ""I think he still feels he's hindered by it."" Wizards: Otto Porter Jr. played with a bruised big left toe and scored nine points in only 16 minutes. ... Brooks on Ian Mahinmi, who started at center while Howard was sidelined but now returns to a backup role: ""His minutes are going to shrink quite a bit, but he has to be ready whenever he's called on.""","401070800"
"CHICAGO --  Whenever the Indiana Pacers needed a big play, Victor Oladipo delivered. It was an all-too-familiar finish for the Chicago Bulls. Oladipo had 25 points and 14 rebounds, Darren Collison made a tiebreaking jumper down the stretch, and the Pacers topped the Bulls 107-105 on Friday night. ""The great thing about this team is we respond well,"" Oladipo said. ""We get on each other. We get upset at each other. We challenge each other, but at the end of the day, we're still a family."" Myles Turner added 18 points and Collison finished with 14 as Indiana earned its fifth consecutive road win for its longest such streak since April 2012. Turner also matched a career high with six blocked shots, including Antonio Blakeney's desperate jumper as the final seconds ticked off. The Pacers trailed by as many as 18 early in the second quarter. ""We stayed with it,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""We started to get some stops. Second unit came in and got us back into the game, and the second half, we had to fight and score, and get stops."" Indiana appeared to be in solid shape with a 95-91 lead with 30.5 seconds left. But Blakeney converted a four-point play after he was fouled by Collison on a 3-point try from the top of the key. ""I'm just shooting with confidence,"" said Blakeney, who finished with a career-high 22 points. ""I've been working hard."" Collison then made up for the mistake with a pullup jumper with about 18 seconds remaining, putting Indiana back in front. The veteran guard was 6 for 15 from the field. Chicago then had three chances on its final possession and came up empty. Zach LaVine missed a fadeaway jumper and Justin Holiday was off on an open 3-pointer before Blakeney was blocked by Turner. ""Of course I thought it was going down,"" Holiday said. ""I couldn't believe the ball bounced to me. I was like, oh yeah, it's over. But some fall, some don't."" It was the second straight heartbreaking result for Chicago, which lost 108-107 to Denver in overtime on Wednesday night. The Bulls are winless on a four-game homestand heading into the finale Saturday night against Houston. ""I mean it's a good thing we're in these situations,"" Holiday said. ""Obviously we would rather be up and not be in them, but we're going to need this down the road to be able to win games."" LaVine scored nine of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, and Holiday finished with 19 points. Jabari Parker and rookie Wendell Carter Jr. each had 11 points. THERE HE IS Veteran center Robin Lopez checked in for the Bulls with 3:54 left in the first half for his first action since Oct. 22 at Dallas. Lopez was listed as a Did Not Play-Coach's Decision for Chicago's previous five games. Lopez finished with two rebounds, two blocked shots and an assist in almost four minutes against Indiana. TIP-INS Pacers: It was Oladipo's first double-double of the season. ... Thaddeus Young grabbed nine rebounds, giving him 1,005 with the Pacers. ... Indiana shot 47.1 percent (40 for 85) from the field. It was shooting 50.6 percent from the floor coming into the night, second in the NBA.

""He really just did straight ahead running today and he did spot shooting,"" Hoiberg said. There is no timetable yet for his return. ...

"DALLAS --  Allonzo Trier's two-way contract with New York is looking more and more like a one-way deal. As in, the rookie guard isn't leaving the Knicks anytime soon. Trier scored 19 of his career-high 23 points during a second-half surge, fellow rookie Mitchell Robinson had his first double-double and the Knicks beat Dallas 118-106 Friday night, handing the Mavericks their sixth straight loss. ""I've been here, what is this, 10 games now?"" Trier asked, overshooting the number by one after missing just two shots (8 of 10). ""It's been a lot of fun and I'm learning more each and every day, and we're learning more about everybody on this team and how to use everybody, not just me."" Tim Hardaway Jr. had 18 points and six rebounds to help the Knicks win for the second time in three games after a five-game skid that followed a victory in their opener. Robinson set career highs with 13 points and 10 rebounds. New York outscored Dallas 33-18 in the third quarter after trailing by three at halftime, and led by as many as 17 in the fourth, when Trier scored 14 . Dennis Smith Jr. scored 23 points and 19-year-old rookie Luka Doncic had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Mavericks, who matched their longest losing streak from the lost 2017-18 season. That six-game skid a year ago led to a 2-14 start and 24-58 finish, and this slump followed a 2-1 start that marked Dallas' first winning record since the end of the 2015-16 season. The Mavericks opened 2-13 two seasons ago. ""At this point, we've got to get angry,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We've got to get more together. We've got to have two great practice days. That's where we are."" The Knicks shot just 24 percent from 3-point territory against the worst defending team from long range, but they made up for it inside the arc. New York shot 71 percent (39 of 55) on 2-pointers and was at 55 percent overall for the game. Lance Thomas scored nine of his 10 points when the Knicks took control in the third and assisted during the surge on Robinson's reverse alley-oop dunk . ""I was high in the air, so why not just go ahead and do something?"" asked Robinson, the former Louisiana high school standout whose previous rebounding high was six. Dorian Finney-Smith had 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting for the Mavericks, but Harrison Barnes was held to 1 of 7 from 3-point range while scoring 14 points. DeAndre Jordan had a season-low four points and matched his lowest rebounding total this season with 10. TIP-INS Knicks: Damyean Dotson just missed his second double-double of the season, finishing with 11 points and eight rebounds. ... Others among the seven double-figure scorers were Enes Kanter (13 points) and Mario Hezonja (11). Mavericks: G Devin Harris was out again with a left hamstring strain. He hasn't played since the opener. ... J.J. Barea matched his season low with two points, attempting just five shots. He equaled Doncic with six assists. MITCHELL'S MODEL Robinson's best game so far came against Jordan, the 6-foot-11 center who extended his Dallas record with his ninth straight double-digit rebound game to start a season. Robinson matched Jordan on the boards and was much more of a factor offensively, going 5 of 6 from the field. ""I think DeAndre is a guy that Mitchell looks up to, and really respects,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Obviously there are a lot of similarities there that we're going to be using DeAndre as a model for Mitchell."" DEFENSE FIRST Another versatile game from Doncic, who has been Dallas' best player in his first two-plus weeks, prompted questions for Carlisle over whether the rookie should have a more prominent role in the offense. Carlisle was thinking about the sixth game out of nine in which the Mavericks have allowed at least 50 percent shooting. ""I'm so much more focused on the defense that the questions about the offense, to me, are insignificant,"" the coach said. ""It's become too commonplace. That's not going to get it, and I know we can do better.""","401070802"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Mike Conley is finally starting to feel like himself again. Conley, who missed most of last season with a heel injury and just began practicing full speed in September, scored a season-high 28 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies over the short-handed Utah Jazz 110-100 on Friday night. ""Some timing is still off a bit with the shot and the legs and getting the body back together, but tonight's game as opposed to the first time we played them is night and day,"" Conley said. Aiding his return has been the steady presence of teammate Marc Gasol. ""We've played together so much and we just play the game the right way,"" Conley said. ""It's easy to come back when you have a guy like that who knows where you need the ball and gets the best opportunity for your team to score."" Conley and Gasol, who had 17 points, orchestrated a motion offense with deft passing that kept the Jazz guessing and out of position as the Grizzlies shot 51 percent to win their third straight game. ""Once you make shots, everything gets easier. But we played unselfish, exploiting that pick-and-roll and mixing rolls with pops,"" said Gasol, who added 10 rebounds and seven assists, often initiating from the high post. Utah played without star guard Donovan Mitchell, the team's leading scorer. He sat out with a right hamstring strain. The Jazz missed their creative star on offense, and Conley said: ""It definitely helped that Donovan didn't play."" But the team pinned this loss on failing to stop the Grizzlies. ""Our group has to stake its claim on the defensive end,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""No matter who's out there, that's something that we can control. ... The defensive end is where we have to put our focus."" Ricky Rubio paced the Jazz with 22 points, and Jae Crowder scored 12 of his 18 in the fourth quarter. But he couldn't draw Utah closer than seven after Memphis' big run at the beginning of the period. ""I found my shot. I knew Donovan was out, so I had to be a little more aggressive in looking for my shot. It worked in the beginning,"" Rubio said. The Jazz led by 12 in the first half but the Grizzlies used a 30-18 third quarter to move in front. Joe Ingles, who had 19 points and became the seventh Jazz player with 500 3-pointers, sank a 3 on Utah's first possession of the fourth to get within two. But the Grizzlies scored 11 consecutive points, including back-to-back 3s by Gasol and MarShon Brooks. Shelvin Mack, who played for Utah from 2015-17, had 19 points -- the most he's scored since he was with the Jazz. ""When the shots are there I've got to take them,"" Mack said. ""Mike's able to drive and make plays for me."" Utah has dropped all three home games this season, including a 92-84 loss to Memphis just 10 days ago. The last time the Jazz started 0-3 at home was Ty Corbin's final season as coach in 2013-14. DRAWING RUDY FROM THE RIM Several times, the Grizzlies forced Utah's switching defense into uncomfortable matchups. ""We did a good job of taking advantage of their switches,"" Conley said. ""They're a very long team, especially with Rudy Gobert down there. When we got him out there guarding a guard, we got penetration and kick-out and that opened up the paint."" THE TWO-MAN GAME Gasol said it took all of ""22 seconds"" to feel comfortable with Conley in their first pickup game together this fall. ""We read basketball the same way. He sees the same angles that I see. Once we look at each other, we know what each other should do,"" Gasol said.

"PHOENIX --  The Toronto Raptors weren't at their best, but good enough to pull away from the Phoenix Suns for another victory in the best start to a season in the Canadian franchise's history. Kawhi Leonard scored 19 points and the Raptors used a 14-2 fourth-quarter run to finally put away the pesky Phoenix Suns 107-98 on Friday night. Jonas Valanciunas added 16 points and Serge Ibaka 14 for the Raptors, who improved to 8-1, the best nine-game start in franchise history. Kyle Lowry had 11 points and 12 assists. ""It is a 48 minute game and I think we are playing pretty good basketball for about 28 minutes right now,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We got to stretch that. I don't think we will ever get to 48 minutes, but we want to get in the 40s probably after the new year."" Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, had 17 points and 18 rebounds for the Suns, losers of seven in a row since winning their season opener. Isaiah Canaan scored 19 and Devin Booker 18 for Phoenix. Booker returned after missing three games with a strained hamstring. Phoenix trailed by only four early in the fourth quarter before Toronto's decisive 14-2 surge. ""Well, our effort was better,"" Suns first-year coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Having book and Canaan back, I mean that helps a lot. We have to sustain playing a physical, strong team like Toronto. We have to sustain and play 48 minutes. We had a stretch in the fourth quarter that we couldn't handle the physicality, their length, their size. ... And we were just tired."" The Suns led most of the first half but never by more than seven points. Phoenix was up 52-48 at the break, with Canaan scoring 12 points and Ayton adding 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Raptors opened the third quarter with a 13-2 run. Leonard's three-point play on a drive to the hoop put Toronto up 56-54 and Danny Green's 3-pointer from the corner made it 61-54. Phoenix, though, scored the next seven, tying it at 61-61 on Booker's 18-footer. Despite missing four free throws during that stretch, the Raptors responded with a 13-3 run to lead 74-64 after Fred VanVleet's 3-pointer with 2:04 left in the third quarter. Josh Jackson's 3 at the third-quarter buzzer cut Toronto's lead to 77-71 entering the fourth. Jackson's jumper to start the fourth quarter cut it to35 77-73 but the Raptors finally took control for good. VanVleet sank a 3-pointer, followed by a steal and layup and Norman Powell sank a 3 to finish a 14-2 outburst that put the Raptors up 91-75 with 8:35 remaining. Toronto stretched it to 99-81 on Valanciunas' layup. Phoenix outscored the Raptors 17-8 the rest of the way. ""We want to be an aggressive, defense team, get hands on some balls, deflect, get out and transition, get out and get some 3s and layups,"" said Leonard, who jammed his left foot late in the fourth quarter but later said he was OK.

"Jimmy Butler lets reporters know he isn't happy with the constant questions about him sitting out. (0:36) OAKLAND, Calif. --  Draymond Green is playing the best coach Steve Kerr has ever seen, doing all the little things on both ends to spark his team. Stephen Curry's shot is on from everywhere, while Kevin Durant is his usual efficient, dominant self. The two-time defending NBA champions know they can be even better. Durant had 33 points and 13 rebounds, Curry contributed 28 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-99 on Friday night for their seventh straight win. ""Our fourth-quarter defense was tremendous, everybody flying to the ball. I thought Draymond set the tone,"" Kerr said. ""I'm not sure if I've seen Draymond play better since I've been here than what he's doing right now. His defense has always been fantastic, but he's taking such good care of the ball. He had a couple turnovers tonight but over the course of the last few weeks, just the decision-making, the poise, the ability to play through adversity, he knows how much we need him. He's lifting everybody else up. It's been really fun to watch him play."" Klay Thompson scored 22 points and hit consecutive 3-pointers 50 seconds apart early in the fourth to put Golden State ahead 91-89 with 10:17 to play. Green then got back-to-back baskets, one helped by goaltending. Derrick Rose played five minutes in the first quarter for Minnesota and scored three points, then didn't return because of left ankle soreness -- two nights after the 2011 MVP scored a career-high 50 points in a victory against Utah. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 22 points. Minnesota was outrebounded 61-39. Jimmy Butler scored 21 for Minnesota after sitting out Wednesday to rest. Tyus Jones also returned and had eight points on 3-for-11 shooting after missing the win over the Jazz because of a sore right foot. Durant made his first six shots, and eight of the initial 11 he took, on the way to 20 points in the first half. Green had seven of his 11 assists by the 4:40 mark of the opening quarter and has 61 assists over the past six games. He also had nine points and nine boards. ""I think it definitely ignites this crowd for sure. It ignites my teammates as well, just give them something to feed off of, an extra boost of energy to feed off of,"" Green said of all he does. ""That's my job. That's what I bring to this team."" Alfonzo McKinnie added eight points and eight rebounds off the bench in the Warriors' fifth straight home victory against the T-Wolves. Minnesota was outscored 33-12 in the fourth. ""We just didn't hit some shots. It's a two-way street,"" Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""They played great defense, where we also missed some shots that we were hitting the whole game."" Both teams shot 50 percent or better in the first quarter. ""Over the course of 48 (minutes) if we stay locked in and focused, there's going to be a breaking point,"" Curry said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Six players made a 3-pointer in the first half. ...

Yet that doesn't mean Cousins will be in games anytime soon. ""I love how far he's come, but I don't want people to get the idea that he's getting close to coming back,"" Kerr said.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Philadelphia star big man Joel Embiid revels in the chances to go against Detroit center Andre Drummond. And Embiid doesn't stop going at Drummond when the game is over. Embiid scored 32 of his 39 points in a dominating first half and had 17 rebounds and then let Drummond know about it afterward, leading the 76ers to a 109-99 victory over the Pistons on Saturday. Embiid made 10 of 18 field goals and 18 of 23 free throws to help Philadelphia improve to 6-0 at home. Drummond and Embiid have butted heads throughout their careers, with Embiid recently saying he ""owns real estate"" in Drummond's head after Detroit's big man was ejected in the Pistons' 133-132 overtime victory on Oct. 23. ""He's a fun matchup,"" Embiid said. ""I feel like I dominate every game, especially against him."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey and Drummond questioned the officiating. Drummond and backup center Zaza Pachulia were in foul trouble early trying to guard Embiid, and the teams combined for 63 fouls and 92 free-throw attempts. ""I don't understand how the game was being called,"" Casey said. Said Drummond, ""It's like you have to play with your hands behind your back; you can't really touch nobody. That's the way they're calling the game right now. I have to figure a way to adjust. It's hard to play like that."" Embiid's first-half numbers were astounding. He made 8 of 9 shots, including his only 3-point attempt, and 15 of 17 free-throw attempts with eight rebounds and two blocks in 17 minutes in a one-sided duel with Drummond. Drummond went scoreless in four foul-plagued minutes in the opening half and finished with eight points and nine rebounds in 21 minutes. Embiid went right at Drummond early on Saturday, drawing a foul just 1:24 into the contest and then a second on Drummond 1:16 later. The Philadelphia big man held up two fingers after that one, letting everyone know Drummond had picked up his second, and Drummond exited to the bench for Pachulia. Pachulia was no match for Embiid either, drawing four fouls in 10 first-half minutes. The 76ers' lead grew to as many as 24 points, 58-34, when rookie Landry Shamet converted a three-point play after draining a 13-foot jumper and the ensuing free throw. The Pistons scored the first 13 points of the second half over 3:55 as Philadelphia went 0-for-5 with three turnovers to start the third period. That surge cut Detroit's deficit to nine, 69-60, but the 76ers' advantage built up in the opening 24 minutes proved to be too great. Detroit got as close as down five with 4:48 remaining before an Embiid layup and J.J. Redick 3-pointer pushed the lead to a comfortable 10 points. SECOND-HALF SURGE Casey said the Pistons have to start contests like they began the second half on Saturday. ""Our starts have been atrocious,"" Casey said. ""If we come out at the start of the game like the second half, we're a pretty good team. I loved our defensive effort in the second half. SECOND-HALF SLIDE After shooting 53 percent from the field (19-for-36), including 43 percent from the arc (6-for-14) in the opening 24 minutes, Philadelphia slipped to 27 percent (9-for-33) and 20 percent (3-for-15), respectively, after halftime.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  This was the effort Hornets coach James Borrego was hoping to get from Jeremy Lamb when he named him the team's starting shooting guard before the season. Lamb had a season-high 19 points and eight rebounds, and Charlotte made light work of the Cleveland Cavaliers, winning 126-94 on Saturday night. Borrego said Lamb was ""fantastic,"" and now wants to see him bring that same aggressive attack-the-basket mentality every night. ""This is where I see Jeremy helping us,"" Borrego said. ""I think he fits in that starting unit. ... I loved his aggressiveness tonight, getting to the rim. I think he got to the paint more than anybody tonight. If people want to put two guys on Kemba (Walker) that's his time to attack and a lot of his attacks and aggressiveness now are in transition."" Borrego said his only concern with Lamb entering the season was if he could guard the opposing team's shooter night after night. He's had some help so far from Nic Batum, but it's clear he has improved in that area. ""Night after night at the two guard position you have to be ready to guard,"" Lamb said. ""I've been working to try to keep getting better on both ends of the floor. Defensively is a big thing I need to work on, and I'm gonna keep working."" Two-time All-Star Kemba Walker had 18 points and Malik Monk added 16 for the Hornets, who improved to .500 on the season. Charlotte had balanced scoring throughout, with seven players finishing in double digits, including five off the bench. J.R. Smith scored 14 points for the struggling Cavaliers (1-8), who are playing without the injured Kevin Love and put up very little resistance on defense. The Hornets looked sluggish early on, but broke the game open late in the third behind a 26-11 run that made it a 20-point game. Tony Parker, who has been a big addition for the Hornets as a player and as a leader of the second team, led the way during the key stretch, scoring on a pair of floaters and then delivering a perfect alley-oop pass to Monk, who soared above the rim after losing his man on a backdoor cut. Unlike Thursday night, when the Hornets surrendered a 19-point third quarter lead to Russell Westbrook and the Thunder, Charlotte had no intention of letting this one slip away. They quickly extended the lead to 29 points when Walker knocked down his fourth 3-pointer with 7:14 remaining in the game. He exited the game shortly after. TIP INS Cavaliers: Were outrebounded 49-28. ... Kyle Korver had 11 points, with three 3-pointers. Hornets: Owner Michael Jordan took in the game courtside, sitting at the end of the Hornets' bench. ... David Tepper, the owner of the other major sports franchise in the city, the NFL's Carolina Panthers, also attended the game. BENCH GETTING IT DONE The Hornets entered the game second in the NBA in bench scoring and got it done again against the Cavs with five reserves scoring in double digits. Borrego said he feels like the second unit is establishing an identity, adding that ""I love our bench."" ""They are playing with haste, playing with urgency,"" Borrego said. ""Tony Parker understands what we're trying to get done offensively and getting Malik Monk in the right spots."" DIFFERENT LOOKS Cavaliers acting head coach Larry Drew used several different combinations on the floor throughout the night, but nothing seemed to work. ""This team is obviously going in a different direction than it's been the last four years,"" Drew said of the post-LeBron James era. ""As a coach, you still have to find what works. And right now I don't know what works for this team. Trying to mix it up and give it a different look as far as playing guys and different combinations. ""","401070807"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo heard the final buzzer and pranced to the sideline, pointing both index fingers to the floor, and mouthing, ""My city."" Oladipo's 3-pointer with 3.4 seconds remaining Saturday night gave Indiana a 102-101 comeback victory over the Boston Celtics and was yet another example of his increasingly routine heroics at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The All-Star guard, who was battling bronchitis, finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds and said he envisions his heroics. ""Moments like this, yeah,"" Oladipo said, ""and moments like this down the line."" The game was a tense affair with 10 ties and 18 lead changes and a compelling matchup between Indiana and Boston. The Celtics led 101-97 when Kyrie Irving hit a 3 with 37.2 seconds to go, but Jaylen Brown fouled Oladipo at 29.2 seconds, and he made both free throws to set up the dramatic finish. With 11 seconds left, Oladipo rebounded Irving's miss, dribbled across midcourt and pulled up from the right wing, launching over the outstretched arms of Boston center Al Horford. As the ball dropped through the net, Oladipo skipped toward the bench. ""We were really calm,"" Oladipo said. ""The crowd was excited, but we were calm. We knew we needed one more stop."" After the Celtics used a timeout to advance the ball and draw up a final play, Gordon Hayward inbounded but had his pass deflected and stolen by Oladipo, snapping a four-game win streak for Boston, which reached the Eastern Conference finals last spring. The Pacers, coming off a first-round playoff exit, passed an early-season test in large part by repeatedly earning free throws. While Boston attempted only nine, and made six, Indiana shot 19 of 25 from the line. That came in handy on a night Boston shot 43 percent (38 for 88) and the Pacers 41 percent (36 for 87). ""We're living on the edge a little too much,"" said Horford, who had 14 points and six rebounds. ""Maybe this will wake us up."" Tyreke Evans had 17 points for the Pacers, Bojan Bogdanovic scored 16, and Domantas Sabonis added 12 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Indiana trailed 28-18 after the first quarter, and by as many as 13 in the first half, but forged a tie at 45 at halftime and knotted the score at 72 on Evans' last-second 3 to close the third period. ""It was huge moving forward, just to get a good spirit and energy for our season,"" Indiana guard Darren Collison said. ""We all came together. Everybody had their moments. In those situations when you're playing a good team you can't lose focus. You just never know when the game is going to change."" Marcus Morris had a team-high 23 points and six rebounds for the Celtics. ""We got beat by a good team,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""Oladipo made a big shot."" TIP-INS Celtics: Irving finished with 18 points and six boards, and Hayward was the only starter not to score in double figures, finishing with four points and seven rebounds. . Marcus Smart contributed three points and nine assists. . The loss also snapped Boston's three-game win streak in Indianapolis. Pacers: TJ Leaf, a second-year forward out of UCLA, entered with only two points all season but scored five Saturday in his customary second-quarter stint. Leaf played the first five minutes of the fourth quarter and added a dunk to finish with seven points. . The team waived forward Ben Moore and recalled center Ike Anigbogu from the G League. WORKING HIS WAY BACK Stevens said Hayward, coming back from leg surgery, would remain restricted to fewer than 30 minutes per game for the foreseeable future. ""He's in the `increase by a tick' phase,"" Stevens said. ""We'll just keep evaluating him week to week. It's a long-term plan based on getting him back to not only playing one game but 82 games. He's probably pretty frustrated by it at times, but does a good job not showing it."" DEJ<U+FFFD> VU Oladipo's shot came just more than one year after his first signature finger-pointing, ""My city"" celebration. On Oct. 29, 2017, three months after being traded to Indiana from Oklahoma City, Oladipo's 3-pointer gave the Pacers a 97-94 win over San Antonio.","401070808"
"ATLANTA --  On one of the best nights of his young career, Trae Young's favorite pass set up Vince Carter, the league's oldest player. Young had 24 points and a career-high 15 assists, Carter's jumper gave Atlanta the lead for good, and the Hawks beat Josh Richardson and the Miami Heat 123-118 on Saturday. Carter's 17-foot jumper off a pass from the 20-year-old Young broke a 118-all tie. ""Vince is the man,"" Young said of the 41-year-old Carter. ""It was crazy, like a little throwback moment for me. From a few guys talking in here after the game, it was a throwback moment for everybody."" Taurean Prince and Dewayne Dedmon each scored 15 points for the Hawks, who had dropped four in a row. Young also had six rebounds in his ninth NBA game. Carter had 12 points despite giving up his starting spot so rookie Omari Spellman could make his first start. ""It was Vince Carter being a pro, wanting to help some other guys get going and sacrificing,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Richardson scored 32 points, setting a career high for the second time this week, but Miami was held scoreless in the final three minutes of its third straight loss. The Heat trailed by 15 in the third quarter before rallying to a 111-110 lead in the fourth. Players on each team were quick to launch 3-pointers in the fast-paced game. The Hawks made 13 of 32 3s, and the Heat connected on 16 of 40, including 6 of 10 by Richardson. Miami allowed more than 120 points for the third straight game. ""I feel like there wasn't a whole lot of defense being played both ways,"" Richardson said. ""We let them score too easy."" A 12-0 run, capped by a 3-pointer and pullup jumper by Young, gave Atlanta its biggest lead at 86-71. Young dribbled through traffic and made a short floater at the buzzer to give Atlanta a 102-93 lead entering the final period. Richardson's jumper tied it at 116. Following a flagrant foul against Justise Winslow, Young's two free throws got the lead back for Atlanta. Miami held out point guard Goran Dragic due to persistent pain in his right foot. Dragic, second on the team with 17.7 points per game, had a cortisone shot earlier in the week. Dwyane Wade had 19 points for the Heat. TIP-INS Heat: Wayne Ellington made his season debut after returning from a left ankle injury. He finished with five points. ...

JERSEY SWAP Wade and Carter swapped jerseys following the game. Wade, who has announced this is his final NBA season, said he enjoyed the on-court competition with Carter. ""We were having fun,"" the 36-year-old Wade said. ""Guys our age, that's what we're here for, to enjoy the game. He's a little older than me but we're here to enjoy the game.

"CHICAGO -- James Harden wasn't quite back in MVP form, yet he was good enough when the Houston Rockets needed him. Harden scored 25 points, including 11 in a decisive run in the third quarter in his return to the Houston lineup, and the Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls 96-88 on Saturday night. Harden, the NBA's reigning MVP, had missed three games with a strained left hamstring. He connected for 11 straight points, including three 3-pointers, in a span of 1 minute, 59 seconds in the third as the Rockets went on a 15-0 run. ""Just playing in a full game, contact and all that, felt like it's been a minute,"" Harden said. ""So I just wanted to get out there and just try to be myself. ""I think I did a pretty good job of that. Too many turnovers [eight], but once I get my flow back in rhythm, those will [decrease]."" Harden also had seven assists, and guard Chris Paul has no doubts Harden be his old self before long. ""It was good to see James get going in his first game back,"" Paul said. ""For us, it's about building."" Carmelo Anthony had 17 points and James Ennis added 15 despite just over 17 minutes of playing time as the Rockets won their second game in two nights after starting the season 1-5. Chicago led 59-58 midway through the third quarter before the Rockets and Harden went ahead for good, outscoring the Bulls 21-7 in the period. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 21 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. had 14 points and 13 rebounds. Jabari Parker added 15 points as the Bulls lost their fourth consecutive game -- going 0-4 in the homestand -- and dropped their fifth straight to the Rockets. Houston opened a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter. Chicago narrowed it to five points with 4:01 left using a 12-2 run and capitalizing on stretch of cold shooting by Houston. ""We shut it down, and once you shut it down you can't turn it back on,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We had one bad quarter and unfortunately it was a really bad third quarter,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We were settling for shots. In fourth quarter, we got back in it by attacking the rim and getting to the free throw line."" The Bulls finished with 19 turnovers, including what Hoiberg called ""mindless"" ones down the stretch, to blunt their late comeback. Harden began slowly in his return to the starting lineup. He didn't score until completing a driving layup with 3:55 left in the second quarter. Then he hit back-to-back 3s and had 10 points at the half. Harden suffered the hamstring injury near the end of the loss to Utah on Oct. 24, and Houston was routed in the next two games. The Rockets beat the Nets in Brooklyn 119-111 on Friday as Harden got an extra day of rest. Guard Eric Gordon was held out of Saturday's game with abductor strain, suffered at Brooklyn. The Bulls held their own with the Rockets in a see-saw, open first half and led 56-54 at intermission. Neither team had more than a five-point lead in the first half. Ennis, in his second game back after missing three with a strained right hamstring, led all scorers with 13 points at the half. Parker had 11 for Chicago. ENNIS THE (POTENTIAL) MENACE D'Antoni praised Ennis' effort and thinks the 28-year-old forward will only improve as his hamstring gets stronger. ""The guy can play,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's been hampered by the hamstring since the first game. But 15 points in 17 minutes [17:18] and the energy he gives you ... he's going to be really good."" TIP-INS Rockets: Before the game D'Antoni didn't have details of Gordon's injury, but thought the guard, who has averaged 15 points through seven games, would be out day-to-day. ""Now we get James back, but we lose Eric,"" D'Antoni said, while noting injuries to top players have taxed other Rockets who aren't used to as much playing time. ... D'Antoni's voice was raspy and barely audible before Saturday's game. He attributed it to his team pulling out its second victory of the season at Brooklyn on Friday. ""I celebrated last night and lost my voice,"" D'Antoni said ""We won a game."" Bulls: Hoiberg expects his injury-depleted team will soon get a boost from the return of F Lauri Markkanen (right elbow sprain) and G Denzel Valentine (left ankle sprain), but still doesn't have an exact timetable. ""Denzel will continue to ramp up his activity in the next couple days, and Lauri is doing a little bit more still,"" Hoiberg said, adding that Markkanen might be ready to ""get on floor"" in about a week. ... Hoiberg said Bobby Portis (right knee sprain) and Kris Dunn (left knee sprain) ""are still a ways away.""","401070810"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs were nearly flawless in their execution against New Orleans, and that only added to the consternation of Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. DeMar DeRozan had 26 points, LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points and 12 rebounds and the Spurs defeated New Orleans 109-95 Saturday, handing the Pelicans their fifth straight loss. New Orleans has lost all five by double digits after opening the season with four straight wins. Gentry could be heard yelling at his team in their locker room following the game. ""We're trying to hit grand slams when all we need to do is hit singles,"" Gentry said. ""We need to just move the basketball and let the game come to us and stop trying to force the issue. We've done that the last few games. We have to get back to being who we are, that's a team that moves the basketball that makes elementary simple plays and execute. That's the way you win games in the league, that's exactly what they just did."" San Antonio had nine turnovers, including five in the fourth quarter when the outcome was essentially decided. Dante Cunningham had a season-high 15 points and Patty Mills had 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists as San Antonio won its fourth straight. Jrue Holiday had 29 points and Anthony Davis had 17 points and eight rebounds to lead the Pelicans. Davis returned after missing Thursday's game with a sprained right elbow. San Antonio held New Orleans to 17 points in the opening period and 39 points in the first half, season lows for each team. The Spurs became the first team to hold the Pelicans below 100 points this season. ""(The team's defense is) coming along, you know, we just preach consistency,"" DeRozan said. ""The coaching staff and Pop stay on us every day about the same thing. We keep in mind every time we go out there to be better defensively and its showing."" After trailing 15-8, the Spurs moved out to a two-point lead on a 11-2 run sparked by Cunningham diving on the floor defensively for a loose ball. ""That's why I guess I got moved into the lineup,"" Cunningham said. ""That's what he (Spurs coach Gregg Popovich) wants out of me. That's my thing, I guess. So, if coach wants me to set the tone, I have the set the tone, I have to give that energy and be ready to give it every night."" San Antonio's bench continued to control the play, outscoring New Orleans 33-13, including 14 points by Marco Belinelli. The Pelicans finished with 16 turnovers and shot 17 for 30 from the line. ""We're not playing defense, we're not guarding anybody,"" Davis said. ""We're making the game harder on ourselves. It shouldn't be this hard to score buckets and so easy for them on the other end."" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans has been outscored by an average of 14.6 points in their five-game skid. . Davis grabbed his left knee in pain after colliding with Cunningham for a loose ball with 6 minutes remaining but quickly smiled and rose after the initial burst of pain. . The Pelicans scored 17 points in the first quarter and 39 points in the first half, both season lows. Their previous season low for a quarter was 18 points in the second against Utah on Oct. 27 and 24 in the opening period against Denver on Oct. 29. New Orleans' previous low for the first half was 45 points against Denver on Oct. 29. Spurs: DeRozan has scored at least 25 points in seven of the team's first eight games this season. The only other San Antonio player to do so was George Gervin in 1978-79. . The Spurs are 44-17 against the Hornets/Pelicans since they relocated to New Orleans in 2003. It's the most victories against the city's second NBA franchise by any team. . Cunningham had scored 20 points total in the team's first seven games. His previous high was four points, which he scored in the team's previous three games. WELCOME BACK Retired Spurs guard Manu Ginobili received a thunderous ovation when he appeared on the video screens at the AT&amp;T Center late in the game. It was Ginobili's first game as a spectator since retiring from the Spurs in July. WELCOME ADDITION Cunningham started his fifth game, which is probably five more starts than the Spurs expected when they signed him late in the offseason. The 6-foot-8 forward has given San Antonio a needed boost defensively. ""Dante has been not exactly a surprise, but we didn't expect him to be playing all these minutes and he's taking advantage of the opportunity,"" Popovich said. ""I think he's been really good for us. He sets the tone defensively.""","401070811"
"DENVER --  Mason Plumlee watched as his 3-pointer swished through the net, and the big man started to shimmy down the court as the Denver bench erupted in celebration. No one expected Plumlee to drain one from beyond the arc, but the Nuggets are doing a lot of things nobody expected this season. Gary Harris scored 20 points and Malik Beasley and Plumlee hit key 3-pointers in a fourth-quarter flurry, leading Denver to a 103-88 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. The Nuggets outscored the Jazz 35-15 in the fourth thanks to a gritty defense and Plumlee's first 3-pointer. He had only taken 18 shots from beyond the arc in his five-year career, including one this season. But this time, he drained one in front of his own bench during an 18-0 run. ""It was the end of the shot clock and we had to get it up so I took it,"" Plumlee said. ""It's funny how it started a run. They took a timeout so I could have more time to have fun."" Jamal Murray scored 19 for Denver, which won its fourth straight and has won eight of nine games so far. The Nuggets' great start is due, in part, to an improved defense that is allowing just 101.9 points a game, almost seven fewer than last season. It's a pace they want to continue throughout the season. ""We're 8-1 and we have one of the best defenses in the NBA, so why not?"" coach Michael Malone said. ""That's our challenge. Let's not get soft with success."" Jae Crowder scored 21 points off the bench for Utah, which has lost three straight. The Jazz got a scare when guard Donovan Mitchell left the game in the fourth quarter with a left ankle injury. Mitchell, who finished with 16 points, missed Friday night's loss to Memphis with a right hamstring injury. He was helped off favoring his left leg, but returned a few minutes later. ""I was just being a baby,"" Mitchell said. ""I'm good. I've twisted an ankle before. It's not a great feeling. I don't tape my ankles, so I'll probably start."" Denver's Nikola Jokic flirted with a triple-double, but finished three points shy of the mark. He had a season-high 16 assists and 10 rebounds. He finished with seven points and has scored just 11 in the last two games combined, but Denver has won both. The Jazz led 77-71 early in the fourth quarter but went cold as Denver took control. Beasley's 3-pointer gave the Nuggets a 79-77 lead and Plumlee beat the shot clock with another 3 that increased the lead to five. Utah missed seven straight shots during a 24-3 run by Denver that turned a six-point deficit into a 95-80 lead. Denver held the Jazz to four made field goals in the fourth. ""A lot of effort, man,"" Plumlee said of the defense. ""Schematically we're not doing anything different but the multiple effort's there."" The Jazz shot 40.7 from the field and just 19.4 percent from 3-point range. ""The score didn't reflect our effort,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""But ultimately you've got to put the ball in the basket. We weren't able to do that in the fourth quarter."" TIP-INS Jazz: G Alec Burks missed his third straight game with a chip fracture in his left hand. He has not played in the last four games. ... Favors played 19 minutes despite dealing with left knee soreness. He finished with 12 points. Nuggets: Denver started the 1976-77 season 8-0, the first season it was in the NBA. ... The Nuggets have held four of their opponents to below 100 points. They've won all four games. HOME SWEET HOME Denver won 31 games at Pepsi Center last season and is 5-0 at home to start this year. It's a big difference from four seasons ago when the Nuggets finished below 19-22 in Denver. ""I remember getting booed off the court. Nobody was there and tonight it was a sellout,"" Harris said. ""It shows you how far we've come but we still have a long way to go.""","401070812"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  It took LeBron James to help the Los Angeles Lakers snap a lengthy losing streak against Portland. James had 28 points and seven assists and the Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers 114-110 Saturday night. The Lakers snapped the franchise's 16-game losing streak against the Blazers. In addition to the streak, Saturday was the Lakers' first road win this season against a team with a winning record. ""Great to snap that,"" James said of the Lakers' streak of futility against Portland. ""They're a very good team, obviously. To beat Portland, you can't just come in and win without playing really hard and really well."" Rajon Rondo gave the Lakers a huge lift off the bench, finishing with 17 points and 10 assists in 25 minutes. Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum each scored 30 points for Portland. The Lakers used a 16-0 run in the third quarter to take a 17-point lead. Josh Hart hit a 3-pointer with 9:44 left that gave the Lakers their biggest lead at 95-75, forcing a Portland timeout. And the timeout might have been just what Portland needed to get back into the game. The Blazers went on a 22-8 run, cutting the Lakers' lead to six points with 3:34 left after a layup by Jusuf Nurkic. Sloppy play once again came back to hurt the Lakers in the fourth quarter, but the Blazers couldn't get much closer as James and JaVale McGee made crucial baskets in the final two minutes. ""LeBron closed them out over the final three minutes,"" Lakers head coach Luke Walton said of James. McGee, who James said is a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, also had six blocks to add to his league-leading total. ""He's doing a little bit of everything,"" James said of McGee. ""He's leading the league in blocks. And tonight he saved us and covered our defensive mistakes with blocks at the rim."" Portland shot a 6 for 35 (17 percent) from beyond the arc and shot just 42 percent from the field overall. ""Our defense won us the game tonight,"" Walton said. ""They missed some 3s, but we were contesting, chasing over the top and defending."" The Lakers had seven turnovers in the fourth quarter and finished with 20 overall, but they survived their mistakes. The Lakers sped to a good start, but the Blazers quickly regained control. Turnovers and second chances fueled a 17-2 run by Portland in the first quarter. The Lakers bench helped get Los Angeles back into the game in the first half and outscored the Blazers subs 51-26. ""Our second unit was outstanding tonight,"" Walton said. ""Rondo led it and then the lift that (Ivica) Zubac gave us off the bench was incredible."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Blazers head coach Terry Stotts says it's hard to get a handle for where his team really is on the defensive end due to the league's uptick in pace and scoring so far this season. ""It's hard to get a handle around the league where defense is,"" Stotts said. ""The numbers say we're 11th but it doesn't feel like it, but we are. I think this season has to settle in to see where we are with it. Unless you hold a team to 80 or 90 you'll always find things you have to get better at."" Lakers: Phoenix Suns center Tyson Chandler will join the Lakers once he clears waivers after agreeing to a contract buyout. A person with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the buyout plan to The Associated Press on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Suns had not yet revealed it publicly. While Lakers head coach Luke Walton dodged direct questions about the move, Stotts likes what Chandler brings to the table for the Lakers. Stotts coached Chandler in Dallas in 2011. ""I like Tyson Chandler,"" Stotts said. ""Great teammate, obviously that was a few years ago but he impacts the game at the defensive end. He's a great locker room guy, great teammate. He's all about winning. So, any team that has Tyson is going to be better for it.""","401070813"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo is taking his game to another level. He had his second triple-double this season with 26 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists to help the Milwaukee Bucks rout the Sacramento Kings 144-109 on Sunday. ""A great win for the team,"" Antetokounmpo said, deflecting any sense of personal satisfaction. ""When I drove the ball, they were wide open. I passed it, and they knocked down everything."" The Bucks improved to 8-1 -- the best nine-game start in franchise history. They set a season high for points in a game and also set the franchise record for 3s made with 22. Coach Mike Budenholzer was happy his team followed Antetokounmpo's lead. ""Hopefully, one of the keys to Giannis being great is everybody around him being great,"" the Bucks first-year coach said. ""We can also talk about a lot of other guys who played well, too. So, that's a great sign for Giannis and a great sign for us."" Seven other Bucks were in double figures. Eric Bledsoe scored 17, Ersan Ilyasova 15, Malcolm Brogdon and Pat Connaughton each had 13, Tony Snell and Khris Middleton each had 12 and John Henson 10. ""Coach Bud (head coach Mike Budenholzer) wants me to make plays and find them,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""That is what I am going to keep doing. It feels great."" Antetokounmpo completed the triple-double with his 10th assist when he found Connaughton in the corner for 3 and a 108-82 lead as time expired in the third quarter. Antetokounmpo finally went to the bench with 7:48 left in the fourth and the Bucks comfortably ahead 118-90. He pushed the lead to 78-54 with two thunderous dunks seconds apart in the third quarter. He slammed one home and then dunked again on a pass from Middleton after a turnover by De'Aaron Fox on the Kings' ensuing possession. Antetokounmpo's first triple-double came against the Philadelphia 76ers on Oct. 24th when he had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists. Justin Jackson set a career-high with 22 points, Buddy Hield had 19 and De'Aaron Fox 15 for the Kings who had their five-game winning streak snapped. Jackson felt the team was still upbeat despite the most lopsided loss this season. The Kings had lost 149-129 at New Orleans on Oct. 19. ""We just went 3-1 on a four-game road trip,"" Jackson said. ""Obviously, it hurts a little bit to lose like that, but I think we're extremely happy of how we played this road trip."" The Bucks started to take over with 12-2 run in the second quarter, keyed by seven points from Malcolm Brogdon, and led 72-48 on Ersan Ilyasova's 3 with 49 seconds left before the half. Ilyasova scored 15 points and Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe each added 13 as the Bucks surged to their best first half of scoring so far this season and led 72-50 heading into the third. Both teams let in fly from behind the arc. Milwaukee made 11 of 29 3-point attempts, including three by Ilyasova, to Sacramento's 6 for 19. TIP-INS Kings: Hield came in with five straight games of 20 or more points. ... Willie Cauley-Stein went to the bench with his fifth foul at 9:13 of the third. Bucks: G Sterling Brown was recalled from the Wisconsin Herd of the G League. The Bucks sent him to their affiliate to get some playing time. FROM BEYOND THE ARC The Bucks set a franchise high with 56 three-point attempts. ""Obviously, just to get up to 56 3-point attempts is a lot, but that's what they do,"" Kings head coach Dave Joerger said. ""They were effective."" STAT LINE The Bucks' 144 points are the team's most in a non-overtime game since scoring 147 against the San Antonio Spurs on March 18, 1979.","401070814"
"NEW YORK --  Nearly half the fourth quarter remained when 76ers coach Brett Brown pulled Joel Embiid from the game. Embiid wasn't helping, anyway. In the sloppiest performance in the NBA this season, Philadelphia threw the ball just about everywhere except to its All-Star center. D'Angelo Russell snapped out of a slump with 13 of his 21 points in the second half, and the Brooklyn Nets kept the 76ers winless on the road with a 122-97 victory on Sunday night. The 76ers committed 28 turnovers, most in the NBA this season, leading to 39 points for the Nets. ""That is not who we are,"" Brown said. ""And I give credit to Brooklyn, but that is an unacceptable performance."" Brown added that the 76ers weren't currently among the elite in the Eastern Conference, and his players didn't argue after they fell to 0-5 away from home. They are 6-0 in Philadelphia. ""We've been playing soft,"" said guard Ben Simmons, adding an expletive to describe the team's play. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson also scored 21 points and Caris LeVert had 20 for the Nets. They took a small lead into halftime thanks to 17 Philadelphia turnovers, then blew it open with a 41-point third quarter that was one of the biggest in Barclays Center history. They kept pouring it on in the fourth and Brown removed Embiid and Simmons facing a 24-point deficit. ""I would say turning the ball over a lot of the time is being lackadaisical or trying to force something that isn't there,"" Russell said. ""I think everybody was aggressive tonight, 1 through 5."" Embiid finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds but got only eight shots a day after going for 39 points and 17 rebounds in a victory over Detroit. Simmons had 20 points and 12 boards. ""It's not Golden State. We shouldn't lose a game to Brooklyn by that many points,"" Embiid said. ""We didn't compete."" Russell was only 4 for 12 for eight points in the first half, a game after the former No. 2 pick sat the entire fourth quarter in the Nets' loss to Houston after going 5 for 14. But he had nine points in the third and he was only on the bench as the final minutes ticked down this time because there was no crunch time. Joe Harris snapped a 61-all tie with a 3-pointer, Russell scored five straight and Harris made another 3 to make it 72-61. JJ Redick scored to end that drought but it didn't change the momentum, as the Nets scored 15 of the next 21 points to open an 87-69 lead. The 76ers limited the Nets to 5-of-28 shooting in the first quarter but led only 21-18 in part because of their 10 turnovers. Philadelphia coughed it up seven more times in the second and the Nets led 51-47 at halftime. TIP-INS 76ers: Wilson Chandler rested a day after making his 76ers debut following a strained left hamstring by playing 10 minutes. ... Philadelphia had a three-game winning streak against Brooklyn snapped. Nets: Brooklyn improved to 9-4 against Philadelphia at Barclays Center, tied for the most victories against any opponent since moving from New Jersey. The Nets have also beaten Orlando nine times. ... Jarrett Allen had 15 points and 10 rebounds. SHOOTING STREAK Harris made a 3-pointer in his 25th straight game, moving into sole possession of fourth place on the Nets' career list. Joe Johnson hit at least one in 37 in a row in 2014. FAMILIAR FACES The Nets have used the same starting five (LeVert, Russell, Harris, Jared Dudley and Allen) for each of the first 10 games of the season. The last time they did that was in the 2002-03 season, when Jason Kidd, Kerry Kittles, Richard Jefferson, Kenyon Martin and Dikembe Mutombo started the first 16 in a row. BIG THREE The 41-point third quarter was one off the Nets' high in Barclays Center, which opened in 2012. They had a 42-point third against Golden State last season and against the 76ers on Dec. 16, 2013.","401070815"
"WASHINGTON -- The Washington Wizards entered their game against the New York Knicks with the NBA's worst defense and mired in a five-game losing streak. In eight games, the Wizards had given up an average of nearly 124 points. That led Washington coach Scott Brooks to make a wry observation: ""We're leading a lot of the categories in the wrong way.'' Things turned around on Sunday as John Wall scored 26 points, Bradley Beal added 22 and the Wizards defeated the Knicks 108-95. The win left Brooks sounding a bit more upbeat when asked what he most liked about the game. ""That I didn't see triple digits,'' Brooks said. ""It was nice to see it below 100.'' After the Knicks cut a 13-point lead in the third quarter and tied the score for the third time at 86-all with 9:13 to play, Washington held New York to just nine points. Markieff Morris had 16 points and Jeff Green scored 14 for Washington, which won for the second time in nine games. ""I don't know what sparked it, but that's what we needed,'' Beal said. ""It was put together for the whole 48 minutes for the first time. In games past, we'd play a good first half or a good second half.'' The Knicks, who fell to 3-7, were led by Enes Kanter's 18 points and 12 rebounds. Trey Burke had 13 points. Washington forced 20 New York turnovers. That was a season high for the Wizards. ""We were very careless with the ball tonight, and they deserve a lot of credit for that,'' Knicks coach David Fizdale said. TIP-INS Knicks: F Kevin Knox missed his seventh game with a sprained left ankle. Knox thinks he's ready to play. Fizdale isn't so sure. ""He's not making the diagnosis -- my 19-year-old rookie. I told him I want him to play 5-on-5 first. I know he feels great, but at the same time we have to be sure.'' ... G Courtney Lee has yet to play this year with neck spasms. ""I couldn't [give an estimate],'' Fizdale said. ""I have no idea. I'm hoping soon, just for his sake. He's been such a pro, and he's been really engaged, but I know it's killing him.'' G Tim Hardaway was held to seven points in 24 minutes. He suffered a back injury in the first quarter but returned to the game. Wizards: F Otto Porter was out with a bruised left big toe. Brooks said the injury was day-to-day and didn't know if Porter would practice Monday. ... Wall hit three 3-pointers. He has 500 in his career. ... C Dwight Howard was assessed a flagrant-1 foul when he attempted to block Kanter's shot midway through the second quarter. SMILING HOWARD Howard scored 10 points and had 10 rebounds in 31 minutes in his second game. He missed the first seven games with a sore backside. ""If you want me to judge him after two games, he did pretty good,'' Brooks said. ""I like his enthusiasm. I like his smile. He's a good-looking guy, and he uses it all the time.'' Howard said the smiling was a sign of weakness. ""I was smiling because I was saying, 'Damn, I can't get off the ground tonight.''' Brooks called a play for Howard to catch a lob. ""I was like, 'Coach, my legs are not there, yet, so I have to keep smiling my way through it.'"" TECH TALK Besides Howard's flagrant, New York C Mitchell Robinson was called for a technical. Wall and Knicks G Allonzo Trier were called for a double technical. ""It's important that they're not going to back down from anybody,'' Hardaway said. ""They don't care who it is. I'm happy they did that. If I was in that situation, I probably would have gotten thrown out the game.'' 3-POINT WOES Washington limited New York to 5-for-27 shooting on 3-pointers (18.5 percent). In their first eight games, the Wizards gave up at least 10 3s. ""We treated everybody as a hot player, no matter who he was,'' Brooks said.","401070816"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Orlando Magic's best victory of the season was almost their most deflating loss. Aaron Gordon scored 26 points and Orlando held on to beat the San Antonio Spurs 117-110 on Sunday night after nearly blowing a 26-point lead with 9 minutes remaining. D.J Augustin added 18 points for Orlando, which made 12 3-pointers in scoring a season high. ""It's a great feeling to get a good win on the road against a great team like that who's playing well now,"" Augustin said. ""It's great for our confidence it's what we've been looking for to get us going in a good direction."" DeMar DeRozan had 25 points as San Antonio's four-game winning streak came to an end on the second night of a back-to-back. ""No excuses, everyone has back-to-backs,"" said Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge who added 14 points.  We just came in and we didn't play as good at defense as we can. We'll get better and be better at it next game. Orlando snapped a four-game skid, but had to bring its starters back into the game to preserve the victory. The Spurs went on a 25-6 run over 6 minutes to erase the Magic's 105-79 with 9:02 remaining and close within five points with less than 2 minutes left. ""We can't let go, we can't take our foot of the gas,"" Gordon said. ""You've got to be able to finish thoroughly or teams will come back."" San Antonio veteran Pau Gasol sparked the run by blocking and collecting Gordon's shot and racing downcourt, where he was fouled with 7 minutes remaining. Gasol's hustle led Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to reinsert DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes back into the game despite Orlando leading by 18 points. The Spurs responded with a 9-2 run to pull within 107-96 with 5:28 remaining and forced Magic coach Steve Clifford to take a timeout to slow the momentum. Clifford was forced to take another timeout 2 1/2 minutes later when Bryn Forbes' 3-pointer cut Orlando's lead to 111-104. ""We had the game at a place where were ahead by enough and that's where we stopped playing defense and they took advantage of it,"" Clifford said. ""That three-minute stretch in the fourth quarter, where they were good and we lost our concentration, except for that, I thought our defense was good all night."" Gasol's 3-pointer pulled the Spurs within 113-108 with 1:41 remaining, but the Magic were able to salvage the win and preserve their best offensive performance of the season. Orlando failed to score 100 points in its three previous games, but jumped out to an early lead. ""They deserve a lot of credit,"" Popovich said. ""They were really efficient offensively and haven't been all year. They've been at the bottom of the league in offensive efficiency and a lot of it is because it's a new system."" Mills finished with 16 points and Gasol finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes. Terrence Ross added 17 points off the bench for Orlando. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando entered the game last in the league in scoring at 99.9 points per game as well as field goal percentage at 41.4. ... Former Spurs forward Jonathon Simmons received a warm ovation upon entering the game late in the first quarter. Simmons, who was listed as questionable with bruised right wrist, had no points in 18 minutes. ... Jonathan Isaac did not play due to a sprained right ankle. ... Timofey Mozgov missed the game with sore right knee. Spurs: Jakob Poeltl played 14 minutes, including starting the second half. It was the most minutes Poeltl has played since logging 13 minutes against Indiana on Oct. 24. He finished with two points and five rebounds. . Marco Belinelli finished with 15 points, one shy of his season high. Belinelli was 2 for 5 on 3-pointers. ADAPTING DeRozan is averaging 1.1 steals per game, which matches his career high, and is on pace to collect the most steals in his career in a season. DeRozan is adapting to the Spurs' defensive system and has collected most of his nine steals by stepping into passing lanes. ""It's got nothing to with me or what I'm doing,"" Popovich said. ""He's a good basketball player. He's been an All-Star for I don't know how many years. He does all those things. He's a very good player."" BUSY NIGHT Rudy Gay missed his first game of the season, sitting out due to right heel soreness. Popovich downplayed the severity of the injury by saying Gay was sitting out because ""he has other things to do.""","401070817"
"PHOENIX --  The Phoenix Suns were locked in their tightest game of the season, and Devin Booker made good on his chance to get his struggling team a much-needed win. Booker's 17-foot jumper with 1.7 seconds left capped a fourth-quarter comeback by Phoenix, and the Suns snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 102-100 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday night. Booker, playing the entire fourth quarter with five fouls, scored 14 of his game high 25 points in the final period as Phoenix rallied from 12 points down for their second victory of the season. Trevor Ariza added 16 points and nine rebounds, and rookie Mikal Bridges scored nine of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. ""We've been stressing that if we get a win, it will change the energy around here,"" Booker said. ""Hopefully, this win will give us some new life."" Shelvin Mack's season-high 21 points led the Grizzlies, who got one more possession after Booker's big bucket. But Mike Conley missed a long 3-pointer at the horn. ""They did a good job just switching out. That was kind of tough with one second left,"" Mack said of Conley's shot. ""Coaches drew the play up and he had a chance to make it ... it just didn't go in tonight."" Dillon Brooks scored a season-high 17 points for Memphis, including eight in the fourth quarter. Brooks' layup with 8:39 to play gave the Grizzlies a 91-79 lead. The Suns chipped away until finally taking the lead. ""We didn't get enough easy shots towards the end,"" Brooks said. ""We weren't moving the ball, driving and attacking. We got a little stagnant."" The leading scorers for both teams were saddled with foul trouble. Conley picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter, and Booker was whistled for his fifth midway through the third quarter. Isaiah Canaan hit a 3 that gave Phoenix a 61-56 lead in the third period, the Suns' largest lead of the game. The Grizzlies responded with an 18-2 run and took a 74-63 lead. The Suns went almost four minutes without a point in the quarter. Phoenix cut the Grizzlies' lead to 81-77 at the end of the third, thanks to Jamal Crawford's 33-foot heave that swished through the net. Marshon Brooks followed his own missed free throw and gave the Grizzlies a 10-point lead, 47-37, with 4:15 left in the second quarter. The Grizzlies' largest lead of the first half was 10 points. Booker knocked down his first 3 after four misses with 46.5 seconds left in the second, and followed that with a lob to Deandre Ayton with 2.9 seconds. The Suns trailed 56-52 at the break. ""It wasn't a perfect game by any means, but we needed this one,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We needed this one as a group, as a unit, for many, many reasons."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: The Grizzlies' three-game win streak came to an end. ... F Chandler Parsons missed his fifth straight game with right knee soreness. ... F Kyle Anderson scored a season high 10. Suns: A day after sending him to G League affiliate Northern Arizona, the Suns recalled G De'Anthony Melton in time for Sunday's game. ... Crawford played in his 1,270th game, and moved into a tie with John Havlicek for 29th in NBA history. ... The Suns won despite a season high 25 turnovers. MOVING ON The Suns and Tyson Chandler Sunday reached an agreement to buy out the veteran center's contract, and the team requested waivers on Chandler. Vice president of basketball operations James Jones said the move gives Chandler, who played 166 games over four seasons with Phoenix, the chance to pursue a new opportunity while allowing the Suns' younger players to continue to develop. ""Nothing but a great experience to coach him, ""Kokoskov said. OUCH! Ariza was inadvertently hit in the groin area on the last play of the first quarter by Conley, and the end result was Wayne Selden's 3 at the buzzer that counted and gave Memphis a 28-21 lead. Ariza doubled over in pain, but was on the court to start the second quarter.","401070818"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Life is good for the Portland Trail Blazers 10 games into the season. Jusuf Nurkic had 19 points and 12 rebounds and led the Trail Blazers to a 111-81 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. to improve to 7-3 on the season. ""When everything go well, it go well,"" Nurkic said after the win pushed the Blazers to 7-3. ""We came ready after back-to-back and a bad loss."" Blazers star guard Damian Lillard said the team's start likely has surprised some. ""To be sitting where we are now, I'm sure people didn't expect it,"" Lillard said. ""I think we're playing good basketball. We've been pretty consistent with the things that we need to do to win games and it's showing."" Meyers Leonard had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. Following a game Saturday in which their bench struggled against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Trail Blazers' reserves bounced back Sunday and outscored the Wolves subs 44-23. ""I was happy for Meyers,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of his reserve big man. ""Got a little chant going, that was fun. I thought in the first half he played very well."" Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 23 points for Minnesota. It was his fourth straight game scoring 20 points or more. But scoring was not the issue for the Wolves on Sunday, as the Blazers got plenty of points at the free-throw line. ""Defensively, the penetration really hurt us,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Portland, the league's best free-throw shooting team, took advantage of its free-throw attempts in the first two quarters for a 61-45 halftime lead. In the game, the Trail Blazers shot 28 for 32 from the line. The Blazers continued the onslaught in the third quarter, pushing their lead to as many as 28 points. For the second straight game, the Blazers struggled from beyond the arc (7 for 28), but it didn't matter against the Wolves. The timeout helped as Minnesota stormed back, even taking a brief two-point lead on a 3-pointer from rookie guard Josh Okogie. Portland, however, took control of the game on the strength of their subs. Towns already had his knees wrapped up before the 4th quarter even started, knowing his night was over. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: In each of last three seasons, Portland's CJ McCollum has averaged over 20 points per game. But despite a league-wide scoring boom, McCollum has actually seen his scoring average drop to 19 points. While McCollum is sacrificing some individual glory, the Blazers have a 7-3 record and entered Sunday with the third-ranked offense in the NBA. ""I think obviously having Evan (Turner) out there with them, playing more minutes with Damian (Lillard) affects how much the ball is in his hands. His numbers are probably down a little bit but not significantly,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of the adjustment for McCollum. ""The emphasis this year was, again, passing and incorporating the team more and less off the dribble. That's how we are playing right now. I think everybody was on the same page. Not just talking to him but to everybody."" Timberwolves: Disgruntled Wolves forward Jimmy Butler sat out of Sunday night's game in Portland, due to what the team deemed ""precautionary rest."" Butler did not play in the Wolves game Wednesday, but did play Friday at Golden State Thibodeau did confirm to reporters before the game that Butler was with the team, clearly trying to downplay Butler's absence in light of the star forward's trade request. The Wolves were also without point guard Derrick Rose on Sunday, who was a late-scratch after being deemed a game-time decision by his coach.","401070819"
"LOS ANGELES --  Serge Ibaka outscored the Lakers by himself in the first quarter, and he didn't miss a shot until the third. He beat LA inside and outside on the way to the biggest offensive game of his career. Thanks to Ibaka's brilliance for the Toronto Raptors, Kawhi Leonard wasn't missed by anyone except the Lakers fans who might have been hoping to entice him home. Ibaka made his first 14 shots on the way to a career-high 34 points, and the Raptors didn't need an injured Leonard in a 121-107 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday night. Ibaka had 10 rebounds and didn't miss a shot until 5:16 remained in the third quarter, finishing 15 of 17. He was overpowering while the Raptors jumped to a stunning 31-point lead in the first quarter, and he returned in the final minutes to close out Toronto's eighth consecutive win over the Lakers. ""I was just focused,"" Ibaka said. ""I knew Kawhi was out tonight, so I just wanted to go out there and do my best."" With the Lakers' small lineups struggling to contain Ibaka early on, he became the first player to start a game 14 of 14 from the field since Shaquille O'Neal did it in February 2006, according to the NBA. ""That's pretty cool,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""The best thing is he's doing it with some real good composure. He's getting in there and taking his time. He's using his size, his power, and using pretty good footwork, so it's something we can go to."" Kyle Lowry added 21 points and 15 assists for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who haven't lost to the Lakers since 2014. ""We really wanted to put some pressure on them and guard the ball,"" Nurse said. ""We got off to an unbelievable start. We looked athletic and fast all over the place tonight."" Toronto didn't let its huge lead dwindle significantly until the final minutes, when the Lakers' youngster got the margin down to 117-107 with LeBron James on the bench. Toronto was forced to re-insert its starters in the final minutes to preserve the win. ""They've been playing like they're the best team in the Eastern Conference so far,"" said James, who finished with 18 points and six assists. ""They just came out and hit us right in the mouth, and it's going to be very hard to make a game of that when you're trying to expend so much energy to get back into it."" Kyle Kuzma scored 24 points and Brandon Ingram added 16 for the Lakers, who are 4-6 after their first 10 games with James after this defeat on the tail end of a back-to-back set that began with a gritty win in Portland on Saturday night. ""In my experience, unfortunately, most of the time when a player like Kawhi sits out, that team ends up winning,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""There's a sense of freedom and joy that comes when a top player like that is out. We tried to explain that that's part of how this works, but it doesn't seem like we took that to heart."" TIP-INS Raptors: Leonard has sat out three of his first 10 games with Toronto, missing two games last month to manage his workload coming back from last season's injury struggles. He injured his foot late in the Raps' win at Phoenix on Friday night. Nurse doesn't know whether Leonard will play Monday at Utah. ... OG Anunoby took Leonard's spot in the starting lineup and contributed seven points.

The Lakers would love to sign a second superstar like Leonard, who grew up in the Inland Empire area, one hour east of Los Angeles. BAD START The Lakers' first quarter was shockingly bad. Toronto took a 41-10 lead with 2:21 still remaining in the first quarter, and Ibaka outscored the Lakers 20-17 in the opening period. Ibaka went 11 for 11 in the first half, while Lowry had 12 assists as the Raptors hit six 3-pointers and forced nine turnovers.","401070820"
"DETROIT --  Minus their big man, the Miami Heat were looking for someone to come up big. Josh Richardson answered the call. The 6-foot-6 shooting guard scored 27 points to lead the short-handed Heat past the Detroit Pistons 120-115 in overtime Monday night. Richardson hit four free throws in the final 2.1 seconds to clinch it, ending Miami's three-game skid. Detroit has dropped five in a row. ""I was just being aggressive,"" Richardson said. ""I think I had a little lull in the fourth. I was just trying to get back and help us win. I was just taking my shots."" The Heat played without center Hassan Whiteside, who is second in the NBA in rebounding (14.6 per game) and blocked shots (2.75). Whiteside missed the game with an injured right knee. Richardson had nine of Miami's 15 points in overtime. It's the third time in four games he's put up at least 25, and the Heat can sense the fourth-year player growing into a role as their go-to scorer. ""It's the first time he's been called on to do this,"" Miami guard Dwyane Wade said. ""The shots he was taking in overtime and making, those were big-time shots. We want him to have the confidence to continue to take it to the next level, because we're going to need it."" Richardson sought to downplay his success, both on this night and in the bigger picture. ""There's not really a defined go-to guy on our team,"" he said. ""Anybody on our team can hurt you late. ""If I get the ball, it happens to find me late, if guys give me the ball, I'll definitely take that on. But I think we have a lot of guys who are very confident."" Kelly Olynyk, filling Whiteside's spot on the floor, scored 10 of his 13 points in the second half. Goran Dragic had 21 points and Wade, playing his farewell NBA season, contributed 18 off the bench. Andre Drummond had 25 points for Detroit, and the NBA rebounding leader pulled down 24 boards. It was a putback by Drummond with 0.5 seconds left on the clock that sent the game to overtime. ""Drummond was tremendous on the glass,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Every time we had a stop, or had bodies in front of the ball, he just has an incredible knack of second and third efforts. ""For a guy his size, the touch that he has to tip the ball in is pretty remarkable."" Reggie Jackson scored 25 and Langston Galloway added 21 off the bench. Blake Griffin, second in the league in scoring, had 24 points before fouling out in the fourth quarter. ""It is on us to continue to improve,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I know it's not showing in the record, but I do see improvement."" WADE A MINUTE So often a Detroit nemesis during his career, Wade was booed by Pistons fans who mocked him with chants of ""MVP!"" after he missed a free throw in the final minute of the first half. Wade, who has never won the NBA MVP award, responded to the taunting with a thunderous slam that tied the score at 51, one of three dunks he had in the game. ""I went to hot yoga this morning,"" Wade said. ""I think it was the yoga."" After the game, a throng of fans holding Wade's No. 3 Heat jersey awaited him as he left the court. ""I definitely have always got a lot of love and respect here,"" Wade said. ""I got some boos and some other words here, too. That's just the game of basketball.""

"INDIANAPOLIS --  James Harden produced his typical scoring flurry Monday night. His teammates delivered the knockout blow with a staunch second-half defensive effort. On a night the league's reigning MVP made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 36.1 seconds left and closed it out by making four straight free throws, Harden was thrilled to see the Houston Rockets rediscover their winning combination in a 98-94 victory at Indiana. ""We're doing a really good job of getting stops and making it hard for teams to score,"" he said. ""I'm not worried about our offense. We're a really good offensive team. We're going to make shots. We need a pretty good defensive effort (each night)."" The message seems to have sunk in. While Harden did his usual work with 28 points, six assists and five 3-pointers, the improving defense and a healthier roster has helped last season's Western Conference runner-ups punch their way out of an early-season corner. Since starting 1-5, Houston has won three straight -- all on the road, the last two without the benefit of hitting 100 points. And more help appears to be on the way. Officially, the Rockets say they are finalizing the details on a deal to bring back defensive guru Jeff Bzdelik. Unofficially, it looks all but done. ""Just really happy he's coming back,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game. ""It's great. We can pick up where we left off."" What Bzdelik will find is a team ready and willing to fight hard as it did again Monday. After trailing for most of the second and third quarters, they finally rallied behind Harden in the fourth quarter and closed it out by shutting down the Pacers. Victor Oladipo finished with 28 points and made two 3s in the final minute to trim the deficit to 94-93 with 24.7 seconds to go, but the Rockets didn't give up another basket as the Pacers' three-game winning streak ended. ""We still gave ourselves a chance to win, we just came up short,"" Oladipo said. ""The beauty of it is there is another game on Wednesday."" The Rockets have won three straight in the series though this one required everything they could muster. When P.J. Tucker and Carmelo Anthony knocked down back-to-back 3s midway through the fourth quarter, the Rockets were finally tied at 81. Chris Paul broke the tie with a layup and Harden added a free throw when Pacers coach Nate McMillan was called for a technical foul. Indiana spent the rest of the 's 3-pointer rattled in with 7:28 left and Carmelo Anthony followed Tucker's basket with another 3, the Rockets tied it at 81. Chris Paul broke the tie with a layup and Harden made a free throw after Pacers coach Nate McMillan drew a technical foul with 4:38 to go. Oladipo tied the score at 90 with the first of his two threes in the final minute, but Harden broke the tie with the last of his 3s, Paul made 1 of 2 free throw to make it 94-90 and Harden closed it out at the free-throw line. ""It was just a good, spirited win,"" D'Antoni said. ""Those are the ones, until we iron some stuff out, we have to (win), and we haven't been doing that."" TIP-INS Rockets: Clint Capela had 18 points and 10 rebounds for his sixth consecutive double-double, a career best. ... Paul took only three shots in a scoreless first half and wound up with nine points and 13 assists. ...... The Rockets were 15 of 47 on 3s and improved to 4-0 this season when outrebounding opponents.

Bojan Bogdanovic and Tyreke Evans scored 11 points. Thaddeus Young finished with eight points and 11 rebounds. IN SYNC McMillan is still working to get his offense get in sync. He would like to see better ball movement and a quicker tempo, both facets that could have helped against the Rockets. But he wasn't trying to take a cue from their usually high-scoring opponent. ""We don't want to just get into a run-and-gun game and make it a shootout,"" McMillan said. ""If we have something early (in the possession), we'll take it. If not we want to make them defend it.""","401070822"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Evan Fournier has struggled with his jump shot early this season. He got a big one to go down Monday night, though. The seventh-year swingman hit a 22-footer at the final horn and the Orlando Magic came back from a five-point deficit in the last 24 seconds, taking advantage of a late collapse by Cleveland in a 102-100 victory over the scuffling Cavaliers. Fournier took an inbounds pass with 1.8 seconds left after Nikola Vucevic blocked George Hill's shot at the other end, and the ball went out of bounds off Hill. ""I finished well shooting the ball, but I missed so many open shots in the first half and third quarter, it's amazing,"" Fournier said. ""I knew (the last shot) wasn't going to be catch-and-shoot situation because that's a tough shot. ... I knew I had time to dribble."" J.R. Smith's 3-pointer with 41.9 seconds remaining had given the Cavaliers a 100-95 lead until Aaron Gordon scored after an offensive rebound for the Magic with 23.8 seconds to go. D.J. Augustin made a steal and two free throws with 18.7 seconds left to trim the deficit to one. Kyle Korver then lost the ball to Fournier, who hit one of two free throws with 13 seconds on the clock to tie it at 100. ""We had to steal the ball, execute, and really win a game you're not supposed to when you're down whatever with 15 seconds left,"" Fournier said. ""Most of the time you don't win those games."" Gordon scored 23 points for Orlando, while Fournier and Terrence Ross had 15 each. Fournier added three steals, including that critical one in the final seconds while the Cavaliers were trying to protect a one-point lead. Hill scored 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter and made 10 of 12 shots for Cleveland (1-9), which remained winless on the road. Tristan Thompson added 19 points and 16 rebounds. ""It was real tough, but the good part about it is the way we competed,"" said Smith, who had 14 points. ""Mistakes were made, but to see the way we played together defensively and executing on offense was inspiring to watch."" Vucevic scored the final six points of the first half, including a putback with 1.4 seconds left, to leave Orlando (4-6) with a 58-47 halftime lead -- the largest of the game for either team. Cleveland answered with 11 straight points early in the third quarter and pulled ahead 71-68 on a 3-pointer by Hill. Hill and Smith combined for nine points and Jordan Clarkson converted a four-point play as the Cavaliers finished the period on a 15-2 run to lead 79-70. But they didn't finish it. In the last 20 seconds they had two turnovers, and their only shot was blocked. ""We put ourselves in a great situation and we just did not execute down the stretch,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""When situations come up like that, you have to know what to do and execute. We didn't handle it and that is why we lost the game."" JOB REPORT Drew, promoted to head coach when the Cavaliers fired Tyronn Lue on Oct. 25, reached an agreement to remain the head coach for the rest of the season.

But, his foul sent a driving LaVine to the line for the winning free throw. ""I love the attack on that last possession to get to the free-throw line, which was obviously needed,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg. ""Our guys needed to get a close one. The guys hung tough and they stuck together. We found a way to get it.""

The Thunder led 84-77 when he left the game with 4:25 left in the third quarter. There was limited information on Westbrook's status after the game. ""We'll see,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Generally, with those things, we'll see how he does in the morning. But it's a sprained ankle. Hopefully, he'll be OK.""

"Kyrie Irving expresses his frustrations with Jamal Murray's last-second shot, saying the ball ""deserves to go into the crowd"" after a move like that. (0:50) DENVER --  Jamal Murray simply got caught up in the moment when he hoisted a long shot with the clock winding down. He took some heat for it. No disrespect meant, he maintained. Murray scored a career-high 48 points, including 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Denver Nuggets overcame a sluggish start to beat the Boston Celtics 115-107 on Monday night. The point guard knew he was on from his first jumper -- a deep 3-pointer. He realized he might have ruffled some feathers with his last -- an even deeper 3 in an effort to score 50. ""My emotion took over as it normally does when I get going like that,"" Murray explained. Murray was feeling it all night, hitting 19 of 30 shots, including five 3s. He had two attempts to reach 50 points in the final seconds, but missed a reverse layup and then that 3 at the buzzer -- one that bothered the Celtics with the game already decided. ""What kind of competitor wouldn't it bother? I was (mad), but we're not going to make a big thing about it,"" said Kyrie Irving, who scored 31 points on 13-of-17 shooting. ""But congratulations to him on 48 points. He did it in a great fashion."" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said the veterans on his team talked to Murray about the late shot. ""He's young. He's still learning,"" Malone said. ""You never want to try to disrespect anybody. It wasn't disrespect. He was trying to get to 50 points."" At 9-1, the Nuggets are earning a measure of respect around the NBA as they're off to their best start since 1976-77. They're 6-0 at home, including wins over Golden State and now Boston. ""We've accomplished nothing,"" Murray said. ""Keep trusting each other and get the job done."" Denver spotted the Celtics an 18-point lead in the first quarter but quickly made up ground behind Murray, who scored 23 in the first half. In a matchup between two of the league's top defenses, it was offense that ruled on this night. More specifically, Murray. He took over the game in the fourth quarter, hitting a pair of 3-pointers to give the Nuggets some breathing room. The Celtics even tried to double-team him. It didn't work. ""He was rolling,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He got a couple of easy ones out of the gate that I think made him feel good. He deserves credit."" The Nuggets needed a big game from Murray because the Celtics found some rhythm. Malone knew it was just a matter of time before a streaky Boston offense started consistently knocking down jumpers. He was just hoping it would happen after Monday. ""Their offense is trending in the right direction,"" Malone said. ""Couple that with their defense, which can be suffocating at times, and that's what makes them such a dangerous team -- a team that's going to go very, very deep in the playoffs.""

""I can't say enough great things about him and all the things that he has meant to the Celtics, Celtic fans in and around New England and even in our house,"" Stevens said. ""He's an absolute pleasure to be around."" Thomas isn't expected back until possibly next month, but he's already having an influence on the Nuggets -- with his voice. ""We have a relatively quiet group and one thing that everybody knows that's been around Isaiah is that he's not quiet,"" Malone said. ""He brings an energy and a voice and a leadership that we sorely miss."" LESSON LEARNED Morris believes Murray learned his lesson about shooting with a game in hand. ""I know him personally. It was unprofessional,"" Morris said. ""He's a young player. He'll learn.""","401070826"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Without Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors used a balanced team effort to get their fourth straight win. ""We have been playing basically position-less basketball,"" said Kyle Lowry, who had 17 points and 11 assists to lead four Raptors with 17 points as Toronto beat the Utah Jazz 124-111 on Monday night. Serge Ibaka, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet also had 17 points as the Raptors were bolstered with six players in double figures to win their fourth straight game. ""Tonight was how our offense is supposed to be played,"" VanVleet said. ""As long as we're making shots, their defense has to respect the shooters and it allows us to play with more freedom out there."" The matchup lost some luster -- and nearly 49 points a game -- when Utah's Donovan Mitchell was ruled out with a left ankle sprain and Toronto's Leonard sat with a sore left ankle as well. But the Raptors didn't miss a beat and their offensive spacing left the court wide-open for drives. ""Nobody likes to play in tight spaces, in congested spaces, so with an offense full of shooters, it's open and it's fun out there,"" VanVleet said. Ibaka made all eight of his shots and has made 27 of his last 29 attempts. ""The guy is hot,"" Lowry said of Ibaka but he could have said it about a half-dozen Raptors. The point guard is certainly finding his shooters and has now posted nine consecutive games with 10 or more assists. Alec Burks led Utah with 22 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 12 rebounds. After the game, Burks was so disgusted he said he had nothing to say to the media despite his scoring outburst. The Raptors broke the game open with a 15-3 run that bridged the second and third quarter. The spurt was capped when Danny Green hit a 3-pointer to make it 71-55 for Toronto, which stretched the lead to as many as 26 early in the final period. The last time the Jazz lost four in a row at home was in the 2013-14 season when they went 25-57. ""The little things that made us so good last year -- we haven't really done any of them to this point,"" Joe Ingles said. The Jazz got to the basket time and again but couldn't finish as the Raptors challenged them at the 3-point arc. Utah shot 8-of-31 from 3-point range, but that was skewed by the Jazz making three 3s in garbage time. Despite a 21-5 deficit in free throw attempts in the first half, the Raptors made eight 3s and shot 63 percent from the field to lead 65-54 at the break. HOME COOKING? The Jazz haven't started 0-4 at home since their inaugural season in New Orleans in 1974-75. That season, the Jazz played in the Municipal Auditorium, and lost their first six home games before finally beating Portland behind Pete Maravich's 30 points. COACH SEAT Rick Pitino, who was fired in 2017 as Louisville's head coach, took in the game from a courtside seat within earshot of Utah coach Quin Synder. Pitino, who coached Mitchell at Louisville, was accompanied by Utah Valley University coach Mark Pope who was on his 1996 Kentucky NCAA Championship team. TIP-INS Raptors: Norman Powell left the game with a sprained shoulder and went straight to the locker room with 9:46 left in the second quarter. He did not return and will be evaluated on Tuesday. ... Lowry, after multiple spirited conversations with the officials, got a technical late in the third quarter. ... The Raptors outscored the jazz by 29 points in the 29 minutes Lowry was on the court. Jazz: Ingles dislocated his finger with 6:17 left in the game and did not return. ... Utah went 27-for-41 from the line while Toronto made 13 of their 14 attempts. ... Ricky Rubio had nine assists but shot 1-for-10.","401070827"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Golden State Warriors delivered one of those high-flying third quarters that were a signature last season. Stephen Curry capped it with a rare but dazzling block. ""We'll have to start calling him a rim protector now,"" Kevin Durant quipped. Klay Thompson scored 27 points, Durant added 22 points, six rebounds and six assists, and the Warriors pulled away after halftime to run their winning streak to eight games with a 117-101 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. Curry overcame a slow start to score 19 points, and the Warriors used a 34-15 third quarter to pull away. That marked a season-low scoring total for any quarter by the Grizzlies. At 10-1, the Warriors are off to the second-best start in franchise history behind the team of three years ago that began 24-0. The 1960-61 Philadelphia Warriors were 9-0 before losing four straight. Thompson's contested 3 moments before the halftime buzzer sent the teams into intermission tied at 58, then the Warriors took off the way they do resemblant of their signature third quarters last season. ""I think the second half we picked the pace up, got out in transition and that opens up the floor for everybody,"" Thompson said. Curry's 3-pointer with 3:14 left in the third put the Warriors up by 10, 81-71, before Durant followed with back-to-back jumpers. Curry swatted a shot by Wayne Selden to end the third, sending the two-time defending champions into a frenzy. ""That was impressive,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""I was hoping for the (Dikembe) Mutombo finger wag. Didn't quite get it."" Curry shot 1 of 7 in the opening quarter with a single 3 accounting for his point total. Draymond Green was limited to just fewer than 14 minutes because of a bruised right foot. X-rays were negative, Kerr said. Dillon Brooks came off the bench to score 11 of his 18 points in the first quarter to help the Grizzlies take a 31-29 lead. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Shelvin Mack scored 15 apiece for Memphis. Marc Gasol had eight points with just a pair of field goals to go with 10 rebounds and nine assists for Memphis in its first set of 13 back-to-backs this season. Alfonzo McKinnie scored 14 points off the bench for the Warriors, who have won 13 of the last 17 meetings with Memphis and four straight at home. ""It's a snowball effect of things,"" Memphis guard Mike Conley said. ""When they get a couple good looks, a couple easy shots to fall, it's contagious and everybody else kind of feeds off it."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis shot 45.8 percent. The Grizzlies came into the game shooting 53 percent at home to just 40.2 away, but had gone 49 percent from the floor in two games to begin this current road trip at Utah and Phoenix. ... F Ivan Rabb scored four points over nine minutes in his return home to the East Bay where he attended Bishop O'Dowd High and the University of California. ... The Grizzlies have committed fewer turnovers than opponents in each of their initial nine games. ... Memphis last won at Oracle 128-119 in overtime on Jan. 6, 2017. Warriors: Curry had his fourth block of the season and No. 133 of his career. ... G Shaun Livingston missed his fifth straight game and seventh in the last nine with a sore right foot, while fellow key reserve Andre Iguodala was out for rest. ... Coming off a game they outrebounded the Timberwolves 61-39, Golden State held another lopsided advantage on the glass: 46-30. CASSPI'S CONTRIBUTIONS Omri Casspi missed the game against his old team because of a sore right knee but received his championship ring from Warriors general manager Bob Myers during a pregame ceremony for his contributions with the two-time defending champions during the regular season. He wasn't on the playoff roster. ""I'm really thankful for the class act by the Warriors,"" Casspi said. ""We all know how grateful I am for that. I'm happy to be a part of that, I'm happy to be a part of the team that won the championship. Obviously I missed the playoffs. I wanted to be there so bad. It's natural."" Even though he was waived by Golden State ahead of the start of the postseason to make roster room for guard Quinn Cook, Casspi played a key role and the Warriors honored him with a video tribute. ""Just difficult circumstances that led to all of that, but he was very professional the way he handled it and he played very well for us in the regular season when he was healthy,"" Kerr said. He appeared in 53 games with seven starts averaging 14 minutes during his one season with the Warriors. Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff credited Golden State for the thoughtful gesture. ""Hats off to this organization and the class that they walk with,"" he said.","401070828"
"LOS ANGELES --  Tobias Harris scored 22 points, Lou Williams added 20 and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated Minnesota 120-109 Monday night, dropping the Timberwolves to 0-6 on the road this season. Led by Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose, the Wolves rallied in the fourth quarter when the duo combined to score 22 of the team's 25 points. Rose finished with 21 points and Butler had 16 of his 20 in the final period. Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Wolves. After resting Sunday in Portland, Butler scored Minnesota's first nine points of the fourth, twice getting the Timberwolves within one. The Clippers answered both times, with Williams hitting a basket and Montrezl Harrell scoring consecutive buckets for a 98-93 lead. Danilo Gallinari added 22 points for the Clippers, making all six of his free throws. Williams hit all five of his foul shots. Things got chippy twice in the fourth. Milos Teodosic was closely guarding Rose as he brought the ball up court and got called for a foul. Harrell ran up and started jawing at Rose. A few minutes later, Taj Gibson tripped over a sprawled Patrick Beverley on a rebound and Harrell knocked down Rose on a drive and got called for a foul on the other end. Security briefly came on the floor, and the play away from the ball was reviewed. Gibson received a technical foul. The Clippers built an 11-point lead early in the third when Beverley came off the bench to hit a 3-pointer and make another basket. Helped by four straight points from Rose and a 3 by Andrew Wiggins, the Wolves trailed 92-84 heading into the fourth. The teams played a tight first half, when they both shot 51 percent from the floor and neither led by more than six points. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Fell to 0-3 on their West Coast trip with two games remaining. ... All five starters finished in double figures. ... Rose started after sitting out Sunday with a sore left ankle. Clippers: Snapped a six-game skid against the Timberwolves, ending their longest active losing streak against one opponent.","401070829"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  A fourth-quarter surge helped Charlotte complete a successful homestand. Still, coach James Borrego and All-Star guard Kemba Walker know the Hornets need to play better if they want to improve on their 6-5 start. Walker had 29 points and seven assists as Charlotte beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-102 on Tuesday night. Marvin Williams added 20 points for the Hornets, who finished a 3-1 homestand. ""I give Atlanta a lot of credit,"" Borrego said. ""They really guarded us tonight. They're very active with their shifts. We were real stagnant and we didn't have a great rhythm offensively until the fourth quarter."" That's when Walker and Williams spurred a 19-4 spurt that allowed the Hornets to pull away from the Hawks (3-7). ""A win is a win,"" Walker said. ""We were a little sloppy early on. But we adjusted and made plays down the stretch and came out with a win."" Walker was critical of his five turnovers on a night when Charlotte committed 21 overall. ""They're pretty good defensively,"" Walker said. ""They're active and they disrupted us early. We have to do a better job of adjusting, especially me."" Walker and Williams scored 12 points apiece in the second half as Charlotte erased a 54-51 halftime deficit. Walker has scored 25 or more seven times in 11 games. Jeremy Lamb and Malik Monk each had 13 points for the Hornets. Nic Batum scored 10. Playing against his former team, Jeremy Lin had 19 points off the bench to pace the Hawks, who led by seven late in the first half. Atlanta started 2018 first-round draft picks Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and Omari Spellman for the first time and pushed Charlotte before losing for the eighth time in the last nine meetings. Young finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Kent Bazemore added 16 points. Even after falling behind 81-77 entering the fourth quarter, the Hawks forged an 84-83 advantage with 10:04 to play before the Hornets took over down the stretch. Charlotte eventually led by as many as 15. ""Coming out of halftime, we just couldn't buy a basket,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We had a couple of opportunities where I thought we could have got a bigger lead and extended. We had that opportunity. We just never created any separation. I thought that was the difference in the game."" Neither team led by more than seven until the fourth quarter. Even though he scored 18 points, Young was disappointed with his shooting. ""I can't go 0 for 7 from the 3-point line and expect to call that playing well,"" said Young, the No. 5 pick in the draft out of Oklahoma. ""My teammates did a great job of playing hard and making plays. But we just couldn't hit enough shots in the second half."" TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce considers Walker one of the NBA's top players. ""I'm a huge fan of Kemba. I've known Kemba for a long time. You're seeing a confident and elite scorer,"" Pierce said. He first met Walker at Nike Elite camps years ago, and in August 2017 was a part of the NBA Africa trip with the Hornets' two-time All-Star guard. Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist dislocated his right pinkie in the first half but returned to play in the second. ... Borrego thinks the 20-year-old Young can thrive as a pro. ""He fits today's NBA for sure. The minute he crosses halfcourt, he's a threat. He's a guy that can play-make, get to the rim, pass, finish, shoot the ball. The Hawks have a very good point guard for years to come,"" Borrego said.","401070830"
"DALLAS --  The Mavericks have had the Washington Wizards' number in recent years, and Dallas' young backcourt ensured that remained the case Tuesday night. Luka Doncic scored 23 points and Dennis Smith Jr. made three key plays down the stretch as the Mavericks ended a six-game losing streak by beating Washington 119-100. It was the Mavericks' 16th win in their last 17 meetings with the Wizards. In the first half, when Dallas built a 24-point lead, it looked like a foregone conclusion. The Wizards climbed back within six midway through the fourth quarter, but Smith scooted past Dwight Howard to grab an offensive rebound and fed a cutting DeAndre Jordan for a dunk that put the Mavs up 101-93 with 5:33 left. Just 30 seconds later, the pair collaborated again on a pretty alley-oop, then Smith stole the ball from Bradley Beal near half-court and got it to Harrison Barnes for a three-point play and a 13-point lead. ""This is where you've got to trust your players,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Dennis has earned the trust. He's seeing things, and those plays were real pivotal plays in the game and it kept them at a distance."" Smith finished with 19 points and seven assists. Wesley Matthews added 22 points for Dallas, and Barnes had 19 points and 13 rebounds. John Wall led the Wizards with 24 points. Otto Porter Jr. and Beal had 19 each, but Beal was 1 for 9 on 3-point attempts. Washington was just 11 for 35 on 3s. ""We just didn't make shots and we didn't communicate well in transition,"" Wall said. ""In the third quarter, we did a better job of playing with intensity. I just feel like maybe eight, 10 wide-open 3s, we just missed and still had a chance down six in the fourth quarter with five minutes to go."" Doncic scored 13 in the first half, including a rainbow 3 just before the halftime buzzer to put Dallas up 70-49. It was the Mavs' highest first-half output of the young season. Washington started the third quarter strong, with Beal scoring seven points in a 12-4 run to pull within 13. Porter had three 3s in the quarter, the last in the final seconds to bring the Wizards within single digits for the first time since the first period. THREE FEELS GOOD While Dallas is just 3-7, the Mavericks won their third game considerably sooner than the previous two seasons -- they started 2-14 last year and 2-13 in 2016-17. BACK IN FORM Barnes delivered his first double-double of the season in a strong performance after missing the first four games of the year due to a right hamstring strain. Barnes credits having played with great players at Golden State before coming to Dallas and now having a role model in teammate Dirk Nowitzki. ""The biggest thing I've learned from them is to do it by example every single day,"" Barnes said. ""To come in, to put the work in, and let that speak for itself."" TIP-INS Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks reminisced about Dallas counterpart Rick Carlisle, his roommate in the CBA in 1987. ""He doesn't get a lot of credit for being a great player,"" Brooks said. When pressed by skeptical reporters about his claim, Brooks drew laughter by arguing that he would recognize greatness because: ""I WAS a great player. I was better than a lot of guys that you're asking me about and a lot of guys that tried to make it,"" he said. Mavericks: Devin Harris missed his ninth straight game with a left hamstring strain. Carlisle said Harris wouldn't play before the weekend at the earliest. ... Jordan had 12 rebounds and has been in double digits in all 10 games with the Mavs. ... Dallas made 26 of 27 free throws, with nine players making at least one.","401070831"
"PHOENIX --  Phoenix was the perfect place for the improving Brooklyn Nets to start a four-game trip, with the two top teams in the West still to come in Denver and Golden State. The Nets beat the struggling Suns 104-82 Tuesday night and are 6-1 in Arizona since moving from New Jersey to Brooklyn in 2012. Caris LeVert scored 26 points, D'Angelo Russell added 15 and the Nets won their third game in the past four, while the Suns have lost eight of nine. Devin Booker led Phoenix with 20 points but made just 6 of 21 shots. Deandre Ayton had 15 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. ""We just tried to make every shot tough, every catch tough,"" LeVert said. ""We did a good job of that."" Brooklyn held the Suns to a season low in points and field goal shooting at 34.6 percent. ""We're growing up in terms of our physicality on the defensive end,"" Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson said. The Suns went on a 9-0 run to turn a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to 63-58 difference on Trevor Ariza's corner 3 with 5:31 to play. The Nets regained a 14-point lead, 74-60, with Spencer Dinwiddie's 3 at the 2:18 mark. ""Not to look forward, but you look at the schedule and you know who you have next and this one is definitely a winnable game,"" Nets center Ed Davis said. ""It's a game we definitely needed to win and handled business."" Phoenix never threatened in the fourth, the Suns' cold shooting helping the Nets remain in control. Davis' dunk made it 92-74 with 4:15 to play. The Nets' strategy seemed to be to let the 7-foot-1 Ayton shoot mid-range shots rather than allow him to work inside the paint. It worked for much of the game, as the Suns' high-profile rookie made just 6 of 17 shots. Both teams struggled to hit shots in the first quarter, with field goal percentages of less than 40 both ways. The Nets, up two after one quarter, led by 14 during the second quarter. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson's short turnaround bank shot made it 47-34 with 2:53 to go before halftime. ""Energy, effort wasn't there, mind wasn't there,"" Suns head coach Igor Kokoskov said. Phoenix got back-to-back 3s from Mikal Bridges and Ariza to cut the lead to 50-42, and the Suns trailed by 10 at the half. Suns backup center Richaun Holmes had season highs of 13 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Nets: The Nets outscored the Suns 54-30 in points in the paint. ... G Jared Dudley returned to Phoenix for the first time since being traded in the offseason. He spent seven seasons over two stints with the Suns. ... F DeMarre Carroll has yet to play this season due to a right ankle injury. Suns: F T.J. Warren returned after missing the team's last game with back spasms. ... Booker entered the game second in the NBA with an average of 9.8 points per game in the fourth quarter. He had four in the final 12 minutes. ... G Jamal Crawford moved into 29th place career in games played (1,271). UNEXPECTED LETDOWN The Suns, coming off a 102-100 win over Memphis on Sunday, had hoped that win was the start of a turnaround. But it didn't happen, at least right away, and the home team heard the boos toward the end of the game. ""It sucks, man,"" Booker said. ""We thought last game would be our step forward and we definitely took a step back tonight. We got blown out in front of our fans, so it's embarrassing."" Kokoskov wasn't pleased with the performance. ""I know the fans love the Phoenix Suns, come here excited to watch these guys. They're not driving home happy,"" he said. DUDLEY DOING RIGHT Dudley, with 11 pro seasons to his credit, has started all 11 games for the Nets this season, and Atkinson said Dudley gets an ""A-plus"" for leadership. ""He's doing it in the locker room and he is also doing it with his play because he doesn't need the ball in his hands,"" Atkinson said. ""He's going to space the floor and he's an intelligent defender.""","401070832"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  In search of his jump shot, CJ McCollum watched every single 3-pointer he took last season looking for what he lost. Fortunately for the Portland Trail Blazers, he found it. McCollum scored 40 points and Portland beat Milwaukee 118-103 on Tuesday night to hand the Bucks their second loss in 10 games this season. ""Whether I play well or not, I know how much time I spend preparing,"" McCollum said. ""The only thing I saw was I had a lot of in-and-outs and I was shooting with a dead wrist. That was the only thing I noticed. I wasn't locking my wrist out, so I just tried to lock my wrist out."" The result was a dazzling performance against one of the NBA's best teams early this season. ""A lot of credit to CJ. He had a heck of a night,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Any time we made a bit of a run or felt like the momentum might be changing, McCollum hit a big shot."" McCollum, who entered shooting well below his career averages, went 17 for 26 from the field and added six assists. ""It was tough,"" Milwaukee big man Brook Lopez said. ""He made some huge plays and some tough shots that definitely were contested."" Evan Turner had 16 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for the Blazers (8-3). Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 23 points and nine rebounds. Lopez shot 6 for 10 from 3-point range and finished with 22 points. In the third quarter, McCollum put on a show. He scored 19 points and made Bucks rookie guard Donte DiVincenzo fall down on a crossover move before hitting a basket, sending the crowd into a frenzy. ""Welcome to the league,"" Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic said. ""It can be hard some nights. Put some ice and you'll be fine."" Portland led by 14 after three. Play began at a fast pace that carried on throughout in a meeting between two of the top five offenses in the NBA. With only 16 foul shots combined, the game took less than two hours. Portland outscored the Bucks 33-31 in the first quarter as both teams shot better than 50 percent from the floor and the 3-point line. TIP-INS Bucks: Now with Budenholzer in charge, Milwaukee is playing a much different style this season. After being a bottom-five team in 3-point attempts last season, the Bucks came in second in the NBA in 3-point tries with 41 per game. That included their 117-113 loss at Boston in which they put up 55 shots from beyond the arc. ""Yeah, it's a lot,"" Budenholzer said. ""The game is always evolving with teams, coaches and players trying to figure out what gives them the best chance. The skill of players now today is special, so trying to push that envelope."" Trail Blazers: One of the biggest changes for the Trail Blazers this season has been utilizing Turner as the primary ball-handler on their second unit. The results have led to one of the best bench units in the NBA so far, ranking ninth in scoring. ""The second unit comes in, their ball movement, their execution -- they're playing with each other,"" Budenholzer said. ""They take advantage if the defense overcommits or over-rotates. They're playing really well together. Evan Turner is kind of a great setup guy with that group. It's interesting to see how they've changed a little bit and how it's working for them.""","401070833"
"CLEVELAND --  Oklahoma City's big fourth-quarter lead was gone and Russell Westbrook was unavailable. The Thunder didn't panic and regrouped in the closing minutes to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 95-86 on Wednesday night. ""Thank God we were able to make a few more shots and get some late stops,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""I give our guys credit. We persevered and stayed with it. To get a win on the road is a good thing."" Dennis Schroder scored a season-high 28 points in replacing the injured Westbrook, who sprained his left ankle Monday. Oklahoma City won its sixth straight game without the two-time MVP after starting the season 0-4. Schroder, starting in Westbrook's place, was 11 for 19 from the field. Paul George scored 18 points and Jermai Grant had 12. ""We understand the NBA,"" George said. ""Runs are a part of the game. Every game is not going to be perfect."" Cleveland (1-10) rallied from an 11-point deficit early in the fourth  to go ahead. Oklahoma City led 78-67 before the Cavaliers went on a 13-0 run. J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver each hit two 3-pointers and the Cavaliers led 80-78 with 7:02 remaining. Alex Abrines' 3-point shot from the corner with 4:31 left broke an 84-84 tie and put Oklahoma City on top for good. Cleveland added two more players to its ever-growing injury list. Rookie point guard Collin Sexton made his first career start after George Hill was a late scratch because of a sore right shoulder. Sexton, taken with the eighth pick in the draft, scored a team-high 15 points in a career-high 42 minutes. He was told about 30 minutes before tipoff that he would be starting. ""I was ready, no surprise,"" he said. ""I didn't have any butterflies. You always have to be prepared that your chance is going to come."" Cedi Osman started in forward Kevin Love's spot, but left with back spasms in the first quarter and didn't return. Love had surgery on his left foot and is expected to be out for several weeks. Smith scored 13 points and Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson each had 11 for Cleveland. Oklahoma City scored 17 straight points over a period of 4:36 in the second and third quarters to take a 56-40 lead. The Thunder scored the last nine points of a lackluster first half to take a 48-40 lead. George made a basket and a free throw before ending the second quarter with a 29-foot 3-pointer as the buzzer. Schroder had a three-point play and a jumper and Grant hit a 3-pointer to help build the 16-point lead. Westbrook traveled with the team, but no timetable has been given for his return and he's unlikely to play Thursday against Houston. He's averaging 24.1 points, 8.9 assists and 8.3 rebounds in seven games. NICE FILL-IN Schroder didn't have an assist, but committed only two turnovers in 34 minutes. ""They overplayed me, so I tried to put pressure on the rim and score big-time,"" he said. ""They played smart and they switched every time, so me and Paul had to be aggressive at the rim."" INJURY UPDATES Cavaliers coach Larry Drew didn't learn of Osman's injury until the second-year player left the game. Hill hurt his shoulder late in Monday's loss in Orlando and couldn't get loose enough to play. ""They took Cedi in the back and came back and said he was done for the night,"" Drew said. ""I don't know the extent of the injury, we'll have to wait and see how he is. George was hurting this morning. He tried to participate in shoot-around. He didn't look good, he didn't look good at all. We elected to just sit him out tonight."" Hill had his best game of the season Monday with 22 points. TIP-INS Thunder: Donovan was hit with a technical as the first quarter ended. George complained about not getting a foul called when he drove to the basket earlier in the period and gave the officials a disgusted wave. ... The winning streak is the second-longest active streak in the NBA, trailing only Golden State (eight). Cavaliers: Drew juggled his starting lineup after power forward Sam Dekker sprained his left ankle Monday. Osman moved to Dekker's spot and Smith started at small forward, but that alignment didn't last long. Osman played only six minutes because of the injury. Center Ante Zizic had 10 points and nine rebounds in 17 minutes.","401070834"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Detroit center Andre Drummond has expanded his offensive game dramatically. Drummond had 23 points and 19 rebounds and the Pistons beat the Orlando Magic 103-96 on Wednesday night to snap a five-game losing streak. Drummond hit 10 of 16 shots, including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter, and nailed both free throw attempts. He scored 19 points in the first half, then set picks and chased down offensive rebounds for teammates in the final two periods. ""Andre was the player of the game for me,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""The way he competed, just playing hard. Not one play was called for him, but he's not worried about touches. He just goes out and plays his butt off and once we all get in our mind what the important things are to win in this league, we're going to be OK."" The Pistons were especially good at the end of each quarter and needed it to squeeze out a win. Detroit rallied from a 15-point first quarter and 11-point third quarter deficits to keep within tracking distance of the Magic. After allowing Orlando to pull to 94-93 with 2:58 left in the game, Detroit ran off nine straight points to seal their first win on this six-game trip. ""We've been struggling with finishing quarters, letting teams go on runs and it's been killing us,"" said reserve Langston Galloway, who had 12 points and six rebounds. ""For us to finish out those quarters was big."" Evan Fournier led Orlando with 27 points, D.J. Augustin had 16, Aaron Gordon 15 and Nikola Vucevic 14, but the Magic's bench was dismal. Terrence Ross had 15 points, but the rest of the reserves combined to shoot 1-for-14 with 11 turnovers between them. ""The starters were really good and the bench was ... whoa!"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""They were bad, I mean really, really bad, not competitive in either half. That makes it hard to win in this league. Guys have to be professional and be ready to play. The bench was embarrassing, that's it."" Fournier hit three straight shots and Aaron Gordon added a dunk to pull Orlando to 94-93 with 2:58 left. Griffin made a pair of free throws to start a 9-0 run for Detroit that Jackson finished with a 3-pointer and a layup. The Magic opened the third period with three straight 3-pointers and a 27-9 run to take a 78-67 lead, Detroit, as it did the first two periods, rallied in the final minute to get control. Griffin hit a 3-pointer and a layup and Ish Smith had a block and breakaway layup at the buzzer that made it 80-78, TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond has 19 or more rebounds in three of the last four games. ... Detroit has attempted a team-record 328 3-pointers in its first 10 games. ... The backups had a plus-82 rating in the game. Magic: The Magic started the fourth quarter 0 for 7 from the field and committed seven turnovers. ... Orlando got two four-point plays in the first half, one from Ross and another from Augustin. ... The Magic bench had a minus-110 rating. ISAAC CONCERNS Orlando hasn't seen much of a return on Jonathan Isaac, the sixth pick in the 2017 draft. Isaac missed 55 games his rookie year with ankle problems. He started the first eight Magic games this season, but missed the last three with another sprained ankle. He took some shots during practice Wednesday, is not expected to play for at least another week. ""It's important we handle this the right way so it's not one of those things where he plays two games and it's sore and he has to miss one,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Hopefully he'll feel 100 percent and then just play injury free or pain free the rest of the season.""","401070835"
"ATLANTA --  Tim Hardaway Jr. knows the New York Knicks are depending on him to take charge when necessary. Sometimes that's easier said than done. ""I can just remember from the Indiana game (last week) how many opportunities I had to take over and put my name on the game, and I didn't take advantage of that,"" he said. ""I just wanted to make sure that we did a good job of executing down the stretch and try to put the game in my hands and on my shoulders."" Hardaway scored 27 of his 34 points in the second half, reserve Enes Kanter added 17 points and 11 rebounds, and the Knicks beat the Atlanta Hawks 112-107 on Wednesday night. In a matchup of rebuilding clubs, Allonzo Trier finished with 16 points and Noah Vonleh had 11 points and 13 rebounds to help New York snap a two-game skid. Omari Spellman scored 18 points for the Hawks, who have lost two straight and six of seven. Alex Poythress' basket cut the lead to four with 22.8 seconds remaining, but the Hawks blew their next two possessions when Poythress dropped an inbound pass and Taurean Prince missed two free throws. Trae Young finished with 15 points and eight assists for Atlanta, but the NBA's fifth-overall draft pick missed 13 of 19 shots and went just 1 for 7 on 3-point attempts. ""We get down double digits in that third quarter, really from an inability to score,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""There are a lot of reasons. Out of sync. Trying to find the rhythm of the group. Someone to kind of give us life."" Hardaway, who had career highs of 16 free throws made and 20 attempted, forced his will in the third as one of the few veteran players on the floor. He was 5 for 8 from the field and had 15 points, two steals and one blocked shot. ""I was trying to get my rhythm back in the first half,"" he said. ""Then in the second half we started getting defensive stops, steals, blocks, getting back on defense. That kind of propelled me on the offensive end and kept me going."" The Knicks never trailed after Emmanuel Mudiay's 3 made it 65-63 midway through the third. They took their biggest lead at 16 on Kanter's two free throws in the final minute of the period. Kanter got tangled up with Hawks reserve center Miles Plumlee on a rebound attempt early in the fourth. He flipped over and landed on his head after both players fell to the floor. Kanter stayed in the game and shook off any bad vibes. ""We are having fun, especially all of the young guys,"" Kanter said. ""The chemistry is getting there, so we are just going to go there, smile, have fun and try to get a win."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kevin Knox, the No. 9 overall draft pick, was 0 for 6 from the field and did not score in nine minutes. It was his second game back after missing seven with a sprained left ankle. He had two points in five minutes of Monday's double-overtime loss to Chicago. ... Ntilikina, the eighth overall pick, is the only Knick to start the first 12 games. Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce said rookie F Kevin Huerter, the 19th overall pick, was not with the team because of a family matter. ... Young, Huerter and Spellman started at Charlotte, marking the first time since April 1, 2005 that the Hawks started three rookies. Josh Smith, Josh Childress and Royal Ivey were in the lineup that day against Boston. ON THE MEND An MRI last week showed the mild inflammation in his left ankle looks better, but Hawks F John Collins likely won't return to practice until next week. He has missed the first 11 games.","401070836"
"MIAMI --  Hassan Whiteside wants a recount. Even if that doesn't happen, he finally knows what it's like to beat San Antonio. Whiteside had 29 points, 20 rebounds and an NBA season-high nine blocked shots -- he thinks it was 10, and some of his teammates and coaches feel the same way. That was all the Miami Heat had to fret about Wednesday night, after they snapped a four-year drought against San Antonio by beating the Spurs 95-88. ""It would have been pretty cool for him to get that triple-double,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But the context of his winning plays had nothing to do with the stat line. When he brings that kind of intensity, competitiveness, the defensive efforts ... we're clearly a different team."" Spoelstra's postgame news conference was interrupted by a crasher -- Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who burst through a side door. ""That's baloney. Everything he just said is pure crap,"" Popovich said, before jumping onto the platform where Spoelstra was speaking and giving the Heat coach a hug. The coaches laughed, and Popovich then said ""go to hell"" before walking out. So everyone left happy. Whiteside just left happier than most, even without his triple-double. ""Whoever's got to review it, review it,"" Whiteside said. Many numbers were without dispute: The Spurs shot 33 percent, their lowest in a regular-season game since 2008, and connected on only 29 percent of their 2-point tries. ""We all have nights like these,"" said San Antonio's LaMarcus Aldridge, who had six points on 2-for-14 shooting. ""Hopefully they're few and far between."" Wayne Ellington scored 20 points and Justise Winslow added 16 for the Heat, who had dropped their last nine regular-season games to the Spurs -- and 11 consecutive games overall going back to the 2014 NBA Finals. ""We've got a lot of guys who are capable,"" Ellington said. ""Tonight was my night to get out there and be able to contribute."" Josh Richardson added 14 for the Heat, who were down to an eight-man rotation for the second half because of injuries and Dwyane Wade missing the game for personal reasons. Patty Mills scored 20 off the bench for San Antonio. Davis Bertans scored 19 and DeMar DeRozan added 18 for the Spurs, who had a 50-12 edge in bench scoring. The Spurs were down 19 in the fourth before rallying. Bryn Forbes had a chance to get San Antonio within two with about 30 seconds left, but his 3-pointer missed, Whiteside grabbed his 20th rebound and the Heat escaped. Whiteside had played against the Spurs five times previously, and the Heat lost all of them. He's now been part of at least one win against 29 NBA clubs -- with Miami the lone exception. ""I hope I never beat them,"" Whiteside said. TIP-INS Spurs: Derrick White (heel) made his season debut, started and was scoreless in 16 minutes. ... Down 15-4, the Spurs subbed all five starters out simultaneously just 4:22 into the game. ... San Antonio's 42 first-half points were a season-low. Heat: Richardson missed his first eight shots and finished 6 for 22. ... Ellington started and played 37 minutes after logging only 12 minutes in two appearances so far this season. He missed the start of the season with ankle soreness. EARLY RUN The Spurs led only twice, at 2-0 and 4-2. Miami had a 15-0 run in the opening minutes to take the lead, the biggest stretch of consecutive points against San Antonio so far this season. MANY MISSING Besides Wade, Miami was also without point guard Goran Dragic (right knee inflammation), Dion Waiters and James Johnson (recovering from surgeries), and Derrick Jones Jr. was ruled out at halftime with a bruised right knee. The Spurs were without Rudy Gay (right heel soreness), Pau Gasol (right foot soreness) and former Miami Hurricane standout Lonnie Walker IV (recovering from knee surgery). EIGHT WAS ENOUGH Whiteside had eight blocked shots in the first half. That was a Heat record for any half; the previous first-half mark was seven by Alonzo Mourning in 1999, and the second-half mark is seven by Whiteside -- twice, most recently in 2016.","401070837"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Philadelphia 76ers finally found a solution to their road woes Wednesday night. Start fast and finish strong. Joel Embiid scored 20 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and Ben Simmons flirted with a triple double, leading the 76ers past Indiana 100-94 for their first non-home court victory this season. ""I'm excited that we got our first road win this year,"" coach Brent Brown said. ""We were pleased to get a win, especially after a performance we wanted to forget (at Brooklyn)."" The splits coming into the game were astonishing. Despite going 6-0 at home, the 76ers were 0-5 on the road, losing by an average of 15.2 points. And they had lost eight straight at Indiana, dating to a victory on April 17, 2013. So just three nights after an inexplicable 25-point loss at Brooklyn, Embiid, Simmons and their teammates felt right at home in one of coach Brent Brown's favorite NBA arenas. Embiid collected his league-high 11th double-double on what he called an off night. Simmons had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists and Dario Saric scored a season-high 18 points by going 4 for 6 on 3-pointers. And they did it by simply sticking to the plan. They quickly jumped to a 19-9 lead, weathered Indiana's rally, then regained control by closing the third quarter on a 6-1 flurry and opened the fourth with a decisive 16-7 run. When it ended on Simmons' breakaway layup with 6:04 to play, Philadelphia led 94-77. ""We were just overthinking things,"" Simmons said. ""We were putting too much pressure on ourselves. We finally put it together."" The victory spoiled Victor Oladipo's best night of the season. He scored 24 points in the first half on 10 of 16 shooting and finished with a season-high 36 points. He also had seven assists, six rebounds and three blocks. But Oladipo and Domnatas Sabonis, who had 16 points and 11 rebounds, needed more help from their supporting cast to avoid losing their second straight home game. And when they didn't get it, the 76ers took advantage. ""We just didn't hit shots tonight, honestly,"" Oladipo said. ""I think we just need to loosen up a little bit and go back to playing free basketball."" TIP-INS 76ers: Had lost their last two to the Pacers. ... Robert Covington had 13 points, Landry Shamet had 12 and J.J. Redick scored 10. ... Redick has scored in double figures in 21 consecutive games since March 26. ... Philadelphia made 18 of 22 free throws but had only four offensive rebounds. ... Saric also had seven rebounds while Embiid had three blocks. Pacers: Have lost consecutive home games for the first time this season. ... Indiana is 5-2 against the Eastern Conference and 3-1 against Atlantic Division opponents. ... Oladipo extended his career-best streak of consecutive 20-point games to 11. ... Sabonis has scored 1,002 points since joining the Pacers last season. ... Indiana was 12 of 17 from the free-throw line and 8 of 31 on 3-pointers. ... the only other player in double figures was Bojan Bogdanovic with 13. THEY SAID IT 76ers: ""I was bad today,"" Embiid said, noting he had five turnovers. ""I thought the whole game was bad. I wasn't myself but my teammates picked it up for me. That was a good sight to see."" Pacers: ""We're playing good enough defense, keeping teams at or under 100,"" forward Thaddeus Young said. ""But in this league today, if you only score 98 or 94 points, it's going to be hard to win games. We're seeing it's very, very tough for us to win the game only scoring in the 90s.""","401070838"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  In a season when NBA teams are scoring more and playing faster on offense, the Memphis Grizzlies are taking the opposite approach -- relying on their defense. That certainly proved successful Wednesday night against the Denver Nuggets. Marc Gasol scored 20 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 4.6 seconds remaining, and Memphis edged the Nuggets 89-87 to end their five-game winning streak. The Nuggets (9-2) had a chance after Gasol's foul shots, but Nikola Jokic's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim and Denver's rebound tip was also off the mark. Memphis held the Nuggets to 39 percent shooting, including 8 of 32 from 3-point range. The 87 points were a season low for the Nuggets, and the 176 points combined by the teams tied for the fewest in an NBA game this season. ""We knew it was going to be an ugly game if we were going to have a chance of winning,"" Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said. ""We tried to get in the mud a little bit, be physical defensively and get the pace where we wanted it."" Jaren Jackson Jr. also had 20 points for Memphis, and Kyle Anderson finished with 14. Gasol grabbed 12 rebounds. Gary Harris led the Nuggets with 20 points, and Trey Lyles added 16 off the bench. Jamal Murray had 15 points and seven assists after scoring a career-best 48 in Monday night's win over Boston. Murray shot only 6 of 21 this time. ""I don't know what it was, but the ball didn't like me today,"" Murray said. Denver was up 83-82 before Memphis took the lead on a 3-pointer by Shelvin Mack with 1:45 left. Conley hit a floater with 40 seconds to go, but Lyles' dunk and a 22-foot jumper by Murray tied it at 87 before Gasol's winning free throws. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff told his team he wanted to get back to a defensive mentality and force opponents to fight through low-scoring games if they want to beat the Grizzlies. ""That's exactly what this win represents,"" Memphis guard Garrett Temple said. ""Holding this team -- as hot as they've been -- to 87 points at home ... it was a big win for us."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Murray was limited to seven points on 3-of-10 shooting in the first half. He missed his first four 3-pointers before converting one near the 9-minute mark of the third quarter. ... Jokic, who averages 11 shots a game, took just one -- his 3-point try in the closing seconds. ""I'll have to look at the tape to see what they are doing for him to only take one shot,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""Obviously, I would like him to take more shots, but right now he isn't shooting the ball and we will have to figure out why."" Grizzlies: Committed eight turnovers in the first quarter and finished with 18, compared to 19 for Denver. Memphis has had fewer turnovers than its opponent in every game this season. ... The Grizzlies (6-4) are 4-0 at home. . Gasol and Jackson had three blocks each. Jackson also made three steals. PACE OF PLAY The game was a contrast of styles, with Memphis relying on its slower-pace defensive approach against a Denver team that entered averaging almost 112 points per game. ""They definitely got us into their game,"" Nuggets reserve center Mason Plumlee said, later adding: ""It was a slow, slow game, so I think that benefited them."" Conley acknowledged Memphis can score 130 points in a game, but: ""Defensively, I do think this is what you should expect from us.""","401070839"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis made a 3-pointer, pulled up to hit a 10-foot jumper and threw down a two-handed reverse alley-oop jam in the span of about two minutes late in the first quarter. That pivotal stretch seemed to mark the end of Davis' recent shooting slump and the end of losing basketball for the New Orleans Pelicans. Davis had 32 points, 15 rebounds and four blocks in his best game since spraining his right elbow nearly two weeks ago, and New Orleans ended a six-game skid with a 107-98 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. ""I don't think it was entirely the elbow,"" Davis said. ""It was just me overthinking and hesitating on shots. Tonight I just played calm. The shots I felt comfortable shooting, I shot with no hesitation."" After missing four of his first five shots, Davis hit his next eight on his way to his first 30-plus point game since New Orleans beat the Los Angeles Clippers on Oct. 23. ""It was really big for him just to get his groove back,"" guard Jrue Holiday said. ""There were a couple games there like last game where he probably didn't shoot as well as he wanted to."" Holiday had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists while being guarded primarily by brother Justin. Julius Randle and Wesley Johnson each scored 12 points for New Orleans. ""We were just in a situation where we needed a win in the worst way,"" said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, whose team was back home after an 0-5 road trip. ""Just to come home and get a win, I think that takes a little bit of pressure off the guys."" Zach LaVine scored 22 and Jabari Parker had 20 points and 13 rebounds for Chicago, which has dropped five of six games. Justin Holiday and Wendell Carter Jr. each scored 17 points, and Carter also grabbed 11 rebounds. Davis' strong second quarter helped the Pelicans take 58-50 lead into halftime and New Orleans never trailed again, going up by as many as 18 late in the third quarter before Chicago rallied back to within single digits. ""We battled back tonight to make it a single-digit game there at the end,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""It all goes back to playing the right way from the beginning of the game. We've got a lot of work to do on both ends of the floor."" LaVine's 30-foot 3 cut New Orleans' lead to 94-88 with less than six minutes to go. But the Bulls never got closer. Jrue Holiday blocked a shot, hit a turnaround fade and added two free throws to help put the Pelicans up by nine with 1:30 left. ""He can do it on both ends, obviously,"" Davis said of Holiday. ""When he's playing like this, being the Jrue Holiday that we all know, we're definitely a tough team to beat and he's a tough player to guard."" TIP-INS Bulls: LaVine has scored 20-plus points in all 12 of his game this season. ... Ryan Arcidiacono scored 11 points, hitting three of four 3-point shots. ... The Bulls shot 39.6 percent (38 of 96) and missed 22 of 31 3s. Pelicans: Elfrid Payton missed his sixth straight game with a right ankle injury. Gentry said he's hopeful the starting point guard would be ready to return for New Orleans next game. ... Nikola Mirotic's recent long-range slump continued. He went 1-for-8 from 3, making him 10 of his last 43 from deep. He finished with nine points. ...... The Pelicans outrebounded the Bulls 55-46. ... Darius Miller hit three of four 3s and finished with 11 points. ... Holiday eclipsed 2,000 career assists with his fifth of the game. TURNOVER TROUBLE Although Chicago had won its previous game, both teams had largely struggled lately and the game got sloppy at times. New Orleans committed 15 turnover and Chicago 12. The Pelicans now have 103 turnovers in their previous six games. Against the Bulls, however, New Orleans had enough good ball movement to win, amassing 32 assists on 42 made field goals. PASSING OUT Davis had seven assists, giving him six or more in half of the eight games in which he has played. ""Knowing that a lot of teams are going to double-team me ... my job is to kick it out to the shooters and it's their job to make shots,"" Davis said. ""I've got to make the right plays, trust in my teammates and guys made shots tonight.""","401070840"
"Darrell Griffith, aka Dr. Dunkenstein, and former Jazz player, breaks down his favorite Donovan Mitchell dunk from Wednesday night. (0:23) SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell returned to Utah's lineup, and so did the Jazz's tenacious defense. The Jazz nearly led wire-to-wire in a 117-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night that snapped a four-game skid. They got there on the type of defensive play that propelled Utah into the playoffs a season ago. The Jazz clogged passing lanes and forced the Mavericks to make bad decisions. Dallas committed 25 turnovers, and Utah turned them into 31 points. ""We wanted to play our defense with some heart,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""I thought we did that. Now we got to add some smarts. That said, I thought we came out with the right frame of mind."" Mitchell scored 23 points in his first game back after missing a game with an ankle sprain. He also dished out seven assists and had five rebounds. Rudy Gobert had 17 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots. Alec Burks added 18 points off the bench. Utah earned its first home win of the season after opening with four straight home losses for the first time since 1974-75. The Jazz also snapped a four-game skid. Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 24 points. Harrison Barnes added 14 points, and DeAndre Jordan chipped in 11 points and 12 rebounds. Dallas lost for the seventh time in eight games. ""We had too many turnovers,"" Doncic said. ""That many turnovers, difficult to win a game."" Everything the Jazz need to be successful fell into place in the first half. Utah defended well, had strong ball movement and utilized smart shot selection. The end result is the Jazz pulled away from the Mavericks in quick and easy fashion. Utah seized control in the first quarter. The Jazz scored baskets on four straight possessions -- starting with a dunk from Derrick Favors and ending in a 3-point play from Gobert -- to take an 18-8 lead. Dallas closed within five points, making it 21-16 after J.J. Barea hit a pair of free throws. That's as close as the Mavericks would get. Seven turnovers undid any momentum Dallas could have created. The Jazz had a 13-0 advantage on points off turnovers by quarter's end. ""It's a big problem and we've got to get it solved,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""You give up 31 points on 25 turnovers on the road in the Western Conference, and you're going to have a rough night."" Utah strung together a 24-5 run over a seven-minute stretch spanning the first and second quarter. Mitchell rotated in with the second unit at the end of the first quarter and helped fuel much of the run. He assisted on three baskets in that stretch and scored another. Back-to-back baskets from Gobert and Burks punctuated the run and gave Utah a 45-21 lead with 7:18 left in the first half. HITTING FROM DEEP Dallas went 8 of 24 from the perimeter. It extended the team's franchise record to 193 consecutive games with at least five made 3-pointers. TIP INS Mavericks: Jordan collected at least 10 rebounds for a franchise record 11th straight game. ... Dallas outscored Utah 18-6 in second chance points. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Kawhi Leonard isn't making a big deal out of Toronto's NBA-best 11-1 start. He's trying to stay focused on the nuances of coach Nick Nurse's offense. Once that happens, Leonard says, the Raptors will really get rolling. Leonard had 25 points and 11 rebounds in his return from an ankle injury, and Toronto beat the Sacramento Kings 114-105 on Wednesday night. Pascal Siakam scored 21 points, Serge Ibaka had 14 points and 14 rebounds, and Kyle Lowry added 16 points and eight assists for the Raptors. ""This isn't our ceiling,"" Leonard said. ""With me not even knowing some of the offense, we have Kyle in the game most of the time. Once I start learning the offense, I can give him a little break and let him get some easier shots. I don't really know the offense in and out yet."" Toronto has won five straight since its lone loss this season at Milwaukee on Oct. 29. The Raptors pulled away against the Kings despite 23 turnovers. ""We were lucky to come out with this one,"" Danny Green said. ""You look up and down the line, the only thing we beat them in was rebounding. That's a good sign for us, to show how good this team can be."" Leonard sat out the previous two games and got off to a sluggish start early against the Kings before helping Toronto pull away. The two-time All-Star scored 10 points in the second quarter and 10 in the third, including a soaring, one-handed dunk through traffic. Leonard also made a pivotal 3-pointer in the fourth after Sacramento had pulled to 106-99. ""He was a little rusty at the start but he made some really big baskets late,"" Nurse said. ""They sent lots of bodies to him, which was good for us to see."" Toronto has won three straight against the Kings. Willie Cauley-Stein and Buddy Hield scored 24 points apiece for Sacramento. De'Aaron Fox added 20 points, and second overall draft pick Marvin Bagley III had 13. The Kings have lost two straight since winning five in a row. ""They don't make a lot of mistakes and they tortured us for the mistakes that we did make,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""They did a good job of bottling us up."" Toronto ended the first quarter on a 15-4 run, then took control once Leonard got going in the second after Sacramento got in foul trouble. Leonard made five free throws in the period, one coming after a frustrated Joerger was called for a technical foul for arguing with officials. Leonard also had a 3-pointer that put the Raptors up 49-40. Green added back-to-back 3s, and OG Anunoby followed with a steal and dunk as Toronto took a 64-51 halftime lead. BOARDING UP Toronto held a 51-35 rebounding edge, an area where the Raptors have not had much success this season. The 51 boards were a season-high for Nurse's team. ""I told them we did one rebounding drill today at shootaround and look what happened,"" Nurse said. ""So look for some more in practice coming up."" IT'S ALL ABOUT PACE The Kings are one of the fastest teams in the NBA this season and several Toronto players felt that Sacramento controlled the tempo of the game. Lowry disagreed. ""They were picking us up, tried to pressure us to try to speed us up but we didn't allow them to,"" Lowry said. ""We did a good job of staying locked in into what we were doing."" TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had his string of nine consecutive games with 10 or more assists snapped. ... Siakam scored 13 points in the first half on 5-of-7 shooting. ... Norman Powell was held out because of a left shoulder injury sustained Monday against Utah. Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic made his season debut after missing the first 10 games recovering from a pair of procedures on his left knee.

Nemanja Bjelica was called for a technical early in the third.","401070842"
"LOS ANGELES --  Tyson Chandler savored the ovations when he first took the court in downtown Los Angeles. The cheers at the end were even sweeter. The Lakers' newest big man got to represent his hometown Wednesday night for the first time in his 18 NBA seasons, and he came up bigger and better than even he expected in a hard-fought win. LeBron James had 24 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and Kyle Kuzma scored six of his 21 points in the final minutes of the Lakers' 114-110 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. James, Kuzma and Josh Hart played major roles in the Lakers' third win in four games, but they all directed praise toward Chandler, who joined the Lakers on Tuesday after reaching a buyout agreement with Phoenix. After LA's savvy basketball fans welcomed Chandler to town with cheers, the veteran provided much of what the Lakers have been lacking this season. ""It's honestly all love,"" Chandler said. ""I love this city the way they love me. When you're homegrown from here and going to high school and all that and you've had these same fans, and now you represent the jersey that everybody has been cheering for their entire lives, you kind of become one. I've been on the other side and played the villain. Now it's great to be on this side and actually rep them."" With only a cursory knowledge of the Lakers' plays and schemes, Chandler still provided defense, rebounding and hard picks while playing a surprising 23 minutes. Chandler's nine rebounds included two enormous offensive boards in the last minute. He then contested Derrick Rose's final 3-point attempt, forcing a miss that essentially sealed the win. ""You can tell he's a young-old guy that's happy to be back home, and he played with a lot of energy tonight,"" said Rajon Rondo, who was thanked by Chandler for vocally directing him around the court. Hart scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 20 for the Lakers, who avenged a loss at Minnesota nine days earlier with a tenacious finish at Staples Center. Kuzma's fourth 3-pointer put the Lakers up 111-104 with 1:51 to play, but Rose promptly hit back-to-back 3-pointers for the Wolves. After Chandler twice extended the Lakers' ensuing possession, Kuzma hit one of two free throws with 9.5 seconds left. Rose then missed his last 3 under heavy defensive pressure from Chandler, and Hart hit two free throws to seal it. Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau thought Rose deserved a foul. ""They're not going to give me that call,"" Rose said with a shrug. ""They haven't been giving me that call, so I've just got to get used to it."" Rose scored 31 points and Jimmy Butler added 24 for the Timberwolves, who dropped to 0-7 on the road this season with their fourth consecutive loss overall. Minnesota had won five straight over the Lakers. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Butler converted a four-point play to tie it at 94 with 7:44 to play. ... Thibodeau used the same starting lineup from Monday's loss to the Clippers. Lakers: James fell just shy of his 75th triple-double, but scored nine points in the fourth quarter. ... Chandler grew up in several parts of California before moving to Compton, where he starred at Dominguez High School and became the No. 2 pick in the 2001 NBA draft. ... Chandler backed up JaVale McGee, who had 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting. GOOD STARTS Minnesota came out in an offensive groove during its second straight game at Staples Center following Monday's loss to the Clippers. All five Wolves starters reached double figures in the first half while hitting 66 percent of their shots. Rose and Wiggins hit three 3-pointers apiece and all five starters contributed to an 11-for-17 performance beyond the arc, tying the franchise record for 3s in a first half. But the Lakers didn't get humiliated in the first quarter, as they did last Sunday in their loss to Toronto. Hart hit four 3-pointers in the first half, and Kuzma hit a buzzer-beating 3 to limit Minnesota's lead to 67-65. BAD BOARDS Minnesota was outrebounded 47-40, and it was most glaring in that final minute. ""Very, very frustrating to know we were that close, and all we have to do is rebound the basketball,"" Butler said. ""But that's been the story for us so far. We've been right there. We've been outrebounded. We have to figure out a way to go get the ball.""","401070843"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder have figured out how to win without Russell Westbrook -- they lock down on defense. Paul George scored 20 points, and the Thunder beat the Houston Rockets 98-80 on Thursday night for their seventh straight victory. Westbrook missed his second game in a row with a sprained left ankle, and the Thunder have won both. Oklahoma City held Cleveland to 37 percent shooting in a 95-86 victory Wednesday night, then limited Houston to 38 percent shooting on Thursday. George led the defensive charge with six steals. ""We didn't come in tonight thinking this was going to be an offensive battle, where we've got to outscore them on the offensive end,"" he said. ""We're just going to stick to playing defense. We've got guys that can guard and want to guard. That's just what it comes down to. (Defense) is what we're going to hang our hat on."" Oklahoma City got plenty of help from Houston -- the Rockets made just 11 of 42 3s. It was the fifth time in seven games that the Rockets failed to score at least 100 points. ""Maybe because all we do is talk about defense 24 hours,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Our offense is anemic. I mean, it's bad."" James Harden scored 19 points, but made just 7 of 19 shots. Clint Capela added 17 points for Houston, which had won three in a row despite its offensive struggles. Houston's Carmelo Anthony, who played for the Thunder last season and was traded this summer, scored two points on 1-for-11 shooting. Chris Paul added 10 points, five assists and six steals. Steven Adams had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Terrance Ferguson and Dennis Schroder each added 14 points for Oklahoma City. All five Thunder starters scored in double figures before the end of the third quarter. The Thunder led 59-45 at halftime behind 53.8 percent shooting. In the second quarter, George made all five of his shots and scored 14 points. Oklahoma City held Paul and Anthony scoreless before the break. Jerami Grant dunked on a lob from Schroder and made the free throw on the foul to put Oklahoma City up 80-60, a score that held up until the end of the third quarter. The Thunder coasted in the fourth. ""I don't know if we're just sagging because we don't believe in what we're -- I don't know,"" D'Antoni said. ""We've got to find the answers."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon missed his third straight game with a strained muscle in his right thigh. ... Anthony was mostly cheered when he checked into the game for the first time in the first quarter. ... Reserves made 1 of 11 shots in the first half. ...

QUOTABLE Adams, on defending Houston's outside shots: ""We knew they were going to put up a lot of threes. They're a 3-point-shooting team. The whole game plan was to try to get as many contests, and we did. It's not just contesting, mate. We did a good job at really getting out there and getting them in an uncomfortable position."" BENCH ROLE Houston's reserves shot a combined 6 for 27 from the field and made just 3 of 18 3-pointers. Oklahoma City's reserves shot 8 for 21.

"PHOENIX --  When their shots finally started to fall, the Boston Celtics couldn't be stopped. Kyrie Irving scored 18 of his season-high 39 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, and Boston rallied from a 22-point deficit for a 116-109 win over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. Irving scored Boston's first six points in the extra period, and Marcus Morris finished with 17 against his former team -- including the tying 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left in regulation off a feed from Irving. Morris hit from the top of the arc to tie it at 100. Jaylen Brown added 17 points, all after halftime, for the Celtics (7-4). ""Guys like Kyrie, he is going to have all the focus on him,"" Morris said. ""I worked on my 3-pointers extensively."" Devin Booker paced the Suns (2-9) with a season-high 38 points, and T.J. Warren had 29. The Celtics ended a two-game skid, while the Suns have lost nine of 10. Booker scored 12 points in the fourth quarter and seven in OT, but Phoenix couldn't hold onto a 16-point lead with 6:13 to play in regulation. The Suns led 92-76 when Booker dropped in a short fadeaway. ""We just fell apart down the stretch. Kept giving up quick buckets. Miscommunications on defense. A little bit of everything,"" Booker said. Boston recovered from an ice cold start and won despite shooting 40.2 percent from the field. The Celtics trailed by double digits for much of the second half until a furious late rally. Suns rookie Deandre Ayton had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Irving hit a 3 with 35.1 seconds to go in the fourth, then his steal led to Brown's layup that cut the Suns' lead to 98-97 with 7.3 seconds to play. Warren hit two free throws, then Morris took a pass from a double-teamed Irving for the tying 3. ""We just learned a lot about being resilient,"" Irving said. ""We had to make adjustments."" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov thought fatigue caught up to his team late in the game. He also wanted a foul against Irving on the Celtics' last possession of the fourth quarter. ""You take the blame and responsibility as a coach,"" Kokoskov said. Warren, starting for the first time since Oct. 31, scored 14 first-quarter points as the Suns took advantage of Boston's shooting woes. Phoenix led 32-13 after 12 minutes. After making their first shot of the game, a 3 by Irving, the Celtics missed their next 12 attempts and the Suns raced out to a 15-3 lead. Aron Baynes' putback with 5:04 left in the first quarter was the Celtics' second basket of the game, and they shot just 4 of 22 in the quarter. Boston got the lead down to 14 in the second, but a 3 from Booker gave the Suns a 48-26 advantage with 4:31 left in the half. The Celtics trailed 55-35 at the break. Consecutive baskets by Booker put the Suns in front 75-58 in the third quarter. ""I told Igor we didn't deserve to win the game, but it was a great individual performance by Kyrie, certainly,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. TIP-INS Celtics: The team's 13 points in the first quarter were a season low. ... Irving was the only starter to make a field goal in the first half. Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward and Brown were a combined 0 for 15. ... G Marcus Smart surpassed 1,000 rebounds and 400 steals for his career. Suns: Warren made his third start this season. Ryan Anderson came off the bench. ... Booker has 146 points in his last three games against the Celtics, including the career-high 70 he scored in Boston on March 24, 2017. ... A game after playing a season-low seven minutes, 2017 first-round draft pick Josh Jackson played only five. ANALYZING AYTON Stevens called Ayton a ""special talent"" when asked about the rookie before the game. ""He brings everything to the table you would think a really good player at that position brings,"" Stevens said. JAYLEN JAM Brown's first basket was a high-flying, one-handed dunk in transition at the 10:10 mark of the third quarter. Smart provided the assist.","401070845"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A gritty group of Trail Blazers backups was able to put away the Los Angeles Clippers. Damian Lillard had 25 points and Portland won its third straight game, 116-105 over the Clippers on Thursday night. It was a tight game until the fourth quarter, when the Blazers' reserves were able to get some separation. ""That was a grind-it-out kind of game. I thought our team did a good job just being present for the entire game. Our bench once again came through, with the spark down the stretch,"" Lillard said. ""End of the third, beginning of the fourth they had a really good stretch, opened it up a bit and left it there for us to close it out."" CJ McCollum added 23 points for Portland, which has won six of seven. The bench contributed 41 points and was critical when Lillard and McCollum rested at the beginning of the final period. Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams each scored 20 for the Clippers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a career-high 19. Portland had struggled all night to separate from the Clippers, but pulled in front 93-83 on Zach Collins' dunk with 9:42 left. Another dunk by Collins put the Blazers up 100-90 with 6:10 to go. The Clippers closed to 107-101 on Gallinari's jumper, but Jusuf Nurkic answered for Portland with a layup and Los Angeles could not get any closer down the stretch. ""I thought down the stretch -- the last eight minutes of the game -- our offense really let us down,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. There were questions before the game about the availability of Clippers forward Tobias Harris because of illness. Rivers said Harris was a game-time decision, but he was ultimately in the starting lineup. Harris, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, finished with 15 points and 11 boards for his fifth double-double this season. The Clippers were without Avery Bradley for the second straight game because of a left ankle sprain, and Luc Mbah a Moute missed his seventh game with a sore left knee. The Clippers missed Bradley's perimeter defense against Lillard and McCollum. Portland was without Maurice Harkless, who has missed seven straight games because of a sore left knee. Jake Layman has been starting in his place. The Blazers led 37-28 after the first quarter, paced by McCollum's 10 points. Portland never could extend the lead to double digits and led just 61-57 at the break. Gilgeous-Alexander and Montrezl Harrell each had 12 first-half points for the Clippers, while Lillard led all scorers with 14. Al-Farouq Aminu hit a 3-pointer that gave Portland a 78-68 lead, its largest to that point, midway through the third quarter. The Clippers narrowed it again, closing to 81-77 on Harris' driving floater. ""We didn't start the game with very good defense. In the first quarter we gave up 37 points,"" Gallinari said. ""Our defense got better but in the fourth quarter they were better than us, especially in the last five or six minutes when they were able to expand the lead."" Nurkic fouled out with 1:57 left, finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds. TIP-INS Clippers: The team put out a statement of sympathy for victims of the mass shooting in ThousandOaks, California, on Wednesday night. ThousandOaks is located northwest of Los Angeles. ... The Clippers were coming off a 120-109 win at home over Minnesota. Trail Blazers: The club held a moment of silence for victims of the shooting in California. ... Portland was coming off a 118-103 win at home over Milwaukee on Tuesday. ... The Blazers have won the last four meetings between the teams. ... Lillard did not shoot a free throw. CONTINUITY Before the game, Rivers said a key to the Blazers' success is their core group has been together for some time. Portland returned 11 players this season, including all five starters. ""I think our time together, how good we get along together, our understanding of what our coaches want us to do, our understanding of each other -- I think it's all coming together,"" Lillard said.","401070846"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry has counted on staying healthy after injuries limited him to 51 games last season. Everything was going according to plan for the Golden State star -- until Thursday night. The two-time MVP left with a leg injury and the Warriors were unable to recover in a 134-111 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks that snapped their eight-game winning streak. ""He seems good to me. I've got to talk to him tomorrow and see how he's doing,"" teammate Kevin Durant said. ""Hopefully he's doing well."" Eric Bledsoe scored seven straight points during Milwaukee's big third quarter and finished with 26. Giannis Antetokounmpo added 24 points, nine rebounds and four assists as the Bucks handed the Warriors their first defeat at home this season. The two-time defending NBA champions were already missing All-Star Draymond Green and then lost Curry midway through the third. Curry strained the adductor muscle in his left leg and went to the locker room shortly thereafter. He did not return. Curry grabbed at his inner thigh after trying to contest Bledsoe's shot in transition at the 6:50 mark of the third. He was receiving treatment postgame and is expected to have an MRI on Friday. Klay Thompson led the Warriors with 24 points and Durant had 17 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. Curry scored 10 points in his second straight game below 20 after getting at least 23 in every game previously -- including five 30-point performances and a 51-point outing in three quarters. He dished out six assists in 26 minutes. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said his players took the floor with ""mindless intent"" and then hurt themselves with foul trouble. ""Sometimes you've got to get hit in the mouth in this league to remind you how hard it is to win a game,"" he said. Malcolm Brogdon scored 20 points and Khris Middleton had 17 points and six assists as Milwaukee (9-2) won for the second straight time at Oracle Arena after a 116-107 victory on March 29. The Bucks outscored the Warriors 41-28 in the third and shot 65 percent inside the arc (43 of 66) overall. ""To come in here and play the defending champs and have a win like this, it's huge,"" Brogdon said. ""It's huge for our confidence. I think it sends a message around the league, but regardless we have to continue to play hard every night and play on both ends."" Antetokounmpo had 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block by halftime as the Bucks led 64-51 at the break. Bledsoe hit back-to-back layups to put the Bucks ahead 84-64 midway through the third then answered Curry's jumper with a 3-pointer the next time down. Donte DiVincenzo's basket at the 4:06 mark made it 93-69 and Kerr called a timeout. Jordan Bell had four points and five rebounds for the Warriors while moving into the starting lineup in place of Green, sidelined after spraining his right foot and toe in the first half of Monday's win over the Grizzlies. Golden State (10-2) is still tied for the second-best start in franchise history behind the 2015-16 team that began 24-0. The Warriors dropped to 6-1 at home. ""They just played hungrier than us,"" Thompson said. ""It was just an ugly night at the office."" TIP-INS Bucks: Held a 46-38 rebounding advantage. ... Milwaukee made it to the free throw line 19 times and made 15 of those in the first half to a 7-of-8 showing at the stripe by Golden State. ... The Bucks shot 5 of 20 from 3-point range in the first half. Warriors: Golden State shot 4 for 15 from deep in the first half and Thompson was the lone player to score in double figures. ... Bell made his 14th career start and first of the season. ... G Shaun Livingston missed his sixth straight game and eighth in the last 10 with a sore right foot. ... Andre Iguodala returned after sitting out Monday against Memphis as a rest day, checking into the game for the first time late in the opening quarter. ... Baron Davis of the 2007 ""We Believe"" Warriors received a roaring ovation when introduced and shown on the big screen 4:39 before halftime. MOMENT OF SILENCE A moment of silence was held for victims of the mass shooting in ThousandOaks. Kerr said he is ""devastated"" for the victims and families in a ""horrifying"" shooting he read up on Thursday. Of taking time before the game to remember the victims, Kerr is becoming accustomed to doing so. ""We had one last week and we're probably going to have one next week,"" he said. ""That's the reality until we do something about it. It's beyond sad.""","401070847"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Nikola Vucevic had 21 points and 14 rebounds and D.J. Augustin came up with big plays in the final two minutes to help the Orlando Magic beat the Washington Wizards 117-108 on Friday night. Augustin had six points, an assist and a steal after Washington cut a 25-point deficit to one at 106-105 with 2:30 remaining. Aaron Gordon added 20 points for Orlando, which shot 51 percent in beating Washington for only the fourth time in their last 21 meetings. Evan Fournier and rookie Mo Bamba had 15 points each, and Augustin finished with 11. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 27 points, and Wall had 19 points and 12 assists. Washington fell to 2-9.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid repeatedly stepped to the free throw line with one thought in mind during critical moments of the Philadelphia 76ers' overtime victory against the Charlotte Hornets. ""Got to make them,"" Embiid said. ""They call me `clutch' for a reason, so got to make them."" Embiid was 14 for 16 from the line between the fourth quarter and overtime to help ice the 76ers' 133-132 victory Friday night. He had 42 points and 18 rebounds. The Hornets fought back from a 21-point deficit and led by five with 1:18 remaining in regulation before the Sixers forced extra time. Kemba Walker scored 19 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter for the Hornets. Embiid challenged the Hornets' defense as they attempted a comeback victory and focused on drawing contact.  Hornets starting center Cody Zeller fouled out in regulation after committing five fouls in the fourth. ""It's tough keeping him off the free throw line just because he is so physical,"" Zeller said. ""He can shoot it from three, play off the dribble, he's obviously a wide body in the post, so those are the toughest guys to defend that can play kind of play at every spot on the court."" Embiid thrives on getting to the line where he is shooting 81.8 percent, up from 76.9 percent last season. He has earned the confidence of the Sixers to aggressively seek out shots there. ""He's a really good shooter anyways and he's confident by nature, so that's a pretty good collision of skill and mind,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""You trust him going to the line and shooting a high percentage. He's not afraid of the moment."" Embiid's execution down the stretch left the Hornets searching for answers on defense. ""I thought our bigs were great,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""They battled him. I thought they were fantastic defensively. They tried to beat him to spots. I don't know what to tell them when Embiid shoots 16 free throws in the fourth quarter and overtime, I don't know what to say to them."" To Embiid, the abundance of free throw attempts were all in a day's work. ""That's my job,"" he said. ""I've got to step up when there's an opportunity."" The Sixers improved to 7-0 at the Wells Fargo Center, the most home wins to start the season since 2002-03. MISSED OPPORTUNITY The Hornets committed a shot-clock violation with time winding down in regulation, missing an opportunity. ""I didn't lose track of time,"" Walker said. ""I just wanted to get the last shot. I wish I had got a better shot, but yeah, I just wanted to get something off. I wanted the last shot, that was really it.""

"ATLANTA --  The Detroit Pistons were so efficient on offense that they didn't need Blake Griffin to take many shots. The NBA's fifth-leading scorer loved sharing the ball on an easy night for his team. ""We just did a great job of taking exactly what the defense gave us,"" Griffin said. ""When we play like that and the ball is zipping and moving around, then it's a lot more fun."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 11 rebounds, Stanley Johnson added a season-high 22 points and the Detroit Pistons beat the Atlanta Hawks 124-109 on Friday night. In a game that was essentially decided in the first quarter, the Pistons were so dominant that they scored 74 points and led by 23 at halftime Griffin 0 for 2 from the field. ""He was very unselfish,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""He made the right plays."" Drummond's double-double was the 300th of his career, most in the league since his rookie season of 2012-13. The Hawks had nobody capable of matching up with his 6-foot-11, 279-pound frame. Drummond has hit 31 field goals, shot 62 percent and pulled down 54 rebounds in his last three games. The rebuilding Hawks, featuring one of the NBA's youngest rosters, have lost three straight and seven of eight. Jeremy Lin finished with 19 points. Trae Young added 16, and Omari Spellman had 14 points and 10 rebounds. ""It was right off the bat,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Slow start, sluggish. Our starting group, whether it's after halftime or to start the game, just lacking in the effort department. We have to figure it out. Rough night."" Griffin didn't take a shot until the 2:20 mark of the second, heading to halftime with seven assists and five rebounds in his first 10 minutes. His first basket, a 3-pointer from the left corner, came with 5:14 to go in the third, pushing the lead to 93-67. He finished with nine rebounds, nine assists and six points.

"MIAMI --  Winning on the road is supposed to be the tough part. Not so for these Indiana Pacers. Victor Oladipo had 22 points and 10 assists, Bojan Bogdanovic put Indiana ahead to stay on a 3-pointer with just under a minute remaining and the Pacers beat the Miami Heat 110-102 on Friday night for their fifth consecutive road victory. Indiana closed on a 16-2 run, the last 12 of those unanswered. ""They came to play,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""I told them, `Let's just ball,' and I thought they balled tonight."" Domantas Sabonis and Darren Collison each scored 17 for Indiana and Bogdanovic finished with 16 for the Pacers, who were coming off two home losses. Sabonis finished with 11 rebounds for the Pacers. Indiana held Miami to 37 percent shooting in the second half. ""Defense, no question about it,"" Oladipo said. ""Nothing else."" Kelly Olynyk led the Heat with 20 points, but missed most of the fourth quarter with an injury. Josh Richardson scored 18, Tyler Johnson had 15 and Hassan Whiteside ended up with 11 points and 20 rebounds for Miami. The Heat were again without Dwyane Wade, who's excused while he and wife Gabrielle Union-Wade continue celebrating the birth earlier this week of their daughter. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is calling Wade's absence day-to-day, though said the team will give him as much time as he wants and needs. ""I've seen us execute much better,"" Spoelstra said. ""But you do have to credit Indiana."" Olynyk left early in the fourth holding his midsection. Olynyk was kneed by Indiana's Tyreke Evans around the ribs, and remained down for a couple minutes before going to the locker room. It was part of a rough night for Olynyk -- he took an elbow in the face from Indiana's Thaddeus Young late in the first half. Young was ejected for the Flagrant-2 foul. Evans was called for an offensive foul on the play that knocked Olynyk from the game for most of the fourth; he returned in the final seconds. Miami led by 11 early and held a six-point lead with 3:50 left, then went cold -- shooting 1 for 8 with four turnovers the rest of the way. Bogdanovic's 3-pointer from the top of the key was the 12th and final lead change of the night, and capped the Pacers' rally from what had been as much as an 11-point deficit. ""That was Pacer basketball,"" McMillan said. ""I thought defensively we got after it, especially that second half."" Miami debuted its ""Vice"" court and uniforms, the black, fuchsia and light blue color scheme designed as nod to the city in the 1980s and the team's original home -- Miami Arena.

Rony Seikaly is the other, and he pulled the feat off four times. ... Miami was without Goran Dragic (right knee inflammation), who may try to play Saturday. ... Miami's first field-goal attempt came 3:37 into the game -- its first six possessions ended in either turnovers or trips to the foul line.

The Nets overcame a big bounce-back night from Denver's Nikola Jokic to win their third straight. In an offensive funk for the last four games, Jokic had a season-high 37 points and tied his career best with 21 rebounds. It wasn't enough to prevent Denver's first home loss of the season, thanks to LeVert's heroics. His defense helped hold Gary Harris to four points on 1-of-11 shooting, and then he beat his former Big Ten rival at the end. Jokic took only one shot Wednesday night in a loss to Memphis, a 3-pointer in the final seconds that would have given Denver the win. He took only 18 shots in the first four games of November but topped that before the end of the third quarter. He had 11 points in the first quarter and a double-double with 20 points and 12 rebounds at halftime. ""He was just aggressive,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He took advantage of some chances."" Jokic, normally jovial in postgame interviews, was subdued after Friday's loss. He said he didn't lack confidence in Memphis and said about Friday's game that he ""was feeling the ball tonight."" Denver appeared to take control after Jokic blocked Jarrett Allen, grabbed the rebound and fed Malik Beasley for a layup and a 108-106 lead with 1:23 left. After a Brooklyn miss, Paul Millsap's two free throws made it a four-point game. The Nets tied it with 29 seconds left and Jokic was called for traveling with 22 seconds left. LeVert got the ball up top and was blanketed by Harris. He broke through the tight defense to get into the lane and hit a soft lob to give Brooklyn the win. ""I just tried to get the last shot and get the kind of shot I wanted to get,"" LeVert said of Harris ""I thought he was going to scoot back at one point but he kind of pressed up the whole time. I saw him leaning so I just took it."" D'Angelo Russell led the Nets with 23 points, and Allen had 18. TIP-INS Nets: DeMarre Carroll scored nine points in 14 minutes in his season debut. He missed the first nine games following right ankle surgery. ... The Nuggets played a short tribute video for Kenneth Faried's return to Denver. Faried was traded to Brooklyn after seven years with the Nuggets. Nuggets: Denver attempted two free throws in the first half and 32 in the second half. ... Harris's four points were a season low. It is the first time in 12 games he hasn't scored in double figures. GOT YOUR BACK Malone defended Jokic for his comments last week that drew a $25,000 fine from the NBA. Jokic's was dinged for his use of a gay slur after a win in Chicago on Oct. 31. ""There's so many things being said about this poor kid, and I understand some of it,"" Malone said. ""Those of us who know him, give the kid a break. He made a mistake, he paid for it, get off his back a little bit. He's a great kid, he loves everybody and meant no offense to anybody. He's going to be fine and let the kid be a 23-year-old young kid who's going to have a great, great future in a Nuggets uniform."" BARTON UPDATE Denver swingman Will Barton talked Friday morning, the first time he spoke to the media since having surgery to fix core and hip muscle injuries. There is no timetable for his return. Barton said Friday he's ""getting stronger every day"" but doesn't know when he can get back. ""Whenever this thing lets me. I wish it was tomorrow,"" he said. ""I'm taking it day by day."" Barton was carted off the floor on Oct. 20 against Phoenix after he said he felt something pop when he took off for the basket. He had surgery days later.","401070852"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Gordon Hayward got a cold reception in Utah. He was booed every time he touched the ball, and his Boston Celtics left town with a loss. Joe Ingles matched his career high with 27 points and added a season-best seven assists to help the Jazz beat the Celtics 123-115 on Friday night in Hayward's return to Salt Lake City. Hayward had 13 points and seven assists in 25 minutes during his first game back in Utah since leaving the Jazz as a free agent to sign with the Celtics after the 2016-17 season. He broke his left ankle in Boston's opener last season. The star forward spent his first seven NBA seasons with the Jazz after they drafted him ninth overall in 2010. He averaged 15.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists for Utah, but took the hostile reaction from Jazz fans in stride. ""I kind of expected some of that,"" Hayward said. ""They were booing me from the get-go, so it's part of the game."" Boston trimmed a 20-point deficit to four by the fourth quarter. Playing without injured Kyrie Irving, the Celtics closed within four on multiple occasions late in the period, the final time on a 3-pointer from Marcus Smart that made it 111-107 with 2:19 left. Rudy Gobert quickly answered with a layup that pushed the lead back to six. Jayson Tatum followed by missing back-to-back layups that could have cut the deficit again, and Boston never got closer. Jae Crowder finally slammed the door on the comeback with a corner 3 that gave Utah a 117-109 lead with 47.7 seconds left. Utah coach Quin Snyder thought his team turned a corner by hanging tough down the stretch against the Celtics. ""Our team has not been able to handle successes during games at times,"" Snyder said. ""We've lost focus sometimes when we've hit shots. Teams are going to come back on you, but you can't make it easy on them."" Donovan Mitchell scored 21 points for Utah. Crowder had 20, and Gobert finished with 17 points and 15 rebounds. The Jazz won their second straight home game and second in a row overall. ""We all have picked it up, picked up our energy defensively, picked our focus up,"" Mitchell said. ""We've been having great practices, but we just didn't put it into the games. I think over the past couple of games, we've done that."" Terry Rozier scored a season-high 22 points, making his first start in place of Irving, and Jayson Tatum added 21 for the Celtics. Boston lost for the third time in four games after allowing Utah to shoot a season-high 56 percent from the field. ""As good as we were defensively in the first nine games, I don't think we've been as good the last three,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""I thought we actually did an OK job on the initial drives in isolation, but we didn't get rebounds in a lot of cases. Our pick-and-roll defense, we just have to really shore it up."" The Jazz started to pull away when they hit 3-pointers on each of their final four possessions of the second quarter to take a 58-51 halftime lead. Ingles accounted for the first three long-distance baskets, highlighting a 20-point first half for him. Utah opened the third quarter on a 17-6 run. Mitchell ignited the spurt by draining three free throws and driving for a layup on back-to-back possessions. Derrick Favors kept it going with back-to-back baskets that gave the Jazz a double-digit lead and finished the run off with a pair of free throws that put Utah ahead 75-57 just four minutes into the quarter. ""Defensively, we didn't pay attention to details,"" Rozier said. ""We just didn't have a presence out there, so they played freely."" The Jazz built their lead to 83-63 on a layup by Crowder before Boston rallied in the fourth quarter. The Celtics scored on four straight possessions, culminating in Tatum's layup, to ignite a 15-4 run. Rozier nailed a 3 to cap off the run and cut Utah's lead to 100-96. QUOTABLE ""I mean, they know. I'll leave it at that."" -- Crowder on whether his 20-point performance was motivated by a desire to show the Celtics they made a mistake when they traded him to Cleveland before the 2017-18 season. TIP-INS Celtics: Smart set a season high with 10 assists, one shy of his career high. Smart also scored 13 points for his first double-double of the season. ... Boston had 28 points off 17 Utah turnovers. ... The Celtics gave up a season-high 35 points in the third quarter. Jazz: Ingles made five 3s, moving him ahead of Deron Williams (511) on Utah's career list. Ingles has 512 3-pointers with the Jazz. ... Utah finished with a 45-28 advantage on the boards. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Kings coach Dave Joerger didn't like most of what he saw from his team in the first half against Minnesota. The second half was an entirely different story and had Joerger beaming afterward, even though Sacramento nearly blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. Willie Cauley-Stein had 25 points, Nemanja Bjelica scored eight in a row during a big run late in the third and the Kings beat the slumping Timberwolves 121-110 on Friday night to spoil a huge game for Karl-Anthony Towns. ""I didn't think we played very well in the first half and still had a two-point lead,"" Joerger said. ""We're growing. This is a very good win for us. I think you saw maybe we wore them down a little bit in the second half."" Coming off back-to-back losses to East powers Milwaukee and Toronto, the Kings led by 15 early in the fourth but had to hold off a late surge by Minnesota to end a three-game losing streak to the Timberwolves. Sacramento's high-tempo offense was pivotal on both ends, as Minnesota eventually got tired in the second half. ""We just keep running,"" De'Aaron Fox said. ""Even if they score, we're not worried about that. We're getting the ball up and down the court."" Fox had 16 points and 10 assists for Sacramento. Iman Shumpert scored 17 and Bjelica finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. Towns had a season-high 39 points and 19 rebounds on a night when Minnesota's inconsistent offense sputtered. ""To win you have to play with a certain intensity level and we're not playing well right now,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""It's not any one particular person. It's not any one particular thing. It's all things. Hustle can make up for a lot and so that's what we have to get back to."" The Timberwolves trailed by 14 midway through the fourth before Derrick Rose made consecutive 3-pointers to start a 12-0 run. Minnesota had a chance to tie the game but Jimmy Butler missed two free throws with 3:19 left. Sacramento took advantage of a pair of turnovers and scored the next seven points to pull away. ""We have to do a better job closing,"" Sacramento's Buddy Hield said. ""I messed up on a ball screen at the top of the key. It's on us to lock in mentally and focus."" Rose had 21 points, five assists and six rebounds. Butler was a game-time decision but played 41 minutes and had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The Timberwolves are 0-8 on the road. ""We just didn't play transitional defense,"" Towns said. ""That's what we need to do. That's why we get hit with another `L' on this trip and haven't found a way to win."" Sacramento missed 11 of its first 14 shots and fell behind by 12 early in the first quarter. Cauley-Stein helped rally the Kings in the second, scoring eight points as Sacramento took a 63-61 halftime lead. Towns made his first five shots and was 7 of 9 in the first quarter as Minnesota jumped out to a 12-point lead. He cooled off a bit in the second but made two 3s and had 29 points and eight rebounds by halftime. DELAYS, DELAYS The first half ended on a strange note when the Kings were called for two fouls with 0.6 seconds left, both coming as Minnesota tried to inbound the ball. The Timberwolves made one of the two ensuing free throws and eventually got the ball in, but Taj Gibson missed a 15-footer at the buzzer. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns had nine offensive rebounds. . Two days after setting a franchise record with 20 3-pointers, the Timberwolves failed to find their stroke beyond the arc, going 7 for 25. ...

"TORONTO --  A big effort from the bench helped make up for rare off nights by two of the Raptors' biggest scoring threats. Pascal Siakam scored a career-high 23 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 19 points and 10 rebounds and Toronto beat the New York Knicks 128-112 on Saturday, improving its league-leading record to 12-1. Kawhi Leonard scored a season-low 12 points, failing to reach 20 for the second time in nine games. Kyle Lowry scored 10 points, one better than his season worst. ""That was our focus, to really do a job on those two,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""You've got to pick a poison and their role players really stepped up and made shots."" OG Anunoby scored 16 points, and Serge Ibaka and Delon Wright each had 12 as the Raptors won their sixth straight home meeting with the Knicks, all of them by 10 points or more. Toronto, which has won six straight overall, improved to 7-0 at home. ""Everyone is confident, everyone is working hard and just playing the game,"" Siakam said. ""It doesn't matter what night it is, we just want to go out there and play."" Toronto's 62 bench points were a season high. ""We have one of the deepest teams in the NBA,"" Wright said. ""We can go pretty far into our bench."" The Raptors' Nick Nurse became the first coach to win 12 of his first 13 games since Lawrence Frank started 13-0 with the New Jersey Nets in 2004. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 27 points and Enes Kanter had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who have lost 16 of their past 19 against the Raptors. ""That's why they're so good,"" Hardaway said of Toronto. ""They have that supporting cast that comes in and they take care of business. It's as simple as that."" Siakam shot 6 for 7, including a career-best three 3-pointers, and went 8 for 9 at the free-throw line. Siakam's outburst made up for a quiet night from Leonard, who didn't make his first basket until a layup with 45 seconds to go in the first half. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year shot 2 for 7, missing both of his 3-point attempts. Toronto led 64-53 at halftime, but New York shaved the gap to three points with a 12-4 run to start the second half.

After losing six straight while All-Star forward Anthony Davis struggled with a strained elbow, the Pelicans won their second straight Saturday night, defeating the Phoenix Suns 119-99. Davis led the way with 26 points and 12 rebounds. ""It was real big for us,"" Davis said of the follow-up to a 107-98 home victory against Chicago three nights earlier. ""You know you can't get too far down in the West or it's going to be trouble trying to get back up in the standings, so, for us to come back home and take care of home court, it was big time for us. It gives us a little confidence."" Davis led four Pelicans in double figures, and New Orleans never trailed. Julius Randle also had a double-double, finishing with 22 points and 16 rebounds. Jrue Holiday scored 19 points and E'Twaun Moore had 17. T.J. Warren led the Suns with 25 points, Deandre Ayton scored 20 and grabbed 12 rebounds and Devin Booker scored 12 points. It was the first time in 10 games that New Orleans had a victory by a margin of 10 or more points. The Pelicans dominated on the boards, outrebounding the Suns, 53-37. The Pelicans scored the first seven points of the game and maintained a comfortable margin, but couldn't put away the Suns until midway through the fourth quarter. ""We had leads that we should have extended and tried to close out the game but we could never quite get there,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""The one thing about (the Suns) is they have a bunch of young guys who play hard, but they haven't figured it out yet. They have some great talent and I think they have a great future down there."" New Orleans led by as many as 24 points in the fourth quarter. ""We know that's a good team with a couple of All-Star caliber players,"" Suns coach Igor Koskokov said of the Pelicans.

"MIAMI --  John Wall and Austin Rivers have seen more than enough losing lately. So they decided to do something about it. Wall scored 28 points, he and Rivers each scored 10 in the pivotal fourth quarter and the Washington Wizards got a much-needed win by topping the Miami Heat 116-110 on Saturday night. The Wizards opened the fourth on a 31-12 run, with Wall and Rivers fueling most of that effort. ""It was probably one of our best games, how we played,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We played a physical brand, we fought for one another and I thought we made timely passes and shots."" Jeff Green had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards. Rivers scored 18, as did Bradley Beal, and the Wizards won for only the third time in 12 games to start the season. ""You work hard all summer, throughout the season, to prepare yourself for those type of moments,"" Wall said. ""Austin got into a great rhythm."" Washington opened the fourth on a 31-12 run, before the Heat trimmed what was as much as a 17-point deficit down considerably in the final minutes but never seriously threatened again. Dwight Howard finished with 11 points and 16 rebounds for the Wizards, who outrebounded Miami 48-38 -- the first time Washington won that stat battle all season. The Wizards also got a boost at the foul line, shooting 28 for 38 there compared with 20 for 26 by Miami. ""We had moments where we competed defensively, and we had other moments where I didn't recognize our team,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Josh Richardson scored 24 points and Rodney McGruder had a career-high 22 for the Heat. Wayne Ellington added 16 points, Hassan Whiteside finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds and Tyler Johnson scored 12 points for Miami. The Heat were again without Dwyane Wade, who sat a third consecutive game after the birth of his daughter. Goran Dragic returned after missing Miami's last two games with right knee inflammation, but he struggled and shot 0 for 7 in 21 minutes. Miami led 35-25 after one quarter and pushed its lead out to 12 early in the second, and couldn't finish. Washington was within three by halftime, two going into the fourth and took what was then its largest lead of the night -- six points, 92-86 -- when Wall connected on a foul-line jumper to cap a 9-1 spurt that opened the fourth. And that set the tone for the finish. A night after Washington trimmed a 25-point deficit down to one late but fell in Orlando, it finished the job in Miami. ""There shouldn't be any team that's more desperate than us,"" Ellington said. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington evened the season-series with Miami at 1-1, with both clubs winning on the road. ... Even with the win, going back to last season and including the playoffs, the Wizards are just 8-22 in their last 30 games. ... Green made his first seven shots and finished 8 for 11. ... Howard had seven offensive rebounds. Heat: Kelly Olynyk needed treatment throughout the day after getting kneed in the rib area by Indiana's Tyreke Evans on Friday night. He played but was limited to 13 minutes, scoring five points. ... This was the 20th home back-to-back in Heat history, and only the third time they dropped both ends of such a set. BACK TO BACK Saturday completed the first back-to-back of the season for Washington -- which still has 14 left to play.

"CHICAGO --  Zach LaVine delivered another solid effort for Chicago, yet his only turnover of the game nearly cost the Bulls a victory. LaVine scored 24 points, rookie Ryan Arcidiacono added 15 and the Bulls rebounded after blowing an early 16-point lead to edge the Cleveland Cavaliers 99-98 on Saturday night. Wendell Carter Jr. also had 15 points as Chicago won for the second time in six games. LaVine has scored 20 more points in each of Chicago's 13 games this season and in a career-high 14 straight overall, dating to his final game of 2017-18. The last Bulls player to score 20-plus points in 14 consecutive games was Jimmy Butler, who did it 15 straight times in 2016. ""I thought it was Zach's best game as far as making the simple play,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We've really been on him about making the right play and the right read, and tonight I thought he was really about that when they were blitzing him on the floor."" But Cleveland nearly pulled this one out after LaVine's lone turnover With 13 seconds left, Carter couldn't handle LaVine's pass and Cleveland recovered. Coach Larry Drew called a timeout to set up a final play, but Cavs rookie guard Collin Sexton was blocked by Jabari Parker as he drove to the basket at the buzzer. ""I made a dumb mistake at the end,"" LaVine said. ""I shouldn't have nonchalant passed it to Wendell. That was my bad, but we made a good stand."" The 23-year-old LaVine was flashy at times, scoring on several highlight-reel dunks. Arcidiacono, making his first career start, scored 10 of his points in the first half. ""I thought I was able to get into a rhythm when I got a few defensive possessions and got on the floor once,"" Arcidiacono said. Tristan Thompson had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the league-worst Cavs. Sexton scored a season-high 20 points in his second straight start and second of his career. Still, the 19-year-old couldn't connect on the final shot as he played more than 34 minutes. ""I felt like I got to my spot and that was the right spot,"" Sexton said. ""They told me to take that, I'm going to make it the next time."" Drew said Sexton executed the final play perfectly.  Parker just stopped him. ""We got the shot that we wanted,"" Drew said. ""It was clear off of Collin, he got all the way to the basket and the ball didn't go in."" Rodney Hood also had 20 points and Jordan Clarkson came off the bench to score 15, but the Cavaliers lost their fifth straight. Cleveland's only win this season was on Oct. 30 over Atlanta. Cavs forward Cedi Osman sat out the game with back spasms. He was forced to leave Wednesday's loss to Oklahoma City in the first quarter, becoming the latest Cavs player to join an injury list that includes All-Star forward Kevin Love, point guard George Hill and forward Sam Dekker. The Bulls came out firing, shooting 64 percent from the floor through the first quarter and taking a 37-23 lead as LaVine scored 11 points and Arcidiacono had 10. Then Chicago opened its biggest lead, at 16 points, when Antonio Blakeney hit a running jumper 42 seconds into the second quarter. But Cleveland roared back to tie it 53-all at halftime as it outscored Chicago 30-16 in the second quarter, including a 9-0 run. The Cavs' bench, led by Clarkson with 10 points and Kyle Corver with eight in the quarter, led the comeback. Chicago led 79-77 after three quarters. BUTLER TRADE REACTION Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg thinks Butler, who spent his first six seasons with Chicago, will be ""really good fit"" with the Philadelphia 76ers. Butler is being traded from Minnesota to Philadelphia in a package that sends Dario Saric and Robert Covington to the Timberwolves, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Saturday. ""I think (Philadelphia has) three of the best players at their position in (Joel) Embiid and (Ben) Simmons,"" Hoiberg said. ""He brings a toughness. He's a guy who's a great player in the clutch. He's a player that guys are going to go out there and guard every time he steps on the floor."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Guard Andrew Harrison, signed to a two-way contract, made his debut with the Cavs and played 13 minutes off the bench. He did not score. Harrison made 64 starts over the past two seasons for Memphis, but was waived by the Grizzlies after one game this season. ... With Osman out, JR Smith and Larry Nance Jr. were Cleveland's starting forwards. ... Against the Thunder on Wednesday in his first career start, Sexton played 42 minutes and had 15 points while shooting 7-for-14 from the field. Bulls: Arcidiacono replaced Cameron Payne, who had started in 11 of Chicago's first 12 games, in the starting lineup. Payne didn't play Saturday. ""(Arcidiacono) is a guy who is going to go out there and play with toughness,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's somebody we feel deserves this opportunity to go out there. He gets us extra possessions. He gets you into things offensively.""","401070859"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Mike Conley and the Memphis Grizzlies added a bad ending to an emotional day for the Philadelphia 76ers. Conley scored a season-high 32 points as the Grizzlies claimed a 112-106 overtime victory over the Sixers, who were short-handed and emotionally spent Saturday night after news broke earlier in the day that the team will trade starters Robert Covington and Dario Saric along with reserve Jerryd Bayless to Minnesota for All-Star Jimmy Butler. ""It's kind of that feeling in your stomach of just like, I mean, you can't really explain it. I was in disbelief,"" said guard T.J. McConnell who had 16 points and seven assists. McConnell's eight points in the fourth quarter helped Philadelphia hold a lead before the Sixers went to overtime for the second night in a row. Despite the Sixers being short-handed with none of the potentially traded players dressed for the game, it took a strong effort by Conley after halftime for Memphis to remain undefeated at home through five games at FedExForum. Conley, who entered the game shooting 32 percent from the field in the last five games, converted 12 of 24 shots in the game. That included scoring 13 points in the third quarter, making 6 of 8 shots to help Memphis erase a Philadelphia lead that earlier had reached 16 points. ""I'm not going to lie,"" Conley said, ""These whole last couple of weeks have been like just barely missing, barely not making shots, and missing shots I would normally make and feeling good while doing it."" Marc Gasol scored 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Garrett Temple finished with 17 points, including a 3-pointer -- after an offensive rebound by Gasol -- with 39 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime tied at 102. That was the fourth tie to go with six lead changes in the fourth. In overtime, Memphis built a couple of early four-point advantages before Conley took it to the final six-point margin on two free throws with 7.6 second remaining. ""He's been working his tail off,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""He understands how vital he is to us, the load that he has to bear. He's been getting in extra work."" J.J. Redick led the Sixers with 20 points, while Ben Simmons finished with 18 points and 14 rebounds. Joel Embiid had 14 points and 16 rebounds for Philadelphia, but was 4 of 15 from the field. The game marked the second time in two nights Philadelphia went to overtime. The Sixers defeated the Charlotte Hornets 133-132 in overtime at home Friday night. Asked about the fatigue factor, Sixers coach Brett Brown said: ""I didn't feel it. You think it would, you know with overtime (against Charlotte), flight, overtime (Saturday) and so on. But I didn't feel it."" As for whether emotions of the changing teammates contributed, Redick said: ""I thought we played hard. Us playing back-to-back. Overtime games are tough. I thought we handled ourselves well in that regard. "". As Jerryd Bayless says: The game is the game."" TIP-INS Sixers: The Sixers dressed only nine because of the players involved in the trade were not available. ... Redick has reached double figures in 23 straight games. ... Redick connected on the first six shots in the game. The Sixers are undefeated at home, but 1-6 on the road. . Philadelphia made only one of their 15 shots from outside the arc after halftime.

F Dillon Brooks left the game limping with an injured left knee in the early stages of the second quarter. He did not return. ... Gasol passed 11,000 career points in the first half. ... Bickerstaff drew a technical late in the first half for complaints about officiating regarding Gasol. OUTTA HERE Two courtside fans were ejected in the first half at the direction of Redick. ""Not going to repeat that one,"" the Sixers guard said when asked about the exchange. ""(The fan) said something -- actually twice. It's just not something you should say with women and children around. It was highly inappropriate.""","401070860"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Houston is still ""figuring it out"" a month into the season and the Rockets did not gain any clarity Saturday night against the San Antonio Spurs. LaMarcus Aldridge had 27 points and 10 rebounds and San Antonio held on to beat Houston 96-89 while holding the Rockets to 28 percent shooting in the final quarter. After setting a franchise record for victories in finishing 65-17 last season, the Rockets have already dropped seven games as their offense continues to sputter despite having reigning MVP James Harden and Chris Paul. Houston committed just eight turnovers against San Antonio but shot 33 percent from the field and 22 percent on 3-pointers in dropping their second straight. ""If I knew, I would tell you,"" Paul said of the reasons for the team's offensive woes. ""I don't know. I think what the coach always says, the law of averages will kick in at some point. So, I am expecting us to get unbelievably hot at some point."" Paul, who said the team is trying to figure out changing lineups, was held to 13 points on 4-for-13 shooting. James Harden had 25 points to lead Houston and Eric Gordon added 23. The Rockets' arrival couldn't have come at a better time for the Spurs, who struggled defensively in dropping their previous two games. San Antonio overcame 15 turnovers, including eight in the second quarter. The Spurs closed on an 8-2 run in the final four minutes to pull away for the win. The run was sparked by Derrick White's lone 3-pointer that gave them an 89-85 lead. ""My teammates are confident in me, which has taught me to be confident,"" said White, who tied a career high with 14 points and set a career high with eight assists. DeMar DeRozan had a season-low 13 points, but added 11 rebounds in 39 minutes as San Antonio snapped its two-game skid. The Rockets were without Carmelo Anthony, who missed the game due to an undisclosed illness amid reports he is speaking to the team about his future with the franchise. ""I'm sure you can address that with Daryl (Morey, Houston general manager),"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""I'm trying to coach a game. I'm trying to win a game."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston had won three straight prior to dropping its second straight. ... In addition to Anthony, the Rockets had five other players out with injuries or illness in addition, including Nene (strained right calf) and Michael Carter-Williams (illness). ... F Gerald Green was upset after he tumbled over Quincy Pondexter, who dove for a loose ball at his feet. Green remained on the court for a few seconds and then remained in the backcourt attempting to walk off a limp. Spurs: Bryn Forbes finished with 13 points. Forbes has scored double figures in nine of 11 games this season. The only other Spurs player to top that in his first three seasons was Tim Duncan, who had 10 in 1998. ... White's previous career high was two assists, which he accomplished twice in his rookie season. ... Rookie C Chimezie Metu played a season high 12 minutes with Pau Gasol and Jakob Poeltl out. Metu's previous high was seven minutes. YOU ARE APPRECIATED Popovich, who served five years of active duty in the United States Air Force, was happy the Spurs celebrated ""Military Appreciation Night"" on Saturday. ""It's always great to honor the military because obviously they do a lot more important work than most of us do,"" Popovich said. ""The more that they know we appreciate it the better, because a lot of the trite things that get done get pretty old, even to them. You know how many times when people say, `We'll never forget you' and `Thank you for your service,' and all that sort of thing and everybody moves on and forgets. To establish a whole evening like that across the whole league it's very appropriate and very deserved."" BATTLING A BUG With six players out against San Antonio, D'Antoni said the team is battling sickness and not injuries. ""Some guys got sniffles and everything else, but it is flu season,"" D'Antoni said.","401070861"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Quinn Cook did an admirable job late last season for Golden State when Stephen Curry was hobbled by knee and ankle injuries. With the two-time NBA MVP sidelined again, Cook is ready to do it again. Kevin Durant showed with his passing that he can do a pretty good imitation of Curry, too. Durant had 28 points and 11 assists, Cook scored a season-high 27 and the Warriors used another big run in the third quarter to pull away and beat the Brooklyn Nets 116-100 on Saturday. ""I just feel like Quinn thinks that he's always supposed to be ready no matter what,"" Durant said. ""When his number is called he's able to go out there and produce, and that's just because of the work he puts in every day. It's no surprise to me that he can do this."" Two days after losing Curry to a groin injury in a 23-point home loss to Milwaukee, Golden State bounced back behind Cook with little problem while their leading scorer sat at home watching. Signed on a two-way contract a year ago when he made 18 starts with Curry out, Cook looked just as comfortable this time around. He made his first seven shots and matched Durant with 19 points in the first half, then made a shot-clock beating 19-footer in the third to push the Warriors lead to 103-81. ""That's the mark of a pro,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's a great fit for us. Always prepared and always ready. His role is going to swing wildly based on our health and what's happening out on the floor but he's always ready."" Cook hasn't played much this season but said the experience he got last year was a big factor in keeping him ready when his turn came up. ""Our guys do a great job of always making you feel important, making you feel a part of the team, even when you aren't playing,"" Cook said. ""I felt comfortable out there and we got it done."" Draymond Green was also missing from Kerr's lineup but Durant -- with a lift from Cook -- made both absences a moot point while ending Brooklyn's three-game winning streak. The nine-time All-Star had 13 points in the first quarter, scored the final six of the second then came up big again in the third when the Warriors led by as many as 20. Golden State needed it on a night when their other Splash Brother, Thompson, had an off night shooting. Thompson made four of his first five shots but finished 11 of 20. Joe Harris scored 24 points for the Nets. Spencer Dinwiddie added 14 points and six assists and DeAngelo Russell had 12 points. ""You had Durant and Thompson, and (Cook) did a Curry imitation tonight,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""You could argue he made the difference tonight. He really scored the ball well."" GOTTA BE THE SHOES Dinwiddie has taken full advantage of the NBA's relaxed policy on shoe colors and has worn a different pair each night. Earlier this season Dinwiddie wore a pair of white shoes with a picture of 11-time All-Star Allen Iverson. With the Nets in the Bay Area, Dinwiddie switched things up again and had shoes that were inscribed with the word WITH across the top of one and KAP on the other, along with a picture of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick on the side. TIP-INS Nets: Russell left the game late in the fourth quarter as a precaution after appearing to injure his hand while reaching for the ball. ... Brooklyn has lost eight straight to Golden State. ... The Nets haven't won our consecutive games since a six-game streak in 2014-15. Warriors: Golden State is 51-12 following losses since 2014-15. ... Curry did not play as expected but was feeling better after getting some work in with team trainer Rick Celebrini at the team's downtown facility. ""I saw him this morning,"" Kerr said. ""He had better mobility, less pain so it's a good sign."" The two-time NBA MVP is nursing a mild to moderate left groin strain suffered Thursday in the loss against Milwaukee. ... Green missed his second straight game because of a sprained right toe. ... Shaun Livingston (right foot soreness) was also held out.","401070862"
"DALLAS -- J.J. Barea and Luka Doncic brought experience and youth -- and a win -- to Dallas on Saturday night. Rookie Doncic scored 22 points and veteran Barea had a season-high 21 off the bench, including 16 in a first-half surge, as the Mavericks defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 111-96. The Mavericks won for the second time in nine games and snapped the Thunder's seven-game winning streak after they had lost their first four games of the season. ""Barea was great,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Extremely aggressive, scored it, passed it. He was certainly a big tone-setter for us."" Oklahoma City raced to an early 18-12 lead, but Barea scored 11 points in a foul-filled first quarter, including two free throws for a 23-22 lead at the end of the period. Barea accounted for 16 of the Mavericks' 20 points for a 32-24 lead before returning to the bench. ""Our bench guys got a little mojo going on offense,"" Carlisle said. Dallas built its lead to 24 points, 57-33, before the Thunder scored the last 12 points of the first half. The 34-year-old Barea was the second-oldest Maverick active for the game. He led the way as the Dallas bench outscored Oklahoma City's 53-22. ""I got in a rhythm tonight, feeling good,"" Barea said. ""I was telling the guys on the bench we've got to come in with a lot of energy."" The Mavericks' youngest player, 19-year-old Doncic, scored nine of his points in the third quarter. He came off the court flexing his right knee but returned for the fourth quarter. Doncic, averaging better than 20 points per game, also had a game-high and career-high eight assists. ""He's been great,"" Barea said. ""He's finishing. He's knocking down the 3s, he's driving."" Harrison Barnes and Dorian Finney-Smith scored 11 points each and Dennis Smith Jr. had 10 for Dallas. Paul George and Steven Adams had double-doubles for Oklahoma City, each finishing with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Dennis Schroder added 19 points and Jerami Grant had 13. The Mavericks shot a season-best 56 percent from the field (43 for 77). The Thunder made only 39 percent of their field goal attempts (38 for 97) and couldn't capitalize on 26 offensive rebounds. ""The biggest difference was obviously the 3-point shooting. They shot it really well and we had our opportunities and didn't shoot particularly well,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Dallas made 14 of 29 3-pointers (48 percent) and Oklahoma City only 9 of 34 (27 percent). TIP-INS Thunder: Russell Westbrook missed his third game because of a sprained left ankle. ... The bench scored only two points in the first half on 1-for-13 shooting. ... Raymond Felton, Oklahoma City's oldest player, was born the same day as Dallas' J.J. Barea -- June 26, 1984. Mavericks: Gave up a season-low 96 points -- 13 fewer than their previous low, 109 by Chicago on Oct. 22. ... Held the Thunder to 45 points in the first half, the fewest this season for a Dallas opponent. ... The Mavericks shot 13 for 18 (72 percent) from the field in the second quarter, including 6 of 8 (75) from 3-point range. STARS OUT TONIGHT Dallas played without Dirk Nowitzki, who underwent left ankle surgery during the offseason. The Thunder were without  Westbrook (sprained left ankle) for the third game. ""I'd be thrilled if (Nowitzki) played in November,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I just think he's moving around better."" Oklahoma City's Billy Donovan said of Westbrook: ""Every day, I think he gets better but in terms of projecting a date when he's going to be ready, no."" BENCH MARKS Devin Harris, 35, returned after missing all but this season's opening game because of a strained left hamstring. He contributed six points. Finney-Smith said Harris was a big part of the bench's season-high 53 points. ""We're deep, especially when Devin Harris gets back out there and J.J. (Barea) going like that."" MUST BE THE SHIRTS The Mavericks played in their City Edition jerseys for the first time this season. ""I liked them, that smoke grey,"" Finney-Smith said. ""If that's what it takes to get the win, I'll wear them again.","401070863"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Smoke from the raging Northern California wildfires seeped into the Golden 1 Center, giving LeBron James a headache and leading Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton to shorten his players' stints on the court. But the haze did little to slow James and the Lakers, who used their best defensive effort of the year to earn a 101-86 win Saturday night against the Sacramento Kings, lifting Los Angeles to .500 (6-6) for the first time this season. James scored 25 points and recently signed Tyson Chandler had 12 rebounds for the Lakers, who began the season with three straight losses but now have won four of their last five. The Lakers held the Kings, who entered the game averaging 118 points per contest, to their lowest scoring total of the season. It was only the second time Sacramento has been held below 100 points this season, and it marked the first time Los Angeles had held an opponent below 100. ""We won the game tonight because of our defense,"" Walton said. ""I think we've been showing glimpses of that defense, but tonight was the first time we've been able to put it together for long stretches."" James hit three 3-pointers and had seven rebounds. He only had two assists, though he often fed teammates for open shots that missed -- including Lonzo Ball, who was 2 for 10 from the field. Chandler, playing in his second game with the Lakers, logged 23 minutes and scored three points. In his first game, the Lakers held Minnesota to 110 points -- which, up until Saturday night's game, was tied for the lowest by any Los Angeles opponent this season. ""For me, the defense has been easy because it comes naturally, but it's a matter of getting into the offense,"" Chandler said. ""The key for us was getting back on transition, building walls, forcing them into a half-court offense."" James said the Lakers' center duo of starter JaVale McGee and Chandler, who combined for 20 rebounds and a pair of steals, has solidified a defense that struggled early in the season. ""(Chandler) just shored up our front court. We have a great 1-2 punch now with JaVale and Tyson,"" James said. De'Aaron Fox had 17 of his 21 points in the first half to lead the Kings, who shot 35 percent from the field and went 6 for 25 on 3-pointers. Willie Cauley-Stein added 12 points and 12 rebounds. Fox said the Lakers were able to shut down the Kings' fast-paced offense by getting back quickly on defense. ""They got back every shot attempt and they sent four people back,"" he said. ""And we didn't shoot the ball well."" The Lakers were ahead by six points at the half and held a 76-65 lead entering the fourth quarter. They built that lead to 20 points at 88-68 before the Kings responded with a 10-0 run, but Sacramento got no closer. ON THE REBOUND The Lakers had a season-high 59 rebounds, including a season-best 17 on the offensive end. Five of Chandler's rebounds were offensive, while McGee had three of his eight rebounds on offense. LEBRON'S RETURN James made his NBA debut in Sacramento 15 seasons ago as the No. 1 overall draft pick of the Cleveland Cavaliers. He had 25 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in the Oct. 29, 2003, game in which the Kings defeated the Cavs 106-92. BAD SHOOTING The Kings were held to their worst field goal percentage of the season, going 32 of 92 from the field. They were averaging 49 percent shooting coming into the contest, third best in the NBA. TIP-INS Lakers: Ball missed all six of his 3-point attempts, most of them wide open. ... There were plenty of Los Angeles fans in the stands, and several ""Let's Go Lakers"" chants in the fourth quarter. Kings: Sacramento's 44 points in the first half matched a season low. ... The Kings had scored 100 or more points in each of their seven previous contests. ... Sacramento had a season-low 11 assists.","401070864"
"DETROIT --  Most of the stars of the 2005 NBA Finals have been out of the league for several years. Tony Parker, is still beating the Detroit Pistons. Sunday, he faced them for the first time as a member of the Charlotte Hornets, but the results weren't any different. The 36-year-old scored 24 points in 28 minutes off the bench to lead Charlotte to a 113-103 victory. ""That's what Tony does. I'm just surprised that he never loses any of his speed and quickness,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""He got to every spot he wanted to out there, and we weren't stopping him. ""He's probably going to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but we've got to be better."" Parker improved to 20-11 in the regular season against the Pistons, first playing them as a 19-year-old with San Antonio on Jan. 2, 2002. The Spurs also beat Detroit in seven games in the 2005 finals. ""(Tony) is a leader,"" said Kemba Walker, who had 24 points and seven assists. ""He brings passion and the winning attitude. He just knows how to win."" Cody Zeller added 14 points as Charlotte won for the third time in four games. ""I thought they were great tonight,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""Their effort and their attention to detail were fantastic. I'm really proud of our group on both ends of the floor."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 22 rebounds for the Pistons, and Reggie Bullock had a career-high 23 points, hitting six 3-pointers. Detroit has lost six of eight after a 4-0 start. ""We are our own worst enemies,"" Casey said. ""We have to make shots and we have to stop getting caught out of position on defense. I'm going to have to make sure everyone understands our defensive assignments."" Detroit's Blake Griffin was given a flagrant-2 foul and ejected with 7:06 to play for a shoulder check on Malik Monk. Griffin shot 4-for-16, missing all five 3-pointers, and is 6-for-26 in his last two games. ""We're asking Blake to carry too much of a load right now,"" Casey said. ""He's bringing the ball up the floor, then going into the post and getting hit on every shot. It's taking a toll on him."" The Hornets started the third quarter with a 10-2 run to go ahead 61-51, and only 12 points from Bullock in the quarter kept Detroit within eight going into the fourth. Walker had nine points in the quarter and Charlotte went 6 of 8 on 3-pointers. ""We played hard and we played the right way, but the challenge is not getting frustrated,"" said Reggie Jackson. ""We have to find a way to stay consistent all game."" Charlotte also jumped on the Pistons at the beginning of the fourth. The Hornets scored the first eight points to take a 16-point lead. ""I think it was really about urgency,"" Borrego said. ""It isn't about playing perfect basketball but playing with urgency and aggressiveness for 48 minutes."" Charlotte rookie Miles Bridges, who played at Michigan State, delighted a huge group of friends and family with an uncontested windmill dunk to make it 95-77 with 8:51 left. ""This was great, especially getting the win,"" he said. ""I knew I wasn't going to be a star right away on a team with Kemba, so I'm just adjusting to the league and learning my spots."" TIP INS Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist left early in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle and did not return. Kidd-Gilchrist had 12 points and 12 rebounds in a 133-132 overtime loss at Philadelphia on Friday night. Pistons: Drummond's 20-20 game was the 25th of his career and his 301st double-double. He leads both categories since he joined the NBA in 2012-13.","401070865"
"HOUSTON --  It's more than three weeks into the season and the Houston Rockets finally got their first home win on Sunday night. With the hole they're in early, they'll need plenty more to dig their way out. James Harden scored a season-high 40 points and Chris Paul added 26 to help the Rockets to a 115-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night. ""It's nice to get a win,"" Paul said. ""We've obviously been struggling ... but we've got to keep building."" The Rockets, who had lost the last two games of a season-long five-game road trip, dropped their first four home games. They're 5-7 this season and in 12th place in the Western Conference. Houston was up by 10 with about four minutes left after five quick points by the Pacers, but Harden made two free throws after that to stretch the lead. The Pacers got within 8 on a basket by Cory Joseph with about 90 seconds left, but Paul made a layup a few seconds later to put the game out of reach. Victor Oladipo had 22 for the Pacers, who have lost three of their last four games. ""We knew they were very capable of getting hot even though they hadn't shot the ball well early this season,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We knew they were very capable and tonight they did. It was tough matchups trying to stop those guys."" The win comes as the Rockets deal with a disappointing start to the season and rumors and reports about Carmelo Anthony's status and future with the team. Anthony, who is in his first year in Houston, sat out for the second straight game with an undisclosed illness on a day the New York Times had a sourced report that said he had been told he would soon be waived. General manager Daryl Morey said before the game that the report was ""inaccurate"" and that singling Anthony out as the cause of Houston's struggles was unfair. The Rockets, who entered the game ranking near the bottom of the league with a 3-point shooting percentage of just 31.7, shot 42.6 percent from long-range and made a season-high 20 3s on Sunday night. Harden had eight and Paul added five to lead the way. ""When we're like that we're going to score a bunch of points and if ... our defense can keep improving then we're the team that we want to be,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. Houston had a big lead for most of the second half and was up by 21 entering the fourth quarter after Paul and Harden had piled up 55 points combined in the first three quarters. The Pacers opened the fourth with an 11-2 run, with the last five points from Oladipo to cut the lead to 104-92 with about 7  1/2 minutes left. But Harden, who finished with nine assists and seven rebounds, made all of Houston's points in a 5-2 run to stretch the lead and 109-94. The Rockets led by 22 at halftime but Indiana scored the first 11 points of the third quarter to cut the lead to 76-65. Darren Collison made two 3-pointers in that span and Oladipo added another one. Houston finally scored its first points of the second half when P.J. Tucker made a 3-pointer with about 9  1/2 minutes left in the third. But the Rockets couldn't get much going after that and the Pacers scored five straight points later in the period to cut the lead to 84-74 with about five minutes remaining in the third. Harden got hot after that, making 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to power a 12-3 spurt that extended the lead 97-77 about three minutes later. TIP-INS Pacers: Oladipo received a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing with a referee after fouling Paul. ... Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points and had six assists. ... Collison had 13 points. Rockets: Clint Capela had 18 points and seven rebounds. He bruised his knee in a collision with Oladipo, but D'Antoni said he should be OK.  ... Gerald Green sat out with a sprained right ankle. ... Nene, who has not played this season, remains out with a strained right calf. THEY SAID IT Paul on what he's seen from Anthony in his time in Houston: ""Melo's been great here. That's like a brother to me. I don't know what's being said or whatnot but Melo's been great working hard every day.""","401070866"
"NEW YORK --  Nikola Vucevic and the Orlando Magic got an unwelcome surprise when the lights in their New York hotel rooms all turned on at 3:30 a.m. Sunday. Turns out, they didn't need a full night of sleep -- or even All-Star Aaron Gordon -- to romp over the New York Knicks. Terrence Ross scored 22 points, Vucevic had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and the Magic cruised past the New York Knicks 115-89 on Sunday night. ""We wanted to come out knocking from the beginning, and I think that is how we started the game,"" Vucevic said. ""We took the lead early and we never let them back in the game."" Orlando struggled to start the season, losing six of its first eight. But the Magic shook off a bizarre and restless night to thump the Knicks, even thriving with Gordon on the bench because of a sprained left ankle. Harlem native Mo Bamba played his first NBA game at Madison Square Garden and had 15 points and eight rebounds. Evan Fournier added 12 points for the Magic, who have won two straight and four of five. The Magic made a season-high 17 3-pointers off 42 attempts. ""Coach (Pat) Riley always says it's a make or miss league, and the night where you shoot the ball like that, everything else is going to go your way,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Orlando reeled off 10 straight points to start the game, capped by Vucevic's turnaround jumper that led the Knicks to call a timeout with 7:27 left in the first quarter. Enes Kanter notched his fifth straight double-double with 16 points and 15 rebounds. He put New York on the board with a tip-in layup, ending a string of eight straight misses to make it 10-2, but it was just too late. New York hit just 5 of 23 from the field in the opening period and missed each of their seven 3-point attempts. ""We always seem to have a quarter where nothing's clicking for us. We didn't see the ball go in,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. The Magic closed the first quarter out on a 20-8 run, highlighted by Jerian Grant's 3 with 0.7 seconds left to lead 30-10. Orlando never looked back, leading by 34 points during the fourth quarter. Kevin Knox had 17 points for the Knicks, who've lost two straight and four of five. Mitchell Robinson set a Knicks rookie record with nine blocks, two below the franchise record. ""I can thank coach. He put me in a position to get those blocks,"" Robinson said. New York was held to 33 percent from the field and made just 4 of 27 from deep. TIP-INS Magic: Gordon got injured in the second half of Friday night's victory over Washington. Jerrell Martin started at power forward in his place. ... Orlando's previous high mark behind the 3-point line was 16, Oct. 20 at Philadelphia. ... The 26-point margin was Orlando's largest in a victory at Madison Square Garden in team history. Knicks: The last NBA rookie to post at least nine blocks in a game was Nerlens Noel against Indiana on Feb. 20, 2015. ... New York tied a franchise-best record with 15 blocks. ... Kanter is the first Knicks to post five straight double-doubles in as many games coming off the bench, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. DRESS TO IMPRESS New York unveiled its City Edition Uniform for Sunday night's game which featured a blue and orange trim throughout the jersey and shorts, similar to the set the team wore during the 2015-16 season, paying homage to the 1952-61 Knicks uniform.","401070867"
"DENVER -- Brook Lopez always drew attention in the paint. Now, the Milwaukee Bucks' 7-footer is starting to draw a defensive crowd the moment he crosses the half-court line because of his 3-point shooting. Lopez made a career-high eight 3-pointers, tying the most in a game by a 7-footer in NBA history, and had 28 points to help the Bucks snap an eight-game skid in Denver, beating the Nuggets 121-114 on Sunday night. ""That was an interesting experience,"" Lopez said after the Nuggets began face-guarding him at half court later in the game in a bid to slow down his perimeter shooting. ""I'm just super proud of our team, especially after the Clippers game (a 128-126 overtime loss Saturday on a last-second Los Angeles basket). I think we all feel we let that one get away. To see the way we committed on the defensive end, especially after they made that run to start the fourth. That was so big and I think definitely shows what we're capable of because that's a great team that we just beat."" According to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research, Lopez tied the single-game 7-footer mark of the Chicago Bulls' Lauri Markkanen, from January, and of the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki, who did it in 2004. All five Bucks starters scored in double figures, and four of them had 20 or more points in Milwaukee's first victory at the Pepsi Center since 2010. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists. Khris Middleton had 21 points and Malcolm Brogdon added 20. ""We do not want to be a good team; We want to be a great team,"" Antetokounmpo said after the Bucks withstood the Nuggets' fourth-quarter comeback bid. ""Great teams, no matter what, come back. You've got to keep fighting and keep playing within your game plan and you hope things work. You hope you can knock down shots. That's what we did."" Paul Millsap led the Nuggets with 25 points and Nikola Jokic added 20. Denver has lost three straight. Lopez didn't make a single 3-point shot in his first six NBA seasons, but he's become a reliable threat from deep. He's made at least six 3-pointers in three of his past four games and is shooting 38.8 percent from long range this season. He was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc Sunday. Lopez said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer and his staff have been telling their players to have faith in their shots and their shooting judgment. ""Bud and our entire coaching staff have done a great job instilling that confidence and giving us that belief that when we shoot, it's going to go in,"" Lopez said. ""If you're open and that's your shot, let it fly."" Up by four at the break, the Bucks stretched their lead to 99-88 going into the final quarter after Antetokounmpo connected on an 11-foot step-back jumper with just over a second remaining in the third quarter. The Nuggets chipped away at the deficit and pulled into a 103-all tie on a 3-pointer by Jamal Murray with little more than 8 minutes remaining. The game remained tight until Brogdon connected on a 3-pointer and Middleton hit a jumper around successive Nuggets' turnovers to give the Bucks a 117-112 lead with 41.6 seconds remaining. Millsap answered by driving in for a dunk, but Middleton offset that with a pair of free throws. The Nuggets did not score again. ""I think turnovers are tough late to overcome, especially live-ball turnovers,"" the Nuggets' Mason Plumlee said. ""We just have to take care of the ball and get good shots and then make or miss. We can live with the make or a miss."" Plumlee added, ""This is our first little bit of adversity, so we have respond. We have to come out and play really well our next home game."" Nuggets coach Mike Malone lamented Denver's lack of defensive intensity for much of the game. ""Give [the Bucks] credit. They made shots,"" Malone said. ""We had breakdown after breakdown after breakdown."" Milwaukee scored 30 or more points in each of the first two quarters and led 63-59 at the half. TIP-INS Bucks: D.J. Wilson continues to mend from a right hamstring strain that has kept him on the sideline this season, but he is getting very close to a return. ... Eighteen of Lopez's points came in the third quarter, when he connected on six of his 3-pointers. Nuggets: Will Barton, who underwent surgery Oct. 23 to repair hip and core muscles, has begun rehab work. There is no set timetable for his return. He was injured Oct. 20 against Phoenix.","401070868"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Al-Farouq Aminu says he's grateful his teammates trust him in the big moments. Aminu hit a pair of late 3-pointers and the Portland Trail Blazers won their fourth straight game, holding off the Boston Celtics 100-94 on Sunday night. Damian Lillard had 19 points and 12 assists while Jusuf Nurkic added 18 points and 17 rebounds. The Blazers have won seven of their last eight games. ""It's good that we're continuing with it, that we trust each other in all situations, the beginning of the game and at the end of the game,"" Aminu said. Jayson Tatum matched his regular-season career high with 27 points and Kyrie Irving added 21 for the Celtics, who finished their road swing 1-4. The Blazers led by as many as 21 points in the game, but the Celtics went on a 13-2 run to start the fourth quarter and pulled to 85-83. Marcus Morris' 3-pointer tied it at 86 with 7:27 left, but Lillard answered with a basket to keep Portland out front. Irving's 3-pointer with 2:55 left closed the Celtics to 92-91. Aminu came back with a 3-pointer from distance for the Blazers. He made another key 3 at put Portland up 100-94 with a minute left. Aminu finished with 11 points and nine rebounds. ""We gave ourselves a chance to win the game and to Aminu's credit, he was 1-for-5 going into those last two 3-pointers and the one was from about 28 feet, so you have to tip your cap off to him,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. The Blazers wrapped up their homestand 5-1. ""We've found ways to win. Different people have it going at different times. I think they've been team wins, we're finding different people at different times,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""We're playing with confidence and poise."" Irving returned to the Celtics after missing Friday's loss at Utah because he was at his grandfather's funeral. Celtics forward Daniel Theis, who sustained a plantar fascia tear on Oct. 27, was upgraded to ""probable"" before the game but Stevens said he would only be available on a minute restriction. Theis played for five minutes and had two rebounds. Lillard's layup put the Blazers up 23-12 in the opening quarter and Portland led by as many as 12 points before Boston closed the gap to 28-26 on Terry Rozier's floater. It didn't last long and Meyers Leonard's 3-pointer gave Portland a 40-31 lead midway through the second quarter. Portland went into the break ahead 54-37, led by Nurkic with 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Celtics got to 61-52 in the third quarter after Tatum's 3-pointer, but CJ McCollum answered with a 3 for the Blazers. Kyrie Irving's 3 closed the Celtics to 71-66, one of seven 3-pointers Boston hit in the third. The Blazers went into the final quarter up 83-70. ""We had our chances, we had our opportunities and they made some key plays, some key shots, and there was a possession there we couldn't get a rebound. And Aminu hit two big 3s,"" Al Horford said. The Celtics were coming off a 123-115 loss to the Jazz, which marked Gordon Hayward's first trip back to Salt Lake City after going to Boston as a free agent in the summer of 2017. Hayward fractured his tibia in the Celtics' opener and missed all of last season. Portland was coming off a 116-105 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday. ""I liked the way we've done it,"" Lillard said about Portland's early season success. ""I think it's been by committee, everybody's been pretty consistent and we've been sharp. I think down the stretch, we usually in the past, we were a lot more up and down. I think this year, we're just getting it done. We're doing the things we need to do to win games and we're doing it consistently."" TIP INS Celtics: Tatum led the Celtics at the break with 13 points. ... The Celtics attempted 18 3-pointers in the third quarter alone, and 42 for the game. They made 14. ... Boston had a three-game winning streak over the Blazers going into the game. Trail Blazers: Portland wore its new City Edition jerseys that are black and gray with a diagonal red stripe. ... There was a delay to start the second half because something with the south basket was askew. A ladder was brought in to allow arena personnel to adjust it. ON THE ROAD: The loss capped a disappointing road trip for the Celtics. ""We just don't hunt great on offense until it's desperation time and we've spent a lot of time in desperation time on this trip,"" Stevens said.","401070869"
"LOS ANGELES --  Tyson Chandler had quite a week with the Lakers. Plucked from last-place Phoenix, Chandler played a key defensive role in his first three games with his new team, helping them win three straight for the first time this season. LeBron James dunked for the winning basket with 15 seconds to go and Chandler blocked Trae Young's driving layup to preserve a 107-106 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night. James shouted and hugged Chandler in celebration of the Lakers' fifth win in six games. ""I find myself acting like a kid in a candy store again,"" said Chandler, who couldn't hear James amid the din of music and cheering. ""I said, `That's my dawg,"" James yelled across the Lakers' locker room. Chandler's defense helped the Lakers prevail in wins against Minnesota and at Sacramento after having his contract bought out and coming to Los Angeles on Tuesday. ""He's been big,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Not only the way he is on court but the way he talks in the huddles. Very happy to have him."" James scored 26 points and Kyle Kuzma added 18 points. Chandler had three blocks. Kuzma's layup tied the game at 104-all with 1:34 to go. Kent Bazemore was called for a technical for yelling at the referees at the end of that play and Kuzma made the free throw for a 105-104 lead. Vince Carter dunked to put the Hawks back up 106-105. ""Vince is every bit of half man and half amazing. Whoever coined that years ago was right on,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Who knew he'd still be able to impact games at 41 years old?"" James got fouled at the other end and missed both. But the Lakers got the offensive rebound and several of them batted the ball around trying to get it to the rim. Kuzma charged into the paint amid three defenders for a shot from the left side. It missed. James was waiting on the right, dunking for a 107-106 lead. ""All of a sudden, the beast comes out of nowhere for the win,"" Chandler said. Taurean Prince led the Hawks with 23 points, Bazemore added 21 and Trae Young had 20 for Atlanta, which still has just one road win on the season. ""It was a battle for sure. The way the whole game went, back and forth,"" Young said. ""They made a lot of plays, we made a lot of plays. I feel like I could have done a little bit more to help get my team the win."" Alex Len's dunk started a 7-0 run that put Atlanta ahead 102-98 in the fourth. James' basket drew the Lakers within one, but then he missed two long jumpers on the same possession. The Hawks trailed by nine to start the fourth. Their first three baskets in the fourth came on 3-pointers by Prince (two) and Young (one). The Lakers dominated the third, outscoring Atlanta 32-22 to take an 84-75 lead into the fourth. James' dunk that tied the game midway through the second quarter got started with Rajon Rondo. He tossed up an alley-oop pass that Brandon Ingram batted back as he ran out of bounds to a trailing James, who provided the thunderous finish. TIP-INS Hawks: They haven't beaten the Lakers at Staples Center since March 4, 2016. ... Prince was called for a flagrant-1 foul on James in the first quarter. ...

They've won five in a row against the Hawks and are 24-5 against them at home since 1991. MOMENT OF SILENCE The Lakers had a moment of silence to honor the 12 people killed in the bar shooting in ThousandOaks earlier in the week. Public address announcer Lawrence Tanter read each name and both teams wore T-shirts with ""Enough"" on the front and the victims' names on the back, something started by the Bucks and Clippers a day earlier.","401070870"
"WASHINGTON --  Just maybe, the Washington Wizards are figuring things out. John Wall had 25 points and 10 assists, Bradley Beal added 21 points and the Wizards won consecutive games for the first time this season, beating the Orlando Magic 117-109 on Monday night. Jeff Green added 18 points off the bench on 6-of-7 shooting. He hit four 3-pointers for Washington, which lost at Orlando on Friday night to fall to 2-9 before winning at Miami. This from a team that has made the playoffs four of the past five seasons and entered this one with relatively minor roster changes. ""It gives us a lot of confidence, defending home court,"" said Green, who joined Dwight Howard and Austin Rivers as Washington's substantial offseason additions. ""But we can't dwell too much on these two wins. We still have a lot of work to do."" The Wizards made 24 free throws on 33 attempts, including 13 of 18 in the fourth quarter, while earning 22 more foul shots than the Magic ""The difference in the game was they got in the bonus early in the fourth quarter,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""To win on the road, we scored 26 in the fourth. That's got to be enough to win. But if you're going to put them at the free-throw line that much, it's going to be hard to do."" Terrence Ross scored 21 points off the bench to lead Orlando, which saw a two-game winning streak snapped. Aaron Gordon had 18 points and 10 rebounds a night after he was scratched with a sprained ankle, and Nikola Vucevic had 17 points and 11 rebounds. Two of Green's six baskets came during a decisive 14-4 Washington run. His fourth 3-pointer of the night, from the right wing off Wall's feed, gave the Wizards a 99-94 lead. He followed that with an alley-oop dunk, also on Wall's assist, to push the lead to five again. ""That's what we got Jeff for,"" Wall said. ""He's able to knock down shots but also do a great job defending one through five, putting the ball on the floor and creating for other guys."" From there, Wall hit a pair of contested fadeaways and then a pair of free throws to make it 108-98 with 4:00 left, Washington's largest lead of the night. GIVE THEM A REASON With an announced crowd of 15,346 Monday night that appeared smaller, Rivers said it's on his team to bring fans back after a poor start. ""We've got to give a reason for the crowd to come to the game,"" Rivers said. ""It was empty, man. It was like a high school state championship game."" SIXTH MAN SENSE Ross is making a strong early case for consideration for the NBA's sixth man award if he remains in his current bench role. Monday marked his third time scoring 20 or more points in 14 games, all as a reserve, and his 10th reaching double figures. WISE WITH WALL Wall played only 33 minutes, his fewest this month after going 40 or more in Washington's previous three games. ""To be quite honest I've been playing John a little bit too much,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Not that his body can't handle it. ... But I've got to be wise. Tonight I definitely wanted to keep his minutes at a respectable number.""

"MIAMI --  Joel Embiid did whatever he wanted, and Jimmy Butler had to be thrilled. It's now time to see what they'll do together. Embiid scored 35 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, JJ Redick added 25 points and the Philadelphia 76ers added to Miami's early-season struggles by topping the Heat 124-114 on Monday night. The win came hours after the 76ers finalized a trade with Minnesota to land Butler, the four-time All-Star who was in Philadelphia and not with the club in Miami. ""It's hard to win on the road in this league, especially when you don't have your full team,"" Redick said. Having Embiid helped. It was the second time in a four-day span that Embiid went for at least 35 and 18; he had 42 points and 18 rebounds on Friday against Charlotte. Embiid was also 16 for 20 from the foul line -- marking the ninth time that a player took at least 20 free throws against Miami and the first since LeBron James did it on Feb. 4, 2010. ""The way he has been dominating, it truly doesn't surprise me,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""I will admit, when I come back and I see the stat sheet, I'm shocked at how dominating at times he is."" Furkan Korkmaz scored 16 and Ben Simmons and Mike Muscala each had 13 for Philadelphia. Butler will be introduced at the 76ers' facility in Camden, New Jersey, on Tuesday, before he flies to Orlando and makes his debut with Philly on Wednesday night against the Magic. Goran Dragic scored 22 points for Miami, which got 17 from Josh Richardson and 14 from Wayne Ellington. The Heat have dropped three straight, all of them at home. Miami was called for 30 fouls -- five each on centers Hassan Whiteside and Kelly Olynyk, who were both limited to 22 minutes. The Heat also had 12 turnovers in the second half. ""Some costly ones, momentum-changing ones,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. It was the first meeting between the clubs since last season's playoffs, when Philadelphia ousted Miami in five games in the first round. And while Philadelphia led most of the way in this one, the 76ers never really pulled away until the final moments. Their first double-digit lead of the night came on Embiid's step-back 3-pointer with 1:59 remaining. Simmons got loose for a dunk on the next Philadelphia possession, and that was the signal for most Miami fans to start heading to the exits. ""It's time. It's definitely time to start looking in the mirror,"" Richardson said after Miami fell to 5-8. ""It shouldn't have gotten to this point but it's definitely time to start cracking down and problem-solving."" TIP-INS 76ers: Rookie Landry Shamet is now wearing No. 1 -- he was No. 23, which will be worn starting Wednesday by Butler. ... Embiid got his 14th double-double in 15 games this season. ... The 76ers scored exactly 32 points in each of the first three quarters, before settling for a mere 28 in the fourth. Heat: Dwyane Wade missed his fourth consecutive game because of the birth of his daughter. He'll miss at least the next three games as well. ... Miami has had a pair of four-game homestands already this season, and has gone 3-5 in those games. ... Whiteside had 13 points and 11 rebounds, and Olynyk scored 13 for Miami. SHOELESS SNAP Miami needed only 126 seconds of the second quarter to go on a 15-0 run, one that was snapped by a 3-pointer from Redick -- who was coming out of one of his sneakers at the time. Redick lost his left shoe one possession earlier, tried in vain to get it on properly, and wound up swishing a 3 with it still askew. THANKING VETS On Military Appreciation Night, the Heat -- who have paid tribute to veterans in pregame ceremonies for years -- honored one of their own. Derric Franklin, who served eight years in the Army and was deployed in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was the honoree. Franklin is the coach of the Heat team in the NBA 2K League, and was surprised on the court by his mother and stepfather.","401070872"
"TORONTO --  E'Twaun Moore doesn't need much to get on a shooting roll. ""I hit one and I feel like I'm on fire,"" he joked. Then he helped cool off the Toronto Raptors. Anthony Davis had 25 points and a season-high 20 rebounds, Moore scored a season-high 30 points and the New Orleans Pelicans beat Toronto 126-110 on Monday night, snapping the Raptors' six-game winning streak. Moore connected on 13 of 18 attempts, going 3 of 5 from 3-point range. ""Without his performance, we don't win this game,"" Davis said. ""Once he gets hot, he gets hot. It opened up a lot of things for our team. He played huge for us tonight."" Moore was 5 of 6 in the first quarter and made sure the Raptors would not mount any kind of comeback in the fourth by making five of his final six shots. ""I was in a good rhythm,"" he said. ""Any time you're in a good rhythm, feeling good, you've got to be aggressive and take it."" Jrue Holiday had 29 points and matched a season high with 14 assists, and Julius Randle added 17 points and 12 rebounds as New Orleans won its third straight following a six-game losing streak. ""Jrue had a great floor game and he was fantastic defensively,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""If Kawhi (Leonard) goes 7 for 20, you've done an outstanding job on him."" The Pelicans outscored the Raptors 72-42 in the paint and snapped a six-game losing streak against Toronto. Pascal Siakam scored 22 points, Leonard had 20 and Serge Ibaka had 19 points and 14 rebounds as the Raptors lost for the first time in eight home games this season. Toronto entered with an NBA-best 12-1 record but allowed a season high in points. ""Tough night,"" Siakam said. ""They did everything better than us."" Toronto's only other defeat this season was a 124-109 loss at Milwaukee on Oct. 29. That was the first of a back-to-back for the Raptors, meaning Leonard sat out to rest. Many in the sellout crowd of 19,800 headed for the exits after Leonard turned the ball over with with 4:05 remaining and the Pelicans up 118-104. ""We let them get to where they wanted to on the court,"" Toronto's Kyle Lowry said. ""We just didn't play our brand of basketball."" It was an especially tough night for Lowry, who had 11 assists but shot 1 for 9, missing six times from 3-point range. He scored a season-low four points and didn't make his first basket until a layup with just under four minutes to play and the Raptors trailing by double digits. New Orleans snapped a five-game road losing streak and won away from home for the first time since a 131-112 victory at Houston on Oct. 17, its first game of the season.

"CHICAGO --  The Dallas Mavericks didn't need a big contribution from Luka Doncic to beat the Chicago Bulls. Harrison Barnes and J.J. Barea took care of that. Barnes scored a season-high 23 points and the Mavericks overcame a sluggish performance by their prized rookie to beat the Bulls 103-98 Monday night. Barea added 14 points, five rebounds and five assists, and the Mavericks won for the third time in four games after losing six in a row, even though Doncic struggled. The leading scorer among NBA rookies, Doncic finished with 11 points on 3-of-12 shooting. ""Sometimes, (Doncic)'s gonna have bad games,"" Barea said. ""He's still young, and he can't be great every game. So we've got to help him out."" The Mavericks led by as many as 14 points and never trailed after the first quarter. But they struggled to put this one away, with Chicago pulling within a point four times in the second half. Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 26 points. Jabari Parker scored all but two of his 16 points in the second half. LaVine's breakaway windmill dunk cut Dallas' lead to 58-57, but Dennis Smith Jr. responded with a 3-pointer.

I'm not coming back,"" Ingles said with a laugh when asked about Memphis. ""My shoulder's sore, my toes, everything. They play hard. The way we play, the way they play, it's always going to kind of be gritty and tough."" Ingles ended up needing stitches when he suffered a cut over his left eye in the fourth quarter. And that was the theme of the night -- a game that was low-scoring, full of bad shooting, turnovers and other mistakes on both ends of the floor. The Jazz shot 39 percent for the game and committed 15 turnovers, while Memphis connected on 42 percent of its shots, but was only 4 of 24 from outside the arc, along with 16 miscues. Toss in 53 fouls, and the game lacked any flow. ""I think the game got kind of choppy the way it was being called,"" Memphis coach J. B. Bickerstaff said. ""We lost our rhythm."" Mike Conley led Memphis with 24 points, while Marc Gasol added 16. Jaren Jackson Jr. and MarShon Brooks finished with 10 points each, and Jackson had 11 rebounds. Memphis defeated the Jazz twice in Utah -- 92-84 on Oct. 22, and 110-100 on Nov. 2 -- and the Jazz didn't want to lose the series with the Grizzlies a month into the season. ""It's a great win,"" Gobert said. ""That's a very tough team and a very smart team. . It was a battle and we got the win."" After Memphis led 43-40 at the half, neither team could gain much separation in the early stages of the third quarter. The game was tied five times and the lead changed four times in the first seven minutes of the third. The Jazz broke open a close game in the final six minutes with a 14-5 run. Gobert had eight points in the stretch as Utah built its lead to 11 points in the late stages. ""I think we just kept playing,"" Gobert said of Utah's second-half performance. ""It's hard when it's a very physical game. You have to keep grinding. We kept grinding again, and eventually we got buckets down the stretch and got stops."" TIP-INS Jazz: After playing Memphis three times in the first month of the season, the teams don't play again until March 8. ...

Memphis was the last Western Conference team to lose its first home game. MEDICAL REPORT Memphis announced before the game that reserve swingman Dillon Brooks will miss six to eight weeks with a left knee sprain suffered in the first half against Philadelphia on Saturday. Brooks had played 93 straight games since he came into the league last season, before he sat Monday night. Additionally, forward Chandler Parsons continues to deal with right knee and back soreness. No timetable was given for his return, other than to say his situation will be updated in two weeks. HEADBAND JOE Ingles suffered the cut over his left eye in the fourth quarter and the Jazz training staff went to work on sealing it shut. When the forward returned to the floor, he had a medical bandana wrapped around his head to cover the cut. Apparently, that led to ""Headband Joe"" trending on social media in Utah.

Jeff Teague returned from a six-game absence to score 24 points for Minnesota, which snapped a five-game losing streak. ""It's good to get a win after the slide we've been having,"" Towns said. ""It doesn't matter how it comes, pretty or ugly. As long as it ends up being a win, we're good with that."" The Nets lost LeVert to what appeared to be a severe right leg injury late in the first half that brought the entire crowd at Target Center to a silence. LeVert spent several minutes on the court being attended by medical personnel. Nets players surrounded their injured teammate before he was wheeled off the court. ""I just think it's a devastating blow for us, for him. That's all I really want to say about this,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Our thoughts should be with him and his recovery. And I really don't want to talk about the game or anything else."" The Timberwolves officially dealt Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, along with big man Justin Patton. The Wolves received Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick in the trade. Butler had asked for a trade earlier in the season but coach and president of basketball of operations Tom Thibodeau said Monday that the team tried to remain patient in waiting for the right deal for the All-Star. Thibodeau refuted a report that Butler's trade demand included sending him to only a handful of teams. In the first game of the post-Butler era, Minnesota used a strong effort from the backcourt duo of Teague and Derrick Rose, who had 23 points in 39 minutes. Teague was aggressive on offense for Minnesota in his first game since Oct. 29. ""We needed the downhill play and the attack,"" Thibodeau said. ""I thought he and Derrick put a lot of pressure on them."" A former first-round pick in his third season, LeVert was averaging a team-high 19 points entering the game. He had 10 points, five rebounds and four assists before suffering the injury with just a few seconds remaining before halftime. LeVert was taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Players from around the league tweeted out their support for LeVert shortly after the injury occurred. ""There were really just no words,"" said Nets forward Joe Harris. ""We didn't talk even when we came in at halftime. There's nothing really to be said. You could just feel it, the emotions from everybody. Guys were crying coming in, it was really that horrific just to see."" D'Angelo Russell made a career-high nine 3-pointers and scored 31 points for the Nets, who shot a season-worst 39.6 percent from the field. Neither team led by more than five points until late in the third quarter, when Gorgui Dieng's 3-pointer and a pair of free throws by Teague extended Minnesota's advantage to 10 points. Brooklyn cut it to 97-96 early in the fourth before the Wolves pulled away. Minnesota overcame a season-high 23 turnovers. TIP-INS Nets: C Jarrett Allen missed the game due to illness. Allen has averaged 11.4 points and 7.8 rebounds this season. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson started at center. ... Brooklyn's bench outscored Minnesota's reserves 40-18, including 14 from Spencer Dinwiddie. Timberwolves: Teague had been out with a bruised left knee. ... SF Andrew Wiggins (right quad contusion) was back after sitting out Minnesota's game Friday at Sacramento. .. Minnesota is now 5-1 at home and 0-8 on the road. WOLVES PLAYERS PRAY FOR LEVERT As LeVert was on the court following his leg injury, Anthony Tolliver huddled his teammates together for a prayer. ""It's really a tough situation, because we all know that could be us,"" Tolliver said. ""We just know that sick feeling. We definitely wanted to do what we could. I got the guys together and prayed for him."" Rose noted that he's been on the court when three players suffered serious leg injuries: Paul George, Gordon Hayward and now LeVert.","401070876"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Once the Oklahoma City Thunder got going, the Phoenix Suns couldn't stop them. Paul George matched his season high with 32 points and went 6 of 10 from 3-point range, Dennis Schroder added 20 points and nine assists, and the Thunder beat the Suns 118-101 on Monday night. Oklahoma City scored 22 straight points in the first quarter, holding the Suns scoreless for nearly seven minutes, to take a 24-5 lead. The Thunder never trailed again and led by as many as 28 points in the second quarter before settling for a 64-40 halftime lead. The Suns whittled that margin down to seven points in the fourth quarter but came no closer. ""As a group, I thought we sensed the energy,"" George said. ""I felt we were the more aggressive team. . I thought we just jumped on them. Once you get one stop, you get another, and at that point, we were just in a groove. We felt good out there."" The Thunder have won eight of their last nine games after a 0-4 start while the Suns have lost four straight and 11 of their last 12. Two of those losses have come in Oklahoma City. The Thunder were 13 of 27 on 3-point attempts. The Thunder played a fourth straight game without star guard Russell Westbrook, who sat out with a sprained left ankle on his 30th birthday. They didn't need him against Phoenix, thanks to George, Schroder and Steven Adams, who had 18 points, seven rebounds, three steals and two blocked shots. T.J. Warren led the Suns with 21 points while Devin Booker had 19 points and six assists. ""The way we opened the game, no presence, no life whatsoever,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We were behind 20 points in the first quarter. That's hard. It put us in a situation that we have to compete and play the whole game and every possession has got to be perfect. You're looking for that spark, looking for that energy to bring us back in the game. I'm glad we found it. We were competing. We never quit."" Schroder -- who started the game 1 of 11 from the field -- hit consecutive 3-pointers off passes from George (who had six assists and eight rebounds) to give the Thunder a 78-55 lead in the third quarter. Phoenix scored 12 straight points, though, and trailed only 86-75 at the end of the period. A 3-pointer by Jamal Crawford pulled the Suns within 93-86 with 7:56 left, but the Thunder had a 15-4 run and weren't challenged again. ""When we get out and go, we're a really good team,"" George said. ""When we get a little stagnant is when we struggle. That's all it came down to."" The Thunder are 16-4 against the Suns at home (after once being 0-3) and have won 23 of their last 29 games overall against Phoenix. The teams will play again Saturday in Phoenix and will wrap up their season series on Dec. 28, also in Phoenix. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix's 13 first-quarter points were the lowest by a Thunder opponent in an opening quarter this season . Warren has 20 3-pointers this season in 13 games after making 20 in 65 games last season. Thunder: George's six 3-pointers were the most in a game by a Thunder player this season . Schroder received a technical foul in the third quarter . The two boxers who will fight at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday for the WBO welterweight title, reigning champ Maurice Hooker and Alex Saucedo of Oklahoma City, both attended the game. MASTER CLASS Adams often got the best of Phoenix rookie Deandre Ayton, leaving him befuddled at both ends of the court, particularly during the first half. Ayton finished with 14 points, but only four in the first half as Oklahoma City built a 28-point lead. Adams, who routinely scored around and over Ayton, was charitable when discussing the rookie. ""He's good, mate. He'll be fine. He's just a rookie. He's figuring his way. He'll be a good player.""","401070877"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Ending a 14-game losing streak that spanned nearly four years to the San Antonio Spurs didn't mean as much to Sacramento as finishing its quick four-game homestand with an even record. It's understandable, since many of these young Kings were still in high school the last time Sacramento beat the Spurs. Iman Shumpert made a tiebreaking jumper with 4:05 remaining, De'Aaron Fox and Nemanja Bjelica followed with 3-pointers and the Kings pulled away for a 104-99 victory on Monday night. ""Man, I don't really care about the streak,"" Sacramento center Willie Cauley-Stein said. ""More or less that was a must-win game. We have to defend home, you know? We slipped up and missed one last game so this one was a must-win mentality coming in. We got it."" The Kings had lost two of their three games on this homestand, including a 101-88 defeat to the Lakers on Saturday in the second half of a back-to-back. Rested and back to its running ways, Sacramento took advantage of an injury-riddled Spurs team to beat San Antonio for the first time since Nov. 15, 2014. It certainly left an impression on Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ""Their culture is changing,"" Popovich said. ""Guys are committed, guys are physical, taking some pride in defense. They look really good."" Fox finished with 19 points and seven assists. Cauley-Stein had 13 points and 13 rebounds, and Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 22 points for the Kings. Sacramento led the entire third quarter but didn't shake San Antonio until late in the fourth. DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge made back-to-back long jumpers to tie the score at 90-all with 5:11 remaining. The Spurs went cold after that and made three baskets down the stretch, all of them 3-pointers. Shumpert broke the tie with his 16-foot jumper. Aldridge had 14 points and 18 rebounds. DeRozan scored 23 points with eight assists, and Rudy Gay added 14 points and nine rebounds in his return to the Spurs lineup. ""There was just a bunch of miscommunication, switching, and a lot of things that caused us to collapse,"" DeRozan said. ""They took an advantage of it and hit the three shots when they needed them. They exploited us and made us turn the ball over when we made a mistake."" Bogdanovic had 11 points off the bench in the first half while Fox hit a pair of 3-pointers to help give the Kings a 56-55 lead at the break after San Antonio made a late run. Sacramento took advantage of the Spurs' cold shooting in the third to take control. San Antonio made more free throws (eight) than it did baskets (six) in the quarter. TIP-INS Spurs: Pau Gasol (left foot soreness) missed his third consecutive game. ... Gay, who spent three-plus seasons with the Kings before signing with San Antonio last year, missed the three previous games because of right heel soreness. Kings: Two nights after having only nine assists in a loss to the Lakers, Sacramento dished out 27 against San Antonio. ... The Kings had a 45-32 advantage in bench points. . Kosta Koufos (right calf) did not play. BOGEY'S BACK The Kings are continuing to be cautious with Bogdanovic as he recovers from a pair of knee procedures in the offseason. Bogdanovic played nearly 25 minutes against the Spurs and shot 9 of 17 with three 3s. ""He's trying to find his rhythm a little bit and he's also playing with some guys that maybe he hasn't played with before,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""But I thought he was really feeling it and did a terrific job.""","401070878"
"LOS ANGELES --  Lou Williams couldn't hit a lick in regulation, so of course he had the ball in crunch time. The Los Angeles Clippers wouldn't have it any other way. Williams scored the Clippers' final 10 points in overtime after they blew a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, and they hung on Monday night to beat the Golden State Warriors at home for the first time in nearly four years, 121-116. Williams recovered after shooting 3 of 16 in regulation, when the Clippers were scoreless over the final 5:15 while the Warriors ran off 11 straight points to force overtime tied at 106-all. ""There would be no point for me to be on the floor if I didn't have confidence,"" said Williams, who finished with 25 points. Montrezl Harrell added 23 points off the bench and rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 18. ""It's not about the run they go on,"" Harrell said. ""It's about how we handle it. We stayed after it and kept going after them."" The Clippers snapped a seven-game skid against the Warriors at Staples Center, where they last won on Dec. 25, 2014. ""Unfortunately we lost, but we'll see them again at least three more times and that'll be different,"" Klay Thompson said. Kevin Durant had 33 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for the Warriors before fouling out with 3:46 left in the extra session. Thompson added 31 points, but was just 5 of 16 on 3-pointers on a night without injured fellow Splash Brother Stephen Curry. ""Everything changes without Steph,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's one of the best offensive players in the history of the game so you take him out and they don't have to worry about as much."" Golden State lost for just the third time in 14 games. The starless Clippers improved to 6-1 at home. Thompson's 3-pointer tied it 116-all in overtime, interrupting Williams' run of 10 straight points for the Clippers. ""He's been playing the same game for like 10 years now,"" Shaun Livingston said of Williams. ""He's just a handful to guard."" Down 106-95, the Warriors closed regulation on an 11-0 run, with Thompson scoring their last eight points. His second 3-pointer in the spurt tied it at 106. The Clippers crashed the boards -- every player grabbed at least one -- and they dominated in the paint, 62-36. Williams' 3-pointer gave Los Angeles its largest lead of 101-87 after they didn't go up by double digits until Harrell's basket to open the fourth. The Warriors were held to 20 points in the third when they were outscored by six. ""I told our guys to empty the gun at the beginning of the third,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Our whole goal was to get more shots than them."" The Clippers shot 60 percent and led 64-61 at halftime. TIP-INS Warriors: They fell to 39-60 in regular-season games without Curry (left groin strain), who missed his second straight game and didn't make the quick trip. ... F Draymond Green returned to the lineup after sitting out two games with a right foot-toe sprain. ... G Livingston was back after being out seven games with right foot soreness. ... They haven't left California during a seven-game stretch that concludes Tuesday. Clippers: Hall of Famer Bill Russell sat courtside with owner Steve Ballmer.","401070879"
"CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Cavaliers are dealing with so many injuries they needed an assistant coach to suit up for practice Monday. A little over 24 hours later they did just fine with their healthy players. Jordan Clarkson scored 24 points, Tristan Thompson had 21 rebounds and 11 points, and Cleveland won for the second time this season, beating the Charlotte Hornets 113-89 on Tuesday night. The Cavaliers (2-11) broke a five-game losing streak. Cleveland's first win came against Atlanta on Oct. 30. Cleveland's injury list grew longer while the losses piled up. Forwards Kyle Korver (sore right foot) and Cedi Osman (back spasms) didn't play Tuesday and are the most recent additions. All-Star forward Kevin Love (foot surgery), starting point guard George Hill (hamstring) and forward Sam Dekker (ankle) have also been sidelined. Cavaliers coach Larry Drew gave a rundown of the team's injuries in his pregame media session and then asked, ""Who'm I missing? Is that it?"" Thompson was a key member of the team that went to four straight NBA Finals and won the championship in 2016. Despite the injuries and early season drama that included coach Tyronn Lue being fired after an 0-6 start, he knows the players must keep their heads up. ""We've got to,"" he said. ""This is the NBA. We can't feel sorry for ourselves. It's a month into the season. We have to keep pushing and keep getting better."" Kemba Walker, the league's third-leading scorer, was held to a season-low seven points and was 2 for 16 from the field. The Hornets star guard was averaging 27.9 points going into the game. ""This was one of those nights,"" Walker said. ""I got to all my spots, was able to take all my shots. It was a rough night shooting the basketball."" Thompson matched his career high in rebounds and didn't play in the fourth quarter. Rodney Hood scored 16 points for Cleveland, which built a double-figure lead midway through the first quarter and maintained that the rest of the game. Rookie point guard Collin Sexton had 16 points and five assists. David Nwaba scored 18 points off the bench. Jeremy Lamb scored 22 points for Charlotte. The Hornets were 33 for 95 from the field and hit 8 of 41 of their 3-point attempts. Cleveland's past three losses were by a combined 12 points. The Cavaliers, who lost to the Hornets 126-94 on Nov. 3, led 63-42 late in the second quarter and were up 67-51 at the half, when Charlotte was 19 for 53 from the field. ""For the work we've been putting in and the tough times we've been through, tonight's win kind of pays off,"" Drew said. The Hornets cut the lead to 78-67 in the third quarter, but scored two points over the final five minutes of the period. J.R. Smith and Nwaba helped Cleveland maintain the momentum by hitting 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions. The Cavaliers built the lead to 25 points in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Hornets: Walker, an 87 percent shooter, missed two free throws in a trip to the line midway through the second quarter. ... F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (sprained right ankle) did not play after being injured Sunday at Detroit. He's averaging 8.6 points in 13 games off the bench. ... F Dwayne Bacon entered the rotation in his spot. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love had surgery Nov. 2 and is still wearing a walking boot on his left foot. .... Korver doesn't believe his injury is serious and said that he'd be surprised if he isn't ready play when the Cavaliers visit Detroit on Nov. 19. .... The 37-year-old Korver has been bothered by foot injuries the past two seasons. ... Drew said Osman likely will miss his third straight game Wednesday. MAKING PROGRESS Sexton, taken with the eighth pick in the draft, had four assists and five rebounds in 33 minutes. Drew said the 19-year-old will continue to play substantial minutes when Hill returns, but didn't indicate whether the rookie will continue to start. ""I see growth in the last week and a half,"" Drew said. ""He's starting to kind of figure it out."" RALLY KILLER Charlotte won three of four going into the game, but didn't play well in dropping to 7-7. ""Hopefully this gives us some fire,"" coach James Borrego said. ""There wasn't a whole lot of good out there. We're going to have to use this game as fuel for the next game.""","401070880"
"DENVER --  James Harden turned a slow start into a powerful finish. Harden scored 19 of his 22 points in the second half and the Houston Rockets pulled away to beat Denver 109-99 on Tuesday night, sending the Nuggets to a fourth straight loss. Harden also had 11 assists, with several going to Clint Capela, who led the Rockets with 24 points, including a series of dunks. ""I just take what the defense gives me,"" Harden said. ""I trusted the guys to make the right passes. Our bigs did a great job of finding those passing pockets. It requires patience, especially as a playmaker. ""It's going to take time, but we're getting there. If we keep guarding and defending at a high level our offense will come around. Once we put both together, it's going to get scary."" Chris Paul added 21 points for Houston, playing a third straight game without Carmelo Anthony because of what the team said was an illness. Houston, which had an NBA-high 65 wins last season, has won five of seven games since a 1-5 start. ""It's starting to roll a little bit better,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. Monte Morris had 19 points for the Nuggets, who have lost their last eight meetings with Houston. Gary Harris and Jamal Murray added 15 points apiece. A step-back shot by Murray got Denver within four points midway through the fourth quarter but Harden went on a tear, scoring 11 straight Houston points to put the Rockets up 104-91 with 3:48 remaining. Murray said trying to slow down Harden is tough, not only because of his skill level as a former league MVP but because of the because of the players surrounding him. ""They've got shooters all around,"" Murray said. ""They've got a great team. He's surrounded by players you have to guard as well, not just James Harden, so it gives him a lot of space to operate in and he did that tonight."" The Nuggets closed the gap to six points in the waning moments but the Rockets got a couple of free throws from Paul and a dunk from Capela to hold on. ""We got two really good wins (consecutively),"" Paul said. ""This was a good road win for us. They play well here at home. We'll take it. We're still just building."" Down by a point at the break, the Rockets opened up an 86-76 lead going into the final quarter. After a pair of free throws by Paul Millsap pulled Denver to 74-72, the Rockets closed the final 4 1/2 minutes of the third period on a 12-4 run capped by Eric Gordon's driving layup. Murray hit a jumper in the final seconds of the second quarter to give the Nuggets a 55-54 halftime lead.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Kevin Durant never found his typical offensive flow and found it a little strange playing without fiery Draymond Green, even if they have yet to make up from all that went down a night earlier in Los Angeles. Durant isn't sharing any details. ""I'm going to keep that in house, that's what we do here,"" Durant said. ""I'm not trying to give nobody no headlines. What happened, happened. We're trying to move on, we're just trying to play basketball."" Durant scored 29 points with a key jumper in the final minute, a day after a shouting episode on the bench with Green at least in part led to his teammate's suspension Tuesday, and the undermanned Golden State Warriors held off the Atlanta Hawks 110-103. Klay Thompson added 24 points as Splash Brother Stephen Curry missed his third straight game with a strained left groin. The two-time MVP shuffled and danced as he celebrated big plays from the bench. Taurean Prince scored 22 points, making four 3-pointers and finishing 8 for 14 from the floor in the Hawks' fifth straight loss and ninth in 10. Durant led the way despite shooting 9 of 23 hours after the Warriors suspended All-Star Green for one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team. He got into it with Durant on the bench at the end of regulation in a 121-116 overtime road loss to the Clippers and Green wasn't even at the arena Tuesday. Jonas Jerebko started in place of Green and had season bests of 14 points and 14 rebounds -- ""He was our MVP tonight,"" coach Steve Kerr said -- as the Warriors stayed unbeaten in the second game of a back-to-back this season. Quinn Cook dished out six of Golden State's 28 assists playing in Curry's spot. ""I think we're all professional. We all love each other. We're with each other every day for nine months. Brothers are going to fight and brothers are going to get into it,"" Cook said. ""I think the biggest thing, we know the common goal, we know what's at stake. These guys have been great for a while. I think we're all going to get past this and come together. It's going to make us stronger."" Does Durant agree? ""Who knows, we'll see,"" he said. Dazzling Atlanta rookie Trae Young was held to four points on 2-for-12 shooting and missed all five of his attempts from beyond the arc. The Hawks dropped their eighth straight to the Warriors and seventh in a row at Oracle Arena. Golden State shot 6 for 21 in the opening quarter, missing 7 of 9 3-point tries. ""Not an easy game back-to-back, just coming in a little fatigued, a little emotionally spent and we had to grind it out,"" Kerr said. ""I'm proud of the guys. It wasn't our best game but it was a good effort. We stayed solid."" TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta hasn't won on Golden State's home floor since a 95-79 victory on Feb. 25, 2011, and not in the series since Feb. 6, 2015. ... The Hawks are 1-7 on the road, 0-3 vs. the Western Conference. .. Prince has hit at least one 3 in his first 13 games. ""Just to see him in rhythm, in our offense with the ball and body movement that we like to play with, really helped everybody out,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Warriors: Durant made all 11 of his free throws and grabbed six rebounds. ... Jerebko posted his 11th career double-double. ... Golden State is 40-60 all-time without Curry, 23-19 since 2014-15. ... The Warriors are 3-0 in the second game playing consecutive nights. ... Golden State sold out for the 300th consecutive game, the fourth-longest active streak in the NBA. SMALL RING CEREMONY Behind the scenes, a few more Warriors championship rings were delivered. Former athletic trainer Chelsea Lane returned to Oracle with Atlanta and so did ex-Warriors performance coach and therapist Michael Irr and former assistant athletic trainer John Dusel. Lane, who was key to getting Curry back on the court for the playoffs, left the organization after the latest championship run to become Atlanta's executive director of athletic performance and sports medicine. Warriors general manager and assistant GM Kirk Lacob presented the rings outside Atlanta's locker room during pregame warmups. Lane joked about texting a photo of her ring to departed center Zaza Pachulia, who won't return to Oracle until late March with his new Pistons team to get his sparkling jewelry.","401070882"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Everything about Jimmy Butler's first game with the 76ers was going great, until the fourth quarter. Butler had 14 points in his Philadelphia debut, but the 76ers collapsed late and lost to Orlando 111-106 after Terrence Ross hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds left that helped the Magic finish off a big comeback Wednesday night. ""We're going to be just fine because once we put this together, we're going to be tough,"" said Butler, acquired Monday from Minnesota in a five-player swap. The four-time All-Star played 33 minutes and shot 6 for 12 from the field after a couple of days spent adjusting to the big trade. ""A lot has been going on, but that's no excuse for not winning,"" he said. ""No matter what, we're expected to win. I'm expecting to win, and we're expecting to win as a team. So that isn't an excuse."" Orlando scored 21 straight points in the fourth quarter, then held the 76ers without a field goal over the final 3 1/2 minutes. ""You don't just click your heels and win NBA games. We will use this as a way to remind everyone that this is the NBA,"" said 76ers coach Brett Brown. ""Although we lost, the organization of the things we put in put us in decent position. If we can get three shots (in the final minute) instead of three turnovers, maybe we're talking to each other about a win."" Nikola Vucevic had 30 points for the Magic, including two clinching free throws with 5.8 seconds remaining. ""They just made a big trade and we knew they were probably going to be very fired up to come in and play well,"" said Vucevic, who scored 11 in the fourth quarter. ""We stayed poised for 48 minutes. We got down 16 and we kept fighting. Getting stops was the big thing."" Joel Embiid finished with a triple-double of 19 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists for the 76ers, who lost for the seventh time in nine road games. J.J. Redick led Philadelphia with 22 points but committed two turnovers in the final 31 seconds. Vucevic had 19 points in the first half to help Orlando come back from a 10-point deficit and lead 53-52 at the break. Two baskets by Redick during a 10-2 run early in the third quarter put Philadelphia up 62-60. Embiid then made a play that turned the game sharply in the 76ers' favor for a while. After having the ball stolen from him by Magic forward Wes Iwundu, the 7-footer chased Iwundu down the court and blocked his layup attempt from behind. Philadelphia led 92-76 before the Magic scored 21 consecutive points. The 76ers made only seven of 18 shots in the fourth quarter. But the big number, according to Magic coach Steve Clifford, was free throws: 12 for Orlando, two for Philadelphia. ""It's been an area of weakness, and then tonight in the fourth quarter we didn't foul,"" Clifford said. ""Keeping the other team out of the bonus is a big deal, and in the fourth quarter it's even a bigger deal."" Wilson Chandler ended the 76ers' scoreless stretch of more than four minutes with a short baseline floater. Mike Muscala hit a 3-pointer for their final field goal with 3:33 remaining. BIG-TIME BLOCK After missing six games with a right ankle sprain, Jonathan Isaac played 16 quiet minutes except for one very loud play -- a rejection of Embiid's dunk attempt, high above the rim, right in the middle of the Magic's 21-0 spurt. ""That was pretty much the play of the game -- just the challenge alone,"" Orlando forward Aaron Gordon said. ""It takes a lot of courage to go up there and block somebody coming down the lane like that. Said Isaac: ""It felt fantastic."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid made all three of his 3-pointers in the first 4:09 of the game. ... Ben Simmons is 23 for 28 (.821) from the foul line at home, and 22 for 44 (.500) on the road. Magic: Ross has converted 12 of 18 shots from 3-point range in the last three games. ... Orlando broke a four-game losing streak against the 76ers and won for the fifth time in seven games overall.","401070883"
"WASHINGTON --  The Washington Wizards caught the undermanned Cleveland Cavaliers on the second game of back-to-backs Wednesday night. They seized the opportunity. Bradley Beal scored 20 points, Otto Porter added 15 and the Wizards beat the Cavaliers 119-95 for their third straight victory. Washington never trailed and led by as many as 27 points. ""We did a good job of coming out there very aggressive on the defensive end,"" Dwight Howard said. ""We got a lot of stops early which allowed us to get a pretty good lead."" The Wizards got 12 points from Austin Rivers and 11 from Markieff Morris. Rookie Collin Sexton had a career-high 24 points for Cleveland, and David Nwaba added 11 points. Playing the second straight night after topping Charlotte on Tuesday, the Cavaliers are an NBA-worst 2-12. In addition to forward Kevin Love (foot surgery), the Cavaliers were without starting point guard George Hill (hamstring), forward Sam Dekker (ankle) and forward Kyle Korver (sore right foot). ""On the second night of a back-to-back, you have to know they're going to throw their punches,"" Cavaliers forward Larry Nance, Jr. said.

They led 73-52 at halftime. Cleveland had a 13-2 run to get to 82-69 in the third, but Morris hit a 3-pointer and the Wizards scored seven straight points. Cleveland committed 24 turnovers that translated into 29 Wizards points. ""This building is a tough place to play, a tough place to win, especially if you turn the ball over,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""And bad shots are just as bad as a turnover.""

"Jaylen Brown breaks up a Bulls pass, Kyrie Irving taps it back to Brown on the fast break and he hammers it home with an easy two-handed dunk. (0:16) BOSTON --  The Celtics returned from a dreadful road trip with a resounding rout. Kyrie Irving had 17 points and seven assists and Jaylen Brown scored 18 as Boston beat the Chicago Bulls 111-82 on Wednesday night. ""One of the toughest things to do in this league is to come off a road trip, good or bad, and play well in front of the home fans,"" Irving said. ""For us it was a conscious effort to be more aggressive and kind of play the game out as it came."" The Celtics were back home for the first time since going 1-4 on a long trip that wrapped up with back-to-back losses in Utah and Portland. After a slow start through the first quarter, Boston started pulling away from the Bulls in the second quarter and never let up. ""Once we hit a couple shots, I thought we felt a lot better about ourselves,"" coach Brad Stevens said. Gordon Hayward scored 11 and Al Horford had 10 points and eight rebounds as all five Boston starters reached double figures. The Celtics capitalized on 22 turnovers by the Bulls, who dropped their second straight and third in four games. ""They came out and hit us in the mouth in the second quarter,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""A huge thing in this league is, find a way to fight through adversity and play through tough times, and we obviously did not do that well tonight."" Jabari Parker scored 14 in the first quarter for the Bulls, but was shut out the rest of the way. Shaquille Harrison led Chicago with 16 points. Zach LaVine had 10 points and nine assists, and Wendell Carter Jr. added 11 points and seven rebounds. ""We just weren't scoring the ball,"" LaVine said. ""We were playing really good defense, but the flood gates opened up and we couldn't respond."" The Celtics dominated the second quarter, holding Chicago to 11 points on five field goals, and continued to pull away in the second half. They held a 22-point lead entering the fourth quarter and emptied their bench. The reserves stretched the advantage to 33 before it was over. Terry Rozier had 12 points for Boston, and Aaron Baynes finished with nine points and 11 rebounds. After going 9 for 23 in the first quarter, the Celtics outscored Chicago 32-11 in the second and forced the Bulls into seven turnovers. Rozier's free throw after a technical foul on LaVine broke a 28-all tie and started Boston on a 12-0 run. The Celtics shut out the Bulls for 5:14 while pulling ahead 42-30, then closed the period on a 9-2 spurt for a 51-35 halftime lead. Baynes opened the fourth quarter for Boston with a 3-pointer and added a three-point play with 9:46 remaining to extend the margin to 87-64. Hayward followed with a jumper, then converted another three-point play as the Celtics opened a 92-64 bulge with 9:32 left. TIGHT D The Celtics made a season-high 12 steals, led by Hayward's three, and blocked five shots. Chicago's 82 points marked the lowest total allowed by Boston this season. ""We were prepared. I think that we've been prepared other games but we've got to match that with the attitude and effort to execute on both ends,"" Irving said. TIP-INS Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen (right elbow sprain) is still a few weeks out from playing for the first time this season, Hoiberg said. ""Lauri was able to increase his activity today and did not have any pain after, which is a great sign. Still same timeline -- a couple weeks away,"" Hoiberg explained. Celtics: F Marcus Morris sat out with an illness, missing his first game of the season. Morris came off the bench in the first 13 games and is fourth on the team in scoring at 11.8 points per game. ""We're better with Marcus. There's no question about that. We want him back ASAP,"" Stevens said.","401070885"
"NEW YORK --  The Miami Heat were eager to rediscover their defense after their poor recent performances. They did it rather easily against a team beginning life without its leading scorer. Tyler Johnson scored a season-high 24 points, Goran Dragic had 21 and the Heat beat the short-handed Brooklyn Nets 120-107 on Wednesday night to snap a three-game losing streak. Josh Richardson added 15 points and Hassan Whiteside had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat, who never trailed and led by as much as 23, setting the tone early with far better defensive focus than they showed lately. ""It has to be the way for this team,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It's hard hat, lunch pail every day and there's no other way."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 18 points for the Nets in their first game since losing Caris LeVert to a dislocated right foot. He could return this season from what appeared to be a severe injury when he was hurt Monday, but it could be a rough road without him for the Nets if Wednesday's game was any indication. ""I mean, obviously it's tough in the fashion that it happened,"" Nets forward Joe Harris said. ""Just the significance of how the injury happened, him being the heart and soul of the team up until this point, our go-to scorer and facilitator. Then obviously just the energy and enthusiasm and leadership that he brings, that's a void we miss a lot and it is going to be an adjustment for us."" Brooklyn was also without starting center Jarrett Allen again because of an illness. Miami had yielded 116.7 points in its last three games but Spoelstra said before the game the Heat weren't as far away defensively as they looked during the skid, noting they had the league's sixth-ranked defense after beating San Antonio before it started. Dragic said the Heat had a meeting to refocus and they were quickly locked in again, limiting the Nets to 6-for-24 shooting in the first quarter. Miami made 62.5 percent of its shots on the other end and led 37-21. The Nets shot 40 percent overall, but the Heat held them in the mid-30s through three quarters, when the game was decided. ""When you play tough, feels like you've got more confidence defensively and then when you don't put pressure on defense, the offense just flows,"" Dragic said. ""So we feel like everybody battled. We were the more aggressive team tonight."" Johnson shot 9 for 12 against the team that signed him to a $50 million offer sheet two summers ago, but the Heat held onto the guard by matching the deal. Miami led 90-72 lead after three. The Nets did finally cobble together enough offense to briefly get within single digits in the fourth. TIP-INS Heat: Longtime Heat forward Udonis Haslem got into a game for just the second time this season, playing two minutes and making his first field goal of the season. ... Richardson played in his 200th career game. Nets: Allen Crabbe, a starter last season who has struggled offensively coming off the bench thus far, was in the lineup in LeVert's spot but fouled out with just six points. ... Brooklyn had won the last three meetings and its only loss to Miami last season came in Mexico City. ROLLER-COASTER RIDE Nets coach Kenny Atkinson and general manager Sean Marks both talked about the range of emotions that started with seeing LeVert going down in Minnesota with his leg bent awkwardly and taken off to a stretcher, to getting the positive diagnosis of no fractures, no surgery necessary and a potential return this season the following day. Marks wouldn't put a timetable on a possible return, but the Nets were happy there was even hope of one so soon. ""I'm obviously definitely no doctor, but I think from the optics standpoint, when you see something like that, that's pretty gruesome, you're fearing the worst unfortunately,"" Marks said. ""And then you when you get the results, look, he's going to bounce back and that's terrific."" SEE YOU SOON The teams meet again next Tuesday in Miami, where the Nets were 2-0 last season.","401070886"
"TORONTO --  Dwane Casey's return to Toronto delivered drama right up until the final second. Reggie Bullock made the winning shot as time expired and the Detroit Pistons rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Raptors 106-104 on Wednesday night, giving Casey an emotional victory over his former team. ""I felt good for the players,"" Casey said. ""We were 19 down and didn't give up, didn't stop scrapping, didn't give in."" Blake Griffin had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Reggie Jackson and Langston Galloway each scored 13 and Stanley Johnson had 12 points for the Pistons, who had lost six of eight. ""He would never say it, but anytime you come back to a place you spent so much time at, had so much success and obviously the fans love him here, to win Coach of the Year and switch jobs in the same year is tough,"" Griffin said of Casey. ""I think it meant a lot to him. I was just proud of the way we came back and responded."" Casey raised his arms in triumph, pumped his fist, then ran onto the court to celebrate with his team after Bullock's tiebreaking basket in the lane. ""It was obviously good to be able to see a coach come from the other end of the court and celebrate with his players,"" Bullock said. Kawhi Leonard scored 26 points and Pascal Siakam and Greg Monroe each had 17 for the Raptors, who have lost consecutive home games after a 7-0 start. Toronto (12-3) also failed to match the best start in franchise history. The Raptors went 13-2 to begin the 2014-15 season. Raptors guard Kyle Lowry, who blossomed under Casey's leadership, was left fuming afterward about multiple Toronto miscues, including a blown coverage on the final play. ""It's a good win for him,"" Lowry said. ""I'm sure he's happy, but we're not happy. I'm not happy for him. We should have won the game."" Toronto had won six straight over the Pistons, and nine of the previous 11 meetings. Detroit trailed 88-77 to begin the fourth but took its first lead since the opening quarter, 98-97, on a jump shot by Jackson with 4:54 remaining. Leonard tied it at 104 by making a jumper with 38 seconds to go. Griffin missed a jumper at the other end and Lowry grabbed the rebound, giving Toronto 10 seconds to try a go-ahead shot. Leonard brought the ball up but lost it out of bounds with 2 seconds to go. After Siakam blocked Glenn Robinson's shot out of bounds, Detroit took the ball under the basket with 1.2 seconds left. Jose Calderon inbounded to a cutting Bullock, who won it with his buzzer-beater. ""I was pretty much butt-naked under the basket,"" Bullock said. ""I got the ball and just floated it."" Monroe played a season-high 21 minutes because starting center Serge Ibaka sat out with a sore right knee. Jonas Valanciunas started in his place. The Raptors lost another starter when guard Danny Green left with a sore lower back in the third quarter. He did not return. Toronto coach Nick Nurse expects Ibaka to return Friday at Boston, but said Green's status is unknown. Fans stood and cheered when Casey was introduced before the game, and roared in approval when a video tribute was shown during the first timeout. Players from both benches also stood and applauded as Casey acknowledged the crowd with a wave. ""He was drawing up a play,"" Griffin said. ""They had finished the video, everybody started clapping. I was watching the video, and the play. He was about to go over it again and I was like, `Coach, you've got to stand up. You deserve that."" Casey went 320-238 in seven seasons with the Raptors, more wins than any other coach in franchise history. He was selected NBA Coach of the Year after Toronto set a team record with 59 wins last season, but had been fired by the time he received the award. Casey was let go after the Raptors were swept in the second round of the playoffs by Cleveland, their third straight postseason defeat at the hands of the Cavaliers. TIP-INS Pistons: Calderon spent parts of eight seasons with the Raptors and is the franchise leader in assists (3,770). . This was the sixth time a Detroit game was decided by three or fewer points, tied with Chicago for most in the NBA. Raptors: F C.J. Miles, who left Monday's loss to New Orleans because of a strained right adductor, was inactive. There is no timetable for his return. ... For the second straight game, the Raptors missed nine of their first 10 attempts from 3-point range. They finished 4 for 20. CONFIDENCE IN COACH Griffin said he wasn't surprised at Casey's ability to draw up two late-game plays. Casey was not considered strong at in-game play-calling during his Toronto tenure. ""It isn't like we just discovered this for the first time today,"" Griffin said. ""Maybe to Toronto fans or certainly their GM, maybe it was a surprise, but not to us."" WEAK FINISH Toronto had eight turnovers in the fourth and scored 16 points, its fewest in any quarter this season.","401070887"
"MILWAUKEE --  In a game of runs between teams with contrasting styles, Memphis made the last, defining push. Marc Gasol scored 29 points, Mike Conley added 26 and the grind-it-out Grizzlies held off the up-tempo Bucks 116-113 on Wednesday night, handing Milwaukee its first home loss of the season. It's a nice way for Memphis to start a busy stretch of four games in six nights. ""The words `grit' and `grind' mean something to our guys,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""To do what we did here speaks to that."" After losing a 15-point lead in the third quarter, Memphis surged ahead again late and held on with key baskets from Conley. With the shot clock winding down, Conley hit a turnaround jumper in the middle of the lane for a 113-109 lead with 26 seconds left. Conley also hit two foul shots with 9.9 seconds left for a four-point lead, though Shelvin Mack went 1 of 2 at the line with 2.1 seconds left to give the Bucks one last chance trailing by three. The Bucks inbounded the ball to their best 3-point shooter, Khris Middleton. He missed near the top of the arc with two defenders in his face as time expired. ""Stops. Stops. Stops. Finding a way to stop them,"" Gasol said in describing Memphis' final run. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 31 points, and Middleton added 25 for the Bucks. They squandered an eight-point lead with 9:08 left. One of the NBA's most prolific 3-point shooting teams, Milwaukee couldn't overcome a cold-shooting night from the arc. They shot 50.6 percent overall but just 25.7 percent from 3-point territory (9 of 35). The Bucks came out sluggish coming off of a four-stop, Western Conference road trip, having also trailed by 11 in the first half. ""I felt like we could play with more energy, we could be better executing,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. IT'S PAT Mack added 15 points, including three 3s in a third quarter in which Memphis led by as much as 15. The Bucks got back in it with a 19-2 run spearheaded by defense and energetic guard Pat Connaughton, who had 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting and added six rebounds. Connaughton opened the fourth quarter with a dunk , and Eric Bledsoe followed with a steal and dunk on the break to tie the game at 84 apiece. It looked like the Bucks were off to the races again, playing their kind of pace. Memphis mustered enough defense late to hold off another charge. ""One thing we can do is defend when shots aren't falling,"" Connaughton said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: The win snapped a 16-game road losing streak against Eastern Conference foes. ... Down five players because of injuries, Memphis still enjoyed a pace in the first half that catered to its grind-it-out style. Gasol had 11 points to pace the Grizzlies' to a 48-45 halftime lead. It helped, too, that the Bucks were just 4 of 23 (17 percent) from the arc in the first half. Bickerstaff said the injuries haven't prevented the team from playing the kind of kind of slow-down, defensive style that he is trying to instill. ""The thought is can you make people uncomfortable and make them fight a fight they aren't accustomed to,"" Bickerstaff said. Bucks: Rookie G Donte DiVincenzo left the game with left knee soreness. He played six minutes in the first half, scoring three points. ... The Bucks wasted an opportunity to go 11-3, which would have matched their best start since 1980-81. ... Budenholzer was ejected in the fourth quarter after picking up his second technical foul. The ejection occurred after it appeared the Budenholzer was arguing about a call in which Malcolm Brogdon stepped out of bounds. The guard might have been pushed out of bounds by a defender. Asked if he was surprised that he got ejected, Budenholzer said ""It's a good question.""","401070888"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins are the main men in Minnesota again, and on Wednesday night they gave the Timberwolves exactly what they needed for a big win. Towns had 25 points and 16 rebounds, Wiggins scored 23 and Minnesota improved to 2-0 since trading Jimmy Butler with a 107-100 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Jeff Teague added 14 points and 14 assists for the Timberwolves, who shipped their disgruntled star to Philadelphia this week. The Wolves had acquired Butler in part to take some pressure off Towns and Wiggins, the talented but young faces of the franchise. Butler was a take-charge player, often dominating the ball in the fourth quarter, perhaps to the detriment of the growth of Towns and Wiggins. Now that Butler is gone after one-plus season, the Timberwolves have to find a new way to play. For two nights, at least, they seem to have figured out a formula for success. ""We were just playing together,"" Towns said. ""We did a great job getting the ball around, getting everyone involved. It was just about having fun and playing with love and enthusiasm."" Wiggins, who helped put the game away with an electrifying dunk in the final two minutes, acknowledged Butler's contributions, but also seemed to accept the higher expectations as the Wolves move forward without him. ""Whoever's on the floor has to step it up,"" Wiggins said. ""When Jimmy was here, Jimmy was a good player -- that's proven. Now it's up to us to close out games."" E'Twaun Moore scored a season-high 31 and Anthony Davis had 29 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans, who fell behind by 21 early in the second quarter. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said he warned his team to be ready to face an opponent that was especially hungry. ""You've got prideful guys on (the Timberwolves), and they want to show the world that they're pretty good in their own right,"" Gentry said. ""I thought they were going to come out and play with that intensity level, and they did, and we did not match that."" The Pelicans chipped away, cutting their deficit to 13 at halftime and just four going into the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves scored the first seven points of the period to stretch their lead to 92-81, but New Orleans responded with a 15-2 run to take its first lead of the game on a 12-foot jumper by Jrue Holiday. Wiggins' 3-pointer put the Wolves back on top and Towns followed with a three-point play to give Minnesota some breathing room. Then with 2 minutes to go, Towns made the play of the game. Playing with five fouls, he blocked Davis' layup attempt and fed Wiggins on the other end for a thunderous dunk. Wiggins was fouled as well, and his free throw put Minnesota up 105-98. ""You can't worry about five fouls with the game in the balance,"" Towns said. ""You've got to find a way to not foul, have good fundamentals, but also find a way to make stops and make plays."" It was exactly what Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau had in mind as he envisioned his two former No. 1 picks leading the Wolves into the future. ""Those are tough plays. Those are winning plays,"" Thibodeau said. ""I want them to continue to grow. There's a challenge for them to continue to get better. We talked about, one game doesn't mean you have it all figured out. Just come in tomorrow, be hungry to improve, and then be ready to play."" WELCOME TO TOWN The game was Minnesota's first with forwards Robert Covington and Dario Saric, who came over from Philadelphia with injured guard Jerryd Bayless in the Butler trade. The deal was completed Monday, meaning Covington and Saric did not join their new teammates in time for the Timberwolves' 120-113 victory over Brooklyn that night. Covington started Wednesday, scoring 13 points and grabbing seven rebounds. He drained a pair of long, catch-and-shoot 3s in the third quarter as the Timberwolves were trying to hold off the Pelicans' comeback. He also chipped in two steals and a blocked shot. ""Rob is amazing on defense -- he's everywhere,"" said Wiggins, who praised both his new teammates. ""They fit in perfectly."" Saric came off the bench to contribute nine points and three boards in 20 minutes. ""The last few days feel very short to me, but at the end of the day, this is basketball,"" Saric said. ""It was very pleasurable to be on the court. We played team basketball. I think we had 29 assists -- that's a pretty good number. It's just the beginning. I hope we still continue to play like this every game."" TIP-INS Pelicans: C Nikola Mirotic returned after missing two games with a right ankle sprain. He had 16 points and 10 boards. ... Gentry said point guard Elfrid Payton is close to returning from his own right ankle sprain, but he sat out his ninth straight game. Timberwolves: The win was Minnesota's fifth straight against New Orleans. ... G Derrick Rose (left knee soreness) did not dress after playing 39 minutes Monday in the win over Brooklyn. Rose is averaging 19.2 points and 4.8 assists per game this season. ... Teague played for the second time in three days after missing six games with a bruised left knee.","401070889"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George is feeling well -- and found his shooting touch. The All-Star forward scored a season-high 35 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder rout the New York Knicks 128-103 on Wednesday night. George made 13 of 22 shots, including 5 of 11 3-pointers. He was coming off a 32-point performance on Monday night against Phoenix during which he made 11 of 19 shots and 6 of 10 threes. ""My body has just been feeling good,"" he said. ""I've kind of played myself into good shape from a body standpoint. If I can just find open looks like that, I feel comfortable taking them."" Knicks coach David Fizdale has seen this from George before. Fizdale was an assistant coach for Miami when George was with the Indiana Pacers, one of the top roadblocks to the Heat's championship runs. ""There was just times where we were under his shirt and he was just letting that thing go from deep,"" Fizdale said. ""We tried to trap him some. ... I felt that pain from him when I've had my best teams. This guy's a big-time player. When he gets it going like that, he's tough."" Steven Adams had 19 points and seven rebounds, and Dennis Schroder added 15 points and 12 assists for the Thunder. They have won nine of 10 since an 0-4 start, and improved to 4-1 since point guard Russell Westbrook was sidelined with a sprained left ankle. The Thunder matched their second-best scoring output of the season and posted their largest victory margin. Tim Hardaway, Jr. scored 20 points, and Enes Kanter added 19 for the Knicks. George scored 18 points in the first half and Adams added 15 to help the Thunder take a 65-49 lead. Oklahoma City shot 56.5 percent from the field before the break. The Thunder put the game out of reach in the third quarter. Adams threaded the needle to find a cutting Patrick Patterson for a dunk, then Patterson lobbed to George for a jam that put Oklahoma City ahead 85-61. George scored 17 points in the third quarter, and the Thunder led 100-80 at the end of the period. Fizdale said it was a learning experience for his young squad. ""We have a microcosm of how I'd like our guys to play,"" Fizdale said. ""Fast, athletic, disruptive."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kanter, who played for the Thunder for two seasons and part of another, got a warm reception from the fans when he checked in as a reserve. ...

Adams matched a career high with five assists. ... F Jerami Grant scored 15 points. ... Rookie reserve Hamidou Diallo scored 11 points. ADAMS TALKS TRASH Adams and Kanter were best friends in Oklahoma City. They talked trash throughout the game, with Adams even suggesting Fizdale should take Kanter out. Adams said he said it because he respects Kanter. ""Yeah, I was trying to discourage him because he's a bloody good player,"" Adams said. ""It's best to have him off the floor for us."" THUNDER DEFENSE Since Westbrook's injury, the Thunder have held opponents to 96.2 points per game. For perspective, every team in the league entered Wednesday's action averaging at least 101.2 points per game.

"DALLAS --  Dallas and Utah made history. The Jazz weren't pleased with their share. Harrison Barnes scored 19 points in 26 minutes and the Mavericks handed the Jazz their worst loss since moving to Utah, 118-68 on Wednesday night. While in New Orleans, the Jazz lost to Milwaukee by 56, 158-102 on March 14, 1979. ""There was a point where we stopped competing,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We all have to own that and obviously the scoreboard reflected that. Dallas set a franchise mark for the fewest points allowed in a half at 22, giving up 13 in the third quarter and nine in the fourth. The previous record was 23 against Sacramento on Jan. 14, 2012. The 50-point margin of victory was the second-highest in team history behind a 53-point win over Philadelphia. Utah was a point off its lowest-scoring half, set against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 4, 2000. The Mavericks shot 58 percent, making 43 percent of their 3-point shots. ""It was great, and I will just say that I can't remember a better defensive performance by a Mavericks team in 11 years,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I am just really impressed with the way the guys brought it against a ridiculously difficult team to play."" The 50-point margin of victory for Dallas tied for the second-highest in team history behind a 53-point win over Philadelphia Nov. 13, 2014. Barnes was 6 for 11 from the field, 3 for 5 on 3-pointers and 4 for 4 on free throws. ""I just feel good in general,"" Barnes said. ""I'm starting to find my rhythm."" He seemed more impressed with Dallas' season-best third straight win than the margin of victory. ""We haven't too many victories here in Dallas,"" Barnes said. J.J. Barea added 14 points, Luka Doncic and Dwight Powell had 13 each and Dorian Finney-Smith finished with 11. The Mavericks' backups accounted for 66 points, only two fewer than the Utah team. Ricky Rubio led Utah with 11 points, Rudy Gobert had 10 points and 10 rebounds, and Donovan Mitchell also scored 10 points. I think it's just that they outplayed us in every lineup,"" Gobert said. ""Every guy that was on the court got outplayed."" Tempers flared at times. Utah's Derrick Favors was charged with a Flagrant 1 foul, and three Mavericks receiving technical fouls. Dallas extended its winning streak to a season-best three games. The Jazz had won three in a row and won the first two games between the teams this season. TIP-INS Jazz:  Their 13 points in the third quarter were a short-lived season low, not even reaching the 15 they scored in the fourth quarter at Denver on Nov. 3. ... Utah has played Dallas three times in the last nine games. The teams will meet only once more this season, at Utah on Feb. 23. Mavericks: Wesley Matthews (strained left hamstring) came back after missing Monday's game at Chicago but left Wednesday's game early in the third quarter with a similar injury. ... Before Wednesday, Dallas' low yield for a quarter had been 18 points by the Jazz in the fourth quarter on Nov. 7.","401070891"
"PHOENIX --  Nights when star Devin Booker is off his game don't often spell victories for the struggling Phoenix Suns. But Booker was still a factor Wednesday night, and his teammates picked him up. T.J. Warren scored 16 of his 27 points in the first half and the Suns built a big lead, almost lost it and then pulled away for a 116-96 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. The Suns ended a four-game losing streak to improve to 3-11. ""Fifty-point swing since we played them the last time,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said, referring to the Spurs' 120-90 win Oct. 31. ""We have to be pleased with just that fact."" Deandre Ayton added 17 points and 10 rebounds, including a powerful dunk over Davis Bertans early in the fourth quarter. Isaiah Canaan had 19 points and made all five of his 3-pointers, Booker had 13 points and a career high 12 assists -- though he committed seven turnovers -- and the Suns shot a season-high 56 percent. ""I just had to keep making plays for other people,"" Booker said. ""A lot of laughter and smiles after the game, and that's the feeling we want around here."" DeMar DeRozan had 24 points for the Spurs, and Derrick White added 16. They have lost four of five. ""We have been terrible defensively,"" DeRozan said. ""We didn't make nothing too uncomfortable for them. They kept their rhythm and pulled away again. We can't let that happen and it all starts on defense."" Warren's short jumper with 6:42 to play gave the Suns a 105-85 lead, and Phoenix was able to close it out comfortably. The Spurs trailed by one early in the third quarter, but the Suns extended their lead. Warren hit a baseline 3 for a 79-66 lead, and Jamal Crawford knocked one down from the other side of the court with 58 seconds to go, giving the Suns an 82-68 lead. Crawford sank a high-arc 3 with 7.9 seconds left, and the Suns went into the final quarter ahead 87-70. Crawford scored 10 of his 11 points in the third. San Antonio's high-scoring LaMarcus Aldridge made just 3 of 12 shots for six points against frequent double-team defense, though he added 12 rebounds. ""We're hearing `De-fense!' Love that though. Fans have been waiting for something like that for a while,"" Ayton said. The Suns went ahead by as many as 19 points before the first quarter ended. Warren had 12 points in the period. Canaan's jumper at the quarter buzzer gave Phoenix a 34-19 lead. The Spurs rallied in the second quarter but got a scare when DeRozan was fouled hard on a drive and crashed to the floor. He stayed down momentarily but got to his feet, shot free throws and continued to play. San Antonio cut the Suns' lead to 43-37 on Patty Mills' steal and layup with 4:16 left in the first half. Bryn Forbes' 3 made it a two-point game before the half, and the Suns' lead was 52-48 at the intermission. Forbes made 3 of 4 3s in the first half and scored 13 points. TIP-INS Spurs: F Rudy Gay was rested and did not play. ... C Pau Gasol missed the game with left foot soreness. He's been out four games. ... With DeRozan's 10th made free throw of the game, he passed Crawford for 95th-most in NBA history. Suns: F Josh Jackson saw extended minutes with Trevor Ariza unavailable, and had an impact with his 14 points and a second-quarter blocked shot his teammates celebrated from the bench. Jackson also threw a lob to Ayton for a dunk just before halftime. ... Rookie De'Anthony Melton played in just his third game of the season. FIRST START Suns rookie Mikal Bridges made his first career start Thursday, in at forward for Ariza, who was not with the team due to personal reasons. ""Just bringing in a young guy, young energy, young voice and he is our voice,"" Kokoskov said of Bridges. QUICK POP ON BOOKER Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was asked about Booker before the game, and called him a ""wonderful player."" ""He's somebody who has worked so hard and his skills are so evident that his confidence should be there and he should never doubt anything about what he can accomplish,"" Popovich said.","401070892"
"LOS ANGELES --  A floating jumper, a foul and a free throw in the fourth quarter of a tight game. With a gorgeous three-point play , the King jumped over the Big Dipper. LeBron James' inimitable presence has already been felt in his first few weeks in Hollywood. His most impressive game yet for the Lakers included a bit of history when he passed Wilt Chamberlain on the NBA's career scoring list. The superstar with no shortage of historic achievements was more excited about leading his surging new team to yet another win. James had a season-high 44 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, roaring past Chamberlain for fifth place on the scoring chart and leading the Lakers to a 126-117 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. James scored 28 points in the second half and vaulted past Chamberlain's 31,419 points on that three-point play with 3:55 to go. LeBron finished a memorable night with 31,425 points, and fell just short of his 75th triple-double during his most impressive performance since joining the Lakers. Afterward, James praised Chamberlain as ""One of the most dominant forces we ever had in our game, along with Shaq. One of the greatest Lakers to ever play the game. A 100-point scorer. One of the greatest scorer-rebounders to ever play this game."" James already has moved from seventh to fifth on the career scoring list during his first 14 games with Los Angeles, passing Dirk Nowitzki and Chamberlain. Five of the top six scorers in NBA history have suited up for the Lakers -- including Chamberlain, whose No. 13 hangs high above the Staples Center court. James hit his first five 3-pointers and finished 13 of 19 from the field, reaching his latest milestone during a dominant performance that had chants of ""M-V-P!"" raining down from the Staples Center crowd. But the kid from Akron will never let it get to his head. In fact, he will donate his jersey and the game ball to his I Promise School back in Ohio. ""Anytime my name is mentioned with some of the greats to play this game, I always think back to my hometown, where I come from, how far I've come,"" James said. Before the Lakers embark on a three-game trip that includes his return to Cleveland on Nov. 21, James showed his new home fans what they can expect in big moments -- as if any basketball fan with a pulse didn't already know. He scored 16 points in the third quarter and 12 in the fourth, never allowing Portland to make a final run during the Lakers' fourth consecutive win. ""We did a lot of nice things, but we did a lot of sloppy things tonight,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""A lot of soft defense."" There was bad news on a triumphant night, too: After the game, Walton revealed that Rajon Rondo broke his right hand, apparently while making a steal in the fourth quarter. The veteran point guard will be sidelined for at least a few weeks, and starter Lonzo Ball's so-far moderate workload is likely to increase. ""It's tough,"" James said. ""He's one of our captains, one of our leaders. I know he'll get right to it with his rehab, but it's next man up."" Damian Lillard had 31 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds, and CJ McCollum scored 23 in the Trail Blazers' first road loss to the Lakers since Feb. 22, 2013, ending a nine-game streak at Staples. Portland has lost two straight to the Lakers after winning 16 in a row. ""LeBron, it was a dominant performance,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""(Scoring) 44 points on 19 shots, that doesn't happen too often. When he's hitting his 3s and putting his head down, he's tough to stop."" JaVale McGee scored 20 points and Brandon Ingram added 17 in the Lakers' sixth win in seven games. After a slow start, Los Angeles (8-6) is already finding its groove in its first season with James and his fellow veterans joining a young core. Los Angeles is off to its best start since the 2011-12 season. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard played without restrictions after missing practice to rest his right knee. ... Portland's four-game winning streak ended, but the Blazers are still on top of the Northwest Division. ... Jusuf Nurkic had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and Al-Farouq Aminu scored 18 points. Lakers: The 6-foot-5 Josh Hart blocked a dunk attempt by the 7-foot Nurkic in the first quarter. ... Michael Beasley didn't play, but the veteran was back in uniform after missing several recent games for undisclosed personal reasons. He hasn't played since Oct. 25. HEAVY HITS The Blazers delivered two hard fouls against James in the fourth quarter, both requiring him to spend an extra moment recovering. McCollum floored James with a foul that was upgraded to a flagrant foul with 4:38 left, and then Nurkic appeared to use his two fists to make a crybaby gesture when talking to officials about it. ""LeBron carried them,"" Nurkic said. ""When he's making shots, outside shots, he's tough to handle."" FAMILIAR FOES The teams were meeting for the third time in four weeks already this season, a schedule quirk that didn't particularly please either coach. The Blazers spoiled LeBron's debut with the Lakers in a 128-119 win at Portland last month, but the Lakers replied by ending their 16-game skid in the rivalry by beating the Blazers 114-110 just 16 days later in the Moda Center. The clubs don't have their final meeting until the regular-season finale at Staples Center on April 9.","401070893"
"After the Warriors' loss to the Rockets, Kevin Durant quickly shuts down a reporter who asks about his relationship with Draymond Green. (0:58) HOUSTON --  For a team with championship hopes, it seems a bit silly for the Houston Rockets to be happy about being .500. But after the way they started the season, the Rockets took a moment to appreciate their recent progress after a rout of Golden State on Thursday night improved them to 7-7. James Harden scored 27 points in Houston's 107-86 victory in a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals. The Rockets, who announced before the game that they were ""parting ways"" with 10-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony, have won three straight and six of their last eight games after starting 1-5 to reach .500 for the first time since they were 1-1. ""I just told them: `Congratulations, guys. We're .500. That's really good,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said with a laugh. Then he got serious. ""This is a good step ... it's early but we do have the potential to be really good in different areas of the game and we've just got to keep building on it."" The Warriors, who got Draymond Green back from his suspension but were without Stephen Curry for the fourth straight game, have lost two of their last three. Curry has already been ruled out for Golden State's next two games because of a groin injury. ""We're banged up a little bit physically and right now we're banged up spiritually,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""There's no getting around that. So we've got to fill up our cup and get our spirit back, get our energy back and we're going to. It's a long season and this is a tough stretch we're dealing with."" Houston had a 13-point lead after three and opened the fourth quarter with a 12-2 run to make it 88-65 and spur Kerr to call a timeout. The Rockets then scored the first nine points after the timeout, with six from James Ennis, to make it 97-65 midway through the quarter and put the game out of reach. Both teams cleared their benches a couple of minutes after that. Harden likes the attitude the Rockets have shown in clawing back after their terrible start. ""Our spirit and just the way we're getting after it,"" Harden said. ""We're taking an individual challenge and the team challenge of guarding and offensively we're just sharing the basketball and obviously we're knocking down shots."" Kevin Durant had 20 points for the Warriors on a night they were just 4 of 18 on 3-pointers. Green had five rebounds and five assists in his return from the one-game ban imposed by the team for a dustup with Durant in Monday night's overtime loss to the Clippers. Green addressed the situation for the first time after shootaround but did not apologize for his actions in the heated exchange. He said he and Durant had spoken and that they were ""moving forward."" ""I think there's no secret that I am an emotional player,"" he said. ""I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I play with that same emotion. Sometimes they get the best of me. And (if) it doesn't work to my favor I'm going to live with that."" Durant was in no mood to discuss their relationship after the game, saying: ""Don't ask me about that again,"" before turning away from the reporter who posed the question. While the Warriors dealt with the drama between Green and Durant, the Rockets were left to answer questions about the decision to move on from Anthony. Anthony played just 10 games after signing a one-year, $2.4 million deal during the offseason. ""In the summer we tried to hit a home run and it didn't work out,"" D'Antoni said. ""He tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn't work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn't work out."" The Rockets opened the third quarter with a 7-2 run to stretch the lead to 54-43. Harden scored five straight points to make it 63-47 on his 3-pointer with about 5 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. Golden State got going after that, using an 8-2 spurt to get within 65-55 a couple of minutes later. Gary Clark ended the run with a 3-pointer, and two more 3s by him within a minute of each other late in the third extended the lead to 76-59. It was 76-63 headed to the fourth. TIP-INS Warriors: Curry was with the Warriors on the trip but it's unclear when he'll return. ""We're going to be very, very careful, and obviously he's going to need plenty of court time before he returns,"" Kerr said. ""When I say court time, I mean live action. He hasn't had that.""... Kevon Looney scored a season-high 12 points. Rockets: Gerald Green returned after missing the last two games with a sprained ankle. ... Ennis finished with 19 points and Eric Gordon had 17 off the bench. ... Houston made 16 of 47 3-pointers. THEY SAID IT Houston's Chris Paul on the end of Anthony's time with the Rockets: ""For Melo it's all about just him being happy. So wherever that is or whatever's next he's going to figure it out.""","401070894"
"Mason Plumlee smashes down a two-handed monster jam off the lob from Monte Morris. (0:15) DENVER --  Criticized by their coach for slow, stagnant play, the Denver Nuggets reverted to a fast-break style that carried their offense to new highs. Juancho Hernangomez scored a season-high 25 points to lead seven Nuggets in double figures and Denver set the tone for a runaway victory with a big first quarter Thursday night, beating the Atlanta Hawks 138-93. ""We just played with freedom,"" Hernangomez said. ""Everybody played hard, everybody played really good defense and after our defense, it was easy to run. It's who we are. Last season we played like this. Everybody ran, everybody cut, everybody shot. I think we're in a great mode."" Paul Millsap and Gary Harris added 18 points apiece for the Nuggets, who unleashed a torrid offensive display to snap their season-high, four-game losing streak. ""It started right from the get-go,"" said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who took his team to task the day before for playing what he described as predictable basketball. ""This has been coming ... 35 assists, to shoot the ball as well as we did throughout the game, our starters, the guys off the bench, it was great to see."" Jamal Murray, who came off the bench rather than start, had 14 points, as did Trey Lyles. Denver outshot Atlanta 56.4 percent to 34.8 percent from the field and pushed the pace throughout, getting up and down the floor and wearing down the Hawks, who like to run themselves but were also playing at altitude and in the midst of a four-game road trip. ""It wasn't the altitude, it was the lack of effort,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""This one stung. Everyone has a game like tonight. It's frustrating when you have to speak to effort and this wasn't any fun. Tonight we didn't have it for some reason. We'll regroup and stay together tomorrow on our day off."" Jeremy Lin scored 16 points and Kent Bazemore had 14 in the Hawks' sixth straight loss. The Nuggets outscored Atlanta 13-0 to start the game en route to a 35-23 advantage after one quarter, when Atlanta missed 13 of its first 21 shots. ""We've got to stop putting ourselves in that situation,"" the Hawks' Omari Spellman said. ""It's not acceptable that we keep coming out like that. We can't wait till we get punched in the mouth to compete."" Denver stretched its lead to 73-57 lead at the half. It was the most points scored in the first two quarters this season by the Nuggets, who forced the Hawks into 10 turnovers in that span, eight by steals. Millsap, who spent four seasons with the Hawks before coming to Denver as a free agent two years ago, was at the center of the defensive effort, getting all four of his steals in the first half. The Nuggets surpassed the century mark on a three-point play by Millsap for a 101-68 lead with 3:11 left in the third quarter. By the start of the fourth quarter, the Nuggets were up by 36 points and substituting freely. TIP-INS Hawks: F Taurean Prince was held out of the game because of Achilles tendon soreness. ""After shootaround, he just didn't feel comfortable testing it out tonight, so a night of rest,"" Pierce said. Nuggets: The previous high for points in the first half was 68 against the Sacramento Kings on Oct. 23. ... The total by Denver was nine points off its season high for a game, 147 against the Los Angeles Clippers on Oct. 17. RESERVE FOR THE NIGHT Malone said Murray began the game on the bench because ""he had a small violation of team rules. We went with Monte (Morris) and Jamal will be back in the lineup against New Orleans.""","401070895"
"LOS ANGELES --  Lou Williams did it again. He hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the San Antonio Spurs 116-111 on Thursday night for their first three-game winning streak of the season. ""We feel like we're a good basketball team despite what people are talking about,"" Williams said. The Clippers improved to 7-1 at home after blowing leads of 14 points in the second quarter and 10 in the fourth. ""This was a gritty win,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. The Spurs were the third high-powered team in a row beaten by the Clippers, who edged Milwaukee and defending NBA champion Golden State in a pair of overtime wins. Williams proved the difference in those games, too. He scored the final 10 points in overtime against the Warriors after the Clippers blew a 14-point lead in the fourth. His layup with 0.3 seconds left in overtime beat the Bucks. ""It's a good experience for us, especially early in the season,"" Williams said. ""It'll be worth our while late in the season."" Williams led Los Angeles with 23 points off the bench, hitting two free throws to seal the win. ""When he goes out there and does the things that he does, how effortless he does it, he only weighs 90 pounds soaking wet,"" DeRozan said. ""It's amazing to see."" Danilo Gallinari added 19 points, including four straight late free throws, and Tobias Harris 18. DeRozan scored 34 points for the Spurs, who dropped their third in a row. Rudy Gay added 19 points off the bench. The Spurs tied it up 107-all on a pair of free throws by LaMarcus Aldridge, who had 16 rebounds. Williams tried to get Bryn Forbes in the air with a pump-fake and let fly a 3, having missed his two other attempts in the game. ""We fight all the way back and then at the end it unravels, so that's pretty frustrating,"" Forbes said. ""The last two games we actually tied it with a few minutes to go and just completely blew it."" DeRozan scored on a drive to get the Spurs to 110-109, but they got no closer. ""It sucks to lose these games but it's still early in the season,"" DeRozan said. ""We'd rather go through it now than later. Everybody in the league is right there. Once we catch our stride, we'll be fine."" Montrezl Harrell scored the Clippers' first six points of the fourth to get them back to a double-digit lead, 96-86. DeRozan missed two free throws before Patty Mills and Marco Belinelli hit back-to-back 3-pointers that closed the Spurs to 96-94. San Antonio got within one early in the third on basket by DeRozan. He twice scored to put them within two. But every time the Clippers answered to stay ahead, with their second unit scoring 10 of their final 12 points for a 91-84 lead after three. The Clippers opened the second quarter with a 15-2 run that produced their largest lead of 44-30. Harrell scored seven in a row. The Spurs answered with a 23-8 spurt, including 10 by DeRozan, to erase their 14-point deficit and give them a 53-52 lead. The Clippers got a pair of free throws by Gallinari to lead 61-60 going into halftime. TIP-INS Spurs: They fell to 2-5 on the road. ... They were outrebounded 50-45. ... F-C Pau Gasol missed his fifth straight game with a sore left foot. Clippers: Harris has at least 15 points in a career-best 14 straight games. ... They improved to 5-1 in their last six games at home against the Spurs. THE ROOKIE Shai Gilgeous-Alexander got in foul trouble for the first time this season with three in the first half. Rivers kept him on the floor after he got his fourth and the rookie didn't get another. Gilgeous-Alexander finished with nine points and five rebounds. He came up with a big jumper when the Clippers were clinging to a one-point lead in the fourth. ""He's a tough kid. You look at his body and the last thing you think of is tough,"" Rivers said. ""He's a skinny kid who's tough."" HE SAID IT ""I believe I am one of the underrated players in the league."" -- Harris after hearing TNT commentator Charles Barkley described him that way.","401070896"
"Kyrie Irving drops 43 points and 11 assists, leading the Celtics to a 123-116 overtime victory against the Raptors. (1:24) BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving had 11 straight Boston points down the stretch and scored 17 in all in the last 8:06 of the fourth quarter. Then in overtime, he really turned it on. The Celtics guard made or assisted on every basket in the extra period, finishing with 11 assists and a season-high 43 points on Friday night to lead Boston to a 123-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors. ""Man, he made some shots tonight where you're just like, `Wow,"" forward Gordon Hayward said. ""You catch yourself being a fan. When he gets into that mode, the whole arena knew where we were going, and so did the Raptors. They just couldn't stop him."" It was the first time Irving has scored at least 40 points with 10 or more assists in a game. He was the first player do it in the NBA this year, and the first Celtics player since Antoine Walker in 2001. ""Kyrie did a great job in the fourth quarter knocking down shots,"" said Kawhi Leonard, who scored 31 points and had a season-high 15 rebounds for Toronto. ""We fought hard tonight, they played a better game and we've just got to keep playing better."" Jayson Tatum had 21 points and seven rebounds for the Celtics, who evened the season series at one game apiece against the only team to finish above them in the Eastern Conference last season. The home team has won nine straight matchups. Serge Ibaka scored 21 and Pascal Siakam had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors, who have lost three straight since opening the season with 12 victories in their first 13 games. Toronto never led in overtime. ""It was just a veteran game out there, just great competition for a Friday night in the NBA,"" Irving said. ""You've got to appreciate that, two great teams going at it. And I'm pretty sure we'll see them down the road."" HEY, HEY! Hayward scored 15 points and had five rebounds and five assists in a team-high 39 minutes -- by far his biggest workload since the injury that knocked him out in the first quarter of the first game last season. ""I was wondering if they were going to take me out of the game,"" he said. ""Happy that he left me in. It felt good to play that many minutes. It's been such a long time. It was a good confidence-builder."" Hayward hit a pair of free throws to open the overtime, Ibaka answered with a jumper and from there it was all Celtics. Hayward scored on a pass from Irving, then Irving rescued Tatum from a near-turnover and drove for the layup to give Boston a 113-109 lead. The Raptors never got closer than three points after that. ""Not too often during the regular season we get to have games like this,"" Irving said. ""A great test for your team on both ends of the basketball floor, a great player in that other locker room, the competition and the level of play raises and you've just got to appreciate that."" END OF REGULATION Toronto led by eight early in the fourth quarter and still had a 107-103 lead with 90 seconds left. But Tatum dunked to cut the deficit to two points and Siakam was called for pushing while going for a rebound, sending Hayward to the line for the game-tying free throws. Leonard had a chance to win it at the end of regulation, but his long jumper went off the rim. ""The main thing is we're going to hold it until the very last shot so that nothing bad happens and they can't get a rebound and call a timeout,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""It's just man on man and you hope your guy can make the basket and we have a lot of faith in him that he can."" DUCK Late in the third quarter, Kyle Lowry got Tatum in the air with a fake and then tried to duck under him as the Celtics forward came over the top. But Tatum wound up kicking him in the head as he came back down. Lowry went to the floor but remained in the game and made both free throws to give Toronto a 78-68 lead their first double-digit advantage of the game. TIP-INS Irving surpassed the 10,000 point and the 2,500 assist milestones. ... After going 1-4 on a road trip, the Celtics have won two in a row at home. ... Toronto's OG Anunoby left the game in the third quarter with a sprained right wrist. ... The Raptors already beat Boston 113-101 on Oct. 19.

Josh Richardson scored 28 points, including 7 of 10 from beyond the arc, and Hassan Whiteside had 12 points and 17 rebounds for the Heat, losers in four of their last five games. The Pacers used a 16-0 run in the second quarter to take the lead for good. Indiana did just enough in the second half to fend off its Eastern Conference rivals. Sabonis converted a three-point play with 7:24 left in the second quarter to give the Pacers a 34-32 lead, and they led the rest of the way. The win comes a week after the Pacers rallied to beat the Heat 110-102 in Miami, closing out the victory with a 16-2 run that included the final 12 points. Miami was unable to return the favor in the second of three regular-season meetings between the teams.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Jimmy Butler had the sellout crowd chanting his name and singing his favorite theme song. Butler scored 28 points in his home debut, Joel Embiid had 23 and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Utah Jazz 113-107 on Friday night. Butler, the four-time All-Star acquired Monday from Minnesota in a five-player trade, got a loud ovation during introductions and quickly made an impression as the Sixers built a 16-point lead in the first quarter. Fans serenaded him throughout the game and he got to hear the team's ""1-2-3 Sixers"" theme song after the win. ""I already knew this crowd would be excited,"" Butler said. ""Now that I have them on my side it's better for me. Y'all, we, have some great fans. Y'all have the catchiest song. I used to sing it in my head when I came in here."" The Jazz rallied after a rough first quarter and the teams went back-and-forth in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder's put-back after Ricky Rubio's stole the ball and missed a lay-up gave Utah a 107-105 lead with 1:37 left. JJ Redick tied it on a pair of free throws. Ben Simmons' driving lay-up gave the 76ers a 109-107 lead. Butler then hit a jumper to extend the lead and drew an offensive foul, sending the crowd into a frenzy as Hall of Famer Allen Iverson jumped up to celebrate from his courtside seat. ""The atmosphere was amazing,"" Embiid said. The 76ers are 29-1 in last 30 regular-season home games. Redick had 16 points and Simmons had 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Embiid scored 12 of his points in the fourth quarter after he played less than a minute in the third because he had four fouls. Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 31 points. ""We competed but we have to be smarter,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We had some mistakes where we have to think more. They add up against a team like this."" After the Jazz made the first basket, Butler scored on a reverse layup to begin a 12-0 run. He also nailed a 3-pointer during that stretch as Philadelphia dominated early. But Utah closed to 54-52 at halftime following Derrick Favors' alley-oop dunk. Redick and Mike Muscala hit consecutive 3s early in the third quarter. However, the Jazz came back and went up 81-80 on Mitchell's jumper late in the quarter. ""Up until the end, we made a few mistakes, but we played passionate,"" Mitchell said. ""Honestly, they're a great team, but we had the game in the bag except for a few mistakes. I think the game just got away.""

"WASHINGTON --  Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson thinks the Nets can succeed without Caris LeVert. They took the first step toward proving it Friday night. Spencer Dinwiddie scored a season-best 25 points, D'Angelo Russell had 23 and the Nets beat the Washington Wizards 115-104 for their first win since LeVert's gruesome foot injury. ""It feels good because of those circumstances,"" Atkinson said. ""You want to confirm that we can still be a good team. We love Caris, we miss him, but we've got some good players in that locker room."" LeVert is Brooklyn's leading scorer but suffered what was originally feared to be a season-ending injury Monday. Doctors found no fractures, though, and he is expected to avoid surgery and return later this season from a dislocated foot. Jarrett Allen had 16 points and 12 rebounds in his return after missing two games due to illness. The Nets had lost five straight in Washington and ended a three-game slide overall. ""Having his rim protection just changes the equation,"" Atkinson said of Allen. ""I thought we were excellent defending the rim tonight."" Dwight Howard scored a season-high 25 points for the Wizards before fouling out in the fourth quarter. He also grabbed 17 rebounds as Washington failed to win its fourth straight. Bradley Beal scored 20 points and John Wall had 16. But the All-Star backcourt duo combined to shoot only 14 for 38 on a night Washington went 3 of 17 from beyond the arc, posting season lows in makes and attempts. For the Nets and their NBA-leading 3-point defense, it was all according to plan. ""We wanted to make a point of being aggressive and stick with their stars,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Obviously, Wall and Beal are phenomenal players, and hopefully, if you can contain them, you set yourself up to beat the team."" Neither team led by more than six in the first half before Brooklyn used a 19-5 run to build a 79-64 advantage in the third. Russell scored eight of those points -- five from the foul line -- and found Joe Harris and Allen Crabbe for 3-pointers. Washington briefly got back within eight, but the Nets reclaimed a double-digit lead and kept it throughout the fourth quarter. ""We didn't make shots,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We turned the ball over and gave them a lot of opportunities. But defensively, we could not stay in front of the basketball."" CARIS COMING WITH? Atkinson is hopeful LeVert will be able to join the team on the road in the near future. ""Not right now, but I'd say soon,"" Atkinson said of LeVert's ability to travel. ""He's kind of walking around."" MID-RANGE MENTALITY Beal said part of his team's shooting struggles Friday came from overthinking whether to take the mid-range jumpers Brooklyn was inviting. ""I think the biggest thing with us is we just got to be confident in everything we do,"" Beal said. ""No matter what shot it is, man. A 3, a layup, a floater. Just be confident in everything we do. I think sometimes we second-guess a lot, and it gets us in trouble."" TIP-INS Nets: Russell scored 13 of Brooklyn's first 21 points on 6-of-8 shooting. ... F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson sat out with a sprained right ankle. Wizards: Had held opponents under 30 points for seven consecutive quarters before Brooklyn scored 30 in the second. ... Wall picked up his fourth technical foul of the season with 6:02 left in the third quarter, and his first flagrant with 59 second remaining in the game.","401070900"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  On a night that veteran Marc Gasol became Memphis' career rebound leader, it was the Grizzlies' youngster who showed off his offensive skills. Rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. scored a season-high 27 points, Gasol added 19 points and 15 rebounds and the Grizzlies defeated the Sacramento Kings 112-104 on Friday night. ""It means I've been here a long time,"" Gasol said laughingly deflecting talk of the rebounding record. ""If you play long enough and you're lucky enough, you're probably going to get some of those."" Jackson was the one who got the Grizzlies going early, as they built a 13-point lead. The 19-year-old from Michigan State was getting to the rim and converting as if the game plan was to use Jackson against the Kings front line. But it was more circumstantial than an opening strategy. ""Once we saw (a) mismatch and that he was feeling good about it and he was finishing strong to the basket, we got him going,"" Gasol said. Jackson added: ""That just comes from running the floor and making yourself open. It depends on how the game is going and how we feel it out. We don't really set our minds on anything."" Mike Conley added 19 points and six assists, while Garrett Temple finished with 14 points -- missing only one of his six shots -- as Memphis won its second straight. Gasol has 5,613 career rebounds, passing the franchise record of 5,612 by former Grizzlies standout Zach Randolph. De'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 23 points and 10 assists, while backcourt mate Buddy Hield scored 16 points. Bogdan Bogdanovic and Iman Shumpert added 12 points for Sacramento. ""I think he just keeps taking steps forward,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said of Fox. ""I think he will be hard on himself about having six turnovers. But I think he continues to improve."" Memphis built the lead to 14 points in the third quarter, and held an 11-point advantage near the midway point of the final period. A pair of 3-pointers by Troy Williams around a basket by Fox tightened things up. The Kings pulled within 107-104 with 1:55 left on a jumper by Fox, bringing the Memphis fans to their feet, as Joerger encouraged his team for another stop. But Gasol converted a three-point play with 1:41 left. Two more free throws from Gasol with 34.9 seconds left provided the final margin. The game was a conflict in tempo. Memphis tends to slow things down, while the Kings have been successful lately with a faster pace. In the second half, Sacramento outscored Memphis, but not enough to overcome a 62-51 Memphis lead at halftime. ""I think we got to it too late,"" Joerger said of increasing the pace. ""You have to try and speed teams like this up, and it's difficult to play from behind."" Fox added: ""They play so slow, and they get what they want. They get it where they want."" TIP-INS Kings: Randolph was at the game, but in street clothes. Randolph, who has been inactive for every Sacramento game this season, played for the Grizzlies eight seasons and still owns a house in Memphis. ... Hield and Fox were a combined 14 of 29 from the field, but Fox converted only one of his five shots from beyond the arc. ... Fox also committed six of Sacramento's 21 turnovers in the game. Grizzlies: Conley, an 83 percent free-throw shooter, missed four of his first eight from the line in the third quarter. ... Jackson's previous season high was 24 points against Atlanta on Oct. 19. He converted 11 of 16 shots. A FAMILY REUNION There are usually plenty of connections between teams in an NBA game, but the ties between the Kings and Grizzlies is a bit more. Beyond Randolph's All-Star career with Memphis, Joerger was with the franchise nine years, the last three as head coach. Joerger readily admits he enjoys his return to the city. ""I love coming back here,"" he said, noting not only did his family grow up in Memphis, but he did also in regards to his career. He later added: ""I speak well of the Grizzlies. To my guys, the older guys, they're so classy."" GASOL RECORD When Gasol grabbed his 15th rebound with little more than a minute left in the game, Randolph, in a suit rather than uniform, watched from the Kings bench as his former teammate surpassed his mark in the Grizzlies' record book. ""It had a little more motivation,"" Gasol said of breaking the record in front of Randolph. ""I wish he was on the floor, but I'm just happy he was watching.""","401070901"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Kevin Garnett showed up courtside, and that wasn't the only surprise in Minnesota on Friday night. In their first week without erstwhile defensive stalwart Jimmy Butler, the new-look Timberwolves locked down one of the Western Conference's top teams. Andrew Wiggins scored 23 points, Derrick Rose had 17 and the Wolves won their third straight game since trading Butler by beating the Portland Trail Blazers 112-96 on Friday night. Wearing a new purple-and-black alternate jersey on a Prince-themed night, Garnett got the crowd going when the video board showed him sitting below the basket. Then the home team kept them cheering with a defensive effort that would've made the Wolves icon -- a ferocious defender in his prime -- proud. ""It was great to see him,"" Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""It was a long conversation with me and him to get him to come. So I'm happy he came and we played really well as a team. ""All he wants to do is see Minnesota succeed, so I'm just happy we gave him something to cheer about."" The Wolves entered the game allowed opposing teams to score an average of 116.2 points per game. They held the Blazers -- who were averaging 115.9 per game -- to their season low. Towns and Robert Covington each had 14 points for the Wolves, who are 7-1 at home and 3-0 since trading the disgruntled Butler to Philadelphia on Monday. Rose cautioned against reading too much into the success. ""We're still trying to figure things out,"" he said. ""It's always great to go 3-0, and we're just trying to keep it going, taking it one game at a time."" The Timberwolves' lineup had a balanced night, with all five starters scoring in double figures. It was a stark difference from the last time the teams met nearly two weeks ago, when the Blazers held Minnesota to 81 points -- the lowest point total in the NBA this season. The Wolves were without Butler, Jeff Teague and Rose for that game. ""I just think they have a new feel, a new lease on life in a sense,"" Evan Turner said. ""Anytime you get a trade and things like that, they feel good. They played well."" LOSING ON THE TRAIL The Blazers have their first losing streak of the season -- not the start they wanted for their six-game trip. CJ McCollum had 18 points and Damian Lillard added 16 for Portland, which never led. The Blazers got within six in the third quarter before Minnesota closed the period on a 21-11 run by attacking the basket. The Blazers committed 18 turnovers, leading to 22 Wolves points. ""The ball is in my hands a lot and the team counts on me to take care of the ball and make sure that we get quality possessions. I didn't do a great job of that,"" said Lillard, who had five turnovers. THE COLOR PURPLE The Wolves debuted their ""city edition"" uniforms that pay homage to hometown music legend Prince, who filmed his iconic nightclub scenes of the 1984 movie Purple Rain across the street from where Target Center was later built. Prince music played all night. ""I know our players are really excited about the uniforms and the night. It's a great way to honor Prince,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard had five assists to pass Damon Stoudamire (3,018) for third on the team's career list. He has 3,020 for his career. ... G Seth Curry sat out with a bruised right knee from the first quarter of Wednesday night's loss to the Lakers. Curry said Thursday his goal was to return during the team's current six-game road trip. Timberwolves: Taj Gibson had a season-high five assists, and Teague had a game-high eight. . F Anthony Tolliver didn't play for the second straight game. He told local media Friday that Thibodeau didn't talk to him about not playing in Wednesday night's win against New Orleans. Thibodeau, known for playing with a short bench, defended the decision to not play the usually reliable veteran. ""If you try to play too many then everyone plays poorly. So you try to make a decision, you gather information and it usually works out. You're going to need everyone over the course of the year.""","401070902"
"NEW ORLEANS --  If not for Anthony Davis' determination to dominate inside for most of his 40 minutes on the court, the New Orleans Pelicans could have been blown out by the New York Knicks. Davis scored a season-high 43 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, and New Orleans overcame an 11-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat New York 129-124 on Friday night. ""It felt like a grind,"" Davis said. ""Usually when I have those numbers, we're up 12, 15, 20. ... But they were up damn near the whole game. We just had to fight back and I was just trying to do my part."" Julius Randle had 19 points and 11 rebounds, including a crucial put-back of Davis' missed free throw to make it 124-121 with 1:23 left. ""Julius saved me when I missed two free throws at the end,"" Davis said. ""When I missed (the second one), I kind of put my head down a little bit and I seen a blue jersey flying in. So when he made it, I said, `Thank you.' I don't know where he came from, but wherever he came from, I appreciate it."" After Tim Hardaway Jr. missed a 3 for the tie, Holiday hit from deep to widen New Orleans' lead to six with 35 seconds left. Holiday overcame a shaky, turnover-plagued start to finish with 24 points and 10 assists. His late heroics included a rebound of his own miss inside the final two minutes, after which he dribbled out to the perimeter and fed an alley-oop lob to Davis. ""He missed a lot of bunnies at the start of the game and he didn't let it take away from his aggressiveness,"" Randle said about Holiday. ""He just kept going. He made huge shots and plays down the stretch."" The Knicks fell to a fourth straight loss after controlling nearly all but the final six minutes of the game. Hardaway scored 30 points, and Trey Burke had 24 on 10-fo-13 shooting for the Knicks. New York led by as many as 19 points in the first half before losing for the sixth time in seven games. Emmanuel Mudiay added 19 points. The Knicks shot 49 percent (48 of 98) but were outrebounded 54-44 and allowed the Pelicans to snag seven offensive rebounds and score eight second-chance points in the fourth quarter. ""We just couldn't come up with those rebounds at the end,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""We get them to miss the shot, but we don't come up with the loose ball. That happened multiple times down the stretch."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kevin Knox and Allonzo Trier each scored 11 points. ... Center Mitchell Robinson, who is from the New Orleans suburb of Chalmette, had seven points and seven rebounds in 24 minutes. ... Pelicans: Point guard Elfrid Payton returned to the lineup after missing nine games with a sprained right ankle, only to fracture a finger in his left hand after eight minutes on the court. He did not return to the game and missed all three of his shots before his latest injury. ... Nikola Mirotic had 12 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans. ... The Pelicans missed 24 of 34 3-point attempts and turned the ball over 15 times. ... New Orleans scored 68 points in the paint. SMALL BALL Fizdale elected to start the 6-foot-5 Trier in place of 6-9 forward Noah Vonleh on the wing. He said change had more to do with his curiosity about how that smaller lineup would play together than trying to create specific matchups against New Orleans. The Knicks played at a faster pace and surpassed their 106 points-per-game average with nearly eight minutes left. That showing apparently earned the lineup another look, despite the loss. ""After tonight I can't switch this one up,"" Fizdale said. ""I have to give them a chance to see if they can keep some consistency."" TALL BALL Davis said he and Randle were determined to get into the paint for shots and rebounds late when the Knicks remained with a smaller lineup. ""I really hate settling against smaller guys, so I just tried taking it inside, trying to get Julius to do the same thing,"" Davis said. ""There was nobody who could stop both of us on the inside. We just tried to make an effort to get down low and just punish them.""","401070903"
"MILWAUKEE --  Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer was seething over what he perceived as a lackadaisical effort in the first half Friday night and unloaded on his team at halftime. Message delivered. Eric Bledsoe scored 25 points, Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo each added 23 points and the Bucks erased a 22-point deficit and beat the Chicago Bulls 123-104. It was the Bucks' largest comeback win of the season and they tied the second-largest halftime deficit overcome in franchise history. Antetokounmpo described his coach's demeanor behind closed doors. ""He was mad,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""He was really upset. Coach came in and let us know that we weren't putting enough effort and energy into the game."" Antetokounmpo, Bledsoe and Middleton responded with a much better second half. Down 63-45 at the half, the Bucks outscored the Bulls 46-17 in the third quarter. Antetokounmpo's dunk capped a 31-11 surge and gave the Bucks their first lead since the opening minute at 76-74 with 3:22 left in the quarter. Bledsoe had 14 points, Middleton 11 and Antetokounmpo nine to help Milwaukee take a 91-80 lead into the fourth. Milwaukee started the season 7-0, but has alternated wins and losses over the last nine games The Bucks lost to Memphis 116-113 on Wednesday night. Jabari Parker and Justin Holiday, who led the Bulls to the big first-half lead, went cold in the third. Each had a basket and nobody else stepped up to stop the blowout. Parker scored 17 of his season-high 21 points, and Holiday added 18 of his season-high 20 in the first half. Holiday knew exactly how their lead evaporated. ""The name of the game is to able to play defense regardless of what's happening offensively,"" he said. ""Defensively, we didn't do our job."" Milwaukee never let the lead slip below 12 points in the fourth. The Bucks came in leading the NBA in points per game differential and maintained that margin, winning their 11th game by an average of 10.9 points per game. Holiday was perfect from beyond the arc for Chicago in the first half. He sank all six attempts, three in each quarter. The last one just before the end of the second pushed the Bulls' lead to 63-41. Parker keyed the Bulls' first quarter with 15 points, five off his season-high. He hit three 3-pointers and a pullup jumper that capped an 11-2 surge for a 16-point lead at 35-19. The Bulls' scrappy defense forced seven turnovers good for 15 points. TIP-INS Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen (right elbow sprain) has increased his workload during practice. Head coach Fred Hoiberg said Markkanen, who missed his 15th game, was one to two weeks away from possibly returning to action. Bucks: F Thon Maker could see more playing time with C John Henson (left wrist ligament) out indefinitely. Guards Matthew Dellavedova and Sterling Brown could be called upon with G Donte DiVincenzo (left quadriceps strain) out for the next three games. MEDICAL UPDATES ON BUCKS HENSON, DiVINCENZO C John Henson tore a left wrist ligament at Portland on Nov. 6, then played the next three games before reporting new discomfort Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies. An evaluation confirmed the injury. Surgery is scheduled for the near future. He was averaging 5.6 points, 5.1 rebounds and an assist in 13.5 minutes per game. Rookie G Donte DiVincenzo suffered a minor left quadriceps strain against the Grizzlies. He is expected to miss three games before being re-evaluated. In 14 games, he is averaging 6.4 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 18.1 minutes per game. STAT LINES Chicago converted 17 Bucks' turnovers into 30 points.

"NEW YORK --  Montrezl Harrell provided a big lift for the Los Angeles Clippers in the fourth quarter. Mom was pretty impressed. Harrell scored 10 of his 16 points in the final period, and the Clippers rallied to beat the Brooklyn Nets 127-118 on Saturday night for their fourth straight victory. Danilo Gallinari scored 28 points and Tobias Harris had 27 as Los Angeles opened a three-game trip with its sixth win in seven games overall. Lou Williams finished with 16 points and five assists. The 24-year-old Harrell also grabbed 10 rebounds while playing an NBA game in front of his mother, Selena, for the first time. ""My mom works two jobs and I also have two younger brothers, one which is still in high school, and one which is in college probably an hour and a half away from the house,"" Harrell said. ""So I still got two younger brothers at home that still are grinding to do their thing to pursue their dreams in their own careers. Her work schedule is kind of crazy."" Brooklyn lost for the fourth time in five games. Jarrett Allen had 24 points and 11 rebounds, and D'Angelo Russell added 23 points and 10 assists. The Clippers started out poorly and trailed by as many as 15 points midway through the first half. Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers was searching for a spark and went away from his original game plan before finding the right group, which included Harrell, Williams and three other reserves, to start the final period. The Clippers took their first lead of the game with 8:21 remaining after Williams made three free throws to make it 102-101. ""Nothing made sense, honestly,"" Rivers said. ""This was a game for us tonight that we had to throw every logical thing out and just try to find five guys that can make a run."" After Allen's free throws put Brooklyn up 110-108 with 5:21 to go, Harrell led the Clippers on a 9-0 run with six points, including a pair of free throws with 2:59 left to give Los Angeles a 117-110 lead. ""I thought their bench did a phenomenal job,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I thought they brought the energy. We obviously missed some shots, but I thought Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams, obviously those guys came in and changed the game."" Russell got Brooklyn within four on a 3-pointer with 2:09 remaining, but Gallinari's 17-foot jumper sealed it for Los Angeles. TIP-INS Clippers: G Avery Bradley was held out due to a sprained left ankle. He has missed the last six games. Nets: Allen's double-double was his fifth of the season after recording four in 72 games last season. MIND GAMES As Brooklyn was preparing to inbound the ball after calling timeout with 6:10 left in the first quarter, Russell was baited by Clippers point guard Patrick Beverley into picking up a technical foul. Beverley kept nudging Russell as they ran down the court to position themselves right under the arc before the Nets guard elbowed him. Beverley walked over to the referee to complain. He then got under Russell's skin as soon as the ball was about to be thrown in before the official whistled Russell for throwing an elbow.","401070905"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- JJ Redick jokingly bet new 76ers teammate Jimmy Butler on the bench that he wouldn't call ""game"" on the final shot. Butler responded with ""bet."" Butler, in his third game with his new team, drained a 3-pointer as time expired in overtime and Philadelphia overcame an NBA season-high 60 points from Kemba Walker to beat the Charlotte Hornets 122-119 on Saturday night. ""As much as I wanted the shot to go in to win the game, I also wanted it to go in because I didn't want Kemba to give me 70,"" Butler said with a laugh. ""I wanted it to stop at 60."" Walker's 60 points were a career high and topped Klay Thompson's 52 for Golden State against Chicago on Oct. 29 for most in the league this season. And after only scoring seven points in his last game, a loss at Cleveland on Tuesday, Walker set an all-time NBA record by increasing his total by 53 points from game to game. But the two-time All-Star was noticeably upset after the game about the team's third loss this season to the 76ers, two of which have come in overtime. ""I'm still proud, that's an unbelievable thing to do right there,"" Walker said of scoring 60 points. ""I'm just mad that we lost. I'm a competitor. It would have been even better with a win."" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown called Walker's effort ""amazing and incredible."" ""We tried double-teaming him, we tried hard-hedging him,"" Brown said. ""The reality of it is, is that you have Joel (Embiid) and Jimmy in that situation a lot and he is doing that against two all-league defensive players. He is just hard to guard and he is really unique. ... Sixty points in an NBA game against a pretty good defensive team is a remarkable effort."" Walker had 37 and 30 points in his previous two games against the 76ers, but only shot a combined 33 percent. This time he was making everything, including banking in a 3-pointer to give the Hornets the lead with 44 seconds left in regulation after they had trailed by 17 earlier in the game. Walker held up his palms and shrugged his shoulders after the ball went in, similar to that famous gesture by Hornets owner Michael Jordan many years ago with the Bulls. Walker finished 21 of 34 from the field and had six 3-pointers. He made all 12 foul shots and had seven rebounds and four assists. But while Walker had the big numbers, Butler made the big plays. Along with his game-winner, he also blocked Walker's shot on a drive with 15 seconds left and then saved the ball from going out of bounds. Walker thought he got fouled, but it wasn't called. ""That was an incredible 20 seconds of Jimmy Butler,"" Brown said. Said Butler: ""I didn't think (Walker) would settle for a jump shot in that moment. So he did what I wanted him to do (and drove). I just got a piece of the ball."" As for the game-winner, he said it's a shot he practices often, and worked on it 50 times earlier that morning. Since the start of last season, Butler had been 0-for-11 on game-tying or go-ahead field goal attempts in the final 10 seconds -- the most misses without a make in the NBA. BUTLER ADJUSTING Butler scored 15 points and said he is adapting well to his new teammates. ""Basketball is basketball to me,"" he said. ""We play basketball the right way. We guard and we are in it together. We are going to have practice time (coming up) and I will pick up quicker sooner rather than later."" BIG AGAIN Embiid finished with 33 points and 11 rebounds and Ben Simmons had 23 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists as the 76ers defeated Charlotte for the third time this season. Embiid has feasted on the Hornets this season, with 42 points and 18 rebounds and 27 points and 15 rebounds in his previous two games. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Muggsy Bogues and Dell Curry were among those on hand as Charlotte celebrated its recently selected 30th anniversary team.

Simmons threw an alley-oop pass to a breaking Butler from three-quarters court. Hornets: Nic Batum, who has struggled of late, was booed by the home crowd after an airball in the third quarter.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  With All-Star Victor Oladipo out for most of the game, the Pacers relied on a veteran and a rookie to put away the Hawks. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 22 points, hitting a late 3-pointer and a pair of free throws to seal the win, as Indiana beat Atlanta 97-89 on Saturday night. ""Bogey is always aggressive,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""He's looking to attack. Tonight, in the second half of the fourth quarter, he really made some big shots."" Rookie Aaron Holiday came off the bench and scored 12 points, all in the second half, including nine in the fourth quarter. Darren Collison also scored 12 and Thaddeus Young had 11 points and seven rebounds for the Pacers. ""I'm a competitor so if I get the chance, I'm going to go out there and take advantage, and that's what I did,"" said Holiday, who hadn't played since a 119-107 win at Cleveland on Oct. 27. ""I just went out there and played my game."" Oladipo, who was a game-time decision with a sore right knee, started but didn't last long. He left for the locker room with 7:22 remaining in the first quarter after falling into a broadcast cameraman and fans sitting courtside. Reserve Jeremy Lin scored 16 points and Kent Bazemore had 13 points, five rebounds and four steals for the Hawks, who have lost seven straight. The Pacers used an 11-0 run to take the lead for good late in the third quarter. Collison, who scored 10 points in the third, made a 3-pointer before Holiday hit a 3 to put Indiana ahead 68-67 with 2:39 left in the quarter, and the Pacers led the rest of the way. ""Just trying to get a group to finish a game,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Most good teams put their foot on the gas and they keep going."" It was Indiana's second win in two nights after a 99-91 victory over Miami on Friday, and neither of them had big contributions from Oladipo, who scored eight points against the Heat. John Collins converted a three-point play to put the Hawks ahead 34-30 at the start of a 9-0 spurt that ended with Trae Young's layup to make it 40-30 with 6:43 left in the second quarter. The Pacers answered with back-to-back baskets by Turner, and Bogdanovic converted a three-point play and then hit a 3-pointer to put Indiana ahead 47-44 with 2:48 remaining in the quarter. The Hawks closed out the half scoring 12 straight to take a 56-47 lead at the break. MILESTONE WIN McMillan got his 100th victory with the Pacers. Now in his third season, McMillan is 100-80 in the regular season and 3-8 in the playoffs. He's 578-532 overall as an NBA coach with a 17-28 playoff record. FAMILIAR FACE Alex Poythress got his first start with the Hawks against the team he spent the 2017-18 season with. He appeared in 25 games for the Pacers last season and signed a two-way contract with Atlanta in August. He left Saturday's game with 6:35 remaining in the third quarter with a left ankle contusion.

"LeBron James talks about returning to Miami as a member of the Lakers and says that he's not the person to ask about Carmelo Anthony. (1:26) ORLANDO, Fla. --  There was a closer on the floor when the Lakers faced the Magic, and it wasn't LeBron James. Nikola Vucevic had 36 points, including eight straight in a crucial stretch of the fourth quarter, and Orlando beat Los Angeles 130-117 on Saturday night, ending the Lakers' four-game winning streak. James was on the bench the entire fourth quarter as the Lakers went to a small lineup to trim a 21-point deficit to just 10 with more than four minutes to play. Vucevic snuffed out the rally right there, getting a three-point play against Michael Beasley and following that with five more points to push the advantage back to 13 with just over two minutes to go. ""We have other guys who could do that, but it is a responsibility I take on myself to finish out games, especially when I have it going,"" Vucevic said. ""I had a good matchup and I wanted to keep it going, that's all."" Vucevic hit 15 of 23 shots, including 10 of 14 in the second half. He got help from D.J. Augustin, who had 22 points and seven assists, and Evan Fournier, who scored 15. Terrence Ross had 13 points and Aaron Gordon and Jonathon Simmons scored 12 each for the Magic. ""When teams downsize, they're not going to be able to guard (Vucevic) 1-on-1,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""He's either going to be able to get good shots like he did tonight, or we're going to be able to play out of double-team, where he is a great passer."" The Lakers got 22 points from James, 19 from Lance Stephenson and 17 from Brandon Ingram, but were down 15 early in the second half and never got closer than 10 in the fourth quarter. ""I give credit to that group that was out there,"" James said. ""They continued to fight."" ""I always appreciate guys not giving up,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""If you're up or down 20, a NBA game is never over. We gave ourselves a chance and unfortunately they hit some shots that took the lead back up."" James averaged 29.8 points on 55.1 percent shooting during the win streak, but wasn't much of a factor against the Magic. Orlando opened the second half with back-to-back 3-pointers from Augustin and Fournier and a dunk from Vucevic that pushed the lead to 70-55. The Lakers finally extended their defense, opening easy lanes to the basket, and Augustin and Fournier took advantage. The two went unimpeded to the rim, feeding Vucevic, who had 16 points in the quarter, or getting easy layups for themselves. Ten of the next 11 Magic baskets were layups, and Orlando led 100-81 by the end of the third. TIP-INS Lakers: Lonzo Ball is shooting 51.3 percent (19 of 37) from 3-point range, but just 17.8 percent (five of 28) in road games. ... Three Lakers reserves reached double figures, led by Stephenson's 19 points. Josh Hart had 13 and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 10. Magic: Jonathon Isaac had four blocks in the first half, including two against James. He finished with five blocks and seven points. ... The Magic and Lakers have split the season series seven years in a row. This was their first meeting this season. RONDO OUT Rajon Rondo will miss four to five weeks after having surgery to repair a broken bone in his right hand. Rondo started only two games this season and was averaging 8.5 points and 6.5 assists while playing 25 minutes a game. ""Obviously he is missed,"" Walton said. ""You can feel it around the locker room, but our group has been good."" CARMELO A LAKER? James was asked about the possibility of Carmelo Anthony joining the Lakers roster and said: ""I have no idea, to be honest. That's not a question to ask me. We don't even have a roster spot open right now, so that is not a question for me.""","401070908"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis had 10 field goals for New Orleans against Denver on Saturday night. That's not a bad total, but it doesn't begin to tell the whole story about how he carried the Pelicans. Davis added 20-for-21 shooting from the free throw line and finished with 40 points, eight rebounds and eight assists as the Pelicans defeated the Nuggets 125-115 Saturday night. Davis' performance on Saturday followed a 43-point effort a night earlier in a win over New York. ""It's pretty hard to stop him, especially when he gets in a groove like that,"" said Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, who overcame foul trouble to finish with 19 points and match Davis' assists. ""We don't think anyone can guard him in the first place."" Julius Randle had 21 points and 10 rebounds, Nikola Mirotic had 20 points and 10 rebounds and E'Twaun Moore scored 13 for New Orleans, which won for the fifth time in six games. Nikola Jokic had 25 points and 10 rebounds, Gary Harris scored 24, Juancho Hernangomez had 20 points and 11 rebounds, Monte Morris came off the bench to add 13 and Jamal Murray had 11 for the Nuggets, who lost for the fifth time in six games. Davis' assists tied a career-high and it was his seventh game with at least six assists this season. In his previous six seasons, he had just eight such games. ""I just realized that a lot of teams are scouting for me,"" Davis said. ""They didn't want me to go off I guess, so I'm just trying to find guys and guys are playing with a lot of confidence and making shots. They know and I know where they are going to be and they know where I like them to be."" The Pelicans made 31 of 34 free throws, and the Nuggets made 8 of 13. ""I felt we were doing things that should've generated some more free throws,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""Obviously, the referees didn't see it that way tonight. They saw them getting fouled quite a bit."" The Pelicans, who rallied from a 19-point deficit against the Knicks, had a much easier time against the Nuggets. Though Denver got off to a fast start, New Orleans took the lead late in the first quarter and never trailed again. Davis scored 12 points as the Pelicans held a 37-35 lead after the first quarter. He wound up with 12 at halftime as his team clung to a 70-67 halftime lead and even though he had just four points in the third quarter, New Orleans took a 98-88 lead into the final period. The Nuggets got within seven points three times early in the fourth quarter, but Davis and Holiday scored four points each during an 8-0 run that gave New Orleans a 110-95 lead midway through the quarter. The closest Denver got after that was nine points. ""It's hard to stop him,"" Jokic said of Davis. ""He's a really great player. We didn't do a good job tonight."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was coming off a season-high point total in a 138-93 home victory against Atlanta on Monday. . The Nuggets outscored the Pelicans 58-82 in the paint. Pelicans: The Pelicans had four scorers in double figures by the middle of the second quarter. ... Randle had all but six of the points and four of the rebounds that came from New Orleans' bench. . Holiday went to the bench midway through the third quarter after committing his fourth foul. PAYTON OUT INDEFINITELY Pelicans G Elfrid Payton will see a hand surgeon next week to get an evaluation of the broken little finger on his left hand that he sustained against the Knicks on Friday. It was Payton's first game back in the lineup after missing nine straight due to a sprained right ankle. JOKIC COOLS OFF Jokic leads the Nuggets with a scoring average of 17. 1 points per game, and he surpassed that in the first quarter. But after scoring 18 first-quarter points, Jokic cooled off. He finished with 25 points, the team-high, on 10-of-20 shooting and had 10 rebounds.","401070909"
"BOSTON --  Donovan Mitchell was much more efficient leading Utah in scoring this time. Mitchell had 28 points and six assists, bouncing back from one of his worst performances of the season and leading the Jazz to a 98-86 win over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night. ""I didn't really do too much but just being in the right spot and keeping my mind focused on the game plan,"" said Mitchell, who also had three steals and made a big block as Utah pulled away in the fourth quarter. Although he scored 31 Friday night in Philadelphia, he made only 13 of 35 attempts and didn't have an assist as the Jazz lost to the 76ers 113-107. Against Boston, he was 10 for 21 from the field and 3 for 4 at the free-throw line. ""I had no time to think about it. I didn't watch the film from the game, actually,"" Mitchell said. ""Didn't even think about that game. Just went out there and hooped."" Ricky Rubio scored 20 points for Utah, which beat Boston for the second time in eight days and swept the season series. Rudy Gobert had 12 points and nine rebounds, and Derrick Favors finished with 10 points and eight boards. Utah improved from 15 assists in Philadelphia to 23 against the Celtics. ""We a lot of guys that can make shots, and when we move the ball, find the open man, we shoot with more confidence and they go in,"" Gobert said. Boston scored its fewest points since a 93-90 loss at Orlando on Oct. 22. ""We have to build a tougher team mindset than we have,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Kyrie Irving had 20 points for the Celtics, who had won two in a row. Jayson Tatum finished with 10, but no other player scored in double figures for Boston. ""There are times when we play really tough. And then we just have, for whatever reason, moments in the game that turn into extended moments in the game when we're not,"" said Gordon Hayward, who was held to seven points against his former club. ""We've got to figure out how we can play a full 48 minutes and then do it again the next night when we play. We're still not there yet."" The Celtics were just 8 for 26 from the field in the third quarter. They had to play much of the period without Irving, who fouled Mitchell on a 3-pointer with 5:40 left. Mitchell made all three from the line to put Utah up 68-55, and then Irving picked up his fifth foul just 28 seconds later. Irving returned in the fourth, but Boston was unable to catch up. Mitchell blocked a dunk attempt by Hayward and Utah took it the other way for an alley-oop dunk by Favors from Geoges Niang to put the Jazz up 83-64 with 9:07 left to play. Utah ended a two-game losing streak, which started with a 118-68 loss at Dallas on Wednesday. DAY AFTER The Celtics were coming off a 123-116 overtime win against Toronto. After shooting 52.8 percent Friday against the Raptors, the Celtics struggled to make 35 of 91 shots against the Jazz and went 11 of 20 from the foul line. Stevens had seen enough and pulled most of his starters with about eight minutes left to play. ""He felt like we really weren't going anywhere,"" said Al Horford, who scored nine for Boston. ""It can't only be one or two guys doing the things we all have to do and be consistent with it."" DOUBLE T In the second quarter, Irving caught Rubio on a crossover dribble, giving himself a wide-open look at a 3-pointer that got the Celtics within 49-45 with 33 seconds left in the half. There was a brief confrontation at midcourt that led to technical fouls on Boston's Marcus Smart and Utah's Joe Ingles. TIP-INS Jazz: Led 50-45 at halftime despite going 4 for 11 from the foul line in the first half. ... Dante Exum had 10 points and seven rebounds. Celtics: Irving picked up his third foul with 2:59 left in the second quarter.","401070910"
"CHICAGO --  With Kawhi Leonard sitting out, Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse inserted Fred VanVleet into the starting lineup Saturday night hoping it would snap the reserve guard out of a recent funk. Mission accomplished. VanVleet scored 18 points, Danny Green added 17 and Serge Ibaka had 16 points and four blocks, sending the short-handed Raptors to a 122-83 rout of the Chicago Bulls that snapped their three-game losing streak. Leonard, the team's leading scorer, was held out after playing 43 minutes in an overtime loss Friday night at Boston. He played in just nine games last season and has yet to appear in back-to-back games this season. Green went 7 for 7 from the field, including 3 of 3 on 3-pointers. VanVleet, who entered shooting just 36.1 percent from the floor, was 7 for 11 -- including 4 of 7 on 3s. ""Obviously, getting out there and getting an extended run is helpful to get a rhythm,"" VanVleet said. ""But at the end of the day, I just have to make shots, and tonight I was able to do that."" Antonio Blakeney had 13 points and Justin Holiday and Jabari Parker each added 12 for the Bulls, who have dropped four straight. Chicago also played without its leading scorer, Zach LaVine, who sat out with an illness. LaVine first experienced symptoms Thursday night and struggled through Friday night's game at Milwaukee. Without him, the Bulls struggled on offense, making just 30 of 86 field goal attempts (34.9 percent) and committing 22 turnovers. ""We didn't have a rhythm,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We had trouble executing, we allowed them to crawl up into us and there were way too many turnovers."" VanVleet had 10 first-half points on 4-for-8 shooting. Pascal Siakam also scored 10 and Green led the way with 14 as Toronto took a 57-44 halftime lead. The Bulls managed just nine points in the third quarter (on 4-for-19 shooting) as the Raptors opened an 89-56 lead entering the fourth. VanVleet had eight points and made all three of his shots in the third. ""He really looked like his old self,"" Nurse said. ""He's been a shell of himself lately, in all phases. Not getting the ball where he wants to go. Not shooting the 3 at a high level. In my head, he's a 45-plus shooter and he's shooting somewhere in the 20s this year. ""He just looked like a different guy out there, and that's good."" None of Toronto's starters played in the fourth, but the Raptors still managed to stretch the lead to 40 points. ""We need to do something,"" Chicago rookie Wendell Carter Jr. said. ""Try our hardest, don't quit and play as hard as you can until the last second."" SECOND-HALF WOES The Bulls were outscored 65-39 in the second half, a day after being outscored 78-41 after halftime at Milwaukee. HOME COOKING Besides starting, VanVleet got a lift from playing in the United Center. He's from Rockford, about a 90-minute drive away, and had family and friends in attendance. ""It's always great to play here,"" VanVleet said. BOTTOMS UP Bulls center Robin Lopez displayed a unique celebration after hitting a 3-pointer in the first half. As he headed back on defense, Lopez pantomimed opening a can of beer and taking a swig. It was his first 3 of the season. TIP-INS Raptors: G Kyle Lowry didn't return after tweaking an ankle in the third quarter. Lowry, though, said afterward that's he's fine. ... OG Anunoby (sprained right wrist), C.J. Miles (right adductor strain) and Norman Powell (left shoulder) didn't play. Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen, sidelined since the preseason with a sprained right elbow, is close to being cleared for contact. ""We'll see,"" Hoiberg said. ""He just had a great workout before we had our walkthrough out there and he's making progress, and that's the important thing.""","401070911"
"HOUSTON --  Houston's offense continues to improve, and the Rockets keep on winning. James Harden had 34 points and eight assists, and the Rockets used a big first-half run on the way to their fourth straight victory, a 132-112 win over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night. Harden, who shot 10 of 17 from the field, had 15 points in the third quarter. Chris Paul added 24 points and nine assists, including 18 points in the first half, as the Rockets built a 71-59 halftime lead. ""Yeah, tonight we did a really good job,"" Harden said. ""Other than our turnovers, I think the pace, guard, offense, defensively how active we were. It's pretty much a complete game."" Clint Capella finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds for Houston, which shot 57 percent from the floor, including 20 of 47 from 3-point range. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said the Rockets were able to find the open shooters, and that was orchestrated by Harden and Paul. ""That's Clint being such a presence in the middle that he opens the outside up, and he was open for himself,"" D'Antoni said. ""So it was a good balance."" After starting the season 1-5, Houston has won seven of its last nine games to move above .500 for the first time. ""We're making shots, playing the right pace, and it's our defensive end though,"" Paul said. ""We gave up over 100 tonight, but for the most part, the defense was good."" Buddy Hield shot 10 for 17 and finished with 23 points and seven rebounds to lead the Kings, who have lost three of their last four games. ""This is a tough team to play on the back end of a back-to-back, and they were rested, they were focused, they were locked in and they do it well, they do it really well,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We tried to give them different looks. We're not at a college or graduate level experience wise in playing pick-and-rolls the way these guys are a scientist at it."" De'Aaron Fox added 19 points, and Marvin Bagley had 16 points off the bench for Sacramento, which shot 45 percent from the field. ""Sometimes we just didn't make shots, although we scored 112 points and should've been able to give ourselves a chance to win,"" Fox said. ""We just have to be able to get stops out there."" Houston used a 20-5 run at the end of the first quarter and start of the second to open a 45-32 lead. Eric Gordon hit consecutive 3-pointers with 10 minutes left in the second and Paul had 12 in the run. Houston's lead grew to 57-41 on a Gary Clark 3-pointer with 5  1/2 left in the first half that capped a 9-0 run. The Rockets pushed the lead to 98-74 with four minutes left in the third when Harden scored 10 straight points. The Kings got no closer than 15 points the rest of the way.

"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic gave the Dallas Mavericks a glimpse of an exciting future -- and extended a bad week for the Golden State Warriors. The rookie scored 24 points, including a short jumper that put Dallas in front for good, and the Mavericks beat the Warriors 112-109 on Saturday night. The 19-year-old from Slovenia arrived in the NBA having led Real Madrid to the 2018 Euro League title. On Saturday, he hit a 10-footer in the lane with 1:10 left to put Dallas up 109-108, then sealed the game with two free throws with seven seconds remaining. ""I've been doing this when I was in Madrid, too,"" Doncic said. ""I love the last-minute shot. (But) of course it's different. It's the NBA. It's the best league in the world."" Golden State played without injured starters Stephen Curry and Draymond Green and lost for the fourth time in six games. The Warriors dropped back-to-back games for the first time this season, and Saturday they led by eight points in the second half before the Mavs rallied. Kevin Durant scored 32 points, but only three in the fourth quarter on 1-for-7 shooting. Klay Thompson added 22 for the two-time defending NBA champions. Durant missed two shots and Thompson one in the final minute, all of which could have either tied the game or put Golden State ahead. ""You don't set NBA records being frustrated,"" Thompson said. ""I'm not going to go over here and dwell on missing a couple of shots, missing a game-tying shot this early in the season."" Harrison Barnes had 23 points for the Mavericks, who have won four in a row. It was just the second time Dallas has beaten Golden State in their past 19 meetings, the other coming on Dec. 30, 2015 -- one of only nine games the Warriors lost that regular season. An 8-0 Mavs run early in the fourth quarter, capped by Dwight Powell's three-point play, gave Dallas its first lead since early in the third quarter, 93-92, with 9:18 to play. After Golden State surged ahead again, the Mavericks hung tough and Dorian Finney-Smith's fast-break layup put Dallas back up 107-106 with 1:45 remaining. ""Our guys worked incredibly hard to wear on them throughout the game and we made their shots a little more difficult,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When you work as hard as we did, you get luck to go your way."" In addition to missing Curry (left groin strain) and Green (right toe sprain) in the midst of this rough stretch, the Warriors are still trying to repair the bad feelings caused by Green's dust-up Monday night with Durant and subsequent suspension. ""Just trying to move forward,"" Durant said. ""Are we going to talk about this the whole year? We just want to play ball. I know that's all I want to do."" COULDA COST THEM Dallas, a 76 percent free throw-shooting team for the season, struggled in going 22 of 34 at the line, though Doncic came through when it mattered most. Dennis Smith Jr. was 2 for 7, and Barnes was an uncharacteristic 7 for 11. ""I love that we are getting to the line, to put a positive bent on it,"" Carlisle said. REPLACEMENTS COME THROUGH The Warriors got valuable contributions from reserves Quinn Cook and Damion Lee, the latter playing on a two-way contract. Cook scored 15 points and Lee a season-high 13. Lee had 11 first-half points, the same amount he had scored in 24 minutes of action all season prior to Saturday. He had eight points in a 22-11 second-quarter run that gave Golden State a 44-37 lead. TIP-INS Warriors: Durant and coach Steve Kerr received technical fouls for protesting when Durant was called for traveling after being bumped in a Mavericks double-team with 1:01 left in the first quarter. Barnes' ensuing free throws gave Dallas its biggest lead, 26-18. ... Kerr said Green would ""almost for sure"" miss the team's game Sunday at San Antonio and then be re-evaluated before the Warriors host Oklahoma City on Wednesday. ... Curry said he was hopeful he would return to action later this month as he continues his rehab. Mavericks: Wesley Matthews missed his second game in the past three with a left hamstring strain. He played 20 minutes Wednesday against the Jazz. ... Smith, a 2018 Slam Dunk Contest finalist, had an embarrassing moment in the first quarter when he missed an uncontested breakaway attempt.

"PHOENIX --  Still without Russell Westbrook, the Oklahoma City Thunder keep winning. Paul George scored 32 points, Steven Adams added 26 and the Thunder beat the Phoenix Suns 110-100 on Saturday night, their 10th victory in 11 games. The Thunder played without Westbrook for the sixth straight game. He missed the first five with a sprained ankle, but the team said his absence on Saturday was for ""personal reasons."" But Oklahoma City was in control most of the night anyway, leading by as many as 18 points and beating the Suns for the third time this season with two of the victories coming without Westbrook. George said the Thunder just know each other well. ""We've been together,"" he said. ""I can't say that enough. There's no more confusion, there's no more trying to figure it out. We know what to do. We've been together long enough now to know what to do in those moments."" T.J. Warren scored 23, Deandre Ayton 21 and Devin Booker 16 for Phoenix, which was trying to win consecutive games for the first time this season after beating San Antonio on Wednesday night. The rookie Ayton was able to score, but still had a rough night against the physical Adams. ""That's a tough matchup,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""As we know, Steven Adams is one of the most dominant five-men in the league right now. ... I think he (Ayton) competed in every play, he was more vocal, he was better than the first game, second game."" Ayton said the Thunder ""just made their shots and got to the line more than us. I know that we played and I know that we competed. The emotions were flowing on the bench. Everybody was really into it. ... Every game we play against them we get better and better."" The Thunder outscored Phoenix 17-4 to start the second half, capped by an 11-0 run that put Oklahoma City up 64-46 on George's 20-footer with 7:05 left in the third quarter. Booker and Josh Jackson each sank 3s in an 8-0 spurt that cut it to 64-54. But Oklahoma City, dominating the game inside, rebuilt the lead to 18 before Jamal Crawford scored the last four points of the quarter to cut the Thunder's advantage to 79-65 entering the fourth. Down 93-78 after George's two free throws with 5:27 to play, the Suns mounted an 11-2 run to cut it to 95-89 on Warren's 3-pointer with 3:45 remaining. But Adams scored on an offensive rebound and broke free for a dunk and was fouled for a three-point play to boost the lead to 100-89. Phoenix never came closer than seven after that. ""If you don't defend the 3-point line, it changes in a hurry,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said, ""and that's what really changed the game but I give our guys credit when it got to six. We kind of closed out, made some plays, got it back up to 10 and it was 10 the last two minutes of the game."" The game was close through a sloppy first half, when neither team could shoot better than 38 percent. Oklahoma City led 47-42 at the break, despite 12 turnovers. But Phoenix could turn them into just seven points. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook practiced with the team on Friday and was at the Saturday shoot-around. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  With Mike Conley finally healthy to rejoin teammate Marc Gasol, and adding 6-foot-11, 242-poound rookie Jaren Jackson Jr., the Memphis Grizzlies have gone back to their long-trusted approach of physical defense. It has got Memphis winning again, too. Gasol had 26 points and 13 rebounds, Conley added 18 points and nine assists and the Grizzlies pulled away to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 100-87 on Sunday. Memphis, which entered the game with the second-most points off turnovers in the NBA, forced Minnesota into 20 turnovers and turned them into 19 points in winning for the fifth time in six games. ""That's what gives us the best chance to win against any team,"" Gasol said about the physical style. ""I think that's who we try to be consistently. Obviously last year was a little glitch in the system, but for the past what, 10, 11, 12 years, this team has taken pride on being a very physical team, and that's what gives us the best chance to win."" Gasol's shooting helped the Grizzlies overcome their own sluggish offensive start. He was 4 of 7 from 3-point range and Memphis hit 12 overall. ""It's a game-changer,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of Gasol's outside shooting. ""Those shots break games open for you."" Gasol scored 18 points in the second half. Karl-Anthony Towns had 15 points and 20 rebounds for the Timberwolves. They had won three straight games since trading Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia. ""There was a physicality to the game that we probably didn't respond to as well as we could have or should have,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. The Wolves entered the game with the second-fewest turnovers in the NBA at 12.5 per game, but the Grizzlies were active early and forced Minnesota into eight turnovers in the first quarter. The Wolves had averaged 113 points per game in winning the first three games of the homestand after trading Butler. ""They play slow,"" Minnesota forward Robert Covington said. ""They played a part in it. We can't allow them to dictate our pace. We got to get the ball out, in transition we need to use our athleticism. Tonight, we weren't able to do that."" Dario Saric, who came over from the 76ers along with Covington, hit three 3-pointers and scored 11 points in the fourth. Saric hit a 3 to draw the Wolves within eight points, but Gasol hit a pair of 3s on consecutive possessions after a timeout.

GREEN RETURNS Forward JaMychal Green returned to the Grizzlies' lineup after missing 12 games with a broken jaw. Bickerstaff said he wanted to use Green in short increments. Off the bench, Green had eight points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes. ""I felt a little rust, got to get my legs back underneath me,"" Green said. ""But other than that, it was just fun to be out there. We played great defense tonight, we got a lot of stops. We're moving the ball well offensively.""","401070915"
"MIAMI --  There was a time when LeBron James getting pestered by Lance Stephenson would have worked out wonderfully for the Miami Heat. Sunday was not one of those times. The scenario: It was late in the game, the outcome was decided, and Stephenson -- James' former rival, now his teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers -- challenged him to finish the game off with a 3-pointer. ""I bet you won't go for the 3,"" Stephenson said. The Heat probably wish that conversation never took place. James' capped his 51-point night with a 32-foot 3-pointer in the final seconds, pointed at Stephenson to let him know he was wrong, and the Lakers rolled past the Heat 113-97 for their seventh win in their last nine games. James reached 50 for the 13th time in his career, including Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals. ""It's just playing with greatness,"" Lakers guard Lonzo Ball said. ""Tonight he took the game over."" James shot 19 for 31 from the field, 6 for 8 from 3-point range, became the seventh player to score at least 51 in a game against Miami, and started his two-game reunion tour in sensational fashion. The Lakers' next game is Wednesday night in Cleveland, the only other place besides Miami and L.A. that James has called home as a professional. ""It's always great to be here,"" said James, who hugged a slew of familiar faces in the arena he used to call home. ""We had some not-so-good times, we had more great times, so it's always a respect factor and a love for the people in Miami and especially the people who work here."" And finally, he left Miami a winner again. Since leaving the Heat after the 2014 NBA Finals James was 0-4 against Miami; his teams were 0-7, when including the three Cleveland-Miami games that he sat out for various reasons. James put on a show. The Heat threw a shoe. It was their fourth straight home loss and frustrations boiled over. Josh Richardson got ejected in the fourth quarter after throwing one of his sneakers into the stands, upset about a call that he felt he didn't get moments earlier. ""I just can't let that happen,"" Richardson said. Wayne Ellington scored 19 points for Miami (6-10), which is off to its second-worst start in the last 12 years. The Heat were 5-11 at this point of the 2016-17 season, the only other time they've been worse after 16 games in that span. Richardson and Tyler Johnson each scored 17 points for the Heat, while Rodney McGruder added 14. ""We're going to get to work,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra vowed. They need some health, too. Goran Dragic missed the game for Miami because of a right knee problem, one that will be further evaluated Monday. Dwyane Wade remained on leave after the birth of his daughter, and may return to the Heat this week. Miami hasn't forgotten James, obviously -- he still gets loud cheers when introduced in his former home arena -- but just in case anyone in attendance needed a reminder of his game, he delivered. He made eight of his first nine shots and had the whole arsenal working; dunks in transition, stepback 3-pointers, turnarounds from the baseline. ""When he's hitting shots like that, what do you want us to do?"" Heat center Hassan Whiteside mused. Even with James' greatness, the biggest shot for the Lakers might have come from Brandon Ingram with 3:46 left. Miami had clawed within eight and the shot clock was about to expire on the Lakers, but Ingram connected on a long jumper from the left wing to make it 104-94. From there, the only drama was whether James would get 50. And he did. ""Just give him the ball,"" Lakers guard Kyle Kuzma said, ""and get out of the way."" TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers arrived Saturday night after playing in Orlando and aren't scheduled to fly to Cleveland until Tuesday. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 19 points, Kuzma scored 15 and Ingram finished with 13. Heat: The last time Miami lost four straight at home was early in the 2014-15 season.... Miami had a five-shot possession in the third quarter, four offensive rebounds coming before Ellington made a 3-pointer. CONSISTENT LEBRON Whenever James changes teams -- Cleveland to Miami in 2010, Miami to Cleveland in 2014, Cleveland to the Lakers this past summer -- his new team starts 9-7. HEAT HELP James Johnson played for the first time this season after finally being declared good to go following offseason sports hernia surgery. He had four fouls in the first half and finished with eight points.","401070916"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Aaron Gordon dunked for the Orlando Magic just 20 seconds into the game, and the New York Knicks never caught up. Gordon scored 20 of his 31 points in the first quarter and the Magic held off two New York rallies to beat the skidding Knicks 131-117 on Sunday night. Nikola Vucevic had 28 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for Orlando, which has won seven of nine. The Magic shot 57 percent and set a season high for points, surpassing the 130 they put up Saturday night against the Los Angeles Lakers. It's the first time in franchise history Orlando has scored 130 in consecutive games. ""I guess it's just the ball movement,"" said Gordon, who made 13 of 17 shots. ""The ball was sticking a little bit earlier in the year, and the ball is jumping around the court. Everybody's passing and making the right reads all over the floor."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 32 for the Knicks, who lost their fifth straight. Trey Burke added 31 and Enes Kanter finished with 21 points and 19 rebounds. Orlando made its first 10 shots (seven by Gordon) and led 28-10 when D.J. Augustin hit a 3-pointer midway through the first quarter. Gordon had 20 points when he took a seat on the bench with 3:54 left in the period. ""It's one quarter every game,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""If you go back through all of them it's one quarter where the doors get blown off. I can't put my thumb on it. It's different mistakes every game, but it's a quarter. Somehow I've got to get it to where we can get 48 minutes out of this group."" Burke and Kanter came off the bench to get the Knicks back in it quickly. Burke scored 16 points in the first half and Kanter had 14 points and 16 rebounds, including nine at the offensive end. Noah Vonleh closed the first half with a 3 to leave the Knicks down 67-66. A layup by Gordon got Orlando's lead back up to 12 in the third quarter, but Burke and Hardaway answered with all of New York's points in an 11-2 run. Jonathan Isaac's big fourth quarter for Orlando included a block of Hardaway that led to a fast break and a dunk that left the Magic ahead 116-104 with 5:27 left. HEATING UP After their first eight games, the Magic were 2-6 and last in the NBA with a .414 field goal percentage. In the nine games since, they've shot 49.7 percent. ""Definitely our purpose of play is good,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""We're making a bunch of shots and Vucevic is just playing at an incredibly high level."" FRIGHT NIGHT The Knicks did not face Gordon when the teams played a week ago in New York, but they saw plenty of him in the rematch Sunday. ""That was no fun,"" Fizdale said. ""Aaron Gordon is one of the top 1 percent of athletes in this league. The fact he's now making his 3s, with that athleticism and his ability to put the ball on the floor, that's a scary thought."" TIP-INS Knicks: C Mitchell Robinson, who blocked nine Magic shots last Sunday, went to the bench with four fouls with 2:11 left in the second quarter. He played 75 seconds in the second half. ... F Mario Hezonga sat out a second straight game with what Fizdale described as ""either a stomach flu or food poisoning."" Hezonga played three seasons in Orlando after being drafted fifth overall in 2015. Magic: Matched a franchise record for one quarter with 44 points in the first. The mark was set against the Lakers on Feb. 8, 2008. ... Vucevic has averaged 25.5 points (on 59 percent shooting) and 11.7 rebounds in the last six games.","401070917"
"WASHINGTON --  Portland coach Terry Stotts was so pleased by a seven-pass possession capped by a 25-foot jumper by Jake Layman in the first quarter that he replayed the sequence at halftime. ""There's not a basketball person out there that wouldn't appreciate -- and then you've got to make the shot with the shot clock run down,"" Stotts said. ""But that's, that was pretty."" Damian Lillard scored 40 points, C.J. McCullom added 25 and Portland led the entire way, beating the Washington Wizards 119-109 on Sunday. ""That's perfect Blazer basketball. We need more possessions like that,"" Lillard said of the Layman shot that gave Portland a 17-point lead. Jusuf Nurkic had 13 points, 14 rebounds and matched his career high with eight assists for Portland. The Trail Blazers, coming off a 112-96 loss at Minnesota on Friday, snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 11-5. John Wall scored 24 points and Kelly Oubre, Jr. added 19 for the Wizards, who slipped to 5-11. The Trail Blazers started quickly, hitting 7 for 9 shots from 3-point range and taking a 32-12 lead with 3:54 remaining in the first quarter. Washington scored 15 straight and closed to 32-27, but Portland outscored the Wizards 30-14 and led 62-41 at the half. Lillard scored 13 points in the second quarter and added 18 in the third. Washington, which trailed by 29 points in the third, cut the deficit to 115-107 with 51 seconds to play. ""We've got to just play with more enthusiasm, more effort, more energy,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""That's embarrassing."" Wall said that he would try and continue to lead the Wizards, but was limited in what he could do ""You can't teach effort. You can't teach heart,"" Wall said. TIP INS Trail Blazers: G Seth Curry (right knee) missed his second straight game. ... F Maurice Harkless (left knee) sat out his 11th in a row. ... C Zach Collins and F Al-Farouq Aminu fouled out. Wizards: Brooks and Oubre were both assessed technical fouls. HOWARD HURTING Dwight Howard, who missed the first seven games of the season with gluteal soreness, aggravated the injury in the second quarter and was ruled out at halftime after scoring two points and picking up three fouls in seven minutes. ""We decided to sit him out, see how he feels day-to-day,"" Brooks said. ""We'll just see how he feels (Monday) and go from there."" FOURTH QUARTER COMEBACK Washington outscored Portland 39-28 in the fourth quarter to make the game relatively close. ""Look what happened,"" Brooks said. ""Guys off the bench. They played with passion, enthusiasm. That's what you've got to do in this league."" Washington's starting five played a combined 90 seconds in the fourth quarter, and Brooks was pleased his bench made things slightly better. ""They deserved to play, and they deserved to play more,"" Brooks said. THE REAL BLAZERS? Lillard and the rest of the Trail Blazers couldn't stop talking about the first quarter possession. ""If you could have one play and say this is how we want our offense to look, that would be the play,"" Lillard said. ""I think the fact we had that play happen early showed where our minds were."" ""Hopefully that ends up on some basketball highlight because we went from a good shot, good shot, good opportunity to a great-purpose shot in a full 24 seconds,"" veteran swingman Evan Turner said. NO PATIENCE FOR REFS Wall was asked if he was running out of patience with trying to deliver a leadership message. ""I'm not really running out of patience with that,"" Wall said. ""I'm running out of patience with the referees, I'll tell you that.""","401070918"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Finally faced with ""the real NBA,"" the Golden State Warriors are playing short-handed and having a hard time. LaMarcus Aldridge had 24 points and 18 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs fended off a late rally to beat Golden State 104-92 on Sunday night, extending the Warriors' skid to three games. The two-time defending NBA champions are 2-5 since an eight-game winning streak. ""We've had such a charmed existence the last four seasons. So, of course, this is the toughest stretch we've been in,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""This is the real NBA. We haven't been in the real NBA the last few years. We've been in this dream. So, now we're faced with real adversity. We've got to get out of it ourselves."" Stephen Curry and Draymond Green went down with injuries during the recent dry spell, but the biggest setback was self-inflicted. Green and Kevin Durant had a blowup at the close of regulation in a 121-116 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers last Monday. Green's tirades on the bench and in the postgame locker room led the team to hand the seventh-year forward a one-game suspension. The flare-up and the Warriors' inability to move past it spiritually has confounded Kerr. ""Just play with joy. It's always been about just our emotion,"" Durant said, describing how Kerr has encouraged his club. ""He's always been big about that. He's just trying to get that joy back."" There wasn't much joy to be found in San Antonio. DeMar DeRozan had 20 points and nine assists and Rudy Gay added 19 points to help the Spurs snap a three-game slide. ""We needed that one,"" Gay said. ""It was a hard-fought win for us. That's a team that needed this one, too, so it really was an uphill battle for us and good test for us."" Aldridge provided a needed boost, shooting 10 for 16 in scoring 20-plus points for the first time since Nov. 10. ""He's been aggressive, especially on the boards,"" DeRozan said. ""Tonight he got a couple shots to go in for him. A couple of his turnarounds went in, and you know that rhythm is going to continue to come. As long as he just goes out there, plays aggressive, lets the game come to him, he's going to continue to have big nights like tonight."" Durant scored 26 points and Klay Thompson had 25 for the Warriors. Golden State was without Curry and Green again, and their absence led to a cold start. Three nights after being held to a season-low output in a 107-86 loss at Houston, the Warriors nearly matched that dubious mark. They missed all six 3-point attempts in the first quarter as San Antonio jumped out to a 33-27 lead. Gay scored 12 points in the opening period. ""He is somebody that we have gone to at certain times in the game and that always gives players confidence,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. San Antonio also frustrated the Warriors on offense for much of the game. After quickly regaining an errant pass on their end of the court in the third quarter, Durant passed up a 3-pointer to fire a pass in the lane to Damian Jones only to have Gay stuff him at the rim. San Antonio finished with five blocked shots. Golden State's lone lead came when Andre Iguodala made two free throws to put the Warriors ahead 46-45 with 3:47 remaining in the second quarter. The lead lasted a minute as the Spurs closed the first half on an 11-2 run. TIP-INS Warriors: Curry, the two-time MVP, missed his sixth straight game with a strained left groin. Golden State is 2-4 without him. ... Green missed his second consecutive game with a strained right toe. ... Kerr got a technical foul 47 seconds into the second quarter after protesting a foul on Jonas Jerebko. ... Durant was called for a technical after complaining about a non-call on his first field goal attempt of the second half. Spurs: San Antonio has had a winning record for 3,355 days since 1997, most of any team in the league. Dallas is second at 2,407, followed by Houston with 2,340. . Aldridge has 202 games with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds since 2006. LeBron James has 203 such games during that same span. ... Pau Gasol missed his sixth straight game with a sore left foot. ... Davis Bertans sat out as he remains in the league's concussion protocol. PACK A LUNCH Kerr was asked if he planned to give Golden State a day off Monday following a three-game road trip as it prepares to host Oklahoma City on Wednesday. No way, he joked. ""They'll have a two-a-day tomorrow,"" Kerr said. ""I'm going back to the old days, Bobby Knight style."" The Warriors are off Monday. NOT SO BAD DeRozan experienced his first slump with the Spurs since joining the team in an offseason trade from Toronto. Popovich's attitude during the skid left DeRozan a bit surprised. ""He was more patient than I expected,"" DeRozan said. ""But like I said, we all have that feeling of understanding a lot of things are new. I know we keep saying it, but we're definitely making progress when we're going out there and playing. Very aggressive. We all want the same thing; we're all cheering for one another. It's just once we're more consistent with things defensively, you'll start to see games like tonight happen more often.""","401070919"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  The NBA's new scoring leader was determined his latest big night wouldn't go to waste. Kemba Walker scored 43 points, giving him 103 in his last two games, and the Charlotte Hornets battled back to beat the Boston Celtics 117-112 on Monday night. Walker followed up his NBA season-best, 60-point effort in an overtime loss to the 76ers on Saturday night with another spectacular performance. He scored 21 points in the fourth quarter and made 14 of 25 shots overall, including seven more 3-pointers. He finished 7 of 10 from the floor with four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter as Charlotte erased a 10-point deficit to pull even at 8-8 on the season. ""I just wanted to win, man,"" Walker said. ""I wanted to win a close game. We've been in every game for the most part. There's a couple we haven't been in but you know things just haven't been going our way in those situations and tonight it did and it felt good."" Walker passed Golden State's guard Stephen Curry to take over the NBA scoring lead at 29.6 points per game. Walker also passed the injured Curry for the league lead in 3-pointers made with 65. ""It means a lot but it's still the early season,"" Walker said. ""I would've never, ever in my life thought I would be that high up in the rankings as far as scoring in the NBA. But I'm going to try to keep it up, do what I can to win games."" Walker outdueled Boston's Kyrie Irving, who finished with 27 points and 11 assists. Jeremy Lamb had 18 points and Willy Hernangomez added 14 as the Hornets beat the Celtics for the first time in eight tries. The Celtics entered the fourth quarter leading 87-84 and quickly stretched the lead to double digits behind Irving, who scored and was fouled on a drive. But Walker refused to lose this time. The two-time All-Star simply took over, scoring on drives, midrange jumpers and from long distance. He scored 11 straight points in one stretch, including a 3-pointer from the right wing and a nifty Euro step move through the lane. ""He's been unbelievable, especially when your whole game plan is to stop him and he is still going off and doing what he does,"" said Celtics forward Gordon Hayward. ""He's an unbelievable player."" It was Walker who delivered the knockout punch with a clutch 3 from 27 feet away with 32 seconds left, bringing fans to their feet and putting the Hornets up by six. Irving missed two open 3s down the stretch and the Hornets escaped with the win to pull even at .500. After one big shot, a pumped-up Walker screamed ""This is my city!"" ""We were looking for another 60 but I think 43 will do tonight,"" joked Hornets coach James Borrego. ""He's incredible. This is a special player, a special performance and a special start to an NBA season."" TIP-INS Celtics: Jayson Tatum finished with 18 points and six rebounds. ... Finished 9 of 32 from 3-point range. Hornets: Nic Batum continued to struggle with his shot in the early going, missing his first four attempts before knocking down a pair of 3-pointers. Batum, who failed to score against the 76ers, had nine points. ... Malik Monk has missed his last 16 3-point attempts and didn't play in the second half. HAYWARD OFF THE BENCH Aron Baynes got the start over Hayward at forward for Boston. The change didn't matter all that much as both were 1 of 4 from the field in the first half. ""I'm OK with whatever I can do to help us win,"" Hayward said. ""Right now, I just have to focus on myself and getting myself better and being a better basketball player."" Coach Brad Stevens said it was more about getting Hayward in the right group, adding that ""we're probably not done tweaking the lineups."" PARKER'S BIG CONTRIBUTION Eighteen-year NBA veteran Tony Parker only had seven points, but made two clutch midrange jumpers in the final 2 minutes for the Hornets. Those possessions allowed Walker to play off the ball for a few possessions. ""Having Tony on the floor with him tonight allowed (Walker) to move off of the ball and that's what we try to do,"" Borrego said. ""We try to mix it up on them so they don't get locked in on his pick-and-roll. That's our job, to move him around and disguise him as much as we can.""","401070920"
"DETROIT --  Before Detroit's matchup with Cleveland, Pistons coach Dwane Casey stressed the importance of a good start. ""When the bell rings, we've got to be ready to run and play fast, and play together,"" Casey said. ""I've had it before and somehow, there's some reason we get off to that slow start, and we can't afford that."" Casey could have few complaints about his team's start Monday night. The Pistons shot 74 percent from the field in the first quarter and sailed to a 113-102 win over the Cavaliers. Andre Drummond had 23 points and 16 rebounds for the Pistons, Blake Griffin added 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Reggie Bullock scored 21 points. The Pistons led 66-46 at halftime, and the game was never close after that. ""We had a lot of positives,"" Casey said. ""I thought our defense was solid and we started the game well. I was on the team about the start and we scored 38 points in the first quarter."" The Cavaliers are now an NBA-worst 2-13 heading into their reunion with LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers play at Cleveland on Wednesday night. Drummond scored 13 points in the first quarter. The Pistons led 38-27 after one, then scored the first 11 points of the second. Bullock's 3-pointer in the final seconds made it a 20-point advantage at the half. The lead reached 30 in the third quarter before the Cavaliers went on an 18-2 run that lasted well into the fourth, making the final score a little more respectable. ""I feel like we were on a run, and we were rolling,"" Cleveland's Collin Sexton said. ""When it's like that, I feel like anything's possible."" Sexton led the Cavs with 18 points, and Jordan Clarkson contributed 16. RECORD The Pistons shot 13 of 38 from 3-point range. They've made at least 10 shots from beyond the arc in six straight games, tying a franchise record set last November. Bullock was 4 of 7 from long distance. ""We ran a lot of zone tonight, we weren't as sharp with our drops as far as where the ball is located,"" Cavs coach Larry Drew said. ""When you're playing against a team that shoots 3s, you just have to know where shooters are."" TEMPERS FLARE Four Detroit players were called for technical fouls in the fourth quarter. Stanley Johnson, Jose Calderon and Reggie Jackson received technicals within a 103-second span, and Drummond was called for one later in the quarter. ""Always like standing up for ourselves, but you're never going to beat the power of the whistle,"" Griffin said. ""I said to Coach Casey, it starts with me. I've gotten three technical fouls in the fourth quarter late in games, and early in the season, and I've set a bad precedent.""

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Pacers coach Nate McMillan saw exactly what he wanted Monday night. Big men Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner showed off their strength. Bojan Bogdanovic knocked down shots from the perimeter. Indiana shared the ball and played defense. With All-Star guard Victor Oladipo sidelined with an injured right knee, the Pacers delivered their most complete game of the season. Bogdanovic scored 21 points, Sabonis nearly had a triple-double and Turner added 12 points and six rebounds to lead the Pacers past the Utah Jazz 121-94. ""When I talk about ball movement and you get those opportunities from the (3-point line) and all over the place and you get everybody involved, this is what we're talking about,"" McMillan said. The result: Indiana won its third straight, all at home, and recorded its most lopsided victory since opening night. They didn't miss Oladipo one bit. Bogdanovic went 9 of 14 from the field, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Sabonis had 19 points, nine rebounds and a career-high nine assists in 26 minutes, and Turner wound up with four assists and three blocks. The Pacers also forced 18 turnovers, committed three and had a season-high 35 assists. The numbers only told part of the tale. ""They executed the game plan perfectly,"" McMillan said. ""We needed to get pressure on Utah. They do a good job of executing their half-court offense. I thought we did that, and then we got out (on offense) and played at the tempo we wanted."" Sure, it came against a weary opponent closing out a five-game trip. Ricky Rubio matched his season high with 28 points and had six assists and four turnovers. Center Rudy Gobert finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds but wasn't much of a factor. Jae Crowder scored 14 and was the only other Jazz player to reach double figures. Coach Quin Snyder even gave his starters some extra rest, pulling the last of his starters with 5:03 to play. ""They came out and blew stuff up,"" Donovan Mitchell said after scoring seven points. ""I had two turnovers early just from being loose with it. That set the tone."" It was never really close after Indiana jumped to a 19-12 lead and opened the second quarter on a 7-0 run to make it 39-19. Rubio answered with a 14-point scoring flurry in the second quarter, and a 3 from Joe Ingles cut the deficit to 47-41. Indiana answered with four straight points, closed the half with a 57-47 lead and started the second half on a 9-0 run to make it 71-53 and the Jazz never got closer than 12 the rest of the game. TIP-INS Jazz: Went 2/3 on the trip. ... Gobert has 15 double-doubles this season. ... Rubio and Gobert combined for 15 baskets. The rest of the team had 21. ... Ingles played in his 239th consecutive game, the NBA's second-longest active streak. ... Utah was outscored 33-11 on points off turnovers and was outrebounded 44-33. Pacers: Have won four of five and improved to 3-4 against Western Conference teams. ... Tyreke Evans made his first start with Indiana and had eight points and five assists in place of Oladipo. ... Rookie Aaron Holiday scored 19 points while Thaddeus Young and Doug McDermott each had 12. MISSING PIECE Following the game, McMillan pointed to one telling stat. Last season, the Pacers were winless without Oladipo. This season, they're 1-0. ""Tonight they stepped in as a team and played solid,"" he said. ""You've just got to find a way to go out and get it done."" THEY SAID IT Jazz: ""We have to play with more force, more precision defensively and we have to finish possessions and need everyone on the defensive end,"" Snyder said. ""They were more physical than us."" Pacers: ""I feel like every game we play and a little bit more and every game we play more, I feel like our chemistry builds,"" Sabonis said when asked about teaming with Turner.","401070922"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid gave another lesson in dominance. Only this time, Suns rookie Deandre Ayton actually was grateful for it. Embiid scored 19 of his 33 points after halftime and added 17 rebounds to help the Philadelphia 76ers beat Phoenix 119-114 on Monday night. Ben Simmons added 19 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for Philadelphia, which won its third straight while improving to 9-0 at home, remaining the only team in the league unbeaten at home. The 76ers play five of their next six in Philadelphia. Embiid upped his averages to 27.9 points and 13.1 rebounds while reaching at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in a game for the 11th time. He also has a league-leading 17 double-doubles. ""I know that's my job,"" Embiid said. ""They need me to dominate."" Ayton had 17 points and nine rebounds in his first matchup against fellow 7-footer Embiid. Embiid scoffed at analysts' comparisons of Ayton to him made on draft day, saying on Twitter: ""Don't compare Ayton to me either. I play DEFENSE."" The boisterous 76ers center then told ESPN in a preseason interview that Ayton was ""about to get his (butt) kicked."" To his credit, the No. 1 pick responded to pregame questions about Embiid by saying he would let his game do his talking. And Ayton did just that in the first possession, finishing Devin Booker's pass with an alley-oop dunk for an emphatic start to the game. Then, he forced Embiid into a turnover in the 76ers star's first touch on offense. But Embiid got the better from that point. Still, Ayton was glad for the on-court tutorial. ""It was fun to finally play against Joel,"" he said. ""The way he used his body, I'm going to use that, steal that. Thank you for teaching me. He put in a lot of work; I have to put in a lot of work, too."" Embiid downplayed his previous comments about Ayton and spoke favorably of him. ""A lot of people misunderstand me; I talk a lot of trash,"" Embiid said. ""He's talented and has a lot of potential. I'm a big fan."" Booker had 37 points and eight assists for the Suns, who started a four-game road trip with their sixth loss in seven games. Phoenix, which fell to 3-13 overall and 0-7 on the road, has the worst record in the West and is one of three winless road teams in the NBA. Strong first-half shooting helped Phoenix to a surprising 62-57 halftime lead. The 76ers took control in the third, going up for good on Embiid's three-point play 3:45 into the quarter. They ended the period ahead 92-86 and led by as many as 12 early in the fourth on J.J. Redick's runner. The Suns hung around and T.J. Warren's 3-pointer with 3:06 remaining cut it to 109-104. But Embiid's follow layup with 58 seconds left made it 114-106 and was the clincher. BUTLER'S  CONTRIBUTION Four-time All-Star Jimmy Butler, in his fourth game with the 76ers after last week's trade with Minnesota, had 16 points after hitting a 3-pointer as time expired in overtime to lead Philadelphia to a 122-119 win at Charlotte on Saturday. BRIDGES' HOMECOMING Philadelphia native and Villanova product Mikal Bridges had 13 points in 23 minutes for Phoenix. The rookie was drafted 10th by the 76ers before being shipped to the Suns for the No. 16 pick, Zhaire Smith, and a 2021 first-round pick. Smith has yet to play due to a left foot injury and an allergic food reaction that will sideline him at least until January.

"ATLANTA --  Montrezl Harrell doesn't mind trailing on the road when the Los Angeles Clippers still have a chance in the fourth quarter. ""It definitely builds your character,"" he said. ""We got the ball to the guys we wanted to get the ball to. We keep playing. We keep fighting."" Harrell had 25 points and 11 rebounds, Lou Williams added 16 points and a season-high 11 assists, and the Clippers rallied past the struggling Atlanta Hawks 127-119 on Monday night to win their fifth straight game. Tobias Harris scored 24 points and Mike Scott had a season-high 18 on six 3-pointers for the Clippers, who erased a 15-point deficit in the second half for the second consecutive game. The Clippers, playing without second-leading scorer Danilo Gallinari, improved to 11-5. At this point last season, after winning in Atlanta, they were 5-11. Trae Young scored 19 of his 25 points in the first half, and Taurean Prince had 21 points for the rebuilding Hawks, who dropped to 3-14 and have lost eight in a row. ""I know everybody in Atlanta wants us to win now,"" Young said. ""It's tough because we're right there. It's just that finish, and we're going to get it done."" Los Angeles trailed 87-72 in the third quarter, but went on a 20-4 run to take a 97-96 lead early in the fourth. Young lost the ball on the Atlanta end, and Williams whipped a pass across the baseline to Scott for a 3 that prompted the Hawks to call a timeout. Atlanta quickly regrouped, taking the lead back when Prince, who missed the previous two games with an Achilles injury, dunked on the ensuing possession. A 3-pointer by Alex Len put the Hawks up by five. It was all Los Angeles from there. Scott hit a 3 off an assist from Williams to give the Clippers the lead for good with 4:08 remaining. Williams fed Harrell for a strong reverse layup and a three-point play, and Harrell followed by knocking away Young's pass before Scott hit another 3 to make it 117-110. Williams, in his 14th season and second with the Clippers, knows his younger teammates depend on him to set the tone as the leader off the bench. ""I've seen a lot in this league,"" he said. ""I have probably been in every single position that you could be in. Whether it's being almost an All-Star, starting or coming off the bench, I have a lot of experience, and when I talk, guys listen."" Gallinari was sick and unable to play for the first time this season. Avery Bradley started in his spot after missing the last six games with a left ankle sprain, finishing with five points in 20 minutes. The Clippers have won seven of eight. Atlanta has dropped 12 of 13. Harris scored 12 points in the first period, but the Hawks were ahead by five entering the second. Young gave Atlanta its biggest lead at eight with a fast-break layup. Los Angeles went on a 15-3 run to take a 50-44 lead on Patrick Beverley's fast-break layup before the Hawks' 14-3 run put them up by seven on DeAndre' Bembry's free throws. Harris ended the first half with a long 3 that made it 64-61. ""We keep putting ourselves in holes, which is too dangerous,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""This is a really fun team to coach."" SOLID RETURN John Collins, in his second game back for Atlanta after missing the first 15 this season with a left ankle injury, had 18 points, six assists, three rebounds and five fouls in 21 minutes. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce had Collins on a limit of playing in bursts of 3-4 minutes before coming out. HURTING Hawks forward Omari Spellman started but left after four minutes with a bruised right hip. POOR TIMING Beverley was called for a technical in the third after disputing a foul call with official Courtney Kirkland, and Atlanta scored the next 11 points to take an 87-72 lead. Early in the fourth while he was on the bench, Beverley and Rivers made gestures of disbelief that Kirkland called a foul on Scott even though Len had his arms around him. Beverley did not return to the game.","401070924"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  While the rest of the NBA trends toward high-scoring, fast-paced offenses, the Memphis Grizzlies are relying on defense. And the longtime partnership of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Conley scored 28 points, Gasol had 17 points and 15 rebounds, and the Grizzlies pulled away over Dallas 98-88 on Monday night to snap the Mavericks' four-game winning streak. ""In today's league, I think a lot of teams are so used to things being easy, nobody really wants to play defense,"" Conley said. ""Everybody wants to get up and down and shoot 3s. So, when they come upon a team that gets into you and is physical and actually plays defense, it's a different game for them."" This one had 17 lead changes and 15 ties before Memphis reeled off 10 straight points in the late stages for the biggest lead in the game for either team. Garrett Temple and Conley each converted 3-pointers in the stretch that gave Memphis the lead for good. The Mavericks' 88 points were not only a season low, but the first time this season Dallas didn't reach 100. ""That's what Memphis is all about,"" said guard Dennis Smith Jr., who led the Mavericks 19 points. ""They've been like that for years."" Neither teams held a lead of more than six points until the final Memphis rally. Several Memphis players said their physical play can wear teams down, and at some point, cracks start showing in the opponents' play. As it did in the fourth quarter. ""I thought we played three tough, solid quarters,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""And then the fourth, we had some breakdowns."" Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 13 points and Temple added 12 as Memphis won its sixth in the last seven. DeAndre Jordan added 17 points and a season-high 20 rebounds. Luka Doncic had 15 points and 10 rebounds -- the rookie's first double-double of his career -- but was 6 of 20 from the field. The main impact from the Memphis defense wasn't on turnovers -- Dallas ended the game with 11 -- but rather the Mavericks shooting a season-low 34 percent. ""We want to be a unique team -- you see all these high, high scoring games -- that holds teams to under 90 points. And grinds out wins,"" Temple said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic was 0 of 6 in the first quarter before converting the first shot of the second quarter. ... Dallas made only four 3-pointers in the first half, including three by Dorian Finney-Smith. Doncic had the fourth one. ... Jordan has led Dallas in rebounding in all but one game this season (Harrison Barnes with 13 on Nov. 6 against Washington). ... The Maverick previous low in points for a game this season was in the season-opener when they scored 100 points in a loss to Phoenix Grizzlies: Conley converted a 4-point play in the closing seconds of the first half. ... Gasol had eight rebounds in the first quarter. His 15 for the game was a season-high. ... Gasol, who entered the game having made 12 of 25 3-pointers over the last three games, missed all five of his shots from outside the arc. ... Memphis won its 11th game of the season, halfway to last year's total of 22. SEE YOU COME SPRING TIME The two teams will not meet again until March 2 at Dallas. Then the Southwest Division foes will play a back-to-back in April -- in Dallas on April 5 and then in Memphis on April 7. CONLEY SHOOTING Conley, coming off a season where a played only 12 games because of a season-ending heel injury, struggled shooting in the early stages this year as he got back into game shape. He has connected on 50 of 102 shots over his last six games. ""I sure hope you didn't think I was going to shoot like 10 percent for the rest of the year"" Conley said after the game.","401070925"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks have been plagued lately by sluggish first-half performances. They got away with it again Monday night. The Bucks fell behind by 17 points before rallying to down the Denver Nuggets 104-98. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 29 points and Eric Bledsoe added 23, including two late 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo added 12 rebounds for Milwaukee, which came from 22 down in the first half to beat the Chicago Bulls on Friday night. The Bucks also fell behind by double digits in the first quarter in a loss to Memphis on Wednesday. ""We've got to do a better job to try to set the tone,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think we did a better job this game, but we can do a lot better. I think our talent saves us. I feel like we are so talented that even when we are down 10, down 15, we can always get back into the game."" The Bucks swept the two-game season series against the Nuggets for the first time since 2009-10. Jamal Murray had 17 points, eight rebounds and a season-best nine assists for Denver, which has lost six of its last seven games. ""We still have confidence. We just aren't winning games,"" Murray said. Nikola Jokic had 20 points, Gary Harris 14 and Malik Beasley chipped in with a season-high 12 points off the bench. ""I was really pleased with the fight and the competitive spirit. We gave ourselves a chance against a very good basketball team on the road,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""But there are no moral victories. We've got to start winning these games."" The Bucks led 78-77 heading to fourth quarter. The teams exchanged leads until Milwaukee went on a late 8-0 run that featured a pair of 3-pointers by Bledsoe. ""I think Eric is in a really good place,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He is understanding what we need in different moments."" Denver pulled within two points with less than a minute left on Jokic's 3 but Khris Middleton, who had been 0 for 7 from deep, answered with a 3-pointer to put the Bucks up 103-98 with 27 seconds left. After trailing by 10 to start the third quarter, the Bucks grabbed the lead late in the period on a slam dunk by Antetokounmpo. Denver used a 17-4 to start the second quarter to build a 17-point lead and held a 56-46 advantage at the half. Milwaukee closed the half on a 10-3 run. The Nuggets led 29-25 after the first quarter, sparked by nine points from Gary Harris. TIP-INS Nuggets: Shot 6 of 21 from 3-point range in the first half. .With 11 first-half points, Murray was the lone Denver player to reach double figures, although all nine players who saw action scored. ...Malone was whistled for a technical foul in the third quarter after arguing an offensive foul call on Juancho Hernangomez. Bucks: Lopez had seven first-quarter rebounds. He entered the game averaging 3.3 rebounds. .Antetokounmpo and Middleton combined to shoot 1 for 14 from 3-point range. CITY EDITION The Bucks donned their colorful city edition uniforms for the first time this season. The uniforms feature a color scheme inspired by the Robert Indiana-designed court at the MECCA, which served as the Bucks' home until 1988. Milwaukee will wear the uniforms for 12 games this season. LONG-RANGE LOPEZ Brook Lopez, who connected on a career-high eight 3-pointers when the teams met earlier this month, was just 2 of 7 from deep but both turned out to be clutch. Lopez's 3-pointer late in the first half helped fuel a Bucks' rally. His 3 with 2:41 left in the game gave the Bucks a six-point lead. TURNOVER TROUBLES Although Murray nearly recorded his first career triple-double, he also committed five turnovers. ""He did some good things out there for us. For him, the challenge is going to be valuing the basketball,"" Malone said. ""As a starting point guard, you can't have five turnovers.""","401070926"
"NEW ORLEANS --  As a contested layup by Pelicans guard Ian Clark caromed off the rim, Julius Randle barreled into the paint, grabbed the offensive rebound and quickly fired it to the perimeter, where Darius Miller caught it in rhythm and nailed a 3-pointer. It was the kind of effective hustle play that Randle has been providing in bunches lately, just as the Pelicans hoped he would when they acquired him to help fill the void left by DeMarcus Cousins' departure in free agency. Anthony Davis had 29 points and nine rebounds, Randle added 21 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in 25 minutes, and New Orleans won its third straight with a 140-126 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night. ""I was just being aggressive. I was just playing hard. If I make mistakes, I don't really care. I just play through them,"" Randle said. ""When I play with that mindset, without thinking about anything else, I'm successful."" Randle injected the Pelicans with the energy and play-making they needed from their top reserve. He had six of New Orleans' 14 offensive rebounds as New Orleans totaled 21 second-chance points. He also made nine of his 13 shots. Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday said Randle has recently changed games with ""his motor, really. The way he's been decisive offensively. I feel like he's kind of like a bull down there."" The 6-foot-9 Randle is also comfortable starting fast breaks with outlet passes or on the dribble after he comes down with rebounds, and Holiday credited his first-year teammate for making the right plays when he handles or distributes the ball, sets screens and rolls to the hoop. ""He's been doing everything,"" Holiday said. E'Twaun Moore scored 24 points and Holiday 21 for New Orleans, which shot nearly 58 percent (59 of 102). Nikola Mirotic hit three of four 3-point attempts and finished with 13 points, while second-year pro Frank Jackson, who because of injury did not make his debut until this season, scored 12 points DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points and Bryn Forbes added 20 for the Spurs, who defeated Golden State a night earlier but have now lost four of five. Dante Cunningham hit all five 3s he attempted and scored 19 points, but did not score in the second half. Rudy Gay added 17 points. ""As the game went on, their athleticism got to us,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They played really well and were aggressive. They shot it well and they did a good job moving the ball and moving bodies. We just didn't have enough juice."" TIP-INS Spurs: Fell to 2-6 on the road. ... Marco Belinelli and Jakob Poeltl each scored 11, while LaMarcus Aldridge grabbed 10 rebounds. ... Attempted just six 3s in the second half, missing five. ... Committed 15 turnovers that led to 25 Pelicans points. Pelicans: Randle now has six career triple-doubles. ... New Orleans improved to 8-1 at home, including 8-0 when Davis plays. ... Had 34 assists on 59 made field goals. ... Holiday had nine assists but also committed five of New Orleans' 11 turnovers. PIVOTAL RUNS Sharp shooting from deep in the first half helped San Antonio build a 10-point lead. The Spurs hit 10 of their first 14 3-point shots, with Cunningham hitting all five he attempted in front of what used to be his home crowd. When Forbes hit his fourth 3 of the game, San Antonio led 60-51 with 4:28 still left in the second quarter. But Randle's driving layup 10 seconds later marked the beginning of a game-turning 17-5 Pelicans run during the next 3 1/2 minutes. Moore hit a pair of 3s during the spurt, Randle added a follow shot while being fouled and Jackson converted a pair of transition layups, one a reverse as he was fouled. San Antonio was still as close as 83-82 on Gay's fade in the third quarter. But New Orleans responded with seven straight points on Wesley Johnson's wing 3 and consecutive dunks by Davis, and the Pelicans methodically built a double-digit lead that got as large as 20. JACKON'S PROMISE Jackson hasn't always been a regular in New Orleans' rotation this season, but that could change given his recent play. ""It's exciting to see somebody so young come out and have meaningful minutes, be able to hold his own,"" Holiday said. ""I feel like his confidence and the confidence from the coaches grow every single day.""","401070927"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Kings sprinted out to a big lead and used their up-and-down style to put Oklahoma City on its heels. Then they got a big lift from Buddy Hield's perimeter shooting to finish off the Thunder. Dave Joerger also got a bit of love from the Golden1 Center crowd after reports surfaced over the weekend that the Sacramento coach was at odds with management over the direction of the team. Hield made three consecutive 3-pointers late in the fourth quarter and scored 25 points, Marvin Bagley III had his first career double-double and the Kings beat the Thunder 117-113 on Monday night to spoil Russell Westbrook's return. ""We're a hard-playing team and that's what our reputation going around the league is,"" Joerger said. ""In the first half we played maybe as fast as we've played since at Miami (on Oct. 29). We like to play that fast but we got tired. But we kept at it and kept battling."" Iman Shumpert scored 21 of his 23 points in the first half, Bogdan Bogdanovic added 16 points and the Kings beat the Thunder for the second time this season. Bagley, the second overall pick in the draft, had 15 points and 13 rebounds, while De'Aaron Fox had 13 assists. Westbrook had 29 points and 13 assists in his first game back in Billy Donovan's lineup since Nov. 5. The seven-time All-Star had missed five games with a left ankle sprain, then left the team Saturday to welcome the birth of twin daughters that same night. He flew to Sacramento and rejoined the Thunder on Monday morning. ""They were coming at us with their pace and we were kind of always backpedaling,"" Donovan said. ""We were never able to generate any force coming back."" The Kings blew a 19-point lead and were up 98-96 when Hield went on a tear from the perimeter. His first 3 extended the lead to 101-96. After Jerami Grant's floater for the Thunder, Hield made back-to-back shots beyond the arc. Oklahoma City cut the gap to 115-113 on Paul George's fourth 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds remaining. Fox then made a pair of free throws to seal it for Sacramento. ""Right spots, right time,"" Hield said. ""Just trying to pick spots where I could read the defense and the stuff they were giving up."" George added 27 points and nine rebounds. Steven Adams had 11 points and 15 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which had been an NBA-best 10-1 over its previous 11 games. ""We didn't shoot well,"" George said. ""They sped the game up. We were winning at one point and we didn't finish this game out."" Things got chippy early in the third quarter after Willie Cauley-Stein was fouled hard from behind by Westbrook while going for a layup. As he was going out of bounds Cauley-Stein appeared to shove Westbrook, who stumbled back before going after the Kings' 7-foot center. Adams intervened and grabbed Cauley-Stein, who then shoved Adams while the two were underneath the basket. Cauley-Stein and Adams were called for offsetting technical fouls. TIP-INS Thunder: Terrance Ferguson missed his second straight game for personal reasons. No timetable has been given for his return. ... Nerlens Noel sat out with an illness. Kings: Sacramento was held to a season-low 15 points in the third quarter. The previous low was 17 against Miami on Oct. 29. The Kings had 10 assists on 15 buckets in the first quarter. ... Shumpert had 26 points in the Kings' 131-120 win over the Thunder in Oklahoma on Oct. 21. ... Kosta Koufos sat out a fourth consecutive game with right calf soreness. VOCAL SUPPORT Joerger received a standing ovation from the crowd of 16,250 during pregame introductions. Joerger was the subject of a story by Yahoo Sports that suggested the coach was in hot water with Kings management over his handling of the team's younger players, specifically Bagley, who has come off the bench in all 17 games this season. ""I love it here,"" Joerger said. ""Listening to the ovation tonight, that was really cool. I appreciated the pregame.""","401070928"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Danny Green watched helplessly from the paint while Evan Fournier dribbled past and dunked a tying basket with 2.3 seconds left. Feeding off the confidence of first-year coach Nick Nurse, Green got redemption on the very next play. Green made a fade-away jumper with less than a second remaining to lift the Toronto Raptors over the Orlando Magic 93-91 on Tuesday night. He caught Kyle Lowry's inbound pass with 2.3 seconds left, pulled up on the left side of the lane and hit a jumper with 0.5 seconds showing. Orlando's Nikola Vucevic missed on a 67-foot heave as time expired. ""Most coaches wouldn't go to a guy who makes a mistake at that point in the game, but Nick has 100 percent faith in all of us,"" Green said. ""He continues to encourage us and allows us to play through our mistakes. It was nice to make one after missing quite a few the whole game."" Kawhi Leonard led Toronto with 18 points, and Pascal Siakam had 15. Serge Ibaka added 14 points and nine rebounds, and Green finished with 13. Fournier led the Magic with 27 points, 22 of them in the second half when he was about the only offense Orlando could generate. Aaron Gordon had 16 points, and Vucevic had 14 points and 18 rebounds for the Magic, who ended a three-game winning streak. Both sides struggled offensively much of the game, especially the fourth quarter. Toronto committed eight turnovers in the final period, and Orlando missed 11 straight field-goal attempts during a rough 4-minute stretch. Some of that had to do with the defense. ""Our defense was unbelievable the first 24 minutes and the last 12,"" Nurse said. ""We were an absolute disaster in the third quarter, but some of that was our offense's fault."" The Magic outscored the Raptors 38-26 in the third quarter to wipe out what had been an 18-point deficit. Orlando led 77-75 early in the fourth quarter before missing 11 straight field-goal attempts. Its only points during that time were two free throws from Jonathan Isaac. ""The story of the game was the first six minutes of the fourth quarter,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We did a good job fighting at the end and that last shot was a difficult shot and he just knocked it in."" Toronto didn't take much advantage of the drought. The Raptors could only put together a 3-pointer from Green and a layup by Jonas Valanciunas during that stretch to take an 80-77 lead. The teams traded baskets from there until Ibaka drilled a jumper from the top of the key to put Toronto in front 91-89. Toronto led by 18 during a first half when both teams struggled to find or maintain an offensive rhythm. The Raptors made enough shots to jump out to a 40-22 advantage in the middle of the second quarter, as Orlando labored with under 30 percent shooting. Fournier started the second half with a 3-pointer, the first of six 3s in the period for the Magic. Another 3 from Fournier tied it at 59 with 5:05 left, and his free throw gave Orlando a 75-73 lead going into the fourth. Fournier had 14 points in the quarter. VUCEVIC GETTING NOTICED Vucevic is averaging 25.5 points and 11.7 rebounds the past six games, including five Orlando victories. ""He's playing better than I've ever seen him play,"" Nurse said. ""It used to be he'd get 20 and 12 or something and it was like you didn't even notice or it didn't matter. But now, it's in the rhythm of what they're doing. He's got this look on his face that says give me the ball and I'm going to score it."" TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto didn't have a player reach double-figure scoring in the first half. ... Toronto got 17 second-chance points. Magic: Backup F Terrence Ross, the hottest shooter on the Magic over the last five games, was just 2 of 10 against his old team. ... The Magic shot only 41.5 percent for the game.","401070929"
"WASHINGTON --  There has been a lot of negativity around the struggling Washington Wizards in recent days. When they fell behind the Los Angeles Clippers by 24 points midway in the second quarter, the Wizards didn't fall apart again. Instead, they rallied for their biggest win of the season. John Wall scored 30 points, Bradley Beal had 27 and Jeff Green added 20 as Washington wore down the Clippers 125-118 on Tuesday night. Amid a 5-11 start, there were reports the team would listen to trade offers for All-Star guards Wall and Beal, and talk of a nasty practice last week with Wall yelling at coach Scott Brooks and being fined for disrespectful behavior. ""It happened. We talked about it, we moved on,"" Brooks said. ""I'm not here to throw anything in anybody's face."" Wall, Beal and Green each scored 10 in the fourth quarter as Washington outscored Los Angeles 39-23 to pull out the win. ""We've still got a lot of stuff to fix,"" Beal said. ""I'm still not happy. I know everybody's not happy with where we are."" The Wizards cut the Clippers lead to 95-86 after three quarters and took a 115-113 lead on Wall's layup with 2:33 to play. Tobias Harris scored a season-high 29 points, Montrezl Harrell had 20, and Lou Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each added 17 for the Clippers, who had won five straight. Williams was ejected with 34.5 seconds to play. ""You have a team, you can see they're wounded, and I really thought we had a chance to be up 30 at halftime,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""And you can just see it we kind of got the lead, kind of turned down the energy."" TIP INS Clippers: C Luc Mbah a Moute missed his 12th straight game with a sore left knee. ... Rivers said it wasn't a problem to face his son, Austin, who was traded from Los Angeles to Washington in the offseason. ""We should have that one down tonight,"" Rivers said. ""If we mess that one up, I'm going to go off on the whole team.""  The Clippers held Austin Rivers to two points. ... G Tyrone Wallace left the court after a violent collision with Beal late in the third quarter. Wallace held a towel over his left eye as he departed, but Rivers said he had tested negatively for a concussion. Wizards: C Dwight Howard was out with a glute injury. Howard missed the season's first seven games with the injury. Thomas Bryant received his first NBA start and scored seven points in 19 minutes. ... F Kelly Oubre, Jr. started in place of Markieff Morris. It was the first time Morris came off the bench since Feb. 28, 2016. Oubre committed five fouls in 12 minutes. WILLIAMS TOSSED Williams, who Rivers said was subpar because of illness was ejected after being assessed a technical foul. Generally, two technical warrant ejection. ""I felt like we were playing through a lot of contact and I didn't think that Washington was playing through a lot of contact, and I wanted a real answer why that was,"" Williams said. TOUGH WALL Brooks defended Wall from talk that he was soft and slow. ""John, he's been taking hits,"" Brooks said. ""You hear all the reports, he's heavy. He has seven percent body fat.He hasn't played well. None of us have."" Brooks said that Wall suffered a bruised thigh in the season's second game, and played through it for several games. ""He didn't say one word, and I wasn't going to say it,"" Brooks said. Wall had little to say about the tenor of the team after the game. ""It's cool,"" he said. ""It's a good start.""","401070930"
"MIAMI --  The only 3-pointer that the Miami Heat made in the fourth quarter came with just about a minute to go, when Rodney McGruder connected from the right corner. Problem is, he stepped out of bounds first. And that sums up things right now for the Heat. The Brooklyn Nets were more than happy to add to Miami's home woes. D'Angelo Russell scored 20 points, Jarrett Allen had 13 points and 14 rebounds and the Nets prevailed 104-92 on Tuesday night -- handing Miami a fifth consecutive home loss. ""We just played great defense the whole game,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I know it wasn't pretty."" He's right. Then again, the Nets didn't need style points. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 16 points for Brooklyn, which held the Heat to 36 percent shooting. Joe Harris and DeMarre Carroll each added 11 for the Nets and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 10 as Brooklyn avenged a home loss to Miami last week. ""We wanted to be the aggressor,"" Russell said. ""Honestly, we owed them one after they came out and gave it to us last time."" Hassan Whiteside had 21 points and 23 rebounds for Miami. No Heat team has ever had a home losing streak of five or more games and went on to make the playoffs. ""We still believe in ourselves,"" Whiteside said. The Heat couldn't make much of anything all night, especially in the fourth quarter. They were 0 for 7 from 3-point range in the fourth, 7 for 13 from the free-throw stripe in that period -- and were 4 for 19 from the floor overall in those 12 minutes, with the game on the line. And for the game, Miami was just 25 for 60 inside the paint. ""Missed shots, those will happen,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Again, that seemed like we missed quite a few in the paint. We had some point-blank opportunities."" Josh Richardson scored 16 and McGruder finished with 15 for Miami. Justise Winslow added 10 and Dwyane Wade returned from a seven-game absence because of the birth of his daughter to score five points. Miami was leading 42-39 at halftime. To say either team was ""winning"" at that point would be a stretch. It was the lowest-scoring half of the season for each team. The 81 combined points represented the lowest-scoring first half of any NBA game this season, and both teams went into intermission shooting 33 percent. The Heat missed their first eight shots of the game, then opened the second quarter on a 14-0 run while the Nets missed nine consecutive shots. After three minutes of the second quarter, the Heat were shooting 25.7 percent -- which not only had them in the lead, it also outpaced the Nets' 22.2 percent rate to that point. ""You can definitely see guys not playing just free with their game,"" Wade said. ""We're overthinking at times. In this game, you don't want that. You just want to play."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn's first five field-goal attempts were from 3-point range. ... The 13 points allowed by the Nets in the first quarter represented their low for any quarter this season. ... Russell also had nine rebounds and six assists. Heat: Miami was again without Goran Dragic (knee) and didn't have Tyler Johnson, who strained his hamstring in practice Monday. ... Winslow made his first four shots. ... Whiteside got the 10th 20-20 game of his career. CHILLY START The 81 first-half points between the two teams doesn't even beat three separate quarters (Utah 47, Golden State 37; Minnesota 46, Dallas 37; and Golden State 46, Washington 37) in the NBA this season. And Golden State also had a 92-point half by itself against Chicago earlier this season. DINWIDDIE'S KICKS The sneakers that Dinwiddie wore were a tribute to Wade, part of the Nets guard's seasonlong effort to raise money by playing with artwork on his feet. Tuesday's were a tribute to Wade -- with ""One Last Dance"" written across the tongues, as well as a No. 3 and some Miami-themed palm trees. Dinwiddie is auctioning off his game-worn shoes to benefit various charities that support youth causes all season.","401070931"
"NEW YORK --  The bad beginning to the road trip is behind them and the Trail Blazers are ready for the rest. Even if Milwaukee and Golden State are two of the toughest stops on the NBA schedule. ""Now we got the back end of it, against two of the best teams on their home floor,"" Damian Lillard said. ""Good challenge, good test for us."" CJ McCollum scored 31 points, Lillard had 29 points, eight assists and six rebounds, and Portland beat the New York Knicks 118-114 on Tuesday night. Jusuf Nurkic finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Blazers, who have won two straight after dropping the first two games on their trip that now heads to its difficult conclusion. Portland plays Milwaukee on Wednesday and closes it at Golden State on Friday. Both teams are 8-1 at home. Portland's star guards provided most of the offense in a game that was close most of the way, and Evan Turner helped the Trail Blazers finally pull it out when he put back a missed shot with Portland clinging to a two-point lead and 9.5 seconds remaining. ""Evan's tip at the end was big time,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""They defended Damian well on the shot. It was a hell of a play, especially with the bodies that were down there."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 32 points for the Knicks, who dropped their sixth straight. They were a bit better than the previous games of the skid, when they yielded 126.2 points per game, but not good enough to stop the early Western Conference leaders at 12-5. ""I've been through a lot of losing streaks. The most important thing is not to fall apart. Stay together and keep fighting,"" Knicks center Enes Kanter said. ""Don't make any excuses. If you're going to lose a game, just make them feel us first."" Hardaway has scored 30 or more points in three straight games. The Knicks changed lineups again, going back to veteran Kanter over rookie Mitchell Robinson at center, and got off to a good start. The Knicks' lead was 35-33 after Nik Stauskas threw in a 40-footer to beat the first-quarter buzzer. New York opened a 10-point lead early in the third, and that seemed to wake up the Blazers, who outscored the Knicks 24-10 to end the period and take an 89-85 lead to the fourth. The Blazers then opened the fourth with a quick 7-2 spurt, and McCollum had eight straight Portland points as the Blazers took their biggest lead at 104-93 with 7:45 to play. ""Finishing is our No. 1 priority right now,"" Knicks guard Trey Burke said. ""We're playing teams all the way down to the wire and we're coming up short and that's been the ongoing story all year."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Nurkic had his career-best fifth straight double-double. ... Portland, which came in shooting an NBA-best 85.4 percent on free throws, was just 12 of 17 (70.6 percent). Knicks: Mario Hezonja made his first start of the season, scoring two points. Only Ron Baker and Luke Kornet haven't made at least one start. ... Burke scored 19 points and Emmanual Mudiay, who has supplanted him as the starting point guard, had 16. CHANGING IT UP Knicks coach David Fizdale said he changed back to Kanter because the 20-year-old Robinson was getting in early foul trouble and having to come out of the games too quickly, affecting the rotations. He said that wouldn't be as much of a problem with Robinson in a reserve role. PIONEER REMEMBERED The Knicks held a pregame moment of silence for John Rucker, a former New York police officer who died recently. Rucker was invited to training camp in 1950 and became the first African-American to wear a Knicks uniform.","401070932"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  The Indiana Pacers paid so much attention to Kemba Walker on Wednesday night they seemed to forget about the rest of the Charlotte Hornets. Walker drew plenty of attention from the Pacers defense in the pick-and-roll after his recent scoring outburst, which allowed his teammates to get open looks from 3-point range. The NBA's leading scorer going into the game finished with 16 points and a season-high 11 assists as the Hornets defeated the Pacers 127-109. Walker had scored 103 points in his previous two games, including 60 against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. But the two-time All-Star only attempted 10 shots against the Pacers. ""About time he decided to start passing the ball,"" joked Hornets coach James Borrego, who has encouraged Walker to shoot as much as he can this season. Borrego said the Hornets offense starts with Walker. ""He generates so much for us,"" Borrego said. ""I think this is where we have to go as a team right now. The more teams want to put pressure on him, put two guys on the ball, you see what we can accomplish without Kemba having to go for big numbers."" Jeremy Lamb was one the beneficiaries of the open looks, scoring 21 points on a career-high five 3-pointers. He also attacked the rim well. ""Kemba can facilitate, he can score, he can do whatever he wants on the court,"" Lamb said. ""Today he facilitated and we were able to knock down some shots."" Charlotte shot 62 percent from 3-point range, making a season-high 18 of 29 shots from beyond the arc. ""Whatever the defense give me, I'm trying to take advantage of that and tonight when they were up in the pick-and-rolls I was just getting rid of the basketball and my teammates were just making shots,"" Walker said. Said Borrego: ""Teams will have to decide how they want to play us with Kemba. But no matter what they do, I trust our guys are getting better and understanding spacing."" Dwayne Bacon had 18 and Cody Zeller 15 for the Hornets, who improved to 6-3 at home. Bojan Bogdanovic had 20 points for the Pacers, who played for a second straight game without Victor Oladipo, who remains out with a sore right knee. Indiana had its three-game winning streak halted. ""Walker did a good job of scoring when he had opportunities but setting his teammates up and they were knocking down shots,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Just couldn't get stops tonight. Sometimes that happens."" TIP INS: Pacers: Domantas Sabonis was 7 of 7 for 15 points before rolling his ankle midway through the second quarter. He returned in the second half, but never scored again and fouled out with 6 minutes left. Hornets: Marvin Williams was taken to the locker room in the third quarter with a face contusion and a bloody nose after taking a knee to the head from Young while on the floor. He returned to the bench, but did not play. ... Malik Monk broke out of a 0-for-14 slump from beyond the arc by making 3 of 6 3-pointers. KAMINSKY SEES ACTION Frank Kaminsky had 11 points off the bench, which was more than he had scored all season (nine). Borrego praise Kaminsky for having a ""fantastic"" attitude and continuing to work hard, even though he had only played a limited role in five games this season after being a role player last year under coach Steve Clifford. ""I didn't know when the opportunity was going to come,"" Kaminsky said. ""Obviously with Willy being hurt wasn't how I wanted it to happen. But coach has told me all season so far just to stay ready, be ready for whatever comes and then when you get the opportunity you've got to be ready to take it. I was just really excited that I got that chance tonight."" BRIDGING THE GAP Rookie Miles Bridges had a nice stretch late in the third quarter to help push Charlotte's lead to 21 points. He knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers and then rejected shots by Thaddeus Young and Cory Joseph seconds later.","401070933"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid is on a mission to win the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards. If he keeps up this pace, he'll make it easy on voters. Embiid had 31 points and 19 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 121-120 on Wednesday night after Anthony Davis missed the third of three free throws with 2.5 seconds left. Embiid reached at least 30 points and 15 rebounds for the 12th time this season. He was serenaded frequently with loud chants of ""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" from the raucous home crowd. ""If we win 50 to 55 games and have these numbers, I think I have a pretty good chance,"" Embiid said. Davis had 12 points and 16 rebounds in a showdown between two of the NBA's top big men. Davis entered averaging 27.6 points per game, just below Embiid's 27.9. The Pelicans center was coming off an impressive 29-point, nine-rebound outing in New Orleans' 140-126 victory over San Antonio on Monday. But, like most of the rest of the league this season, he was no match for Embiid. ""The reality of how important he is to our team is ever-present,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""How can we all not notice how dominant he's been?"" Embiid had his way with New Orleans, finishing 11 of 23 from the field and 7 of 9 from the free-throw line. He also was 2 of 4 from beyond the arc. With his strength and size inside, as well as ability to shoot from outside, Embiid has been nearly impossible to guard this season. He has double-doubles in 18 of Philadelphia's 20 games, leading the NBA. ""As stupid as it sounds, we did a pretty good job on him,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""That's a hell of a compliment to him to say we did a good job."" The 76ers are 10-0 at home this season. They looked in control, up nine points with just under 2  1/2 minutes to play, before a late surge by the Pelicans. Embiid fouled Davis on a 3-point attempt, and Davis calmly swished the first two free throws before the third went in and out. Davis grabbed the rebound, but his wild attempt at a winning shot was off the mark. Ben Simmons added 22 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the 76ers, who won their fourth straight. Philadelphia is the lone team in the NBA undefeated at home. The Pelicans had won three in a row and six of seven. E'Twaun Moore and Jrue Holiday led New Orleans with 30 points apiece, and Julius Randle had 22 points and 10 rebounds. The 76ers were seemingly in control when Wilson Chandler hit a 3-pointer to make it 119-110 with 2:24 left. But consecutive 3-pointers by Moore and Nikola Mirotic pulled the Pelicans within 119-118 with 1:08 left. J.J. Redick, enduring a rare cold shooting night, scored on a drive with 53.2 seconds to play to put Philadelphia ahead three. Davis misfired on a 3, but Philadelphia's lead remained 121-118 after Simmons missed a 10-foot jumper to set up the game-deciding sequence. HOME SWEET HOME The 76ers have a long way to go to get anywhere close to the 1985-86 Celtics, who hold the NBA home regular-season record of 40-1. But Philadelphia clearly is stamping out its home court as a tough place for opponents. ""There's pride and we don't want to let anyone down here,"" Simmons said. AS FULTZ TURNS Philadelphia played without guard Markelle Fultz. The 2017 No. 1 overall pick was on the bench but not in uniform after his agent informed the team Tuesday that Fultz would not practice or play with the team until consulting a specialist for his right shoulder. The demand from Fultz's representative came a day after the guard was benched for T.J. McConnell in the second half of Philadelphia's 119-114 win over the Suns on Monday. Fultz played just 14 games last season due to a shoulder injury that may or may not have affected his shot, which has become one of the most scrutinized in the NBA. The 20-year-old is averaging 8.2 points and 3.1 assists in 23 minutes per game this season shooting just 42 percent from the field. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis reached 10,000 career points with a dunk late in the first half. ... New Orleans dropped to 2-7 on the road. The Pelicans will play their next two away from home, at the Knicks on Friday and at Washington on Saturday. .. G Elfrid Payton had successful surgery Tuesday on the little finger on his left hand, the team said. He is expected back in six weeks. 76ers: Embiid chided McConnell for missing a layup in the first half and McConnell shot back, ""So what!"" ... Jimmy Butler had 13 points in his fifth game with the 76ers. ... Redick, normally a sharpshooter, missed all seven of his 3-point attempts.","401070934"
"ATLANTA --  Vince Carter grabbed his career milestone with a last-second dunk -- long after his first NBA team had the victory secured. Kyle Lowry scored 21 points during his first triple-double of the season and the Toronto Raptors never trailed while beating the reeling Atlanta Hawks 124-108 on Wednesday night. The night's final bow belonged to Carter, whose jam with less than a second remaining pushed him past 25,000 career points. He became the 22nd NBA player to reach the milestone and then tossed some love toward the Raptors. ""I'm very thankful for every team that I've played for,"" Carter said. ""... But there's nothing like your first."" Carter, who played his first seven seasons with Toronto, began the night 13 points shy of the mark. The Hawks were pulling for Carter, in his 21st season, to reach the milestone against his former team. After the game, Carter's teammates were like fans looking for souvenirs. ""All the guys tried to take everything I own,"" Carter said. ""All my backup shoes are gone now."" Carter, 41, didn't seem to mind. ""I still love it,"" he said. ""I still love playing. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do it."" Carter sank a 3-pointer with less than two minutes remaining and, clearly aiming for the milestone, missed two more 3s before being fouled with 33.9 seconds remaining. Carter pulled with one point of 25,000 when he sank two free throws after a video review overruled the original call he was fouled on a 3-pointer. On Atlanta's final possession, he missed a jumper before rookie Kevin Huerter grabbed the rebound and passed back to Carter, setting up the buzzer-beating jam. Carter's 14 points gave him 25,001 for his career. Players from both teams hugged Carter at midcourt. ""He earned it,"" Lowry said. ""It's awesome to do it against the team he started with."" Added Toronto's Fred VanVleet: ""Vince has changed the game for every kid growing up."" Lowry had 17 assists and 12 rebounds for his 13th career triple-double. Jonas Valanciunas had season-high totals of 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Raptors (15-4). ""That was kind of fun,"" Valanciunas said before giving credit to Lowry. ""It's easy to play with this kind of point guard."" Pascal Siakam had 22 points. Jeremy Lin scored 26 points off the bench for the Hawks (3-15), who have lost nine straight since their last win against Miami on Nov. 3. Atlanta's only starter to score in double figures was Taurean Prince with 12 points. The teams combined to miss 14 straight shots from the field to open the game before Lowry finally sank a jumper. He followed up with a 3-pointer, and the Raptors never lost the lead. The Raptors led 55-44 at halftime. Toronto stretched the lead to 20 points for the first time at 100-80 on Danny Green's 3-pointer midway through the final period. Carter's milestone was popular with players for both teams. ""I would love for him to do it tonight but Vince is going to play the game the right way and do what he's supposed to do and he's going to worry about that as it happens,"" said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce before the game. ""... I know this is his former team. I know it would have another added boost to it, being against Toronto, adding a milestone that is a great accomplishment and a testament to his 21 years."" TIP-INS Raptors: OG Anunoby (sprained right wrist) and C.J. Miles (right adductor strain) did not play. ... The Raptors improved to 8-2 on the road. Hawks: Alex Len (sore back) and Omari Spellman (right hip adductor) did not play. ... Atlanta's bench outscored the starters 16-8 in the first period and 72-36 for the game. ""We just struggled,"" said Pierce of the starters. ""We just needed to get some new life, new energy."" REST FOR LEONARD The Raptors rested top scorer Kawhi Leonard on the second day of back-to-back games. That has been the standard practice with Leonard, but coach Nick Nurse said ""we're getting closer"" to Leonard playing in consecutive days. NO FOUL Lowry left the game with a bloody nose with 4:09 remaining. No foul was called, despite his protests to officials as he held a towel to his face. He returned to the game.","401070935"
"BOSTON -- Coach Brad Stevens knows what is wrong with the Celtics. Plenty. Trey Burke scored 29 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. had 21, and the New York Knicks snapped a six-game losing streak with a 117-109 victory over the surprisingly inconsistent Celtics on Wednesday night. Noah Vonleh had 16 points and Enes Kanter finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds for New York, which won for the fifth time in 19 games. ""This is a lot of things,"" Stevens said. ""We have a myriad of issues we have to fix."" Kyrie Irving led the Celtics with 22 points and 13 assists, Marcus Morris had 21 points, and Al Horford and Gordon Hayward each added 19 points. It was a season-high third straight loss for Boston, which slipped to 9-9. Pegged as an Eastern Conference favorite after losing in the conference finals last season, Boston currently looks like a team that has lost its cohesiveness. The Celtics have a healthy Irving and Hayward, who were injured and missed the playoffs, but they look nothing like last season's team. ""We're not playing with the same personality that we did last year, and that's the easy way to describe it, and the 50,000 issues are below that,"" Stevens said. ""I just don't know that we're that good. Maybe it's not a wake-up call if you keep getting beat."" Boston cut its deficit to 110-106 on a 3-pointer by Hayward, but Burke hit a jumper with 50 seconds to play. Burke added a 3-pointer to make it 115-109 with 12 seconds left. Mitchell Robinson's basket with just under five minutes to play pushed New York ahead 103-87 and sent a good number of fans to the exits, some of whom voiced their displeasure before leaving by booing. ""In order to be considered a special team, you have to earn it,"" Irving said. Hardaway felt the Knicks have something to build on. ""We're 5-14. We've still got a lot of learning to do,"" he said. ""We'll go and look at film on Friday. But everybody should go home with a smile on their face and eat good tomorrow, you know, because we got a win."" Leading by 16 at the half, the Knicks had their lead cut to 10 four times in the third quarter, but Boston was unable to reduce it to single digits. ""Effort. They stuck with it. Young fellas on a back-to-back, in a hostile environment,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Just played extremely hard and played through a lot of adversity. Thank goodness that clock ran out."" The Celtics started hearing boos from the home crowd midway through the second quarter. The boos became louder when they fell behind by 20 points, 46-26. ""Tomorrow might be a good day for us to reflect a little bit,"" Hayward said. New York built its lead to 57-31 on Kanter's reverse layup before heading to the locker room with a 65-49 halftime edge. TIP-INS Knicks: Fizdale started Emmanuel Mudiay and Hardaway in the backcourt, saying: ""They're starting to play with some good chemistry. I'm happy with the pace."" ... They shot 65 percent (15-of-23) in the second quarter. Celtics: Horford started after he was listed as probable because of a sore left knee. He went to the locker room briefly in the second quarter. ... Boston missed its initial 10 3-point attempts and 14 of its first 15. STAYING THE SAME Fizdale decided to use the same starting lineup as Tuesday night, because his team ""got off to a good start"" despite a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers at Madison Square Garden. New York got off to a quick start again Wednesday, opening a 25-14 lead late in the opening quarter. GOTTA GO Stevens was asked about the play of two of his players before the game and turned it into how his team needs to improve and play more consistently. ""It's not about what you do on one day right now,"" he said. ""It's about how can you piece things together and go and go and go and go. As a team, that's what we're all searching for.""","401070936"
"Tristian Thompson ""feels blessed"" to be a part of history with LeBron James in Cleveland and expects the fans to cheer for him. (1:16) CLEVELAND --  Once the video tribute ended, a simple sentiment filled the giant scoreboard. Against a black backdrop, giant white letters delivered the heartfelt message. Cleveland wanted to say something. ""THANK YOU, LeBRON,"" it said. Eight years after he was treated like a thug, LeBron James was welcomed back properly. Back on the court where he performed for 11 seasons, and under the title banner he helped raise, James returned to Cleveland and rallied the Los Angeles Lakers to a 109-105 win on Wednesday night over the Cavaliers, who played their best game of the season against their former teammate but couldn't stop him when it mattered most. James finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. He also scored or assisted on 11 straight points as the Lakers overcame a 99-91 deficit in the fourth quarter. But basketball took a backseat to James' homecoming, which was so different than his return in 2010, when betrayed Cleveland fans unleashed their fury on him. There were no profane chants this time. No derogatory signs. No venom. Only love, and James felt it. ""From the time we landed yesterday, it just felt a different way,"" he said. ""I'm a different person. We're all different from eight years ago, both good and bad. But more importantly, this experience has been great. So it's all about growth and we all have grown from that moment eight years ago. So I kind of leave the past in the past and always focus on the present and see what happens in the future."" The Cavs, who came in a league-worst 2-13, gave James and the Lakers all they could handle. And even after giving up an eight-point lead, they had a chance to tie late, but Kyle Korver missed a wide-open 3-pointer with 17 seconds left and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made four free throws in the final 15 to seal it for Los Angeles. Jordan Clarkson had 20 points and Tristan Thompson 14 and 15 rebounds for Cleveland. From the moment he stepped back onto Quicken Loans Arena floor, James was treated like a returning champion. On the night before Thanksgiving, Cleveland said thanks to the Northeast Ohio son, the one who ended the city's 52-year championship drought. ""A hero has come back,"" Cavs coach Larry Drew said before tip-off. James was the last Lakers player introduced before the game, presented with a line familiar to all Cavs fans: ""A 6-foot-8 forward from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School,"" said arena announcer Sean Peebles. ""Welcome home! LeBron James."" The crowd roared and stood as James walked out and huddled with his new teammates, who must have wondered what was in store for them. But unlike that ugly night of Dec. 2, 2010, when James returned with the Miami Heat and was subjected to a toxic, charged atmosphere of hatred unlike anything seen before or since, this was a night for celebration -- and maybe more closure. James has moved on. Cleveland, too. With 8:09 left in the first quarter, James was saluted by the Cavs with a moving video tribute during a timeout. Images of James' playing days with Cleveland -- highlighted by the Cavs' historic comeback to win the 2016 title -- were shown along with video clips of his impact on the community, including his opening of the I Promise School in his hometown of Akron. James was touched by the presentation. He bit his lower lip while walking back onto court and pointed to all corners of the building in appreciation, his chance to reconnect with a fan base he'll always share a special, if not complicated, relationship. ""I appreciate these fans, just as much as they appreciate me,"" he said. ""Every single night we stepped on the floor, they always showed their appreciation to not only myself but to my teammates over these 11 years, especially the last four years -those championship runs that we were making. So that was just my salute to them for them appreciating what I was able to accomplish with my teammates and coaches along those four years."" TIP-INS Lakers: Coach Luke Walton is impressed with James' knack for blocking out external distractions. ""The great ones have that ability,"" he said. ""When they're on the basketball court nothing else matters, other than what they're trying to do. Their focus level seems to somehow get higher with the louder the noise gets. I don't know how. I don't know why."" Cavaliers: Did not commit a turnover in the first half. ... Starting G George Hill missed his sixth straight game with a sprained right shoulder sustained on Nov. 4. Hill has ramped up his on-court workouts in recent days and could be back soon. ... Drew said he was unaware of Smith's comments accusing the Cavs of ""tanking."" Drew believes his team is playing hard, and promised to nothing but coach his team to win. ""To coach to lose, I don't understand that, I don't know how to do that,"" he said. ""I don't know how anybody can do that. That's something I would never, ever do."" SCHOOL DAY Earlier in the day, James made a surprise visit to his I Promise School, a refurbished elementary for at-risk kids he founded and plans to expand. ""It was grandparent's day,"" he said. ""We kept it that way, we didn't tell none of the kids until I actually walked into all six of the classrooms individually, spent a good amount of time with those classrooms, my third and fourth graders. It was great. It was a good way to go into Thanksgiving, all of being thankful, the great lives they've had."" HOME COOKING Following the game, the Lakers feasted on hamburgers, french fries and shakes from Swenson's, an Akron drive-in restaurant favored by James. Sitting at his locker, James sipped on a banana shake and smiled. ""I'm good,"" he said. ""I got my hometown food.""","401070937"
"CHICAGO --  Jabari Parker and the Chicago Bulls pushed the ball whenever they had the chance. They stayed focused when the Phoenix Suns made a big play. A couple of solid practices really paid off. Parker had 20 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, and the Bulls beat the Suns 124-116 on Wednesday night to stop a four-game slide. Chicago shot a season-high 56.8 percent from the field and placed six players in double figures in just its third win in its last 12 games. Following an ugly 122-83 home loss to Toronto on Saturday night, Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg worked on pushing the pace in practice, and his team responded with one of its best offensive performances. ""I thought our outlet passes were crisp,"" Hoiberg said. ""I thought they were up the floor, and I thought our guys did a good job of getting down quickly. We didn't hang our heads. We had a couple answer-back plays after they scored where we scored on the other end, and those are important. Those are big plays. We need all those points."" Getting Zach LaVine back helped. LaVine scored 29 points after missing the Raptors loss with an illness, and Ryan Arcidiacono, Wendell Carter Jr. and Antonio Blakeney each had 14 points for Chicago. Phoenix lost for the seventh time in its last eight games. Devin Booker scored 23 points, T.J. Warren had 21 and Deandre Ayton added 18 points and 12 rebounds. ""We had no force, no energy, no effort,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""They wanted this win more, and they got it."" Parker was 6 for 10 from the field in perhaps his best game since signing with his hometown team in the offseason. He also had two steals. ""Winning always solves everything,"" Parker said. ""I just want to do what I can to win and hopefully that kind of snowballs."" Jamal Crawford's pullup jumper for the Suns tied it at 97 with 10:54 left, but the Bulls responded with a 10-0 run. Parker had a driving dunk before Blakeney capped the decisive sequence with a jumper with 7:27 remaining. Phoenix pulled within three on Warren's 3-pointer with 1:27 to go, but Arcidiacono found Carter for a layup and LaVine made two foul shots to help close it out. ""They really got their confidence, got in their rhythm, got their flow and got easy baskets,"" Crawford said. ""Whenever you give a team, especially at home, easy baskets, it settles them in and gives them their confidence."" OOPS The Suns led by as many as nine in the third quarter, and Kokoskov felt his team relaxed at that point. ""We thought the game was over, and that's what happens with an inexperienced team,"" he said. ""They knew there was the rest of the game, and they never quit. That early lead gave us a lackadaisical mindset thinking we can go through this game scoring every time we want. We forgot to play defense."" LOOK OUT Arcidiacono gave Chicago a spark when he jumped over Phoenix's bench while trying to save a ball from going out of bounds in the first quarter. He landed on a couple of fans in the front row, causing a man to lose some of his beer, but everyone was OK. TIP-INS Suns: Crawford had a season-high 16 points against his first NBA team. ... It was Ayton's 10th double-double of his rookie season. ... Phoenix shot 49 percent from the field. Bulls: Justin Holiday made three of the Bulls' 11 3-pointers and finished with 11 points. ... Chicago improved to 1-6 against Western Conference teams. ... Rookie F Chandler Hutchison was held out after he developed back spasms during the morning shootaround. ... F Lauri Markkanen (right elbow sprain) had ""his best conditioning workout"" on Wednesday, Hoiberg said. Markkanen and G Kris Dunn (left MCL sprain) participated in a pick-and-roll drill in practice. ""We did have our guys out there. It wasn't a contact drill,"" Hoiberg said, ""but just to try to get them integrated into a 5-on-5 setting.""","401070938"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets are on a roll, putting their terrible start behind them. James Harden scored a season-high 43 points and Clint Capela added 27 to help Houston withstand a late run by the Pistons and get their fifth straight victory, 126-124. The Rockets have won eight of 10 to improve to 9-7. They led by 14 with about five minutes left, but Blake Griffin made five 3-pointers that helped Detroit cut the lead to four points with about 90 seconds left. Houston struggled to contain Griffin late after defensive stopper P.J. Tucker was ejected in the third quarter after he received two technical fouls for arguing with officials. ""With P.J. getting kicked out of the game early it put more minutes on our guys,"" Harden said. ""But we found a way to win. There's going to be games like that where you've got to figure it out."" Griffin had a turnover and a charge after his fifth 3 and Harden, who made all 19 of his free throw attempts, made two free throws to make it 122-116 with 19.1 seconds left. Ish Smith added a 3-pointer to cut the lead to three points with 9.6 seconds left, but Harden made two more free throws. Griffin was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 3.6 seconds remaining and made the first two free throws before missing the third. It was Harden at the line again after that, and he made both shots before Smith made a 3 at the buzzer. ""It was big,"" Chris Paul said. ""It was good for us. Blake got hot down the stretch ... but for us as we keep saying it's just about piling up wins."" Griffin led the Pistons with 37 points and 11 rebounds Andre Drummond added 20 points with 11 rebounds for the Pistons. ""At the end of the game, two turnovers down the stretch killed us,"" Griffin said. ""It doesn't matter how many points you score ... in the big moments, that's where I have to be better."" Detroit used a run to cut Houston's lead to six points with about six minutes left before the Rockets scored the next eight points, with six from Harden to make it 113-99 about a minute later. But Griffin made three 3-pointers, with the first two on consecutive possessions, to fuel a 9-2 run that got Detroit to 115-108 with 3 1/2 minutes left. James Ennis made a 3-pointer for Houston after that, but Griffin scored the next five points, with another 3-pointer to cut the lead to 118-113 with about two minutes left. Harden added a basket on a goaltending call, but Griffin made yet another 3 to make it 120-116 before his late errors. The Rockets scored the first seven points of the third quarter to make it make it 65-57. But Detroit scored the next eight points, with 3s by Reggie Jackson and Langston Galloway to tie it a couple of minutes later. Houston went on another run after that, outscoring Detroit 9-2, to take a 76-67 lead midway through the quarter. Harden got the Rockets going in that span with a 3-pointer and Capela capped it with four straight points. The Rockets were up 81-73 later in the third when Tucker got hit by Griffin on a screen and began complaining to an official. He received a technical foul, but that didn't stop him from continuing to get in the officials' face and yell at him, drawing a second technical and an ejection. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit made 16 3-pointers to give the team at least 10 in seven straight games, a franchise record. ... Luke Kennard missed his 11th game with a sprained right shoulder and coach Dwane Casey said that he hasn't been cleared for contact drills and will still be out for a while. Rockets: Capela received a technical foul in the third quarter for hanging on the rim after a dunk. ... Chris Paul added 20 points with seven assists. TUCKER'S EJECTION Crew chief Courtney Kirkland on what led to Tucker's ejection: ""The first technical foul was assessed to Tucker for his use of profanity toward Ben Taylor. He walked to him aggressively; Taylor assessed the first technical foul. He stayed there patiently and then Tucker continued to use progressive profanity toward him in a very aggressive manner. That's what the two technical fouls were for."" HARDEN'S MILESTONE Harden's performance on Wednesday night gave him 13,391 career points with the Rockets to move him past Rudy Tomjanovich and into third place on the team's all-time scoring list. Harden was pleased to move up the list but knows taking first place from Hakeem Olajuwon, who is Houston's all-time leading scorer with 26,511 points, will be a huge task. ""We all know how great he was in the league and for this team as well,"" Harden said of Tomjanovich. ""So, it's an honor, but I've got a long way to go to catch Dream.""","401070939"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo figured the Portland Trail Blazers might be tired on the second night of a back-to-back. He was right. Antetokounmpo matched his season high with 33 points and finished an assist short of a triple-double in three quarters as the Milwaukee Bucks defeated Portland 143-100 on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo added 16 rebounds and nine assists in 30 minutes as the Bucks avenged an early season loss to Portland in a rematch of teams off to fast starts. ""We did the job tonight setting the tone for the entire team,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We know they were coming off a back-to-back, so we wanted to come out with energy and get an early lead."" Milwaukee, which lost at Portland 118-103 on Nov. 6, led the entire way and picked up its 13th win in 17 games. The Blazers were coming off a 118-114 victory Tuesday night in New York against the Knicks. CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard each had 22 points for the Trail Blazers, who entered with the best record in the Western Conference and slipped to 12-6. ""We're professionals,"" Lillard said. ""We're not the first team on a trip like this and it's not our first time. We aren't going to lean on that and make an excuse about being tired. It's early in the season. We haven't even played 20 games yet. There were a lot of things that we could've done to be much better, whether we were tired or not."" Milwaukee led 31-20 after one quarter and extended it to 72-50 at the half. The Bucks led 109-79 entering the final period. The 43-point margin of victory was the Bucks' largest since defeating Charlotte by 50 point, 137-87, on Jan. 10, 2000. Khris Middleton had 21 points and Malcom Brogdon and Eric Bledsoe added 16 points apiece for the Bucks, who outrebounded Portland 59-39. The Bucks gained control early, scoring the first six points en route to a 26-7 lead. Portland trimmed the lead to 31-20, but the Bucks used a 9-0 run to boost the advantage to 53-32 with 4:56 left in the half. Antetokounmpo, who had 25 first-half points on 11-of-14 shooting, sandwiched a pair of baskets around a Portland turnover in the final 2.9 seconds to put the Bucks up 72-50 at the break. ""We just came out and played hard,"" Brogdon said. ""That was a very good team tonight. We caught them back-to-back, so I'm guessing they were a little bit tired. I thought we took advantage of that and we executed at a high level."" TIP-INS Trailblazers: Coach Terry Stotts was denied his 400th career victory.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Paul Millsap left the game to get stitches, then came back in time to help the Denver Nuggets stop the bleeding and get a big win. Millsap had 25 points, five rebounds and five steals, Jamal Murray added 18 and the Nuggets had a 35-point third quarter in a 103-101 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves  on Wednesday night. Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 22 points, and Derrick Rose added 20 off the bench. The Timberwolves outscored Denver in three of the four quarters, but still lost their second straight. The Nuggets, who had lost six of seven after starting the year 9-1, trailed 56-50 at the half. That's when coach Mike Malone let his team know in no uncertain terms that their effort was not going to cut it. ""I challenged our guys at halftime. Going in, we talked about how we all need to do more, and at halftime I told them, `We're not doing enough,"" Malone said. ""I don't see the urgency that we need to get a win on the road against a division opponent, and the way we responded in that third quarter I thought was phenomenal."" Denver clamped down defensively, holding Minnesota to 5-for-19 shooting and forcing seven turnovers in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Millsap and Murray combined for 23 points, four steals and two blocks as the Nuggets outscored the Wolves 35-18 in the quarter. ""We just played free. Everybody played in attack mode,"" guard Monte Morris said. ""Our players who need to make plays down the stretch went out and did that."" Millsap started the pivotal third quarter with five points in a quick 7-0 run that put Denver on top 57-56. He then scored on a fast break, connected on a jumper and hit a 3-pointer to push his shooting totals to 10-for-11 on the night. But Millsap's scoring binge was interrupted when he hit the floor hard in a collision with Towns midway through the third quarter. He went to the locker room holding a towel to his head and received stitches for a facial laceration. Murray picked up where Millsap left off, hitting his second and third 3-pointers of the quarter and dropping in a floater to push Denver's lead to 80-67. Millsap returned with 7:02 to play in the fourth quarter and played the rest of the way, helping Denver hang on after a 12-0 Minnesota run all but erased its lead. His floater from the baseline gave the Nuggets a 101-95 lead with less than two minutes to play. ""He's a tough cat. I'm sure he's going to have a nice headache in the morning,"" Malone said. ""But he's a pro -- he came back in and wanted to get right back in the game and helped us pull out this victory."" Minnesota trailed 89-76 early in the fourth quarter when its bench triggered a 12-0 run to make it a game again. Rose hit four free throws and a 3-pointer and Dario Saric added five points in the run. ""We were searching,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I thought they gave us a lift, got us back. The third quarter was a big problem. The bench put us in position to have a chance to win."" Gary Harris ended Minnesota's run with a 3-pointer and added two more driving baskets to help Denver maintain its lead. DOING IT ALL Nikola Jokic and LeBron James are the only two NBA players to lead their teams in points, rebounds, assists and steals. On Wednesday, Jokic showed that he can help his team even on a night when his shots weren't dropping.

"DALLAS --  Devin Harris didn't return to the game when the Dallas guard was replaced shortly after scoring eight straight points to break a fourth-quarter tie. It might have had something to do with him getting two of his game-high four steals in the same span. Harrison Barnes scored a season-high 28 points, Harris did the same with 18 -- sparked by his energetic surge -- and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Brooklyn Nets 119-113 on Wednesday night. ""He was absolutely gassed by the time he came out,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I suppose we could have gone back to him in the fourth, but felt that it we could avoid it, it would be best."" Harris, in his sixth game back after missing 10 with a left hamstring strain, made two free throws to put Dallas ahead for good early in the fourth and got a steal that led to another free throw before hitting a 3-pointer . After another steal, Harris hit a bank shot in the lane for a 95-87 Dallas lead. Those eight points alone were more than Harris scored in any of his six previous games. ""He's been awesome since he came back,"" said guard J.J. Barea, who also had 18 points and added seven assists. ""Smart player, defensively, offensively. He really had a great game tonight. And we needed it from the bench."" Teenage rookie Luka Doncic had 21 points and nine rebounds as the Mavericks won their fifth consecutive home game. They kept the Nets from winning straight three straight on the road for the first time since late in the 2014-15 season, a night after a 12-point win in Miami. Allen Crabbe scored a season-high 27 points for the Nets, including consecutive 3-pointers followed by an assist on a dunk for Jarrett Allen on an 8-0 run that got Brooklyn within two with four minutes remaining. Crabbe was 10 of 16 from the field, including 7 of 11 behind the arc . The sixth-year guard came in shooting 27 percent. ""This has been a struggle,"" Crabbe said. ""The first 18 games, and in those 18 I think I was solid in two of those like tonight. So it feels good man. Like I told you guys the other night, shooter's gotta shoot. It'll click."" Barnes, who was 5 of 8 from long range, answered the Crabbe-led run with a 3 to help the Mavericks get the lead back to nine with less than a minute to go. Dallas won for the fifth time in six games on a night when Dirk Nowitzki was presented a key to the city by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings at halftime. The German star is still waiting to start a record 21st season with the same franchise because of a longer-than-expected recovery from left ankle surgery seven months ago.

Atkinson also played for Braunschweig, and said he faced Nowitzki's Wurzburg team. ""He dropped 30 on us. He was 18 of 19,"" Atkinson said. Early the next morning, Atkinson said, he went to the gym to lift weights and Nowitzki was already there with longtime personal coach Holger Geschwindner. ""Right then, you're like, `This guy's special,"" said the 51-year-old Atkinson, who is in his third season with Brooklyn. SIXTH MAN PLUG Before the game, Carlisle suggested Brooklyn's Spencer Dinwiddie would be a strong candidate for sixth man of the year. Then Dinwiddie went out and had 19 points while matching Barea with a game-high seven assists.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Marc Gasol and the Memphis Grizzlies dumped all the frustration from seven straight losses at San Antonio during a wild two-second sequence. Mike Conley had 30 points, Gasol hit two free throws with 0.7 seconds left and Memphis beat the Spurs 104-103 on Wednesday night. ""It's very special to win here,"" Conley said. ""We haven't won here in so long it feels like. It's hard to beat any Spurs team, no matter who's dressed up in their uniform."" Memphis' last win in San Antonio was Dec. 17, 2014. Ending that skid proved nerve-wracking. San Antonio guard DeMar DeRozan had 24 points, including a fadeaway 15-footer in the left corner with 1.2 seconds remaining for a 103-102 lead after the Spurs trailed for much of the game. Gasol then drew a foul from Rudy Gay on the ensuing inbound pass and hit both free throws, and LaMarcus Aldridge missed a 3-point try at the buzzer. Gasol appeared to hit Aldridge's right arm on his shot, but no foul was called as the crowd booed heavily. Gasol said he got much of the ball, but the Spurs disagreed. ""I thought it was a foul,"" DeRozan said. ""Not even thought. It's a foul. What's right is right is right, what's wrong is wrong. If you call that (against Gay), you gotta call L.A.'s. Just the right call to make."" Memphis led by 10 in the first half and by as many as six in the second before the Spurs rallied. San Antonio opened the fourth quarter on a 13-7 run to take a 90-88 lead on Aldridge's layup. The Spurs held the Grizzlies to 43 points in the second half after allowing 61 in the opening two quarters. ""They made so many huge plays,"" Conley said. ""Big shots at the end and we just had to withstand each and every position and stay calm in every situation. I thought we did a good job of just holding onto it at the end."" The Grizzlies shot 48 percent from the field, got 32 points from their bench and outscored the Spurs 42-38 in the paint, but San Antonio had a 12-2 advantage in the lane in the final period. Aldridge and Gay combined to score 20 points in the final period, but it wasn't enough to keep the Spurs from losing their second straight and fifth in six games. Gay finished with 21 points, and Aldridge had 19 points and 11 rebounds. San Antonio committed only one turnover in the first half but allowed Memphis to shoot 61 percent in the first quarter and 54 percent for the half.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  After all but the last couple of Sacramento Kings had exited the locker room, coach Dave Joerger stood in the doorway and couldn't stop smiling as his center walked toward him. ""That was one hell of game, Willie Cauley-Stein,"" Joerger said. ""Yes, one hell of a game."" Cauley-Stein had faced the NBA's reigning defensive player of year, Rudy Gobert, and didn't flinch. He just nodded at his coach as if it were no big deal. ""I'm faster than him and more elusive. So I just play my game. I'm the same size as him, so I'm not real worried about his length,"" said Cauley-Stein, who scored 23 points to help Sacramento beat the Utah Jazz 119-110 on Wednesday night. ""I give him a lot of misdirection and then I get into his body so he can't jump,"" he added. ""I'm not afraid."" At a time in the game when previous Kings teams would wilt, this Sacramento squad outhustled, outmuscled and outshot the Jazz in the middle of the fourth quarter. Nemanja Bjelica made a 3-pointer with 4:56 remaining to finish a 16-1 run that turned a two-point game into a 105-88 lead. ""You lose games when you stop playing hard and start trying to hold the ball. If you try and stall out the game, you're going to lose,"" said Cauley-Stein, who shot 11 for 15. ""We want to keep being aggressive."" Just when Sacramento looked to be in total control, the Jazz mustered a last-gasp rally. Donovan Mitchell scored 14 points in less than 3 1/2 minutes to bring Utah to 114-110. ""We have the fight in us,"" Mitchell said. ""We've got to do that, not when we're down 15 or 17. ... We've got to do it from the beginning of the game."" Bjelica, who had 18 points, converted a three-point play and Iman Sumpert made two free throws to finish off the Jazz, who have lost four of five. Bogdan Bogdanovich also scored 18. De'Aaron Fox added 17 points and 13 assists for the Kings, who snapped a six-game losing streak to Utah. ""We kept playing at our pace. In close games, guys don't want to run anymore,"" Fox said. ""It's hard to beat us if we're playing at that pace while we're still executing."" Mitchell scored 35 points and awakened the Jazz, who seemed to be slogging through the game until their late surge. Jae Crowder added 16 for Utah. The Kings, quicker to loose balls and crisp on their offensive sets, led by as many as 15 in the first half. Ricky Rubio missed his first seven shots and then suddenly made three in a row in the third quarter. His last shot -- a floating 19-foot jumper -- gave the Jazz their first lead since the opening moments at 72-71. The Kings quickly regained the lead but couldn't extend their advantage to double digits until Fox got into the lane on back-to-back possessions for tough floaters that started the Kings' surge in the final period. GOING THE DISTANCE ""Just keep running is the biggest thing for us. Don't stop,"" Joerger said before the game. ""By the end of the game we're able to run teams down. It's opening up transition shots."" The Kings outscored the Jazz 14-9 in fast-break points. After the game, Fox added: ""With the way that we're playing, we're getting down the court faster than their five. If we have numbers, my job is just to find who's open. The game has definitely slowed down for me and I'm able to make that pass and guys are making shots."" WHERE'S THE DEFENSE? After leading the NBA in defensive efficiency last season, the Jazz are having trouble stopping anyone. ""We have to be able to defend better to win,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""If I could point to one thing, it's our communication. That's the thing that links you together and makes you be able to defend as a group."" Gobert is pointing at himself. ""I think it starts with me. The guys need me. I have to show up and bring the intensity,"" he said. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento's offense seemed one step ahead of the scrambling Utah defense all night, shooting 53 percent from the field and 44 percent on 3-pointers. ... Bogdanovich has scored in double figures in five straight games. He missed the first 10 games of the season.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Three Thunder players were injured and Oklahoma City still left Oracle Arena with a lopsided win against the ailing, slumping two-time defending NBA champions. Russell Westbrook recorded his first triple-double of the season as Oklahoma City defeated the Golden State Warriors 123-95 Wednesday night, when Thunder rookie Hamidou Diallo was carted off on a stretcher with 7:17 left but avoided a serious injury according to the team after X-rays and Warriors doctors evaluated him. OKC's Terrance Ferguson returned from a two-game absence as he welcomed a baby, then went down at the 5:41 mark of the first quarter with a sprained left ankle and didn't return. Nerlens Noel received stitches after getting hit in the face during the second quarter. ""There's just been a lot of things on this road trip that have impacted any level of consistency, our rotation, of having any idea of who's going to be playing,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Diallo's left leg was stabilized as he was wheeled away to applause from the Oracle Arena crowd. Diallo was credited for rebounding Jonas Jerebko's missed layup when they both went down hard. Westbrook began 1 for 6, then hit his stride, finishing with 11 points, 13 assists, 11 rebounds. It was his second game back since missing five with a sprained left ankle, then another when he welcomed twin daughters Saturday night. ""Just having each other's back. When guys go down, we're a family here and we have to have our brother's back, and that's what we're going to do,"" Westbrook said. Paul George had 25 points, nine rebounds and five assists and Steven Adams contributed 20 points and 11 rebounds as the Thunder sent the Warriors to their first four-game skid in nearly six years. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson scored 27 points apiece, with Durant grabbing a season-best 14 rebounds for the Warriors, who were again playing without All-Star starters Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, as well as key reserve Alfonzo McKinnie. ""It wasn't pretty tonight, and it hasn't been these last four games,"" Thompson said. ""If you want to take a positive out of it, that's the first time we've lost four games in a row under Steve (Kerr). That's pretty incredible."" Clearly in pain, Diallo moved himself off the court and was under basket for several minutes. In a loss Monday at Sacramento, Diallo became the first Thunder rookie ever to go at least 7 for 7 from the floor. He made both his 3-point tries on the way to 18 points. Westbrook's 3-pointer 4:17 before halftime put the Thunder ahead 50-37. The Warriors, who held off the Thunder 108-100 in their season opener Oct. 16 and had won the last three matchups, trailed 60-46 at halftime with just 11 assists to 10 turnovers but opened the third with a 13-2 run to get within 62-59. While Golden State dropped 10 of its final 17 games last season, the Warriors hadn't endured a four-game losing streak during the regular season since dropping four in a row from Feb. 26-March 2, 2013. They also lost six straight just before that in February `13. CARE FOR PARADISE The Warriors hosted the boys and girls basketball teams from the Northern California town of Paradise, devastated by the Camp Fire. Golden State COO Rick Welts and forward Jordan Bell greeted coaches Jerry Cleek and Sheila Craft, players and principal Loren Lighthall along with other evacuees before the game. Of the 31 players in attendance, 29 lost their homes in the fire. ""It's fantastic. It means so much to the kids,"" said Cleek, who has been at the school 52 years. Golden State players and Kerr offered messages on the big screen in the second quarter. Six signed jerseys -- by Curry, Durant, Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and Thompson -- were being auctioned while the team also was raising funds through a CrowdRise site, with the Warriors to match up to $25,000. Kerr appreciated the Warriors' efforts to support fire victims during a ""tragic time."" ""We're doing what we can and I think people will appreciate it, but obviously those people up there need much more than just to be able to come to a basketball game,"" Kerr said. ""I would urge everybody out there to chip in and help any way they can."" TIP-INS Thunder: The Thunder improved to 2-4 on the road against the Western Conference. ... G Alex Abrines was out with a viral illness. ... OKC won at Oracle 125-105 on Feb. 6 this year. Warriors: The Warriors dropped to 8-2 at home, 5-1 facing the West. ... Curry missed his seventh straight game with a strained left groin and will be out at least through Saturday's matchup with Sacramento. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated that day. Green was sidelined for the sixth time in eight games -- five of those nursing a sprained right toe while he also sat out last Tuesday vs. Atlanta because of a team-issued suspension. ...

"NEW YORK --  Karl-Anthony Towns thinks the real Derrick Rose is shining once again. Rose scored 25 points, Towns had 21 points and nine rebounds, and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Brooklyn Nets 112-102 on Friday. Rose was 11 for 17 from the field, helping Minnesota get back on track after dropping two in a row. The 30-year-old guard won the 2011 NBA MVP award with the Chicago Bulls. He had been hampered by injuries in recent years before his strong start to this season. ""I love telling Derrick how good he is and how MVP Derrick (has) always been there and is still there,"" Towns said. Taj Gibson had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota, and Jeff Teague finished with 15 points in the Timberwolves' first road win of the season. ""I trust every single person in the locker room to get the job done,"" Towns said. Brooklyn had six players score in double figures, but shot 41.8 percent from the field. Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie had 18 points apiece, and DeMarre Carroll finished with 13. ""We have to do a better job coming out and setting the tone,"" Harris said. ""We just kind of came out and they definitely hit us in the mouth first before we could really engage with them and set the tone early."" The Nets pulled within four on Dinwiddie's two free throws with 3 minutes left. But Rose made a floater and Teague found Robert Covington for a dunk to help the Timberwolves close it out. Minnesota swept the season series, also winning 120-113 on Nov. 12 at Target Center. The Timberwolves have won three in a row against the Nets dating to last season. Jarrett Allen and Shabazz Napier each scored 12 points for Brooklyn, and Allen Crabbe finished with 11. ""We came into the game a little lackadaisical,"" Allen said. The Nets trailed by five at the break, but the Timberwolves grabbed control in the third. Towns had 17 points as Minnesota outscored Brooklyn 35-23 in the quarter for an 89-72 advantage heading to the fourth. ""I think we were searching for energy but we kind of just didn't have the juice,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I see Towns hurt us in the post there in the third quarter.

The Nets scored 11 of the first 15 points in the final quarter to pull within 10 at 93-83 with 9:21 left. Following a timeout by the Timberwolves, Rose made a jumper and a 3-pointer to run the lead back out to 15. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns only played 8:13 in the first half due to foul trouble. He committed two fouls in the first quarter, and another early in the second. ... Minnesota shot 47.8 percent (44 for 92) from the field. It also went 15 for 17 from the foul line. Nets: Harris went 4 for 10 from 3-point range. The team made 14 of 45 attempts from beyond the arc overall. GETTING ADJUSTED Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau described the adjustment for Covington and Dario Saric since coming over in a trade as ""a work in progress."" Covington scored seven points against the Nets, and Saric had three. Covington and Saric were acquired in the Jimmy Butler trade with Philadelphia on Nov. 12. ""Anytime you make a trade midseason that's part of the challenge because they've missed training camp and they know the NBA, but they have to learn their teammates,"" Thibodeau said. ""They're learning a new system, so for the most part I think they've done well. They've adapted well, but it's something we have to continue to work at. They come in early, get extra work in to develop a better understanding of what we're trying to do.""","401070946"
"LOS ANGELES --  Two early surprises to the NBA season met Friday and regulation wasn't enough to settle things. The surging Memphis Grizzlies thought they had things under control, up by eight with less than 2 minutes to play in the fourth quarter, but the Clippers surged to the finish. Danilo Gallinari hit three free throws with 3 seconds to play to force overtime and Los Angeles then ran off with a 112-07 victory. The Clippers outscored Memphis 11-3 to close regulation, holding the Grizzlies without a field goal over the last 3:26 and tying it up when Gallinari swished his pressure free throws. ""It's something I can say I'm pretty good at,"" said Gallinari, a 95.5 percent free-throw shooter on the season. ""It's a mental game at the free throw line."" Gallinari led the Clippers with 20 points, connecting on all nine of his free throws. ""I don't know if his blood pressure ever goes up or down,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""He is one of the best, if not the best free-throw shooter in the league."" Memphis' Marc Gasol, who did not score until the 4:50 mark of the second quarter, led all scorers with 27 points, to go with his 13 rebounds. Rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. added 20 points and Mike Conley 19 for the Grizzlies. Conley fouled out with 2:51 to play in regulation. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff called the sixth foul a ""joke"" and wasn't thrilled with several of the calls that went against the Grizzlies, who have one of the league's best defenses. ""Our defense is where we live,"" Bickerstaff said. ""It's frustrating when we are not allowed to defend the way that we are. That's our reputation and it's frustrating. ""We deserve the respect because of the character of the guys we have, to play this style of basketball. Our technique is good, our position is good. We work on it every single day. There's going to be contact sometimes, but if you're in legal guarding position you're allowed to do it."" The loss snapped the Grizzlies' five-game winning streak and left them and the Clippers at 12-6, temporarily tied with the Portland Trail Blazers for first in the Western Conference. Portland was scheduled to play later Friday. Neither the Grizzlies nor Clippers made the playoffs last season. Montrezl Harrell added 22 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, with five points coming in OT. Lou Williams had 15 points. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Bickerstaff remains impressed by the early play of rookie forward Jackson (12.5 points, 4.4 rebounds), who just turned 19 last month: ""He's extremely gifted and athletic, but the most important thing is his want-to. The first thing he does every day is work on his defense."" Clippers: G Milos Teodosic, who has played in only eight games, told Serbian media he expects to return to European basketball, possibly this season. Rivers said he'd heard the report, but doesn't expect him to return this season. Said Rivers: ""We want Milos to be happy. Obviously, he hasn't played the minutes or at a level he'd like to."" DEFENSIVE STOPPER The Grizzlies trailed 110-107 with 18.7 seconds left in overtime and had the ball, when guard Avery Bradley stripped it from Memphis' Garrett Temple. Bradley was then quickly fouled and made both free throws to seal the win. ""The key to this team -the key to this league -- is when you have your name called, be prepared for every situation,"" Bradley said. ""The opportunity presented itself and I took advantage."" MISSING CONLEY Conley leads the Grizzlies in scoring (20.2 points) and assists (6.0), but they had to play the game's final 7:51 without him after he fouled out. ""I felt like we deserved to win that game,"" Conley said. ""We had plenty of opportunities at the end, that didn't go our way, and they were the better team in overtime. It's tough to play in the situations we were put in at the end of tonight.""","401070947"
"DETROIT --  Detroit has a new Big Three: Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin and Reggie Jackson. The Pistons' trio played major roles in Detroit's 116-111 overtime victory over the Houston Rockets on Friday night as they combined for 73 points and 33 rebounds. They also got some help from little-known rookie Bruce Brown. Two days earlier in Houston, the Rockets beat the Pistons 126-124 behind 43 points from James Harden. This time, though, Pistons coach Dwane Casey put Brown on Harden for most of the fourth quarter and overtime. ""We've always known Bruce could play defense,"" Casey said. ""My experience against James is to find someone to pick him up full court and make him work. Bruce took that opportunity."" Brown, getting plenty of help, stripped Harden on a key late-game possession and held him scoreless in overtime. ""When we played Boston, he guarded Kyrie, (Marcus) Smart, (Terry) Rozier, (Gordon) Hayward and (Marcus) Morris in the same game,"" Griffin said. ""Not many other rookies can do that."" Brown wasn't expecting the assignment, but was happy to give it a shot. ""It's a big challenge, but he's a great scorer,"" he said. ""Honestly, I didn't go into tonight expecting to touch the floor, but I knew the game plan and I knew his tendencies."" Brown did enough for Detroit's three offensive stars to put the game away. Jackson scored 19 of his 22 points after the third quarter, while Griffin had 13, including a key 3-pointer late in regulation and two overtime dunks. Griffin scored 28 points and Drummond had 23 points and 20 rebounds for Detroit, which has won five of seven. Harden scored 33 points for the Rockets, who had won five straight. Clint Capela finished with 29 points and 21 rebounds. The Rockets led 103-101 early in overtime, but the Pistons scored seven straight points, including two dunks by Griffin. Detroit made all five field goal attempts in overtime, and went 7-for-9 from the line. ""They hit some big shots,"" said Chris Paul, who finished with 20 points. ""We had some mistakes, but we played some good defense at times. Good offense beats good defense any day."" Jackson hit five free throws in the fourth quarter and six more in overtime. ""It seemed like we had them stopped on every possession and then someone would get free and we'd foul them for an and-one,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. Houston had a chance to win the game in regulation. Two free throws by Jackson tied the game at 93 with 1:11 to play, but he fouled Harden at the other end. Harden made the first free throw, then grabbed the offensive rebound of his missed second attempt. Brown, though, stole the ball and forced Harden into a foul to prevent a layup with 37.7 seconds to play. The rookie made both free throws to put Detroit ahead 95-94, but Harden's jumper put Houston back in front with 22 seconds to go. Griffin appeared to win the game with a 3-pointer with 2.6 seconds left, but Eric Gordon drove the baseline for a tying layup with 0.1 second left in regulation. ""We should have won the game in regulation,"" D'Antoni said. ""We had our best 3-point defenders out there and we forced Blake into a really tough shot. He just made a great, great play."" Capela and Harden combined for 38 points in the first half, but Drummond and Griffin's 29 points and 20 rebounds were enough to give the Pistons a 61-56 lead at the break. Detroit started the second half with an 11-2 run for a 72-58 advantage, but couldn't keep control. The Rockets outscored the Pistons 21-6 through the rest of the third quarter and took a 79-78 lead on Chris Paul's 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left. The Pistons continued to struggle offensively in the fourth quarter, scoring one point in the first five minutes. The Rockets built their advantage to 85-79, but Griffin and Jackson were able to keep the Pistons in the game. TIP INS Rockets: Houston has lost four of its last five visits to Detroit. . The loss was the Rockets' first in six games against the Eastern Conference this season. Pistons: Detroit made seven 3-pointers, ending a franchise-record streak of seven straight games with at least 10. . DeMarcus Cousins is second in the NBA with 15 20-point, 20-rebound games since Drummond entered the league.","401070948"
"ATLANTA --  Aron Baynes knew the Boston Celtics had a perfect opponent to improve their flow on offense. ""You know we have had a pretty dry spell,"" Baynes said. ""We have gotten good looks, but (shots) haven't been dropping, so to see it go through the hoop a few times tonight to begin the game was a good thing."" Baynes scored a season-high 16 points, Jayson Tatum added 14 and the Celtics snapped a three-game skid with a 114-96 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. Atlanta began the night with the NBA's second-worst record and dropped to 3-16 with its 10th straight loss. Boston, which had lost seven of 10, used a 45-point first quarter to put it out of reach early. Coming off their worst performance of the season in a home loss to the lowly New York Knicks, the Celtics led by 13 in the first when Kyrie Irving hit a dazzling fade-away 3. The lead swelled to 29 midway through the second after Terry Rozier dunked and hit a 3. It was Boston's 10th trey, nine more than Atlanta had at that point. ""I just thought our pace was really good, starters and the bench,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""Defensively, we were really locked in and engaged until the end of the game when we gave up those runouts."" The rebuilding Hawks were 1 for 17 beyond the arc before Alex Len's 3 late in the second. They just hit 17 percent of 35 3-point attempts. Jeremy Lin finished with 19 points and 10 assists, and Len added 17 points in reserve roles for Atlanta. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce was particularly pleased with the effort he got from Lin and guard DeAndre' Bembry, who scored a career-high 14 points. ""Those two guys are the examples in our locker room right now as we are searching and seeking and trying to find something positive,"" Pierce said. ""Those are the two guys that I'm looking at."" Boston had a sloppy close to the second quarter with no field goals in the last 6:19 yet led by 16 at halftime. Tatum's 3, Brown's putback, Tatum's putback dunk and Baynes' hook shot pushed the lead back to 29 midway through the third. Atlanta went on a 16-2 run to close within 15 late in the third before Gordon Hayward hit a baseline jumper, and Smart stole the ball from John Collins and fed Semi Ojeleye for a lay-in. Hayward opened the fourth by taking Daniel Theis' bounce pass and dunking for another 20-point lead. Theis followed with a 3 and Robert Williams III hit a reverse layup to finish off the Hawks with 10 minutes remaining. ""A lot of guys hit shots,"" Tatum said. ""That's key. None of Boston's starters played over 24 minutes. Irving scored 11 of his 13 points in the first. Hayward added 11 points. ""We did what we were supposed to do,"" Irving said. ""Start of a business trip."" TIP-INS Celtics: F Al Horford had a sore left knee and missed his first game of the season. Marcus Morris took his spot in the lineup, making his first start since last season, and finished with eight points. Horford was listed as probable with the same injury before the Knicks game but finished with 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists in 35 minutes. Coach Brad Stevens decided to rest him after Friday's shoot-around. Hawks: G Kent Bazemore did not return after leaving with a left ankle sprain in the second. He went scoreless on two shots in 10 minutes. ... Rookie G Trae Young, the No. 5 overall draft pick, missed his five 3-point attempts and finished with five points, three turnovers and two assists in 19 minutes. BIG SCREEN The Hawks showed a video tribute to Vince Carter midway through the first with congratulations from North Carolina coach Roy Williams and former Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki, among others. Carter, in his 21st season and first with Atlanta, became the 22nd NBA player to score 25,000 points in Wednesday's loss to Toronto. He went scoreless in 10 minutes against Boston.","401070949"
"NEW YORK --  The young Knicks played with poise down the stretch. Emmanuel Mudiay scored a season-high 27 points, rookie Allonzo Trier had a career-high 25 and New York rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 114-109 on Friday night. An undrafted free agent from Arizona, Trier hit two free throws to put the Knicks ahead 104-103, a lead they never relinquished in winning consecutive games for the first time this season. ""I think we have been growing. We are starting to see each other better,"" Trier said. ""We understand the things we need to do in order to close out games. I think it's the little things, the detail things, that we were better at tonight."" Enes Kanter scored 17 for the Knicks and Noah Vonleh had 14. Anthony Davis finished with 33 points and 12 rebounds for New Orleans. Jrue Holiday scored 22 points and Nikola Mirotic added 19. New York trailed 101-92 midway through the fourth quarter. Mudiay's steal and two free throws with 1:09 to play gave the Knicks a 106-103 lead. Milotic missed a 3-point attempt and Mudiay hit a driving layup with 34 seconds left. ""We were just being aggressive, that is what it was,"" said Mudiay, a 2015 Nuggets lottery pick in his second season with the Knicks. ""We got a couple of stops that we wanted. I think that is what really changed the game."" The Pelicans pulled to 111-109 on Davis' uncontested dunk with 8.2 seconds left. But Mudiay hit another free throw and Tim Hardaway Jr. added two more for the final margin. ""We didn't play very good down the stretch. They didn't play very good either, but they played well enough to win the game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Davis did not play in the fourth quarter until only 3:18 remained. ""He said he thought he had a pull in his groin or something, but he came back (to the coaches) and said he felt pretty good about it, so we stuck him back in,"" Gentry added. The Pelicans led by nine in the first quarter, but New York scored the first seven points of the second to take its first lead since the opening basket. The Knicks then increased their advantage to 52-45 on Mudiay's driving layup with 3:15 left. Davis' three-point play with 3.6 seconds remaining gave the Pelicans a 60-59 lead at halftime. He had 24 points and 10 rebounds at the break. New Orleans led 90-87 after the third quarter. ""We beat the Pelicans,"" Kanter exclaimed. ""The bird can't even fly."" TIP-INS: Pelicans: New Orleans, who had won the last two meetings, leads the all-time series 19-17. The Pelicans had not lost to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden since November 15, 2015 (95-87). Knicks: Hardaway missed his first 11 shots before finally connecting on a 3-pointer with 7:10 remaining in the third quarter. He finished the night 2 for 15. FOR STARTERS No Knick player has started every game this season, while the Pelicans have two players, Holiday and E'Twaun Moore, who have been on the floor for the start of each of New Orleans' 19 games.

Former Wildcats Davis, Julius Randle and Darius Miller competed for New Orleans, while Kanter and Kevin Knox appeared on the floor for the Knicks.

"PHILADELPHIA -- On paper, it looked like a mismatch. The Cavaliers didn't view their game against the 76ers that way and it showed. Jordan Clarkson scored 14 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, Rodney Hood had 25, and Cleveland stunned Philadelphia 121-112 on Friday night, snapping the 76ers' perfect home record. Philadelphia entered as the NBA's lone undefeated team at home at 10-0, while the Cavaliers were 0-8 on the road with the worst overall record in the league at 2-14. ""We're not really going to look at our record and count ourselves out of any game,"" coach Larry Drew said. ""We knew it was going to be a tough task. We knew we had to be on point on both ends of the floor. I'm just happy our guys played with the effort and energy they did. And it finally paid off."" Collin Sexton added 23 points, Cedi Osman scored 20, and Tristan Thompson had 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who had lost three in a row, including Wednesday's 109-105 home defeat to the Lakers in LeBron James' return to Cleveland. ""Despite our record, we're tough and resilient,"" said Andrew Harrison, who made a key 3-pointer with 5:12 remaining. ""We all play hard. If we continue to do what we're doing, [the record] will get better."" Joel Embiid had 24 points and 12 rebounds for Philadelphia, which had won four in a row overall and 20 consecutive contests at home dating to last season. The 76ers' last home loss came on March 13, a 101-98 defeat to Indiana. Philadelphia was booed by a large contingent of the sold-out crowd late in the contest. ""We had no spirit,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We didn't play defense in front of our home fans. We're at home. That's a game that you win."" JJ Redick scored 23 points and Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler had 22 apiece for the 76ers. Simmons added 10 assists. ""It doesn't feel good,"" Embiid said. ""We have to learn from it. They came here tonight to prove themselves."" The Cavaliers slowly extended their one-point lead to start the fourth. Cleveland took leads of seven, eight, nine -- on Harrison's 3 -- and 11 before increasing it to 12 on Clarkson's 3 from the right wing with 3:50 left. The advantage eventually grew to 15 points on Clarkson's layup with 1:48, when the outcome was no longer in doubt. ""Once he gets going, he's tough to defend,"" Drew said. ""We count on him to bring instant offense, and he did tonight."" The 76ers took their largest lead on Simmons' layup that made it 79-74 with 2:53 left in the third quarter. The Cavaliers finished the period by scoring 10 of the final 14 points to enter the fourth up 84-83. FOR STARTERS Philadelphia came out sluggish to start the contest, and the Cavaliers took advantage by scoring the first seven points and growing their lead to 22-8 on Sexton's jumper with 4:08 remaining in the first. ""I thought our guys came out at the start of the game and really dictated the pace of the game,"" Drew said. ""Offensively, I thought we did a really good job of executing and we were able to sustain for four quarters.""

"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors turned in their best 3-point shooting performance of the season. The Washington Wizards had one of their worst. Kawhi Leonard had 27 points and 10 rebounds, Kyle Lowry scored 15 points and the Raptors won their fourth straight game, beating the Wizards 125-107 on Friday night. OG Anunoby scored 15 points and Fred VanVleet had 13 as Toronto posted its third straight win over the Wizards and improved its NBA-leading record to 16-4. Danny Green, Anunoby and VanVleet each made three 3-pointers as the Raptors converted a season-high 17 from long range. Toronto shot 43.6 percent (17 for 39) from behind the arc, its highest percentage of the season. ""When we get those games where we can shoot the ball well, it's a big advantage,"" said Lowry, who went 2 for 4 from distance. Washington, in contrast, attempted a season-high 46 shots from long range, making nine. The Wizards were a season-worst 3 for 17 against Brooklyn on Nov. 16. ""We missed a lot of open ones and missed a lot of easy ones that probably should have went down,"" Washington's Bradley Beal said. ""It just comes back to defending better. When that shot's not working, we've got to get back to guarding and we didn't do that."" Beal scored 20 points and Otto Porter Jr. had 17 for the Wizards, who are 2-7 on the road.

Leonard sat out to rest when the Raptors visited Washington on Oct. 20. Toronto won that game 117-113 thanks to a 28-point, 12-assist effort from Lowry. ""It's definitely different with (Leonard) being out there,"" Beal said. ""He's very aggressive. I think we could have made it a little bit tougher on him at times."" The Raptors led 70-62 at the half. Washington took the lead with a 9-0 spurt to begin the third, but Toronto answered with a 10-2 run.

""It was a good win for us,"" Aldridge said. ""Now we're back in the mix for sure. It felt good to get a win.

""When your stars are rolling, that's always better,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""If they're not, you hope that somebody else can pick up the slack.

"CHICAGO --  Erik Spoelstra gave the ball to Josh Richardson. Richardson scored 12 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and Hassan Whiteside had 18 points and 10 rebounds to help the Miami Heat beat the Chicago Bulls 103-96 on Friday night. Spoelstra decided to go without Dwyane Wade in the closing minutes. ""I didn't necessarily do it on purpose, but I did want to see that group finish without Dwyane,"" Spoelstra said. ""I did not want to see him go in there and all of a sudden everyone defer to him. We're going to need that, obviously, because Dwyane is obviously one of the best ever in this league in closing games, but J Rich (Richardson) has been in this situation before a few times. I thought his poise and preparation to get to the proper sports was much better, much more detailed, and even made some plays outs of that, which shows growth."" Wade has taken notice of Richardson's rise as a go-to-player in the Miami offense. ""I think he understands that he's our guy. We're going to him. He's picking up the phone every time we call him for the most part,"" said Wade. Bam Adebayo added 14 points and 13 rebounds, and the Heat held on after nearly squandering a 26-point lead in the fourth quarter. Zach LaVine got the Bulls to 87-84 with 6:07 left, but Richardson had back-to-back baskets and Wayne Ellington answered with a 3. Richardson made his fifth 3 to put the Heat up 100-90 with 2:00 left. Justin Holiday had 27 points and 13 rebounds for the Bulls, and LaVine added 24. ""Again, we continue to show ourselves what we're capable of doing but at the same time we show what we're capable of doing negatively as well, too,"" Holiday said. Within a minute in the second quarter, Whiteside shot two airballs on free throws. His first airball came on the front end of a shooting foul, then he did it again trying to convert a three-point play. Whiteside could get a chuckle about it because the Heat were on a 20-2 run, where he scored 12 point. The Heat outscored the Bulls 32-13 in the second quarter. Whiteside was perfect from the floor in the second quarter, making all five of his attempts, while going 2 for 7 from the free throw line. The Bulls were horrific in the second quarter, making only 2 of 19 field goal attempts, while committing nine turnovers. Whiteside provided the defensive presence for the Heat by blocking three shots in the quarter. ""That was the difference. It's been a tough quarter for us all year long. We just didn't have any resiliency in that second quarter to fight through the tough times,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg. The Heat led 60-39 at the half. Richardson finished with 13 points in the half for Miami and Holiday led the Bulls with 17 points in the half. The Heat led by as many as 26 in the second quarter, but the Bulls were able to get within four points in the fourth quarter. Chicago went on a 9-0 run midway through the third quarter. LaVine capped it off with a dunk. Then in the fourth quarter, Parker scored six consecutive points to get Chicago within 81-77. Parker scored 17 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Heat: James Johnson was in the starting lineup for the first time this season. He underwent surgery for a hernia back in May.  ""I'm going to try to fast track him as much as possible but not at the thought of trying to jam in 30 minutes. He's going to be a big part of what we're doing,"" Spoelstra said. Bulls: Rookie F Chandler Hutchison missed his second straight game with back spasms. ... Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack, who sat courtside, drew a loud ovation when he appeared on the video board during the first quarter.","401070954"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  When Oklahoma City needed a defensive stop, the Thunder -- led by Russell Westbrook -- came up with two of them. Westbrook had 30 points, 12 rebounds -- including two in the 11.2 seconds -- and eight assists and the Thunder held off a late rally by Charlotte to win 109-104 on Friday night, completing a regular-season sweep of the Hornets. Dennis Schroder, who was paired with Westbrook in the starting lineup for the first time this season, scored 23 points and Paul George added 17 points, seven rebounds and six assists for Oklahoma City, which has won 12 of its last 14 games after an 0-4 start. ""Russell Westbrook did a great job putting pressure on the rim, getting fouls and heading to the free-throw line,"" Schroder said. ""I think on the defensive end, even if we didn't score, we locked up and got some stops. I think that was the key. . We missed shots down the stretch, but we always got some stops on the defensive end. That's what we try to focus on, to be a defense-first team."" Kemba Walker had 25 points and eight assists for Charlotte, but the NBA's leader in made 3-pointers went 2 of 10 from behind the arc. With the Hornets down 105-104, he drove and passed to Marvin Williams, who missed a 3-point jumper from the corner. Westbrook rebounded and hit two free throws with 11.2 seconds left. Walker ""made the right play,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""We had a great look to take the lead by two. We trust Marvin to shoot that shot. We got the look we wanted. I thought we executed it very well."" Walker missed a 3-pointer from the right wing with 2.4 seconds left and Westbrook again rebounded and hit two free throws to seal the win for the Thunder. ""I thought we had some really good looks,"" Borrego said. ""Our last two threes were great looks for us. We had a wide-open one to take the lead and had another one to tie the game. We will continue to trust our guys, trust the three ball and move on."" Charlotte rallied from a 13-point third-quarter deficit to close within 93-92 on a put-back by Jeremy Lamb with 5:38 left and was within 97-95 after Walker hit a 3-pointer with 3:49 left. Westbrook answered with a three-point play and Oklahoma City pushed its lead to six points before Williams hit a 3-pointer with 37.1 seconds left to pull Charlotte within 105-104. Westbrook threw ball away with 20.5 seconds left, giving the Hornets a chance to take the lead. Lamb scored 18 points for Charlotte. TIP-INS: Hornets: Reserve G Tony Parker missed the game with bruised ribs. Borrego said Parker was day-to-day .  F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist missed his fifth straight game with a right ankle sprain . Frank Kaminsky recorded a season scoring high for the second straight game, finishing with 12 points after scoring 11 against Indiana on Wednesday . Williams' 10 points gave him 10,002 for his career .  Lamb tied his career high for made free throws, going 8 for 8. Thunder: Coach Billy Donovan said G Terrance Ferguson, who sprained his left ankle in a win Wednesday at Golden State, will be reevaluated in 10 to 12 days. The Thunder said Thursday rookie G Hamidou Diallo, who also sprained his left ankle during that game, would be reevaluated in seven to 10 days .. Two-way player Deonte Burton scored a career-high 11 points. M(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H UNIT In addition to the injuries to Ferguson and Diallo, the Thunder's usual starting shooting guard, Andre Roberson, still is working his way back from a torn left patellar tendon he suffered in January. Alex Abrines, who had missed the previous four games due to a viral illness, came off the bench for the Thunder but played only seven minutes. With all of the injuries, depth was an issue for the Thunder's backcourt, which is one reason Donovan chose to start Westbrook and Schroder -- who was coming off a 32-point outing against Golden State -- together. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, usually a deep reserve, was the first player off the bench for the Thunder, and Burton played 21 minutes. Even with substitutions patterns significantly different than they were used to, the Thunder didn't seemed flustered at all. ""We're still going to play the same way, regardless of who's in or who's out,"" George said. ""I think we've got a certain style that we've got to play at. It's just up-tempo, fast, and defensively we're just going to get after it. Regardless of who is in the lineup, we've got principle we stick to.""","401070955"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Phoenix Suns didn't look like the team with the second-worst record in the NBA in facing Milwaukee. The Suns turned the tables on the league's second-best team, controlling the game from the outset and withstanding a late rally, defeating the Bucks 116-114 on Friday night on Jamal Crawford's jumper with 0.8 seconds left. The victory gave the Suns their first road win of the season. ""We showed a lot of grit,"" said Crawford, in his 19th season. ""Everybody was so tied together. Everybody was so engaged. We were saying the right things on the bench. This seems like the most gratifying win."" Devin Booker had 29 points, and T.J. Warren 19 for Phoenix. The Suns won for just the second time in their last nine games and ended a six-game losing streak to the Bucks. Milwaukee lost for just the fifth time in 18 games this season. ""We came ready to play from the get-go,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We came to compete. It was a challenging moment for us when they came back."" Deandre Ayton credited his teammates for not folding after the Bucks stormed back to take a late fourth-quarter lead. ""It was the first time we actually answered back from a punch from another team,"" Ayton said. ""The energy on the court was insane. I just felt that we were going to win that game."" Even so, the Bucks still nearly pulled out the victory. After Crawford's jumper with Malcolm Brogdon draped on him, Milwaukee called a timeout. Khris Middleton, after a quick head fake, made a corner 3 after the buzzer. The call was confirmed after a brief review. ""I hesitated for some reason,"" Middleton said. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a season-high 35 points to lead Milwaukee, and Brogdon added 22 points. The Bucks were coming off a 143-100 home victory over Portland on Wednesday night. ""We've got to be able to come out with more energy, especially with a team like that,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""When you play around with a game, the game kills you."" Middleton tied it at 108 on a free throw for Suns coach Igor Kokoskov's technical foul. Antetokounmpo's layup put the Bucks up 110-108. Booker was whistled for a technical foul, and Middleton again converted to put Milwaukee up by three. Brogdon was fouled as he made a driving layup, and his free throw put the Bucks up by six and capped a frantic 14-0 run. A three by Trevor Ariza pulled the Suns within three with about a minute left. Warren's traditional three-point play tied it at 114. After Antetokounmpo's turnover, Phoenix got possession of the ball with 12.2 seconds left, setting up Crawford's winner. SECOND OPTION Crawford wasn't the first option on the Suns' final possession. The play had been designed for Booker to get the first look. ""I got the ball and I looked for (Booker), but (Eric) Bledsoe was still on him so I didn't want to chance it, trying to get it to him,"" Crawford said. ""I'm comfortable in that situation."" UP FOR THE CHALLENGE Ayton said he relished the opportunity to guard Antetokounmpo late in the game. ""I'm a competitor. That stuff is in my blood. I'm a lion. I take my pride into it. I just knew we needed this stop and I got it. That's it."" MISSING IN ACTION Bucks' center Brook Lopez missed all 12 of his 3-point attempts, leaving coach Mike Budenholzer dumbfounded. ""It's a surprise. He's a great shooter,"" Budenholzer said. ""Some nights, it's not your night. ""I think the positive was that he kept shooting. It takes a lot of fortitude to keep shooting. We'll keep pushing him."" TIP-INS Suns: Made 14 of 23 shots (61 percent) in the first quarter. Bucks: G Donte DiVincenzo missed his fourth consecutive game with a left quadriceps strain. ""I think he's close to what we had hoped but I don't have an update other than I know he's making progress in the right direction,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said.","401070956"
"DENVER --  Mason Plumlee does a little of everything for Denver -- including a pretty good Nikola Jokic impersonation. Plumlee had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and wowed the home crowd with his Jokic-like, no-look pass to Trey Lyles in the Nuggets' 112-87 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. Plumlee had four assists, the most impressive coming when he flipped a pass over his right shoulder to a cutting Lyles for a layup. ""I know Mason, he was looking, so I figured I'd cut and he did his own thing from there,"" said Lyles, who scored a season-high 22 points. ""Mason's one of our best passers as a big. He looks for me all the time so I'm grateful."" Jokic has become a fan favorite with his highlight-reel passes, and he was content to pile up vanilla assists on Friday. He finished with 11 and 10 rebounds but fell four points shy of a triple-double. It was the third time this season Jokic missed out on a triple-double because he failed to score 10 or more points. Jokic assisted on Denver's first four baskets of the game and nearly had a double-double at halftime. He only took seven shots and missed all three of his 3-point attempts. ""Nikola does have that flare, that's why we play through him so much,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""Tonight he scored six points but had 11 assists and 10 rebounds. That's how he can impact the game."" The Nuggets didn't need him to win their second in a row at home. Lyles and Plumlee provided enough offense off the bench. Lyles finished four points shy of his career best, thanks in part to Plumlee's pass. ""We didn't make eye contact but I saw him dive,"" Plumlee said. ""He's a really good cutter, he knows how to move off offensive rebounds. He had been attacking the basket all night and he went up and had a great finish."" Terence Ross led Orlando with 18 points and hit his first seven shots. His first miss came with 7:48 left and Denver comfortably ahead. ""The bottom line is we got worked,"" Magic guard Evan Fournier said. ""They were the most aggressive team. We tried to execute, but we didn't have any flow or intensity. They kept scoring and we had to take the ball out of the net every time."" The Nuggets led by 11 early in the fourth quarter before pulling away for an easy win. Plumlee scored four straight points, Lyles hit a layup and a three-point play and Jamal Murray, who had 16 points, drained a 3-pointer from the top during a 17-2 run that gave Denver a 27-point lead. Denver's biggest advantage was 29 points. ""If we lose by one or 25, doesn't make any difference,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""The disappointing thing is the way we played."" TIP-INS Magic: Nikola Vucevic had 16 points. ... Former Denver center Timofey Mozgov (sore right knee) has not played this season and Clifford said he is ""a ways away"" from returning. ... Orlando has lost 14 of its last 16 games in Denver dating to 2003. Nuggets: Denver is in the midst of its third back-to-back this season.

Harris was walking without crutches or a boot after the game and when asked if he would play Saturday at Oklahoma City said, ""I plan to.""","401070957"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Kevin Durant knew the Warriors would have to earn it and play well in every way to end a frustrating funk that lasted more than a week. Durant scored 32 points, Klay Thompson had 31 and Golden State snapped its worst losing streak since early 2013 at four games, beating the Portland Trail Blazers 125-97 on Friday night. ""I don't believe in like, it's just going to be over when it's over. In the NBA, I don't believe in fairytales and the emotions that come into this,"" Durant said. ""It's not going to just be over unless we got out there and impose our will on the basketball court like we did tonight. And it's not going to just happen for us tomorrow. We've got to play with that same passion and energy that we played with tonight."" Durant was 13 of 21 from the field, dished out eight assists, had seven rebounds and three of his team's 11 blocks. Thompson hit five of his first seven shots and grabbed a season-high eight boards for the undermanned two-time defending champions. Two-time MVP Stephen Curry, in a car accident earlier in the day that left him uninjured, sat out again with a strained left groin and fellow All-Star Draymond Green also remained sidelined because of a sprained right toe. Jusuf Nurkic had 22 points and eight rebounds for Portland on a night Damian Lillard shot just 9 of 24 for 23 points and eight assists. CJ McCollum added 19 points and five assists. Golden State started the second with a 22-5 burst to build a 46-32 lead midway through the quarter. Durant's driving dunk and three-point play 2:01 before halftime put his team up 59-40. Coach Steve Kerr knew that once his team returned to better offensive execution -- solid screens, sharp cuts, penetrating to the basket -- it would lead to more open shots the Warriors hadn't been getting during this recent funk. The four-game skid was the longest under fifth-year coach Kerr and Golden State hadn't lost more than that consecutively since dropping six straight from Feb. 5-19, 2013. Quinn Cook, playing in Curry's place, scored 19 points with five 3-pointers as the Warriors went 17 for 32 from deep. Shaking his head reading the stat sheet, Thompson said, ""53 percent is a welcome sight after the week we had."" ""You saw in our energy tonight how much we wanted this win,"" Thompson said. Shaun Livingston scored 11 points and blocked a pair of shots in 16 minutes off the bench, while Jordan Bell contributed five points, seven assists and five rebounds. He has not played regularly this season. Two of the top teams in the Western Conference were both coming off embarrassing defeats two days earlier: Golden State a 123-95 loss to Oklahoma City and Portland 143-100 at Milwaukee in which the Blazers never led. The Warriors have won the last eight with the Blazers at home but had lost two straight overall. ""You lose that many games in a row and you're a championship basketball team, obviously you're going to be looking to turn that around,"" Lillard said. CURRY CAR CRASH Curry was driving a black Porsche on Friday morning en route to work when the driver of a Lexus lost control and struck his car. California Highway Patrol Officer Herman Baza said Curry stopped in the center median and as he waited for officers to arrive, another sedan lost control and rear-ended his Porsche. Baza said no one was injured or arrested and that rain was a factor in the crash. Kerr said his point guard was ""a little shaken up"" from the scare and ""thankfully nobody was hurt and Steph's doing fine."" The coach then said playfully: ""I think he has another car that he can drive, too. I think he's going to be OK. Or he can borrow one from somebody else."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: The Blazers haven't won at Golden State since exactly five years ago, 113-101 on Nov. 23, 2013. ... Portland took two of three from the Warriors last season.

Curry missed his eighth straight game with a strained left groin and will be out at least through Saturday's matchup with Sacramento. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated that day. ...

"LOS ANGELES -- Although the Los Angeles Lakers haven't won many games with defense over the last half-decade, LeBron James can inspire his new teammates to all sorts of feats that seemed impossible not too long ago. James had 22 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, and he seized control of an ugly game with nine points in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' seventh win in eight games, 90-83 over the Utah Jazz on Friday night. Brandon Ingram scored 24 points while the Lakers struggled in their first game back from an Eastern Conference road trip, but still persevered to earn the final win in this franchise's first 7-1 stretch since the last eight games of the 2012-13 season. Although the Lakers have shown signs of being a dynamic offensive team around James, there wasn't a sign to be seen against the undermanned Jazz, other than Ingram's uncommonly aggressive performance. The Lakers committed a season-high 24 turnovers and managed just 10 assists all night, struggling to get out on the break and foundering in half-court sets. So they produced one of their best defensive games of the season, holding Utah to the fewest points scored by an LA opponent since last February. ""There's going to be games where you just don't shoot the ball well, and tonight we turned the ball over,"" James said. ""We're trying to be a really good team, and there's going to be games where we've got to do it defensively. Tonight we did that."" Neither team took a commanding lead in the second half until James hit a layup and a 3-pointer on consecutive possessions with 3:15 to play. James then blocked a shot by Alec Burks in the final seconds as Los Angeles held on to snap its seven-game skid against Utah. ""We never really got in a rhythm shooting the ball,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Some of it is Utah is a really good defensive team, and some was us playing somewhat selfish basketball. There were positions that we should have made extra passes, and we harp on that all the time. We'll continue to harp on that."" Donovan Mitchell scored four points before he bruised his ribs in the second quarter and didn't return, depriving the Jazz of their top producer and compounding their already formidable offensive struggles. The Jazz won't provide an update on Mitchell's condition before Saturday. ""He's our leading scorer, so it impacts the game,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's not a crutch or an excuse. I liked the fact that we kept competing."" Burks scored 17 points and Joe Ingles had 16, but the Jazz have lost three straight and five of six. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell was 2 of 9 and committed two turnovers before his injury. ... Rudy Gobert had 13 points and seven rebounds. Lakers: Josh Hart played 14 scoreless minutes despite a strained tendon in his left ankle. ... After returning at 4 a.m. Thanksgiving morning from a trip to Florida and Cleveland, Los Angeles has begun a stretch with six of seven at Staples Center. ... JaVale McGee had 12 points, and Ball added nine points and 10 rebounds. POST-TURKEY MALAISE Neither team did much to distinguish itself early on the first game back from Thanksgiving. The Lakers held Utah under 30 percent shooting for most of the first half, but then blew an 11-point lead in the final 3 1/2 minutes while committing 13 turnovers in the first half. Ingram and Lonzo Ball were Los Angeles' biggest contributors early, with both youngsters going hard to the hoop. James had only four points in 16 minutes at halftime, and he had only five assists on the first 21 field goals by the Lakers' stagnant offense. GETTING DEFENSIVE While the Lakers had their own success on defense, the Jazz are among the NBA's premier defensive teams. Utah held the up-tempo Lakers to 13 fast-break points and just five offensive rebounds in addition to LA's 24 turnovers. ""If we're not making shots, we've got to do something else to try to win, and tonight that was playing defense,"" Thabo Sefolosha said. ""That was working for us, but we couldn't make it work on the other end.""","401070959"
"CLEVELAND --  Cavaliers coach Larry Drew believes his team is starting to figure things out. Cleveland's players are proving him right, at least for the last two nights. Rookie Collin Sexton scored a season-high 29 points and the Cavaliers won consecutive games for the first time this season, beating Houston 117-108 on Saturday night. Cleveland (4-14) won 121-112 in Philadelphia on Friday and rode that momentum against the Rockets, overcoming 40 points by James Harden. ""We beat good teams,"" Drew said. ""As I told our guys, I really believe this team is still scratching the surface and there is definitely room to improve."" Chris Paul, who is second on the team in scoring and leads Houston in assists, was rested after the Rockets lost in overtime to Detroit on Friday. Paul's absence left most of the scoring load to Harden, who played the entire second half. Drew thinks the Cavaliers are taking positive steps after losing 11 of 12 to start the season and dealing with coach Tyronn Lue being fired and All-Star forward Kevin Love having foot surgery. ""It's not complicated,"" Drew said. ""You have to play hard every night to give yourself a chance. We're starting to do that. You're starting to see guys play with a lot more confidence."" Sexton, taken with the eighth pick in the draft, was 14 for 21 from the floor and hit several key baskets in the second half as the Cavaliers held off multiple runs from the Rockets. ""I'm going out there and playing my game, getting to my shots that I know I'm capable of making nine times out of 10,"" Sexton said. Harden was 14 for 30 from the floor with 13 assists in 44 minutes, but committed nine turnovers. The reigning MVP scored 24 points in the first half, including 15 for the second straight night in the first quarter. Harden has scored at least 30 points in four consecutive games. The first half had 12 lead changes, but Cleveland went ahead for good early in the second quarter. ""We gave them confidence, offensive rebounds, giving them second-chance rebounds,"" Harden said. ""That's pretty much it."" Harden made two free throws in the third quarter, but both were waved off because of his own foul line violations. ""It shocked me,"" he said. ""Two times in a row."" Eric Gordon started at point guard and scored 28 points, but the Rockets (9-9) have dropped two straight after winning eight of 10. Tristan Thompson had 16 points and 20 rebounds for Cleveland. Jordan Clarkson added 20 points. Sexton and Clarkson hit baskets after Houston cut a 10-point deficit to 106-102 with five minutes to play. Rodney Hood's 3-pointer gave Cleveland a 115-104 lead with 2:47 remaining. STRAIGHT TO THE POINT Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni had a simple explanation for the loss. ""We played soft to start the game and they got going,"" he said. ""They gained some confidence, and it's hard to turn them off when they get started. We're playing a lot of guys a lot of minutes, but this biggest thing was, mentally and physically, we were soft to start the game."" WELL, IT SOUNDS SIMPLE Drew laughed when asked for the best defensive strategy against Harden. ""Just hope he misses,"" Drew said. ""He can beat you in. He can beat you out. He's really good."" MAPPING IT OUT The Rockets want to be cautious with how much the 33-year-old Paul plays. The nine-time All-Star is in his 14th season. ""The plan was always to monitor his workload,"" D'Antoni said. Paul scored 20 points in 37 minutes Friday. He averages 17.9 points and 7.7 assists in 15 games. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston had won 10 of the last 12 meetings with Cleveland going into the game. ... Friday's game began a stretch that will see the Rockets play seven of nine on the road. ... C Clint Capela had 12 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots in 40 minutes. Cavaliers: F David Nwaba started for the third straight game in place of Larry Nance. Nwaba had steals on Houston's first two possessions that resulted in Cleveland baskets. ... G George Hill (sprained right shoulder) has begun shooting drills, but Drew isn't sure when he'll return. Hill has missed the last eight games.","401070960"
"WASHINGTON --  After struggling defensively this season, the Washington Wizards took advantage of another team's guarding woes. Otto Porter Jr. scored a season-high 29 points and John Wall had 22 points and eight assists in Washington's 124-114 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night. Austin Rivers had 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter for the Wizards, who shot a season-high 56.7 percent (51 of 90) in a game between the league's second- and third-worst defenses entering Saturday. Both teams shot about 62 percent in the first half, but the Wizards held the Pelicans to 17 of 48 from the floor (35.4 percent) after the break. ""We just did what we needed to do, and that was all on the defensive end,"" said Wizards guard Bradley Beal. ""We accepted the challenge of guarding them and taking away the 3-point line. They made a lot of them tonight still. But it was our defense that won us the game."" Beal also had 18 points, one of six Wizards to score in double figures on a night the Pelicans were without injured All-Star forward Anthony Davis. Julius Randle tied a season high with 29 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. He started in place of Davis, who was ruled out during pregame warmups after straining his right hip in Friday's loss at the New York Knicks. Nikola Mirotic added 22 points and E'Twaun Moore had 19 as the Pelicans finished a three-game road trip winless, sinking to 2-9 on the road overall and 0-4 without Davis this season. ""Our defense is atrocious right now,"" said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. ""Especially on the road. You're not going to be able to win games on the road until you can at least control the ball somewhat and take away all the driving lanes and take away the open 3s."" In a game with 14 lead changes, New Orleans held the advantage early in the fourth quarter before the Wizards used a 15-5 run to pull away. Porter tipped in a miss and then slammed in Wall's alley-oop feed to put Washington up 113-104 with 5:15 left, the largest lead in the game to that point. Rivers added a pair of runners to close the stretch, giving Washington a 119-107 lead with 2:06 to play, sealing a win that came despite continued team struggles from beyond the arc. Washington went 10 of 29 from 3-point range and only 3 of 13 after halftime. ""We had a lot of 3s that wasn't falling,"" Wall said. ""But guys did a better job of just attacking on their (defensive) switches in the second half."" FOUR PLAY The Wizards used a four-guard lineup for part of the fourth quarter, featuring Wall, Beal, Rivers, Tomas Satoransky and forward Markieff Morris. ""I think they just had trouble keeping us out of the paint,"" Rivers said of the lineup. ""It's a tough lineup to guard. We had four guys who can attack the basket, and then our fifth guy is Kieff, who can spread the floor. There's really no stopping us. It's really on us to make shots at that point."" DAVIS DOWN Davis returned in the fourth quarter Friday in New York after hurting his hip in the third, but was held out of the back end of the Pelicans' fourth back-to-back game set this season. It's unclear if he'll be available for New Orleans' next game on Monday. ""We don't know,"" Gentry said. ""Obviously, he'll work out tomorrow and have some rehab tomorrow."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Used their eighth different starting lineup of the season because of Davis' absence. . Have allowed an average of 126 points in their four games without Davis this season. Wizards: Porter scored 16 points over the first 7:21 of the game, hitting all three of his 3-point attempts and 6-of-7 shots overall. . C Dwight Howard (sore glute) missed a third consecutive game. He has played in only nine of Washington's 19 games this season.","401070961"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Karl-Anthony Towns had 35 points and 22 rebounds, Derrick Rose scored 22 points off the bench and the Minnesota Timberwolves pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 111-96 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. Jeff Teague added 18 points for Minnesota, which won for the fifth time in seven games since trading Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia. Both the Timberwolves and Bulls were playing the second game of a back-to-back and their third game in four nights in a listless, sloppy affair. Zach LaVine scored 28 points and Jabari Parker had 27, keeping their streak of 20-point games intact. Both players have reached 20 points in the past three games, but Chicago lost for the sixth time in seven games. Justin Holiday had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls. Neither team led by more than six points until Minnesota slowly started to pull away in the fourth. Towns scored 8 points as the Wolves started the period on a 12-2 run. Chicago committed three turnovers and shot 1-of-9 to start the quarter. Minnesota was playing in the third city in four nights and started the game shooting 3-of-12. Towns picked up the Wolves with 22 points in the second half. Andrew Wiggins and Robert Covington never recovered for the Wolves. Wiggins was scoreless on 0-for-12 shooting. Covington was 0-for-11 in the first half and finished 1-for-18 with 4 points. Rose picked up the slack by reaching 20 points for the seventh time in the past nine games. TIP-INS Bulls: Rookie F Chandler Hutchison was a game-time decision with back spasms. Hutchinson was active but didn't play for the third consecutive game. ... Coach Fred Hoiberg said Lauri Markkanen had a 2-on-2 workout involving some ""controlled contact"" as he tries to return from an elbow injury that has caused him to miss the entire season.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Denver Nuggets overcame significant odds to pull out a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday. Their second-leading scorer, Gary Harris, was out with a sore left ankle. It was their third game in four nights and the Thunder entered the game tied for the best record in the Western Conference. Despite all that, Jamal Murray had 22 points, eight rebounds and eight assists to lead the Nuggets to a 105-98 win. Denver coach Michael Malone was proud of his team. ""I said, `We don't make excuses, we find ways,' and I thought our guys did that,"" he said. ""Heck of a win."" Russell Westbrook had 16 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds for his second triple-double of the season and the 106th of his career. But he shot just 6 of 23 and missed all six of his shots in the fourth quarter. Malone said Torrey Craig defended Westbrook well. ""I thought Torrey did a heck of a job of keeping Westbrook in front of him for most of the night,"" Malone said. ""No one can guard him by themselves, and we gave necessary help when appropriate. Guys were just locked in."" Paul George had 24 points and 11 rebounds, and Dennis Schroder added 18 points for the Thunder. Denver held Oklahoma City to 35.9 percent shooting. Nikola Jokic and Trey Lyles each scored 16 points and Juancho Hernangomez added 15 for the Nuggets. Denver's largest lead was 25 points in the second quarter. The Nuggets shot 50 percent in the first half to lead 63-42 at the break. ""I thought their physicality and their presence at the basket certainly overwhelmed us a little bit,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""When I say overwhelmed us, they were the aggressor. They were making an impact."" Oklahoma City missed 18 of its first 20 3-point shots, but the Thunder got it going late in the third quarter and trimmed the deficit to 79-66 by the end of the period. George hit a 3 to cut the deficit to 80-71 early in the fourth, and Denver called a timeout. A 3-pointer by Oklahoma City's Jerami Grant trimmed Denver's lead to 96-90 with just over three minutes to play. A key follow shot by Craig put Denver up 101-94 with just over a minute remaining. ""We didn't panic,"" Lyles said. ""We didn't get loose with the ball tonight. We took care of it. We knew where we were supposed to be on the floor offensively and defensively. Guys knocked down shots."" Donovan said his team used the right approach to get back into the game. ""You've also got to understand that you've got to keep hitting singles,"" Donovan said. ""I thought for a while there midway through that third quarter we were just kind of hitting singles and chipping our way, chipping our way, and we got it down to five, and we had our chances and our opportunities."" TIP-INS Nuggets: F Paul Millsap went down with a leg injury in the first quarter and limped off the court, but he returned. ... Lyles went 6 for 6 from the field and 2 for 2 from the free-throw line. Thunder: G Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot got his first start of the season. ... G Hamidou Diallo sat out after spraining his left ankle Friday against Charlotte. ... G Alex Abrines was called for a technical in the second quarter. George got one in the fourth. QUOTABLE Malone on Denver's defensive effort: ""They know that when we defend at this level, we can not only beat anybody, but we can win anywhere,"" Malone said.

"DALLAS --  J.J. Barea held the shooter's pose for several seconds before big center DeAndre Jordan picked him up and carried him to the bench , the diminutive Dallas guard high-fiving everybody along the way. It just felt like a big 3-pointer in the Mavericks' sixth straight home victory. Barea scored 20 points and tag-teamed with Wesley Matthews on back-to-back 3s to take control in the fourth quarter of a 113-104 victory over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night. ""I was mad that I missed the one before that one, went in and out on me,"" Barea said. ""First time I think I've been lifted up from the other side of the court all the way to the bench. We're having fun."" Harrison Barnes also had 20 points, teenage rookie Luka Doncic totaled 15 points and matched Barea with eight assists, while starting at point guard with Dennis Smith Jr. sidelined by a wrist injury, as the Mavericks (9-9) got back to .500 with their seventh win in nine games. It's the latest Dallas has been .500 or better since the end of the 2015-16 season, and it's the first six-game home winning streak for the Mavericks in almost two years. Jayson Tatum scored 21 points and Kyrie Irving and Marcus Smart had 19 apiece for the Celtics, who followed a win with a loss in a back-to-back for the third straight time this season a night after winning in Atlanta. Boston was without Gordon Hayward, who sat with soreness in his surgically repaired left ankle, in part because of playing on consecutive nights. Just like a Dallas team coming off consecutive woeful seasons, the Celtics (10-10) are at .500 coming off two straight trips to the Eastern Conference finals. ""We don't impose our fear and will on teams,"" said Smart, who had to be held back from fans by Irving in the final seconds against his hometown team. ""Last year, teams when they came in and played the Celtics, they knew they were in for a fight. This year, teams can't wait to play us and that's a problem."" The Mavericks led by five starting the fourth quarter but pushed the lead to 106-90 on those consecutive 3-pointers from Barea and Matthews, who had 15 points after missing three straight games and four of the past five with a left hamstring strain. Doncic looked like a natural at the point from the start with five assists in the first quarter while making all three of his 3-point attempts for nine points. In one sequence, he sent Marcus Morris lunging toward the basket with a fake away from the ball, then watched Irving fly past him by faking the shot before making a 3. Irving got rolling in the second quarter, scoring nine points on 4-of-5 shooting while helping cut an 11-point deficit to three at halftime (59-56). DECKING DONCIC Doncic was doing enough for the Celtics to feel the need to try to knock him off his game in the third quarter. Jaylen Brown put a forearm in Doncic's chest when he was looking another direction while running up the floor and sent the 19-year-old sprawling. Brown's move came after Doncic intercepted a pass in transition near midcourt, drove to the baseline and slipped a pass to Jordan for a dunk. Jordan was given his second technical for hanging on the rim, but officials ruled it a non-unsportsmanlike technical, allowing Jordan to avoid an ejection as he finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds. Brown received an offsetting technical on a video review for the blindside hit on Doncic. CHIPPY LATE, TOO Doncic had to be separated from Brown after getting knocked to the floor, and there was another dustup when Smart shoved Maxi Kleber not long after they were part of a jump ball in the final seconds, long after the outcome had been decided. Smart was assessed a technical. TIP-INS Celtics: Al Horford returned after missing his first game of the season to rest a sore left knee. He had eight points and eight rebounds. ... Brown scored 16 points, and Morris added 13. ... Irving was 9 of 24 from the field with six assists and five turnovers. Mavericks: F/C Dwight Powell missed his third straight game with a left knee injury. ... Coach Rick Carlisle said Smith sprained his right wrist in a loss to Memphis two games earlier.

"MILWAUKEE --  Facing a potential second loss at home in two nights, Giannis Antetokounmpo unleashed a furious rally. When he'd finished, his teammates did the rest. Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 18 rebounds, and the Bucks overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the San Antonio Spurs 135-129 on Saturday night. ""I was feeling relaxed,"" said Antetokounmpo, who scored 14 points in the final period and heard chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" each time he stepped to the free-throw line. ""I had a little bit of energy saved up for the fourth quarter."" DeMar DeRozan scored 34 points for the Spurs, who took a 106-95 lead with 11 minutes to play after a jumper by Rudy Gay. But the Bucks, who dropped a game to Phoenix on Friday, roared back in this one, which featured 26 lead changes. They took it for the final time when Antetokounmpo hit a pair of free throws with 2:44 left that made it 123-122. ""Giannis did a hell of a job keeping us in that game, and we kind of helped him out at the end,"" Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe said. Khris Middleton hit a key 3-pointer, Bledsoe drove to the hoop for a contested layup and Malcolm Brogdon knocked down a 3 off a drive and dish from Bledsoe with 8.9 seconds to play to put the game out of reach. ""If I'm going to have the ball at the end of the game in situations like that, I've got to be able to know when to score and when to pass,"" said Bledsoe, who had 20 points and 10 assists. ""Malcolm did a great job being in the right spot, and knocked it down."" DEROZAN DOMINANT DeRozan has averaged 26.4 points in his last 15 games, including playoffs, against Milwaukee. But no one on the Spurs had an answer for Antetokounmpo. ""He is definitely a tough task,"" DeRozan said. ""He is so long, once he gets anywhere around the rim, it is kind of tough."" Davis Bertans came off the bench with 17 points for the Spurs, who also got 18 from Bryn Forbes and 15 from LaMarcus Aldridge. ""We were in the game the whole time, we just couldn't get a stop down the stretch,"" Aldridge said. SPEEDY SPURS It took San Antonio less than five minutes to wipe out Milwaukee's early 15-point lead the Bucks built by starting 12 of 13 from the field. The Spurs went on to lose for the sixth time in the last eight games despite an 11-point lead late. ""It is tough to have control of the game and not win,"" Aldridge said. TIP-INS Spurs: Coach Gregg Popovich called departed star Kawhi Leonard a great player, but not a leader when discussing Patty Mills' leadership role. ""Kawhi's talent will always be missed, but that leadership wasn't his deal at the time. That may come as he progresses,"" Popovich said before the game. Leonard was traded with Danny Green to the Raptors for DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round pick in the offseason. Bucks: Brogdon finished with 23 points, Middleton 21 and Sterling Brown 11. . F Ersan Ilyasova (right knee soreness) dressed but did not play. . Antetokounmpo was fouled in the act of shooting 55 feet from the basket at the end of the first quarter by Derrick White. Antetokounmpo made all three shots and White didn't see the court the rest of the way. . Brook Lopez, who went 0 for 12 from 3-point range on Friday night, hit his first attempt against San Antonio.","401070965"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Klay Thompson will be thrilled with the winning shot any way it comes. Kevin Durant will gladly accept that a jump ball he tipped away against Willie Cauley-Stein in the waning moments meant nearly as much as all those jumpers and free throws he hit in a sensational scoring performance. Thompson put back his own miss with 5 seconds left, Durant scored a season-high 44 points, and the Golden State Warriors barely held off the Sacramento Kings 117-116 on Saturday night in a wild finish between the Northern California neighbors. ""I don't know if I got fouled, but who cares I got the putback,"" Thompson said. ""You'll take a game-winner any way you can get it I don't care how ugly it is."" Durant tipped a jump ball to the backcourt just before the buzzer sounded, but a replay review was held to determine whether the Kings had called timeout -- which was granted with 0.3 seconds on the clock. The Warriors subsequently called their own, and the Kings failed to get a shot. ""I just tried to tip it as far away from their basket as possible,"" Durant said. Durant converted two free throws with 1:27 left and also had 13 rebounds and seven assists, while Thompson wound up with 31 points -- the second straight night the two each scored 30 or more. Buddy Hield had 28 points on 12-for-21 shooting and seven rebounds. Rookie Marvin Bagley III contributed 20 points and a season-best 17 rebounds off the bench, but missed the first of two free throws with 1:08 remaining. ""That was a very good basketball game to watch, to be a part of. I thought we competed our tails off,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Thompson shot 12 of 26 with five 3-pointers as Splash Brother Stephen Curry missed his ninth straight game because of a strained left groin . Fellow All-Star Draymond Green is still nursing a sprained right toe. Durant's 3-pointer with 6:22 left got Golden State within 108-105, then he converted a tying three-point play the next time down before Quinn Cook's go-ahead 3 the following possession. Durant had 16 in the second quarter, making all eight of his free throws. He finished with a season-high 16 free throws on 17 attempts. The two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP also committed seven of the Warriors' 14 turnovers. Damian Jones added 13 points and six rebounds in a stronger effort from the center position in Golden State's fifth back-to-back, when the Warriors went just 10 of 34 from beyond the arc. ""He was a monster out there,"" Thompson said. The Warriors snapped a four-game losing streak, their longest under Steve Kerr and worst since early 2013, a night earlier against Portland. Kerr stuck with the same starting lineup from that 125-97 win but the Warriors trailed by 10 late in the second before closing the half on an 8-2 run to get within 64-60 at intermission. The Kings had won their previous two matchups at Oracle Arena, last season becoming just the third team over the past five seasons to win twice on Golden State's home floor. CURRY UPDATE Curry, the two-time MVP, was re-examined Saturday and is expected to resume practicing next week with a strong chance he would return to game action during an upcoming five-game road trip. He did some scrimmaging work at the practice facility, and Kerr said there were no lingering physical issues from a car accident Friday in which Curry was unharmed.

"LOS ANGELES --  The Orlando Magic had swept the season series against the Los Angeles Lakers once in their first 29 seasons in the NBA. In a span of eight days, the Magic did it for the second time. Nikola Vucevic had 31 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists and Terrence Ross made a go-ahead lay-up with 34 seconds left to help the Magic beat the Lakers 108-104 on Sunday. Ross scored 16 points for the Magic, who won 130-117 at home on Nov. 17. ""We're trying to build something, and wins like these can really help you build some momentum,"" Vucevic said. Ross got to the rim to break the 104-104 deadlock after LeBron James missed a step-back 3-pointer. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed another 3 on the ensuing Lakers possession, and Aaron Gordon got a dunk on the runout to cap off the win. Orlando was able to overcome poor starts in both games, but had to outlast a late charge to hold off Los Angeles this time after a 14-4 run tied the game with 2:24 to play. Gordon had 17 points and D.J. Augustin added 12 points and nine assists for the Magic. James had 24 points and seven assists for the Lakers, who had won three straight games and six of their past seven. Kyle Kuzma scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 17. After falling behind by many as 12 points in the first quarter, the Magic would outscore the Lakers 67-42 during the second and third quarter. Orlando made 51 percent of its shots in that stretch, including 9 of 19 3-pointers. ""It just took time, but we stuck with it and put ourselves in position to win,"" Ross said. Lakers players blamed their inability to protect their lead on a lack of effort. ""Defensively, we kind of broke down and the energy level was a little lower than our expectations, and they took advantage of that,"" James said. ""NIGHTMARE"" NIK Vucevic averaged 33.5 points, 14 rebounds and 3.5 assists against the Lakers this season, living up to Lakers coach Luke Walton's pregame description of the former Southern California star as a ""nightmare to matchup with"" because of the versatility of his offensive game. ""He's got our number this year,"" James said. ""All you can say."" SIMMONS' SPARK Magic coach Steve Clifford credited Jonathon Simmons for helping the team overcome a slow start with his intensity off the bench in the second quarter. Simmons had two points and three assists in the quarter, giving Orlando its first lead of the game on a lay-up with 23 seconds to go before James knocked down a 3 at the buzzer. ""He brought a toughness to our team and the energy level that up until that point we had lacked,"" Clifford said. Simmons finished with 10 points, helping the Magic's bench outscore the Lakers 42-21. TIP-INS Magic: Clifford has not decided whether F Wes Iwundu will remain in the starting lineup when Jonathan Isaac is no longer playing on a minutes restriction. Isaac had six points and five rebounds against the Lakers in his third game back after missing six games because of an ankle injury. ""The challenges of the day are the only things I am worried about,"" Clifford said. Lakers: JaVale McGee finished with 12 points, seven rebounds and seven blocks. McGee and New Orleans C Anthony Davis are the only players in the NBA with at least five blocks in four games this season. . Lance Stephenson had 13 off the bench. . Lonzo Ball had nine points and 10 assists, his second game this season with double-digit assists","401070967"
"DETROIT --  Dwane Casey is a little perplexed by his team's performance in afternoon games. ""We've got to drink some coffee in the morning, wake up a little bit earlier,"" the Detroit coach said. ""Wake up a little bit earlier, have a 6 o'clock-in-the-morning shootaround, something to get us going."" For three quarters Sunday, the Pistons seemed content to trade baskets with lowly Phoenix, but Detroit finally went on a 15-3 run in the fourth and beat the Suns 118-107. Andre Drummond had 19 points and 16 rebounds, and Blake Griffin added 16 points and 11 assists for the Pistons. Devin Booker scored 37 points for Phoenix, and rookie Deandre Ayton had a season-high 25 points with 13 rebounds. Reggie Jackson had 19 points and eight assists for the Pistons. Phoenix forward T.J. Warren was ejected in the second quarter after receiving two technical fouls following an offensive foul that was called against him. ""I'm not going to make any comments about the call, but I think T.J. overreacted and the official had to use his judgment,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""I told him that T.J. is one of the nicest people in the world and that was out of character, but he's judging what is happening in the moment. T.J. can take one, but you can't take two and hurt the team."" The Pistons lost afternoon games against Philadelphiaand Charlotte earlier this month. Sunday's matchup tipped off shortly after 4 p.m. Booker scored 21 points in the first half, but the Pistons led 62-60 after two quarters. It was close throughout the third and still tied at 88 early in the fourth. Then Langston Galloway made a 3-pointer that began Detroit's crucial run. Jackson and Stanley Johnson also made 3s during that stretch. ""It's always tough to win on the road, obviously, but we did some different things to try to keep them off balance a little bit, but then they kind of adjusted,"" Phoenix's Jamal Crawford said. ""From that point, they made shots and our shots became a little bit tougher."" Booker scored the first seven points of the second half for Phoenix, then didn't have a field goal until he made a 3-pointer to end the Detroit run in the fourth. ""There's really no stopping him,"" Johnson said. ""I go out there and try to slow him down and get a little more physical with him."" ON THE LINE Drummond has improved his free throws quite a bit, but he went just 1 for 8 on Sunday, including an airball in the fourth quarter. Phoenix tried fouling him intentionally in the fourth, but the Suns couldn't capitalize on his misses that much. EFFICIENT Ayton came into the game shooting 61 percent from the field, and the rookie big man went 11 of 13 against Detroit. It was his 11th double-double. TIP-INS Suns: Crawford scored 12 points, surpassing 19,000 for his career. ... Booker scored 30-plus points for the fourth time this season. Pistons: Detroit is without G Luke Kennard, who has been recovering from a sprained right shoulder. ... Galloway scored 15 points and Johnson added 14. ... The Pistons have won six of their last eight. ... Detroit tied a season high with 30 assists.","401070968"
"ATLANTA --  John Collins was certain the ball would go to Kemba Walker, so it was just a matter of getting in position to alter his shot. ""We knew he was going to get to a strong right (move) and get to a step-back if he could,"" Collins said. ""He ended up going for the floater, and I timed it perfectly with the game-winning block."" Collins had 23 points and 11 rebounds and swatted away Walker's runner in the lane as time expired, helping the Atlanta Hawks snap a 10-game losing streak with a 124-123 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night. Walker, the NBA's second-leading scorer, hit a jumper to put Charlotte up by one with 48.2 seconds remaining, but he committed a shot-clock turnover on the next possession and finished 7 for 23 from the field for 22 points. Kent Bazemore scored 20 points and hit the go-ahead basket for Atlanta, taking an inbound pass and driving past Dwayne Bacon for a layup with 4.6 seconds to go. ""They didn't really know what we were running,"" Bazemore said. ""Saw an opportunity to get back with my left hand and made a play."" Malik Monk tied a career high with 26 points on seven 3-pointers, and Marvin Williams added a season-high 13 rebounds and chipped in 20 points for the Hornets. ""We're better than this, and I'm not taking anything away from them,"" Williams said. ""Coach preaches to us day after day that we have to protect the rim."" Collins had three hard dunks in the fourth, the last one coming in front of Walker to make it 122-119 with 1:26 remaining. His athletic putback with 2:46 left kept Atlanta leading by two, but his biggest play was stopping Walker in the lane to help the rebuilding Hawks to a rare victory. The Hawks began the game with NBA's worst record and had the league's worst defense during its 10-game skid, allowing an averaging of nearly 117 points. Charlotte was the ninth opponent to score at least 40 in the first quarter against Atlanta. Trae Young finished with 18 points, and the Hawks got 16 each from Taurean Prince and DeAndre' Bembry. Charlotte took its biggest lead at 13 on Bridges' layup in the first minute of the second quarter. The Hawks tied it at 60-all on Prince's 3 at the 2-minute mark. The Hornets were up one entering the third. ""They just flat-out put their heads down and drove right by us,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""The second quarter was all about our poor transition defense."" Walker was just 3 for 14 when he hit a 3 to make it 82-73 midway through the third. The Hawks tied it at 84-all a couple of minutes later when Young fed Collins for a one-handed dunk, and Borrego called timeout. After Walker followed with an airball 3, Collins hit a layup for the Hawks' first lead since midway through the first. Bembry's layup made it 100-92 for Atlanta's biggest lead. The teams took a combined 84 3-point attempts. Walker, Williams and Young each hit four. TIP-INS Hornets: G Tony Parker missed his second straight game with a rib contusion, but Borrego had him in uniform to provide leadership. It's a relationship of mutual respect. Borrego, in his first season with Charlotte, was a San Antonio assistant for 10 seasons of Parker's 17-year career with the Spurs. During an official timeout early in the fourth, Parker was animated as spoke to the players who were headed back to the floor before Borrego and his staff walked over. ... F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist missed his sixth straight game with a right ankle sprain, but Borrego thinks he's close to returning and could play when Charlotte opens a four-game homestand Monday. Kidd-Gilchrist has averaged 8.6 points and 5.9 rebounds in 13 games. Hawks: Rookie G Kevin Huerter made his third start, this time in place of Bazemore, who was listed as questionable with a left ankle sprain. Huerter scored four points in 22 minutes. Bazemore had started every game this season. ""We have a lot of young guys and as a veteran you've got to give yourself up sometimes,"" he said. ""It's a good opportunity to shake things up. We'd been through 19 games, and it just wasn't working. Sacrifice yourself sometimes, and look, the basketball gods took care of me.""","401070969"
"NEW YORK -- Jimmy Butler's new teammates saw him drift to one of his favorite spots on the court and already knew what to expect. Butler made a 3-pointer with 2.3 seconds remaining to give the Philadelphia 76ers a 127-125 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. ""Man, to tell you the truth it could have been anybody,"" the Sixers' recent addition said. ""They do have a lot of confidence in me but I got so much more confidence in those guys. They really got us back in game."" Butler's shot from the right wing, similar to the one that beat Charlotte in overtime on Nov. 17, capped Philadelphia's rally from 20 points down in a game the Nets led nearly all the way. Butler finished with 34 points and 12 rebounds, and Joel Embiid had 32 points and 12 boards for the 76ers, who have won five of their last six games. A game-time decision after spraining his ankle against Cleveland on Friday night, Butler looked fine after he spent Saturday at Villanova's home gym. He hoisted up shots from about 20 different spots, including the same area from where he would go on to make the 76ers a winner. Embiid has grown accustomed to Butler's flair for the dramatic, but knew his new teammate had to rush it a little after Philadelphia inbounded the ball with just 10.2 seconds remaining. ""He kept taking his time and I am like, `Are you going to freaking shoot the ball?"" Embiid said. ""You know, big-time play. He got to his spot and he made a big-time shot."" The Nets shot 57 percent from the field and hit 46 percent beyond the 3-point line to head into the half with a 68-54 lead before the 76ers rallied. D'Angelo Russell had 38 points, his highest total with the Nets, and added eight assists and eight rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 31 points off the bench for Brooklyn, which is just 3-6 at home. ""It's tough, we played 45 minutes of that game and lost it to that one shot, but we gave ourselves a chance,"" Russell said. The 76ers, who are a league-best 10-1 at home, improved to just 4-7 away from the Wells Fargo Center. Butler, whose first game-winner with the Sixers ruined Kemba Walker's 60-point performance in Charlotte, led Philadelphia's fourth-quarter charge after it looked sluggish throughout the first three quarters. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown was equally impressed with Butler's effort when he recovered a loose ball after JJ Reddick had missed a potential go-ahead basket. Brown recalled how Butler made a similar play against the Hornets when he blocked a shot and saved the ball from going out of bounds to set up his game-winner. ""The TVs are going to replay his shot,"" Brown said. ""I hope they go a few seconds earlier and see him dive on the floor and secure a jump ball."" Brooklyn led 118-105 after Dinwiddie's basket with 4:57 left in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia then went on a 16-2 run and went ahead 121-120 on Redick's 3-pointer with 1:03 remaining, its first lead since Embiid scored the game's first two points. Joe Harris answered with a 3 of his own to put the Nets back ahead but Embiid came back on the other end, converting a three-point play after Harris fouled him to give Philadelphia a 124-123 lead. Dinwiddie briefly put Brooklyn back on top with a jumper over Redick, setting the stage for Butler's big shot. The Nets have lost three straight. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid has 18 20-point games this season, second to Kevin Durant's 19. . Philadelphia is 14-8 on the season but 5-2 since acquiring Butler on Nov. 12. .

The 20-year-old is averaging 8.2 points in 19 games this season.","401070970"
"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard delivered his sixth double-double for the surging Toronto Raptors, and added an unusual first, too. Leonard had 29 points and 10 rebounds, Kyle Lowry added 12 points and 10 assists, and the Raptors won their fifth straight game, beating the Miami Heat 125-115 on Sunday night. After going 421 games without one, Leonard picked up the first regular-season technical foul of his career for arguing a non-call on his drive to the basket late in the third quarter. ""It was just kind of getting out of hand with some of the calls out there,"" Leonard said. ""They're doing the best job they can but some of the calls tonight, I felt like I got fouled pretty hard."" Leonard was asked whether he thought his outburst was deserving of a technical foul. ""Definitely,"" he said. ""You work so hard in this game to try and win a game or score the basketball and when you don't get your calls, it's very difficult when someone blatantly fouls you."" Jonas Valanciunas had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Pascal Siakam scored 21 points, two shy of his career high, as the Raptors improved their NBA-leading record to 17-4. Dwyane Wade scored a season-high 35 points, the most ever by a Miami bench player. ""It's a shame that kind of game is wasted on a loss,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Josh Richardson scored 19 points and Bam Adebayo had 16 points and a career-high 21 rebounds, but the Heat lost for the seventh time in nine games. ""The rebounds don't matter unless you come out with a W,"" Adebayo said. Toronto is 11-0 against teams with losing records. Ahead 63-54 at halftime, Toronto opened the third quarter with an 11-3 spurt, leading to a Miami timeout. The Raptors' onslaught continued when play resumed, and Spoelstra was forced to call time again with 7:11 remaining in the period, with his team trailing 88-62. ""That beginning of the third quarter was very uninspiring,"" Spoelstra said. ""Two timeouts and I looked up and it's 26. I was shocked, I couldn't believe how fast it went."" Miami recovered before the end of the quarter, but trailed 101-89 heading to the fourth. The Heat cut the gap to eight points in the final quarter but Toronto used a 7-0 spurt to pull away for good, a sequence that included a three-point play from Siakam and a long 3-pointer by Lowry with the shot clock running out. ""We got down early in the third quarter by too many points to try and come back on the road versus the best team in the Eastern Conference,"" Wade said. Leonard scored 11 points in the first as the Raptors led 36-29, the fifth straight game Toronto has been ahead at the end of the opening quarter. The Raptors are 13-1 when leading after 12 minutes. TIP-INS Heat: G Goran Dragic (right knee) missed his fourth straight game. ... G Tyler Johnson (right hamstring) sat for the third straight game. ... F Justise Winslow played despite being listed as questionable because of a sore right quadriceps. Winslow had nine points in 30 minutes. ... Wade shot 13 for 22, including 4 for 7 from 3-point range. He scored almost half of Miami's 71 bench points. Raptors: Toronto made 15 of 20 field goal attempts in the first. ... Serge Ibaka scored eight points off the bench, failing to reach double figures for the first time in 18 games. It was the second-longest streak of his career. ... Toronto is 11-0 when shooting 50 percent or better from the field. ... The Raptors, who made a season-high 17 3-pointers in Friday's win over Atlanta, shot 11 for 35 from long range against Miami. FOLLOW THE LEADER Leonard responded to comments from former coach Gregg Popovich, who said Saturday that Leonard was not a team leader in San Antonio. ""It's just funny to me because I don't know if he's talking about last year or not, but I guess when you stop playing they forget how you lead,"" Leonard said. PLAYING CAREFUL Miami didn't have a turnover in the first half, the first time in team history the Heat have gone an entire half without turning the ball over. They finished with seven. SHIRT OFF HIS BACK Lowry and Wade swapped jerseys after the game. ""He's a future Hall of Famer,"" an appreciative Lowry said. ""It'll go up in my house. I'll have a couple of stories I can tell to my kids a long time from now.""","401070971"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The entrance to the visitors' locker room was covered with soaked towels, ice cubes scattered across the wet floor, remnants of the successful return to Memphis for New York Knicks coach David Fizdale. One year after Fizdale was fired by the Grizzlies, he returned with his Knicks on Sunday and left with a 103-98 victory. The win -- New York's third straight -- led to a celebration, Fizdale's team dousing him with water -- and ice -- as he entered the locker room after the game. ""You're getting me emotional because I can't put it into words,"" Fizdale said. Enes Kanter had a career-high 26 rebounds and scored 21 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. finished with 22 points. Kanter led a third-quarter rally that erased a 13-point Memphis lead that seemed to predicate a sour return for Fizdale. Emmanuel Mudiay added 17 points, and Trey Burke had 15 to help the Knicks. Marc Gasol led Memphis with 27 points and Mike Conley had 23 points. Jaren Jackson Jr. had 16 points and seven blocks, tying a franchise record for a Grizzlies rookie. Fizdale may have downplayed any real emotions about his return, but his squad was aware of the game's importance. In fact, a poor-shooting first half left the Knicks trailing 52-43 at the break, and leading to a word of advice from Fizdale. ""Coming into halftime, Fizz knew that we had that type of mindset coming into the game,"" Hardaway said. ""He told us at halftime just to calm down and don't make it about him. That's what we were playing for. We were playing for coach."" The third quarter showed a difference in the Knicks mindset. After Memphis built the lead to 13 early in the period, Kanter began asserting his strength inside and on the boards. Kanter muscled his way around the basket for 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting and grabbed 11 rebounds in the frame. New York outscored Memphis 35-19 in the third, including a 23-6 run. ""I want my teammates to shoot it with confidence,"" Kanter said of his rebounding. ""Whenever you miss the shot, I'm going to get the rebound. So, shoot it with confidence."" Despite the third-quarter rally, the two were still tied at 93l with 1:49 left. The Knicks scored the next six points, leading to the celebration for Fizdale. ""I think it was a bunch of things we didn't do,"" said Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who became the interim Grizzlies coach after Fizdale's firing and now has the permanent job. ""That is the most disappointing thing is our guys have lived an identity. In that third quarter, we didn't."" TIP-INS Knicks: Fizdale acknowledged everything was backward when he arrived at FedExForum for the game. ""It was weird,"" he said. ""I pulled in and I'm like `OK, I'm not parking in my spot.' Then he added that Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff was ""in my damn spot."" ... The win snapped a seven-game New York losing streak in Memphis. New York had not defeated the Grizzlies on Memphis' home court since a 110-108 victory on March 9, 2011. .Kanter's previous career-high rebounds was 24 against Chicago on Nov. 15. Grizzlies: Memphis struggled mightily with free throws early, making only 3 of its first 9 in the game. The Grizzlies would end the night 11 of 19 from the line. . Conley converted only 8 of 24 shots, including 2 of 10 from 3-point range. .The Grizzlies had a franchise-record 19 blocks, including Jackson's seven, tying a franchise record in blocks by a rookie. The previous franchise record for blocks was 17 on Nov. 12, 2004 against Golden State. NO ANIMOSITY: NO REGRETS Fizdale's departure was long linked with him not getting along with Gasol, including benching the Grizzlies center in the fourth quarter of the last Memphis game before Fizdale was fired. The Knicks coach said the air was cleared in a summer conversation between the two. ""I credit him with that. He made me a better coach and he made me a better person,"" Fizdale said. ""That's not going to be a story any more for you guys."" Then Fizdale referenced Gasol working on a ship that rescued migrants that capsized off the coast of Libya. ""This guy pulled a migrant out of the ocean this summer. That's way more important than a basketball beef,"" Fizdale said. Gasol and Fizdale hugged each near midcourt after the game. Of the situation, Gasol said after the game, ""It was good. It was a competitive game. We asked about our families. All good.""","401070972"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  A little film study went a long way for Ricky Rubio and helped Utah keep its long winning streak in Sacramento going. Even with leading scorer Donovan Mitchell sitting out with bruised ribs. Rubio scored 23 of his 27 points in the first half, Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 15 rebounds and the Jazz beat the Kings 133-112 on Sunday. ""Any time he can get going he's allowed to do that,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said of Rubio. ""He knew tonight that his scoring was important. He got to the rim as much as anything. I know he made some jumpers but he was attacking the rim and finishing."" Joe Ingles added 18 points, Jae Crowder had 14 and Derrick Favors 11 to help the Jazz snap a three-game losing streak. Four days after losing to the Kings in Salt Lake City, the Jazz bounced back behind a fast start from Rubio then pulled away for their eighth consecutive win in Sacramento. Rubio repeatedly got open looks and made 10 of his first 12 shots to help make up for Mitchell's absence. He finished with five assists and seven rebounds. ""When we were playing against them (Wednesday) I knew their game plan was letting me shoot so I was ready for that,"" Rubio said. ""Plus, Donovan wasn't in the game so I had to be a little more aggressive. We saw the bigs were staying a lot with Rudy so Joe had a couple of layups and everybody attacked the rim harder."" Rubio cooled off in the second half after picking up his fourth foul early in the third quarter but Utah got a big lift from Gobert and Favors to hold on. ""It's not just (Rubio's) scoring,"" Crowder said. ""It's being aggressive, whether it be getting in the paint and finding guys (for) kick-outs or getting in the paint and finding your layups. Once he does that it opens up a lot of stuff for our offense."" Gobert scored 11 of Utah's first 13 points in the third quarter, including a pair of thunderous two-hand dunks in a 60-second span. Favors had seven points early in the fourth and made a big block on a baseline drive. The Kings, playing the second half of a back-to-back, couldn't keep up. Sacramento was sluggish early and trailed by 28 in the second half. It was a far different look for coach Dave Joerger's team, which lost 117-116 at Golden State on Saturday. The Kings were outrebounded 49-36 and went 23 of 31 at the free throw line. ""They were not excited about us tripping them up on their home floor last week,"" Joerger said. ""They came in focused and dialed in."" Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 20 points in his first start this season for Sacramento. Marvin Bagley III added 18 points and six rebounds. BACK-TO-BACK BLUES The Kings seemed to wear down late in the game, something their opponents have done frequently. Playing the second half of a back-to-back was partly to blame, as was Sacramento's high-tempo offense which rarely got in gear. The Kings were held to a season-low 13 fast-break points. ""We had a lot of mistakes, turnovers we don't usually get,"" Bagley said. ""I think everybody was kind of tired from a hard game (Saturday). It was just one of those days."" STATS Sacramento is 0-6 when allowing opponents to shoot 50 percent or better from the floor. . Utah had 30 assists, its third game with 30 or more. . Bagley has reached double figures in scoring in five straight games. TIP-INS Jazz: Rubio took only four shots in the second half. ... Mitchell was injured early in the second quarter of Friday's loss to the Lakers. He appeared fine in the locker room after the game but it's uncertain when he'll play next. Kings: Harry Giles, who sat out all of last season with a knee injury, had his most effective game this season with 10 points, eight rebounds, six assists, four steals and two blocks. ... Sacramento hasn't defeated Utah at home since Dec. 8, 2015. ... Iman Shumpert (load management) and Kosta Koufos (right calf strain) were held out.","401070973"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Few, if any, expected the Los Angeles Clippers to be atop the Western Conference standings 19 games into the season. On Sunday night, they even managed to impress themselves with a 104-100 comeback win over the Portland Trail Blazers. ""Gritty win. This to me may be our best,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We didn't have anything in the first half and we didn't make any adjustments other than we've got to play harder, we've got to play more physical. That's how we have got to play."" Tobias Harris had 34 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Clippers. Danilo Gallinari made the tiebreaking jumper with 47 seconds left and added 17 points. ""Just keep fighting,"" Harris said of the Clippers' mentality at halftime. ""We have a group of guys who want to win, who want to prove ourselves that we can close out games and win."" Damian Lillard scored 30 points for Portland, which led by 13 at halftime but then had to play the second half without starting center Jusuf Nurkic because of a bruised shoulder. ""Losing Nurkic hurts them, there's no doubt about it,"" Rivers said. ""He was playing so well for them. We're not mad about that, but it definitely hurt them."" With Portland missing its defensive anchor, the Clippers began the half on a 20-4 run. The Clippers kept the momentum going, outscoring the Blazers 38-16 in the third quarter. ""The third quarter was very disappointing,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. With the game slipping away, Stotts left Lillard in the game to start the fourth quarter, and the star guard's personal 7-0 run in a span of 12 seconds tied it at 100 with 1:53 left. ""Lillard got those two (3s) at the end that I thought I was gonna die over,"" Rivers said. ""We were trying to trap and we slipped and messed up twice and he makes two. That's just how good he is."" But Gallinari made a short pull-up jumper moments later, Portland missed a couple jumpers on the next possession and Patrick Beverley clinched it with a pair of free throws after a botched rebound by the Blazers. The loss ruined Maurice Harkless' first start of the season. He had returned Wednesday from a knee injury that kept him out since Oct. 29. WILD, WILD WEST After Sunday's games, only 3  1/2 games separated first place from 11th in the West. Both coaches don't think the competition is going anywhere. ""I don't see that changing much throughout the year,"" Stotts said. ""There's so much parity when you look at teams that weren't even predicted to be that strong. Sacramento is playing good ball. Every night is going to be a challenge in the West. If you start watching the standings now, it's not good."" Rivers agreed, with one exception. ""It's not normal because Golden State's not No. 1. That's not normal,"" Rivers said.  ""When you play in the West it feels like you don't have a night when you take a breather. You have to play and compete and we beat each other's brains out and then you have another one the next night. But the good news is everyone accepts that in the West and hopefully that makes us all better."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles improved to 13-6, the best record in the Western Conference. The Clippers have done it with a roster absent of household names, but depth is the reason they are where they are. ""You have seven or eight guys that can start and they do,"" Rivers said. ""We move it around. But as long as your group is good with that and the changes and we have good group."" Trail Blazers: After a strong start to the season, the Blazers sputtered in the last two games of their road trip, losing by a combined 71 points. The defense, which was at one point in the top five in the league, has fallen to 16th in defensive efficiency. ""We've had three relatively poor defensive games, two of them against very good offensive teams,"" Stotts said before the game. ""I am concerned. It's not a trend I want to continue. Milwaukee was a train wreck.""","401070974"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist's stat line was nothing to get excited about: seven points, seven rebounds, two blocks and one assist. But the forward's return to the floor after missing six games with an ankle injury provided a huge spark for the Charlotte Hornets, who built a 25-point, third-quarter lead and held on to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 110-107 on Monday night to snap a two-game losing streak. Kidd-Gilchrist brought energy on both ends of the floor, including a rejection of Khris Middleton off the glass on a fast-break layup attempt. Charlotte forced 16 turnovers, limited Milwaukee to a season-low 40 points in the paint and played perhaps its best defensive game of the season. ""He's special on that end of the floor,"" Kemba Walker said of Kidd-Gilchrist's defense. ""He takes pride in it. ... We missed him. He came in and gave an unbelievable effort. He's still not 100 percent, but the effort that he gave was just unbelievable."" Kidd-Gilchrist said it was ""not fun"" to sit out six games, saying he had a lot of energy bottled up inside of him. ""The energy is why I'm here,"" Kidd-Gilchrist said. Coach James Borrego praised his team's defense one night after an ugly loss at Atlanta, which has the worst record in the Eastern Conference. He said Kidd-Gilchrist provided the spark the Hornets needed. ""We have felt his absence the last four or five games,"" Borrego said. ""I don't think it's a coincidence that we have that type of effort tonight with him back in the lineup."" Walker and Jeremy Lamb shared the scoring load for the Hornets, each finishing with 21 points. Marvin Williams added 16 points and eight rebounds, and Tony Parker returned from a two-game absence and had 15 points off the bench for the Hornets. The Bucks nearly came all the way back, cutting the lead to one with 17 seconds left on a layup by Giannis Antetokounmpo. But Walker made two free throws with 7.1 seconds remaining and the Bucks failed to get off a good shot after a side inbounds, with Eric Bledsoe forced to launch an off-balance 3-pointer that hit off the glass and the rim and bounced away as time expired. Antetokounmpo had 20 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists. Bledsoe scored 17 points. TIP-INS Bucks: Were 7-of-9 on 3-pointers in the game's first 5  1/2 minutes to build a 28-14 lead. Hornets: Lamb has scored at least 18 points in six of his last seven games. ... After spotting the Bucks a 28-14 lead in the first quarter, the Hornets outscored the Bucks 57-24 over the next 22 minutes behind a 3-point barrage led by Lamb and Williams. TURNOVERS The Bucks looked sloppy and disorganized on offense for most of the game and struggled making shots in the final two minutes. ""For two-and-a-half quarters we were not able to match them,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I am proud of the group for finding a way to fight back. We had a bunch of chances late and just couldn't quite convert."" PARKER'S IMPACT Parker's return was big for Charlotte, allowing Walker to take a breather down the stretch and play off the ball while Parker ran the offense. Borrego said Parker, who made two big shots late in the fourth quarter after the Bucks had closed the lead to four, provided a ""calming influence"" down the stretch. ""Having Tony back just steadies us,"" Borrego said. ""He's a winner. He's been a winner his entire career. He helped us close that game out."" Said Bucks center Brook Lopez: ""He's been doing that his whole career, for a long time. He's always ready, always prepared to go. He definitely came through when they needed him to.""","401070975"
"CLEVELAND --  There's no question the Minnesota Timberwolves have been better since trading disgruntled star Jimmy Butler. Monday night's 102-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers improved Minnesota's record to 6-2 since the trade two weeks ago that sent Butler to Philadelphia. The victory moved Minnesota within a game of .500. The Timberwolves haven't been at the break-even mark since the fourth game of the season. ""We have a long way to go, but we keep improving,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We're still not playing as well as we can. We can't be satisfied."" Robert Covington, one of three players acquired in the Butler trade, scored 24 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 21, giving Minnesota its second win in 10 road games this season. Covington bounced back from a horrendous game Saturday against Chicago in which he scored four points, was 1 of 18 from the field and missed all 10 of his 3-point attempts. He was 8 of 12 from the field and hit 4 of 7 3-pointers Monday. ""The second that clock hit zero (Saturday), that game was out of my mind,"" Covington said. ""That's what happens when you're a shooter."" Derrick Rose came off the bench to score 10 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter. Towns hit two baskets in the final two minutes, including a fadeaway jumper on the baseline, after Cleveland cut the lead to 91-86. Cleveland beat Philadelphia and Houston last week for its first back-to-back wins of the season, but couldn't make it three straight. Kyle Korver scored 22 points, including six 3-pointers for Cleveland. Rodney Hood added 20 points while Tristan Thompson had 16 points and 11 rebounds. Cleveland shot 8 of 21 and committed five turnovers in the fourth quarter. Hood thought the lack of ball movement down the stretch was a key factor. ""We get stagnant and then it turns into -- I don't want to say bad basketball -- but it makes it tougher for us to score,"" he said. Towns turned in a highlight-worthy play in the second quarter. The 7-footer picked up an errant pass from Larry Nance Jr. near midcourt, drove around two defenders in the lane and scored on a thunderous dunk. Andrew Wiggins scored 11 points after going 0 for 12 from the field and being held scoreless Saturday. Wiggins was 4 of 11 from the field. The Timberwolves led 75-71 heading into the final period after the Cavaliers cut into a 12-point deficit. Rose hit three baskets and assisted on Covington's 3-pointer, pushing the lead to 86-74 and prompting Cleveland coach Larry Drew to call timeout with 8:26 to play. Cleveland rallied again and cut the lead to 88-84 with five minutes to play, but Rose scored in the lane and Towns hit his two big baskets. Rose played 16 games with Cleveland last season, but battled injuries and was traded in February. HUGE NUMBERS Drew is a big fan of Towns, who is averaging 20.8 points and shooting 49 percent from the field. He also averages 12.1 rebounds and had 10 boards Monday. Towns has made 39 of his 96 3-point attempts. ""He's now shooting it from the 3,"" Drew said ""He's got a good mid-range game. He can put it on the floor. He's a terrific passer. For a big man he has a tremendous feel for the game. Every game it seems like he gets better and better."" TOUGH STRETCH Minnesota finished a stretch of three games in three cities over four nights. ""Tonight was a grinding game,"" Rose said. ""Tonight felt like a back-to-back-to-back. We were tired, to be honest. It builds your character as a team."" STILL LEARNING Rookie Collin Sexton, taken by the Cavaliers with the No. 8 pick in the draft, scored 11 points but was 5 of 19 from the field, with four assists and four turnovers. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jeff Teague was the fifth player in double figures with 13 points. ... Thibodeau was hit with a technical foul with 24 seconds left in the game. ... Minnesota started 3 of 10 from the field and the first basket was Covington's 18-foot bank shot. Cavaliers: F David Nwaba was out with a sore right knee after starting the previous four games.

G George Hill (sprained right shoulder) has begun contact drills during on-court workouts.","401070976"
"WASHINGTON --  Even the Wizards seemed surprised by the way they won. Bradley Beal said he couldn't have imagined allowing the opposing starting guards to combine for 90 points and still get a victory. ""No sir. Absolutely not. No sir,"" Beal said. ""Not at all. It's amazing we pulled it off still."" John Wall scored a season-high 36 points, including six in overtime, and Washington overcame James Harden's season-best 54 points to outlast the Houston Rockets 135-131 on Monday night. Harden, the NBA's leading scorer, also had 13 assists, while Eric Gordon added a season-high 36 points. Wall had two baskets in the extra period and finished with 11 assists. Beal equaled his season high with 32 points for the Wizards. Otto Porter hit a runner with 4:37 to play for the first basket in overtime and the Wizards remained ahead from there. Wall followed with a jumper to make it 129-125 and later made another jumper that pushed the lead to five. Beal's dunk extended it to 133-126 with 1:50 to play. Harden had 44 points through three quarters but missed five of his seven shots in the fourth. In overtime, Harden whose career high is 60, was 1 of 2 from the field and had two free throws. He had 11 turnovers, three in overtime, and 13 assists. ""It's not even about myself,"" Harden said. ""It's about our entire team. We had a really good start to the game and kind of let our guard down."" Harden scored 12 points in the first quarter, 11 in the second and 21 points in the third quarter. In the fourth, he began the quarter on the bench, and scored six as the Wizards and Rockets headed to overtime with the score knotted at 125. Houston raced to a 27-10 lead, but Washington clawed its way back. Markieff Morris had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards. Clint Capela had 17 points and 14 points for the short-handed Rockets, who played without Chris Paul for the second straight game and fell to 9-10. TIP-INS Rockets: Paul was listed as being out with a sore left leg, though coach Mike D'Antoni classified the injury differently. ""We've just got to make sure Chris gets 100 percent well from his strained hammy,"" D'Antoni said. ... G/F Gerald Green missed his third game with a sore right ankle. ... Houston added F Danuel House from the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the G League. ... Made their first seven 3-point shots, then missed 10 straight. Wizards: C Dwight Howard was out for the fourth straight game with a glute injury. ""It's a slow process,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""He's doing everything he can."" . Morris, F Kelly Oubre Jr. and Beal picked up technicals. ... Allowed 42 points in the first quarter, the fifth time this year they'd given up at least 40. ... Wall passed Wes Unseld for third place on the franchise career scoring list. GUARDING HARDEN Wall said that despite allowing 54 points to Harden, Beal did a fine job against him. ""It's what you dream of,"" Wall said. ""It's what you live for, to be on the big stage, a big moment, going against a guy like that."" COACHING HARDEN D'Antoni knows he's asking too much of Harden, who played a season-high 47 minutes. ""I mean, we're asking, especially James, you know what? Play (47) minutes, make every play,"" D'Antoni said. ""There are going to be periods where he's just gassed."" HURT ROCKETS Besides Paul and Green, the Rockets are without G Brandon Knight (left knee), C Nene (right calf) and F/C Zhou Qui. Knight and Nene haven't played at all this season, and Qui has played one minute. It hasn't gotten Gordon down. ""We definitely want to turn it into a wins,"" Gordon said. ""We're not discouraged. We're going to get this thing rolling here soon.""","401070977"
"CHICAGO --  LaMarcus Aldridge showed off his smooth low-post game in the fourth quarter. He even threw down an impressive dunk for good measure. Aldridge scored 11 of his 20 points in the final period, and the San Antonio Spurs held off the Chicago Bulls for a 108-107 victory on Monday night. ""I just got touches,"" Aldridge said. ""I touched it a little bit more and kind of found my rhythm and once I felt good I was trying to keep going."" DeMar DeRozan had 21 points for San Antonio, and Patty Mills finished with 17. Bryn Forbes made three of the Spurs' 10 3-pointers on his way to 13 points. San Antonio had dropped three of four, including a 135-129 loss at Milwaukee on Saturday. But the Spurs bounced back behind the clutch play of Aldridge and DeRozan. ""I like the fact that DeMar and L.A. got aggressive down the stretch and took over,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. Chicago had two chances to go in front in the final seconds and came up empty each time. Zach LaVine was short on a long 3-point try from the top of the key. Ryan Arcidiacono then stole Forbes' inbounds pass and missed a jumper as time expired. ""It was just a tough way to end the game,"" Arcidiacono said. LaVine scored 11 of his 28 points in the fourth, but the Bulls lost for the seventh time in eight games. Arcidiacono finished with a career-high 22 points, and Jabari Parker had 18 points and 10 rebounds. LaVine also had eight rebounds, seven assists and six of Chicago's 11 turnovers. Asked about settling for the long 3 in the final seconds of a one-point game, LaVine sounded as if he had no regrets. ""If I make it, different result. If I don't, it's a bad shot,"" he said. ""But I don't care. I think I can make it and I will make it in the future."" LaVine's two foul shots gave Chicago a 101-98 lead with 5:58 left, but San Antonio responded with a 10-0 run. Aldridge started the decisive sequence with a fadeaway jumper. Derrick White made a go-ahead 3-pointer and DeRozan had a slick reverse layup before Aldridge punctuated the spurt with a three-point play on a drive and jam with 2:13 remaining. DeRozan said Aldridge's move reminded him of the big man's college days at Texas, but Aldridge wasn't ready to go that far. ""I wouldn't say that,"" a chuckling Aldridge said, ""but definitely a younger me. But I felt good tonight and just made it happen."" BENCH PLAY San Antonio's reserves finished with 44 points, compared to 14 for Chicago's backups. Mills was 7 for 10 from the field and Jakob Poeltl had 10 points on 5-for-5 shooting. ""They saved us again,"" Popovich said. ""The second unit has been great."" TIP-INS Spurs: It was DeRozan's 16th game this season with at least 20 points. ... San Antonio earned its fourth straight win against Chicago. Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen (sprained right elbow) has been cleared to ""fully participate in practice"" on Tuesday, coach Fred Hoiberg said. If that goes well, a timeline for Markkanen's return could come into focus. ""Hopefully he feels great and keeps making progress and we can get him out on the floor soon,"" Hoiberg said. ... G Kris Dunn (left MCL sprain) and F Bobby Portis (right MCL sprain) could participate in the non-contact portions of practice on Tuesday. ""So they're going to kind of get on the same path as what Lauri has gone through the last couple of weeks, to start integrating themselves back into the team,"" Hoiberg said. ... Rookie F Chandler Hutchison returned after missing three games because of back spasms.","401070978"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis had just trimmed New Orleans' deficit to a seemingly surmountable seven points when Boston's Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum combined to quickly squash any notion of a comeback. Irving closed out a 26-point, 10-assist performance with a 3-pointer and a tough baseline fade over Davis, and the Celtics pulled away late for a 124-107 victory over the Pelicans on Monday night. Tatum, who scored 20, threw down a right-handed dunk while being fouled by Davis with 2:26 left, at which point Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry began subbing out starters and fans started filing out, resigned to just New Orleans' second loss in 10 home games this season. ""It's closing time at that point,"" Irving said. ""We knew that we had the game in control just based upon our defensive schemes that we had out there. ""At winning time like that, I have the confidence in my teammates and confidence in my coaching staff to make the right plays and seek out the mismatches that we want,"" Irving added. Davis finished with 27 points, 16 rebounds and three blocks, Nikola Mirotic hit six 3s as part of his 25 points, and Julius Randle added 15 points from the bench, but that wasn't enough to end what is now a four-game losing streak for New Orleans. Al Horford scored 20 points, and Marcus Morris had 19 points and 11 rebounds for Boston, which punished the Pelicans for their 22 turnovers, converting them into 32 points. ""That's how we're used to playing. That's the team we know,"" Boston guard Marcus Smart said.  ""We had different guys diving on the floor and doing multiple things on the defensive end."" Irving had five steals, while Tatum and Horford each had three. ""We knew most of their plays and contested and used our length to our advantage,"" Irving said. ""When we're playing at that type of level, then we're tough to beat, because offensively it'll take care of itself. ... It felt good tonight to win like that because that's who we are."" The Celtics put up 39 3s, hitting 19, a statistic that Gentry thought was as telling as his team's turnovers. ""It started with turnovers, but we gave up too many uncontested 3s,"" Gentry said. ""This team is a great 3-point shooting team anyway, so their bigs can shoot them, their perimeter guys can shoot them, and every time we got it within a workable distance, it was either a turnover or they made a 3."" TIP-INS Celtics: Terry Rozier scored 14 points. He also was assessed a technical foul in the second quarter after he tossed the ball away during a stoppage. ... Boston outscored New Orleans 42-34 in the paint. ... The Celtics improved to 6-7 on the road. Pelicans: Jrue Holiday scored 13 points but also finished with eight turnovers. ... Forward Solomon Hill saw action for the first time since Nov. 1. He saw no playing time in 12 straight games before his 20 minutes against Boston. He had four rebounds, two points and an assist. ... New Orleans was 27 of 29 on three throws, but went 12 of 32 from 3. SETTING THE TONE New Orleans trailed nearly the entire game, falling behind early because of eight first-quarter turnovers that led to 11 Celtics points. Holiday, playing point guard instead of shooting guard while Elfrid Payton sits out with a broken finger, turned ball over five times in the opening period. The Celtics opened up their largest lead with an 11-0 run that began with three straight three-point possessions: Irving's floater in the lane as he was fouled, Irving's 3-pointer and Tatum's driving layup while being fouled. Rozier's layup capped the burst and made it 80-60 midway through the third quarter. Soon after, Randle's free throws and Darius Miller's 3 ignited an 11-2 Pelicans run to close the period, trimming Boston's lead to 10 heading to the fourth. Davis scored five straight points on a short fade as he was fouled and a pair of free throws to cut it to 93-87 with nearly nine minutes to play. But Boston never let it get closer than that.","401070979"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Myles Turner missed Indiana's last game with a sore ankle. He returned with a rested body and renewed determination against Utah. ""Sitting the San Antonio game was hard but it was the best thing for me,"" Turner said. ""I was aggressive tonight on offense and defense."" Turner scored all of his 16 points in the first three quarters and helped limit Rudy Gobert's effectiveness as the Pacers rolled to an easy victory without Victor Oladipo, beating the Jazz 121-88 on Monday night. ""I lured him from the paint. He's a shot-blocker and it opens the lane for our attacking guards and we got more for everybody else,"" said Turner, who didn't play in the fourth quarter. Doug McDermott scored a season-high 21 points to help replace the 21.4 averaged by Oladipo, who missed his fourth game with a sore right knee. ""I got in a rhythm early, moving around without the ball,"" McDermott said. ""The ball was moving side to side. It wasn't sticking at all."" Seven Pacers reached double figures. Tyreke Evans scored 14 points and Cory Joseph and Domantas Sabonis each had 13. The Pacers shot a season-best 58.3 percent and made half of their 18 3-point attempts. Donovan Mitchell, who scores 20.6 per game, sat out his second game with bruised ribs and Utah was playing a back-to-back, but it was 19 turnovers and poor shooting that buried the Jazz and dropped their usually stellar home record to 2-6. Derrick Favors scored 13 points, Gobert had 12 and Joe Ingles scored 10. ""We can't wait until we're 19-and-whatever-the-hell-we-were last year to decide to wake up and start playing. We've got an opportunity to do it early and now,"" Ingles said, referring to Utah's turnaround last season, which ended with a 29-6 finish. But they need to tighten up the basics. The Jazz repeatedly tried to dribble through the Pacers' tenacious defense or pass over their outstretched hands. Even Utah's traditionally supportive crowd booed at times as Utah's turnovers led to 25 Indiana points. ""Right from the start, we established ourselves defensively,"" said Indiana coach Nate McMillan, whose players tied a season high with 13 steals. If the Jazz got past the ball pressure, Turner was there to turn away drives in the lane. On offense, the Pacer center made his first five shots, mostly on mid-range jumpers off pick-and-pop actions. Turner signed a four-year, $72 million extension in the offseason and the big man from Texas went to work earning it, dropping fat, gaining muscle and improving his shot during the summer. After a four-game stretch where he didn't score more than nine points, Turner has reached double figures in five consecutive games. ""This is how I should be playing every night. I'm going to miss some shots and make some shots but that can't determine the way I play out there. I've got to bring it,"" Turner said. Turner scored 11 points in the first half to help Indiana take a 58-47 lead. The Jazz have lost six of eight. TIP-INS Pacers: The Pacers beat the Jazz 121-94 last Monday. ""Our two most complete wins are both against the Jazz,"" McDermott said. ... Indiana is 8-0 when making at least half its field goal attempts. ... The Pacers had their largest margin of victory this season and their first 30-point-plus win on the road in 22 years. Jazz: Ricky Rubio had 23 points on 10-of-13 shooting on Sunday against Sacramento but just three points on 1-of-6 shooting against the Pacers, typical of his up-and-down season. ... Thabo Sefolosha and Ingles both got technical fouls. ... Utah went 8 for 31 on 3s. GOOD START The Pacers have three more games on this road trip and it's not certain when Oladipo, who is traveling with the team, may return. A big win in the initial game set a good tone. ""It's very important,"" Joseph said. ""We know it's tough coming out to Utah and playing in this building, so we came out with a lot of energy, determined to get this first one."" KEEP WORKING? No one seems to know why the Jazz are playing below all expectations. Even Utah coach Quin Snyder was at a loss after the game. He repeated the phrase ""got to keep working"" several times and said, ""There's no one thing you point to. We just have to play better ... keep grinding until we play better.""","401070980"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Ever the perfectionist and competitor, Kevin Durant knows he should have scored well more than 50 points if a few more shots had fallen. ""I'm pretty sure all my teammates felt that way,"" the typically efficient Golden State star said. Durant scored a season-high 49 points, giving Golden State the lead on a three-point play with 1:19 left before hitting a 3-pointer with 22 seconds remaining to send the Warriors past the Orlando Magic, 116-110 on Monday night. ""I still missed 17 shots. I tricked off a 50-piece. I felt like I had some shots that I wish I could have made last game and this game,"" Durant said. ""I could be in a better groove I feel like. Just playing a lot of minutes and having the ball in your hands, especially with the way the game is, the flow of the game. Obviously if you can score a little bit, you're going to score some points in this league."" Durant topped his 44-point performance two nights earlier with another brilliant outing on both ends, even if he didn't like shooting 16 for 33. Klay Thompson was his scoring sidekick once more as the two-time defending NBA champions played without injured All-Stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Thompson hit his sixth 3 of the night to tie it with 1:45 left and finished with 29 points. The past three games, Durant has scored 125 points and Thompson 91. ""It was hard to stop them. That's why they're such great players,"" Orlando's Nikola Vucevic said. ""They made shot after shot at the end."" Durant became the seventh player in Warriors history to post consecutive 40-point games -- along with Rick Barry, Wilt Chamberlain, Curry, Antawn Jamison, Purvis Short and Thompson, according to Elias. Vucevic had 30 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for the Magic, who were coming off a victory at the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. Durant also had nine assists, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks, having taken his defense to another level the past week. He and Thompson have carried the load as the Warriors won a third straight following a rare four-game losing streak. Golden State closed the third on a 12-2 run to pull within 83-79 heading into the final 12 minutes. Mo Bamba's 3 with 10:35 to go gave the Magic an 88-79 lead before Thompson answered from deep the next two possessions. Quinn Cook, starting in place of Curry, contributed eight points, six rebounds and four assists as Golden State concluded a four-game homestand by beating the Magic for the 11th straight time -- the Warriors' second-longest active streak against an opponent after 16 wins in a row against Phoenix. The Warriors shot just 4 for 15 from 3-point range in the first half and fell behind 64-47 at the break. They hope two-time MVP Curry will return at some point during their upcoming five-game road trip. Curry missed his 11th straight game with a strained left groin, while Green sat out a sixth in a row and eighth in all with a sprained right toe. Evan Fournier made four of his first six shots then missed his final eight for Orlando. CURRY UPDATE Curry scrimmaged Monday and is scheduled to go through a full practice Tuesday, making it possible he could play Thursday at Toronto. ""He might,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Curry was hurt Nov. 8 against the Bucks trying to contest a shot in transition by Eric Bledsoe. ""Steph looked good today. Totally dominated the film crew,"" Kerr quipped. ""They couldn't guard him. (Assistant) Willie Green put up a pretty good fight, but he's a couple of years past his prime."" TIP-INS Magic: Aaron Gordon began 0 for 6 then left in the third with lower back tightness and didn't return. ... The Magic are 2-2 on the road vs. the West. ... Orlando hasn't beaten the Warriors since Dec. 14, 2012, and not in Oakland since Dec. 3 that same year. Warriors: Durant is 29 of 30 from the free throw line the past two games. ""I'm trying to stay over 90 this year. Hopefully my 3-point percentage comes up, too.""... Golden State is 7-1 against the Eastern Conference this season. ... The Warriors won their sixth straight at home vs. Orlando. ... Green was limited to conditioning work Monday and rode the bike. He needs to be on the court a couple of times before Kerr is ready to put him back in a game. ... Key reserve Alfonzo McKinnie was sidelined a sixth consecutive game.","401070981"
"DETROIT --  There's plenty of mediocrity in the Eastern Conference this season, and the Detroit Pistons are taking advantage. Blake Griffin scored 30 points and Stanley Johnson added 21 to lift the Pistons to a 115-108 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night. Reggie Jackson contributed 21 points for Detroit. The Pistons held New York to 40 percent shooting from the field and led throughout the final three quarters. The Pistons (11-7) are off to a solid start under new coach Dwane Casey. Nine of their victories -- including Tuesday's -- have been against teams that currently have losing records, but they all count. ""We have to prove to our fans who we are and what we are, and make sure they are trusting to spend their hard-earned money,"" Casey said after another game in front of a sparse crowd in Detroit. ""I do know that if you're a basketball fan, we do play a brand of basketball that is a winning brand. We're not a finished product."" Allonzo Trier scored 24 points for the Knicks, who had won a season-high three in a row. The Knicks (7-15) took an early 13-5 lead, but Detroit was up 24-19 at the end of the first quarter, and the Pistons never relinquished the lead. ""I thought we came out great, and then we hit 17 points and everything just stalled for whatever reason,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. New York shot 15 of 50 in the first half and trailed by as many as 16 points in the second quarter. It was 51-43 at the half, and the Pistons stretched the lead back as high as 18 in the fourth. The Knicks had the deficit down to seven when Johnson came leaping from behind to block Trier's layup attempt with about 30 seconds to play in the game. TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS Detroit's wins this season have come against Brooklyn, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland (twice), Orlando, Atlanta, Toronto, Houston, Phoenix and New York. The Pistons are in a tight race with Indiana for the fourth-best record in the East. REUNION New York's Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke and Detroit's Glenn Robinson III were teammates on Michigan's 2013 Final Four team. It wasn't a great night for that trio, which combined to shoot 6 of 24 from the field. Hardaway did have 19 points and Burke scored six. Robinson had one point in 11:07 of playing time. ""I wish he could have played more,"" Hardaway said. ""It was great just to have him out there on the floor."" WHISTLES Mitchell Robinson, New York's 7-foot-1 rookie, fouled out with 3:27 remaining in the third quarter after having only two fouls at halftime. Noah Vonleh of the Knicks also fouled out with 2:29 to go in the fourth, and Mario Hezonja picked up his sixth foul in the final minute. Detroit went 32 of 45 on free throws and New York was 27 of 32. ""I thought tonight was at least pretty consistent,"" Griffin said. ""Both ends, there was a lot of fouls called."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York was without F-C Kristaps Porzingis (left knee), G Courtney Lee (neck) and F Lance Thomas (left knee). ... Damyean Dotson, who didn't play at all in the previous four games, played only a few seconds in the first half Tuesday. Then he came out and scored 17 points in the second. Pistons: Detroit was missing G Luke Kennard (right shoulder).","401070982"
"MIAMI --  Josh Richardson took the last pass from Dwyane Wade, then wound up taking a wide-open 3-pointer that would have been a game-winner. Like everything else this season for Miami, the last shot didn't go according to plan. Richardson's shot bounced off the front of the rim with less than 2 seconds remaining, time ran out on the Heat and the Atlanta Hawks -- who wasted every bit of a 19-point, second-half lead -- escaped from Miami with a 115-113 win on Tuesday night. ""Just kind of went our way,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said after his team snapped a seven-game road slide. ""But we'll take it."" Taurean Prince scored 18 points, Trae Young finished with 17 points and 10 assists, and John Collins added 16 points for the Hawks. Atlanta is 2-0 against Miami this season, and 3-16 against everyone else. Richardson led Miami with 22 points. Wade scored 18 and Wayne Ellington added 15 for the Heat, who have lost six straight at home. It's only the 10th time in the 31 years of Heat basketball that Miami has lost so many consecutive games at home. ""Right now, we're between the hammer and the anvil,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""This is the NBA. If you expect it just to be easy, you've been led down the wrong road. This is not what we would like but this is when you start to develop some character."" Bam Adebayo scored 12 for Miami, which got 11 apiece from Justise Winslow and Hassan Whiteside. Atlanta led by 19 early in the second half and was still up by 13 with 8:50 left, before Miami went on a 14-0 run to grab the lead -- a spurt where Richardson scored seven of those points, including a follow shot with 5:04 left to cap the flurry. Atlanta answered with a 7-0 run, and Miami then scored five straight to get back within one. Prince made the second of two free throws with 14 seconds left, giving Atlanta a 115-113 lead. Miami took its final timeout, set up a play with no fewer than four options -- Atlanta took away the first three -- and Wade passed up what would have been a contested jumper to send the ball to Richardson for the wide-open look. ""I think it ended the right way,"" Young said. Miami scored a season-high 38 points in the first quarter, and followed that with a 14-point clunkfest in the second as the Hawks took control. Atlanta outscored Miami by 19 points in the second quarter. A 3-pointer by Kent Bazemore beat the halftime buzzer and Atlanta went into the break with its biggest halftime lead of the season, 68-52. That quarter was far more damning than Richardson's miss at the end. ""We had one of those lulls ... and it cost us the game,"" Richardson said. TIP-INS Hawks: Vince Carter, who went through shootaround in the morning and warmed up pregame -- with a 360-degree dunk as part of that warmup -- didn't play. He's been held out of the last two Hawks games. ... Young connected on a 33-footer in the third quarter, which has sort of become his thing. He's got 10 makes from 30 feet or deeper already this season. Heat: For the first time in team history, Miami allowed 100 points through three quarters in back-to-back games. The Heat trailed Toronto 101-89 after three on Sunday, and were down 100-86 going into the fourth against the Hawks. ... Whiteside was 1 for 7 from the foul line, and the Heat had 20 turnovers turned into 26 Atlanta points. INJURY WATCH Miami was again without All-Star point guard Goran Dragic (right knee) and guard Tyler Johnson (right hamstring). Atlanta was missing guard Tyler Dorsey (left ankle), though he could rejoin the club in Charlotte on Wednesday. Kevin Huerter started for Atlanta for the fourth time this season, after dealing with an aching back throughout the day. WADE TRIBUTE Tuesday was the 11th anniversary of a dark day in Miami sports history, the slaying of University of Miami and Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor. Wade paid tribute to Taylor on his game sneakers, scrawling ""RIP Sean Taylor"" on them.","401070983"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Toronto Raptors were teetering on the edge of their winning streak ending, facing a 17-point, second-half deficit. A 3-point shooting show erased any worries. The Raptors converted 10 of 17 shots from outside the arc in the second half, including 7 of 12 in the fourth to pull away from the Memphis Grizzlies for a 122-114 victory on Tuesday night. ""We had a real gut check at halftime there,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said after Toronto trailed 71-59 at the break. ""We weren't really doing the things that we wanted to do, and then we came out and played a lot better in the second half."" Kyle Lowry had 24 points and six assists, and Fred VanVleet added 18 points to lead the Raptors. VanVleet made all six shots on the night, including three from outside the arc in the fourth. ""We know I haven't been shooting the ball well,"" VanVleet said. ""That's no secret. So, to get back on track a little bit is always fun."" Kawhi Leonard finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Serge Ibaka scored 16 points as the Raptors won their sixth straight and maintained the best record in the NBA (18-4). The loss marked the second time in two games that Memphis lost a double-digit lead early in the third by allowing its opponents to dominate after halftime. The Grizzlies squandered a 13-point lead in their loss to the New York Knicks on Sunday. ""They put a ton of pressure on you. Their style won the fight,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of the Raptors, later adding: ""I think we got rushed to be honest with you. They turned up their defensive pressure and we got sped up. Again, we play a certain style, and we weren't comfortable with some of the shots because they were rushed."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 27 points, making 10 of his 14 shots. Mike Conley added 20 points and six assists. The barrage of 3-pointers from Toronto in the middle stages of the fourth keyed a 17-2 burst. The Raptors would never trail again. The Raptors steadily cut into the deficit in the second half before the 3-point shooting display. Three straight 3-pointers from OG Anunoby, Delon Wright and VanVleet, pulled the Raptors even at 105-all near the midway point of the fourth. ""I felt like we didn't play defense at all,"" Grizzlies guard Shelvin Mack said. ""Even in the first half, giving up 59 points in a half is unlike us. .Scoring 71 points, you get kind of disguised about how bad we were defensively."" TIP-INS Raptors: Jonas Valanciunas came off the bench for the seventh time this season. ... Memphis led 32-31 after the first quarter, breaking a string of five straight games where Toronto led after the first. ... Both Ibaka and coach Nick Nurse drew technical fouls in the last two minutes of the second quarter. ... Toronto has won four straight and six of seven in the series. Grizzlies: Jaren Jackson Jr. became the fourth player in NBA history with at least 250 points, 20 steals, and 40 blocks in first 20 career games. The other three were David Robinson, Bill Walton and Patrick Ewing. ... Lost consecutive home games for the first time this season. ... Lost their third straight, the longest skid of the season.

"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets have never been better against the Lakers. Paul Millsap, Jamal Murray and Malik Beasley scored 20 points apiece, and the Nuggets rolled to their most lopsided victory ever over Los Angeles, a 117-85 rout on Tuesday night. The 32-point margin surpassed a 29-point win in 1993. ""I thought we came out and just took it to them,"" Millsap said. ""Our halfcourt defense was tremendous. We were not allowing them to get any shots. We could have done a little better job of shutting them down in the paint but overall I think we did a really good job of coming in and establishing what we wanted to do, paying attention to the game plan. And it completely took them out of their game."" Nikola Jokic added 14 points and Juancho Hernangomez had 12 for the Nuggets, who won their fourth in a row. Kyle Kuzma scored 21 points for Los Angeles, while LeBron James and Brandon Ingram added 14 apiece. The Lakers, who handed the Nuggets their first loss of the season in late October in Los Angeles, struggled to find their shooting touch against Denver's defensive pressure. The Lakers were outshot 48.5 percent to 39.5 percent and finished just 5 of 35 (14.3 percent) from 3-point range. And for the 10th time this season, the Nuggets held an opponent to under 100 points. ""I've thought we were a defensive team in my head for a while now but this year it is our identity,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""It speaks to the buy-in and commitment and the fact that our guys realize that regardless of the offense, when we defend, we are a team that can beat anyone. We have done that against really good teams and really good players. Tonight was another example of that."" Up by eight at the half, the Nuggets stretched their lead to 89-71 with a strong third quarter. Jokic started the Nuggets' third by hitting a pair of 3s and Mason Plumlee's tip-in just before the quarter ended put Denver in front by 18 points going into the fourth quarter. The Nuggets kept the pressure on in the final period, outscoring the Lakers down the stretch 28-14. ""We stayed in it as much as we could, stopped the dam from running over,"" James said. ""At one point it broke open because we couldn't make shots."" Denver led 58-50 at the half, getting a boost from Millsap, who converted a three-point play and then hustled down the floor for a soaring block of Ingram's attempted layup in the last 39 seconds of the second quarter. Millsap had 16 points in the first half. TIP-INS Lakers: G Rajon Rondo remains sidelined with a broken right hand. He's missed the last six games but is making progress. He has been cleared to take part in non-contact basketball activities. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed a second consecutive game with left ankle soreness. Torrey Craig again started in his place. ... Millsap also had 11 rebounds, giving him his fourth double-double of the season. ... Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders watched the game from courtside seats. INJURY UPDATE Lonzo Ball, who had seven points in just over 18 minutes, missed most of the second half after spraining his left ankle earlier in the game. ""He sprained his left ankle pretty good but he wanted to give it a go,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""The way he was moving out there, it just didn't feel right to leave him on the court so we got him out there."" His playing status going forward was uncertain. ""We'll probably get a better idea of what we're dealing with after this flight and into tomorrow,"" Walton added.","401070985"
"PHOENIX --  A night after their biggest road blowout victory in 22 years, the Indiana Pacers had to go down to the wire against the Phoenix Suns. Long-range shooting touch pulled the Pacers through. Bojan Bogdanovic sank the go-ahead 3-pointer with 31 seconds to play and the Pacers escaped with a 109-104 victory over the Suns on Tuesday night. The Pacers, coming off 121-88 victory at Utah the previous night, had their hands full in a tight fourth quarter against a 4-15 Suns team. ""That wasn't pretty at all,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We weren't sharp in this game but you got to find ways to win games like that."" Myles Turner's 3 gave Indiana a 104-101 lead with 48 seconds to play, but Devin Booker responded with a 3-pointer to tie it at 104-104 with 45 seconds left. After Bogdanovic's long-range basket, Booker's attempt at a game-tying 3 barely rimmed out. Darren Collison's two free throws wrapped up the scoring. ""We didn't want to lose, simple as that,"" Collison said. ""There was nothing coach could tell us, other than the fact if we would've let that game slip away, it would've been a bigger downfall on our part. ... I felt like it was more on us that we kind of let the game get out of hand and kind of lost focus, but it's the NBA, we're just trying to get wins."" Doug McDermott and Domantas Sabonis scored 21 points apiece for Indiana. Turner added 16 and Bogdanovic 15. T.J. Warren scored 25 for the Suns. Booker was just 7-of-21 shooting but scored 20 points and had eight assists. Deandre Ayton had 18 points and 12 rebounds. Indiana led by as many as 13 points in the second and third quarters, but Phoenix, with Booker and Ayton on the bench, used a 15-2 run late in the third and early in the fourth to go up 85-81 when Richaun Holmes made one of two free throws with 9:51 to play. Until the final seconds, nobody led by more than four the rest of the way. McDermott and Sabonis each scored 12 in the second quarter. McDermott's consecutive 3s in an 8-0 Pacers spurt put Indiana up 46-35 with 6:37 left in the half. Indiana stretched it to 52-39 on Sabonis' two free throws but Phoenix got it back to single digits and trailed 61-54 at the break. Indiana stretched the lead back to 13, 76-63, on Collison's 3-pointer but the Suns finished the quarter with a 7-2 spurt, Isaiah Canaan's 3-pointer cutting the lead to 81-77 entering the final quarter. ""I think the awareness in the second half is something that we needed, that's how we have to play,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""And we battled. I think we gave ourselves a chance to come back, a chance the tie the game and maybe go overtime. Who knows?"" As for Booker's last shot, Kokoskov said, ""You don't put everything on the last shot. It was in and out. We know Book's going to make a lot of shots for this franchise."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana's 33-point win at Utah was the fifth time the Pacers have won a road game by at least 30 points and first in 22 years (when they won at Vancouver 127-80 in December 1996). ...  Indiana reserves scored a season-high 62 points in the rout at Utah. ... McDermott and Sabonis were a combined 8-for-11 in the second quarter against Phoenix. .... McDermott scored 21 for the second game in a row after going scoreless in his previous game. Suns:  Ayton became the fourth player since 1992 with at least 300 points and 200 rebounds in his first 20 NBA games. The others who did it are Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal. ... Ayton had 14 points and seven rebounds in the first half. ... A victory would have given Phoenix two wins in its last three games. Suns have won just four all season.","401070986"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Hornets coach James Borrego told Jeremy Lamb before the season that the starting spot at shooting guard was his -- as long as he earned it. That was all Lamb needed to hear. Lamb scored 22 points, Cody Zeller had a season-high 19 and Charlotte avenged a loss to Atlanta with a 108-94 victory over the Hawks on Wednesday night. Lamb is taking advantage of his first real chance for a regular starting job in the NBA by scoring at least 18 points in seven of Charlotte's last eight games. ""It was huge,"" Lamb said of Borrego expressing confidence in him. ""You always want your coaches to believe in you, to trust you. He didn't just give me the spot. He told me I had to earn it. And that's what I am trying to do."" Borrego was hired in May. The former San Antonio assistant felt a backcourt of former Connecticut stars Kemba Walker and Lamb could be ""dynamic"" in his offense. The 6-foot-4 Lamb came into the league with a reputation as a shooter, but has been improving on getting to the rim and creating shots for himself. Borrego also liked Lamb's length. ""I thought he fit well next to Kemba,"" Borrego said. ""I thought he could play-make, but I didn't know to this level. I didn't know he could play off the bounce like this. To his credit, he's advanced and grown off the dribble."" As for Lamb's recent scoring stretch, Borrego said: ""We're starting to expect this out of Lamb now, which is a good thing."" The win helped the Hornets erase a bad memory from Sunday night when the Hawks snapped a 10-game losing streak with a 124-123 victory, with John Collins blocking Walker's shot at the buzzer. There was no such drama this time around. Charlotte (11-10) limited Atlanta to 34 percent shooting to move back above .500 on the season and improve to 8-3 at home. Trae Young had 18 points for the Hawks, who were coming off a 115-113 win at Miami on Tuesday night. TIP-INS Hawks: Opened by making four of five shots from beyond the 3-point arc but finished the game 11 of 44. Hornets: Malik Monk left in the second half with a quad contusion. ... Frank Kaminsky continued to see extensive minutes off the bench ahead of Willy Hernangomez. Kaminsky finished with eight points on 3-for-9 shooting. WALKER'S OFF NIGHT Walker, who came in averaging 27.9 points per game, finished with 19 points while battling through an off shooting night. He was 6 of 19 from the field and 6 of 10 from the foul line. ""Anytime you have a player like Kemba, he's hard to scheme,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""But when he has an off night you have to take advantage of it. For them, they did. He still played well I thought. He just didn't have the explosive Kemba Walker-type of night."" PLAYING THROUGH ZELLER With the Hornets struggling offensively early on, they began playing through the 7-foot Zeller. ""The way they guard us, they create a lot of one-on-one matchups so we start to play through our bigs a lot,"" Borrego said. ""Cody got to the rim some, was playmaking. A lot of our stuff tonight was playmaking through the five-man."" ANDERSON RETURNS Atlanta shooting guard Justin Anderson returned after missing time with a leg injury. He scored 10 points and grabbed eight rebounds. ""It obviously feels good for me having had the game taken away from me for about six months, being able to get back out there and everything for me, just competing,"" Anderson said. ""Obviously it wasn't the result that we wanted, but we hung in there and we fought.""","401070987"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid once had to spike his dad's wish for him to become a volleyball player. With his father making a rare trip to Philly, Embiid showed once again he was wise to ditch digs for dunks. Embiid put on a show with his father in the stands for the first time this season, collecting 26 points and 14 rebounds while leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a 117-91 win over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. ""Embiid was doing some damage in the post,"" Knicks rookie Kevin Knox said. Embiid's spin move into a one-handed jam earned a smile and applause from Thomas Embiid, a colonel in the Cameroon military who is visiting from the family's home country and plans to spend a few weeks with his MVP candidate son. Growing up, Embiid had to convince his father that basketball wasn't a dangerous game and he didn't have to abide by Thomas' wishes of becoming an elite volleyball player. Embiid was aces against the Knicks. The 7-footer had 17 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the first half alone. He finished with his NBA-best 21st double-double and helped the Sixers improve to 11-1 at home. He didn't stick around to offer his usual quips and one-liners to the media -- Embiid split to catch up with his family. Philly's last home game was a rare disaster, a 121-112 loss to woeful Cleveland on Friday. Coach Brett Brown said the Sixers didn't play with spirit against the Cavs. They played with purpose against the road-weary Knicks. JJ Redick hit four 3s and scored 24 points and Ben Simmons had 14 points. Jimmy Butler hit a 3 in the third to make it 86-58 and give the Sixers a KO victory with former middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins sitting courtside. Redick made 10 of 14 shots and hit the 20-point mark for the third time in five games. ""I always feel like when I shoot the ball it's going to go in, but there's a different feeling I think when you haven't missed and you've taken a few shots and you just keep seeing the ball go in,"" he said. ""It certainly increases the dopamine levels in your brain."" Enes Kanter and Mario Hezonja each scored 17 points for New York. The Knicks have played nine of 12 games on the road and were coming off a 115-108 loss to Detroit on Tuesday. ""We didn't have an answer for any of them,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""That was a focused team, they came out with really good focus. We just got blitzed and we really didn't have an answer for anything they did."" Embiid had his 18th game of the season with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds and could have grabbed a seat with his father and chilled out in the fourth. The Sixers emptied the bench as the lead stretched to 31 points and won for the sixth time in seven games. TIP-INS Knicks: Fizdale said struggling draft picks Mitchell Robinson and Knox will not be sent to the G League. 76ers: The Sixers hope to provide a medical update on 2017 No. 1 draft pick Markelle Fultz on Friday. Fultz has not played since his agent shut him down and wanted an examination of the guard's right shoulder. Fultz had said he wasn't hurt and the decision came a day after he appeared to lose his backup point guard spot. ""There's been nothing more to talk about,"" Brown said. 0 FOR 3 Simmons might be playing like an All-Star, but he has yet to attempt a 3-pointer this season and missed all 11 tries last season. ""I do concede that he is going to need it at some point but I definitely don't think it is going to define him,"" Brown said.","401070988"
"NEW YORK --  Donovan Mitchell is back and Kyle Korver is on the way. Things certainly looked much better for the struggling Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. Mitchell returned from a two-game absence with 29 points, taking over down the stretch and leading the Jazz to a 101-91 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Mitchell scored 12 points in the final 5:42 to help Utah seize control of a close game. He showed no effects from his bruised ribs and shook off news of a trade shortly before the game that sent teammate Alec Burks to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the deal for Korver. ""I think it was tough for me. I was just kind of like, `Whoa!' It took me by surprise,"" Mitchell said. ""But you know, I think we did a good job of not letting that affect us on the floor. I think we stayed focused with the task at hand. But I missed my guy, for sure."" Rudy Gobert had 23 points, 16 rebounds and four blocked shots for the Jazz, who bounced back from a miserable performance in their last game without Mitchell, a 121-88 home loss to Indiana on Monday. They had dropped four of five and took a while to get going Wednesday but thrived at the end thanks to Mitchell, who scored mostly on drives into the lane and nailed a 3-pointer that made it 93-89. Utah outscored Brooklyn 31-13 in the fourth quarter. ""We got stops,"" Gobert said. ""Everyone was locked in, everyone was communicating and when we get stops we can score on the other end, and that's what we did."" The Jazz agreed to the Korver deal just before the game, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press. Utah entered 29th in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 31.9 percent and Korver, fourth in NBA history in 3-pointers made, should certainly improve that area. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 18 points off the bench for the Nets, who dropped their season-high fourth straight. D'Angelo Russell was 6 of 25 for 14 points. ""I think they had a great scouting report against us, whatever it was. I'll watch the film,"" Russell said. ""But I think they did a great job staying attached to our shooters and being in the right place in rotations."" The Nets missed their first six shots and the Jazz their first five, and it took a while before either heated up. Brooklyn started 4 for 19 but trailed only 17-16 after one quarter. Both teams did score 26 in the second, leaving Utah up 43-42 at halftime. The Nets opened an 11-point lead in the third quarter but it was mostly all Mitchell and the Jazz in the fourth. TIP-INS Jazz: Ricky Rubio was 0 for 9 from the field, scoring six points. ... Joe Ingles made his 530th 3-pointer, tying Darrell Griffith for fourth on Utah's career list. Ingles will soon catch Bryon Russell (540) for third but remains far behind John Stockton (845) and Gordon Hayward (689). Nets: Jarrett Allen had 14 points and 10 rebounds for his eighth double-double in 20 games this season, doubling his total from his rookie season, when he played in 72 games. ... Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 14 points and a season-high 11 rebounds for his first double-double. ... The Nets are 0-3 on a four-game homestand. DETAILS OF THE DEAL In exchange for Korver, the Jazz dealt guard Alec Burks along with two future second-round draft picks to the Cavaliers, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the swap had to be approved by the NBA. The 37-year-old Korver played for Utah from 2007-10.","401070989"
"HOUSTON --  The Dallas Mavericks had struggled on the road this season. They had come up empty against the Houston Rockets for the last couple years. So this one was pretty big. Rookie Luka Doncic and Devin Harris each scored 20 points, and Dallas beat Houston 128-108 on Wednesday night despite a triple-double by Rockets star James Harden. It's the third straight win for the Mavericks and just their second victory on the road this season after dropping seven of their first eight games away from home. They had dropped their last eight regular-season games against the Rockets. ""We're just improving,"" Harris said. ""Obviously we've got a long way to go. Defensively I think we're playing better, offensively I think there's still room for improvement. We're trending in the up direction. We got off to a slow start but now we're starting to play catch up."" Harden had 25 points, 17 assists and 11 rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough for a team missing Chris Paul because of an injury. Houston dropped its fourth in a row after winning a season-high five straight. ""Obviously nobody's happy and everyone is searching for answers and talking to ourselves and running into walls and everything else,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We did see a glimpse of when we could be really good and we've got to get back to there."" Harden knows the Rockets have to get better, but pointed out it's still early in the season. ""We went through a tough stretch and then we regrouped and won five in a row,"" he said. ""So we've just got to figure it out. We've got a lot of new guys and it's only 20 games into the season so we've got 60 more to go."" The 19-year-old Doncic, who was the third overall pick in the draft, has scored 20 or more points in 10 of 18 games this season. He is encouraged with the Mavs' improvement since starting the season 3-8. ""We just needed time,"" he said. ""From the beginning I said I wanted to go to the playoffs and we're doing a great job."" Houston trailed for most of the night but used a 33-point third quarter to trim a huge deficit to seven heading into the fourth. The Mavericks got going again in the final period, opening with a 10-2 run highlighted by back-to-back reverse layups by J.J. Barea. Clint Capela made a layup for Houston before the Mavericks used an 11-2 spurt to push their lead to 117-95 with seven minutes remaining, prompting D'Antoni to clear the bench. Paul sat out for the third straight game after resting the first game and missing the last two with a sore left hamstring. Capela and James Ennis had 18 points apiece for the Rockets, who are in 13th place in the Western Conference. The Mavericks led by 18 entering the third quarter after scoring 74 points in the first half behind 15 points from Doncic. The Rockets opened the second half with a 13-5 run to cut the lead to 79-69 with about eight minutes left in the third. Ennis led the way, scoring nine points. Dallas pushed its lead back out to 13 before Danuel House and Harden made back-to-back 3-pointers to get Houston within seven at 86-79. The Mavericks' advantage was down to five when a layup by Dwight Powell made it 96-89 entering the fourth. HARDEN'S NIGHT It was Harden's first triple-double this season and No. 36 for his career. The reigning NBA MVP also had six steals to join Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history with at least 25 points, 17 assists, 11 rebounds and six steals in a single game since steals became an official statistic in 1973-74, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Johnson did it on March 29, 1981. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dennis Smith had 10 points in his return after missing Saturday's game with a sprained right wrist. ... DeAndre Jordan had 13 points and seven rebounds. ... The Mavericks made 19 of 24 free throws. Rockets: Capela has scored at least 10 points in 19 straight games. ... D'Antoni said Nene, who hasn't played all season because of a strained right calf, was making progress but he still doesn't know when he'll be ready to return. ... Gerald Green missed his second game in a row with a sore right ankle.","401070990"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo kept doing his thing for the Milwaukee Bucks. But he still needed a helping hand from teammate Khris Middleton, who sank a clutch 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left to send the Bucks to a 116-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo had a season-high 36 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in an entertaining duel with former teammate Jabari Parker, who paced the Bulls with 24 points, eight rebounds and five assists. After several missed tips by Brook Lopez and a tap-out by guard Eric Bledsoe, Malcolm Brogdon smartly passed the ball back to a wide-open Middleton at the top of the 3-point arc to set up the winning shot. Justin Holiday missed a 3 for Chicago that would have tied it in the final seconds. Middleton's game-winner was the only shot he took in the fourth quarter. ""For several years, Khris has been a big shot-maker, a big-shot guy at the end of games,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""When you don't get a touch, that can make it harder. ""I think they were rotating, sometimes they were taking away Giannis and getting a quick rotation to Khris and we got some good open looks on the backside. He's a heck of a player."" Antetokounmpo just missed a third triple-double this season. He attacked in the paint and shot 14 of 21 from the field and 8 of 12 on free throws. ""So far, I've figured out my spots and I know where I can be effective from,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I've just got to keep being aggressive. I don't think there are guys in the league that can guard me 1-on-1 down there. ""But I think what makes this team great and what makes me great in this game plan is that I can pass the ball. I think teams are scared of that."" Antetokounmpo also had a crucial block of Parker's shot with the score tied at 111 in the last minute, and the star forward then sank two free throws with 36 seconds left before the Bulls' Zach LaVine tied the score with a reverse layup. The Bucks (15-6) improved to 11-2 at home and bounced back from a close loss Monday at Charlotte. Chicago (5-17) lost its fourth in a row and for the eighth time in nine games. Brogdon finished with 24 points, five rebounds and six assists while hitting all six 3-pointers he attempted. Middleton added 17 points, six rebounds and four assists. ""I was just trying to be aggressive and take my opportunities where they were,"" Brogdon said. ""Khris and Giannis attract so much attention. Just knock down shots."" LaVine also had 24 points for Chicago and rookie guard Ryan Arcidiacano continued his stellar play in the last week with 22 points, five rebounds and four assists. Robin Lopez added 17 points off the bench. ""I love how we're competing right now,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I thought we did execute down the stretch. When we have our movement, we have a lot of great looks at the basket."" The Bulls again scored 40 points in the first quarter, equaling their total in the opening quarter on Nov. 16 in the first meeting between the teams. Parker had 10 points in the quarter and the Bulls shot 66.7 percent from the floor (12 of 18) to take a 40-30 lead. Antetokounmpo sparked a Bucks rally in the second and finished the half with 20 points, five rebounds and four assists. Milwaukee outscored Chicago 33-22 in the second period to take a 63-62 halftime lead. A 3-pointer by Brook Lopez gave the Bucks a 77-72 lead with 7:40 left in the third quarter and prompted a Bulls timeout. Arcidiacono sank a pair of 3s as the Bulls regained the lead at 82-80 before the Bucks responded with dunks by Antetokounmpo and Pat Connaughton sandwiched around a free throw by Middleton. The Bucks led 92-89 entering the final quarter. TIP-INS Bulls: Second-year forward Lauri Markkanen is making progress in his recovery from a right elbow sprain sustained in training camp. He practiced Tuesday for the first time since being injured and worked out before Wednesday's game. ""The plan is to have him for a full-contact practice again (Thursday in Detroit),"" Hoiberg said. ""He will gradually get his rhythm and his timing and his conditioning back. It's exciting."" Markkanen, an all-NBA rookie first-team selection last season, has missed the first 22 games. ... G Denzel Valentine had left ankle surgery in Green Bay on Tuesday and will be out for the rest of the season. He is expected to return to full basketball activities in six months. ... Parker is getting more comfortable with his new team and entered averaging 16.3 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. ""He's had a great couple weeks for us,"" Hoiberg said. ""We're very tough to guard when he rebounds the ball and pushes it with pace. We're using him all over, as the trail-spot attack guy and using him on the block, and he's been a really good facilitator in those spots."" Bucks: Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova returned after missing two games with right knee soreness and had nine points and five rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. Budenholzer said Ilyasova and third-year forward Thon Maker will be counted on to help make up for the loss of center John Henson, who had surgery on his left wrist Tuesday. Henson is expected to be out at least 12 weeks but could return this season. ""We've played some really big lineups earlier in the season,"" Budenholzer said. ""Without John, we may play some smaller lineups and look at different combinations of guys. I think (Maker) knows what he needs to do.""","401070991"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Timberwolves showed off their improved defense Wednesday night against the San Antonio Spurs. It was quite a performance by Robert Covington and company. Covington scored 21 points, Karl-Anthony Towns and Derrick Rose each had 16 and the Timberwolves shut down the Spurs for a 128-89 victory. ""It's big time when you get a team like that and play an organization like that, and we come out and play defense the way we did,"" Towns said. ""It's a wonderful sight and it shows the hard work we're putting in day-in and day-out."" Minnesota (11-11) earned its fourth straight win to get to .500 for the first time since Oct. 31. Taj Gibson scored 13 points, and rookie Josh Okogie made three 3-pointers on his way to 12 points. Minnesota had dropped 14 of its last 15 against San Antonio, but it held the Spurs to 39.5 percent shooting. These aren't the Spurs of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, but the much-improved Timberwolves defense isn't the same, either. ""We're finally taking pride in it each and every night and not for a quarter, not for a few minute, not for one possession,"" guard Tyus Jones said. ""We're staying locked in on that end of the floor and I think we're starting to see it makes a difference when you're locked in on defense."" Minnesota led by as many as 48 before settling for its largest margin of victory against San Antonio in team history. The Timberwolves limited the Spurs to nine second-quarter points in the 15th single-digit defensive quarter in team history. Jakob Poeltl led the Spurs with 14 points, and Marco Belinelli added 11. Minnesota improved to 7-2 since trading disgruntled star Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia in exchange for Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round draft pick. The Wolves broke the game open with a 17-2 run to start the second quarter, mostly with their second unit on the floor. Minnesota led 57-34 at halftime, marking San Antonio's lowest-scoring half this season. SPUTTERING SPURS Jakob Poeltl led the Spurs with 14 points, and Marco Belinelli added 11. LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan each scored 10 and were the only starters in double figures. San Antonio closed out a 2-2 road trip, but that didn't mean very much to the Spurs after the blowout loss. ""You don't want to go out there and get embarrassed,"" DeRozan said. Aldridge placed more of the blame on San Antonio's inability to protect the ball, rather than Minnesota's defense. The Spurs turned it over a season-high 19 times. ""No, same defense,"" Aldridge said of Minnesota. ""We just didn't take care of the ball. They doubled me as they always do, so I didn't see anything different."" WAITING ON OKOGIE Okogie made the most of his 10:22 of playing time. He opened the fourth quarter with a soaring dunk that brought the crowd and the Wolves bench to its feet. ""I was telling them, `Ya'll better not let this lead down, `cause I'm trying to get in there as soon as possible,"" he said with a laugh. TIP-INS Spurs: F Pau Gasol is out indefinitely with a stress fracture in his left foot. The 17th-year veteran missed his 12th straight game; he had been getting some work on the court recently despite soreness. ""Then they took him off because he got a second opinion that it was a stress fracture,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""That's what they told me so it's not a secret I guess. So they put him back in the boot."" Gasol has played sparingly off the bench, averaging 6.6 points and 6.1 rebounds. Timberwolves: The Wolves' previous largest margin of victory against San Antonio was 24 twice, last done in 2013. The 39-point win also matches the Wolves' third-largest in franchise history. ... Minnesota also had a season-high 33 assists. Jeff Teague led the way with nine while Jones had eight.","401070992"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis gave the Pelicans' latest lineup tweak a ringing endorsement. Davis had 28 points and 15 rebounds as New Orleans stemmed a four-game slide with an up-tempo 125-104 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry adjusted his starting five by inserting Tim Frazier at point guard and moving Jrue Holiday to shooting guard, where he could focus more on finding his shot than running the offense. ""We had a hell of a game tonight,"" Davis said. ""It was a good game to see how we like to play and get back to how we played earlier in the year. When Tim's in that lineup, he's pushing the ball and lets Jrue be Jrue."" Holiday scored 29 points, while Julius Randle added 23 points and 12 rebounds for New Orleans. Frazier, who contributed 12 points and 12 assists, said his production resulted from not letting his recent lack of playing time discourage him from preparing hard for his next opportunity. ""Not everybody can be AD,"" Frazier said, adding that playing time ""comes and goes and your job as a player is to always be ready."" Nikola Mirotic, who had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Pelicans, also gushed about Frazier. ""I saw a couple times he could shoot the ball but he wanted to pass,"" Mirotic said. ""That's a great thing about him. He knows what he needs to do and what we need."" Kelly Oubre Jr. and Markieff Morris each scored 22 for the Wizards, who trailed by 20 at halftime and never got closer than 11 after that. John Wall added 17 points, while Bradley Beal had 16 points and 11 assists for Washington, which struggled to match the Pelicans' pace or presence under the basket. New Orleans outrebounded Washington 64-38 and turned 17 offensive rebounds into 28 second-chance points. The Pelicans also outscored Washington 62-38 in the paint and 26-8 on fast-break points. ""Our effort just wasn't good tonight. Without the ball, we didn't help each other out and our transition was terrible. As to why, I don't really know,"" Beal said. ""It's a little frustrating, but it's fixable. It's just a matter of getting used to those good habits."" TIP-INS Wizards: Lost to New Orleans for the first time in seven meetings and only the second time in 15. ... Wall was assessed a technical foul late in the third quarter for bickering with officials after he was called for a hack on Holiday's transition layup attempt. ... Jeff Green had 10 points. Pelicans: Mirotic is 14 of 28 from 3-point range in his last four games after going 3 of 8 against Washington. ... New Orleans improved to 9-2 at home, but plays its next two on the road, where the Pelicans are 2-9. ... The Pelicans committed 20 turnovers, down only two from Monday's loss to Boston, but their scoring was up and they largely controlled the game while also forcing 16 Wizards turnovers. FRAZIER FACTOR The Pelicans had looked disjointed and turnover-prone during their recent losing streak. Holiday was playing point guard because the usual starter at that spot, Elfrid Payton, is out with a broken finger. Frazier's insertion began paying dividends early. Holiday, who committed eight turnovers Monday against Boston, had 16 points and one turnover in the first half versus Washington. ""We did a good job of getting back to who we were,"" Gentry said, alluding to his team's 4-0 start, during which it averaged 128.3 points. Even with Davis starting 3 of 10 for nine points in the first half, New Orleans opened up a 20-point lead. The Pelicans closed the first half on a 21-7 run, beginning with Frazier's transition layup and 3-pointer. Later, Holiday pounced on a deflected ball at the top of the key and immediately floated it down the lane to where Davis could convert an alley-oop layup off the glass. Randle closed out the run with a layup as he was fouled and a tip-in of Darius Miller's missed 3, making it 67-47 at halftime. ""Everybody stepped up and came in and contributed and it just made my job easy,"" Frazier said. QUOTABLE ""Of course, Jrue likes to play off the ball. He'll tell you every day of the week he wants to play off the ball,"" Davis said. ""He knows where his strengths are. He hates playing the point. He's not a point guard.""","401070993"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Russell Westbrook moved into a tie for third place on the NBA list for triple-doubles with 23 points, 19 rebounds and 15 assists, and the Oklahoma City Thunder completed a regular-season sweep of the short-handed Cleveland Cavaliers with a 100-83 victory Wednesday night. Westbrook's triple-double was his third this season -- all in the past four games -- and the 107th of his career, matching Jason Kidd and trailing only Oscar Robertson (181) and Magic Johnson (138). Kidd took 1,247 games to reach 107, while Westbrook needed only 760. The 19 rebounds were one off Westbrook's career high, set in last season's finale against Memphis. Jerami Grant added 21 points, one shy of his career best, on 8-of-12 shooting for the Thunder, who have won 13 of 16 after an 0-4 start. Jordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 25 points, while Collin Sexton (21 points, 10 rebounds) and Cedi Osman (14 points, 10 rebounds) each had a double-double. The Cavaliers agreed to trade Kyle Korver to the Utah Jazz after the team arrived at Chesapeake Energy Arena, leaving them with only nine players in uniform. Eight of them got into the game. Oklahoma City trailed 55-51 in the third quarter when Westbrook started a 13-0 run with a 3-pointer. He capped it by assisting on a dunk by Grant with 5:36 left in the period that completed the triple-double and put the Thunder up 64-55. By the end of the quarter, the Thunder led 73-62, and the Cavaliers got no closer than nine the rest of the way. Cleveland took advantage of early offensive sloppiness by the Thunder to twice go up by 11 points, the latter time at 38-27 after a 3-pointer by Osman with 7:01 left in the second quarter. Oklahoma City used a 20-6 run to get back in the game, which was tied 47-all at halftime. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Asked before the game about the trade set to send Korver to Utah, coach Larry Drew declined comment. Korver was at the arena when he learned of the deal, which still needed to be approved by the NBA. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard didn't realize he was at 10 3-pointers. Had he known, well, maybe he would have gone for the record. ""I honestly didn't know I had made 10. If I would have known that I would have went for it,"" Lillard said, adding with a smile, ""What is it? Fourteen? Oh, I could have got that, too."" Lillard set a franchise record for 3s on his way to 41 points, and the Portland Trail Blazers held off the Orlando Magic 115-112 on Wednesday night. Jusuf Nurkic added 16 points and 13 rebounds as the Blazers stopped a season-high three-game slide. Lillard surpassed the previous Portland record of nine 3s that he shared with Nicolas Batum. ""It felt good. I've been struggling kind of shooting from 3,"" Lillard said. ""I shoot a lot of them. After practice, sometimes, before practice, I've been shooting and shooting them. I knew eventually I would get hot and start making them. It just felt good."" He'll just have to wait for another chance at the NBA record of 14 set by Golden State's Klay Thompson in a game earlier this season. Nikola Vucevic had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Magic, who have lost four of their last five games. Portland pushed its lead to 108-98 on Evan Turner's layup with just over five minutes to go, but Evan Fournier hit a pair of 3-pointers and Jonathan Isaac added a layup to close the gap to 108-106. Jonathan Simmons made two free throws to tie it, but CJ McCollum responded with a 3-pointer for the Blazers. Fournier had a step-back jumper to get Orlando within a point before McCollum missed a pair of free throws with about two minutes to go. Lillard's floater with 55 seconds gave Portland a 113-110 lead. There was some confusion at the end of the game after what was described as a game-clock malfunction prompted a video review. Officials put 0.9 seconds on the clock but Orlando's inbounds was off and time ran out. ""We've got to get better. C'mon. You play that offensive game against that team, in this arena, you gotta win that game,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Orlando, playing the fourth of a six-game trip, was without Aaron Gordon, who was sidelined by a sore lower back. Gordon is averaging 16.1 points and 7.3 rebounds this season. He left Monday's 116-110 loss at Golden State in the third quarter with back spasms. Isaac replaced Gordon in the starting lineup. Vucevic scored 15 in the first half to help Orlando to a 63-55 lead at the break. Nik Stauskas had 15 early points for the Blazers. Trailing 82-79, Portland went on a 16-2 run, capped by Lillard's record-breaking 10th 3-pointer, to go up 95-84 going into the fourth quarter. ""We have to play with more physicality, especially on the rebounding. We did a good job getting stops, we just didn't get the rebound,"" Vucevic said. ""We have to change that and play with a lot more intensity."" Portland coach Terry Stotts said the Blazers were better in the second half. ""The first half was very disappointing with our defensive focus, aggressiveness, everything. I didn't think we had much of an impact on the game at all in the first half defensively,"" He said. ""But I liked, especially the third quarter, that defensively we were much better and obviously Damian in the third quarter was incredible. He carried us like he does often."" Portland was coming off a 104-100 loss at home to the Clippers on Sunday night. ABOUT THOSE 3S Portland finished with a season-high 19 3-pointers. Lillard's seven 3-pointers in the third were a franchise record for a quarter. TIP-INS Magic: Ross is from Portland and played at Jefferson High School before going to Washington. ... The Magic have dropped five straight to Portland. ... Vucevic fouled out with 13.7 seconds left. Trail Blazers: It was Stotts' 400th career win. He is the 47th coach in NBA history to reach the milestone. ... It was Lillard's fourth game this season with 40 or more points.","401070995"
"LOS ANGELES --  Nearly a quarter of the way into their season, Danilo Gallinari and the Los Angeles Clippers are the surprise leaders in the Western Conference. Gallinari was one of three Clippers to record a double-double as they won their ninth straight home game, defeating the Phoenix Suns 115-99 on Wednesday night. Los Angeles improved to 14-6, which ties the fourth-best record after 20 games in franchise history. Along with being the surprise leaders in the West, the Clippers own the NBA's longest active home winning streak and have won 10 of their last 12 overall. ""We have a lot of confidence. We know what we can do,"" said Gallinari, who matched his season high with 28 points and grabbed a season-best 10 rebounds. ""We are happy but it is just the beginning. It is such a long marathon that the record we have now doesn't mean anything. It's just November."" Lou Williams scored 20 points while Tobias Harris (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Boban Marjanovic (12 points, 12 rebounds) also notched double-doubles for the Clippers, who outrebounded the Suns 56-34 but committed 21 turnovers. ""It was not a great night except for winning the game,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""It was one of those games where we didn't execute well. You're going to have games like this but when you win them, they're forgivable."" The game was tied 49-all at halftime before Los Angeles took control with a 20-4 run over a five-minute stretch in the third quarter to go up 83-63. Gallinari scored 12 of the first 15 points during the run, including a pair of 3-pointers. Los Angeles was 11 of 17 from the field, including 5 of 7 on 3-pointers. The Clippers also went 13 of 15 from the foul line as they outscored Phoenix 40-25 in the quarter. ""The third quarter was brutal. We couldn't find the rhythm and the stops. We were taking individual action, which isn't the way to win,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. Phoenix, off to the worst start in franchise history at 4-17, pulled to 104-93 on Deandre Ayton's reverse layup with four minutes remaining but could not get any closer. Devin Booker led the Suns with 23 points and Elie Okobo added 19. TIP-INS Suns: T.J. Warren and Josh Jackson each scored 15. ... Ayton, the top pick in this year's NBA draft, had a season-low four points but led the team in rebounds with nine. ... Richaun Holmes came off the bench to score 10 points. ...

"TORONTO --  Not even a dominant Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors could slow down the red-hot Toronto Raptors. Kawhi Leonard scored a season-high 37 points, Pascal Siakam added a career-high 26 and the Raptors overcame a 51-point performance from Durant to beat the Warriors 131-128 in overtime on Thursday night, extending their winning streak to seven. ""We were able to make shots, we were able to get some stops in overtime,"" Leonard said. ""It's a building block for us, and I'm happy we got the win."" Kyle Lowry had 10 points and 12 assists, Serge Ibaka scored 20 points and Danny Green had 13 as the Raptors snapped an eight-game losing streak against Golden State and won a contest billed as a potential NBA Finals preview. ""What a game,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""An incredible basketball game for the fans to watch. We came up just short."" Toronto improved its league-leading record to 19-4. Durant scored 40 or more in three straight for the first time, finishing with his highest total of the season. He also had 11 rebounds and six assists. ""Tonight we were down early, we were down big and I just tried to be aggressive and go get a bucket,"" Durant said. Klay Thompson scored 23 points and Jonas Jerebko had 16 of his 20 in the fourth quarter and overtime, but Golden State had its three-game winning streak snapped and lost to Toronto for the first time since March 2014. Lowry's 3-pointer with 55 seconds to go in the fourth quarter put the Raptors up 119-113 but Durant replied with back-to-back 3s of his own, including a game-tying shot with 8.6 seconds left. ""When he's feeling it, there's not a whole lot the defense can do,"" Kerr said. Leonard drove and kicked to Ibaka on the final possession, but the Raptors big man couldn't get a shot off before the buzzer. Green hit a tiebreaking 3 with 2:07 left in the extra session, and Toronto added to its lead when Lowry stole the ball from Andre Iguodala, leading to a pair of free throws by Siakam. Jerebko's dunk cut the gap to three but Toronto caught another break when Iguodala was called for travelling. Siakam was fouled and made one, with Leonard grabbing the rebound on the missed second shot. Siakam was fouled again, and capped it with another pair from the line. ""His confidence is very high,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Siakam. ""It just keeps inching along."" The short-handed Warriors were without star guard Stephen Curry, who sat for the 11th straight game because of a strained left groin. Curry is expected to return Saturday at Detroit. ""Obviously we've been looking forward to getting him back but I'm proud of the way the guys have fought without him,"" Kerr said. ""Hopefully Draymond (Green) won't be too far behind him."" Green (sprained right toe) and fellow forward Alfonzo McKinnie (sore left foot) both sat for the seventh straight game. Green hopes to be back around the end of the current road trip. Leonard connected on his first six shots and scored 13 points in the first quarter. Siakam added 10 for the Raptors, who were up by 18 points in the first and led 38-25 after one. ""They did a really good job of throwing that first punch,"" Iguodala said. Thompson scored nine points in the second and Durant added eight as Golden State cut the deficit to 67-58 at the half. Durant capped an 18-point third quarter with a 32-foot pull-up 3, the final basket in a personal 13-point streak. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State has lost five straight on the road. ...

""The rental expired,"" Nurse joked. Kerr, who dressed more conservatively, said Nurse ""definitely nailed"" his colorful coat. ""I'm always thinking about Craig, especially when we have TNT games,"" Kerr said. ""I worked with him for eight years. He's just such a part of the history of this game and a good friend, and we miss him.""","401070997"
"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James' team was in danger of blowing a close game Thursday night until he seized control and carried his teammates to victory. The Los Angeles Lakers are still getting used to this enormous advantage, and they love it. The Indiana Pacers? They've seen this plenty of times over the years, and they're still not crazy about it. James scored 12 of his 38 points in the final five minutes, and the Lakers rebounded from their first back-to-back losses in a month with a 104-96 victory over the Pacers. Brandon Ingram scored 14 points and Josh Hart added 13, but the Lakers wasted an early 24-point lead before James carried them to their 10th win in 14 games. ""We've got the best player ever to put on a jersey, so that helps us out a lot,"" Hart said. James added nine rebounds and seven assists in his first game since scoring a season-low 14 points in the Lakers' loss at Denver. The Lakers are just 21 games into James' first season, and he is still adjusting his game to his new team's needs. He's playing the fewest minutes per game in his career, and he is learning to delegate responsibility for ball-handling and big shots. But when the Lakers need the four-time league MVP to put them on his shoulders, the 16-year veteran can do that, too. ""That's the challenge I've been kind of battling with since the season started,"" James said. ""How much do I defer and allow some of our young guys to figure out, and how much do I try to take over games? I think tonight was one of those instances where they looked at me and wanted me to close the game, and I just tried to make plays."" Indiana trimmed Los Angeles' lead to 89-88 on Domantas Sabonis' jumper with 4:59 left, but James replied with a 3-pointer and a three-point play on consecutive possessions to start a 10-0 Lakers run. He added a 22-foot jumper with 2:21 to play and a 19-footer on the next possession, calmly sealing it. ""I figured I wouldn't have the ball in my hands as much, coming into the season and knowing the multiple ball-handlers that we have on this team,"" James said. ""Those guys have the ability to make plays as well. But I'm available anytime we need a play to be made. It's a challenge for me, and it's an adjustment for me, but whatever it takes to help our ballclub be as great as it can be toward the end of the season, and at the same time getting better every day."" Sabonis had 20 points and 15 rebounds as the Pacers lost for the first time in three stops on their four-game West Coast trip. Victor Oladipo sat out his sixth straight game for Indiana with a sore right knee, but the Lakers still needed James and some strong defense to close it out. The Pacers missed five of their six 3-point attempts in the fourth quarter. ""It's a challenge to match up and defend those guys when LeBron is playing five different positions,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""Late in the game, he got aggressive and looked to attack to make something happen. He hit some shots and made some plays whenever the game got close."" James' Cleveland Cavaliers eliminated the Pacers from the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, going to seven games in the opening round last year. James' Miami Heat also sent Indiana home in three consecutive postseasons from 2012-14. ""We had this game,"" said Darren Collison, who scored nine points. ""We were up. We did some good things, and we didn't do some good things. We know what we did wrong collectively."" TIP-INS Pacers: Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 points for the Pacers, and Thaddeus Young added 11. ... Indiana fell short of its eighth road victory already this season. Only Toronto and Utah have more. Lakers: Lonzo Ball had two points and eight rebounds in 34 minutes while playing through an ankle injury. Ball sprained his ankle in LA's loss at Denver on Tuesday, but made good on his vow to play through it. ... Lance Stephenson played five scoreless minutes. He played in all 82 games last season for the Pacers in his second stint with the club, averaging 9.2 points. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit three 3-pointers and scored 11 points. CONTRASTING QUARTERS The Lakers scored the game's first 13 points and jumped to a 23-point lead while rolling to a 38-point first quarter. Yet LA led only 56-50 at halftime after Sabonis scored 14 during the Pacers' 35-point second quarter. AWAITING OLADIPO Oladipo scrimmaged in half-court work before the game, but wasn't quite ready to play. The Indiana star could go through a full practice Friday. ""We can't worry about that,"" McMillan said when asked if the Pacers miss their top scorer. ""We've got to go to work with the guys that are on the court.""","401070998"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Clippers built and blew several big leads while trying to extend their five-year winning streak in Sacramento. Each time they let one slip away, Tobias Harris or Montrezl Harrell were there to get Doc Rivers' team going again. Harris scored 28 points, Harrell added 24 and the Clippers beat the Kings 133-121 on Thursday night. ""We couldn't get away from them,"" Rivers said ""It's one of those games where a lot of teams fold, but we didn't. Every time they made a run either Tobias or (Danilo Gallinari) or Trez made a big play. That's what type of team we have. That's why we're so good."" Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 17 points, and Gallinari and Avery Bradley scored 16 apiece as the Clippers won their ninth in 10 games. Los Angeles extended its streak in Sacramento to 12 games. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored a career-high 26 for Sacramento. Marvin Bagley III added 18 points and 10 rebounds. Kings coach Dave Joerger faced questions before the game about problems between him and the team's front office after The Athletic reported that Joerger asked assistant general manager Brandon Williams to leave the team's shootaround earlier Thursday. It comes less than two weeks after a report by Yahoo Sports suggesting that Joerger was in trouble with management over his handling of the team's younger players, specifically Bagley, the second overall pick who has come off the bench in all 21 games this season. ""My job is to make sure that we are as prepared as we can be for the task in front of us and to try to limit as much distractions as possible,"" Joerger said. ""I think the sunshine on this team, this group of players, and our city has been as high as it's been since I've been in the NBA. I'm just trying to keep the distractions to a minimum with our group. I love the game. I know that this is just part sometimes that comes with it."" The Kings held together pretty well against Los Angeles before Harris and Harrell helped the Clippers pull away in the fourth quarter. After Bogdanovic's layup cut the Clippers' lead to 112-108, Harris and Harrell combined for 11 consecutive points, including a pair of three-point plays by Harrell. ""We had a little lapse but we kept fighting through,"" Harris said. ""When you've got different options to go to in the fourth quarter to win a game, especially down the stretch, that's key."" The teams exchanged 42-point quarters in the first half. Los Angeles led by 18 in the first quarter but Sacramento went on three big runs in the second quarter and closed within 71-68 at halftime.

"BOSTON --  After stumbling through a late November slump, the Boston Celtics scored a season-high for the second game in a row. Kyrie Irving scored 29 points in the first three quarters and was one of seven Boston players in double figures as the Celtics routed the Cleveland Cavaliers 128-95 on Friday night. ""It makes our jobs a lot easier to go out there and play at a high level when we're all doing it, not just a couple guys here and there. We need everybody,"" Irving said. Marcus Morris scored 15, Jayson Tatum had 13 points and Aron Baynes finished with 10 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics, who had all five starters score in double figures and broke 100 points before the fourth quarter. The Celtics dominated inside, outscoring Cleveland in the paint 54-32, and were strong outside as well, making 17 of 31 3-pointers. Irving made 11 of 15 shots and was 5-for-7 from 3-point range as the Celtics surpassed their 124 points scored Monday in a win at New Orleans. ""Nobody's going to play perfect, but I think that our approach was good,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""They stayed the course They played together. A lot of guys did a lot of good things and kind of built off of what we've talked about."" Boston took the game over in the third quarter, making 6 of 8 3-pointers and outscoring Cleveland 39-20 in the period. Marcus Smart had 12 points and seven assists and Gordon Hayward added 14 points off the bench before the Celtics reserves took over and finished off the short-handed Cavaliers. ""I thought they really out-toughed us,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""We had moments in the first half where I thought we played well, but there were some plays we got out-toughed. That was the most disheartening thing about this game."" Tristan Thompson had 13 points and 12 rebounds, his fifth double-double in six games for Cleveland, and Jordan Clarkson scored 16. Alec Burks added 15 points in his Cavs' debut and Collin Sexton also scored 15. ""They came out, made shots, got to the rim -- really did what they wanted to do with no resistance,"" Thompson said. ""At the end of the day, it's on the starters. You've got to be ready to go, me included."" The Celtics closed out the first half on a 15-5 run, taking a 62-52 lead on Morris' 3-pointer at the buzzer. Boston kept it going from outside in the third quarter, starting with another 3-pointer by Irving. Morris, who made all three free throws after drawing a foul with 9:09 left, added a 3-pointer to put the Celtics up 77-61 and Smart hit a 3 a few minutes later to stretch the margin to 82-62. Irving and Hayward made back-to-back 3-pointers and Hayward converted a three-point play with 2:27 left in the third to put Boston up 95-70. Terry Rozier topped it off with one more 3-pointer, just beating the buzzer and putting Boston up 101-72 after three. SHORT STREAK The Celtics had lost four of five, including three straight, before Monday night's win at New Orleans. The two-game winning streak puts the Celtics at 12-10, hardly where an Eastern Conference contender wants to be. ""It's only been two games,"" Irving said.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Charlotte packed the paint, and Utah took advantage. Donovan Mitchell scored 30 points, Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 17 rebounds and the Jazz scored 54 points off 3-pointers to hold off the Hornets 119-111 on Friday night. Kyle Korver made four 3-pointers and scored 14 points in his debut with the Jazz, who acquired the veteran from the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. Jae Crowder, Korver's former teammate in Cleveland, added 24 points off the bench for Utah, including six 3s. ""We just took what they gave us,"" Crowder said of the open looks. ""(But) I was surprised. I'm not gonna lie."" The Hornets got within six points with just over nine minutes left in the game, but Korver hit a pair of 3s to help hold them off. ""We were right there,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""We just couldn't get over the hump tonight."" Charlotte's biggest concern going into the game was controlling the paint. The Hornets did well inside -- scoring 70 points to Utah's 46 -- but couldn't shut down the long-range game. ""This was not a team that was thriving at the 3-point line,"" Borrego said. ""They made 18. We made nine. So what they didn't get at the inside they made up for at the 3-point line. Give them credit, they moved us around from the start."" Charlotte clawed back late in the first half, mostly behind star Kemba Walker and veteran Tony Parker, and tied the game for the first time midway through the third period on a three-point play by guard Jeremy Lamb. But Utah kept hitting 3s. Joe Ingles made a 24-footer, Mitchell hit a 27-footer and Crowder connected on a 25-footer during a 90-second stretch late in the third period to get the lead back to 13. ""We had a lot of great looks tonight,"" Korver said. ""It's just kind of the way basketball goes. You see one go down, then it snowballs. Obviously, Rudy put a ton of pressure on the basket. But we have great guards who are capable of making plays."" Utah took its biggest lead at the start of the second period, a 16-point advantage, behind 10 points from Mitchell and eight from Crowder. Walker finished with 21 points and seven rebounds, and Lamb had a season-high 24 points for the Hornets.

"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons had every reason to look past Friday night's game against the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls were coming in with a 4-17 record, having lost four in a row, and Detroit was to host the Golden State Warriors one night later. To make that matchup even more distracting, the Warriors expected Stephen Curry to return to the lineup on Saturday. But the Pistons kept their focus. Reggie Jackson set the early tone with eight points in the first four minutes, and Detroit never trailed in a 107-88 victory. ""We have to play with urgency every night,"" Blake Griffin said. ""We can't worry about if we're playing the next night or who we might be playing. We have to go out there and win the game we're playing."" Jackson scored 17 of his 20 points in the first half, impressing his coach in the process. ""We know Reggie isn't 100 percent after sitting out so long with that (ankle) injury,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""He didn't really start working out until July, and he didn't have any contact until training camp. He's not going to be at full speed until Christmas or New Year's."" Detroit also got big nights from their two post players as they won their fourth straight game. Andre Drummond had 19 points and 19 rebounds and Griffin added 20 points and 10 rebounds. Casey was able to use his reserves for most of the fourth quarter, but he wasn't worried about fatigue against the Warriors. ""Energy isn't usually a problem when you are playing that team at home,"" he said. ""They are the champs and they've got a ton of talent, especially with Steph coming back."" Wendall Carter scored a career-high 28 points for the Bulls, who lost their fifth straight. Chicago also plays Saturday, traveling to Texas to face the Houston Rockets. Detroit led 55-40 at the half, but the Bulls adjusted at the start of the third quarter, running their offense through pick-and-rolls for Zach LeVine and Carter. ""Wendell was hot, so I had to get him the ball,"" LeVine said. ""He had a career night with all those points and with good defense, but the rest of us didn't play well enough to win."" Carter had 15 points in the first 4:40 of the third quarter, with LeVine adding seven assists. That got Chicago within 62-57, but Carter committed his second and third fouls in the process. ""I give our guys credit for getting back into the game when our outside shots weren't falling,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""Wendell was terrific. I was proud of the way he went out there and got us back into the game."" Carter stayed in the game, but the Pistons began collapsing on him and were able to push the lead back to 79-61 before he scored again. ""We had a lapse for a few minutes there, but that young man also made a lot of plays,"" Casey said. ""(Drummond) has to be a little quicker sliding over in front of him, but we were mainly forcing him to take shots that we're happy to give him. He just knocked them down. He's going to be a good player in this league."" Detroit led by as many as 23 points in the fourth quarter. ""We did a good job defensively, and that made it a lot easier for us on the offensive end,"" Griffin said. ""We were getting stops, getting out on the break and getting easy baskets. That's always good to see."" PISTONS HOPING FOR MORE BIG CROWDS The Pistons are expecting a rare sellout on Saturday for the Warriors, and Casey hopes there will be more big crowds to come. ""It is easy to get fans to come out on a Saturday night to watch that team,"" he said. ""What we need to do is win enough games to get the respect of our fans so they will come out and watch us play anyone, even on a Monday or Tuesday. That's when you need to have a hot gym."" TIP INS Bulls: Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said forward Lauri Markkanen practiced with the team on Thursday and took part in Friday's shootaround. Markkanen has missed the entire season with a sprained right elbow. ... The Bulls missed 17 of their first 19 3-point attempts. Pistons: Blake Griffin scored 20-plus points for the 15th time in 19 games this season, while Drummond had his 10th game with at least 15 points and 15 rebounds.","401071002"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and 76ers pushed aside the short-handed Wizards in a hurry. Embiid had 16 points and 15 rebounds, Simmons added 13 points and 10 assists and both Philadelphia stars sat for the final quarter and a half in the 76ers' 123-98 victory over Washington on Friday night. T.J. McConnell scored 15 points to help the 76ers win their third in a row and seventh in the last eight. They improved to 12-1 at home. The 25-point win followed a season-high 26-point home blowout of the Knicks in a 117-91 on Wednesday night. Philadelphia took large leads in many triumphs this season only to see teams make it close late. Nine of the 76ers' 16 wins have been by six points or less. ""It's great for the team,"" Embiid said. ""Early in the season we had problems (holding large leads). I'm hoping we corrected it."" Bradley Beal had 19 points for the short-handed Wizards. They have lost two straight. Washington once again played without Dwight Howard. He's expected to miss two to three months after undergoing spinal surgery on Friday to relieve pain in his glutes. The Wizards also didn't have starter Otto Porter Jr., who was out for personal reasons. ""They outplayed us,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""They're a talented team. You have to have your entire roster to give yourself the best chance."" The first half was full of highlights for Philadelphia, which led 68-46 at the break. Embiid drained a 3-pointer after a no-look, between-the-legs pass from Simmons early in the first; Simmons finished a drive with a dunk after a no-look, over-the-shoulder dish from McConnell with 4 1/2 minutes left in the first; and Simmons brought down the house with an alley-oop jam after an assist from Furkan Korkmaz. ""They were making shots, moving much faster than us,"" Brooks said. ""They were clicking."" Philadelphia's led by 35 in the second half, and the hosts finished the third period ahead 98-70. By then, Simmons and Embiid were resting comfortably on the bench while the reserves put the finishing touches on the 76ers' fifth straight win over Washington in Philadelphia. ""That was a good team effort,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We were able to rest guys."" BAND BROTHERS Simmons and Jimmy Butler sported matching white head bands as a sign of solidarity. ""They are defensive brothers,"" Brown said. ""They're blood brothers. That band, to me, signifies a bonding, a defensive bonding. I've asked Jimmy to put Ben under his wing and really help Ben be all he can be defensively."" HOWARD UPDATE The team announced that Howard underwent a lumbar microdiscotemy Friday in California and will be re-evaluated in two to three months. Doctors determined a herniated disk was causing Howard's gluteal pain and nerve irritation. Howard had missed the last five games after aggravating the injury, which also caused him to sit out training camp and the first seven games of the season. Brooks acknowledged prior to the game that rebounding without the 6-foot-11 Howard has been a challenge. ""We had a game plan with Dwight being in the mix and shoring up our rim protection and rebounding issues,"" Brooks said. ""We struggle rebounding the ball. We just have to keep rebounding by committee."" TIP-INS Wizards: Jeff Green replaced Porter in the starting lineup after being a game-time decision due to lower back soreness. Green got up slowly before exiting to the bench after fouling Simmons and falling hard to the floor with 5:17 left in the first. He had four points. ... Washington's last win in Philadelphia came on March 17, 2016, 99-94. 76ers: G Markelle Fultz will continue to have tests on his right shoulder into next week.

"NEW YORK --  Mike Conley felt comfortable enough to let the Memphis Grizzlies' new kid take over near the end of regulation. Conley, a veteran point guard, then showed Jaren Jackson Jr. how he could single-handedly beat a team over two overtime periods. Conley scored 13 of Memphis 14 points in the second overtime session, Jackson scored a career-high 36 points and the Grizzlies beat the Brooklyn Nets 131-125 Friday. ""He's got a big heart, man. He's got the gene to make the big shots in the big time moments"", Conley said of the 19-year-old Jackson. ""Man, he is built for it. The shots he made were shots a lot of young guys won't attempt."" Even with Marc Gasol and Conley on the floor, the fourth overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft had the confidence to hit a 25-foot 3-pointer from the left wing before he got fouled and closed the deficit to 111-108 with 26.8 seconds left. Brooklyn then fumbled an inbounds play with 23 seconds left, placing the ball in Jackson's hand once again. Gasol found Jackson, whose 30-foot shot from the right wing evened it 111-all, setting the stage for Conley's overtime surge. ""It's whoever we put out there,"" Jackson said. ""Whoever is called upon down the stretch, you got to be ready."" Jackson became the third-youngest in league history with a 30-point game behind LeBron James and Kevin Durant. ""In winning time, to take those shots, it takes a unique heart, skill, ability and just cold-blooded nature,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Jaren has that."" Conley kept Memphis' hopes alive in regulation when he blocked Spencer Dinwiddie's potential game-winning basket and then scored on a floater to tie it 117-all with nine seconds left in the first overtime period. The Grizzlies' point guard then practically beat the Nets on his own in the second overtime period, shooting 3-for-5 from the field and making all seven of his free throws to finish with 37 points and 10 rebounds. Conley had let the Nets back into the game with an errant pass with 2:59 left. D'Angelo Russell, who finished 26 points, made a reverse layup to put the Nets ahead 125-124. He tried to go shot-for-shot with Conley, but his eight points in the second overtime period weren't quite enough. ""He's tough, he's proven in this league and capable of doing this day in and day out,"" Russell said. But Conley went back to work, hitting a jumper and making a pair of free throws that extended Memphis' lead to 128-125 with 19.9 seconds left. The Grizzlies never trailed again. Gasol had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who snapped a three-game losing streak. DeMarre Carroll had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, whose losing streak hit five games. The Nets broke away from a tightly contested game in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter after the teams traded leads for most of the first three periods. Former Nets player Marshawn Brooks gave Memphis am 87-80 lead to start the fourth before Brooklyn's defense tightened and its offense took off with a 14-0 run, capped by DeMarre Carroll's putback layup with 8:00 remaining in the game. After Gasol traveled and then missed an easy shot to the right side of the rim, Spencer Dinwiddie gave the Nets their biggest lead of the game with a 3-pointer from the left corner that made it 102-92. Memphis cut the lead 109-104 on Garrett Temple's basket before Dinwiddie's layup made it 111-104 with 33 seconds remaining. Jackson then connected on a four-point play after he was fouled on a 3-pointer with 26 seconds left. Jackson then took advantage of a botched inbounds play by Brooklyn when Russell lost control of the ball, and followed up by hitting a 3 from the left wing. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis had lost its last three games to the Nets. . Jackson fell a point shy of tying Shareef Andul-Raheem's rookie franchise record for points in a regular-season game. . Jackson's 36 points are the most by a rookie in the NBA this year. . It's the first time two Memphis players scored 30-plus in a regular-season game when Conley (31) and Gasol (30) did it on March 7, 2009, against Philadelphia Nets: G Joe Harris was held out of Friday night's game due to tightness in his left adductor. . Carroll's 21 points of the bench were the most he's had off the bench in his career. WELCOMED ADDITION Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff wouldn't mind having veteran big man Joakim Noah coming off his bench if he does end up signing with the Grizzlies. Noah became a free agent on Oct. 13, a week before the season tipped off after the veteran declined a buyout and was waived by the New York Knicks after his disappointing two-year stint came to an end. But the 33-year-old center seems like a good fit on a Memphis team that ranks fifth in defensive efficiency, allowing 103.1 points per 100 possessions. It was reported early Friday that the New York City native was close to agreeing to a one-year, veteran's minimum deal. ""Any time you add or have the possibility of adding a veteran, a guy who is a defensive-minded player, a really good defensive rebounder, you know it adds to the depth of any team"", Bickerstaff said before Friday night's game in Brooklyn. `If that were to happen it would be a bonus for us.""","401071004"
"MIAMI --  A new look on the court and some really old looks on the sidelines were exactly what the Miami Heat needed. Finally, they won at home. Josh Richardson scored 20 points, Dwyane Wade added 18 and the Heat wasted most of a 31-point lead before hanging on to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 106-101 on Friday night. Miami had the massive lead by the midpoint of the second quarter, then saw the margin cut to three in the final moments before surviving and snapping a six-game home losing streak. ""We can walk out of here with a different feeling,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. It started with a different look. Miami's black ""Vice"" uniforms, whose unveiling coincided with the start of the home slide, were ditched in a decision that was made shortly before game time. The Heat donned red uniforms instead, calling it ""an organizational decision."" Plus, as part of the recent NBA tributes to late broadcaster Craig Sager and his unique sense of fashion, Spoelstra and his assistants wore their outlandish best. Spoelstra wore a blue and white plaid coat -- a nod to both Sager and Dr. Jack Ramsay -- while assistant Dan Craig went with a leathery look and Juwan Howard wore sneakers that loosely resembled the sort of colorful jackets Sager made famous. ""Let's talk about our head coach: I thought he looked great,"" said Wade, the Heat expert on fashion. ""I thought it was great that coach always preaches to players to get out of their comfort zone, and tonight he had to get out of his comfort zone. It was amazing."" Anthony Davis finished with 41 points for the Pelicans, who got 21 from Jrue Holiday and 15 from Nikola Mirotic. New Orleans has never rallied from more than 23 down to win a game, but made this one far more interesting than Miami wanted. ""When you get yourself down 30 and start mounting a comeback, you have to have a perfect storm,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""And it just doesn't exist. It's really disappointing because we competed like crazy from the second quarter on."" The Heat led by 20 after one quarter -- their biggest lead at home through 12 minutes since Jan. 30, 2007. The lead was 52-21 early in the second, and by then Richardson had 14 points, Wade had 11 and the Pelicans had missed all 11 of their 3-point attempts. Richardson's 3-pointer with 2:56 left in the half pushed Miami's lead to 59-28. And then things got interesting. New Orleans needed only 97 seconds for a 12-0 run that cut the deficit to 19, and the Pelicans went into the locker room down 61-41. Davis then scored the Pelicans' first 11 points of the second half with a jumper, two 3-pointer and three free throws after getting fouled on a 3 to get his team within 65-52. The Pelicans kept charging, but Miami never surrendered the lead. ""We know what we have to do,"" Davis said. ""We know we have to come out better instead of playing uphill."" TIP-INS Pelicans: E'Twaun Moore left with 1:34 left with what appeared to be a left knee injury, and was unable to put any weight on that leg as he was helped to the locker room. ... New Orleans is 9-2 at home, yet only 2-10 on the road. ... Davis now has three 40-point games this season. Heat: This is a stretch where Miami plays nine of 10 games against Western Conference teams. ... It was Miami's 390th consecutive home sellout, tying Phoenix (1990-99) for the seventh-longest in NBA history. ... Hassan Whiteside had 12 points for Miami, but didn't play in the fourth. HEAT INJURIES The Heat are up to 62 games missed by eight players with injuries -- Goran Dragic (right knee) remains out, Tyler Johnson (right hamstring) sat again, Dion Waiters (ankle surgery) hasn't played this season and Derrick Jones Jr. is now out with a right hamstring strain. COMEBACK TRY The largest halftime deficit ever overcome in Pelicans' history was 19 -- they were the New Orleans Hornets then -- at Memphis on Jan. 30, 2010. When trailing by 20 or more at the half, New Orleans is now 0-38.","401071005"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder went against the numbers and made it work. The worst 3-point shooting team in the NBA by percentage, Oklahoma City made a season-high 18 on 41 attempts in a 124-109 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. Russell Westbrook, who made a pair of 3s, fell a rebound short of a triple-double. He finished with 23 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. Alex Abrines scored 21 points on seven 3-pointers, Paul George had 20 points and Dennis Schroder added 18. Thunder forward Patrick Patterson, who made three 3-pointers, said the way Oklahoma City got the 3s was critical. ""The guys did a great job finishing at the basket,"" he said. ""That made opportunities throughout the course of the game for all of us to take open shots. All of us had great looks. Despite them going in or not, our teammates still find us and they don't just take it upon themselves to score. It shows how much we believe in one another."" John Collins and Alex Len each scored 19 points for Atlanta, and Taurean Prince added 15. Hawks guard Trae Young had nine points and eight assists on 4-for-15 shooting in his return to his home state. ""You know, it's tough,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""The ball just keeps going in and out for him."" Young was an All-American at Oklahoma last season, and he received a nice ovation during starting lineup introductions. He grew up attending Thunder games, so he knew what to expect. ""Of course, I know how hard it is for a team to come in here and get a win,"" he said. ""And with as good as the team is over there on that side, the crowd is one of the best in the league."" The Thunder took control in the second quarter by making 7 of 13 3-pointers to take a 66-46 lead at the break. George scored 19 points, and Westbrook had 15 in the first half. ""We didn't make plays,"" Young said. ""Couldn't make plays, couldn't get stops, turning the ball over a lot. They just got on a run and we just couldn't stop it."" The Hawks got it going in the third quarter and cut the deficit to 10 before Abrines answered with a 3-pointer. The Thunder pushed their advantage back out to 91-76 by the end of the period. Patterson hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth to bump Oklahoma City's lead back up to 20. ""We had great pace,"" Schroder said. ""We put pressure on the rim. Everybody found open teammates. Everybody knocked them down tonight."" TIP-INS Hawks: Young got a technical in the second quarter after complaining to an official. ... Atlanta's Vince Carter got a technical from the bench in the third quarter. He did not play. ... Collins also had 11 rebounds.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The Houston Rockets are starting to feel whole, and they demonstrated that by taking apart the San Antonio Spurs. Clint Capela had 27 points and 12 rebounds, James Harden had 23 points and 10 assists and Houston handed San Antonio its second straight lopsided defeat, 136-105 on Friday night. Chris Paul added 14 points and 10 assists as Houston was able to sit its starters for most of the fourth quarter while holding a 110-74 lead after the third. Paul returned after a three-game absence and Gerald Green played after missing two straight. ""We're a confident group that when we have all of our players and we've got a healthy roster we can compete with anybody in the league,"" Harden said. The Rockets entered the game on a four-game skid, but the Spurs were the troubled team. Two nights after a 39-point loss in Minnesota, San Antonio actually fared worse against Houston. ""It sucks to go out there and get embarrassed like that (back to back),"" said Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, who had 18 points. San Antonio suffered its second-largest home loss in franchise history and fell two games below .500 (10-12) for the first time since Nov. 20, 2009, when it was 4-6. The Spurs have allowed 135-plus points four times this season, the most in the league. San Antonio entered the season having allowed 135 points in just two games in 22 previous seasons under coach Gregg Popovich. ""We're obviously discombobulated on offense,"" Popovich said. ""A lot of that has to do with me, so I've got to do a better job there. I think defensively we've obviously got to shore up our effort and our wisdom at that end of the court. We've got a lot of work to do."" The Spurs allowed their biggest point total in a half this season and matched the most they have allowed in the third quarter. Houston scored 70 points in the first half. Harden set the mark by driving the lane untouched with 3.7 seconds left for a layup. The Rockets added 40 points in the third quarter. Houston finished 22 for 54 on 3-pointers. The Rockets went on an 18-4 run beginning midway through the first quarter and raced to a 31-15 lead. ""We talked on defense a lot better and we pushed the tempo,"" Paul said. ""Like I've always said, when I'm out, we're a different team. When James is out, when Eric (Gordon) is out, when any of us is out, we're a different team. Tonight, I think we got a chance to alleviate a little bit of pressure from one another."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston is 9-6 after opening the season 1-5. ... Houston's 70 points in the first half tied its second most in any half. The Rockets scored 76 against Indiana on Nov. 11 and 70 against Detroit on Nov. 21. ... Paul has missed five games this season, all of which Houston lost. ... James Ennis was assessed a technical foul after screaming at an official after he was whistled for a pushing foul with 7:38 remaining in the third quarter. Spurs: DeRozan is the first San Antonio player to score in double figures in each of his first 22 games since David Robinson did so as a rookie in 1989. ... The most points the Spurs previously allowed in the first half was 68 to New Orleans on Nov. 3. ... Only Roger Mason Jr., Richard Jefferson and Manu Ginobili have made more 3-pointers after 22 games than Bryn Forbes, who has 50. ... Marco Belinelli has 245 3-pointers for the Spurs, the most he has made for any of the nine teams he has played for. STAYING TOGETHER DeRozan was asked if the team could stick together following consecutive blowout losses. ""No question, no question,"" DeRozan said. ""I think our frustration defensively just comes from losing the way we did, but not in no way, shape or form is it going to break us."" NO COMMENT Houston coach Mike D'Antoni joked that Capela would likely not want to talk after he exited the game in the third quarter with 12 rebounds when his career high of 25 was attainable. ""Oh really, he said that,"" Capela said. ""No, he didn't say that. He didn't say that. He didn't say that. He did (laughing)? That's OK. Good win.

"PHOENIX --  Nikola Vucevic knew he faced a challenge against Phoenix Suns rookie Deandre Ayton in the post on Friday night. He also knew he'd have an advantage on offense. Vucevic deployed his veteran experience against this year's top overall draft pick and finished with 25 points and 15 rebounds as the Orlando Magic defeated the Suns 99-85. ""I was just trying to stay aggressive. For big men, it takes a little bit, especially on the defensive end, to kind of get a feel for it. The game is so fast,"" Vucevic said. ""He's going to be a real good player."" Terrence Ross added 21 points off the bench, and Aaron Gordon finished with 18 points, despite a sore back. D.J. Augustin scored 16 points. ""I was just playing slow,"" Gordon said. ""Playing old man game, except for playing above the rim. I still dunked it."" Ayton scored 19 points and Jamal Crawford had 18 as the Suns lost their fourth straight and for the seventh time in eight games. Ross made the first three baskets of the fourth quarter to give the Magic an 81-71 lead, and Orlando built the lead from there. Vucevic hit a hook shot with two minutes to play that pushed the lead to 98-83. The Suns were without their top two scorers, star guard Devin Booker and forward TJ Warren, both out with injuries. Josh Jackson, who started in place of Warren, struggled through a 5-for-21 shooting night and was hit with a technical foul late in the third quarter. ""I do definitely feel obligated to pick up the slack a little bit. We all do,"" Jackson said. ""We know whenever Devin or TJ doesn't play, our two leading scorers, we have a lot to make up for it."" The Magic went ahead by 10 early in the third quarter on a layup by  Vucevic, and his 3-pointer with 3:40 left gave the Magic a 73-61 lead. The Suns closed within 75-71 when Crawford hit a jumper just before the third-quarter buzzer. Ross hit back-to-back 3-pointers gave the Magic a 27-25 lead in the second quarter after Orlando trailed by four at the end of the first. Ross scored 11 points in the quarter and Orlando led by as many as six, its largest lead of the first half. ""He takes the shots that he can make,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said of Ross. Crawford's 3 with 29.7 seconds left in the half had the Suns trailing 51-48 at the intermission. Crawford made three 3-pointers and scored 11 points in the second quarter. Phoenix held an eight-point lead in the first quarter, its largest of the game, before the Magic rallied. ""Sometimes I wonder `How do we lose?' Ayton said. ""It feels like everybody is competing. It's kind of confusing because I know everybody was playing hard today, but we still lose."" TIP-INS Magic: Orlando won its fourth straight against Phoenix. ... Vucevic has scored 20 or more points in four straight games. Suns: Crawford tied Charles Oakley for 25th in NBA history in career games played when he entered Friday's game.

Phoenix threw down five dunks in the game. ROOKIE MATCHUP Ayton, the top overall pick in this year's NBA Draft, got the better of a lottery-pick matchup with fellow rookie Mo Bamba of Orlando. Bamba was the sixth overall pick and second center taken after Ayton, and finished with two points. Bamba had a powerful two-handed slam in the fourth quarter for his only basket.","401071008"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers were stuck in neutral for most of the first half against Dallas. Then they ramped up their defense and rallied for a second win in as many nights, posting a 114-103 victory over the Mavericks on Friday night. ""From the second quarter on, our defense stepped up. We did a nice job of getting stops and getting out and running,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We found our energy and were able to carry it on from there. It was ugly in the first. We weren't able to get back in transition and had too many turnovers."" Dallas shot 12 of 25 from the field in the first quarter and then shot just 36 percent (22 of 61) the rest of the game. The Lakers (13-9) had a 31-13 advantage in fast-break points and outscored the Mavericks 62-40 in the paint. LeBron James missed five of six from the field in the first quarter before going 11 of 15 the rest of the way and finishing with 28 points. ""I knew what type of basketball I played in the first quarter and the result of that was us playing poor. I hit the reset button and knew I would be much better,"" James said. Brandon Ingram added 19 points and was lauded by Walton for holding Dallas rookie Luka Doncic to six points and 2 of 13 from the field. ""We tried to contest every shot that he took, whether it was going to the lane, midrange or 3-pointers,"" Ingram said. Kyle Kuzma added 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Lakers. It's the third time in five back-to-back sets this season that they have taken both games.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  With some three minutes left in a tight game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Paul Millsap gathered the Denver Nuggets for a pep talk. Nuggets coach Michael  Malone set the scene, explaining that Millsap ""went out and grabbed the guys in the huddle and said `We've talked about being a playoff team but if we're really going to be a playoff team this is one we need to get."" The Nuggets, who had led by as many as 17 in the game, went on to withstand a frenzied final few minutes to edge the Blazers 113-112 on Friday night. It was Denver's fifth straight win. Millsap finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds while Gary Harris, who missed Denver's last two games with a sore left ankle, had 27 points -- including a crucial 3-pointer in the final minute. But Harris also pointed to the words the normally reserved Millsap said to the team in the huddle as the difference in the game. ""He said if we're gonna be a playoff team it's time to show everybody. For him to open his mouth like that it shocked a lot of people,"" Harris said. ""That was big and it got us over the hump. He's our vet. He's our leader."" CJ McCollum had 33 points, but missed a jumper at the final buzzer as the Blazers came up just short. Jusuf Nurkic added 17 points and 11 rebounds for Portland, which has lost four of its last five games. The Blazers started to chip away at Denver's lead late in the third quarter. McCollum's jumper got Portland within 98-97 with 6:04 left but Monte Morris answered with a 3-pointer for the Nuggets and the Blazers couldn't get any closer until Nurkic's basket with 1:30 left counted on a goaltending call to close the gap to 108-106. McCollum added step-back jumper to tie it at 108 with less than a minute left. Jamal Murray made a pair of free throws for Denver before McCollum came through again with a layup to re-tie it with 37.1 seconds left -- but Harris nailed a corner 3-pointer to put the Nuggets in front 113-110. McCollum dunked on the other end and Murray was called out of bounds after the inbound to give Portland back the ball. After a review, the call was overturned. The game clock was re-set to 6.9 seconds and Murray was again called out of bounds on the inbound, but McCollum's jumper at the buzzer was off to end it. ""I saw CJ and he got a good look, it just didn't fall,"" Damian Lillard said about the final play. ""A lot of things we could have done to not be in that position, but we had our shot. It just didn't fall."" It was the first of a five-game road trip for the Nuggets, who were coming off of a 117-85 victory at home over the L.A. Lakers. Harris hit a 3-pointer that capped a 14-2 run that put the Nuggets in front 28-17 late in the first quarter. Denver led by as many as 14 points in the opening period. Meyers Leonard had an emphatic dunk over Mason Plumlee as Portland struggled to close the gap. McCollum got the Blazers within single digits with a layup that made it 53-45, but Harris' layup and free throw extended Denver's lead again. Millsap had 16 first-half points and the Nuggets went into the break with a 68-53 lead.  Portland was hurt by 10 turnovers. The Trail Blazers snapped a three-game losing streak with a 115-112 victory over Orlando on Wednesday. Lillard had 41 points in the game, including a franchise-record 10 3-pointers. But against the Nuggets he was cold at the start with just five first-half points. He finished with 15. TIP INS: Nuggets: It was the first of four games between the two teams this season. Denver won last year's series 3-1. ... The Nuggets held opponents under 100 points in each of the previous three games. Trail Blazers: Nurkic played for the Nuggets for more than two seasons before he was traded to Portland in early 2017. ... Portland has lost four straight to the Nuggets. ENEMY TERRITORY: ""I like when the crowds really going. It gets me going. It gets me excited to hush them up. I've always been that guy. I like playing in hostile environments. When they get loud it gets me going. It's amazing,"" Harris said.","401071010"
"NEW YORK --  In one locker room, the New York Knicks spoke about the fight they displayed over 53 minutes against the NBA's highest scoring team. Down the hallway, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo was fighting mad. ""One thing about our team is that we're always going to fight,"" Emmanuel Mudiay said after he scored 28 points to lead the Knicks to a 136-134 overtime win over Milwaukee on Saturday. ""We don't play the scoreboard. That's the one thing coach (David Fizdale) always preaches."" Rookie forward Kevin Knox scored a career-high 26 points as New York snapped a two-game losing streak. Damyean Dotson and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 21 points each. Noah Vonleh contributed 15 points. ""It was good to see the ball go in the net,"" said Knox, who had been the subject of criticism for his play. ""It felt good. Just (have) to keep working (and) never get too high, never get too low."" While the Knicks were reveling in one of their most satisfying wins of the season, Antetokounmpo was vowing vengeance for an act he perceived as disrespect. Antetokounmpo was angry at Knicks forward Mario Hezonja, who early in the first quarter dunked on the Milwaukee star, then stared and stepped over him -- much to the delight of the Madison Square Garden crowd. ""I'm going to punch him in the (groin) next time,"" said Antetokounmpo, who had 33 points and 19 rebounds. The teams next meet Christmas day in New York. Hezonja, who was unaware of Antetokounmpo's words, did note the crowd reaction to his only bucket of the game. ""Honestly, if you're afraid, this is not for you,"" Hezonja said. ""I don't want to be disrespectful but if you feel fear, this is not the place for you. New York Is not a place for you and this team is not a place for you."" Eric Bledsoe added 27 points for Milwaukee, which has lost three of its last five. Malcolm Brogdon finished with 22 points, Brook Lopez had 13, and Khris Middleton and Tony Snell each chipped in with 10. ""We got up a couple different times but didn't have the focus or determination to take it to the next level,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. New York took its first lead since Hardaway's 3-pointer midway through the first quarter on Enes Kanter's jumper from the wing 3:13 into the third period, giving the Knicks a 71-70 advantage. But that lead didn't last long as Milwaukee went on a 17-0 run before Knox hit a 3-pointer. The Bucks led by as many as 16 points before the Knicks rallied, scoring the last seven points of the quarter and cutting the deficit to four at 97-93. Mitchell Robinson opened the fourth quarter with a layup as the Knicks closed within two, but Antetokounmpo converted a three-point play, Sterling Brown added a four-point play and Brogdon hit a 3-pointer as Milwaukee pushed the lead to eight, 107-99. Moments later, Brown scored on a layup and extended the lead to 113-99. ""We've been competing a lot throughout this whole year. We lost a lot of games that have been down to one, two, three (points), so we're going to compete to the end of the game,"" Knox said. ""We just kept fighting, competing and we just made sure that we kept chopping at the lead."" Indeed. The Knicks outscored Milwaukee 25-11 in the final 6:39 to force overtime. Mudiay hit a 3-pointer that tied the game at 124-all before the Knicks forced Antetokounmpo into a shot-clock violation, setting up the extra session. ""We're just trying to get the best shot available,"" Mudiay said. ""That's a part of growing up."" Antetokounmpo hit a free throw that started the scoring in overtime, and New York responded with a 3-pointer by Mudiay that gave the Knicks a 127-125 lead. Bledsoe tied the game with a layup, but Mudiay answered again with another 3. Bledsoe hit a 3-pointer that tied the game at 130-all, then Antetokounmpo scored Milwaukee's next four points, sandwiched around a Hardaway jumper as the Bucks to a 134-132 lead. Following a timeout, Dotson knocked down a 3-pointer that gave the Knicks a 135-134 edge. Antetokounmpo missed a runner in the lane, and a Mudiay hit a free throw that pushed New York's advantage to 136-134. ""He kind of took it on himself and really willed it,"" Fizdale said of Mudiay. ""He shared the game, but he really willed that for us."" On the next possession, Robinson blocked Bledsoe's driving layup, forcing a jump ball. Antetokounmpo won the tip, and Lopez was fouled. He missed both free throws, and Antetokounmpo's last attempt under the basket was blocked by Kanter. ""I was just trying to get inside ... and shoot over the guy guarding me,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""The guy was coming from the baseline, so I tried to go middle and raise up."" TIP-INS: BUCKS: Antetokounmpo also recorded a team-high seven assists. He has led Milwaukee in assists nine times this season. Antetokounmpo was three assists away from recording his third triple-double of the season, and the 12th of his career. KNICKS: During his pregame press briefing, Fizdale said Courtney Lee could make his 2018-19 debut against the Bucks, depending on circumstances in the game. However, Lee did not step onto the court and has missed the first 24 games of the season with neck spasms. ""He's gotten a few days under his belt with real contact,"" Fizdale said of Lee, who began practicing with the Knicks last week. ""I think all of us feel comfortable with it. Honestly, either way, it's not like I'm throwing him out there for a lot of minutes."" . New York lost guard Trey Burke Jr. for the game with 4:54 left in the first quarter with a sprained right knee after he landed awkwardly on a layup attempt. A team spokesman said X-rays were negative. GROWING PAINS: In the first season under Fizdale, the historically quick-fix Knicks are undergoing the early stages of a rebuilding process. And they appear to have a fan in Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer. ""They're a hard-working, competitive group,"" Budenholzer said in his pregame media availability. ""Got a mix of, you know, a few veterans and some young guys. They play hard. Well coached. I think Tim Hardaway Jr. can get going. Put a lot of buckets up. (Enes) Kanter inside is a physical presence. Trey Burke and different guys -- (rookie guard Allonzo) Trier has had a great rookie year -- so I think different nights can be different guys. Impressed with what they doing."" While Budenholzer was praiseworthy, Fizdale was more straightforward in his analysis of his team. ""Get better,"" Fizdale said. ""We (have) one message (and) it (doesn't) matter where we are: Are we getting better? Are we competing at our highest levels? Are we growing each game from what we've been through before?"" ETC. Prior to the national anthem, there was a moment of silence for George H.W. Bush, who passed away Friday night. . Among the 19,812 in attendance were former Knicks Dick Barnett, Latrell Sprewell, Michael Ray Richardson; actors Dustin Hoffman, Emily Ratajkowski, Kelly AuCoin and Ben Sinclair; radio host Howard Stern; comedian Jon Stewart; and rappers GZA, Biz Markie and Vinnie Brown.","401071011"
"DETROIT --  Golden State got Stephen Curry back on Saturday night. Even that wasn't enough for the Warriors against Detroit's Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. Griffin scored 26 points and Drummond added 16 points and 19 rebounds as the Pistons extended their winning streak to five games with a 111-102 victory over the Warriors. ""That's obviously a great win,"" Griffin said. ""You could tell by the crowd and the atmosphere tonight that we were facing a big team, and we protected our home floor."" Drummond finished with eight offensive boards. ""It is so tough to play Andre, because when they get some penetration, the bigs normally try to help, but if you take your body off him for a second, he's going to get the rebound,"" Kevin Durant said. Detroit had six players score in double figures, including reserves Stanley Johnson and Ish Smith. ""Our guys understand their roles and they are accepting the role and being the most valuable player they can in that role,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We're playing with energy and we were able to beat the champs on a night when we only shot 44 percent and 34 percent from the line. ""We know we can play better than this."" Curry returned after missing 11 games with a groin strain and scored 27 points on 10-of-21 shooting, including 20 in the second half. Curry went 3 of 9 from 3-point range. ""It felt good to be back out there, but in the first half, I was going 100 miles an hour without my timing being back,"" he said. ""In the second half, I played a lot closer to where I want to be. The shots started falling and I was aggressive without making stupid plays."" Golden State coach Steve Kerr blamed himself for the defeat, which saw the Pistons finish with 12 3-pointers and 14 offensive rebounds to Golden State's six and eight, respectively. ""This has to go down as one of the worst games I've ever coached,"" he said. ""We got into some foul trouble early, and I was searching for a lineup that could match up with Blake and Andre, and I never gave us an effective group. We weren't shooting 3s or getting to the glass."" Durant scored 28 points for Golden State, and Klay Thompson added 21. ""I think our spacing is screwed up, and we aren't playing with enough urgency,"" Durant said. ""None of that is on coach. That's our fault."" Curry missed his first three shots, all 3-pointers, but drove to the basket for a three-point play on the first possession of the second quarter. Detroit led by as many as 11 points in the second and led 54-46 at halftime. Stanley Johnson had 13 points off the bench for the Pistons, while Thompson and Durant combined for 25 for Golden State. Curry had seven on 2-of-9 shooting, missing all five 3-pointers. ""We played a terrible first half, and that pretty much summed up the night,"" Curry said. ""They are playing really well and we didn't do anything to take them out of their comfort zone."" The Pistons moved the margin to 14 points, 69-55, on Reggie Jackson's three-point play midway through the third, but Curry answered with his first 3-pointer of the game. The Warriors were as close as two late in the quarter, but Johnson's 3-pointer at the buzzer gave the Pistons an 85-78 lead going into the fourth. ""We've usually got Blake out there with the second unit, but today we were playing without him and were able to stretch the lead,"" Johnson said. ""We were getting the ball to Ish on the break and letting him make plays, but we were mostly just playing really, really hard."" The Pistons led 96-87 with 4:15 to play when the Warriors began to intentionally foul Drummond, who had missed 17 of his last 20 free throws. Detroit coach Dwane Casey pulled him, and the Pistons moved the lead back to 14. After returning, Drummond split a pair of free throws with 1:17 left, and is now 4 for 22 in his last four games. TIP INS Warriors: Golden State was 10-2 when Curry got hurt, but lost six of the 11 games he missed. . The Warriors lost for the third time in 33 games when Durant, Thompson and Curry scored at least 20 points in the same game. Pistons: The Pistons have won two straight against Golden State after losing 12 of their previous 13 games against the Warriors. . After shooting 38.1 percent from the line in his first five seasons, Drummond improved to 60.5 percent last season. This year, though, he is back down to 47.2 percent.

"WASHINGTON --  Since starting the season with seven losses in eight games, the Washington Wizards have stabilized. They've gone 8-7 since then, but haven't been able to make up ground in the standings. After the Wizards' 102-88 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night, they improved their home record to 7-5. But, they've lost nine of 11 on the road, and with a four-game trip beginning Monday night in New York against the Knicks, they know they'll have to play much better away from the Nation's Capital. ""In order to be a good team, a great team, we have to be able to win on the road,"" Bradley Beal said. ""If we want to have success down the road, that's something we're going to have to do."" After their game in New York, Washington plays at Atlanta, Cleveland and then Indiana. Of the four, only the Pacers currently own a winning record. ""The biggest thing for us is putting a streak together -- regardless of whether it's on the road or at home,"" Beal said. The Wizards won handily, their fourth double-digit win. John Wall scored 30 points, Beal added 22. It was Brooklyn's sixth straight loss. ""We weren't sharp,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well. Funny, I thought our defense was decent."" Allen Crabbe led Brooklyn with 14 points. The losing streak is the Nets' longest since an eight-game skid in February. At 88 points, the Nets -- coming off a double-overtime home loss to Memphis on Friday night -- had their lowest-scoring game of season. It also was the lowest total the Wizards have allowed. The Wizards took the lead midway through the first quarter and used an 11-0 run to start the second half and take an 53-39 lead with 9:09 to play in the third quarter.

"CLEVELAND -- Down an All-Star guard, there was no need for the Toronto Raptors to panic. Not against one of the NBA's worst teams, and not with Kawhi Leonard around. Leonard scored 34 points, Fred VanVleet added 15, and Toronto extended its win streak to eight games, despite missing Kyle Lowry, with a 106-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday. Danny Green and Pascal Siakam added 15 apiece as the Raptors improved the league's best record to 20-4, reaching the 20-win mark more quickly than at any other time in their history. Toronto also is a league-best 10-2 on the road. Lowry missed his first game this season with an unspecified back injury. Raptors coach Nick Nurse didn't provide any details about Lowry's back other than to say it flared up earlier in the day. Leonard didn't learn until just before tip-off that Lowry, the league's assist leader, wouldn't play. ""I told him he should have let me know earlier because I would have slept 20 more minutes,"" Leonard joked. ""I needed that energy tonight."" VanVleet started in place of Lowry, ran Toronto's offense and organized the Raptors defensively. He also made the game's biggest shot, dropping a back-breaking 3-pointer with 2:08 left to put Toronto up 10. VanVleet joked that he was the only one happy Lowry didn't dress. ""I didn't miss him at all,"" he said, chuckling. ""Any time I can get extra minutes and extra shots up, I'm happy."" Jordan Clarkson scored 18 points, and Tristan Thompson had 18 points and 19 rebounds for the Cavs. They hung around but lost their fourth in a row and dropped to 4-18. Cleveland, which sustained its worst loss of the season on Friday in Boston, did get healthier, as starting guard George Hill returned after missing 11 games with a sprained right shoulder. He scored eight points in 19 minutes. Toronto was making its first visit to Quicken Loans Arena since May, when the Raptors were swept in four games by Cleveland in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Of course, that Raptors team didn't have Leonard, who came over in a July trade from San Antonio for DeMar DeRozan and has given Toronto fans hope that this might finally be the year. ""It's not just Kawhi that makes them different,"" Hill said. ""You get another amazing defender in Danny Green, a laser 3-point shooter in him, and they got experience now. Losing a guy like DeMar is tough, but at the same time, you replace him with a guy of the same caliber like Kawhi, but also adding a guy like Danny, who is playoff-tested, championship-proven, that just makes them an overall better team."" TIP-INS Raptors: Reached 20 wins in 26 games in 2014-15. ... Came in shooting a league-best 41 percent on 3-pointers the past five games but went only 7-of-26 behind the arc. ...

Although Hill is back, coach Larry Drew will keep rookie Collin Sexton in the starting lineup. ""It gives us another ball handler on the floor, another guy who can make plays,"" Drew said.

"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets aren't where they want to be, but are feeling much better after following a season-high four game skid with consecutive wins, capped by Saturday night's victory over the Chicago Bulls. James Harden made six 3-pointers and scored 30 points to help the Rockets down the Bulls 121-105. The victory comes a night after the Rockets ended their losing streak with a win 136-105 win at San Antonio. Now coach Mike D'Antoni is looking for his team to maintain this momentum on its upcoming three-game road trip. ""We need to go show everybody who we need to be,"" D'Antoni said. ""We may not be there yet but we're getting there ... we just need to go get some wins."" Harden said health is the biggest reason why Houston has played better recently. ""It's just having a full roster,"" he said. ""Chris (Paul), Gerald (Green) and Nene coming back in these last few games. Having a full roster and guys that can help each other out is key."" Houston was up by 12 entering the fourth quarter and used a 13-7 run to start the period and make it 100-82 with 8 1/2 minutes left. Eric Gordon made two 3-pointers in that stretch and P.J. Tucker added a three-point play. Chicago couldn't cut into the lead after that and the Rockets were up by 20 with about three minutes left when D'Antoni cleared the bench. Zach LaVine had 29 points for the Bulls, who lost their sixth straight game and for the 10th time in 11 games. Chicago's Lauri Markkanen had 10 points and four rebounds in his season debut after missing the team's first 23 games with a sprained right elbow he sustained in training camp. He entered the game with about 4 1/2 minutes left in the first quarter and played 26 minutes. ""I felt good and I had no problems with my elbow,"" he said. ""That's a positive. I was just glad to be out there."" Clint Capela added 18 points and 15 rebounds for Houston and Paul had 12 points and tied a season high with 13 assists in his second game back after missing three with a sore hamstring. Houston led by 10 at halftime before the Bulls used a 12-6 run to open the third quarter and cut the lead to four. Parker led Chicago in that stretch, scoring eight points. The Rockets got back on track after that, scoring the next five points to push the lead to 67-58 with about seven minutes left in the third. ""Coming out of the break, I thought we had great momentum in the second half, and they throw in a couple of bombs,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We have to keep fighting and work on being more consistent."" Houston led by eight later in the third when Harden made a 3-pointer just before the shot clock expired to make it 74-63 with 4 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. The Bulls added a layup seconds after that, but Houston scored the next six points, capped by a 3 from Harden with Jabari Parker in his face to make it 80-65 about 90 seconds later. LaVine scored all of Chicago's points in a 7-2 run later in the third to cut the deficit, but Green made a 3-pointer with a few seconds left in the quarter to put Houston up 87-75 entering the fourth.

"MINNEAPOLIS -- That gruesome ankle injury that put Gordon Hayward through a grueling year of rehab forced him to adjust his game. However he's able to make it happen, the Boston Celtics are more than happy to have him making the significant impact they envisioned all along. Hayward had a season-high 30 points and added nine rebounds and eight assists, helping the revived Celtics win their third straight game by staving off the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-109 on Saturday. With Kyrie Irving in command of their drive-and-kick offense and their typical well-rounded effort on defense, the Celtics picked up another quality win behind a breakout performance by Hayward. ""It's slowly coming along. I think my confidence is slowly coming back, too,"" Hayward said. ""I'm still not where I want to be, but for sure, me attacking is better for our team and not being hesitant or passive."" Derrick Rose scored 26 points for the Timberwolves, who fell to 9-4 at home and 7-3 since trading All-Star Jimmy Butler. Karl-Anthony Towns had 20 points and nine rebounds, and Robert Covington had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Wolves, who allowed more than 103 points for the first time in eight games and saw their four-game win streak stopped. ""They're a great team, so they made us pay for those mistakes,"" Towns said. The signs of this game for Hayward were evident to the Celtics in practice three days prior, with his more aggressive mindset with the ball. His teammates playfully doused him with water as they walked by his postgame television interview. ""This has not been easy for him, and all he's done is grit his teeth and been a great teammate and worked hard,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""I think there's a lot to be said about that. The year didn't start the way he wanted to. He's not starting. But I think that he has helped set the example for what this team needs to be about."" Hayward, who hit the 30-point mark for the first time since he scored 33 points for Utah on May 4, 2017, in the playoffs against Golden State, scored 11 of Boston's final 15 points over the last three-and-a-half minutes of the game and made four of five shots from 3-point range. Irving pitched in 21 points and nine assists, Jayson Tatum added 19 points and nine rebounds, and Marcus Morris had 16 points on 4-for-7 shooting from 3-point range for the Celtics. They lost eight of 12 games before starting their streak. ""Now we're just playing. Gordon's being Gordon now. Guys are competing on both ends of the floor,"" Irving said. After beating San Antonio by 39 points on Wednesday, the third-largest margin of victory in franchise history, the Wolves played just well enough to stay within striking distance the whole game and just lackluster enough to lose. Six of their 16 turnovers were traveling calls, part sloppy footwork and part bad luck. ""I don't think we played with great energy,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Rose, who could find himself in a contest this spring with Hayward for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award, did his best to provide the energy and production off the bench. He opened the fourth quarter by sinking a midrange jumper and hit a 3-pointer to bring the Wolves within 89-86. On their next possession, his bounce pass through traffic in the lane set up Gorgui Dieng for a three-point play and a tie game for the first time since early in the second quarter. But after the Wolves cut it to 103-101 on Covington's pair of free throws, Hayward took over. ""That's a playoff-bound team. We're trying to get back in the playoffs again, so games like that just test where you're at,"" Wolves forward Taj Gibson said. ""We've got a couple more coming up, but that one still leaves a bad taste in your mouth."" TOUGH TRAVEL The Celtics are in the middle of a rough, monthlong stretch of the schedule without consecutive home games and with eight of 13 contests on the road. This visit to Minnesota, the night after playing at home in Boston, was their eighth road game against a Western Conference team this season. TIP-INS Celtics: Forward Jaylen Brown missed his third straight game because of a bruised lower back. He warmed up before tipoff but was still too sore to suit up. ... Backup center Aron Baynes had five fouls in 16 minutes. Timberwolves: After missing 17 of 18 shots, including all 10 of his 3-point attempts, against Chicago a week ago, Covington has gone 20-for-38 from the floor and 10-for-23 from 3-point range the past three games. ... Wiggins had 17 points on 5-for-12 shooting.","401071016"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Sacramento Kings have already established themselves as a fairly solid offensive team this season with their quick-paced scoring attack. Every now and then, they show signs of being pretty good on defense, too. Willie Cauley-Stein scored on a putback dunk with 16.1 seconds left, Sacramento held Indiana to one bucket over the final 3 minutes and the Kings held on to beat the Pacers 111-110 on Saturday night. ""At the end of the game we were able get the stops that we needed, Willie made a big play and we got another stop,"" Kings guard De'Aaron Fox said. ""That's all it comes down to. When we're able to buckle down and get stops when we need them, we put ourselves in pretty good shape."" Bogdan Bogdanovic had 20 points and Cauley-Stein finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds to help the Kings end a four-game losing streak to the Pacers. Buddy Hield added 18 points, five rebounds and four assists. Both teams exchanged leads throughout the game until Sacramento closed the fourth quarter on an 8-3 run capped by Cauley-Stein's dunk. Darren Collison made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 1:12 remaining to put Indiana up 110-107. Fox followed with a steal and layup to pull Sacramento within one. After a turnover, Fox missed a short jumper that Cauley-Stein caught and jammed back in for the game-winner. ""I just trusted the play,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""Shaking through gave me that position on the back side to where I was able to make a play on a missed shot. I thought it was going in, to be real. It was one of those things where I need this, we need this."" Indiana had multiple chances to win but Bojan Bogdanovic and Collison both missed jumpers in the final 15 seconds. ""We turned the ball over way too much,"" Collison said. ""We didn't necessarily keep things simple. We have to be precise in everything you do. You have to be strong with the ball and it's something we didn't do, including myself."" Bojan Bogdanovic had a season-high 27 points for the Pacers. Collison added 11 points and 12 assists. Indiana continues to play without leading scorer Victor Oladipo, who missed his seventh straight game while recovering from a sore right knee. McDermott, Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young scored 14 apiece for Indiana. The Pacers trailed early in the fourth quarter then went ahead after Domantas Sabonis and Doug McDermott combined for 12 consecutive points capped by McDermott's driving layup. Sacramento took over after that and outscored Indiana 8-3 while holding the Pacers to 1 of 9 shooting down the stretch ""There were some stretches where some things didn't go well for us, made some mistakes, but we kept coming and we were relentless,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We got some stops at the end, which was critical."" TIP-INS Pacers: Former Kings first-round draft pick Tyreke Evans had 12 points and four assists while starting in place of Oladipo. ... Indiana hadn't lost to Sacramento since Jan. 23, 2016. . The Pacers had a season-high 24 turnovers, six in the fourth quarter.

"LOS ANGELES --  Moritz Wagner drove for a layup to put the Los Angeles Lakers up by 31 points, and his teammates erupted off the bench in spontaneous glee for their German rookie's first NBA field goal. ""He learned how to ride a bike!"" LeBron James said afterward. ""That was that moment. You guys never rode a bike before? Yeah, we were excited. Very excited."" The Lakers had plenty of time for fun and frivolity after making easy work of the Phoenix Suns during the next win in an increasingly impressive season. Kyle Kuzma scored 23 points and James had 22 before both sat out the fourth quarter of the Lakers' third home victory in four days, 120-96 over the struggling Suns on Sunday. Brandon Ingram scored 15 points and JaVale McGee had 14 points and eight rebounds in three quarters of work for the Lakers, who have won 12 of 16 since their 2-5 start to James' first season on the West Coast. Michael Beasley scored a season-high 14 points for the Lakers. Although they fell behind by 17 points in the first quarter, they still made easy work of last-place Phoenix despite committing 19 turnovers. ""I was very happy with our defensive effort again,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""I thought we came out a little flat. Michael Beasley and the second unit did a really good job of getting us started, and then from that point on, the rest of the guys had a pretty solid game."" Richaun Holmes scored 15 points, and Josh Jackson and Trevor Ariza scored 13 apiece for the Suns, who have lost five straight to fall to 4-19. ""It's kind of hard not to focus on the record, but we've still got games to play,"" Jackson said. ""We show flashes of how good we could be. We just have to be able to start stringing those runs together and just be better all the time. The more consistent we get, the better we'll be."" No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton had 10 points and 10 rebounds, but the Suns couldn't build on their excellent first quarter. ""Obviously we can't be happy with the final result, but I thought we came ready to play, to compete,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""The first 10 minutes of the game, we can say that we looked like an organized group and we competed."" TIP-INS Suns: T.J. Warren missed his second straight game with ankle soreness, but Kokoskov doesn't think it's serious. Jackson started for the second straight game in Warren's place. ... Ariza, who spent two seasons with the Lakers from 2007-09, attended Westchester High School near the Lakers' training complex before going to UCLA. He got a warm ovation from Lakers fans, many of whom would love to land his services as a 3-point shooting specialist for their team. Lakers: Tyson Chandler had three points and 11 rebounds while facing the Suns for the first time since leaving Phoenix one month ago and signing with Los Angeles as a free agent. Chandler was an early mentor to Ayton. BOOKER DOWN Devin Booker scored six points before leaving with a strained left hamstring in the second quarter. Booker hurt his leg while chasing a loose ball out of bounds, going immediately to the locker room. Booker missed three games in October after straining his left hamstring in the Suns' first game against the Lakers. He was returning Sunday from a one-game absence due to an injured left toe after stubbing it on his hotel bed during the Suns' trip to Los Angeles to play the Clippers last Wednesday. Kokoskov had no immediate update on Booker's condition afterward. MOE SCORES Wagner scored the first 10 points of his NBA career in the fourth quarter of his fourth game for the Lakers. The first-round pick from Michigan and Berlin hit two free throws before getting his first field goal with 5:01 to play. He added a pair of 3-pointers a few moments later. The start of the 6-foot-11 Wagner's rookie season was slowed by a bruised knee in training camp. WAKE UP The Lakers didn't adapt well to the early start time, falling behind 25-8 in the opening seven minutes with a turnover-plagued beginning. But Kuzma and James sparked an abrupt turnaround late in the first quarter, and the Lakers made a prolonged 45-18 run to a 15-point lead late in the second. Los Angeles poured it on in the third, taking a 23-point lead with 10 point from James.","401071018"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Six years later, Anthony Davis still haunts the Charlotte Hornets. Davis had 36 points, 19 rebounds and eight assists, and the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Hornets 119-109 on Sunday. Davis is the franchise-changing player Charlotte had targeted in the 2012 draft after going 7-59 the previous season, the worst winning percentage in NBA franchise history. However, New Orleans defied the odds to win the draft lottery and took Davis No. 1 overall, while Charlotte was forced to settle on his former Kentucky teammate Michael Kidd-Gilchrist at No. 2. Davis is a five-time NBA All-Star, while Kidd-Gilchrist is a backup for the Hornets. The Hornets, and their fans, certainly remember the day when the ping pong balls didn't fall their way. Davis said he never thinks about what it would have been like to play in Charlotte, but he always seems to remind the fans and the organization -- whether consciously or not -- of what they missed out on with some of his best games coming against the Hornets. Sunday was no exception. When Davis wasn't scoring and rebound, he was facilitating. His assist numbers have increased this season as he's seeing more and more double teams. He's averaging 4.8 assists this year, more than double any of his previous six seasons in the NBA. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said Davis is doing a great job of taking what the defense is giving him and finding open teammates. ""If they're going to double-team him or, you know, even try to triple team him some, he's always been a willing passer,"" Gentry said. ""So he's going to pass the ball and he's going to make the right play."" Davis credits his teammates for stepping up and making more shots. Jrue Holiday added 19 points and eight assists for the Pelicans, who won for only the second time in seven games. ""He demands so much respect, especially on the court, just to be able to have one guy on him that's a tough matchup for any and everybody,"" Holiday said. ""The way that he finds people makes it easier on us honestly -- wide-open shots, drives to the basket, cuts."" Davis said the goal was to be aggressive from the start and set the tone. ""We've been getting off to slow starts and that's on our starters on both ends of the floor, so I just tried to be aggressive, whether that's for me or my teammates, and I just hope other guys follow, and they did,"" Davis said. Davis was 14 of 19 from the field and dominated on both ends of the floor. Frank Kaminsky led the Hornets with a season-high 19 points, although he struggled with guarding Davis in the paint. TIP INS Pelicans: Nikola Mirotic had 16 points and eight rebounds in the win, but was just 5 of 14 from the field. ... Julius Randle and Darius Miller each had 13 points off the bench. ... Had 30 assists. Hornets:  After starting the same lineup for the first 22 games, Willy Hernangomez got the start in place of Cody Zeller (ribs) at center. WALKER STRUGGLES Kemba Walker shook off an early sprained ankle and continued to play, but made just 5 of 16 shots and finished with 13 points. Walker opened the season with at least 26 points in 10 of the team's first 17 games including a 60-point game against the Philadelphia 76ers. However, he hasn't reached that mark in the six games since. ""Any type of injury like that you're just disrupted, you're uncomfortable,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""These are highly-skilled athletes and any type of tweak like that can be a disruption. But I think he would say `that wasn't a factor."" WILLIAMS INJURED With Zeller already out and Walker hobbling, it was a bad time for the Hornets to lose starting power forward Marvin Williams, who left the game with a shoulder injury in the second quarter and did not return. He left the arena with his right arm in a sling and will have more medical tests on Monday to determine the extent of the injury, Borrego said. ""This is what you deal with in the NBA,"" Borrego said of the sudden rash of injuries. WHERE'S BATUM Nic Batum, the team's highest-paid player at five years for $120 million, has struggled for most of the season and was limited to two points on 1-for-7 shooting and played just 14 minutes. Borrego said he needs to do a better job of making sure Batum is more involved in the offense.","401071019"
"MIAMI --  Dwyane Wade had a two-hour phone call with Donovan Mitchell over the summer, fielding question after question about what the path toward NBA stardom is like. Wade happily provided a ton of answers. He might have kept a secret or two for himself. Wade drove past Mitchell on Miami's final possession, drew a foul from Rudy Gobert at the rim and made two free throws with 3.2 seconds remaining to lift the Heat to a 102-100 win over the Utah Jazz on Sunday night -- a game where Mitchell's 3-pointer at the end hit the rim and bounced away. ""I don't talk to anybody on the phone for two hours anymore,"" Wade said. ""But he wanted to pick my brain. He had a lot of great questions and we just talked about the game."" Wade gave Mitchell a couple more lessons on Sunday, in a game where the Heat rallied from an early 19-point deficit and survived 17 lead changes and 16 ties. Hassan Whiteside scored 23 points and grabbed 20 rebounds for Miami, which got 16 apiece from Josh Richardson and Kelly Olynyk and 15 from Wade. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was waiting to see if Wade wanted a timeout on the last possession. He didn't, and Wade knew when he had the ball at the top of the key exactly what he was going to do -- drive down the right side of the lane, get to the rim and see what happens. ""It's like putting on an old glove,"" Spoelstra said. ""We've been in that situation so many times before. It was very natural for him to read everything."" Gobert didn't like the call. ""I just want it to be consistent at one point,"" Gobert said. ""Every night is the same (stuff)."" Ricky Rubio led Utah with 23 points. Jae Crowder scored 19 and Mitchell had 18 for the Jazz, on 8 for 24 shooting. Afterward, he said going head-to-head with Wade was special. ""That was surreal, to be honest,"" Mitchell said. Gobert had 12 points and 18 rebounds for the Jazz. Wayne Ellington had 12 points, all of them on 3-pointers -- including one with 2:03 left that gave Miami the lead, and the Heat wouldn't trail again. Utah's lead was 55-53 at the half, a score that would suggest the first 24 minutes were nip-and-tuck for both sides. Not exactly. The Jazz ran out to leads of 20-5 and 35-16, shooting 65 percent -- while holding Miami to 28 percent -- and turning the first six Heat turnovers of the night into 12 points. And then Utah suddenly went ice-cold. Miami went on a 20-0 run, forcing Utah into 14 consecutive missed shots, to turn the 19-point deficit into a one-point lead. ""We'll clean it up. It's little things,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Overall, I'm happy with how we competed, but obviously we wish we could do things better for a full game."" TIP-INS Jazz: Joe Ingles scored 11 for Utah, which put all five of its starters in double figures. ... The Jazz were trying to finish off a 3-0 road trip. ... Utah was 11 for 33 from 3-point range. Heat: The 20-0 run was Miami's longest of the season, topping a 17-0 streak at Chicago last month. ... The Heat were back in their red jerseys, a second consecutive deviation from the schedule. Miami was slated to wear its black ""Vice"" jerseys again Sunday, but much like Friday -- when the Heat snapped a six-game home slide that coincided with the unveiling of those kits -- the team went a different way. INJURY LIST Miami's injury list -- which already included Goran Dragic (knee), Tyler Johnson (hamstring), Derrick Jones Jr. (hamstring) and Dion Waiters (ankle surgery recovery) -- got deeper in the first half. Starting wing Rodney McGruder, one of Miami's top defenders, left with a sprained right ankle and did not return. ODD SCHEDULE It's a strange schedule this year for the Jazz, who have now played 24 games -- a league-high 16 on the road, a league-low eight at home. The first half of the year has Utah playing 25 times on the road, 16 at home, and obviously the exact inverse of that awaits the Jazz in the season's second half.","401071020"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons have started wearing white headbands -- yes, they are a headband of brothers -- as a symbol of their commitment to defense. But the 76ers stars wanted to make more than a fashion statement -- Butler and Simmons made a high-stakes pledge to D with a series of bets. Most steals. Most blocks. Simmons won the hand with two steals to Butler's one block. ""They gave (Joel Embiid) one of my blocks,"" Butler said. ""Technically, it's 2-2. So we'll push."" The box score tally may be in dispute but it's incontestable Butler has made the Sixers a true championship contender. Butler continued his run as Philadelphia's stretch-run shooter, scoring 13 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter to lead the 76ers to a 103-95 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday night. Butler hit winning shots against Charlotte and Brooklyn in eight days to quickly earn a reputation as Philly's newest go-to guard in the fourth. Against a Memphis team trying to steal one on the road, Butler hit a few more big buckets in the waning moments. Butler didn't need the final-minute theatrics to win this one. But he proved his worth and stunted Memphis' rally. Simmons, who had 19 points and 12 rebounds on a sprained left ankle, ran up from behind on MarShon Brooks and poked the ball free for a steal. That led to a pair of free throws for Butler that made it 95-89. Butler buried a turnaround jumper for a 97-89 lead that sealed the win. ""That's what the team needs me to do late, close out a couple of games,"" Butler said. ""It didn't come down to the buzzer-beater thing. I think all in all in the fourth quarter, I scored a few points."" Enough to take down Memphis. JJ Redick continued his late-career resurgence with 24 points for the Sixers and Embiid had 15 points and 14 rebounds. They all admire the way Butler has acclimated himself since his arrival last month in a trade with Minnesota. The Sixers are 13-1 at home and 8-2 since the Butler deal. ""Jimmy's an easy guy to have as a teammate,"" Redick said. ""He plays hard, he wants to win and he works his (rear) off."" Redick plugged his podcast, which drops later this week, for more of his thoughts on playing with Butler. Butler has tried to take Simmons under his wing and focus more on a defensive toughness. But they've been pretty good on offense, too Butler fed Simmons for a cutting layup in the first quarter and Simmons fed Butler on an alley-oop for an early spark. ""he knows how to play the game the right way and he's bought into our system,"" Simmons said. ""It's been pretty quick to get better with him."" With the rest of the NBA on a run-and-shoot style of soaring scores, the Grizzlies are grinding out wins in a methodical manner. They kept within striking distance of the Sixers and pulled to 84-81 in the fourth and Marc Gasol hit a 3 to make it 92-84 before Butler pushed them back. Mike Conley scored 21 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 17 for the Grizzlies. ""We're not in panic mode at all,"" Conley said. ""We've built ourselves a good little cushion to have a little spell like this. Hopefully, we'll just get back home, get back to work, get a few days in and get back together."" The Sixers had thumped New York by 16 and Washington by 25 as they rolled to the second-most wins in the NBA. Embiid and Simmons had formed one of the more potent 1-2 offensive punches in the NBA. Throw in Butler's two-way ability, and the Sixers have a newfound toughness. ""Whenever we're leading the charge on the defensive end, everybody's going to follow,"" Butler said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Had no offensive rebounds out of 17 total in the first half. ... ""They run their stuff well and I thought we limited them more, especially in the second half and made things more difficult for them,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. 76ers: Played without starting F Wilson Chandler (thigh). Chandler was not expected to miss another game. Mike Muscala got the start and scored eight points. ... Director M. Night Shyamalan was at the game. SIMMONS HURT Simmons said he was fine after leaving briefly in the first half with an injured ankle. He shot 8 of 10 from the floor.","401071021"
"DALLAS --  DeAndre Jordan said he didn't have any extra incentive Sunday night in his first meeting against his former team. His 23 rebounds might indicate otherwise. Jordan scored 16 points to go with his season-high rebound total, and Harrison Barnes had 30 points to help the Dallas Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 114-110. Dorian Finney-Smith tipped in a rebound with 35 seconds remaining to give Dallas the lead for good. Jordan, who played 10 seasons with Los Angeles before signing with Dallas as a free agent this offseason, downplayed the motivation to beat his former team. He talked instead about setting a tone for his own team with his rebounding. Dallas won the rebound battle 64-44 on Sunday. ""I know it's demoralizing to other teams -- playing defense and then having us get offensive rebounds,"" Jordan said. ""That sucks the life out of a team, little by little."" The game featured two loose-ball scraps between the Mavs' Dennis Smith Jr. and the Clippers' Patrick Beverley -- the first resulting in Smith losing part of a tooth, and the second in Beverley's ejection after a technical foul. Montrezl Harrell scored 23 points to lead the Clippers, and Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams each had 21. ""It was a game we should have won,"" Williams said. ""We didn't do a lot of things in our style of play."" Williams gave the Clippers just their second lead of the second half at 110-109 with a 3-pointer with 46.9 seconds left, before Barnes drove the lane and missed -- but Finney-Smith was there for a tip-in. Jordan then stole the ball from Williams and made one of two free throws for a 112-110 lead with 27.3 seconds to play. Smith blocked Tobias Harris' shot, gathered the ball and made the clinching free throws with 9.2 seconds left. ""That's winning stuff right there,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said of Smith's play. Dallas played without rookie Luka Doncic, who suffered a right hip strain Friday against the Lakers. Without a true wing off the bench, Barnes played 38 minutes. A TOOTH AND A TECH Smith and Beverley were involved in separate loose-ball scrambles in the third and fourth quarters, both resulting in jump balls but having ramifications beyond the plays themselves. In the first sequence, Beverley appeared to elbow Smith in the mouth, causing Smith to lose part of a tooth. Smith left the game briefly for medical attention, only after winning the jump ball. And he appeared postgame with the tooth appearing intact, calling it ""magic."" Then the two wrestled on the floor for another loose ball in the fourth quarter, and after Beverley got up holding the ball, he threw the ball into the stands, earning a technical foul and an ejection. He said after the game that a fan uttered an expletive about his mother. ""Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a family first guy and some things are just unacceptable,"" Beverley said. ""If no one is going to control fans, what are we supposed to do as players? I'm a grown man, but when you bring family into it, especially in a basketball game, there's only so much you can tolerate as a man."" TIP-INS Clippers: Coach Doc Rivers on Beverley's technical: ""I told him it's the life we live and you got to turn the other cheek even though I know it's hard, but we can't get technicals. We just have to walk away and then the league has to take care of stuff like that."" ... The Clippers lost for just the second time in 11 games. Mavericks: In addition to Doncic, reserve forward Maxi Kleber sat out with right knee soreness. Coach Rick Carlisle doesn't believe either injury is serious. ... Barnes' 30 points were a season-high, and J.J. Barea had 20 of his season-high 24 points in the first half. Barea left in the final minute with a bloody nose after an inadvertent elbow from Avery Bradley, but was fine after the game.","401071022"
"SAN ANTONIO --  A day off was the exhale the San Antonio Spurs needed after two blowout losses. DeMar DeRozan had a season-high 36 points and San Antonio overcame a big game by Damian Lillard to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 131-118 on Sunday night. The Spurs held a rare practice Saturday morning following consecutive losses of 39 points and 31 points. The team responded with its highest scoring output in regulation this season. ""Our communication was better,"" DeRozan said. ""I just told the guys, go out there and play, relax, don't think too much."" The Spurs responded by shooting 70 percent on 3-pointers with at least 10 attempts for the first time since 2006, finishing 11 for 15 on 3s. LaMarcus Aldridge added 29 points and Rudy Gay had 18 as San Antonio snapped its two-game skid. Lillard scored 37 points and C.J. McCollum had 24 for Portland. The Blazers have lost five of six, giving up an average of 123.2 points in those losses. ""We've given up a lot of points, but the league's funny right now,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""San Antonio just came off of games where they've given up a lot of points."" Spurs guard Patty Mills referred to the losses as ""embarrassing"" and ""deflating,"" but San Antonio was able to rebound with a needed win as it prepares to embark on a two-game road trip. ""It had to be better than the last two games, right?"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Everybody's got to participate. Good individual defense matters and good team defense (matters), but there is no team defense without talking or trust. We're trying to get there with this new group."" DeRozan scored 26 points in the second half as the Spurs rallied from a seven-point deficit in the third quarter after blowing a 12-point lead in the first half. Portland opened the second half on a 24-10 run in taking a 79-72 lead. San Antonio aided the spurt by committing four turnovers and missing five of its first six shots. ""We were trying to get L.A. going, get him in a rhythm,"" DeRozan said. ""As soon as he came out in the third quarter, I seen we were just kind of stagnant. We had a couple of turnovers in a row, I just tried to be more aggressive and put the pressure on them."" Al-Farouq Aminu tied a season high, scoring 11 of his 20 points in the third quarter. Aminu also finished with nine rebounds. DeRozan had 18 of San Antonio's final 20 points to close the third quarter, giving the Spurs a 97-90 lead entering the fourth. He opened the game 3 for 12 but finished 13 of 27 in scoring the most points he has with San Antonio. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! Popovich praised coach Jeff Van Gundy for leading the United States men's basketball team to a berth in the 2019 World Cup in China with a 78-70 victory over Uruguay on Sunday. Popovich will coach the U.S. squad in the World Cup in August 2019 and in the 2020 Olympics. ""Well, of course I'm happy as heck,"" Popovich said. ""We're not in the dance if we don't qualify. Coach Van Gundy has been brilliant and he's working for pennies, zero pennies. He wants to do it for the country and he loves coaching. There's nobody better to put a team together quickly. I think this was the fifth time, I'm not sure, but four or five different teams to get the USA to be able to qualify. He deserves a lot of credit and all those guys that have given up their time to do this. It was a group effort, but he's the guy that made it go."" WHISTLE STOP The Spurs noticed Stotts kept whistling when he wanted the Blazers to double team defensively. ""I just noticed it,"" Aldridge said. ""I think last year and this year whenever he whistles, the double is coming. And I think he does it sometimes to try to trick you into thinking it's coming. But I thought everyone was ready for it. I thought guys went to the right spaces. I tried to make the right reads and it ended up working out."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Every starter scored in double figures except Maurice Harkless, who finished with eight points on 3-for-5 shooting. ... Aminu also scored 20 points against Denver on Nov. 30. ... Evan Turner sat out with an inflamed left Achilles tendon. Turner had played in every game, averaging 8.2 points in 26 minutes.

"DETROIT --  Detroit hadn't lost in 12 days. Oklahoma City has been on a tear since the end of October. On Monday night, it was the Thunder who stayed hot.

""There were things we could have done better, but I'm pleased that we went on the road and played this well against a very good team."" Paul George added 17 points for the Thunder, who are 15-3 since losing their first four games. Detroit had won the first five games of a six-game homestand, including a victory over the Golden State Warriors on Saturday, but the Thunder held the Pistons to a season low in points.

I didn't have us ready to play against one of the top defensive teams in the league."" Blake Griffin led Detroit with 20 points, while Andre Drummond added 13. The 33 points was 10.5 below their combined season average, and they combined for 11 rebounds after coming in with an average of 25.9. ""We didn't come out with any urgency, and that's entirely on us,"" Griffin said. ""No coach can go out there and make us play hard. We need to take a hard look at this game and learn from what we did out there."" The Thunder double-teamed Griffin, and while he finished with four assists, he couldn't create easy baskets for his teammates. ""It is always tough to double Blake because he's such a good passer,"" Donovan said. ""Tonight, though, we were making him send the ball back to the perimeter. I think he hit Andre for one layup, but that was about it."" The Thunder led 50-40 at halftime behind 14 points from Adams and 10 from Jeremi Grant. Griffin had 15 points for Detroit, which shot 34.7 percent from the floor. ""We were doubling Blake, but we did a great job of rotating and recovering off the double-team,"" Adams said. ""We were playing good defense and we were making shots. That's good stuff."" Detroit's offense continued to struggle in the second half without Reggie Bullock, who left the game in the first quarter with an ankle injury. The Thunder took a 71-51 lead midway through the third quarter and led by 28 at the end of the period. In the fourth, Oklahoma City led by as many as 35. ""We've got to play with more intensity than that,"" said Reggie Jackson, who finished with 10 points against his former team. ""We weren't good enough tonight."" Adams made his first seven field-goal attempts, along with five free throws, and forced Drummond and Zaza Pachulia to the bench with four fouls each. The Pistons finished the third quarter with Griffin at center and 6-foot-7 Stanley Johnson at power forward. ""I thought Steven and Russell did a great job in the pick-and-roll,"" Donovan said. ""Steven was able to create pressure at the rim all night, and even when the Pistons adjusted their coverage, he and Russell adjusted at the next stoppage of the play."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City is 15-5 against the Pistons since leaving Seattle. ... The Thunder, who came into the game with the league's best defensive rating, are now 4-0 when holding their opponents under 90 points. Pistons: Detroit fell short of its first seven-game home winning streak since March 14-April 4, 2008. ... Drummond went 1-for-2 from the free-throw line and has now missed 19 of his last 24 attempts. TOUGH CROWD The 5-0 homestand didn't prevent the Pistons from getting booed in the second half. ""I've been in this league for a long time, and you are only as good as your last game,"" Griffin said. ""That's normal these days. It isn't just this fan base.""","401071024"
"ATLANTA --  Golden State's Big Three went for balance. Stephen Curry scored 30 points, Kevin Durant had 28 and Klay Thompson chipped in with 27 as the Warriors cruised past the Atlanta Hawks 128-111 Monday night, snapping a six-game losing streak on the road. All three stars have scored more than 50 points in a game this season. This time, they spread the wealth . ""Our defense set the tone,"" Curry said. ""Everybody gets to touch the ball."" With Curry scoring 18 points in the opening quarter, this one was never in doubt. Golden State raced to a 34-17 lead in the first 12 minutes -- Curry outscored the Hawks by himself -- and the defending NBA champions won for only the fourth time in 10 games. Playing for the second time since missing 11 games with a groin injury, Curry hit his first six shots, four of them beyond the arc . He finished 6 of 10 from 3-point range ""I think he's now back in the groove,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He looked great handling the ball."" The Warriors led 61-47 at halftime and stretched the margin as high as 24 points, sending the rebuilding Hawks to their third straight loss. ""We needed a win on the road,"" Curry said. ""We kind of didn't want to give them life."" Despite the win, Kerr said he's not pleased with his team's performance. ""We're not where we need to be by any stretch of the imagination,"" Kerr said. ""We've been kind of uneven to this point."" John Collins led Atlanta with 24 points , and Trae Young added 20. But it was a tough night for Young, the rookie guard who the Hawks are hoping to turn into their Curry-like centerpiece. He had seven turnovers and missed all five of his 3-point attempts. ""I really don't listen to or care about the comparisons,"" Young said. ""All I'm thinking about are my teammates and putting them in the best position to win."" The youngster is struggling with his shot, especially from long range. He's only connecting on 23.9 percent of his 3-pointers. ""They're picking me up full court,"" Young said. ""They're not going to just sag off and let me have open 3s. I've got to find a way to knock them down. I will."" INJURY REPORT Hawks forward Taurean Prince could be out for an extended period after spraining his left ankle when he came down on Shaun Livingston while shooting. Prince hobbled to the locker room in the fourth quarter. Afterward, he headed for home on crutches. ""The X-rays were negative,"" Prince said. ""We'll have an MRI tomorrow."" For Golden State, Draymond Green missed his ninth straight game with a sprained toe on his right foot. He's expected to miss at least the last two games of a five-game road trip, which ties the longest of the season. TIP-INS Warriors: Improved to 31-3 when Curry, Thompson and Durant all reach 20 points. ... Golden State has won nine in a row over the Hawks, including four straight in Atlanta. ... Thompson has scored at least 20 points in nine straight games, the longest streak of his career. ... Kevon Looney scored a season-high 14 points . ... Quinn Cook picked up five fouls in only 11 minutes. Hawks: Jeremy Lin returned after missing two games with a sprained left ankle, scoring  14 points and converting a couple of three-point plays after drawing fouls on drives to the basket ... DeAndre' Bembry didn't have much luck trying to guard Durant, picking up four fouls. ... Atlanta had 18 turnovers and went 5 of 26 from outside the 3-point stripe. ""We've got to value the ball a little bit better than we have,"" coach Lloyd Pierce said. CURRY'S FOULS The Warriors star went to the bench after picking up his third foul with 2 1/2 minutes left in the first half. Kerr strolled over near center court, where Vince Carter was checking into the game for Atlanta. ""A lot of people paid good money to see him play,"" Kerr said, referring to Curry. Carter smiled. Curry picked up only one foul the rest of the way, playing a little over 29 minutes. ROOKIE OF THE MONTH Young was named Eastern Conference rookie of the month for October and November after averaging 15.6 points and 7.6 assists in the first month and a half of the season. Despite the accolades, he isn't satisfied with his performance. ""Personally, I haven't played the way I wanted to,"" he said. ""I know I haven't.""","401071025"
"NEW YORK --  Alec Burks had a more productive visit to Barclays Center than his last one. Playing just his third game for Cleveland after a trade from Utah, Burks threw down a two-handed dunk with 3.2 seconds remaining, and the Cavaliers avoided a fourth-quarter collapse and edged the Brooklyn Nets 99-97 on Monday night. Burks was traded last Wednesday for veteran Kyle Korver and two future second-round picks. He was notified about the deal at Barclays Center and had to pack his bags hours before tip-off. ""It's crazy. Maybe I'll look back at it after this whole thing is over with,"" Burks said. The eight-year veteran has quickly earned the trust of Cavaliers coach Larry Drew. He had 13 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench. ""It feels great. (Drew) trusts my talent, my abilities and my teammates trust me,"" Burks said. Jordan Clarkson had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Tristan Thompson had 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who snapped a four-game skid. Cleveland led by 91-80 with 6:03 left in the fourth period after Rodney Hood hit an 18-foot jumper. The Nets then went on a 17-6 run, tying it 97-all on rookie Rodion Kurucs' put-back layup with 18.9 seconds left. Burks then got an assist from his old Utah teammate, Rodney Hood, who set a screen and drew the attention of Allen Crabbe on the defensive switch. Burks drove past Spencer Dinwiddie, who had five fouls, for the dunk that sealed it for Cleveland. The Cavaliers had been winless since beating Philadelphia and Houston back-to-back on Nov. 23-24. ""He just made a fantastic, athletic play,"" Drew said. ""It was a clear-out for him and he just made a terrific move, got to the basket. I drew up the play but he made it happen."" Dinwiddie's potential game-winning 3-pointer fell short of the rim. D'Angelo Russell scored 28 points for Brooklyn, which has lost seven straight and nine of 11 overall, including their last six at home. Dinwiddie had 18 points off the bench. ""I mean, if you go back and look at it from game to game, at the end of the day it's a loss,"" Russell said. ""So, definitely looking for ways to improve, bringing those tactics to the next game but, at the end of the day it's still a loss on our side."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Burks is averaging 13.3 points in his three games with Cleveland. Nets: G Joe Harris missed his third straight game with a strained left hip. ... Russell scored 20 points or more for the 11th time this season. That's the most by a Nets guard in the team's first 25 games since Deron Williams' 12 such games in 2011-12.

"NEW YORK --  Bradley Beal felt at home at Madison Square Garden, and for good reason given the Wizards' recent history there. Beal finished with 27 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 21 off the bench as Washington beat the Knicks in New York for the ninth straight time, 110-107 on Monday night. ""I feel like every time I step into this building, I need to have a great game,"" Beal said. ""That is how I approach it. It is a true basketball building. There is legacy and history here. It's a big stage with lots of lights."" John Wall had 18 points and 15 assists for the Wizards, who won on the road for just the third time this season. Markieff Morris also had 18 points and Otto Porter Jr. added 15. ""I don't know what else to say other than we won nine (straight) games,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We just gotta keep playing every game like we did tonight in that third and fourth quarter, and hopefully there's a tenth one."" Tim Hardaway Jr. led the Knicks with 20 points. Damyean Dotson scored 17 and Enes Kanter had 13 points and 16 rebounds for New York, which has lost three of four. Washington trailed by as many as 11 points late in the second quarter, but Beal's layup with 6.6 seconds remaining got the Wizards within 61-52 at halftime. Washington then opened the third quarter with a 28-8 run and went ahead 80-69 on Wall's dunk with 3:33 left in the period. ""We didn't come out ready,"" Kanter said. ""They had more energy and we just couldn't respond."" The Knicks closed the gap to 86-80 at the end of the quarter and pulled within 88-84 early in the fourth. However, the Wizards scored the next seven points and went on to lead by a game-high 16, 105-89, on Wall's jumper with 4:24 to play. New York mounted a frantic rally and pulled within three, 107-104, on Noah Vonleh's layup with 35 seconds left. But Wall hit a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left before Courtney Lee ended the scoring with a 3-pointer with less than a second remaining. ""That's us. That's our team,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""As long as there's time on the clock our guys will fight to try to win the game."" Emmanuel Mudiay had 16 points for the Knicks, and Vonleh had 11. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington hasn't lost to the Knicks in New York since April 9, 2013. Overall, the Wizards have won the last 10 meetings between the teams. Knicks: Trey Burke did not play because of a sprained right knee. ... Lee, who suffered a neck injury in September, appeared in his first game this season. He played 16 minutes and scored seven points. ... Frank Ntilikina did not see action for a second straight game (coach's decision) after playing in each of the Knicks' first 23 games. NEXT MAN UP No Knick has started all 25 games this season, but Kanter, Allonzo Trier and Vonleh have played in each. The Wizards' starting backcourt of Beal and Wall has been intact for every game, and they are the only Washington players to see action in all 24 games. NO FREEBIES NECESSARY The Wizards took control in the third quarter, when they outscored the Knicks 34-19 without the benefit of a single free throw. They shot 60 percent (15 for 25) from the field, including 44.4 percent (4 of 9) from 3-point range, over those 12 minutes.","401071027"
"TORONTO --  Nikola Jokic got his second triple-double of the season to help the injury-riddled Denver Nuggets overcome another key absence. Jokic capped a big night with three free throws in the final seven seconds, Kyle Lowry missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer and the Nuggets survived the loss of leading scorer Gary Harris to beat the Toronto Raptors 106-103 on Monday night. ""To beat the number one team in the East means a lot to us,"" Jokic said. Jokic made it 104-103 with a free throw with 7.0 seconds left, then hit two more foul shots with 5.6 seconds remaining before Lowry bounced a 26-footer off the rim. Jokic had 23 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds, Jamal Murray scored 21 points, and Malik Beasley and Juan Hernangomez each scored 15 points for Denver. The Nuggets won their sixth straight and halted Toronto's winning streak at eight. ""He does everything,"" Murray said of Jokic. ""He passes, rebounds, handles the ball. There's nothing he really can't do, except jump."" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said he doesn't see much missing from Jokic's toolbox. ""I was kind of hoping we'd be able to disrupt him with a little bit more pressure,"" Nurse said. ""He just seemed to handle it. We worked hard on him, we tried to put him under some duress with the ball but it just didn't faze him."" Kawhi Leonard scored 27 points, Serge Ibaka had 15 and Pascal Siakam 14 for the Raptors. Harris scored three points in the opening quarter but did not play after the first because of a sore right hip. He came in averaging a team-high 17.3 points per game. Harris is expected to undergo an MRI on Tuesday before the Nuggets leave Toronto for Orlando, where they play Wednesday. ""Hopefully we can get him back really soon,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""Gary is such a big part of what we're trying to do, big loss."" Lowry returned after sitting out Saturday's loss at Cleveland because of an unspecified back injury, the first game he'd missed this season. He shot 1 for 7, missing 5 of 6 from 3-point range. Lowry left without speaking to reporters. Leonard was also unavailable because he was working out. Toronto shot 11 for 41 from outside the arc. ""They wanted to win more than we did,"" Siakam said. ""We didn't bring the energy we usually have."" The game pitted Leonard, the Eastern Conference player of the week, against Denver's Paul Millsap, the Western Conference award winner. ""A win is a win, it doesn't matter who it's against, but it does mean a little bit more to win against a top team like the Raptors,"" Millsap said. The Nuggets led 86-78 to begin the fourth, but Toronto tied it at 94 on Ibaka's dunk at 4:41. Ibaka made a pair of free throws and Leonard drained a jump shot with 54 seconds left to put Toronto up 101-100, its first lead of the second half. Jokic restored Denver's lead with 40 seconds remaining before Danny Green missed twice at the other end. Hernangomez was fouled grabbing the rebound on Green's second miss and made one of two from the free-throw line, but Leonard answered with a jumper, tying it 103-all with seven seconds left. TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic had seven assists in the first. His career high is 17, set Feb 15, 2018 at Milwaukee. ... Jokic has 18 career triple-doubles. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns and the Timberwolves got together in the locker room at halftime to address what needed to be fixed -- all their defensive lapses that led to a big second quarter by the Rockets. Minnesota clamped down after that, and Houston had hardly any offense at all. A stingy defensive effort by Minnesota helped erase a 14-point halftime deficit, and the Timberwolves beat the Rockets 103-91 on Monday night. Minnesota shut things down after the break, holding the Rockets to 29 points in the second half. ""We came in here and we made it clear we've got to change things and we've got to be the team that wants it more,"" Towns said of the halftime discussion. ""I think everyone in the building saw that we came out with an edge to us and a fire to us to get back in the game."" Towns led Minnesota with 24 points and 11 rebounds, and Andrew Wiggins had 16 points. The Rockets led by as many as 19 in the first half before Minnesota stormed back to take the lead for good in the third quarter. James Harden finished with 29 points, and Clint Capela added 24 for the Rockets. Houston went cold after halftime, scoring just nine points in the fourth quarter. ""In the second half, we just laid an egg,"" Rockets guard Eric Gordon said. ""They had everything going. You could tell by their confidence. They just played better defensively."" Following the example set Robert Covington, Minnesota stepped up its defensive intensity in the third quarter while shooting 7 of 10 from 3-point range. Houston shot just 38.1 percent in the third quarter and connected on 2 of 11 from deep. Covington, acquired by Minnesota last month in a trade that sent Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia, has helped jumpstart the Wolves' defense since his arrival. Since the All-Defensive First Team selection made his Timberwolves debut, Minnesota has held opponents to 100 points or fewer in seven of 10 games. ""It just shows how good we can be defensively,"" said Covington, who had two blocks, two steals and 13 points. ""Everyone that stepped on the court was really engaged in the second half defensively, and that's what allowed us to hold them to that."" Harden scored 14 of Houston's 38 points in the second quarter as the Rockets pushed their lead to 14 at the half. Minnesota had three technical fouls in the first half. Towns received a technical after he thought he was fouled, and Covington got one late in the second quarter. Jeff Teague was hit with a technical foul on a play in which he was fouled. After Houston scored 38 points in the second quarter, Minnesota answered with a 38-point quarter of its own. The Timberwolves tied it at 76 after back-to-back 3-pointers by Teague to cap a 15-3 run. Wiggins also hit a 3-pointer and had a block at the other end during the stretch. Minnesota took its first lead since 14-11 when Dario Saric hit a 3-pointer that made it 79-77. The Wolves grew their lead in the fourth quarter on a three-point play by Saric and a 3-pointer from the top of the key by Covington that made it 94-82. Harden hit a shot in the fourth that ended a 42-14 Timberwolves' run over 14 1/2 minutes. The nine points in the fourth quarter was the fewest for the Rockets in any quarter this season. ""For whatever reason, the second half we played without any kind of spirit or energy,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Things were going great in the first half, and then at the end of the first half we let them come back."" Monday marked the first time Minnesota and Houston faced off since last year's playoffs. The Rockets beat the Timberwolves in five games, including a game that saw Houston score 50 points in a quarter at Target Center.

"NEW ORLEANS --  As comfortable as Lou Williams is going to his left, so are the Los Angeles Clippers in the clutch. Even on the road, after blowing an 18-point lead. Tobias Harris made two free throws with 4.7 seconds left to close out a 27-point performance, and the Clippers held off the New Orleans Pelicans 129-126 on Monday night. ""We've had a bunch of close games,"" said Williams, whose 20-point night was highlighted by his contested, off-balance jumper as he dribbled left, giving the Clippers a 127-124 lead with 6.4 seconds remaining. ""If you're going to compete in the Western Conference -- there's a lot of talented teams -- you're going to have to be able to do that,"" Williams continued. ""So, I think that was good for us."" After Williams' pivotal shot, the Clippers chose to foul quickly on New Orleans' next possession. Darius Miller made two free throws with 4.9 seconds to go and the Pelicans followed suit with a quick foul, but had to attempt a 3 as time ran out after Harris made his late free throws. E'Twaun Moore wound up with the final shot, which caromed off the rim for a long rebound as time expired. Danilo Gallinari scored 24 points for the Clippers, who scored 77 points in the first half, when they shot 65.2 percent (30 of 46) and took a 12-point lead into the locker room. ""We missed defensive assignments. There were a couple of times where we were not aggressive enough, especially on guys that can really score,"" Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday said. ""We really didn't make it hard on them."" Julius Randle scored a career-high 37 points for New Orleans, but fouled out with New Orleans leading by four with about four minutes left. ""When you are playing aggressive, trying to make things happen, it goes like that sometimes,"" Randle said. ""I've just got to be better, smarter in those situations."" Holiday had season highs of 32 points and 14 assists, but he missed a 3 that could have given New Orleans the lead with 33 seconds left.

New Orleans stormed back with a 21-4 run late in the third quarter that included back-to-back 3s by Randle and Holiday. Miller's 3 with 5:23 remaining gave the Pelicans their first lead since the first quarter, and New Orleans briefly led by four after Davis laid in Holiday's alley-oop lob. The crowd was energized, sensing an improbable comeback, only to see the Clippers regain control. The Clippers scored the next six points on Gallinari's free throws, Harris' driving floater and Harrell's layup after Williams found him cutting down the lane between converging defenders. ""We did a good job just weathering the storm,"" Williams said, nodding toward the Pelicans' locker room. ""You've got to give those guys credit. It's a talented group in there."" There were two more ties after that, but the Clippers took the lead for good on Williams' free throws with 1:32 left. QUOTABLE ""One dribble left -- it's bread and butter,"" Williams said of his final shot, with his foot on the 3-point line, as he went to his left near the left sideline. Asked if he felt off-balance when he let it fly, he smiled and said, ""I'm always off-balance."" Holiday, who was guarding Williams, said, ""That's what he does, and at that point, you've just got to hope he misses. But most of the time, going to his left, he's probably going to make it.""","401071030"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers aren't picky or worried about style points. With All-Star guard Victor Oladipo out for an eighth straight game with a sore right knee, the Pacers will take wins, no matter how they come. Myles Turner matched his season high with 18 points and added 11 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Pacers defeated Chicago 96-90 on Tuesday night and spoiled the debut of new Bulls coach Jim Boylen. ""It was a pretty murky, muddy kind of game,"" Turner said. ""It wasn't a pretty win, but wins are hard to come by in this league and we got it done."" Darren Collison had 23 points and eight rebounds, Bojan Bogdanovic scored 14 points and Tyreke Evans finished with 10 for Indiana. Lauri Markkanen led the Bulls with 21 points and 10 rebounds. Justin Holiday, facing off against his brother, Indiana rookie Aaron Holiday, finished with 15 points. Chicago has lost seven straight games. With the absence of Oladipo hard to ignore, the Pacers relied heavily on their five starters to carry the load. Four of Indiana's five starters scored in double figures, combining for 71 of the Pacers' 96 points. ""The fact that we're able to hold down the fort without (Oladipo) is big,"" Turner said. ""We have a lot of guys who can go out there and make plays. There's a lot of depth on this team and it's good to not have to rely on one person."" One of Indiana's biggest contributions came from Domantis Sabonis off the bench, and could very well have been the difference, with Pacers' starters working overtime to fill the void left by Oladipo's nagging injury. Sabonis added nine points and 11 rebounds off the bench. The teams got off to a sluggish start. Indiana held the slight advantage early, jumping ahead by as many as nine points during the first half. But the Pacers trailed the Bulls 45-43 at halftime despite the early lead and Chicago shooting just 40 percent from the floor over the first two quarters. The Pacers closed out the third quarter on a 9-4 run for a 70-67 lead. Chicago never recovered from the deficit, although the Bulls stayed within single digits during the final 12 minutes. The Bulls weren't able to get any closer than three points during the final 1:45. While Indiana faces life without its star player, the Bulls embarked on their first game with a new face at the helm. Boylen was named Bulls coach on Monday, taking over for the fired Fred Hoiberg, who was let go following a 5-19 start this season. Hoiberg had a 115-155 mark with one playoff appearance in three-plus seasons. ""I really like this team. I really like these guys,"" Boylen said. ""I thought we battled. I'm proud of this group.""

Gordon had 16 of his points in the third as Orlando outscored Miami 30-12, the Magic turning what was a four-point halftime deficit into a 14-point lead. Most Miami fans started heading to the exits with a few minutes left, and Heat center Hassan Whiteside left for the locker room with 40.5 seconds remaining. ""Probably extremely upset, like we all are right now,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, after his team dropped to 9-14. Whiteside wasn't available for comment after the game. A team official said Whiteside went upstairs to the team's practice court after the game to shoot free throws after going 0 for 2 on Tuesday -- dropping him to a staggering 4 for his last 28 from the foul line over the last six-plus games, a 14.3 percent clip. His free throws aren't why Miami lost Tuesday, but merely just one of many things going wrong for the Heat right now. ""I thought our offense just stunk tonight,"" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. Miami had won two straight, but Wade said the same approach that the Heat had in those victories over New Orleans and Utah wasn't there against Orlando. ""It didn't feel like a game,"" Wade said. ""It didn't feel like the last two games felt, when we needed wins because we were struggling. After winning two, I felt like we relaxed for some reason, like we've got enough wins around here. We've got to go. It's go time, man. You don't want to get too far behind."" Terrence Ross added 19 off the bench for the Magic, who were 14 for 28 from 3-point range. Evan Fournier scored 13 and DJ Augustin had 11 for Orlando. ""We just picked it up on the defensive end,"" Gordon said. ""Stops on the defensive end, playing the whole court and being aggressive."" Justise Winslow scored 14 for Miami, which still hasn't had a three-game winning streak this season. Kelly Olynyk scored 13, Whiteside had 12 and Wade and James Johnson each added 11 for the Heat. Miami was only 2 for 5 from the foul line in the game, as opposed to Orlando's 15 for 20. The two free throws made in a game tied a record-low in Heat history, and the five attempted ties for the second-lowest. Lulls have doomed Miami all season, and a third-quarter one was the difference. The Magic were 1-10 this season in games in which they weren't winning at halftime, but outscored the Heat 30-12 in the third quarter to grab control. It was Miami's lowest-scoring quarter of the season -- one point less than its opening quarter against Brooklyn on Nov. 20 -- and the worst quarter the Heat had against Orlando since an 11-point third on Feb. 8, 2012. ""It's our inability to sustain,"" Spoelstra said. ""That's it. ... There's a flagrant inconsistency that we keep bumping into."" Orlando held the Heat to 24 percent shooting in the third (5-21) and the Magic didn't commit a turnover in the period. ""Obviously Aaron Gordon was tremendous in the third quarter, both his offense and the defense,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Our defense was better and they missed some open shots also."" TIP-INS Magic: Orlando is 2-0 against the Heat this season and 7-2 in the last nine meetings. ... The Magic have posted three quarters with a score differential of plus-18 or better this season -- and all have been on the road, against New York (20), Golden State (18) and Miami (18). Heat: Tyler Johnson returned after missing six games with a hamstring strain. Goran Dragic (knee), Derrick Jones Jr. (hamstring) and Dion Waiters (ankle rehab) remained sidelined. ... It was Miami's last home game until Dec. 20. SOUTHEAST WOES Orlando is now atop the Southeast Division at 12-12. The five teams in Southeast are a combined 47-71 this season. MO' WADE BLOCKS Wade added another 7-footer to his blocked-shot collection, when he rejected Orlando rookie Mo Bamba at the rim in the fourth quarter. No player who stands 6-foot-4 or less has more blocks in their career than Wade.","401071032"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks hadn't won eight in a row at home since the year they won the NBA championship. On Tuesday night, they matched that mark and continued their upward trajectory in the rugged Western Conference. Luka Doncic scored 21 points and Wesley Matthews added 17 as the Mavericks won for the ninth time in 11 games, beating the Portland Trail Blazers 111-102. DeAndre Jordan added 12 points and 17 rebounds for Dallas, which won its eighth in a row at American Airlines Center for the first time since March 2011 -- three months before they defeated Miami for the franchise's only NBA title. ""To be the team we want to be, we have to win the games at home,"" Matthews said. ""Our attention to defense is what's really doing it for us."" That defense made it difficult for Portland's vaunted backcourt. Damian Lillard had 33 points, but shot 10 for 23 from the field and 2 for 8 on 3s. His 11-for-12 shooting from the line helped his total. C.J. McCollum added 18 points for the Blazers, but made just 7 of 19 shots and 2 of 7 3s. ""Our guys did a great job executing the defensive game plan,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Which was not an easy game plan because we were chasing guys who are great players 30 to 40 feet away from the basket."" Lillard scored 25 of his 33 points in the second half as Portland tried, but failed, to rally from a deficit that was mostly double digits through almost all the first three quarters. ""It's an uphill battle,"" Lillard said. ""I thought we still had a chance. When you create a hole, you got to fight out of it so hard to get there, you put yourself in a position where you got to be perfect down the stretch."" The Mavericks closed out the first quarter with a 17-3 run and held a double-digit lead until Lillard's drive and free throw made it 78-69 late in the third. Dwight Powell hit consecutive 3-pointers and Maxi Kleber followed a Devin Harris miss with a dunk to put Dallas up by 14 after three quarters. J.J. Barea's driving layup capped a 10-0 run that gave the Mavericks their biggest lead at 92-73. Portland got as close as six points in the game's final minutes, but Doncic hit a fall-away 3-pointer with 58.9 seconds to go for a 108-99 lead. HITTING THE SKIDS The teams are going in opposite directions. While Dallas has heated up, Portland has lost eight of its last 11. ""This game was very similar to the last two we played,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Get off to a slow start, get down at halftime, make a good comeback and fall short. I think we're all getting tired of it."" TIP INS Trail Blazers: Lillard scored the Blazers' final 15 points of the third quarter. . Portland's frustration became evident in the third quarter when Al-Farouq Aminu and Maurice Harkless were given technical fouls 35 seconds apart for arguing with referee Ed Malloy. Mavericks: Guard Dennis Smith Jr. had 12 points and nine assists, one day after he had a root canal to fix a broken tooth suffered Sunday night after the Clippers' Patrick Beverley caught him with an elbow. ... Every Dallas starter scored in double figures and every Mavs player who saw action scored at least five. DONCIC HONORED Doncic was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for October/November. Doncic started the team's first 20 games and averaged a team-high 18.5 points. He's second on the team in rebounds and assists. ""It means a lot,"" Doncic said. ""It's just another example for me to keep working hard and keep fighting for what I want. There's a lot to improve."" The last Dallas player to be selected Rookie of the Month -- and the only one since 2004 -- was Yogi Ferrell in February 2017.","401071033"
"PHOENIX --  The Sacramento Kings couldn't have asked for an easier lead-in to a three-game Eastern swing. Buddy Hield scored 20 points in 18 minutes and the Kings buried the Suns early on Tuesday night, outscoring Phoenix 36-9 in the first quarter as they cruised to a 122-105 victory. De'Aaron Fox had 16 points and seven assists. Seven players scored in double figures for Sacramento, including Bogdan Bogdanovic off the bench with 14 points, and no starter played more than 27 minutes. Sacramento has won two straight after losing its previous three. ""I just found the right spots, right time and my teammates were able to hit me,"" Hield said. ""Everybody did a great job of spreading the ball around."" Rookie De'Anthony Melton led Phoenix with a career-high 21 points. Trevor Ariza and Josh Jackson scored 14 each for the Suns, who have lost six straight and nine of 10. Playing without leading scorer Devin Booker, who has missed two of the last three games, and forward TJ Warren, out for the third straight game with right ankle soreness, the Suns couldn't overcome 3-for-17 shooting in the first 12 minutes. ""We lost the game in the first quarter, then from there it was just competing to show we had character, which we did in the second half,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""No excuses, the effort wasn't there."" The Suns missed their first 12 3-point attempts. Sacramento center Willie Cauley-Stein had four steals in the game's first four minutes. ""It was just the focus and the desire defensively to get after them,"" Kimgs coach Dave Joerger said. ""It was kind of our night and a lot of shots went down for us and we got off to a quick start, and that helped."" The Kings ended the period on Bogdanovic's layup with 1.4 seconds remaining. That brought boos from the crowd as the Suns set a season low for scoring in a quarter. Fans cheered derisively when the Suns reached double figures at the 9:37 mark of the second period. Hield's third 3 of the first half gave the Kings a 46-13 lead at the eight-minute mark. Melton made the Suns' first 3-pointer of the night with 6:20 left in the second quarter, and when Ariza flew in for a fast-break dunk with 4:42 to go in the half, the score was 53-24. The Kings took a 68-40 lead into halftime, with Hield's 18 points leading the way. ""It is really hard to play a game where we don't make shots. There are going to be times like that,"" Jackson said. ""It's basketball, but the times we don't make shots we have to make sure we play good defense and not let the other team score."" Phoenix got as close as 22 points in the third quarter, 81-59, but the Kings responded with a 13-2 run and took a 99-67 lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Kings: Four of Tuesday's starters have started all 23 games this season. The exception was Iman Shumpert, who has started 18 of 20 games. ... Bogdanovic walked over to slap hands with Kokoskov during a stoppage in play in the first quarter. Both are from Serbia. ... At 12-11, this is the deepest into a season the Kings have been above .500 since the end of the 2005-2006 campaign. Suns: Booker was unable to play after injuring his hamstring Sunday against the Los Angeles Lakers. ... For the second time this season, the Suns started three rookies in Deandre Ayton, Elie Okobo and Mikal Bridges. ... G Troy Daniels scored a season-high 13 points off the bench. BAGLEY RULED OUT A possible matchup between the top two picks in this year's draft fizzled when Marvin Bagley III, chosen second overall by the Kings after Ayton was taken by the Suns, was ruled out for the second straight game with back spasms. Joerger noted that NBA teams often play more games before Christmas than a college team plays in the entire season. ""It's a grind and he loves to play, so you love that part about him and he wants to be out there,"" Joerger said of Bagley, who is from nearby Tempe. ""He'll get back out there as soon as he is physically confident and so is our staff."" BAHAMA BALLERS Ayton and Hield were born in The Bahamas, making Tuesday's game the first in NBA history to feature two players from the island nation. They are the fourth and fifth players from their country in NBA history, and five media members from The Bahamas were credentialed to cover the game.","401071034"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Kyle Korver is back, and suddenly the Utah Jazz are sinking shots. ""His confidence is contagious,"" Donovan Mitchell said. ""His presence just gives us spacing and helps everybody."" Mitchell scored 20 points, Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and the Utah Jazz beat the San Antonio Spurs 139-105 on Tuesday night. Korver scored 15 points in his first home game since he returned to the Jazz, and Derrick Favors added 14 points as Utah won for the first time at home in nearly a month. The Jazz beat Boston 123-115 on Nov. 9 but have been on the road much of the season and haven't found a rhythm at home. ""He gets his shot off in a half a second. It helps us to have another guy who can really space the floor and knock them down,"" said Joe Ingles, who had 13 points. Jakob Poeltl scored a career-high 20 points for the Spurs. DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge each scored 16 points, and San Antonio fell to 1-13 when Aldridge fails to reach the 20-point mark. ""It doesn't really matter,"" Poeltl said. ""If I get a career high in a 30-point loss or whatever, it doesn't feel great. We're just not aggressive enough. We're very passive."" The Spurs lost by more than 30 points just five times in Gregg Popovich's first 1,758 regular-season games as head coach. It has now happened three times in the last four games. ""We're very challenged defensively,"" Popovich said. The Spurs cut their deficit to 67-53 early in the third quarter, but less than three minutes later, Mitchell and Ingles hit back-to-back 3-pointers and the Jazz moved out to an 84-59 advantage. The Jazz haven't been cashing in on their 3-point chances this season until recently. Utah traded Alec Burks and two second-round draft picks to Cleveland for Korver, who made his first home appearance to a loud ovation. Korver, who played for the Jazz from 2007-10, shot 3 of 4 from beyond the arc and scored 15 points in 15 minutes. ""It was a great first night back. I have a lot of good memories of this place,"" Korver said. ""We played really good basketball. The ball was moving. We were playing for each other."" Utah had season bests in shooting from inside (60.7 percent) and outside the arc (60.6 percent) as they scored 139 points for the first time this season. The Jazz improved to 3-6 at home. No team has played as many road games as the Jazz, who have gone 9-7 away from Salt Lake City. RUDY IS JUST FINE The NBA fined Gobert $15,000 for publicly criticizing the officiating after his team's 102-100 loss to the Heat on Sunday in Miami. Gobert fouled Heat guard Dwyane Wade with 3.2 seconds left in the game, and the guard's two free throws gave Miami the win. ""I just want it to be consistent at one point. ... If you call something one way, you have to call it the other way,"" Gobert said after the loss. Before the game against the Spurs, Utah coach Quin Snyder offered to split the fine with his center -- just this once. TIP-INS Spurs: The lack of aggressiveness showed as the Spurs attempted only six free throws through three quarters. ... Poeltl, who played collegiately at Utah, made his first six field goal attempts. ... The Spurs managed just two fast-break points to Utah's 13. Jazz: In the third quarter, Ingles tried to lob a pass to Gobert and swished it from 22 feet. ""That was pure luck,"" Ingles said. ... Utah had 38 assists on 51 baskets. ... The Jazz went 17 for 20 from the free-throw line, their best mark since the third game of the season and they tied a season high with 12 steals.","401071035"
"CLEVELAND --  Their fierce rivalry is over, reduced to only memories. The Warriors and Cavaliers had something special, four straight NBA Finals that Steph Curry will one day savor. Some day. ""It was historical,"" Curry said. ""I'll definitely sit back on the couch in 10 or 12 years when it's all over and think about what it was like to play here, and how high the stakes were every time we came into this building."" Right now, Curry and the Warriors aren't ready to reminisce. Curry made nine 3-pointers and scored 42 points, Kevin Durant added 25 and Golden State returned to face a very different looking Cleveland team for the first time since winning another NBA title and beat the Cavaliers 129-105 on Wednesday night. Fully healed after missing 11 games with a strained groin, Curry scored nine points in less than a minute midway through the fourth quarter to help the Warriors pull away for their eighth straight win over their former Finals rivals. Curry added nine rebounds and seven assists, and Durant had 10 rebounds and nine assists. It was Golden State's first visit to Cleveland since June, when the Warriors completed a sweep to win their third championship in four years. Nothing in Quicken Loans Arena felt or looked the same. ""The energy before the game, after the game,"" Durant said, noting the changes in Cleveland. ""There were more media members here the last couple of years. We were talking about that before we ran out on the floor. That was a circus right here during the Finals. You start thinking about the great memories you had, especially the championship. ""I'm sure we'll feel those feelings every time we walk into the building."" This was the first matchup between the Warriors and Cavaliers since LeBron James left as a free agent last summer. The Cavs are starting from scratch after a four-year run as Eastern Conference champions, and they're struggling without All-Star Kevin Love, who is recovering from foot surgery and while forward J.R. Smith is on a forced hiatus. There are no playoff plans in Cleveland, where fans are keeping as close an eye on Duke's talented freshmen players as what the Cavs are doing. Tristan Thompson, one of the only holdovers from those powerful Cavs teams, had 19 rebounds and 14 points. Rookie Collin Sexton scored 20 points for Cleveland. For Warriors coach Steve Kerr, the Golden State-Cleveland Finals, a four-act play loaded with drama and intensity, had it all. ""Some of the best basketball I've ever seen in my life,"" Kerr said before the game. ""Obviously, they have a new team and so you move on. Part of me is a little nostalgic for that."" But those days are gone. ""It's not a rivalry, it's another game,"" Kerr added. ""They're trying to build something and we're trying to continue our run for as long as we can."" The Warriors had trouble shaking the Cavs until Curry took control. Golden State's lead was just 10 when he got fouled while hitting a 3-pointer and completed the four-point play. He then buried another 3 and followed that with two free throws to put the Warriors ahead 116-99 with 5:34 left. Kerr isn't surprised Curry is back to being himself. ""It's pretty rare, but Steph is rare in general in everything he does,"" he said. ""We've seen it before where Steph was out with an injury and comes back and starts lighting it up right away. The guy keeps himself in amazing shape, which allows him to come back pretty quickly if there is an injury."" Rodney Hood's off-balance heave -- he caught the ball in and flung it toward the hoop -- gave Cleveland a 64-58 lead and capped an action-packed first half. With Hood scoring nine quick points, the Cavs opened with a 12-2 run, fell behind by eight and then made three 3-pointers and scored 11 points in the final 1:10. Curry scored 25 in the opening half, making six 3-pointers. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said F Draymond Green (sprained toe) could return as early as Monday when Golden State hosts Minnesota. Green has gradually increased his on-court work of late and Kerr said he ""had another good day today. He's really making strides."" Green rode the stationary bike in the hallway outside the Warriors locker room before the game. ... On a five-game road trip without a single back-to-back for the first time since 1985-86. ... C DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles) has started practicing and is making progress, but the team does not have a specific timeline for his return. ... Durant and Shaun Livingston were assessed technicals. Cavaliers: Thompson, too, said the Warriors-Cavaliers rivalry is officially over. ""It's in the past. New season. New team. Our ballclub is different and they've made some changes, but predominantly the same. That's all the last four years,"" Thompson said. ""That was great for the NBA. We're in a new chapter for our organization."" ... Coach Larry Drew said there is one positive to the Cavs no longer being an elite team. ""I get Christmas off this year, so I'm excited about that,"" he joked. Turning serious, Drew said he'll savor the best run in Cleveland history. ""I'll look back personally and just say, `Wow I was in the Finals four straight years' and that's something I'll always remember,"" he said.","401071036"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  To build a long winning streak, sometimes you need a little luck. The Denver Nuggets took sole possession of first place in the Western Conference with a 124-118 overtime victory over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. ""They did everything they could to win the game and we got lucky,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We'll take it, but we definitely got lucky."" Jamal Murray scored 31 points and the Nuggets shut down the Magic in overtime for their seventh straight victory. After Terence Ross tied it for Orlando with a 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Nuggets outscored the Magic 9-2 until Nikola Vucevic dunked for the Magic's first field goal of the overtime session with just 1:04 left. Ross' open jumper -- when the Magic needed three points in the final seconds -- was one of the reasons Malone called it ""one of our worst performances of the year."" Murray wouldn't go quite that far. ""We didn't play our best, but they played really good,"" said Murray, who also had eight assists. ""They had a great game, and they're a really underrated team, especially at home. They were making a lot of shots, more than we expected. It seemed like everybody was hitting."" The Magic kept up with the Nuggets with 57 percent shooting through three quarters, but made only 10 of 34 shots in the fourth quarter and overtime. ""I thought we played well offensively. Defensively we just couldn't get a stop,"" said Aaron Gordon, who had 19 points. ""Obviously our offense was more than good enough,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We competed hard, but at the end of the day we couldn't guard the high pick and roll the whole game, couldn't get a handle on it."" Paul Millsap added 18 points for Denver, which shot 55 percent for the game. Center Nikola Jokic had 12 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 26 points before fouling out in overtime and then drawing a second technical foul. Fournier thought the Nuggets' luck took a different form, resulting in their 37 foul shots to Orlando's eight. ""It's terrible, man, and that's why it's frustrating,"" he said. ""We're a team that never complains and we never get the calls. Then we start to say something and then we get the technicals. What is that?"" Vucevic added 24 points and 15 rebounds for Orlando, which made 20 of 43 3-pointers during regulation against the NBA's best 3-point defense. But the Magic made only one of nine shots in overtime and missed all six of their 3-pointers. The Nuggets made nine of their first 12 shots and broke out to a 22-10 lead, but Gordon scored 13 straight Magic points, including three 3-pointers, to get Orlando back in it. Neither team led by more than six points during the final three quarters. Denver took a five-point lead in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter, but Ross tied it 112-112. Murray missed a short jumper just before the buzzer, taking the game into overtime. AFTER NOT REVIEWING THE PLAY. . . The crowd erupted when a replay showed Murray stepping out of bounds with the ball just before being fouled with 20.8 seconds left in overtime. Referee Marc Davis explained: ""As per Rule 13, Section A, No. 17, an out-of-bounds may be reviewed if it is called or the officials have doubt as to whether the ball was out of bounds. It was never called out of bounds, and so there was no trigger. So it wasn't a reviewable matter."" TIP-INS Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed the entire game after injuring his right hip in the first quarter Monday night at Toronto. The Nuggets have not ruled him out for Friday night's game at Charlotte. ... The Nuggets missed 14 free throws, six more than the Magic attempted. Magic: A day after holding the Heat to just five free throws in a game at Miami, the Magic shot no free throws until Jonathan Isaac made two at 9:13 of the fourth quarter. ... Ross came off the bench for 17 points, his average over the last seven games.","401071037"
"ATLANTA --  Bradley Beal could tell early in the first quarter that the rebuilding Atlanta Hawks had no answer for him. ""Just being confident, just being aggressive,"" he said. ""Getting to the free throw line helped me out a lot. Being aggressive in that aspect. Just pretty much taking what they gave me."" Beal scored a season-high 36 points, Otto Porter Jr. had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and the Washington Wizards won their third straight game with a 131-117 victory over Atlanta on Wednesday night. Wizards star guard John Wall missed the game for personal reasons, but Washington still finished with a season-high 35 assists. Beal, with nine assists and nine rebounds, was a matchup nightmare for the Hawks, who began the night with the NBA's third-worst record and lost their fourth straight. John Collins finished with 14 rebounds and a career-high 26 points, and Kent Bazemore added 22 points for Atlanta. Rookie guard Kevin Huerter was the first Hawks player assigned to guard Beal, and he was replaced early. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce tried several combinations but nothing worked for long. Beal drew Collins, a 6-foot-10 forward, out to guard him in the third quarter and quickly cut past him. Rookie point guard Trae Young closed in the lane too late as Beal drove for a layup and a 19-point lead. Beal took the ball to the rim often enough to get to the foul line and hit 10 of 13 free throws. The Wizards finished 27 for 32 at the line. ""We have to play fast, and that was easier because we got stops defensively,"" Beal said. ""We were able to get out in transition and get some easy ones. We just continued to move the ball and share it."" The Hawks used a 45-point third, their highest-scoring quarter of the season, to pull within seven in the first minute of the fourth on Bazemore's jumper. Young had a chance to make it a three-point game but missed a wild layup attempt at the 9:48 mark, and Tomas Satorsky followed with a 3-pointer to push the lead to eight. Young, the fifth overall pick in this year's draft, took a hard spill 30 seconds later as he tried to shoot a 3 at the top of the arc, falling into Austin Rivers on the way down and getting his feet knocked out. Young landed on his back and elbows and stayed down before getting up to make one of three free throws. ""I didn't even see what happened,"" Young said. ""I was just in the air and I fell. My arms were numb, and it was hard to move. I was pressing on my free throws, pushing the ball instead of shooting it."" Beal answered with a runner and hit a pair of free throws on the ensuing possession to push the lead back to double digits. ""He's so crafty,"" Young said. ""He showed that tonight. With John being out, they were able to use him a lot more."" Rivers started in Wall's spot and had nine points, seven assists and seven rebounds. TIP-INS Wizards: It was the first game Wall has missed this season. Knee problems sidelined him for 41 games last season. Washington coach Scott Brooks didn't have an immediate timetable for Wall's return. ... F Jeff Green was sidelined with back issues for the second time in the last three games. ... Beal has scored at least 20 points 18 times this season. ... Rivers opened on the floor for the first time since starting 59 of his 61 games with the Los Angeles Clippers last season. ... Wall didn't play in a win last January in Atlanta, and the Wizards still posted 40 assists. Reserve guard Tim Frazier dished out 14 in that game. Hawks: Reserve G Jeremy Lin left with a lower back strain and didn't return after playing four minutes. ... Collins got his fourth double-double at the five-minute mark of the third. ... Bazemore started in place of F Taurean Prince, who injured his left ankle in Monday's loss to Golden State and will miss three weeks. ... Atlanta closed the third on an 11-0 run.","401071038"
"NEW YORK -- Once Paul George got going, he didn't slow down until he carried the Oklahoma City Thunder to their biggest comeback victory ever. George scored 25 of his 47 points in a sensational fourth quarter, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds left that gave the Thunder a 114-112 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. George rallied the Thunder from a 23-point deficit and finished a point shy of his career high, leading them to a fourth straight victory in a game they trailed big for much of the way. But they got close and then got the ball to George on their last possession, and there was no surprise that he nailed the shot. ""Yeah, it felt good,"" George said. ""I had the hot hand, I knew I had the hot hand. I just felt good all game."" Russell Westbrook had his 108th career triple-double to snap a tie with former Nets star and coach Jason Kidd for third in NBA history, finishing with 21 points, 17 assists and 15 rebounds. George's slow start helped send the Thunder into their big hole, but it was George who made sure they climbed out of it. And Westbrook made sure George knew not to lose his confidence even when his shot wasn't falling. ""My job is to make sure that I constantly keep telling him to stay aggressive, to play his game, because he's that type of guy, man,"" Westbrook said. ""He can get hot. He's a superstar in this league; and as you seen tonight, when he gets hot, he can change the game for us."" The Nets' Allen Crabbe scored 22 points and tied a season high with seven 3-pointers, but Brooklyn dropped its eighth straight game. Joe Harris added 19 points, yet the Nets lost in another close finish after falling just short in recent losses to Philadelphia, Memphis and finally Cleveland on a basket by Alec Burks. ""What's the definition of insanity? The same, over and over, and not changing, not adjusting,"" Nets veteran Jared Dudley said. ""At the end, I don't know if it's a switch or not a switch. Paul George hits a wide-open 3, Burks scores around a back dunk. It's like these game winners are the easiest game winners in NBA history. So, we got to figure out a way."" Brooklyn led by 18 after three quarters, at which point George had 22 points. But he heated up quickly in the fourth and there was no slowing him down, as he made four 3-pointers in the period and drove hard to the basket when the Nets did get to him at the arc. Still, it looked as though the Nets could withstand his flurry when he missed twice on a late possession. But the Thunder got another chance and George made it count, as he calmly took his time after Westbrook found him and delivered what ended up an easy look. Oklahoma City improved to 16-3 since its 0-4 start. Brooklyn led by only two after one quarter, then outscored Oklahoma City 36-22 in the second. Nets reserves outscored the Thunder by themselves, totaling 23 points. The Nets ran off the first 10 points to take a 36-24 lead, then used a 9-2 surge to open a 54-35 cushion on Crabbe's 3-pointer with 3:41 remaining in the half. The Thunder came into the game having outscored opponents by an NBA-high 97 points in the third quarter, but the Nets outscored them 31-29 in the period, getting three 3-pointers from Crabbe and going ahead by as much as 23 before taking a 93-75 advantage to the fourth. Tip-ins Thunder: George was just 1-for-6 in the first quarter. He finished with 15 rebounds. ... Steven Adams finished with 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Nets: Crabbe also made seven 3-pointers on Nov. 21 at Dallas. ... Robinson Cano, back in the Big Apple after being traded from the Seattle Mariners to the New York Mets on Monday, was at the game. Triple threat Westbrook, who owns the single-season record for triple-doubles and averaged one for a season when he was the league's MVP in 2016-17, said he was a fan of Kidd's. Kidd had the majority of his triple-doubles (61) while playing for the Nets from 2001 to 2008. ""To be able to pass him is something I never even dreamed about, so just honored,"" Westbrook said. Up next Thunder: At Chicago on Friday night. Nets: Host Toronto on Friday night.

"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard insisted he doesn't try to do anything extra in big games. His numbers suggest otherwise. Leonard had 36 points, Jonas Valanciunas scored 18 of his season-high 26 in the fourth quarter and the Toronto Raptors beat Philadelphia 113-102 on Wednesday night, handing the 76ers their 13th consecutive loss in Canada. Serge Ibaka added 18 points as the Raptors bounced back from Monday's loss to Denver to win for the ninth time in 10 games. Toronto, with the best record in the NBA at 21-5, improved to 11-3 at home. Leonard shot 13 for 24, finishing one point shy of his season high, and set a season best by making five of six attempts from 3-point territory. The rest of the Raptors struggled from long range, combining to shoot 3 for 23. Leonard's season high of 37 points came last Thursday in an overtime victory against two-time defending champion Golden State. Leonard has led Toronto in scoring in four straight games. ""He's an immense talent, he really is,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""And when the stakes go up a little bit, he's going to play his hand a little harder."" Leonard, who set a season best with five steals, said he doesn't let the opponent or circumstances dictate his effort. ""I try to perform every night,"" he explained. ""If you try to turn it on against the good teams, it's really hard to do that. You've got to do it on a nightly basis."" Leonard has never lost in 12 career meetings with the 76ers, including two victories this season. ""That's what you're going to get out of big-time players,"" Philadelphia's Jimmy Butler said. ""He had a great game."" Butler scored a season-high 38 points and added 10 rebounds. Joel Embiid had 10 points and 12 rebounds for Philadelphia, whose last win in Toronto was 93-83 on Nov. 10, 2012. ""Jimmy showed why he's an All-Star,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""He came in and gave us some tremendous things."" The day before, Brown suggested the game would be a ""barometer"" for the 76ers. Afterward, he said his team's 21 turnovers and 22 second-chance points allowed underscored the gap between the Sixers and Raptors. ""We leave disappointed,"" Brown said. ""We also leave, we feel, a little bit smarter about what it's going to take to beat the best team right now in the NBA."" Toronto's 17 offensive rebounds were a season high. ""We gave ourselves a chance to win with our effort but the execution just wasn't there,"" 76ers guard JJ Redick said. Redick scored 25 points and Ben Simmons had eight points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, who had their four-game winning streak snapped. The Raptors held a 78-77 lead after three quarters, and Philadelphia's T.J. McConnell tied it 81-all with a hook shot at 11:07. Valanciunas scored a pair of baskets as Toronto's reserves replied with a 9-0 run, opening a 90-81 advantage at 9:07. ""Our bench did an unbelievable job,"" Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. ""Tonight was one of those games where they just had it clicking."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid's double-double was his league-best 24th. ... The 76ers committed 11 turnovers in the second quarter. Toronto scored 27 points off Philadelphia's 21 total turnovers. ... Butler was called for a technical foul in the third quarter and Embiid got one in the fourth. Raptors: Lowry shot 0 for 5 in the first half and missed his first six attempts from 3-point range. ... Leonard led Toronto with nine rebounds. ... The Raptors outscored the 76ers 62-42 in the paint and 41-18 off the bench. ... Toronto has won 20 of the past 22 meetings with Philadelphia. ... G Malachi Richardson (illness) was inactive. 500 CLUB Leonard has 522 points in his first 20 games with Toronto, more than any other player in franchise history. He's the fourth active player to score 500 or more in his first 20 games with his current team. The others are Kevin Durant (Golden State), James Harden (Houston) and LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers). CAN'T HANDLE IT Simmons had seven turnovers, giving him 18 in two games against Toronto this season. STAR-STUDDED The game drew several celebrities who attended Tuesday's gala for Giants of Africa, the charity of Raptors president Masai Ujiri. That group included former Raptors All-Star Chris Bosh, former Blue Jays slugger Joe Carter, soccer player Didier Drogba, and comedian Chris Tucker.","401071040"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Mike Conley and the Memphis Grizzlies gave the Los Angeles Clippers a taste of how tough they can be on defense. The Grizzlies held Los Angeles to 34 percent shooting, caused 19 turnovers and limited the Clippers to a season-low in points in a 96-86 win Wednesday night. ""That's been the answer for years for us,"" Conley said of the defense. ""Regardless of what we do on the offensive end, we give ourselves a chance to win every night with the defensive performances we get from each individual guy."" Conley led Memphis with 22 points, while JaMychal Green had 19 points and 11 rebounds as the Grizzlies pulled away in the fourth quarter. ""We got the game won by playing defense and moving the ball as a team,"" Green said. Boban Marjanovic led the Clippers with a season-high 19 points, while Danilo Gallinari added 17 points. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lou Williams contributed 12 points apiece, with Williams hit 2 of 8 shots. ""It was the Grizzlies,"" coach Doc Rivers said of the poor shooting. ""They just defended us well. This is the first night that I can say that we got our butts kicked."" Despite the shooting woes, the Clippers were within 75-74 with just under nine minutes left, but Memphis rattled off eight straight points for an 83-74 lead, ending Los Angeles' hopes. The Clippers endured terrible first-half shooting, converting only 27 percent from the field, including 3 of 12 from outside the arc. That allowed Memphis to lead by as many as 15 in the second quarter before holding a 51-42 lead at the break. Despite the second-half push, Memphis was the one that imposed its will and pace in the game. ""We turned the ball over, just bad turnovers,"" Rivers said. ""We couldn't even run a 4-on-1 break."" TIP-INS Clippers: Tobias Harris missed all 10 of his shots through three quarters before connecting on a 3-pointer early in the fourth. ""I had shots that I normally make, and they just didn't fall,"" he said. ... Gallinari, among the league-leaders in free throw percentage, missed consecutive foul shots in the third and was 4 of 8 for the game. ... Montrezl Harrell had eight points, ending his streak of 13 straight games scoring at least 14 points off the bench. Grizzlies: Conley or Marc Gasol have led the Grizzlies in scoring in 12 of the last 13 games. .Kyle Anderson had six assists, one short of his season-best. .The 19 points and 11 rebounds were Green's first double-double of the season. WELCOME NOAH Joakim Noah played his first game since signing with the Grizzlies earlier this week after he was released by the Knicks at the start of the season. Noah played 13 minutes and scored four points. Grizzlies players said he brought an energy to the team in his first practice Tuesday. ""He came to practice yesterday giving us a spark,"" Green said. Conley added: ""It was fun playing alongside him for once because I've always been the recipient of all his screens. Now, that's a tool for me."" As for Noah, he was low-key in his comments. ""I'm really happy,"" Noah said. ""I don't expect anything anymore. I've been in this league for a while now, and sometimes you kind of take it for granted.""","401071041"
"MILWAUKEE --  The formula for success in Milwaukee doesn't always have to revolve around the high-scoring duo of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Eric Bledsoe matched his season high with 27 points and Antetokounmpo added 15 as the Bucks rolled to a 115-92 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. Middleton, the team's second-leading scorer at 18.5 points per game, was inactive for personal reasons. Antetokounmpo's output was 13 below his average, although he added a team-high eight rebounds. ""For other guys to step up when we needed, it's always a good sign,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We talk about being prepared for your opportunities, and different guys either get bigger opportunities, or get to play that haven't been playing."" Milwaukee countered an opening basket with nine consecutive points and did not trail after that. The Bucks led 30-21 after one quarter, 56-45 at halftime and then opened the third period with a 19-4 run. Bledsoe's 3-pointer put Milwaukee up 75-49 with 7:25 left in the third. ""If you're not making shots, you have to defend. I thought we guarded the 3-point line in stretches but not good enough,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""They play a different style so we have to get out and guard the 3-point line, but we did not do a good job of that tonight."" Blake Griffin had 31 points and Reggie Jackson scored 15 for the Pistons, who lost their second straight after a five-game winning streak. The Bucks, with the second-best record (16-7) in the East behind Toronto, improved to 12-2 at home. They are 4-5 on the road. Milwaukee was playing its first game since Saturday, while the Pistons were playing their fourth in six days. ""When you're in the middle part of that playoff race, everybody is fighting for something,"" Casey said. ""These next gauntlet games will be like that. Our fight level has to go up. I thought that group at the end (showed fight). The first group showed it in stretches, but we have to come out of the chute with the same fight."" Antetokounmpo was limited to six points in the first half on 3-of-8 shooting, but Bledsoe picked up the slack with 18 points, aggressively going to the basket. ""I had to, especially with one of our main guys out,"" Bledsoe said. ""Somebody had to have a good game."" Griffin kept the Pistons close in the first half with 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting, including 3 of 6 from beyond the arc. Milwaukee closed the first quarter with a 9-4 spurt. Two free throws by Thon Maker gave the Bucks their biggest lead of the half at 56-43. Detroit's bench was a combined 3 for 17 in the first half, missing all six 3-point attempts. TIP-INS Pistons: G Ish Smith strained his right groin and did not play in the second half. ""I don't think it's anything terrible. I should be fine,"" Smith said. ""It was real frustrating (not playing). We'll figure it out. We'll see what's the deal tomorrow after the MRI. I heal fast, so I should be all right."" EXAM WEEK Detroit entered with the fourth-best record in the East. After hosting two-time defending champion Golden State on Friday, the Bucks play at East-leading Toronto on Sunday. ""The Warriors, everybody knows how good they are, and how they test you, and then the same with Toronto,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think those are great for a team. You learn from them, really win or lose, and what it's going to take to play against the elite teams.""","401071042"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The air cleared following the trade of star Jimmy Butler, the Minnesota Timberwolves are talking more and winning as a result. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 35 points, Andrew Wiggins added a season-high 26 points and Minnesota beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-104 on Wednesday night for its sixth victory in seven games. Towns tied a career high with six blocks and had 12 rebounds. Wiggins tied season highs with six rebounds and five assists and the Timberwolves rallied again. ""I feel like it has changed,"" Wiggins said about the team's communication. ""I feel like everyone is just saying whatever is on their mind. Negative, positive, you just take it as a positive."" A back-and-forth affair turned on another strong defensive half for Minnesota, which limited Charlotte to 40 points on 31.3 percent shooting in the second half. Jeff Teague had a season-high 18 assists, and Taj Gibson added 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Wolves. Minnesota recovered from a 19-point deficit for its biggest comeback win of the season Monday night against Houston. Wiggins scored seven straight points at one point for the Wolves in the second quarter as they used a 22-7 run to erase a 15-point deficit. Minnesota credited a second-half meeting as the turning point against the Rockets. Trailing by two at halftime on Wednesday, the Wolves again used the discuss what had gone wrong. ""We came in here, we had another talk,"" Towns said. ""Every game, we're getting more and more close with each other. We came in here and we had a very great discussion, I'll call it, with each other on what we had to do. We understood what the hole was and how to get out of it. We proved to ourselves we could get out of any hole."" Jeremy Lamb had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Charlotte, and Nicholas Batum finished with 18 points. The Hornets have lost five of their past six games. ""They showed that the last 10, 15 games when they made the trade that they have a good defensive team,"" Batum said. ""We had a good lead in the second quarter and we stopped playing as a team, I think, and stopped moving the ball. You've got to give credit to their defense also."" Towns and Robert Covington, who came along with Dario Saric in the trade that sent Butler to Philadelphia, helped the Wolves pull away in the fourth. Towns had 11 points during a 22-2 run to take a 17-point lead in the fourth. Towns had 21 in the second half. Covington dealt with foul trouble in the first half but had 12 points in the second half and 17 for the game. Charlotte's reserves pushed the Hornets ahead in the second quarter. Charlotte started the quarter on a 20-6 run to open its biggest lead of the game at 15 points. Rookie Miles Bridges had a windmill dunk to begin the quarter and Frank Kaminsky hit a pair of 3s. ""Our margin for error is very small,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""The first half the ball was moving. We made 3's. We got to the rim. I liked our attacks in the first half. Second half, we went a little bit dry."" TIP-INS Hornets: Marvin Williams was out of the lineup for the first time this season with a right shoulder strain sustained in Sunday's loss against New Orleans. Williams has started every game at power forward this season. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist started in his place. ... Kemba Walker made his 502nd career start for Charlotte, the most of any player in team history. Walker passed Muggsy Bogues, who had made 501 starts. ...

He recovered with one of his better games of the season on Monday against Houston and then followed it up on Wednesday. It was the ninth career game for Wiggins with at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists. ""It feels good to be back,"" Wiggins said. ""I had a little stretch where I wasn't playing too well, but it happens. I just got back in the gym and I got back to myself.""","401071043"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis noticed that his rebounding numbers were lower than usual against the Dallas Mavericks. Davis also knew why, and he wasn't about to complain about it, as long as it was Pelicans teammate Julius Randle getting to the ball instead. ""He's playing physical. He wants to go get every rebound. He wants to make every shot. He's a perfectionist in my opinion, and that's a good thing about him,"" Davis said. ""He demands a lot of himself because he wants to win. When you've got a guy like that who's hungry for everything, every possession, every loose ball, it's going to make your team better."" Randle had 27 points and 18 rebounds and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Dallas Mavericks 132-106 on Wednesday night. Davis also scored 27 points to go with a career-high nine assists, five blocks and four rebounds -- nine below his average -- despite twisting his ankle and briefly leaving the court for treatment after stepping on Dorian Finney-Smith's foot in the third quarter. Davis said his ankle felt ""great"" after the game, and credited his spike in assists to the Pelicans finding a good rhythm by the end of the first quarter and sustaining it until the end. ""Guys are making shots and a lot of guys are playing with confidence and not afraid to take shots,"" Davis said after New Orleans shot 55.4 percent (51-of-92) overall and an even better 58.6 percent (17-of-29) from 3-point range. ""When guys are going to double-team me, once I get the ball in my hands, I've just got to make the right reads."" Jrue Holiday had 17 points and four steals for New Orleans, which largely controlled the contest while winning for just the third time in nine games. Harrison Barnes had 16 points and Wesley Matthews 15 for the Mavericks, who came in having won five of six but had trouble with the Pelicans' up-tempo pace while playing one night after beating Portland at home. ""We could not get it going from start to finish,"" Barnes said. ""It was not a great night for us, but we have to flush it and keep moving. ""You cannot make excuses for yourself and the schedule is what it is,"" Barnes added. ""You just have to go out there and play, and tonight we just did not compete at the level that we are used to competing at."" J.J. Barea scored 14 points, and Dwight Powell added 12 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which also was short-handed as usual starting guard Dennis Smith Jr. sat out with a sprained right wrist. ""We have to get home, get healed up as much as we can, and get ready to go,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. New Orleans never trailed after E'Twaun Moore's 20-foot jumper put the Pelicans up 32-31 at the end of the first quarter. Running the floor relentlessly, and effectively after many of the Mavs' 18 turnovers, the Pelicans scored 60 points in the paint and 29 on fast breaks. New Orleans led by 16 at halftime, by as many as 25 in the third quarter and 29 in the fourth. ""We wanted to come in, knowing they were on a back-to-back, and just push the ball and be aggressive,"" Davis said. TIP-INS Mavericks: As Powell dunked early in the fourth quarter, he was poked in eye by Davis. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle received a technical foul for shouting at officials about the play and Holiday made the technical foul shot. ... Finney-Smith had 12 points and Jalen Brunson had 11 points. ... The Mavs shot 42.9 percent (39-of-91) and missed 32 of 46 3-point attempts. Pelicans: F Nikola Mirotic, New Orleans' third-leading scorer, missed his second straight game with an illness. Randle started in his place. ... Darius Miller made four of his six 3-point shots for all of his 12 points off the bench while Moore made three of four. Davis made both of his shots from deep and Randle made two of three. ... Holiday, who has struggled with turnovers at times, finished with eight assists and only one turnover. LINEUP SHIFT With Randle moving from sixth man to starter, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry decided to try to solidify his second unity by moving usual starting wing E'Twaun Moore into a reserve role and start defensive-minded Solomon Hill. The Pelicans improved defensively and enjoyed a boost in bench scoring that allowed them to increase leads several times while starters rested. Moore finished with 17 points and six assists in 26:24 and made three of four 3s. ""If I come off the bench I don't care. I'm going to jump right into the fire with an aggressive mindset,"" Moore said. ""I'm definitely down for it. Anything to help the team win.""","401071044"
"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James had no idea why he was so tired. He slept 11 hours overnight, missing his company Christmas party in the process, and then had a 2 1/2-hour nap before the Los Angeles Lakers' game against San Antonio. Perhaps his body just knew he would need all that stored-up energy to hold off the Spurs during a frantic finish. James scored 20 of his 42 points in the fourth quarter and Josh Hart hit two clutch 3-pointers in the final minutes of the Lakers' fourth straight victory, 121-113 on Wednesday night. Kyle Kuzma had 22 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who lost Brandon Ingram to a sprained left ankle in the first quarter. Los Angeles still beat the Spurs for the first time in three tries this season, but only after James dramatically took control of another fourth quarter during his third 40-point game since joining the Lakers. ""It's the fourth quarter, and my teammates look at me to make plays,"" James said with a shrug. ""Sometimes it doesn't happen that way but I put that type of pressure on my back because I love my teammates giving me that responsibility."" James went 7 of 8 from the field with three 3-pointers in the fourth, but he was quick to point out he had plenty of help from younger Lakers, even after Ingram went down. Kuzma scored nine points in the fourth, including a key dunk on a pass from James with 2:13 left, while Hart and Lonzo Ball both hit big 3s. Everything added up to an impressive finish by the Lakers, who improved to 15-9 with their eighth win in their last nine home games. ""You just know"" when James is about to take over a game, Hart said. ""I've said it before. He's the best ever to put on a uniform. When it's happening, sometimes it's amazing. People should stop criticizing, shut up and enjoy his greatness."" DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points and Rudy Gay had a season-high 31 before fouling out for the Spurs in the first of back-to-back games in three days to wrap up the season series between these longtime West rivals. They'll meet again in San Antonio on Friday night. ""We made everything tough for them, (but) it got away from us in the fourth quarter,"" DeRozan said. ""Even though we were scoring, going back and forth, we couldn't get those critical stops when we needed them, and that killed us."" San Antonio held an eight-point lead in the fourth before James started a rally by scoring nine consecutive points. The Lakers hit seven 3-pointers in the final period while making 13 of 20 shots overall with one turnover. LaMarcus Aldridge had 21 points and nine rebounds for the Spurs, who have lost seven of 10. ""They made tough shots,"" Aldridge said. ""Guys competed and tried to keep guys in front of them, but they found the back side of the defense."" TIP-INS Spurs: Longtime Lakers big man Pau Gasol didn't get to play against his old team. He is out with a stress fracture in his left foot. ... Davis Bertans hit three 3-pointers but also drew a technical foul in the third quarter. ""I think I said one more word than I was supposed to,"" he explained. Lakers: Ingram had played at least 25 minutes in every game since he returned from a four-game suspension for fighting in Los Angeles' home opener. ... Ball had 14 points and nine assists, hitting three 3-pointers. INGRAM OUT Ingram left midway through the opening quarter after getting hurt while Aldridge committed a flagrant foul against him. The Lakers' third-leading scorer had X-rays that came back negative, but the Lakers seem to think he'll miss additional games. ""(Ingram) said they got him pretty good,"" coach Luke Walton said. The former No. 2 overall draft pick has been a key component of the Lakers' starting lineup around James, providing length on the perimeter and improving his drives to the hoop. BIG GAME FOR RUDY Gay poured in 16 points during the third quarter of his highest-scoring performance for the Spurs and a personal best for the injury-plagued scorer since Jan. 5, 2016. He had just one basket in the final 10 1/2 minutes before fouling out with 27 seconds left.","401071045"
"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving heard all of the doubts when the Celtics, who were among the favorites to win the Eastern Conference, still had a .500 record through Thanksgiving. The low point may have been a home loss to the Knicks that snapped New York's six-game losing streak. ""I was thinking about it since we lost to them,"" the Celtics point guard said after scoring 22 points to coast past the Knicks 128-100 on Thursday night and exact a measure of revenge for the embarrassing earlier loss. ""I remember players from other teams asking about what's going on when we were 10-10."" Irving also had eight assists before leaving the game with about four minutes left, rubbing his right shoulder and swinging it around in pain. He raised his hand for coach Brad Stevens to take him out of the game but couldn't get his attention and instead walked to the bench at the next whistle. The shoulder was wrapped in ice when he walked off the court at the end of the game. Irving thought it was his AC joint and said he would be OK. ""I think he got hit,"" Stevens said. ""He didn't seem too concerned about it, but he's going to get looked over, as usual."" Al Horford had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Boston, and Jaylen Brown returned after missing three games with a bruised lower back and scored a season-high 21 points. Jayson Tatum added 17 for the Celtics, who won their fourth straight game. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 22 for New York, which has lost four of its last five games. Enes Kanter had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Noah Vonleh had 12 and 10. ""Not going to win in this league giving up 30 points per quarter,"" Hardaway said. ""Need to do a better job as a team and individually, including myself."" NOT EVEN CLOSE The Celtics scored the first three baskets of the game and never trailed. They led by eight after one, by 11 after two and by 15 points after scoring eight straight to make it 97-82 near the end of the third quarter. New York was within 12 with five minutes remaining before Boston scored the next 11 points on baskets from five different players. ""Terrible defense tonight. We just didn't have it,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Thought we were right there slugging away with them, but in the fourth we couldn't keep up."" LAST TIME The Celtics, who went to the Eastern Conference finals last year, were expected to be one of the league's top teams after getting Irving and Gordon Hayward back from injuries. But New York won 117-109 in Boston on Nov. 21 loss and sent the Celtics to their third loss in a row. Stevens wondered aloud after that one whether his team was ""that good."" ""Maybe it's not a wake-up call if you keep getting beat,"" he said. But Boston is 5-1 since then. ""Disappointing loss against them recently here,"" Horford said on Thursday. ""We just wanted to come out and set the tone from the beginning and I felt like we were able to do that. ... We played much better, and I felt better tonight."" TIP-INS Knicks: Both teams shot better than 60 percent in the first quarter, but the Knicks were just 8 for 26 in the second. ... Hardaway went down to the floor after taking an elbow from Marcus Morris Sr. in the head. The play was ruled a flagrant foul. Hardaway returned a few minutes later. ... Kanter had his seventh double-double in his last nine games. Celtics: The Celtics wore green, white and yellow jerseys reminiscent of the 1980s, and they enhanced the theme by using graphics on the scoreboard from the time. During breaks, they showed video of a Green Line train approaching the original Boston Garden on elevated tracks, neither of which exists anymore. ... Aron Baynes limped off in the last two minutes of the first quarter. The team said he had a left ankle injury and he did not return.","401071046"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Jake Layman hadn't played in Portland's last five games, so he wanted to make the best of it when he did get his chance. Layman came off the bench to score a career-high 24 points and the Trail Blazers snapped a three-game losing streak with a 108-86 rout of the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. ""I just went out there and tried to be aggressive, play within our offense and not do anything too crazy,"" he said. ""I was getting open shots. Damian (Lillard) was finding me, other guys were finding me."" Layman, who scored 15 points in just under six minutes in the first quarter, started earlier this season but had not played since Maurice Harkless returned from a knee injury to the starting lineup. ""He (Layman) came out of the starting lineup, had a good attitude, worked hard, knew he was going to get an opportunity at some point and remained positive while he wasn't playing. And he took advantage of the opportunity when he did come in,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Lillard added 25 points and eight assists before sitting for the final quarter for Portland, which led by as many as 31 points. It was a welcome win for the Blazers, who had lost six of their last seven games. Troy Daniels had a season-high 15 points for the struggling Suns, who were held to nine points in the first quarter for the second consecutive game and have lost seven straight. Phoenix has just four victories this season, and just one on the road. The Suns relied heavily on three rookies, Elie Okobo, Mikal Bridges and center Deandre Ayton while missing T.J. Warren for the fourth straight game because of right ankle soreness and Devin Booker for the second game because of a left hamstring strain. Booker is the team's top scorer, averaging 23.5 points, while Warren averages 17.7. ""It's a challenging time for us as a team,"" said Suns coach Igor Kokoskov. ""Obvioulsy, we're a young group ... When the challenging moments come, you have to show toughness."" The Blazers were without starting guard CJ McCollum because of a sprained left ankle. McCollum was hurt in the fourth quarter of Portland's 111-102 loss at Dallas on Tuesday. Seth Curry started in his place against the Suns. The Blazers barely missed McCollum, jumping out to a 26-5 lead after Lillard's 3-pointer. Lillard and Layman both had 15 points in the period. Portland led by as many as 27 points in the first half and went into the break ahead 62-41. The gap remained at 20-plus points throughout the third quarter as the Blazers took an 87-61 lead into the final period. Suns guard Jamal Crawford showed frustration at the end of the third by slamming the ball down before heading to the bench. It was the first of a back-to-back for the Suns, who host Miami on Friday. ""Losing is tough,"" Suns forward Trevor Ariza said. ""It's really tough but at this point all I can really do is continue to be positive and continue to encourage our younger players to try and be better at the start of games.""

"SALT LAKE CITY --  No Rudy Gobert proved to be no problem for the Jazz on defense. Utah smothered the Houston Rockets for the better part of four quarters en route to a 118-91 victory Thursday night. The Jazz pestered and pressed Houston into coughing up the ball repeatedly, especially after halftime. The Rockets gave up 22 turnovers and allowed Utah to score 33 points off them. Both were season highs for a Houston opponent. The Jazz played the bulk of the game without their starting center after Gobert was ejected less than three minutes into the game. He picked up his first foul on the opening tip. After picking up his second at the 9:13 mark of the first quarter, Gobert was tossed after swatting a paper cup off the scorer's table in frustration. Gobert drew a $15,000 fine from league officials earlier in the week for criticizing the officiating crew following Utah's 102-100 loss to Miami on Sunday. His response to the officials ended up being more subdued this time around. ""I just came in to try to play basketball,"" Gobert said. ""Fouls were called and I had a stupid reaction. I think I can blame myself more than anything for that one."" Derrick Favors stepped up in Gobert's absence. Favors totaled a season-high 24 points on 10-of-13 shooting and 10 rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench. ""When Rudy went out, I had an opportunity to just go out and be aggressive and take advantage of the opportunity that was given to me,"" Favors said. ""That's what I did and it paid off for me."" Joe Ingles added 18 points and six rebounds for the Jazz. Utah (13-13) won for the fourth time in five games to climb back to .500. Everything unraveled for Houston starting in the third quarter. The Jazz opened up the second half with a 15-2 spurt. Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder each scored a pair of baskets on Utah's first four possessions to ignite the decisive run that gave the Jazz a 68-47 lead. Houston committed four turnovers in that stretch, leading to eight points for Utah. ""They were driving and kicking and being more active,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""They were more athletic, getting to the rim. They just beat us in every which way they could."" the Rockets finished with eight turnovers in the quarter and gave up more points off turnovers (15) than they scored (11). Favors bookended Jazz baskets over three straight possessions with a dunk and a hook shot to give Utah its largest lead at 91-54. ""They got off to a really good start in that third quarter,"" Rockets guard James Harden said. ""They made shots. We didn't make shots. We made a couple of mental errors on defense and they capitalized."" Harden scored 15 points while Chris Paul and Clint Capela added 12 apiece for the Rockets. Houston (11-13) allowed an opponent to pull away in the second half for a second straight game after committing a season-high 22 turnovers and giving up a season-high 33 points off those turnovers. Utah adjusted well to Gobert's early absence. The Jazz ripped off an 11-0 run to take a 27-16 lead near the end of the first quarter. Favors ignited the spurt with a pair of dunks. Dante Exum finished it off by slashing to the rim on back-to-back possessions for a pair of baskets. ""The game is always going to throw you adversity,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's wrapped in different ways. The way that Derrick responded was terrific. TIP INS Rockets: Michael Carter-Williams scored a season-high 13 points off the bench. . Houston totaled a season-low 11 third-quarter points. That also represented a season low for a Utah opponent. . The Rockets gave up more than 100 points for the 10th consecutive game. Jazz: Exum had a season-high 15 points. . Utah outscored Houston 16-4 in fast-break points and finished with a 70-42 advantage on points in the paint. .

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nic Batum knew exactly what was coming when fellow Frenchman Tony Parker raced down the court with a head of steam on a fast break. Parker stopped momentarily planting his right foot, then spun 360 degrees to avoid a defender and scored on a layup on the other side of the rim. The 36-year-old Parker proved again he can still make some pretty slick plays and is a valuable asset down the stretch of tight games, scoring 19 points to help the Charlotte Hornets snap the Denver Nuggets' seven-game win streak with a 113-107 victory on Friday night. Kemba Walker had 21 points and eight assists, Marvin Williams added 14 points and 10 rebounds and the Hornets picked up their first win this season against a Western Conference opponent. ""I've seen that move so many times,"" said a grinning Batum, who also played with Parker on the French national team. ""I kind of laughed when he did it. I told him, `I've been waiting for that move.' They changed the rule in Europe because of that move. They now call it traveling over there."" Coach James Borrego called it ""vintage Parker."" Parker, now in his 18th NBA season, made big plays throughout as the Hornets ended a three-game skid. Charlotte built a 64-53 halftime lead behind Parker, who had 13 points, three assists and a steal and provided a jolt of energy in a pivotal second quarter. And when the Nuggets rallied from 11 down with three minutes remaining and cut the lead to three with 1:13 left on a 3-pointer from Monte Morris, Parker drove the left side of the lane and hit a big step-back 17-foot jumper to make it a two-possession game. ""The bigger the moment the better he is,"" Williams said of Parker. ""He's a champion and he has experience in those situations and it's great to have a teammate like that."" The Nuggets looked to cut it back to three on the next possession, but Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had huge block against the glass on Juancho Hernangomez with 24 seconds left. Walker hit three free throws in the final 14 seconds to put the game away. Walker finished the game 11 of 12 from the free throw line, offsetting a tough 4-of-11 shooting night. ""Tony Parker made some tough shots on me down the stretch,"" Morris said. ""I mean I played great defense, got two good contests. I mean he's a vet, 17 years in the game, so that's his go-to move."" Denver came in the with the best record in the Western Conference, but shot 39 percent from the field and 23 percent from 3-point range. The Hornets put the clamps on Nikola Jokic for most of the game, holding the 7-foot, 250-pound center to 16 points and 11 rebounds. Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with 20 points. TIP INS Nuggets: Will Barton, Gary Harris, Michael Porter Jr. and Isaiah Thomas did not play due to injuries. ... Torrey Craig had a rough night in his return to the Carolinas as the former South Carolina Upstate star was held scoreless and fouled out. Hornets: Carolina Panthers defensive end Julius Peppers took in the game from courtside seats. A certain future NFL Hall of Famer, Peppers once played basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels and remains a big basketball fan. MILLSAP LEAVES WITH FOOT INJURY Nuggets forward Paul Millsap left the game with a foot injury, leaving his status for Saturday night's game at Atlanta up in the air. ""If Paul is unable to go tomorrow night that's an opportunity for somebody else,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""And that means somebody else moves into the lineup and somebody else has got an opportunity off the bench."" STRONG BENCH The Hornets bench outscored the Nuggets 59-40, as they got 16 points from Mail Monk and 11 from Frank Kaminsky. ""They've been huge for us all year,"" Williams said. ""I mean we wouldn't be winning games if we didn't have those guys. So many times the starters may not have had it early or may not have had it late, they've come in the game and made plays. It's been guy after guy.""","401071049"
"Chiney Ogwumike explains why Joel Embiid should be happy with the way the 76ers are performing as a whole with the addition of Jimmy Butler. (1:11) DETROIT --  The Philadelphia 76ers gave their standout center a night off, fell behind by 15 points on the road -- and then came back to beat the Detroit Pistons anyway. ""This was our best win of the year under those circumstances,"" coach Brett Brown said. Jimmy Butler scored 38 points, and the 76ers overcame Joel Embiid's absence Friday night, rallying from a sizable third-quarter deficit to beat the Pistons 117-111. Blake Griffin had 31 points and 12 rebounds for Detroit, but the Pistons squandered their 15-point third-quarter lead, as well as a six-point advantage in the fourth. The 76ers rested Embiid, who missed his first game of the season, but Detroit couldn't take advantage of the big man's absence. Butler, who also scored 38 points in a loss at Toronto on Wednesday night, had 26 in the second half Friday, but it was Philadelphia's fourth-quarter defense that stood out. Detroit shot 9 of 26 from the field in the fourth. The Pistons attempted 33 free throws in the first three quarters, but they took only four in the final period as Philadelphia defended the rim impressively. ""Defense is always going to win games,"" Butler said. ""Especially late in the year, which is what we want to end up playing."" The Pistons led 71-56 in the third before Philadelphia went on a 22-5 run to take the lead. Detroit was up 98-92 in the fourth, but the 76ers went on a 16-2 tear to take control. The Pistons were up 100-97 when Detroit coach Dwane Casey received a technical foul arguing a foul call. JJ Redick made the free throw, and then added a 3-pointer to put Philadelphia ahead to stay. The 76ers then ran off another seven points in a row. Griffin received a technical of his own in the last couple minutes of the game. Philadelphia had 30 points off 18 Detroit turnovers. ""I like our guys' effort. I like our guys' fight,"" Casey said. ""They're scratching and clawing but you have to take care of the ball. If you turn the ball over against any team in the NBA, you're not going to survive very long."" TOUGH TO HANDLE Griffin scored 50 points in an overtime win over Philadelphia in October, and then had 38 in a loss to the 76ers the following month. He filled up the stat sheet again Friday, but Philadelphia held him to only five points in the fourth quarter. The teams will meet again Monday. BIG GAME Mike Muscala scored 18 points for Philadelphia and played key minutes after Amir Johnson fouled out. Muscala had three of the 76ers' 12 blocks. ""I thought defensively, at the end of the game, those last four or five minutes, I thought he was excellent,"" Brown said. ""We needed it all and his versatility, where he can take Drummond away from the basket and make those perimeter shots."" INJURIES Detroit was missing Reggie Bullock (left ankle sprain) and Ish Smith (right adductor tear), and Stanley Johnson (sore left knee) was a late scratch. In addition to Embiid, the 76ers were also without Markelle Fultz (thoracic outlet syndrome), Justin Patton (right foot surgery) and Zhaire Smith (left foot fracture). TIP-INS 76ers: Redick and Ben Simmons had 18 points apiece. Pistons: Griffin made 17 free throws in 24 attempts -- both career highs. ... Drummond scored 21 points and Reggie Jackson added 13. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Indiana Pacers left a lot better after playing the Orlando Magic. The Pacers routed the Magic 112-90 behind 26 points from Bojan Bogdanovic and 15 points from reserve guard Cory Joseph. They also overcame a bout with food poisoning that kept top reserve Domantas Sabonis out of the game and affected several players and coach Nate McMillan. None of it showed as Indiana beat Orlando for the eight straight time and 15th time in the last 16 meetings. ""I feel pretty dizzy right now,"" said McMillan, who looked uncomfortable before tipoff, but coached the entire way. ""That was a solid game from start to finish against a very good team."" ""I guess the guys who played must have ate at a different restaurant because we played with a lot of energy,"" added Pacers reserve Kyle O'Quinn, who had 12 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Thaddeus Young had 14 points and eight rebounds, and Tyreke Evans had 11 points for the Pacers. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 22 points and 10 rebounds and Aaron Gordon had 20 points and 14 rebounds. Terrence Ross added 11 for Orlando, which allowed Indiana to shoot 50 percent for most of the game before the Pacers reserves went dry in the final three minutes and let the final percentage slip to 47.3 percent. ""At either end of the floor, it looked like our first six or seven games of the year,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said, referring to the team's 2-6 start. ""We were disorganized, bad shots, no pressure on the defense, never into the ball, bad basketball."" The Pacers took control in the middle of the third quarter and were never challenged the final 16 minutes. Indiana led by 12 at halftime, but Orlando rallied quickly in the second half, cutting it to 63-59 on Gordon's dunk with 7:42 left in the third period. Indiana responded with a 15-2 run that Evans started with a driving layup and finished with a fallaway 3-pointer. ""I have to see that stretch again because it was a blur,"" Gordon said about the Pacers fast runaway. ""It's a little frustrating, but it's nothing to lose our minds over. I believe in this team. I believe we're a good team. We have to stick with it."" Indiana's defense took away the perimeter game from a Magic team that had made 20 3-pointers the previous game against Denver. The Magic were eight for 33 (24.2 percent) on 3-pointers against the Pacers. Bogdanovic hit 9 of 13 shots and had 21 points in the first half when the Pacers patiently ran through options to find open shots on the perimeter, a tactic they kept working the entire game. The Magic survived a scare in the first quarter when Vucevic stayed on the floor clutching his ankle after coming down on Turner's foot. The Magic center limped over to the bench and took a seat, but was back in for the final 7:21 of the second period. TIP-INS PACERS: SG Victor Oladipo's sore knee kept him out for the ninth straight game. ... Indiana is 8-6 on the road this season, one of only two Eastern Conference teams with winning road records. MAGIC: Ross has scored in double figures in eight straight games, averaging 17.4 points while shooting 51.4 percent (52 of 101). ... Vucevic has double-doubles in six of his last seven games, averaging 24.4 points and 12.2 rebounds during that stretch. ...

"NEW YORK --  Kawhi Leonard's short shot went in and out. Fred VanVleet's 3-pointer went around the rim and spun out. For 3 1/2 years, the Toronto Raptors had always found a way to beat the Brooklyn Nets. This time, not one, but two chances just wouldn't fall. ""Just how the game goes sometimes,"" Leonard said. That allowed the Nets to snap an eight-game losing streak overall and a 12-game skid against the Raptors with a 106-105 victory in overtime on Friday night. D'Angelo Russell scored 29 points, including six in overtime, and the Nets beat the Raptors for the first time since April 3, 2015. ""Needed that. Really did,"" Russell said. ""It was tough. We knew what we (had) to do to get it. So now we just got to keep going."" Jarrett Allen made the go-ahead basket for the Nets with a little more than a minute left, their only basket in overtime not made by Russell. Leonard scored 32 points for the Raptors, but Toronto couldn't get a look for him on its final possession and had to settle for VanVleet's 3-pointer that just missed. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 17 points for Brooklyn, which had been regularly falling short during its losing streak. The Nets had lost five times by single digits, including three two-point losses. Jonas Valanciunas added 24 points for the Raptors. The Nets led by seven with under 5 minutes remaining in regulation, but Leonard fed VanVleet for a 3-pointer and then scored the next six points himself to give Toronto a 96-94 edge with 2:23 to play. But his shot from in the lane rattled out with 7 seconds to play. ""Ball was in and out,"" Leonard said. He then he blocked Dinwiddie's shot on the other end to force OT. Russell had the first two baskets in the extra session, Leonard made the next two, but the Raptors couldn't get one more shot to fall and take a victory before their schedule turns tough. ""They scored four points in about the first 40 seconds of the overtime and then we held them to four the rest of the overtime. They ended up with eight but we didn't do too much better,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. The Bucks now host Milwaukee on Sunday before a four-game trip to the Clippers, Golden State, Portland, and Denver. The Bucks are second in the East and three of the West teams are among the top four in that conference. The Nets jumped to a 13-2 lead and were ahead 24-20 at the end of Leonard's 0-for-4 first quarter, but he came back with nine points in the second as Toronto tied it at 53 at halftime. ""I just tried to make it tough for him. He's a phenomenal player. Last five games he's been averaging 30, just being aggressive and being himself,"" Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson said. ""Just tried to speed him (up), make him take tough shots, make him turn, make him pick it up, settle for midrange."" TIP-INS Raptors: NBA assists leader Kyle Lowry had 11 but was just 1 for 8 from the field for three points. ... The Raptors missed their first eight 3-point attempts before Delon Wright made one in the final minute of the first quarter. ... Valanciunas made just his 10th start of the season, with Serge Ibaka coming off the bench. Nets: Allen finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. ... The Nets had lost six straight at home to Toronto. LOWRY'S LAMENT Lowry threw a good pass to VanVleet on the final possession but was hard on himself afterward for his own poor shooting. ""Just got to play better,"" he said. ""I don't make excuses. I don't have any excuses to make. I'm just not playing well."" NO PROBLEM Coach Kenny Atkinson said he had no problem with Jared Dudley's comments after they blew a 23-point loss to Oklahoma City on Wednesday, when the veteran forward criticized the team for its repeated mistakes in crunch time. Atkinson said he respected Dudley's honesty, adding that at his urging the players held a film session without coaches during their off day so they could attempt to find solutions themselves.","401071052"
"CLEVELAND --  De'Aaron Fox and the Sacramento Kings found their stride in the second half. The Cleveland Cavaliers just couldn't keep up. Fox had 30 points and 12 assists, and the Kings beat the Cavaliers 129-110 on Friday night. ""We played with a lot more communication and physicality in the second half,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said, ""and we knew we needed to."" Buddy Hield added 25 points for the Kings, who led by as many as 25 after the game was tied at 66 at halftime. Marvin Bagley III scored 17 points on 8-for-9 shooting after missing two games due to back spasms. Sacramento led by 15 midway through the first quarter, but a lack of defense and some hot shooting by Cleveland changed the momentum. ""It was a learning experience,"" Hield said. ""It's the NBA and teams are good. They'll make their runs. We have to find a way to stay locked in."" Fox and Hield each hit two 3-pointers in the first five minutes of the third quarter, helping Sacramento open an 84-73 lead. ""I kind of let the game come to me,"" said Fox, who fell one point short of his career high. ""Sometimes I do know that it starts with me so I took the initiative to make that happen."" Jordan Clarkson scored 26 points for Cleveland, and rookie point guard Collin Sexton had 23. But the Cavaliers couldn't keep up with the Kings' fast pace. ""I felt like they really exposed us in every area,"" coach Larry Drew said. ""I haven't felt like that all year as far as opponents are concerned."" Cleveland was short-handed after it agreed to a three-team trade with Milwaukee and Washington. The Cavs got Matthew Dellavedova back from the Bucks, who also parted with forward John Henson and two draft picks in 2021. Guard George Hill went from Cleveland to Milwaukee as part of the deal, and Sam Dekker was traded from the Cavs to the Wizards. The Cavs then lost Rodney Hood to a right foot injury. He didn't play in the second half. The Kings (13-11) have won three straight, including the first two on their four-game trip. Sacramento came out with a hot first quarter for the second straight game. Drew used a timeout 86 seconds into the game after the Kings hit their first three shots and led 7-2. Sacramento made 17 of 26 shots in the period. Sacramento outscored Phoenix 36-9 in the opening quarter Tuesday. The Cavaliers (5-20) regrouped in the second quarter. Sexton scored 14 points and Clarkson's 3-pointer at the buzzer tied the game. NO WORD Drew didn't know if Hood will be available when the Cavaliers host Washington on Saturday night. GOOD DUEL Fox is in his second season while Sexton, the eighth pick in the draft, played in his 25th career game. ""He's a good player,"" Sexton said.

"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls endured injuries to key players and a coaching change this week. Maybe now, the tide is turning for them. Lauri Markkanen scored 24 points and drove for the go-ahead layup in the closing seconds to lead the Bulls to a 114-112 victory over Oklahoma City on Friday and their first win under coach Jim Boylen. The Thunder's Russell Westbrook had just hit a tying layup when Markkanen spun around Paul George and banked in a layup over the outstretch arm of Steven Adams, making it 114-112 with 4.9 seconds left. George's 3-point attempt from the top of the key then ricocheted off the rim, and the Bulls came out on top after dropping seven in a row. ""We've had a couple of rough weeks here,"" Markkanen said. ""Adversity hit us. I think that made us stronger. (We) have to put the team first and just keep going."" The last-second victory over one of the top teams in the Western Conference was a rare feel-good moment for Chicago in a season marked by injuries, losses and a coaching change. ""We have to learn how to win,"" Boylen said. ""We have to learn how to take the pressure of an NBA fourth quarter. I thought we did that."" A longtime NBA assistant, Boylen took over Monday when Fred Hoiberg got fired following a 5-19 start. The Bulls lost at Indiana the following night in his debut. But with Markkanen back and Kris Dunn and Bobby Portis just about ready to return from their injuries, things are looking at least a little more promising. ""You can't give in,"" said Zach LaVine, who led Chicago with 25 points. Markkanen hit four 3-pointers in his third game back after missing the first 23 because of a sprained left elbow. Justin Holiday scored 20, going 4 of 6 from beyond the arc, and Jabari Parker finished with 16 points. The Thunder had won 16 of 19 following an 0-4 start and came in with a 13-0 record against teams below .500. ""A slip up is all it is tonight,"" George said. ""We dropped one. But we're going to keep it rolling."" They couldn't pull this one out despite getting 24 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists from Westbrook.

TIGHT STRETCH The Thunder outscored Chicago 29-17 in the third quarter to turn a 70-62 halftime deficit into a 91-87 lead going into the fourth. They were up 98-91 when Chicago went on a 14-2 run. LaVine hitting a tiebreaking 3, Wendell Carter Jr. had a big block against a driving Westbrook, and Markkanen added two free throws to make it a five-point game with 4:46 remaining. ""We held them to 44 in the second half and gave up 70 in the first,"" coach Billy Donovan said. ""When you live dangerously like that, sometimes you're not going to be on the winning end."" TIP-INS Thunder: Donovan said ""nothing was brought to my attention"" about possibly adding C Joakim Noah, trying to revive his career after signing with Memphis this week. ""Our roster's pretty complete so that's probably the biggest thing,"" he said. ""No one's a bigger fan and admires him more than I do.""

"NEW ORLEANS --  JaMychal Green's move to a reserve role since coming back from his broken jaw seems to suit the Memphis forward. Green scored six of his season-high 24 points during a late comeback and the Grizzlies beat the New Orleans Pelicans 107-103 on Friday night. The fourth-year pro out of Alabama has posted season highs in points in consecutive games, having scored 19 in a victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night. ""Yeah, I'm getting in a groove. I'm starting to get my legs back and get into a rhythm,"" said Green, who started the first two games before his injury. He said the transition to coming off the bench ""wasn't hard at all."" ""Coach (J.B. Bickerstaff) and I had a talk and he told me I was still going to get my minutes, so I was cool with that,"" Green said. Kyle Anderson scored 19 points, including a key free throw for a four-point lead in the final seconds for the Grizzlies, who whittled away at an eight-point deficit during the final five minutes to send New Orleans to its fourth loss in 14 home games. During that pivotal stretch, Green hit a jumper, sank two free throws and dunked to tied it at 101 with 2:35 left. Memphis finished with 53-11 advantage in bench points, and Green was a big reason why. ""He made some big plays for us in a very timely manner,"" Anderson said. ""I know he's a selfless guy and he's a guy that just wants to play to win. It really shows in his character, accepting a role to come off the bench."" Julius Randle had 26 points and 13 rebounds, Anthony Davis added 25 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots, and Jrue Holiday had 20 points and 11 assists for the Pelicans. But New Orleans was done in by poor 3-point shooting (7 of 29), 18 turnovers that led to 26 Memphis points and some crucial missed free throws down the stretch. ""If you make some of those (3-pointers) at certain times in the game, we open up the game and I think it'd be a different story,"" Holiday said. New Orleans missed only four of 24 free throws, but three of those misses came in the final 4:11, with Holiday missing one and Randle two. The Pelicans did not hit field goal during the final five minutes. Davis and E'Twaun Moore both missed 3-point shots in the final 15 seconds that would have tied it. ""You've got to finish games. You know, I mean that's just the bottom line. It's not really complicated. It's a simple thing,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We competed at a real high level, but not only do you have to compete, you have to execute down the stretch."" The game was competitive throughout, with 10 ties and 18 lead changes. Neither team built a double-digit lead. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Marc Gasol had 15 points. ... Joakim Noah added 13 points in his second game since signing with the Grizzlies. ... Mike Conley handed out 10 assists. ... Memphis improved to 7-6 on the road. ...

Pelicans: F Nikola Mirotic returned from an illness that sidelined him for two games. Although he has started most of this season, he came off the bench against Memphis, playing 20 minutes and scoring only four points on 1-of-6 shooting. ...... Guard Tim Frazier sank a half-court heave as time expired in the third quarter, cutting Memphis' lead to 85-84. HILL'S CLIMB Solomon Hill scored a season-high 14 points for New Orleans, hitting four of six 3-point attempts. His previous season high was six points in three different games and he had not scored more than 13 since April 4, 2017. But Hill was in no mood to discuss his scoring. ""I've got to make the stops on defense. That's why I'm here,"" Hill said. ""We have enough firepower to score."" SHUT-DOWN DEFENSE The Pelicans missed their final eight shots from the field, with six misses coming from 3-point range. Anderson said Memphis' defense had a lot to do with New Orleans' lower-percentage perimeter shots. ""Credit our guys for digging deep and getting some stops, making them take tough shots and rebounding,"" Anderson said.","401071055"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Jakob Poeltl and Davis Bertans walked off the court to huge cheers and the embrace of San Antonio Spurs veterans Pau Gasol and LaMarcus Aldridge. In a game filled with All-Stars like Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan and LeBron James, the Spurs relied on a gritty effort from Poeltl, Bertans and their bench to salvage a victory. DeRozan finished with 36 points and nine assists and the Spurs had eight players score in double figures in a 133-120 come-from-behind victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night. James finished with 35 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for Los Angeles, but was held to four points and no rebounds in the fourth quarter. James bristled when told Bertans and Poeltl were not players anyone expected would beat the Lakers. ""Why not,"" James said. ""Why wouldn't you think they could beat you? They're NBA players. They made big shots. Bertans made big shots. He made four 3s in the fourth quarter."" The Spurs' young posts combined to score 23 points in the final quarter, with Poeltl finishing with 14 and Bertans 13. ""We really clicked with our second unit,"" Poeltl said. ""We had so much fun together out there playing. I sure found my spots there."" The Spurs' bench outscored the Lakers' 52-26, including 14 from Patty Mills, in winning the season series 3-1. Los Angeles led by as many as 15 points, but was outscored 32-13 beginning early in the fourth quarter and fell behind 121-114. ""We can't give our foot off the gas,"" Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma said. ""I think we did that a little bit in the fourth slowing down a little bit. Defensively, we obviously need to do better."" Kuzma finished with 27 points and Lonzo Ball had 13 points and 11 assists for the Lakers. DeRozan had 11 points in the fourth quarter and San Antonio was 4 for 7 from beyond the arc in its comeback. The run turned Aldridge into a spectator as Poeltl played all but one minute in the fourth and Bertans played 10 minutes. Aldridge didn't seem to mind, actively cheering from the bench and joining the injured Gasol in greeting Poeltl and Bertans with a smile and high-fives after they exited the game in the final minute. ""That group was playing well, so we left them out there and they were wonderful,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. The Spurs opened the fourth quarter on an 18-6 run and pulled within 108-107 with 7:43 remaining. Mills punctuated the run with a layup after drawing a foul on James near the Spurs' bench that led to his teammates encircling and celebrating with him on the sidelines. ""I think that was the key to tonight's victory,"" Mills said of the team's spirits. ""It's probably the first game and first win that everyone felt like it was fun, including the fans. Everyone was involved emotionally (more) than any game this season."" MY MAN Poeltl's big night did not surprise DeRozan, who has played with the 7-footer for his entire career. Poeltl played alongside DeRozan for Toronto in his first two seasons before both were traded to San Antonio in the offseason in a deal that sent Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to the Raptors. ""Jakob's my rookie,"" DeRozan said. ""So, to see Jakob in the position that he is in now, I know what he can do. I've seen it from the start. His whole development, I've seen him working after practice. His growth, everything. Tonight is not a surprise for me at all. That's what I've been seeing him doing and what I expect him to do."" TIP-INS Lakers: James was listed as rookie in the game notes. . Rajon Rondo missed his 10th straight game following right hand surgery, but is nearing a return. Rondo worked out on the court prior to the game with teammates Isaac Bonga, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Ivica Zubac. Spurs: Belinelli became the first player in league history with at least 50 3-pointers for nine different teams. . Pau Gasol, who missed his 17th straight game with left foot soreness, was walking without a boot. There is no timetable for his return. . Bertans has made 200 career 3-pointers.","401071056"
"PHOENIX --  The depleted Phoenix Suns gave the Heat a little resistance before normalcy was restored, and Miami became the latest team to win in the desert. Bam Adebayo scored a career-high 22 points, 20 in the first half, and the Heat opened a six-game trip by handing the Suns their eighth straight loss, 115-98, on Friday night. Justise Winslow added 20 points, including all four of his 3-point tries, and Rodney McGruder scored 14 points for Miami. Goran Dragic, back after missing eight games with a sore right knee, had 11 points and 10 assists. ""It feels good,"" Dragic said. ""I was a little winded but I feel great. I'm satisfied."" The Suns again were without their top two scorers. Devin Booker missed his third straight with left hamstring strain, and T.J. Warren his fifth straight with right ankle soreness. Troy Daniels made 6-of-10 3-pointers for a season-high 18 points for Phoenix. Deandre Ayton had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Rookie De'Anthony Melton, in his first career start, scored all 12 of his points in the third quarter for the Suns, who, at 4-22, have the NBA's worst record. ""After the first quarter, that wasn't the tone we wanted to set for the game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""From there we followed up with a 14-point defensive quarter in the second quarter and some good things in the second half on both sides of the floor."" After scoring fewer than 10 points in the first quarter of each of their previous two games, the Suns shot out to a 36-34 lead after one period against Miami. But coach Igor Kokoskov had a hard time calling it an improved offensive performance, considering his team's 21 turnovers (resulting in 29 Miami points). ""It cost us the game,"" he said. Still, Kokoskov said, ""the energy was much, much better than last night"" in a blowout loss in Portland. Daniels' third 3-pointer of the half gave Phoenix its last lead, 45-43, with 4:53 left in the second quarter. Miami scored the next 11 points in what became a 17-2 run. McGruder's 3-pointer capped the outburst and put the Heat up 60-47. Mikal Bridges' steal and 3-pointer at the buzzer cut the Miami lead to 60-50 at the half. Richardson and McGruder sank 3s in an 8-0 spurt that put the Heat ahead 80-62, and they led 89-73 entering the fourth quarter. Phoenix briefly cut it to 91-79 before an 8-1 surge made it 99-80 with eight minutes left. The Heat led by as many as 22 points after that. ADEBAYO TIME Adebayo, who also grabbed 10 rebounds, got extra playing time with the absence of Hassan Whiteside. ""I feel like I do that every night. I provide energy if he's in or he's out,"" Adebayo said. ""I just had to take care of business. There was just a lot of energy."" Spoelstra said of Adebayo, ""He was all over the place."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami was without Wayne Ellington due to a death in the family and is expected back on Monday. Whiteside remained in Miami for the birth of his first child. ...  Adebayo's previous career high was 19 points at Cleveland on Nov. 28, 2017. ... It was Miami's first road game against a Western Conference team this season. ... The Heat have won 19 of their last 21 against Phoenix. ... Dwyane Wade stuck around and talked to cheering fans, and traded jerseys with Jamal Crawford, after his last game in Phoenix. Wade is retiring after this season and this was the first of his last visits to NBA cities. Suns: In the previous two contests, Phoenix was the first NBA team in the shot-clock era to score fewer than 10 points in the first quarter of consecutive games. ... Daniels hit double figures for the third straight game. ... Phoenix signed G Juwan Evans to a two-way contract. Evans and another G-League player, George King, were active for the Suns Friday.","401071057"
"MILWAUKEE --  Klay Thompson sidestepped two defenders to get an open look, hit a 3 from the wing and then coolly walked toward the baseline to guard the next inbounds pass. The Golden State Warriors taught the Milwaukee Bucks a lesson about hitting 3s and playing D. Thompson and Stephen Curry each scored 20 points and hit 4 of 9 from beyond the arc, and the Warriors wrapped up a five-game trip with a 105-95 victory on Friday night for their third straight win. Andre Iguodala added a season-high 15 points for Golden State, which pulled away in the second half with another hot stretch from the 3-point line. The Warriors went 6 of 9 from beyond the arc in a roughly six-minute period that started with Curry's 3 with 3 minutes left in the third quarter to build an 11-point lead. The Warriors shot 41 percent (19 of 46) from long distance against the Bucks, the league's highest-scoring team. The Bucks were just 7 of 39 (18 percent) from 3-point territory. ""Defense hasn't been that great, so it's good to finally put together a game where we hold an opponent to a not so great 3-point percentage,"" Thompson said. ""That did feel really good, I'm not going to lie."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points and 15 rebounds, while Malcom Brogdon added 15 points. But Milwaukee couldn't keep up with Golden State's barrage, missing too many 3s in spite of scoring 26 points off 18 turnovers. ""They do a lot of things that they do to everybody -- kind of switch, muck it up, make it to where it's not easy ... to get shots against them,"" Bucks coach Mike Budeholzer said. A game of fits and starts typically had the Warriors building a three-possession lead, only for the Bucks to answer and get within a bucket. Curry's 3 late in the third put the Warriors ahead to stay, answering Ersan Ilyasova's bucket capped a 12-2 run that briefly gave the Bucks a 74-72. Golden State cut down on turnovers in the second half while forcing more Milwaukee mistakes and misses. The Warriors avenged a 134-111 loss to Milwaukee in Oakland on Nov. 8. ""This was a game that meant a lot to us,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""We were embarrassed a few weeks ago."" The Warriors led 57-51 at the half, hitting 9 of 20 from 3-point range and getting 18 assists on 22 field goals. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green missed his 11th straight game with a sprained right toe. Coach Steve Kerr said the All Star's progress has been ""fantastic"" on the latter part of the road trip, and that he expected Green to play on Monday against Minnesota. ... Jonas Jerebko added 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting from 3. Bucks: Middleton had a rough start in back in the lineup after missing the win over Detroit on Wednesday for personal reasons. He went scoreless in the first half and missed four shots, going to the bench after picking up his third foul with 6:11 left in the second quarter, but finished with 10 points. GUARDING GIANNIS Antetokounmpo took just 13 shots, about five below his season average. Warriors forward Kevin Durant, who can match Antetokounmpo's length, often tried to stand his ground in the lane against the Bucks star. Other times, Golden State would double team and the Bucks couldn't hit the 3. ""Offensively, we can be better. We didn't move the ball very well,"" Budenholzer said. TAKING CHARGE Iguodala and Jerebko were apparently in a friendly competition about which Warrior could draw the most charges. They were tied at two when Jerebko drew a third, with Antetokounmpo picking up the foul with 7:52 left and the Bucks trailing by none. ""I really wanted to get that one,"" Jerebko said. ""I knew he wanted to get to the basket."" THREE-TEAM TRADE Before the game, the Bucks injured center John Henson and guard Matthew Dellavedova to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade that also involved the Washington Wizards. The Bucks got veteran point guard George Hill and a 2021 second-round draft pick from the Cavaliers, and forward Jason Smith and cash from the Wizards. Milwaukee also sent a future first-round pick and a 2021 second-round pick to Cleveland.","401071058"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic started with a routine 3-pointer from the corner. Then the Dallas rookie skipped back several feet behind the arc to hit one over Houston center Clint Capela, followed by a floater in the lane for a tie. After faking a drive that sent Capela scrambling toward the basket, the 19-year-old Slovenian settled behind the 3-point line one more time, connecting again for the 26th lead change between the Mavericks and Rockets. So much for a rough shooting night. Doncic scored 11 straight points to erase an eight-point deficit late in the fourth quarter and the Mavericks went on to their ninth consecutive home victory, 107-104 over the Rockets on Saturday night. ""It's pretty clear that he's got a flair for the moment,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He's unafraid. You don't see that every day. It's a unique three or four minutes, whatever he put together there."" James Harden shrugged off early foul trouble to score 35 points, but missed all four of his 3-point tries in the fourth quarter. Two of them were during Doncic's flurry, along with Chris Paul missing a pair of free throws before Doncic's tying bucket. ""The first thing I'd like to do different is make my free throws,"" said Paul, who scored 23 points while matching Harden with eight assists. ""I think that's where, honestly, it ticked the game off. We were up two. Throws would have put us up four. They hit some step-backs."" Doncic was 3 of 13, and the Mavericks weren't too far removed from a nearly six-minute scoring drought in the fourth quarter when he made the first 3 with the Mavericks trailing 102-94, the largest Houston lead of the game. ""I wasn't playing great,"" said Doncic, who finished 7 of 17 with all three of his 3-pointers in that final stretch and had seven rebounds. ""My game wasn't good at all. I get confident in the end of games. I would say that I feel comfortable."" Lost in the electrifying stretch by the third overall pick in last spring's draft was center DeAndre Jordan's backdoor bounce pass to rookie second-rounder Jalen Brunson. The two-time NCAA champion from Villanova, making his second career start with Dennis Smith Jr. out because of a sprained right wrist, hit the twisting layup to get the Dallas lead back to three with 24 seconds left and finish off his career high of 14 points. Doncic scored 21 points along with Wesley Matthews, who missed two free throws with a chance to put the game away in the final seconds. Eric Gordon missed a potential tying 3-pointer for Houston at the buzzer less than two weeks after the Rockets lost to the Mavericks by 20 at home. ""I thought we played well,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""I think the good news out of all this is that if we play with that intensity, we're going to win a lot of games. Having said that, Doncic did it to us right toward the end."" TIP-INS Rockets: It was the seventh loss in nine games since a season-best five-game winning streak. ... Clint Capela had 12 points and 13 rebounds for his 18th double-double. ... The Rockets had just four other assists besides the 16 combined from Harden and Paul. ... Harden had his 10th 30-point game of the season. Mavericks: It's the longest home winning streak since Dallas won nine straight in 2011, the year of the franchise's only championship. ... F Maxi Kleber was out with a left big toe sprain. ... Smith sat for the second straight game and third time in seven games because of the wrist issue. ... Dorian Finney-Smith scored 14 points along with Harrison Barnes. HARDEN'S RECOVERY Harden already had 10 points when he picked up his third foul with 4:17 left in the first quarter. He fell for a pump fake from Doncic and reached as the rookie went by him. Doncic sold the contact well and got the call. But Harden didn't foul again until midway through the fourth quarter, finishing 11 of 22 from the field, including 6 of 16 from 3. ALL-AROUND GAME Jordan had his 15th double-double by halftime with 12 points and 10 rebounds. He didn't score in the second half but had both of his steals along with the clutch assist to Brunson, who was 7 of 9 from the field.","401071059"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers are showing their frontcourt is a force to be reckoned with, even without injured All-Star guard Victor Oladipo. Starting forwards Thaddeus Young and Bojan Bogdanovic combined for 38 points Saturday night in a 107-97 victory over the Sacramento Kings, while centers Myles Turner and Domantis Sabonis fortified the interior of Indiana's rising defense. Oladipo missed his 10th straight game. Nonetheless, the Pacers, up to fourth in the Eastern Conference standings at 16-10, are proving they are so much more than just Oladipo. ""We have a lot of weapons on this team,"" Turner said, ""and now everybody is playing with confidence."" Young had a season-high 20 points and nine rebounds, and Bogdanovic added 18 points. Bogdanovic has averaged 19 points over the past two weeks with Oladipo recovering from issues with his right knee. Ranked third in the league on defense, Indiana has also made up for Oladipo's absence by frequently flustering the opposition. Sacramento, a top-10 offense shooting 48 percent from the field this season, was held to 42 percent. Buddy Hield scored 20 points and De'Aaron Fox added 18 points and six assists. Nothing came easy as the Kings' three-game win streak ended. ""One of the lower-scoring games we've had all season,"" Fox said. ""They defended us well, so it was just their defense. They got to us, and we weren't able to make shots. Most of our losses have been high-scoring, where we were still able to put the ball in the basket."" With each squad playing the second of a back-to-back, the game lacked the dizzying pace of the teams' meeting of a week ago which Sacramento won 111-110. This game was just as competitive, however. At least until Indiana, up 73-70 after three quarters, went on a 16-2 run midway through the fourth. Sacramento went scoreless on seven of eight possessions during that stretch, and the Pacers moved ahead 100-85 with 4:14 to go. Hield connected on three 3-pointers in the first quarter. The rest of the Kings' offense in the period came from inside the lane (16 points) or on free throws (six) as they carried a 31-24 lead into the second quarter. After that, Turner and Sabonis stepped up. Turner finished with nine points, 13 rebounds and four blocked shots. Sabonis had 14 points and six rebounds, as well as a crowd-pleasing block that helped the Pacers recover from a 12-point second-quarter hole. With the game tied in the waning seconds of the half, Young rebounded a Sacramento miss and flipped a transition pass to Darren Collison, who pulled up for a wide-open, buzzer-beating jumper that provided Indiana a 54-52 halftime edge. ""Myles is doing a good job over the last five or six games just protecting the paint,"" Collison said. ""It's easier said than done, but when you have a big man like that blocking shots, it changes the whole game."" Sabonis also helped change it. After missing Friday's 112-90 win at Orlando due to illness, Sabonis sparked the Pacers in a three-possession sequence. The 6-foot-10 Sabonis unleashed a rim-rocking, one-handed dunk, blocked a point-blank attempt by Willie Cauley-Stein and then pump-faked his way to a nifty basket over Cauley-Stein, causing the Kings to call time out with their lead trimmed to 38-30. Turner and Sabonis left quite an impression on Sacramento's prized 6-11 rookie Marvin Bagley III. He fouled out for the first time. ""They are great players,"" Bagley said. ""They have a lot of talent, athleticism, and they work together. That's a great team we ran into."" TIP-INS Kings: Starting small forward Iman Shumpert, averaging 9.4 points in 25 minutes per game, sat out for rest. . Fox, the Kings' second-leading scorer, didn't score until 3:28 remained in the first half. Pacers: The win marked Indiana's third straight home victory over Sacramento and fifth in the last six meetings overall. . The Pacers committed 17 turnovers, but outrebounded the Kings 52-43.","401071060"
"ATLANTA --  John Collins was most pleased that Atlanta avenged a blowout loss to Denver. Collins scored a career-high 30 points, and Vince Carter and DeAndre' Bembry came off the bench to fuel a third-quarter rally that helped the Hawks beat the Nuggets 106-98 on Saturday night. Collins thought back to a 138-93 loss to the Nuggets last month. ""It's very important when you're going against a team like that runs almost every offensive set they have through him,"" Collins said. ""It's very important to stay aggressive and make every touch as tough as possible."" Collins added 12 rebounds and five assists and played Denver center Nikola Jokic at least evenly although they were not always matched up. Jokic had 24 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, but in closing a five-game trip with the final four games in the Eastern time zone, the injury-riddled Nuggets ran out of gas and faded while watching a 56-51 halftime lead vanish in Atlanta's 35-21 third quarter. The Hawks (6-20) snapped a four-game losing streak. ""They came out in the third quarter and beat our butts,"" said Denver coach Jeff Malone. ""The third quarter our defense was non-existent. This was one of our worst performances of the year."" Denver (17-9) dropped games on back-to-back nights for the first time all season after sweeping the first three situations. The Nuggets fell 113-107 Friday in Charlotte. Juancho Hernangomez pitched in 17 points and 10 rebounds for Denver. The Nuggets were in charge most the first half, especially in the first quarter as Jokic scored 15 points, but rookie guard Trae Young scored on a driving lineup with 8:28 to go in the third quarter to give the Hawks a 61-60 lead. Atlanta built the margin to 84-72 on a driving layup by Bembry with 58 seconds left in the period. Carter scored 11 of his 13 points in the third, when Bembry added eight of his 18 and the Hawks took a 86-77 lead into the fourth quarter. Atlanta made 13-of-22 shots in the period, including 8-of-12 3-pointers. Atlanta had a 31-23 rebounding edge in the second half, and center Dewayne Dedmon grabbed 11 boards. ""I thought John and Dewayne really set the tone, our two bigs, on the boards,"" said Hawks first-year head coach Lloyd Pierce. ""To control the boards against a team like this really helped us get out and run."" TIP-INS Nuggets: It's not hard to see how they lost. Denver shot just 29.4 percent in the second half while making 15-of-51 shots. . . . Mason Plumlee scored six points off the bench for the Nuggets, but missed the chance to play against his brother Miles, whose sore knee kept him out of action for the Hawks. Hawks: Played without backup G Jeremy Lin (lower back strain) and Fs Taurean Prince (left ankle sprain) and Omari Spellman (right hip). BEAT UP AND BRUISED Denver went without starting forward Paul Millsap for the first time since he fractured his right big toe Friday at Charlotte, and guard Jamal Murray left the game when kicked in an already sore shin. Also, high-scoring guards Will Barton (right hip/core) and Gary Harris (right hip) remained sideline for Denver. MOVING IT AROUND The Hawks had 33 assists, one short of their season high, as forward Kent Bazemore tied his career high with eight dimes. He was more impressed by Collins. ""The future is very bright for John,"" Bazemore said of the second-year forward from Wake Forest who has scored 19, 24, 26 and 30 points in the past four games.","401071061"
"CLEVELAND -- The rookie scored a decisive win over the five-time All-Star in the Cleveland Cavaliers' 116-101 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Collin Sexton, the Cavaliers' first-year point guard, matched a season high with 29 points, while John Wall was held to a career-low one point in Cleveland's easy victory. Wall came into the game averaging 21.3 points, but his only point came on a free throw early in the third quarter with Cleveland holding a 74-48 lead. He missed all five shots and had six assists. Wall, who was taken out late in the third quarter, didn't need to analyze the statistics. ""I didn't have to look at it,"" he said. ""I already knew it without looking at it. First game of my life. One free throw. No field goals."" Wall said he's been dealing with a bone spur in his left heel and received treatment in the locker room following the game. ""I couldn't move,"" he said. ""Couldn't run. Probably shouldn't have played. That's my fault....I've had it for a while."" Sexton matched up against Wall for the second time this season. Wall scored eight points -- his career low before Saturday -- while Sexton had 24 on Nov. 14 ""He didn't have it going tonight, but I know he'd going to get back on track by the next game, for sure,"" Sexton said. Sexton was 13 of 23 from the field and had six assists, including an alley-oop pass to Larry Nance Jr. for a one-handed dunk that brought the crowd to its feet late in the game. ""That was nice,"" Sexton said. ""I saw him cut from the corner and I just had to pick it up with my hand and toss it to him."" Wall returned after missing Washington's victory Wednesday night over Atlanta because of personal reasons. He didn't participate in the shootaround Saturday because he was under the weather. Tristan Thompson had 23 points and 19 rebounds as Cleveland dominated, going ahead for good late in the first quarter and building a 29-point lead in the second half. Bradley Beal scored 27 points, but the Wizards turned in a flat performance after winning three straight. Cleveland (6-20) had only 10 available players because of injuries and Friday's three-team trade with the Wizards and Milwaukee Bucks, but didn't play like a short-handed team. The Cavaliers hit 15 of 31 3-pointers. Rodney Hood missed the game because of a sprained right toe that caused him to sit out the second half Friday against Sacramento. Matthew Dellavedova acquired in Friday's trade, watched from the bench in street clothes. The first quarter had seven lead changes before Cleveland ended the period with an 18-3 run. Jalen Jones, signed to a two-way contract last week, hit a 3-pointer on consecutive possessions and Jordan Clarkson made two 3-pointers, helping Cleveland to a 38-25 lead. TOUGH NIGHT The Wizards were displeased about their effort in the lopsided defeat. ""This game was unacceptable on many fronts,"" Beal said. ""We've got to be disciplined. We didn't come out with the same focus we had the last three games."" ""I'm disappointed that our mindset wasn't right,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""We gave up everything they wanted. We didn't have the right mindset."" NICE BOUNCE BACK The Cavaliers were soundly defeated 129-110 by Sacramento on Friday, but rebounded with a strong performance. ""We had guys that stepped up and played really well,"" coach Larry Drew said. ""It was one of those games that we got into a pretty good rhythm."" TIP-INS Wizards: Former Cavs F Jeff Green scored 17 points and F Otto Porter Jr. added 15. ... F Sam Dekker was sent from Cleveland to Washington in the deal.

"NEW YORK --  Kenny Atkinson and the Brooklyn Nets are feeling a sense of satisfaction. Two wins in 24 hours will do that. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 25 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 20 to lead the Nets to a 112-104 win over the New York Knicks on Saturday night. ""My Sunday will be a heck of a lot better,"" Atkinson said. ""We call it a `Q of L' win. Quality of life win. We feel a little bit better and everything tastes a little better."" Dinwiddie scored 10 of his points in the fourth quarter, Allen Crabbe scored 17 points, Jarrett Allen had 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Joe Harris added 11 as Brooklyn won its second straight game. The Nets improved to 10-18. ""I just love the spirit of this group,"" said Atkinson, whose team had lost eight straight prior to Friday night's 106-105 overtime win over Toronto. ""A great win against Toronto. Beating the Knicks on the road. It's a great job by our guys."" While the Nets were reveling in a win over their crosstown rivals, the Knicks were looking at silver linings. Enes Kanter led the Knicks (8-19) with 23 points and 14 rebounds. Allonzo Trier had 15 points off the bench, Emmanuel Mudiay chipped in with 13 points and Damyean Dotson and Mario Hezonja each added 12 for New York, which has lost three straight and five of six. ""We went out there and fought to the end,"" said Frank Ntilikina. ""We did a good job."" Just not as good a job as the Nets. Brooklyn was coming off an emotional overtime win over Toronto on Friday, while the Knicks hadn't played since Thursday. In this game, it was the Nets who were the better, more in-sync squad. The Nets used crisp passing to create open shots when they were not driving the lane for layups and drawing fouls. Brooklyn made 48.9 percent of its shots from the field (43 for 88) and 50 percent of its 3s (11 for 22). New York, meanwhile, knocked down 47 percent of its shots (39 for 83), but missed 18 of 26 from 3-point range (30.8 percent). Each team shot 60 percent from the free throw line. Brooklyn made 15 of 25 from the line, while the Knicks were 18 for 30. The Nets led by 10 points, 56-46, at halftime and extended their lead to as many as 19 points in the fourth quarter. ""I was searching that whole game for a lineup that could compete defensively and move the ball offensively,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. ""We were in mud for 2 1/2 or 3 quarters of that game."" This season, the Nets haven't show the ability to close out teams, while the Knicks have fought back from deficits. Both happened in the fourth quarter, as the Knicks cut the deficit to five points, 101-96, on a layup by Ntilikina. But on New York's next possession, Dotson missed a driving reverse layup, and on the counterattack Hollis-Jefferson was awarded a basket as Mitchell Robinson was called for defensive goaltending. Immediately after that sequence, Ntilikina missed a 3, and Crabbe countered with a basket from behind the arc that pushed the advantage to 10 points, 106-96. ""All that hard work we were putting in during the (losing) streak is finally paying off,"" Allen said. Still, the Knicks hung in. After Dinwiddie dropped in a layup that extended Brooklyn's lead to 110-98 with 2:16 left, New York scored the next six points and closed within six, 110-104. ""The young guys played well,"" Knicks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said. ""They did a great job of getting us back into the fight and making it a ball game. They didn't stop. They didn't quit. That's the idea Fiz is trying to build here and they showed it."" Dinwiddie's driving dunk following a timeout put the game away. ""Staying locked in and staying focused was something big for us,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. TIP-INS: Nets: During his pregame availability, Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said injured guard Caris LaVert is ""in the gym, shooting,"" but did not offer much else in terms of an update. LaVert has missed 14 straight games with a right foot subtalar dislocation, suffered in the Nets' 120-113 loss to the Timberwolves in Minnesota. ... Allen fouled out with 2:04 left. Knicks: The matchup was the second game at Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Earlier in the day, Seton Hall upset Kentucky, 84-83, in overtime in a men's college basketball game. The hoops-heavy weekend will conclude Sunday with a tripleheader. The Garden will host the annual Holiday Festival which showcases local colleges in two games, then the Knicks will host Charlotte. . After not playing in New York's last three games, Ntilikina got into the game with 3:31 left in the third quarter. Ntilikina finished with seven points in 15 minutes. GROWTH SPURTS: Prior to the game, New York coach David Fizdale and Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson spoke at length about the future for their respective franchises. While the teams have generally been competitive this season, Fizdale and Atkinson talked about player development and this summer's free agent marketplace as being key to the franchises. The Knicks and Nets are in the midst of rebuilding projects, and the franchises are expected to be active in the upcoming free agent market. New York only has $57.3 million allotted to eight players for next season, and Brooklyn has $43.7 million earmarked in player salaries. ""Trying to develop youth,"" Fizdale said. ""And hopefully attract some free agents this summer."" Arguably the biggest difference between the teams is that the Knicks have a foundational piece in injured forward Kristaps Porzingis, the kind of player the Nets do not have. Yet Atkinson was adamant that the Nets should be focused on sustained improvement. Brooklyn won 20 games in his first season, and 28 games last year. He declined to put a numerical value on what would constitute improvement this season. ""I'm not going to pick a number. I know it's better than 28 (wins). I know that I'm not going to start picking numbers, Atkinson said. ""We're looking to take another step forward. How big that jump will be, we'll see at the end of the season.""","401071063"
"CHICAGO -- The Boston Celtics turned in a record-setting performance in their steady climb up the Eastern Conference standings. Jaylen Brown scored 23 points off the bench, Daniel Theis added a career-high 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and the Celtics routed the Chicago Bulls 133-77 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win. The 56-point margin of victory was the largest in franchise history, surpassing a 51-point win (153-102) over the Philadelphia Warriors on March 7, 1962. The winning differential also tied the mark by an NBA road team, set by Seattle in a 136-80 win at Houston on Dec. 6, 1986. The 56-point loss was the worst in Bulls history, eclipsing a 53-point (127-74) defeat at Minnesota on Nov. 8, 2001. The Celtics (15-10) overmatched and sped past the woeful Bulls from the opening tip -- and never let up. ""I thought our guys were really locked in,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""They played hard all the way through."" And ran up some impressive numbers. ""The offense has gotten better over the last couple of weeks,"" Stevens said. ""We just have to keep building on it."" Jayson Tatum had 18 points and Terry Rozier added 15 as the Celtics used a 17-0 start and a balanced attack to roll to their second straight lopsided win after beating New York 128-100 on Thursday. The Celtics have outscored opponents by an average of 126.2 to 97.6 during their five-game run. ""I think since the last five games, we've been moving the ball very well, probably average 30 assists in every game we won,"" Theis said. ""That's the way we should play -- just fast."" It was a different story for the Bulls. ""Disappointing effort, disappointing outcome after what I thought was a really hard-fought two games and at home last night,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""Got to give Boston credit -- I thought they made the shots. ""They kind of punched us and we didn't respond."" Shaquille Harrison came off the bench to score a career-high 20 points for Chicago, which has lost eight of nine. Zach LaVine had 11 for the Bulls (6-21), whose previous worst loss this season was by 39 points (122-83) to Toronto on Nov. 17. ""We all should be [embarrassed],"" LaVine said. The Bulls fell flat after beating Oklahoma City 114-112 on Friday night on Lauri Markkanen's layup in the closing seconds, giving Boylen his first win as an NBA head coach. A longtime NBA assistant, Boylen took over Monday when Fred Hoiberg was fired following a 5-19 start. The Bulls lost at Indiana the following night in Boylen's debut. The Celtics took charge early in this one, racing ahead 17-0 as they shot 8-for-11 from the floor at the start. Boston led 35-17 after one quarter as it shot 60.9 percent, and led 64-43 at the half thanks to 52.4 percent shooting. For the game, the Celtics outshot Chicago 53.8 percent to 38.3 percent. The scoring in Boston's first-half outburst was evenly distributed. Marcus Morris led with 12 points, while Tatum, Theis and Rozier each had 10. The Celtics' biggest lead in the first half was 22 points and Chicago never got closer than 13. Chicago missed its first 12 field goal attempts, prompting Boylen to pull all five starters 4:45 in. The Bulls didn't score until Jabari Parker hit a pair of free throws 6:18 in -- raising a derisive cheer from the United Center crowd. Chicago didn't get its first basket until Robin Lopez sank a turnaround hook 36 seconds later. The Celtics kept the pressure on, outscoring Chicago 69-34 in the second half. TIP-INS Celtics: Forward/center Al Horford missed the game with a sore left knee after recording 19 points and 12 rebounds against New York on Thursday. ... Forward/center Aron Baynes (sprained left ankle) also sat out. He limped off the court late in the last two minutes of the first quarter versus the Knicks. ... Forward Guerschon Yabusele had to be helped off the court midway through the fourth quarter after landing awkwardly. Stevens said Yabusele suffered a ""bad sprain."" Bulls: Boylen still isn't sure when guard Kris Dunn (sprained left MCL) and forward Bobby Portis (sprained right MCL) will return. ""Long-term health is what we're about,"" Boylen said. ""We expect them back soon, any day, but not today. We'll re-evaluate tomorrow."" ... A longtime NBA assistant, Boylen said he's very close to Hoiberg and said feelings are still ""really raw"" following the firing of his former boss. Boylen shook off questions about whether Hoiberg ""lost the locker room."" ""I approach the locker room different than Fred,"" Boylen said. ""It doesn't mean better, worse or whatever. We're different people."" BY THE NUMBERS The Celtics have scored at least 115 points in every game during their five-game winning streak, their longest such run since doing it six consecutive times in March 1988. GOT MILK? Boylen said he celebrated his first victory as an NBA head coach on Friday night at home with his family. ""We had a bowl of cereal with my kids and watched the 'Family Feud,'"" he said.","401071064"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers weren't about to let fatigue get the better of them on the second night of a back-to-back. The Lakers recovered from a loss Friday night in San Antonio to dominate Memphis, defeating the Grizzlies 111-88 on Saturday, led by 20 points each from James and Kyle Kuzma. James added nine assists and eight rebounds, while Kuzma had nine rebounds, six assists and a couple of blocks. ""At the end of the day, we're professionals. We come out, our job is to bring energy regardless of playing back-to-backs or 40 minutes or whatever,"" said Kuzma, who was among four Lakers starters who played at least 36 minutes in the 133-120 loss to the Spurs. ""You forget about (the loss) and move on,"" James said, adding, ""You can't let that harp on us, even though we played three great quarters (against San Antonio). You have to get ready, and that's what we did."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Josh Hart added 16 points apiece, while JaVale McGee finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Wayne Selden led Memphis with 17 points. Mike Conley added 12 points while struggling from the field, shooting 4 of 12 on the night, as Memphis shot 41 percent overall. Memphis was coming off a win over the Pelicans in New Orleans on Friday. ""We just didn't have it,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Early on, we got a little demoralized because we got some open looks, especially in that first quarter. ... From that point forward, we just couldn't dig out of that hole."" By halftime, the Lakers led 63-40 and were holding Memphis to 43 percent shooting and 26 percent from beyond the arc. Los Angeles' dominance was particularly evident on the boards where it had a 36-11 advantage. Not only did the Lakers have more offensive rebounds (14) than Memphis' total, Tyson Chandler was one shy of matching the Grizzlies with 10 of his own in the half. Los Angeles expanded the lead to 29 in the third quarter. By the midway point of the fourth, Bickerstaff emptied the bench. Like the Lakers, Memphis players said they simply have to forget about the lopsided loss. ""We've got to bounce back,"" reserve forward JaMychal Green said. ""We can't play like this ever again this season. We had enough of those games last season"" when Memphis finished 22-60. TIP-INS Lakers: F Brandon Ingram missed his second game with a sprained left ankle. ... Tyson Chandler finished with 14 rebounds. ... The Lakers out-rebounded Memphis 57-36. The Lakers' 19 offensive rebounds were a season high for a Memphis opponent. That led to 20 second-chance points. Grizzlies: Marc Gasol and Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 11 points each. ... The 88 points was just over Memphis' season low of 83 on opening night against Indiana. ... D.J. Stephens, a two-way player, scored his first points of the season on a dunk in the fourth quarter. ... Selden's 17 points marked the first time he has led the team in scoring this season. TIME ADJUSTMENT Because the Lakers' starters played extended minutes against San Antonio and the team arrived in Memphis in the middle of the night, coach Luke Walton said before the game he was considering a variety of rotations to conserve his team's energy. In the end, James played almost 32 minutes, Kuzma played 34 and Hart played just less than 36 minutes.","401071065"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard was waiting all night for just the right moment. Lillard and CJ McCollum each hit 3-pointers in the final minute to give the Portland Trail Blazers a 113-105 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night. Lillard had been looking for enough space to put a clear shot up and he finally found it with 58.5 seconds left. ""It was one of the first (looks) where the big wasn't there, so I thought, `I'm taking this,' and it went in,"" Lillard said. Lillard finished with 28 points and eight assists, while McCollum added 19 points. Jusuf Nurkic matched his season-high with 22 points and 11 rebounds. It was a close game for most of the night. Jeff Teague's 3-pointer and a pair of Minnesota free throws put the Timberwolves up 102-96 with just under four minutes to go. McCollum's 3-pointer pulled Portland within 102-101 and the Blazers took the lead on Lillard's long jumper, but Karl-Anthony Towns hit a 3-pointer that put Minnesota back in front. Lillard buried another 3-pointer with 58 seconds left to give Portland a 108-105 lead. McCollum added his 3 with 24.9 seconds to go and Minnesota couldn't catch up. Lillard passed to McCollum for the clutch 3. ""I just saw CJ go out the other side by himself and nobody was near him, and I was like, `That's as good a shot as you're gonna get,' and he knocked it down,"" Lillard said. Andrew Wiggins had 22 points for Minnesota, which had won two straight and six of its last seven games. All five of the Timberwolves' starters were in double figures. ""Going down the stretch you've got to play tough and we didn't do that,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We didn't do what we're supposed to do."" McCollum returned for the Blazers after missing the last game with a left ankle sprain. The Blazers won at home Thursday night against the struggling Phoenix Suns, who were without their two best players. The win snapped a three-game losing streak. The Timberwolves were coming off a 112-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. Townes had 35 points and 12 rebounds. The two teams kept it close in the first half. Jake Layman's dunk gave Portland a 34-27 lead early in the second quarter, but the Timberwolves kept the margin within single digits. Portland led by a slim 53-51 at the half, led by Nurkic with 14 points and eight rebounds. The Blazers outrebounded Minnesota 33-19 in the opening half, but they were hurt by 13 turnovers. Portland finished with 19 turnovers. Lillard's 3-pointer and McCollum's basket gave Portland a 66-57 lead early in the third quarter. The Blazers pushed the lead to as many as 10 points but the Timberwolves closed the gap again to 79-78 on Dario Saric's 3-pointer and went ahead on Towns' basket before the end of the period. Towns finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. ""It was good to hit a couple of timely 3s after struggling most of the night with shooting, so that was a definite positive,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""I thought we played pretty solid defense for the entire night which kind of kept us in it. "" It was the third of four meetings between the two teams after splitting the first two. TIP INS Timberwolves: Started the season 0-8 on the road, but they won their last two going into Saturday's game. They went into the game 0-7 against the Western Conference. ... It was the start of a four-game trip. ... Andrew Wiggins passed Wally Sczcerbiak (6,775 points) for fourth place on the Timberwolves' all-time scoring list. Trail Blazers: Portland has won six straight home games against the Timberwolves. ... A highlight was Nik Stauskas' behind-the-back no-look pass to Jake Layman that made it 89-86 for Portland in the fourth. NURK'S LINE: In addition to his 22 points and 11 rebounds, Nurkic added four assists, three steals and four blocks. The Blazers said he was the first player in the league this season to hit all of those marks in a single game. QUOTABLE: ""We let the game slip. I mean it's that simple. All the guys that got good shots took them and when they don't make them that's something you can deal with but on defensive side we've just got to make it a little bit harder on their players,"" said Derrick Rose, who finished with 18 points and nine assists.","401071066"
"LOS ANGELES --  Dwyane Wade showed he still has his scoring touch. Wade scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game, leading the Miami Heat to a 121-98 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. The veteran guard was 8 for 21 from the field and 5 for 10 from 3-point range en route to his second-highest scoring total of the season. It came nearly two weeks after he had a season-high 35 points at Toronto on Nov. 25, and one day after he had two points in a win over Phoenix. ""Every time I get an opportunity to so something like this, obviously its's great and special, but I just want to help this young team win,"" Wade said. ""When we get wins like this, wins in four of our last five, we're getting better."" Wade, who is retiring after this season, will play his final regular-season game in Los Angeles on Monday against the Los Angeles Lakers. ""He's still Dwyane Wade,"" the Clippers' Lou Williams said. ""Kobe (Bryant) had 60 points in his last game. Those guys have superpowers bro. Every once in a while, you like to see it on TV. You hate that it's (on) you sometimes."" The Heat were down to eight players on the second night of back-to-back games on the road, but still had plenty to beat the Clippers, who would have moved into sole possession of the top spot in the Western Conference with a victory. Justise Winslow scored 21 points and James Johnson added 18 points for the Heat, while Kelly Olynyk added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Derrick Jones Jr. had 11 rebounds. Miami was without guard Josh Richardson, who was a late scratch because of a shoulder impingement. They also lost guard Tyler Johnson early in the first with a left hip contusion. Johnson had scored eight points in the opening five minutes. Goran Dragic was out because of rest. The Heat finished strong despite playing Friday night at Phoenix when they defeated the Suns. Miami has won four of its past five games and is 2-0 to start a season-high six-game road trip. ""When they show up for shootaround, you find out more guys aren't playing, but (these) guys look forward to the challenge instead of trying to make an excuse and get on to the next game,"" Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Heat held a 91-90 lead late after three quarters before using a big fourth to pull away. From late in the third until just over three minutes remained, the Heat went on a 25-2 run to take control. Clippers coach Doc Rivers was given two technical fouls in the midst of the Heat's run, getting tossed by official Ray Acosta with 7:17 to play. ""I've been in the league a long time; I was saying the call was awful,"" Rivers said. ""I don't know how you get a technical foul when the official is on the other side of the floor. But listen, we played poorly. (My technical) wasn't why we lost the game. We didn't play very well."" Tobias Harris scored 20 points and Williams added 18 for the Clippers, who were just 7 of 29 from 3-point range and 33 for 89 from the field. Danilo Gallinari had 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, who saw their NBA-best nine-game home win streak end. The Clippers entered having won 10 of their past 13 games. TIP-INS Heat: Along with outscoring the Clippers 30-8 in the final quarter, the Heat outrebounded the Clippers 19-7 in the fourth. ... Wade was 4 for 7 from 3-point range in the opening two quarters, tying his career high for made 3s before halftime. Clippers: The Clippers made just two field goals in the fourth quarter and went 1 of 7 from 3-point range. ... The eight-point fourth quarter was their lowest scoring quarter since March 2003. ... The Clippers never led in their first home game in 10 days after going 2-2 on a four-game road trip. ... Luc Mbah a Moute, who has not played since Oct. 23 because of a knee injury, is likely two weeks away from playing according to Rivers. ZONED IN The Heat dusted off a zone defense to get the Clippers out of sorts and it worked in turning a close game into a rout. But the results from the zone were actually a pleasant surprise. The Heat went to the floor-spacing defense primarily to preserve its energy. ""I think at first it was to rest guys or to preserve energy and eventually we saw they were struggling with it,"" Winslow said. ""We just kept going back to it. It was great. It killed two birds with one stone. Coming into the game, we really didn't know who was going to play and who wasn't going to play, but we always say, `It's all we got. It's all we need.""","401071067"
"DETROIT --  Alvin Gentry knew he needed Anthony Davis. The New Orleans Pelicans coach didn't get his star at 100 percent. It was still enough. Davis left with a right hip injury after a first-quarter collision with Detroit Pistons star Blake Griffin and missed the rest of the first half. When he came back early in the third quarter, he was moving slowly and only scored three points, matching the three he had before the injury. However, he also had five blocks and nine rebounds against Griffin and Andre Drummond to help the Pelicans win 116-108. ""Just having Anthony on the floor means everything,"" Gentry said. ""He might have been closer to 50 percent than 100 percent, but he was still giving us great defense and grabbing big rebounds."" With Davis missing or ineffective on the offensive end, Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle took over. Holiday scored 37 points on 14-of-22 shooting and Randle added 28 points, six rebounds and five assists. ""We just executed our game plan,"" Randle said. ""Everything was coming extremely easily for Jrue and when he gets rolling, he doesn't miss."" Griffin scored 35 points for Detroit, Andre Drummond had 23 points and 19 rebounds, and Langston Galloway added a season-best 24. ""Even when Anthony is out, that's a very solid team with a lot of weapons,"" Griffin said. ""We knew how we wanted to handle Jrue, but we didn't execute."" The Pistons have lost four straight. ""Jrue Holiday was a really tough challenge for Bruce (Brown) to handle by himself, and even when we sent Reggie (Jackson) over to help, he still had his way with us,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We are getting great looks on the other end, but we've got to knock them down."" Drummond had 10 offensive rebounds for the 22nd time in his career -- Tyson Chandler is second among active players with 15 -- but Gentry thought his defense did just enough against Detroit's center. ""You can block him out on every shot, and he's just going to go over you and get rebounds,"" Gentry said. ""I thought we got the big rebounds we needed down the stretch."" Holiday had 18 points in the first half, and New Orleans led by 11 before the Pistons cut it to 56-50. Davis returned at the first stoppage in the third quarter and helped the Pelicans take a 78-62 lead midway through the period. He was clearly limited on the offensive end but was able to get stops on defense. Griffin and Galloway combined for 26 points in the period and had the Pistons within four points until Tim Frazier's buzzer-beating 3-pointer made it 91-84 going to the fourth. ""We were getting a lot of stops late in the quarter, and that lets me get into transition and get my shots,"" Galloway said. ""We just needed to keep that going."" Detroit quickly narrowed the gap to 93-91, but the Pelicans responded with a 7-1 run to take an eight-point lead. ""I think we lead the NBA in wide-open shots, but we have to start knocking them down,"" Griffin said. Drummond missed two free throws with 4:03 left, then fouled Randle at the other end. He hit both shots to make it 107-98, and the Pelicans held on to win. TIP INS Pelicans: New Orleans has won 16 of its last 20 against Detroit, including 12 of the last 13. ... Gentry, who coached the Pistons from 1997-2000, is 16-5 against them as a head coach. Pistons: Galloway has hit at least four 3-pointers six times in the last 15 games. .. Reggie Jackson missed his first five shots and didn't score until 4:26 remained in the game. DAVIS IN BOSTON? Davis went for more medical tests after the game, and Gentry wasn't sure if he would play Monday in Boston. ""A lot of times, it is the next day that these really hurt,"" he said. ""We're not even 30 games into the season, and we're going to be very cautious with this. If he's ready, he'll play, but only if he's ready.""","401071068"
"TORONTO --  After playing a starring role down the stretch, Malcolm Brogdon called this Milwaukee's best performance of the season. Brogdon hit tying and go-ahead 3-pointers in the final 67 seconds and the Bucks held on to beat Toronto Raptors 104-99 on Sunday night. Brogdon scored eight of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, Giannis Antetokounmpo had 19 points and matched a season high with 19 rebounds, and Brook Lopez had 19 points for the Bucks, the first team to beat Toronto twice this season. ""In terms of having a full game, playing hard on both ends and executing at a high level on both ends, executing the game plan, and then finishing strong down the stretch, that is definitely the top game for us,"" Brogdon said. The Bucks (17-8) bounced back from Friday's loss to Golden State and have yet to lose consecutive games this season. ""That's how special this team is,"" Antetokounmpo said. Serge Ibaka scored 22 points and Kawhi Leonard had 20 for the Raptors, who have lost two straight, the second time this season they've suffered consecutive defeats. Toronto, which lost 106-105 at Brooklyn on Friday, dropped three straight from Nov. 12 to 16, losing at home to New Orleans and Detroit before an overtime defeat at Boston. Fred VanVleet scored a season-high 19 points and Pascal Siakam had 17 for the Raptors, whose 21-7 record is best in the NBA. Neither Leonard (rest) nor Antetokounmpo (concussion protocol) played when the Raptors lost 124-109 at Milwaukee on Oct. 29, Toronto's first defeat following a 6-0 start. Toronto's Kyle Lowry shot 0 for 5 and didn't score for the first time since March 17, 2013 against Miami. Lowry led the Raptors with seven assists. ""Just couldn't find the open ones tonight,"" Lowry said. All of his misses Sunday were from 3-point range. Milwaukee led 79-74 heading to the fourth and pushed its lead to 85-74. Toronto battled back to lead 97-94 on a 3 by Leonard at 2:07, but Brogdon hit the tying 3 at 1:07 and followed with a go-ahead jumper with 40 seconds left. ""We did a great job trusting one another and moving the ball,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Malcolm hit some huge shots."" Middleton assisted on both of Brogdon's key baskets and finished with five assists. ""I'm going to get the glory for the shots but Khris is the one who sacrificed and made the extra pass to get it to me,"" Brogdon said. VanVleet answered with a layup, but Antetokounmpo restored the 3-point cushion with a driving dunk. Leonard hit the rim with a potential tying 3 and Ersan Ilyasova was fouled as he grabbed the rebound. Ilyasova sealed it by making both free throws with seven seconds remaining, and Toronto did not attempt another shot. Milwaukee led 51-49 at halftime. TIP-INS Bucks: Newly acquired G George Hill and C Jason Smith were active but did not play. ... Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with six assists. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs are starting to feel better about their play, which is a welcome sign for the former defensive stalwarts following a series of blowout losses. DeMar DeRozan had 26 points and eight assists and Rudy Gay added 23 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Spurs to a 110-97 victory over the Utah Jazz on Sunday night. Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points for Utah, which had its two-game winning streak snapped. LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for San Antonio, which won its second straight after dropping four of five. ""It's a marathon,"" Aldridge said. ""You can't get too high, can't get too low, can't get caught up in one loss (or) one win. You know we've had great games where we've played the right way and had good wins. And we've had games where we laid an egg out there. So, you have to enjoy it, learn from it, and just stay hungry."" The ""Spurs Way"" was a model of consistency and continuity for two decades, but now San Antonio is simply trying to find its way two months into the season after a tumultuous offseason. The Spurs lost franchise cornerstones Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker to retirement and free agency, respectively, traded Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto and lost Kyle Anderson to Memphis as a free agent. The fallout from the offseason turnover has been most evident defensively. The Spurs had lost by more than 30 points only five times in coach Gregg Popovich's first 1,758 regular-season contests, but it happened three times in a recent four-game stretch. The dubious run ended with a 139-105 loss at Utah on Dec. 4, which made Sunday's victory over the Jazz even more meaningful. ""I think it's just the beginning of what we can be,"" said Gay, who tied his career high in rebounds. ""People forget we're still learning. We're trusting each other and we're continuing to be a pretty good defensive team."" Mitchell was held scoreless in the first half as San Antonio raced to a 54-36 lead while holding Utah to 36 percent shooting. ""Sometimes when your offense, you're not executing, it just hurts your defense,"" Mitchell said. ""That's what we put our staple on, defensively, and being able to execute out of our defense."" The Spurs held the Jazz to 18 points in the first and second quarter and set a season low for points allowed by an opponent in the first half. ""The last couple of games we looked better at the defensive end,"" Popovich said. ""More communication, a little more understanding. Guys get used to playing with each other and understanding what the process is for the way we want to play. I think it's sinking in, so we'll see if it continues."" Ricky Rubio added 26 for the Jazz and Rudy Gobert was the only other player in double figures, with 12 points. MOMMA'S NOT HAPPY DeRozan has been thrilled playing for Popovich following an offseason trade, but it's causing some family tension. ""It's crazy,"" DeRozan said smiling. ""I got cussed out by my mom this morning because she's been dying to meet Pop. She told me today I better make sure she gets to meet him. So, to have that excitement from my mom, being able to play for a guy like Pop, that's respected the way he is, it's definitely an honor."" ON THE BALL Gay has five double-doubles this season through 23 games. His career high is eight in 2016. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell missed all six of his shot attempts in going scoreless in the first half. . Every Utah player was healthy and available with the exception of the three players in the G League. Spurs: Popovich tied Pat Riley for fourth all-time in league history with 1,210 career victories. . Davis Bertans missed the game due to an undisclosed personal reason. . Dante Cunningham also missed the game, sitting out due to abdominal soreness. .. The Spurs' previous low points by an opponent in the first half was 39 points, which happened twice.","401071070"
"NEW YORK --  The Charlotte Hornets got off to a strong start and cruised to an easy win. Kemba Walker scored 25 points and Jeremy Lamb added 19 as Charlotte beat the New York Knicks 119-107 on Sunday night in a game it never trailed. Tony Parker scored 16 points, Marvin Williams had 13 and Cody Zeller finished with 12 as the Hornets led by as many as 28 points. ""We knew they played last night. We wanted to come out really aggressive on both ends of the floor and it worked out for us,"" Walker said. ""We wanted to jump on them. We really needed this win."" Knicks rookie Kevin Knox tied a season high with 26 points and set a career high with 15 rebounds, while Tim Hardaway Jr. added 21 points. ""I just wanted to make sure I gave everything I had in the tank, leave it all out on the floor,"" Knox said. Lamb's layup with 8:50 left in the third quarter gave the Hornets their biggest lead at 77-49. New York pulled within 18 on Knox's 3-pointer before Walker's long 3 pushed the lead to 99-78 heading to the fourth. The Knicks opened the fourth with a 7-0 run to pull within 14 on Frank Ntilikina's jumper with 10:47 remaining. However, the Hornets scored the next 12 points to put the game out of reach. ""Once we settled into the game, the ball was moving, shots were going down, we were getting stops,"" said Hornets coach James Borrego. During that run, Ntilikina, who finished with 18 points -- all in the second half -- fouled out running into Parker with nine minutes left and Knicks coach David Fizdale was accessed two technical fouls and ejected with 8:33 remaining. ""It was a little frustrating,"" Ntilikina said. ""He (Parker) is one of the guards I respect in this league. I've been watching him since I was young."" Zeller scored 10 points in the first quarter as the Hornets opened up a pair of seven-point leads. Parker came off the bench to score eight and Charlotte led 27-24 after the first 12 minutes. ""I wanted to come out with a lot of energy to start with,"" Zeller said. ""Throughout the season we've come out slow for a few games. I took it upon myself to come out with a lot of energy."" The Hornets opened the second quarter on a 7-0 run, but the Knicks responded by scoring the next six points to pull to 34-30. Charlotte followed with an 18-4 stretch to take an 18-point lead. New York closed within 10 by scoring the next eight points, but the Hornets went on to lead 61-47 at halftime. Damyean Dotson added 12 points for the Knicks, who have lost four straight. TIP-INS Hornets: Three Charlotte players (Walker, Nicolas Batum, Jeremy Lamb) have started all of their 26 games this season, while two others (Marvin Williams, Cody Zeller) have started 25. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Willy Hernangomez have each started once. Knicks: New York had defeated Charlotte four consecutive times at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks hadn't been beaten by the Hornets at home since April 6, 2016. ... Allonzo Trier, who strained his left hamstring in Saturday's loss to Brooklyn, did not play. BALANCING ACT The Hornets have not been more than one game above .500 or more than two games below .500 all season long. Their longest winning streak is two games (five occasions) and they have one three-game losing streak (Nov. 30-Dec. 5). KNICKS' ACHING BACK The Knicks have now played six back-to-back sets this season. They are 1-11 in those games, with their only victory coming at Boston, 117-109 on Nov. 21. BRIEF LAYOVER The Hornets begin a five-game homestand on Wednesday when they host the Pistons, and end it when they play Detroit again on Dec. 21. It is part of a stretch in which Charlotte plays 10 of 12 games on its home floor, with the only away games having taken place in Minnesota (Wednesday) and New York.","401071071"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Myles Turner held his ground Monday night. And with one quick swat of the basketball, he saved the Indiana Pacers. The young center scored a season-high 26 points, made two 3-pointers, grabbed 12 rebounds and blocked Kelly Oubre Jr.'s driving layup with 4:16 left to help the Pacers steady themselves long enough to hold on for a 109-101 victory after Washington nearly erased a 25-point second-half deficit. ""Myles did a hell of a job controlling the paint for us and he altered a lot of shots,"" Thaddeus Young said after finishing with 14 points and 12 rebounds. ""We need to thank him tonight, he's our hero."" It will go down as the best all-around game of Turner's four-year career. He was 11 of 16 from the field and finished with five blocks -- three on successive Wizards' possessions that helped Indiana take control late in the first half. The last one prevented Washington from taking its first lead since the second quarter. After the block, Darren Collison made a 3-pointer to give Indiana a four-point cushion, and Washington never got another shot to take the lead. Collison finished with 10 points and 17 assists, his highest single-game total with Indiana. Bojan Bogdanovic added 22 points as Indiana extended its season-best winning streak to four. ""We could not get a key shot to fall during that last stretch,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We competed, we just came up short."" Bradley Beal scored 30 points and Oubre had a season-high 23 for the Wizards, who played without injured All-Star John Wall. Beal certainly tried to make up for Wall's absence after Indiana built a seemingly safe 87-62 lead with 4:05 left in the third. He scored five of the first nine points in a 13-0 run to close out the quarter and his steal to open the fourth helped the Wizards run off the first six points of the fourth to make it 87-81. Beal's two free throws with 4:45 left capped an 8-0 run, and after an offensive foul on Tyreke Evans gave the ball back to the Wizards, Oubre drove into the lane where he was met by Turner who redirected the shot -- and the game. ""At the end of last year, they said `the offense is going to come but we need you to be the best defensive player in the NBA,"" Turner said. ""I really took that to heart and worked my butt off this summer and whipped myself into shape to be able to do so."" TIP-INS Wizards: Beal scored 19 points in the second half and reached the 20-point mark for the 20th time this season. ... Otto Porter Jr. left midway through the first quarter with a bruised knee and did not return. ... Thomas Bryant, who attended Indiana University, had 10 points. Pacers: Turner has recorded double-doubles in four of the last six games. ... Bogdanovic topped the 20-point mark for the eighth time in 14 games. ... Collison had 31 assists without a turnover over a three-game stretch before committing three turnovers in the final six minutes. WALL OUT Two days after scoring a career-low one point at Cleveland, Wall sat out with bone spurs in his left heel. It's not clear when he'll be back. Before the game, coach Scott Brooks said Wall felt better Monday than Sunday and went through his normal pregame routine. ""He ran pretty well,"" Brooks said. ""But we still have a few more days before we have to make our next decision."" ON THE MEND? Indiana guard Victor Oladipo missed his 11th consecutive game with a sore right knee, but he also may be returning soon. Coach Nate McMillan said the All-Star participated in four-on-four drills Monday and could practice Tuesday. ""It's possible,"" McMillan said. ""Things are getting better."" Indiana is 7-4 without Oladipo. Last season, he the Pacers were 0-6 without their top player.","401071072"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid hasn't been feeling like himself for a while and felt sick a day earlier. Nothing like playing the Pistons to help him snap out of it. Embiid scored 24 points in his return to the lineup after a one-game absence, Ben Simmons and Furkan Korkmaz added 18 points apiece, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat Detroit for the second time in four days, winning 116-102 on Monday night. Embiid was given the night off to rest at Detroit on Friday after the 7-foot-2 star grew frustrated with his role following three straight sub-20-point performances. Embiid, though, has had little trouble against the Pistons, now averaging 32 points in three contests this season. ""I love everybody, love my teammates, love the coaching staff -- I think everyone that knows me knows that,"" said Embiid, wearing a ""Process"" sweatshirt to the postgame press conference. ""Me being frustrated is because I hold myself to a really high standard."" Jimmy Butler, who had 38 points to lead Philadelphia to a 117-111 victory in Detroit on Friday, exited in the first half with a strained groin and did not return. Embiid helped make up for that major absence, improving as the game went on after saying he felt ""rusty"" early in the contest. Sixers coach Brett Brown even said he thought his prized big man may miss a second straight game because he wasn't feeling well -- ailments Embiid later revealed to be a ""migraine and diarrhea."" ""You can see how important he is to us, especially when Jimmy goes out,"" Brown said. ""Some of the plays he made late and his spirit was just exceptional tonight. . He started playing with more of a bounce, more tenaciousness as the game unfolded."" Luke Kennard finished with a career-high 28 points on 5-for-8 3-point shooting and Andre Drummond had 21 points and 17 rebounds for the slumping Pistons (13-12), who have dropped five straight after five consecutive wins. Detroit was missing Blake Griffin, 10th in the NBA in scoring. Griffin, who had 50, 38 and 31 points against the Sixers this season, was rested after Detroit hosted New Orleans the previous night. ""(Kennard's) 3-point shooting was very positive, and we're trying to get every bit of positive we can out of this stretch,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""This has been the stretch from hell. But it's going to make us a better team, closer together, tougher hopefully."" Highlighted by a couple of Simmons' dunks, the Sixers scored 38 points in opening quarter and led by as many as 15 in the first half. The Pistons pulled within five early in the fourth quarter before an emphatic dunk by Embiid and Simmons' three-point play helped Philly pull away for its 10th win in the last 12 games. ""I just don't think they were ready for me,"" Simmons said. ""Every game in front of the Pistons, I felt like certain matchups I can take over, get to the rim and do my thing."" TIP-INS Pistons: Besides Griffin, Stanley Johnson (knee), Reggie Bullock (ankle) and Ish Smith (groin) were also out. ... Unless they meet in the playoffs, Detroit is done with Philadelphia this season. They've already met four times over the first two months of the season, with the Sixers winning three. ... Glenn Robinson III left with a sprained ankle. He'll have an MRI on Tuesday. 76ers: Simmons scored his 400th point of the season during an 11-point first quarter, becoming the first player in the NBA with at least 400 points, 200 rebounds and 200 assists. ... The Sixers have scored at least 100 points in 17 straight games, their longest streak since 1990. . At 14-1, the Sixers are off to their best start at home since the 1966-67 season. BIG-TIME BENCH The Pistons got 54 points from their bench, with four reserves hitting for double figures and combining for 11 3-pointers. T.J. McConnell had 14 points and six assists but no one off the bench was as good as Korkmaz, who was named the team's player of the game after a career-high scoring output. ""He's not intimidated by NBA basketball,"" Brown said. ""He's not intimidated by the moment."" NO HOOPLA Embiid and Drummond have been embroiled in a trash-talking rivalry over the past two seasons but Casey was proud his big man stayed away from it Monday. ""He didn't get caught up in all the hoopla,"" the Pistons coach said. ""He played his game. That's something that's part of his growth process.""","401071073"
"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving's shoulder wasn't sore enough to keep him from cheering for Marcus Morris Sr. when he hit three 3-pointers to start the second half and propel Boston to a double-digit lead. Al Horford's injured knee didn't keep him from leaping to his feet when Jayson Tatum drove past Anthony Davis for a dunk. With four of their regulars relegated to cheerleaders, the Celtics got a season-high 31 points from Morris and another 21 from Tatum to beat New Orleans 113-100 on Monday night for their sixth straight victory. ""The first thing was be a leader,"" Morris said. ""We had a lot of guys down ... and keep trying to play the right way with the guys out there."" Anthony Davis scored 41 points and Julius Randle had 20 points and 11 rebounds for New Orleans, which was playing back-to-back games after beating the Pistons in Detroit on Sunday. But Davis also had two shots blocked by Celtics rookie Robert Williams III. ""He had 41,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I think everybody has gotten their shot blocked at one time or another."" Jaylen Brown scored 19 for Boston, which was also without Gordon Hayward and Aron Baynes. Williams, in the longest appearance of his career, had career highs of seven points and 11 rebounds, while picking up three blocked shots -- two on Davis. ""Well, he held him to 41,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens joked. ""I thought Robert did a lot of good things. When you're shooting jumpers and Robert's in the vicinity, you feel him."" The Celtics scored nine straight points in the last four minutes of the first quarter to take a lead they would never relinquish. They led 59-53 at the half before Morris hit three 3s -- one from the left corner, one from the right wing and one from the top of the key -- to make it 68-55. New Orleans never got closer than nine points after that. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis had been questionable with a right hip contusion, but he played 38 minutes. ...  Lost 124-107 in the only other meeting this season, on Nov. 26, and have now lost seven of their last 10 against Boston. ... Fell to 4-11 on the road. Celtics: Were coming off the most lopsided victory in franchise history, a 56-point win over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday. ... Missed eight of their first nine 3-point attempts. After Morris hit three 3s to start the second half, they missed 11 in a row. ROOKIE NIGHT Williams had appeared in just nine box scores this season, never playing more than 8 minutes, 37 seconds. His previous highs were four points and three rebounds; he also matched his best with three blocked shots. How did he feel about guarding Davis? ""I definitely watched the highlights, even when he was at Kentucky. I was a big fan,"" he said. ""It was a great assignment."" Brad Wanamaker, who spent six seasons in Europe and one in the developmental league, matched his career high with four points. He had played in only eight games before Monday and topped his career highs with 18 minutes (old high 9:06), three rebounds (1), and matched his best of four assists. OUT Horford was nursing a sore left knee, Irving had a sore right shoulder, Hayward was ill and Baynes was out with a sprained ankle. The four players combine to average more than 50 points, 21 rebounds and 14 assists this season. TAKING TURNS The Pelicans have alternated wins and losses over their last eight games. ""Win one, lose one, win one, lose one for the past eight,"" Davis said. ""So we've got to put a string of wins together.""","401071074"
"CHICAGO --  De'Aaron Fox put together another impressive offensive display on Monday night. And all he wanted to talk about was defense. Fox scored 23 of his 25 points in the second half, helping the Sacramento Kings rally for a 108-89 victory over the lowly Chicago Bulls. The speedy Fox went 8 for 11 from the field after missing each of his first five shots in the first half. Bogdan Bogdanovic and Marvin Bagley III added 16 points apiece as Sacramento closed out a 3-1 road trip. Fox said two steals he made in the third quarter were a big part of Sacramento's turnaround. ""That's what started me,"" the second-year guard said. ""After those two steals, the whole momentum of the game just changed. After that, we never looked back."" Kings coach Dave Joerger agreed. ""What he did from the first half to the second half was awesome,"" Joerger said. ""He really was a leader out there not just scoring the basketball, but he picked up his defensive pressure."" Chicago led by as many as 14 in its ninth loss in 10 games. The Bulls were coming off a franchise-record 133-77 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 19 points, and Lauri Markkanen had 13. ""We got stung in the third quarter,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""I thought their energy went up and our energy went down as the game went on. That's something we talked in there as a team, and that's something we need to fix."" After falling behind 17-0 on Saturday, the Bulls got off to a better start in this one. They led 33-26 at the end of the first quarter and 56-45 at halftime. Chicago had a 66-57 lead in the third before Sacramento closed the quarter with a 24-8 run. Fox started the key stretch with a pair of free throws and then registered steals on back-to-back possessions. He converted a dunk off the first steal and Iman Shumpert hit a 3-pointer following the second. The Bulls shot 22 for 41 (53.7 percent) from the field in the first half, but were just 6 for 16 (37.5 percent) in the third. Sacramento kept up the intensity in the fourth and Chicago never made a serious push. TIP-INS Kings: Buddy Hield and Shumpert each scored 14 points. Willie Cauley-Stein had 11 points and 16 rebounds. ... Sacramento improved to 14-12. It's the latest point in a season it has been above .500 since the 2005-06 season. The Kings finished 44-38 that year in their most recent playoff appearance. Bulls: G Kris Dunn (sprained left knee) and F Bobby Portis (sprained right knee) returned to the lineup after sitting out nearly seven weeks. Dunn finished with nine points in 20 minutes, and Portis had nine points in 19 minutes. ... G Justin Holiday went 1 for 6 on 3-pointers. He has made at least one 3 in 39 consecutive games dating to last season. He's the only NBA player with at least one 3 in every game this season. TIPPING POINT Less than a week into his tenure, Boylen faced a crisis over the weekend. Following the loss to the Celtics, Boylen planned to practice on Sunday even though the Bulls had played back-to-back games. Some players reportedly discussed not showing up. Instead of a practice session, a lengthy team meeting was held. Before Monday's game, Boylen said everything was fine and he would continue to push hard. ""I expected something like yesterday to happen,"" he said. ""I've been waiting on it, I was prepared for it, I took it head on."" Said LaVine: ""I think everything made us closer. Good, bad or ugly, I think that ordeal was good for the team."" SLOPPY The Bulls finished with a season-high 27 turnovers, which led to 31 Sacramento points.","401071075"
"MILWAUKEE --  It may not mean much in the standings by the end of the season, but a 16-point win over the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday may be a sign of the Milwaukee Bucks' transformation into a contender. The Bucks had beaten the Eastern Conference-leading Toronto Raptors on the road the night before for a signature victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo was a last-minute scratch on Monday with neck soreness. The 20-loss Cavaliers were in town. Milwaukee had lost to the similarly struggling Suns and Knicks earlier this season, signaling a propensity to lose focus against lower-division foes. No such problem against the Cavs. Eric Bledsoe had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks shot 52 percent from 3-point range in the first half of a 108-92 win to put the game out of reach early. ""We're just trying to build something special. We had a good win in Toronto and we just wanted to capitalize on that tonight,"" Bledsoe said. Malcolm Brogdon scored 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting, while Sterling Brown had 12 points and eight rebounds for the Bucks. Leading by 18 points at the half and by as much as 26 in the third quarter, the Bucks hardly needed Antetokounmpo. ""I do think sometimes, one of your leaders is out, and some of the other guys maybe bring their focus into a better place,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""For the most part, I thought guys didn't try to do too much to replace him."" Cleveland's Tristan Thompson had 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting and added six rebounds, but left in the third quarter with a left foot injury. Jaron Blossomgame had 11 points and 10 rebounds, while Larry Nance Jr. scored a team-high 16 points. The Cavaliers did manage to cut the deficit in half, to 13, with 5:40 left and the Bucks playing mostly backups. It was close enough that Budenholzer put most of his starters back in the game until the closing minutes. Otherwise, the game was decided in the first half, when the Bucks -- one of the top 3-point shooting teams in the league -- hit 11 of 21 from beyond the arc. Bledsoe was 4 of 5 from 3-point territory, with all his attempts before halftime. ""I'm not going to get down on them and I'm not going to let them get down on themselves when they don't play well,"" Cavs coach Larry Drew said. ""We just have to learn how to get through it."" TIP INS Cavaliers: G Matthew Dellavedova scored 11 points in 16 minutes in making his debut in his second stint with Cleveland. A fan favorite in Cleveland, Dellavedova was acquired from the Bucks on Friday in a three-team deal that sent George Hill to Milwaukee. He played sporadic minutes this season for the Bucks. He received an ovation when he entered the game. Bucks: Hill scored two points in 13 minutes in making his Bucks debut, often matched up defensively against Dellavedova. C Jason Smith, who was acquired from the Wizards in the same deal, went scoreless in four minutes in his first game with Milwaukee. ... G Pat Connaughton was inactive. BENCH SPARK Brown came off the bench to provide a spark in the first half, hustling all over the court to grab boards and defend. His transition dunk after a turnover with 2:08 left in the second quarter gave Milwaukee a 57-36 lead. PAINT JOB The Cavs had a tough enough time in the paint when the 6-foot-10 Thompson was in the game. They were outscored 50-40 in the lane and outrebounded 58-46, even with the high-flying Antetokounmpo out. Thompson said his foot was a little swollen. ""They didn't chop my foot off. I'll be fine,"" he said. FROM THE ARC The Bucks finished 15 of 36 (42 percent) from 3-point range for the night after going 4 of 15 in the second half. ""Things we talked about doing against this team, we did not do a good job with in the first half,"" Drew said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George heard the ""MVP! MVP!"" chants from the sellout crowd at Chesapeake Energy Arena, and while the Oklahoma City star appreciated them, he was happier the Thunder had just beaten the foe that ended their season last spring. George went 5 of 6 from 3-point range and scored 31 points, Dennis Schroder added 23 and the Thunder beat the Utah Jazz 122-113 on Monday night. Steven Adams had 22 points in the first meeting since the Jazz downed the Thunder in six games in the first round of last season's Western Conference playoffs. Oklahoma City overcame a 4-of-18 shooting performance by Russell Westbrook, who nonetheless managed a triple-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Oklahoma City has won 15 straight regular-season games at home against Utah, although the Jazz did beat the Thunder in Oklahoma City in Game 2 during their playoff series. The Thunder have gone 17-4 since starting this season 0-4. ""I'm going to just play hard,"" George said about the chants. ""If that happens at the end of the year, then so be it. That's the least of my concerns. Right now, I'm enjoying playing with this group. We've got a special group here. We want to win. We want to win big. That's first and foremost. Anything else after that, it's appreciated, but that's not the concern."" Donovan Mitchell battled foul trouble much of the game but led the Jazz with 19 points, while Rudy Gobert recorded his 23rd double-double with 13 points and 14 rebounds. It was the second lopsided road loss in two days for Utah, which fell 110-97 on Sunday at San Antonio. The Thunder jumped to a 6-0 lead, causing Jazz coach Quin Snyder to call a timeout just 68 seconds into the game. Oklahoma City gradually built its lead to 17 points before settling for a 57-46 halftime advantage. ""We didn't do enough on the defensive end, collectively, and that impacts everything,"" Snyder said. ""We usually weren't efficient offensively -- either didn't get a good shot or turned it over. You put yourself behind the 8-ball and you almost have to be lucky or perfect to get back in the game and we didn't play well enough."" George, who scored 25 fourth-quarter points during a 47-point outburst in a win at Brooklyn on Wednesday, nearly reprised that performance in the third quarter. George hit his first 3-point attempt 50 seconds before halftime, then hit his next four shots from behind the arc en route to a 17-point third quarter. That helped the Thunder build their lead to 26 points near the end of the period and the Jazz never seriously threatened after that, although they did cut a 29-point deficit to nine in the final minute. ""He was real balanced, under control, took open shots, knocked them down,"" Westbrook said of George. ""He played at his own pace."" Jae Crowder had 13 points and Derrick Favors had 12 for the Jazz. CLOSING TIME The Jazz outscored the Thunder 38-23 in the fourth quarter. Epke Udoh, from nearby Edmond, scored 10 points in nine minutes to spark Utah's bench. ""It's good to see guys that compete and guys that contribute,"" Snyder said. ""Any time those guys, regardless of the score or situation, they come in the game, you expect them to play the right way and they did. It was good to see their activity. They really made an effort to get the ball to the rim and as a result they created looks for each other."" For a good chunk of the quarter, Thunder coach Billy Donovan stood on the sideline with a look something between bewilderment and frustration. But except for Westbrook, he didn't bring his starters back into the game, choosing to let many of his reserves figure it out. ""I didn't think we defended the way we were capable of in the fourth quarter,"" Donovan said. TIP-INS: Jazz: Mitchell hit a halfcourt shot at the first-quarter buzzer for his first points of the game, allowing him to avoid a second straight scoreless first quarter . Ricky Rubio, who had averaged 18.8 points during Utah's previous eight road games, had 10 against the Thunder. Thunder: The Thunder are 14-1 this season against sub-.500 opponents, including the Jazz, who entered the game at 13-14 . The triple-double was the 110th of Westbrook's career.","401071077"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks were again talking about a great performance by a rookie. This time it wasn't Luka Doncic. Jalen Brunson started at point guard for the second consecutive game and scored a career-high 17 points as the Mavericks beat the Orlando Magic 101-76 on Monday night. Brunson, who led Villanova to two national championships in the past three years and was a Mavs second-round pick, replaced the injured Dennis Smith Jr. (right wrist sprain) and scored in double figures for the third straight game. And he did it Monday with Mavericks Hall of Fame point guard Jason Kidd in the house. ""Being able to perform like that in front of him is definitely special,"" Brunson said. ""But no matter who is in the crowd and who is watching, I just try and play the same way every time."" Brunson scored the first basket of the game, and Dallas never trailed against the Magic, who were playing without two rotation players. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 19 points, and Dwight Powell scored 16. Doncic had season highs with 11 rebounds and nine assists to offset a 2-for-11 shooting performance, finishing with seven points. Jonathon Simmons scored a season-high 18 for the Magic and Aaron Gordon had 10. Orlando played without Evan Fournier, who missed the game for personal reasons, and Mo Bamba, who was suspended by coach Steve Clifford for a violation of team rules. ""Yeah, it's a bad on my part,"" Bamba said after the game. ""I need to be better. Just got to be on time."" Dallas never trailed in winning its 10th straight at home for the first time since the 2007-08 season. The Mavericks led by as many as 28 in the fourth quarter. Brunson was 5 for 5 from the field in the first half and scored 11 points, as did Barnes, who had the Mavericks' final eight to give Dallas a 52-40 lead at halftime. Brunson then extended it to 61-44 with a 3 from the right corner with 9:05 left in the third quarter. The lead grew to 22 by the end of the period. ""He's more seasoned than you expect out of a guy in their first year,"" Mavericks guard Wesley Matthews said. ""He's stepped into the opportunity well."" TIP-INS Magic: Clifford did not detail the reasons for Fournier's absence, but said, ""It's totally excused."" Jonathan Isaac started in Fournier's spot. Clifford didn't know whether Fournier would miss more games. He also said Bamba's suspension was for this game only. Mavericks: Matthews hit two 3s, tying Steve Nash for sixth in Mavericks history with 569. Of the five above them, four were in the building Monday: Dirk Nowitzki (first), team executive Michael Finley (third), Kidd (fourth) and team broadcaster Derek Harper (fifth). Jason Terry is second. VUCEVIC STRUGGLES Orlando's Nikola Vucevic played 26 minutes despite turning his ankle during a loss Friday against Indiana. He had 16 rebounds but scored just eight -- his first game below double digits this season. ""I didn't think he played with nearly the energy level frankly that he has been most of the year,"" Clifford said. IT'S BEEN A WHILE For perspective on how long it has been since Dallas won 10 games in a row at home, consider that the 2007-08 season was the last one the Mavericks were coached by someone other than Rick Carlisle, who took over for Avery Johnson after that season. The Mavericks' final loss of that regular season came against the Seattle SuperSonics, led by then-rookie Kevin Durant. The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City after that season.","401071078"
"DENVER --  Little surprise, Nikola Jokic had another big game. Pleasant surprise, Monte Morris found a groove. Jokic had 27 points and 12 rebounds, Morris tied a career high with 20 points and the injury-depleted Denver Nuggets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 105-99 on Monday night. Morris gave the Nuggets the lead for good on a 3-pointer with 5:22 remaining. The reserve also had five assists and five rebounds. ""Monte Morris was MVP of the game,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He was phenomenal tonight. His floor game. His shot making. His rebounding. His playmaking. We do not win that game without Monte."" Over the offseason, Morris overhauled his jumper -- more of a follow-through, less of a flicking motion -- and it has given him added confidence. He also received some recent advice from Malone that he has taken to heart -- if a defender is guarding him too close, don't run the play, just attack the basket. So that's what he's been doing. He scored 15 points in the second half. ""I have to change my mindset from being that facilitator and scoring here and there to being more in attack mode for the team,"" Morris said. ""Especially with guys out."" Mason Plumlee added 12 points and 10 rebounds in his first start of the season for the Nuggets, who were missing Gary Harris, Paul Millsap and Will Barton due to injuries. Jamal Murray also was dealing with a bruised right shin and took a hard hit on a screen just before halftime, knocking the wind out of him. He finished with 16 points. ""We're just a deep team,"" Plumlee said. ""We have a lot of guys that can play and we have some guys that you haven't even seen yet."" This was a tightly contested game that featured 15 lead changes. Neither team opened more than an eight-point advantage. ""They made extra plays,"" said Mike Conley, who had 19 points for Memphis despite playing with a dislocated right pointer finger. ""On our end, we didn't execute our offense. Guys weren't ready to shoot the ball. We weren't all in sync at the right time. When you aren't playing on the same page late in the game like that, it's hard to win."" Conley pulled the Southwest Division-leading Grizzlies to 98-97 with 3:44 left on a three-point play, but the Nuggets responded with baskets from Jokic and Murray. It was a little more high-scoring than their Nov. 7 contest, when the Grizzlies won 89-87. In that game, Jokic attempted just one shot. This time, Jokic was more aggressive in going 9 of 14 from the floor. ""He had to play better with all those guys out,"" said Marc Gasol, who scored seven points for Memphis. ""Tonight, there wasn't much we could do about him."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: The Grizzlies had a stretch in the first half where they hit 11 straight shots. ... F JaMychal Green had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Nuggets: The Nuggets returned home after a 3-2 trip. ... Denver and Memphis each had 22 assists. NICE SHOT Jokic was pretty much hitting everything in the first half, including a shot when he was inbounding the ball toward the rim with 2.9 seconds remaining before halftime. Of course, it didn't count. INJURY UPDATE Conley briefly left in the third quarter with a hamstring that tightened up on him. ""We went back in the room and we stretched it out,"" Conley said. ""I played a lot better after I returned."" YOUNG AT HEART On Monday, the Nuggets signed veteran guard Nick Young under the injury hardship relief exception granted by the NBA. He didn't get in the game against the Grizzlies, but the team plans on getting Young up to speed quickly. Malone said Young brings a little more of a long-range threat to the floor. Young has been a 37.6 percent shooter from 3-point land for Golden State, Los Angeles Lakers, Philadelphia, Los Angeles Clippers and Washington. ""Whatever uniform he's worn, he's a proven scorer and a proven shooter,"" Malone said.","401071079"
"PHOENIX --  Overtime has been kind to the Clippers this season, and Los Angeles needed it to overcome a short-handed Phoenix Suns team 123-119 on Monday night. The Clippers won their fourth overtime game of the season -- without a defeat. Tobias Harris scored 33 points and Patrick Beverley made two free throws with 33.3 seconds left in overtime to lead the Clippers to victory. Avery Bradley sealed the Clippers' 17th win of the season with a pair of free throws with 1.6 seconds left, after he hustled to control a loose ball off a jump ball and was fouled. Danilo Gallinari scored 16 of his 25 points in the second half and Harris added eight rebounds. ""We won. That's all you need to do on the road,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Once we got to overtime the guys said, `OK we are good.' We're 4-0 now in overtime. Maybe that's where we should start playing games like that."" Deandre Ayton led the Suns with 20 points and 12 rebounds, the rookie's 15th double-double of the season. Fellow rookie Mikal Bridges added a career high 19 points, and backup center Richaun Holmes chipped in a season-high 19 points as the Suns lost their ninth straight. The Clippers twice led by four points in overtime, but the Suns tied it at 119 on Troy Daniels' reverse layup with 51.3 seconds to play. But those were the last points scored by the Suns. ""These are games very important for them (the Suns) as players, too,"" Harris said. ""Once we picked our physicality up, that was when we were able to see a lot of things go our way."" The Suns' De'Anthony Melton hit a short baseline fadeaway to tie the score at 111 with 5.5 seconds left in regulation. The Clippers had the final possession of regulation, but Gallinari missed a step-back 3-point attempt at the buzzer with two defenders in his face. Holmes dunked with 7:09 to play to give the Suns a 104-95 lead. But the Clippers rallied, surging ahead by four, 109-105. Then Bridges hit a 3-pointer for the Suns with 1:16 left, and added a technical foul free throw 18 seconds later to tie it at 109. ""We gave ourselves a chance to win this game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We're going to learn,"" Bridges said. ""We're young. It's a long season and we're making strides in the right direction."" Both teams were without top scorers for the second half. Clippers guard Lou Williams left the court in the second quarter with what was announced as a sore left hamstring, and didn't return. Williams, who was averaging 17.6 points per game going into Monday, had seven points and four rebounds in 12 minutes. The Suns got forward T.J. Warren back from a right ankle injury after he missed the past five games. Warren, however, was ejected for drawing back-to-back technical fouls near the end of the second quarter. He had six points in 12 minutes. The Clippers' Montrezl Harrell scored seven points in less than a minute in the second quarter as Los Angeles came back from a 10-point deficit. Los Angeles went ahead by as many as nine points, 56-47, after Warren's ejection. But the Suns finished the half on a 9-2 run, capped off by Ayton rattling in a 20-footer at the buzzer, and trailed 58-56. The Clippers made 15 of 23 shots in the second quarter. Phoenix took a brief one-point lead, 84-83, late in the third quarter, but the Clippers went into the fourth quarter ahead 88-86. TIP-INS Clippers: G Milos Teodosic saw action for the first time in four games, having missed the previous three due to a coaching decision. ...  The Clippers have won 10 straight over the Suns, with their last loss coming April 13, 2016. Suns: Phoenix announced the signing of post player Eric Moreland right after tipoff.

The Suns were without guard Devin Booker, inactive for the fourth straight game with a hamstring strain, and guard Jamal Crawford, who was out with a sore left knee. DANIELS LEAVES, RETURNS Daniels crumpled to the floor with less than a minute to play trying to defend in the key, and had to be helped to the locker room. He returned for overtime. BLOCKED AND BLOCK Ayton tried to go up strong with the ball in the paint midway through the first quarter, only to have his shot blocked by Boban Marjanovic. But Ayton got back on defense to swat away Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's layup attempt at the other end.","401071080"
"Draymond Green expresses his thoughts on how anxious he was to play again and explains what he thought of his performance in the Warriors' win. (1:11) OAKLAND, Calif. --  Steve Kerr long ago ran out of superlatives to describe Stephen Curry. The Warriors coach isn't even trying anymore, not with the way his All-Star point guard is playing since coming back from a groin injury. Curry had 38 points, seven rebounds and six assists, and Golden State beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-108 on Monday night in Draymond Green's return to the Warriors' lineup. Klay Thompson scored 26 points and Kevin Durant had 22 as Golden State prepared for Wednesday's showdown with Toronto by earning its fourth straight win. Curry went 7 for 14 from 3-point range. ""He's good at basketball,"" Kerr deadpanned. ""Nothing he does surprises me. Even on a night he gets off to a slow start he finds a way."" Curry, who recently returned after sitting out 11 games with an injured groin, got going after missing six of his first nine shots. He made a pair of 3s and scored 14 points in the third quarter, including Golden State's final nine of the period, and then made consecutive shots from deep after the Timberwolves closed to 101-93 in the fourth. Thompson and Durant provided plenty of support. It's the fourth time this season that the trio has scored 20 or more points in the same game. Curry is averaging 31.4 points in five games since coming back from the injury. ""We were trying to do a lot in the first half just because we had another playmaker out there,"" Curry said. ""We were playing really, really fast and excited. Just had to settle in and make the simple play. In the second half we kind of slowed down."" Green, the 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, had seven points, 10 rebounds and seven assists after being sidelined for 11 games with a right toe injury. He made his first shot, a 3-pointer, and then playfully challenged the Timberwolves to come guard him. ""I felt like a kid in the candy store the last few days,"" Green said. ""To come back off a layoff like that, I felt pretty good. I really had no issues at all. It's good to get back to who we are."" Karl Anthony-Towns had 31 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota. Derrick Rose added 21 points. ""It's a great team and to beat a great team you've got to play 48 minutes,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We didn't do that."" The Warriors led 12-0 early and got a spark from Green. After making his 3-pointer, Green had a second bucket on a goaltending call against Gorgui Deng, and then scored on a driving layup. The excitable Green also picked up a foul for setting an illegal screen and jawed at a referee while walking down the court. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Robert Covington scored seven points on 2-of-7 shooting in his return after sitting out Saturday's loss in Portland. ... Rose scored 11 points in the second quarter, and then made an outstanding play to block a 3-point attempt by Jonas Jerebko near the Minnesota bench in the third. ... Minnesota has lost six straight to Golden State. Warriors: Thompson made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first half. ... Andre Iguodala did not play because of tightness in his right hip. ... Curry, Durant and Thompson have each scored 20 or more points in the same game 35 times as teammates. COUSINS GETTING CLOSE DeMarcus Cousins practiced with the Warriors G-League team in Santa Cruz earlier in the day, and then was back on the court at Oracle to put in some extra work before the game against the Timberwolves. There is still no timetable for Cousins' return from a torn Achilles tendon, but the four-time All-Star center is definitely getting close. ""We want to make sure he's really comfortable with his conditioning and movement before we put him out there,"" Kerr said. ""Everything has come along nicely. This is not about a doctor saying he can't play. It's more about when he's ready to go out there and perform well.""","401071081"
"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James hit his first free throw to put the Lakers up by two. Dwyane Wade sidled up to him before the second shot. ""Bro, just miss it so I can shoot the game-winner,"" Wade said in the waning seconds of their last game together. ""Me and you. One on one. Just let me shoot it and go for it."" LeBron didn't miss. Dwyane didn't really expect him to. They still got that last showdown, one on one with the game on the line. Wade launched a 27-foot fadeaway jumper that didn't go down, and the buzzer eventually sounded on the Lakers' 108-105 victory over Miami on Monday night while they scrapped for one last rebound. To the final moment in their 16 seasons of simultaneous stardom, these rivals and teammates competed with passion and love. When it was over, they hugged and vowed to get together soon. ""That's just us,"" James said. ""Some people say you shouldn't be friends with your competitors. But even with our friendship, we competed against each other and we pushed each other."" James scored 28 points and Los Angeles survived Wade's 15-point performance in the second half. James and Wade savored what was likely the final joint chapter of two careers that have intersected repeatedly since they entered the NBA together in 2003. After seven seasons as Eastern Conference rivals, Wade and James teamed up with the Heat in 2010 to win two championships while reaching four consecutive NBA Finals, and they spent half of last season together in Cleveland. Wade intends to retire after this season, and Staples Center sent him out of Los Angeles in style with multiple standing ovations and a tribute video in the first quarter. Wade's wife, actor Gabrielle Union, was among the fans at courtside as the high-scoring guard played 32 minutes and got rolling with a second-half flurry that recalled his prime. James and Wade both missed big shots down the stretch, but James hit those two free throws with 22.5 seconds left. They also got to guard each other down the stretch, their teammates stepping back to allow the superstars to revel in the spotlight. ""This was the last time I was going to be able to guard him, so I waited to the end,"" said Wade, who finished with 10 assists and five rebounds after a scoreless first half. ""He knows my moves just like I know his moves. I just wanted to enjoy the competition for the last time."" They traded jerseys after their postgame chat, but they could be even closer in the future. Wade expects to spend more time in Los Angeles next year in retirement, and James has already invited him to work out together and to ""help me out with the young guys"" on the Lakers. Kyle Kuzma scored 33 points for the Lakers, who have won 13 of 17 overall and five straight at home. Justise Winslow scored a career-high 28 points for Miami, hitting six 3-pointers in the third stop on the Heat's six-game road trip. TIP-INS Heat: Hassan Whiteside missed his third straight game. He is away from the team for the birth of his child. ... Josh Richardson (right shoulder) started. Tyler Johnson (bruised left hip) was available, but didn't play. Lakers: Brandon Ingram missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. He won't be re-evaluated until Saturday before the Lakers play at Charlotte that night. ... Rajon Rondo had fluid drained from his right hand Sunday, possibly signaling a delay in his return from a broken hand. The veteran point guard has been out for 3  1/2 weeks. ... A star-studded crowd gathered for Wade's final game, including Denzel Washington, Kate Beckinsale, Will Ferrell, Kevin Costner, Jessica Alba and Rams stars Jared Goff and Brandin Cooks. LEBRON ROLLS ON James is nearly three years younger than the 36-year-old Wade, and the four-time MVP is nowhere near retirement after signing a four-year contract with the Lakers in July. James' NBA-record streak of scoring in double digits reached 900 games, and the fifth-leading scorer in NBA history also passed Paul Pierce for 10th place in NBA history by scoring at least 10 points for the 1,162nd time in his 1,170 career games. ""I'm going to be retired for so long while he's still playing, people are going to forget me,"" Wade said.","401071082"
"HOUSTON -- The Houston Rockets' bench came to the rescue twice Tuesday night, and the second time made the difference. James Harden had 29 points and seven Rockets scored in double-figures as Houston used a big second-half run and snapped a three-game losing streak with a 111-104 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. Chris Paul added a triple-double with 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Clint Capela had 13 points and seven rebounds before fouling out with five minutes left, and Eric Gordon, who started in place of James Ennis, had 14 points for the Rockets, who shot 49 percent from the field. ""We did a good job of just competing, playing harder,"" Harden said. ""That was really it -- playing harder and got into them. We were a little more aggressive. Good things seem to happen when you play harder."" Houston's bench played a key role in a 24-6 first-half run that erased a 15-point deficit, and then led a charge in the second half. Gerald Green had 13 points, and Danuel House had 12 off the bench. ""They won the game for us,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said of the bench. ""They turned it around when we were down 15, and they came in, and Nene, Danuel House and Gerald put a lot of energy."" Damian Lillard had 34 points, CJ McCollum scored 23 points and Jusuf Nurkic added 15 points and 10 rebounds for Portland, which shot 44 percent after starting the game by making seven of its first nine shots. ""I thought Houston played pretty aggressive defense on us,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""We took some possessions for granted and some turnovers led to their transition. Obviously, their bench came in and hand an impact on the game. . They just outplayed us in the second half."" Houston used a 25-5 run to end the third and start the fourth quarters, and opened a 100-83 lead on 3-pointer by Harden with 6:48 left. House and Green each had five points in the run. ""I think you could really tell the difference (in) the second half,"" Green said. ""I thought that we didn't give up a lot of offensive rebounds that was really killing us in the first half. Our pace was really good tonight. I feel like we were playing faster. We were getting out in transition a lot more than we did in the last few games. I think it was something we can build on."" The Blazers responded with a 14-2 run and cut the lead to 102-97 when Nurkic made a pair of free throws with three minutes left. After trading baskets, Houston pushed the lead to 107-99 on a free throw by Harden and two free throws by Paul. After Lillard missed a layup, Paul hit two more free throws to push the lead back to 10 with 1:38 left. Portland got no closer than eight the rest of the way. ""We dug ourselves into a hole, and with the style that they play, you're going to have a chance to get back into it, but it's a tough battle when you have to fight back into the game,"" Lillard said.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Bryn Forbes was happy to finally earn the first double-double of his basketball career, and even happier that it came in another San Antonio Spurs victory grounded in defense. Forbes had a season-high 24 points and a career-best 11 rebounds as the Spurs beat the Phoenix Suns 111-86 on Tuesday night. Since his days on the playground in elementary school until now, Forbes never had a double-double, and the odds of accomplishing it weren't great. Generously listed at 6 foot 3, his previous career-high in rebounds was five, but he surpassed that in the third quarter. `That's important to me,"" Forbes said. ""I've been playing my whole life and to accomplish something I've never accomplished is always pretty cool, but to get the win was bigger. We needed this win worse than I needed a double-double."" The Spurs held the Suns to a season-low output for an opponent, two weeks after a four-game stretch in which three opponents beat them by 30-plus points. San Antonio has won three straight halfway through a six-game homestand. The Spurs, who were allowing 113.3 points per game, have limited their opponents to 101 points during their winning streak. ""It was the third game in a row where everyone was involved and played the way that we wanted to play,"" San Antonio guard Patty Mills said. ""The emotion is there. The feeling that everyone is contributing to a win like that is good for everyone involved."" The Spurs' LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 points in 25 minutes. He sat out the fourth quarter with San Antonio leading by as many as 25 points. Phoenix, which was without leading scorer Devin Booker and Jamal Crawford, never led while dropping its 10th straight game and falling to 4-24. Suns coach Igor Kokoskov also opted to rest Trevor Ariza after losing in overtime to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night. ""Extremely tough, you couldn't even imagine,"" Kokoskov said of being without his veterans. ""When you're coaching the game, you feel like you're coaching summer league because you have backups. We have a bunch of young guys, so it's extremely tough."" T.J. Warren led the Suns with 23 points and De'Anthony Melton added 17. Rookie DeAndre Ayton was the only other Phoenix player in double figures, scoring 12 points on 6-for-10 shooting. DeMar DeRozan was held to a season-low five points, but the 6-foot-7 guard attempted just six shots as he set up his teammates. DeRozan had eight of his nine assists in the first half, setting up six 3-point shots by drawing the defense into the lane on his drives. ""That's what makes great players,"" Mills said. ""I think that's also the way of making sure that everyone on the floor is involved. I guess in a sense it's the weapons that we have on the team. He can go for five points and nine assists and have other people step up on any given night and tonight it was Bryn."" Four of DeRozan's assists in the first half were to Forbes. An undrafted free agent out of Michigan State, Forbes matched a career high with five 3-pointers. ""I've been off for a little bit the last couple of games, so it was good to see them go back in,"" Forbes said. ""But DeMar, Rudy, those guys, made the game easy. They found me wide open because people were doubling them."" San Antonio finished 13 for 21 on 3-pointers, falling one shy of matching their season-high for 3s. TIP-INS Suns: Booker missed his fifth straight game with a strained left hamstring. Booker suffered the injuring trying to save possession on a ball going out of bounds against the Lakers on Dec. 2. . Phoenix has had eight different players lead the team in game scoring this season. . Warren's season high is 29 points, which he set Nov. 8 against Boston. Spurs: DeRozan's eight assists in the first half were the second-most he has had in any half in his career. DeRozan had 10 assists and 30 points in the second half against Portland on Feb. 1, 2014. .

"LOS ANGELES --  Kyle Lowry was in a funk right along with his Toronto Raptors. He had a combined 15 points in his last five games while the team had lost three of four. Adding to their woes, leading scorer Kawhi Leonard was out with a bruised right hip against the surprising Clippers. ""It was just time for me to step up and play,"" Lowry said. Serge Ibaka had 25 points and nine rebounds, Lowry added 21 points while making four of the Raptors' 14 3-pointers, and Toronto cruised past Los Angeles 123-99 on Tuesday night. ""We didn't slow it down,"" Lowry said. Toronto shot 52 percent from the floor, had 34 assists and outscored the Clippers 28-4 in fast-break points. ""This was a game everybody thought would be very difficult for us to win,"" coach Nick Nurse said, ""but we kind of lined up all these things and were very focused."" Fred VanVleet kept the ball moving in place of Leonard with a career-high 14 assists. ""Whether Kawhi played or not, I think he was going to have a healthy game,"" VanVleet said of Lowry. ""When he's playing like that, we're going to be a tough team to beat."" The Clippers endured their biggest loss of the season against the NBA's best team (22-7). ""From the start you could see the Raptors pushing the pace at us the entire game,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, ""and we really never caught up to it."" With leading scorer Tobias Harris held to 10 points -- he averages 21.4 -- the Clippers were led by a pair of reserves. Boban Marjanovic had 18 points and Tyrone Wallace added 15. Their fourth loss in six games dropped them into a tie for second with the Lakers at 17-10 in the Pacific Division. ""We just gave in to their offensive pressure,"" Rivers said. The Raptors extended their lead in the third quarter, using an early 10-0 run followed by five consecutive 3-pointers to go into the fourth ahead 103-74. Lowry hit three of the 3s and Delon Wright had two. ""When he let go he knew it was going in,"" Nurse said of Lowry. Ibaka had back-to-back monster dunks before the 3-point onslaught began, drawing cheers on Canada Night at Staples Center. Both teams played their reserves in the fourth, but the Clippers were too far behind to make a serious dent. TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse plans to coach at Golden State on Wednesday before returning to Carroll, Iowa, where his 94-year-old mother died Monday.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Hornets celebrated too soon and then weren't sure whether they'd be celebrating at all. Meanwhile, team owner Michael Jordan chewed out one of his own players. Jeremy Lamb's first NBA buzzer-beater was no ordinary game-winning shot. Lamb knocked down a 22-foot jumper from the right wing with three-tenths of a second left, then had to wait to see whether it counted after the Hornets were assessed a technical foul for having too many players on the floor. The basket was upheld, and the Hornets escaped with a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night after trailing by 10 late in the fourth quarter. As Lamb thrust out his chest and yelled, and the crowd erupted with screams, officials quickly blew the whistle and gathered at the scorer's table to check the replay monitor. Replays showed Malik Monk and later Bismack Biyombo had come off the bench and run several yards onto the floor in anticipation of Lamb making the shot at the other end. ""I thought they were going to call like three techs, get three free throws -- something like that,"" Lamb said. As Monk, a second-year player from Kentucky, retreated to the bench, he got chewed out by Jordan, a six-time NBA champion who was sitting at the end of the bench. Jordan playfully slapped at the back of Monk's head -- twice. Monk smiled with a touch of embarrassment. The Pistons, trailing by two at the time, were only given one technical foul shot, which they made. Detroit's ensuing long inbounds pass was intercepted as time expired. ""My heart stopped for a second there,"" said Hornets coach James Borrego, who noted that he had never previously seen that call made in professional basketball. The Associated Press requested clarification on the call after the game, but the officials already had left the arena and were unavailable for comment. The Pistons weren't upset over the ruling. Detroit guard Langston Galloway was more irritated that the Pistons went almost six minutes without a field goal late in the fourth quarter, surrendered a 10-point lead and allowed Lamb to make the jumper on a simple drive-and-kick from Kemba Walker. ""I can't get into the he said, she said,"" Galloway said. ""We just have to take away that basket and not allow him to get a good shot like that."" Walker led the Charlotte comeback. He finished with 31 points and had nine assists and eight rebounds for the Hornets, who won their third straight and moved into sixth place in the Eastern Conference -- a half-game ahead of Detroit. Blake Griffin had 26 points, 10 rebounds and 7 assists for the Pistons, who have lost six in a row. Trailing by 10 with 6:23 left in the fourth quarter, Walker put his team on his shoulders. Walker scored 11 of the game's next 13 points to put the Hornets up 104-101 with 47 seconds left as part of a 13-0 Charlotte run. Walker was 4-of-18 from the field in the first three quarters but was 4-of-7 in the fourth. Andre Drummond broke the nearly six-minute drought for Detroit when he answered with a three-point play in the low post to tie the game with 35 seconds left. Both teams missed opportunities -- including Griffin, who missed two free throws -- before Lamb connected. TIP-INS Pistons: Reggie Jackson had 18 points for the Pistons. ... Detroit outrebounded Charlotte 49-42. Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist did not play for personal reasons. ... Charlotte got a big lift off the bench in the first quarter from Willy Hernangomez, who had nine points in final four minutes as the Hornets built a 37-25 lead. DOUBLING DOWN The Hornets came up with a pair of turnovers against Griffin by doubling him in the low post and swatting the ball away. ""We were active,"" Borrego said. ""We had a swarming mentality."" GUARDING KEMBA Bruce Brown called Walker a ""great player, a great scorer."" ""You just have to try to contain him,"" Brown said. ""He's going to get his buckets some way, but you just have to try and hold him below his average and not foul him when he gets to the rim.""","401071086"
"CLEVELAND --  A laugher nearly turned into a nightmare for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Jordan Clarkson scored 28 points and a basket by Rodney Hood in the fourth quarter gave Cleveland a late lead as the Cavaliers defeated the New York Knicks 113-106 Wednesday after squandering a 22-point lead. The Cavaliers ended the game on an 8-0 run sparked by Hood's basket and two free throws by Matthew Dellavedova, who had a season-high 15 points in his first home game for Cleveland since being re-acquired from Milwaukee. Dellavedova, who became a fan favorite in his first tenure with the Cavaliers from 2013-16, received a standing ovation when he entered in the first quarter. Dellavedova hit his first two 3-pointers in the half, leading to a louder roar with each shot. ""It feels great to be back,"" he said. ""Big rims here, so it was nice to see a few go in early."" Dellavedova, who had three 3-pointers, three assists and four rebounds in 22 minutes, led Cleveland's bench, which outscored New York 64-24. He played in only 12 games with the Bucks, but has averaged 18 minutes in two games with Cleveland ""He did a terrific job,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""He really hasn't been playing so we don't want to burn him out early. He brings so many intangibles and things we need as a team."" Hood put the Cavaliers in front 107-106 with 23 seconds remaining after New York took a one-point lead on rookie Kevin Knox's fast-break dunk with 32 seconds left. Hood scored 23 points and rookie Collin Sexton had 19. Enes Kanter and Tim Hardaway each scored 20 points for New York, which lost its fifth straight. Knox, moved into the starting lineup before the game, finished with 19. Emmanuel Mudiay missed in the lane following Hood's basket and Cedi Osman made two free throws, putting Cleveland up by three. Larry Nance Jr. stole Mudiay's inbounds pass and Dellavedova's two free throws pushed the Cavaliers lead to 111-106. Cleveland led 53-31 midway through the second quarter, but New York began a flurry that carried through the third period and tied the game at 86. The matchup of teams near the bottom of the Eastern Conference began as a blowout, but turned into a tight contest. ""The game was lost in the first quarter, but I am happy with the way we fought back,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. ""These guys never stop fighting."" Cleveland hit 15 of 28 shots in the first quarter and built a 53-31 lead midway through the second. Kanter helped move the Knicks closer with nine points in the quarter. New York's run continued in the third quarter and Drew called two timeouts in the first four minutes of the period. Cleveland played its first game without center Tristan Thompson, who could miss a month with a sprained left foot. Thompson is averaging 12 points and 11.6 rebounds in 27 games. The eight-year veteran was injured when he twisted his foot while landing on the foot of Milwaukee guard Malcolm Brogdon on Monday. KNOCK IT OFF Nance has quickly become a fan of Dellavedova, even though they have only played two games together. Nance waved his hands to the fans after they began an ""MVP"" chant for the guard. ""He needs to stop that,"" Dellavedova said with a laugh. ""He's fun to play with, but he needs to stop that."" GOOD MOVE Fizdale started Knox in place of Mario Hezonja and the decision nearly gave New York the win. Knox's dunk off a turnover put the Knicks ahead. ""Two-on-one, I knew we were down one,"" he said. ""They (my teammates) have been waiting for a while to see that dunk, so I gave it to them."" ""Every game, you're seeing him get a little bit better, doing more things out there for us,"" Fizdale said. TIP-INS Knicks: Mudiay and Frank Ntilikina each scored 16 points. ... New York took a 6-4 lead, but was outscored 33-17 the rest of the first quarter. ... New York is 5-11 on the road.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  For three weeks, Indiana found ways to fill the void left by Victor Oladipo's absence. When the All-Star guard returned from a sore right knee Wednesday, the Pacers proved they could plug holes in other ways, too. Thaddeus Young scored a season-high 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, Myles Turner added 23 points and the league's stingiest defense held Milwaukee's vaunted offense in check long enough to pull away for a 113-97 victory. ""We were together from the jump (defensively),"" Turner said. ""We got off to a great start and we just kept that energy throughout the game. That's what our team has lacked in the past and we've been bringing it these last couple games."" It certainly showed against the Bucks. Indiana led from wire to wire, extending its season-best winning streak to five by beating the Central Division-leading Bucks at their own game. The Pacers dominated the NBA's top rebounding team, 55-43 overall and 14-9 on the offensive end. They went 12 of 30 on 3-pointers and held the league's highest-scoring team nearly 22 points below its season average. Even the return of All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo from a sore neck didn't really help Milwaukee, which has lost three of its last four road games. Young thought the reason was clear: Indiana put on a defensive clinic by jumping into passing lanes, driving lanes and beating the Bucks' rebounders to the spot. ""Great team defense,"" Young said, explaining how he held Antetokounmpo to a season-low 12 points. ""He's a tough guy to guard, especially in transition. He's got me tired right now. It's just about believing in our system, believing what works on the defensive end and just taking a stand."" The victory moves Indiana within a half-game of the division lead. But on a night the Pacers seemed to do nothing wrong, little went right for Milwaukee. Eric Bledsoe led the Bucks with a season-high 26 points on 11-of-16 shooting. Brook Lopez added 15 but was 4 of 12 on 3-pointers. Antetokounmpo had 10 rebounds and seven assists along with his dozen points but also was called for five fouls and didn't play like his typical self. ""They were very good tonight. We couldn't match it,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We just couldn't make enough plays."" The most surprising part was how quickly things got out of hand. Indiana scored the first six points and built a 22-9 lead less than five minutes into the game. After Milwaukee cut the deficit to 25-23 late in the first quarter, the Pacers answered with a 12-2 run and extended the margin to 58-41 at the half. They made it 64-43 early in the third and couldn't get closer than 10 until Bledsoe's 19-foot jumper with 4:25 left in the game. But Turner hit his career-high-tying fourth 3 and Oladipo made a 12-footer to make it 106-93, and the Bucks couldn't get within single digits again. Oladipo had 12 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. TIP-INS Bucks: Scored a season-low 43 points in the first half. Their previous low was 45. ... Antetokounmpo didn't make a basket until scoring on a layup with 1:44 left in the first half. He was 4 of 7 from the field. ... George Hill scored four points in the return to his hometown. ... The Bucks were 11 of 43 on 3s. Pacers: Bojan Bogdanovic scored 16 points to extend his career-best streak of consecutive double-digit games to 19. ... Domantas Sabonis had 12 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. ... Turner also had seven rebounds, four assists and three blocks. ... Indiana has held the rebounding advantage in every game during its winning streak. ... Indiana is 7-1 at home against Eastern Conference teams this season and 12-3 overall. THE OLADIPO PLAN Coach Nate McMillan told reporters before the game that Oladipo's minutes would be restricted. He wound up logging 29 minutes. Oladipo plans to spend most of the next two days resting. If the soreness stays away, he plans to be back on the court Friday at Philadelphia. ""I need to be able to play at an optimum level,"" Oladipo said. ""I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go out there and play in a tough environment.""","401071088"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Spencer Dinwiddie put on his best Stephen Curry impersonation. Dinwiddie scored a career-high 39 points off the bench and Allen Crabbe had 20 to lead the Brooklyn Nets to a 127-124 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. ""If I had two 3s in a row, I feel like Steph,"" Dinwiddie said. ""I wasn't about to stop shooting after that. I don't know if I was in a zone, but if I hit two in a row, I'm hot and they know it."" Joel Embiid had 33 points and 17 rebounds and Ben Simmons scored 22 for Philadelphia, which played without Jimmy Butler because of a strained groin. It was Brooklyn's second victory over Philadelphia (19-10) in three meetings. Dinwiddie had 31 in a 25-point win over Philadelphia last month. ""We seem to make every guard look like a freakin' Hall of Famer,"" Embiid said. Down 11 in the fourth quarter, the Sixers closed to 111-105 on Embiid's free throws and a 3-pointer with 3:24 left. Dinwiddie's basket extended the lead to 115-105. Landry Shamet hit consecutive 3s in the final minute to cut Brooklyn's lead to 123-118 with 22.9 seconds left. The Nets (11-18) got a pair of free throws from Dinwiddie before Shamet nailed another 3. But Dinwiddie made two more free throws to ice Brooklyn's third consecutive win. ""It's just so evident, you can't take him out and he's playing great basketball,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said of Dinwiddie. ""Obviously, he's our engine right now, especially in the second half.  All the work he's done, he's come a long way. He deserves it."" The Nets outscored the Sixers 19-3 over a 4 1/2- minute stretch in the third quarter to build an 87-75 lead. Dinwiddie had 12 of those points for Brooklyn, including a pair of 3-pointers. ""I think when you look at the bench scoring, we got hurt there,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""I give Brooklyn a lot of credit. I think that they are a good team to begin with. I do not feel like their record reflects how good they are. I especially know that no matter what their record said, we struggle with that type of team and we did tonight. It doesn't discount for me that we do struggle with that type of team."" A 10-2 run gave the Nets a 49-41 lead in the second quarter, but the Sixers closed to 57-56 at halftime. T.J. McConnell's alley-oop lob to Simmons for a one-handed dunk highlighted Philadelphia's second-quarter comeback that was capped by Embiid's long 3-pointer. UNDERMANNED SIXERS Missing Butler and Mike Muscala hurt Philadelphia, especially with its communication. ""You get used to a guy being there and then two guys are out that you're used to having in there,"" Simmons said. ""Just means that the other guys need to step up and fill that role, whether it's coming in on defense and rebounding. Could be little things, but I think everybody just needs to be accountable; myself and everybody."" TIP-INS Nets: Dinwiddie's previous career high was 31. He did it twice, including in a 25-point win over Philadelphia last month. Dinwiddie shot 11 of 18, including 4 of 6 from beyond the arc.  ... Joe Harris had 14 points. 76ers: Muscala was out of the lineup because of an upper respiratory infection. ...

"WASHINGTON --  To Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens, Kyrie Irving's pair of 3-pointers in the final 40 seconds of overtime -- the first from in front of his team's bench; the second from straightaway, 31 feet out -- were ""amazing."" To the man contesting both of those key shots, Washington Wizards point guard John Wall, they were ""incredible."" To Irving himself? He was a lot more matter-of-fact, saying: ""I was just trying to win the game."" Did just that, too. Serenaded on the road by chants of ""MVP!"" in the closing seconds, Irving scored Boston's last 12 points to finish with 38, and the undermanned Celtics extended their winning streak to seven games with a 130-125 victory over the Wizards on Wednesday night. ""We've seen Kyrie do that on multiple occasions,"" said Marcus Smart, a guard who spent some time at center and had 18 points and five rebounds. ""But to see it again in person -- every day we see that is something that is jaw-dropping for us."" Marcus Morris added 27 points and nine rebounds for Boston, which played without Al Horford, Gordon Hayward and Jaylen Brown, its No. 4-6 leading scorers. ""The hallmark of this group has been whoever's available plays and is counted on to do what they're supposed to,"" Stevens said. ""Not everybody had their best night, but everybody did their jobs and kept adding value when they checked in. They played whatever role they were asked to and gave us a chance to win."" Wall returned after missing a game with an aching left heel to pour in 34 points with 13 assists, and stayed on the court in overtime after getting his right foot stepped on during a drive to the basket. But his seven points in OT weren't enough to keep pace with fellow All-Star Irving. The Wizards led 123-122 when Irving made a 3 with 38.6 seconds to go. After Wall tied it at 125, Irving hit another shot from beyond the arc that gave Boston the lead for good, because Beal (22 points; zero in OT) and Wall then each missed a 3. This sure was a close one: There were nine ties and 18 lead changes. Neither club was ahead by more than three points over the final 10 minutes of regulation. Up 113-110, Boston opted to foul Beal on purpose with 13 seconds left, but that backfired, because after he made the first free throw, he missed the second -- but grabbed the rebound and put it in for the tie. Irving blew by Beal at the other end but missed a layup right before the buzzer, sending the game to an extra period. And then Irving really took over. TIP-INS Celtics: Horford sat for the third consecutive game -- he's expected to miss at least a few more because of an injured left knee -- and Brown and Hayward were out because of illness. ... Outscored Washington 38-22 in the third quarter. ... Daniel Theis fouled out after just 14 minutes. He had eight points and six rebounds. ... Semi Ojeleye was 1 for 7 on 3-point attempts. Wizards: Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 20 of their 32 bench points. ... Rebounding has been a problem all season and this was no different. Washington was beaten 50-41 on the boards and outscored 24-8 in second-chance points. WALL ON THE CALLS Wall was not thrilled with the officiating, saying the Wizards kept getting whistled for ""ticky-tack"" fouls, but did not get the same sort of calls when they had the ball. ""We get so many hand-check calls to put those guys on the free throw line. Let guys make plays,"" he said. ""I mean, then we drive to the basket, getting fouled, and we're not getting it."" Washington actually took more foul shots, 29 to 25; the Wizards only made 21, while the Celtics were perfect at the line. ""We play just as aggressive as anybody else,"" Wall said. ""So I don't understand it. I don't respect it."" SMART AT 5 Smart said he hadn't played the ""5"" position since high school. ""That's just what we needed tonight,"" he said.","401071090"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Portland averages 112 points per game. The Memphis Grizzlies' defense wasn't letting the Trail Blazers anywhere near that. Mike Conley scored 23 points and keyed a fourth-quarter outburst as the Grizzlies pulled away for a 92-83 victory over Portland on Wednesday night. But it was the Memphis defense that made the difference, as the Grizzlies held Portland well below its season average, with the 83 points marking Portland's season-low for a game -- by 13 points. Leading-scorer Damian Lillard was held to 14 points -- one of his worst games of the season -- and Portland barely avoided its lowest shooting percentage in a game, hitting only 36.2 percent of its shots. ""We had trouble scoring,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Part of it was their defense. I thought our offense never really got on track after the first quarter."" CJ McCollum matched his season-high with 40 points, or things could have been even worse for Portland. McCollum made 16 shots in the game, half of the Trail Blazers' 32 field goals. Without McCollum, Portland would have shot 27 percent. Blazers players, like Stotts, acknowledged it was just a bad night. ""I played bad. I struggled,"" said center Jusuf Nurkic, a major contributor to the Trail Blazers low percentage, making only one of his 15 shots. ""Most of my shots were wide open, and I didn't make them."" Lillard added: ""They just grind you. They played physical and are a good defensive team. ... They come out aggressive and see what they can get away with."" Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 14 points, and MarShon Brooks added 13 as the Grizzlies snapped a two-game losing streak. Despite the shooting woes, Portland had pulled within 79-78 on a reverse layup by Lillard with 5:27 left. But Memphis rattled off 13 straight points, including eight by Conley, stretching the lead to a game-high 14 points at 92-78, and the Grizzlies coasted home. ""We were focused and locked-in after we started a little slowly. We put a lot of focus on the defense,"" Jackson said. CONLEY LIMPING Conley was questionable for the game with left hamstring soreness, and there were times he appeared at less than full speed. ""I don't want to full-on sprint out of nowhere, cause any further damage,"" the Grizzlies point guard said. ""So, I've just been trying -- especially tonight -- to play at a nice pace and save it for more half court. I'm not trying to get up and down and outrun you as much as I might want to."" SECOND-QUARTER JOLT Memphis got out to a poor start, trailing by 11 early. Bickerstaff went to his bench and got a more-spirited performance. ""We got off to a little bit of a sluggish start, but our bench came in and really, really sparked us,"" Bickerstaff said. ""We had a ton of energy there, and everybody kind of fed off it."" Portland coach Terry Stotts perception of it? ""Well, we had a really good first quarter. The rest of the three quarters were a grind."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Maurice Harkless did not play, sitting out the game for rest. ... Portland is in the midst of playing three games in four nights. ... McCollum missed all five of his 3-pointers in Tuesday's loss to Houston. And he missed two more before connecting from long range late in the second quarter.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis smiled slightly and joked about his relative youth when the topic of his heavy workload came up. His nearly 40 minutes on the court against Oklahoma City was hardly an anomaly this season, but Davis isn't ready to plead for more rest yet. Davis scored 44 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, and the inconsistent New Orleans Pelicans narrowly held on to defeat the Thunder 118-114 on Wednesday night. ""Whatever coach needs me to do, the team needs me to do to win, that's what I'm going to do,"" said Davis, who has averaged about 37 minutes for a team that has played an NBA-high 30 games so far this season. ""I'm 25 years old. So, ask me about five years from now."" Jrue Holiday had 20 points and 10 assists, and Julius Randle added 22 for New Orleans, which has alternated wins and losses in its past 10 games. ""It was a big win for us,"" Davis said. ""We've got to put a string of wins together and of course it starts tonight. (Oklahoma City) was the No. 1 team in the West coming into tonight and a team that's rolling. They've got a lot of great players on their team. We tried to make sure this game was about us and make sure we get back to what we do."" Paul George had 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Dennis Schroder scored 24 points for Oklahoma City, which came in having won five of its previous six. Russell Westbrook had 20 points and four steals but did not appear as eager as usual to shoot, hitting 8 of 16 shots. Steven Adams also scored 20. New Orleans seemed in control, leading 116-109 with less than 1:20 left when consecutive turnovers led to five quick Thunder points. Westbrook scored on a fast break that he initiated by breaking up Holiday's pass. Then another Westbrook steal during Holiday's drive led to George's fast-break layup as he was fouled. After Davis' missed a driving floater, Oklahoma City had an unusual possession in which no player seemed inclined to shoot, and a series of passes led to Westbrook's late-shot-clock 3 attempt, which rimmed out. Randle was fouled after his rebound, but missed two free throws to give the Thunder another chance. Westbrook again elected not to shoot, and Alex Abrines' 3 for the lead rimmed out. Solomon Hill, who had eight points, came down with his seventh rebound and made both foul shots with less than a second left to seal the victory. Davis was dominant throughout, dunking seven times, including several times on crowd-pleasing alley-oops, to go with a 3 and an array of mid-range floaters and jumpers. ""He's a great player; it takes a team to stop him,"" guard Terrance Ferguson said. ""We really didn't focus on that tonight and we let our players go one-on-one against him."" Davis scored 18 of his points in the third quarter, when New Orleans went in front for good in a competitive game that included 12 ties, 17 lead changes and no lead larger than nine points. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter by official David Guthrie for appearing to argue that a foul should have been called on his missed layup. ... Westbrook blocked layup attempts by Pelicans rookie guard Frank Jackson twice. ... Jerami Grant committed fouls off the ball twice in the first two minutes of the third quarter, at which point he had five fouls for the game and was subbed out. He did not return until 7:50 remained.

Holiday also was able to score his share inside on dribble drives. ""I'm getting in the paint, AD's already in the paint and so is Ju',"" Holiday said. ""To be able to stop that is pretty tough."" DEEP TROUBLE Oklahoma City shot 48.3 percent, but missed 30 of 43 from 3-point range. ""We really moved the ball well, and they really collapsed the paint with Davis, Randle, and (Cheick) Diallo,"" Donovan said.

"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic can call himself even with Trae Young for now. The Dallas Mavericks can finally say their puzzling losing streak against the Atlanta Hawks is over. Harrison Barnes scored 25 points, Doncic added 24 and the Mavericks extended their home winning streak to 11 games while ending a 10-game skid against Atlanta in a 114-107 victory over the Hawks on Wednesday night. J.J. Barea had 18 points before leaving with a sprained left ankle as the Mavericks finally beat the Hawks after blowing a 26-point lead in October, when Young had a strong fourth quarter in his home debut to help the Hawks rally to a 111-104 win. Young matched Doncic with 24 points and added 10 assists in the second meeting between players traded for each other on draft night. Doncic went third overall to the Hawks, who sent him to Dallas while the Mavericks picked Young at No. 5 for Atlanta. ""He's a really good player and we can only hope to contain him,"" Young said of Doncic, who was just 5 of 14 from the field but had his second career double-double with 10 rebounds while adding a team-high six assists. ""He didn't get too many good looks."" Instead of wilting in the fourth quarter, the Mavericks took control with a 7-0 opening run for a 10-point lead and eventually went up by as many as 15 before the Hawks made it closer with an 11-1 run late. The home winning streak is the longest for the Mavericks since a 12-game run in 2007-08, and their most recent win over Atlanta was on Oct. 30, 2013. Dallas had won 21 of the previous 29 meetings with the Hawks before the 10-game skid. The rematch reiterated the opposite directions both teams are headed after ending the first meeting at 2-2. The Mavericks are 13-9 since then and among the current playoff teams in the rough Western Conference. The Hawks have gone 4-19. The Mavericks played most of the second half without coach Rick Carlisle, who was ejected on two quick technicals when he thought Barnes got fouled without a call. Dallas went on a 16-5 run right after the ejection. ""He got them going,"" said assistant Stephen Silas, who took over for Carlisle. ""His energy got them going, and I tried to continue that energy with the group. They did a really good job after Rick got thrown out of the game."" Kent Bazemore scored 22 for Atlanta, and John Collins had 20 points and a career-high 17 rebounds. Role players got the fourth moving for Dallas, starting with Maxi Kleber on a dunk as he went on to score all seven of his points in the fourth quarter. Dorian Finney-Smith's free throw gave Dallas its first 10-point lead, and he finished with 11 points. TIP-INS Hawks: Vince Carter, Nowitzki's former teammate also in his 21st season, got a nice ovation when he entered the game in the first quarter. The 41-year-old scored his only points on a 3 in the first quarter. ... Collins had nine offensive rebounds, most by a Dallas opponent this season, in his sixth double-double. Mavericks: PG Dennis Smith Jr. missed his fourth straight game with a sprained right wrist. ... Doncic was 12 of 15 from the line as Dallas attempted a season-high 43 free throws. ... DeAndre Jordan had his 16th double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds. NO DIRK YET Dirk Nowitzki was inactive after being listed as questionable for the first time as the longer-than-expected recovery from left ankle surgery delays him from officially becoming the first NBA player with 21 seasons for one franchise. Carlisle said the designation meant the 40-year-old Nowitzki was getting closer to returning, but didn't want to discuss his status further before the game. GETTING CHIPPY Doncic stared down Bazemore after the Atlanta guard blocked his shot before and after the first-half buzzer, ultimately sending the 19-year-old crashing to the floor. Players from both benches mingled as they headed to their locker rooms, with coaches and officials trying to keep them separated. There weren't any scuffles, and officials looked at a replay before ruling there were no fouls. There were two double-technicals late in the fourth quarter. The first pair was called on Young and Jordan, with both appearing to plead with officials that they were having a friendly exchange. Doncic and former Maverick Justin Anderson got double techs 16 seconds later.","401071093"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell didn't want to give Dwyane Wade another chance at a comeback victory.

""It started from the tip,"" Mitchell said after the Jazz led by as many as 42. ""We came out strong and didn't let up."" Playing against one of his basketball idols probably for the final time, Mitchell unleashed a variety of moves -- the crossovers and misdirection dribbles that have prompted comparisons to a young Wade. Mitchell has acknowledged he studies film of Wade to develop his own offensive repertoire. ""I just wanted to go out there and be aggressive,"" Mitchell said. ""I didn't want to think -- just play."" On Tuesday night, Mitchell took Wade to dinner in downtown Salt Lake City and gifted him a rocking chair. Then, the second-year guard, who said he calls Wade on the phone often and picks his brain, matched up and scored on the 12-time All-Star at least a few times in the blowout. ""That was fun. He's a legend,"" said Mitchell, who thought it was one of his better two-way games. Rodney McGruder paced the Heat with 16 points and Kelly Olynyk had 14 as Miami played without Hassan Whiteside and Goran Dragic. Wade, set to retire after this season, scored six points. Less than two weeks ago, the Jazz also went up big in the first quarter against the Heat, leading by as many as 19 before allowing a 20-0 run and watching Wade sink two free throws to win it in Miami, 102-100. This time, there was no such drama. The Jazz sprinted out to a 34-10 lead on hot shooting and tenacious defense that denied the Heat any easy looks early. ""They jumped on us from an effort and energy standpoint,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We were bobbling passes, traveling, missing catches, and then it became a domino going down the wrong way. We just couldn't get it back."" Favors went 7 of 8 and had eight boards in 19 minutes, while Rudy Gobert had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Kyle Korver, who has opened up the floor for the Jazz since arriving via trade from Cleveland, made four more 3-pointers and scored 16 points. The Jazz have had an up-and-down season by any measure. This win marked Utah's second by 27 points or more in eight days, but the Jazz have also lost games by 33 and 50 points and have yet to reach the .500 mark at home (now 5-6). ""That's the tough part for us, just trying to play the same way and keep it up each game,"" Favors said. Even within the same game, the Jazz were nearly unstoppable in the first quarter -- shooting 70 percent -- but went through long stretches later in the game when they couldn't generate any offense and had a spate of turnovers. They ended up shooting 52.6 percent, including 16 of 32 from 3-point range, with 17 turnovers. The Heat have been riding their own rollercoaster. They led by 31 in the second quarter of a win against New Orleans on Nov. 30 and then trailed by 31 in the second quarter to the Jazz less than two weeks later. BABY WADE? Korver came into the league with Wade in 2003 and has heard the Wade-Mitchell comparisons. ""Their physical abilities are similar. D-Wade in his younger years -- and he still is -- was so explosive and so tough around the basket. He could get into the paint and make plays, make reads. I think Donovan has a lot of those qualities and he definitely has a good start,"" Korver said. MISSING YOU Whiteside, who left the court for the locker room during the fourth quarter of a home loss to Orlando last week, is still not with the team for personal reasons. He later said he just needed to go to the bathroom, but Spoelstra was upset and said the Heat ""handled it as a team."" Whiteside is expected back with the club on Friday. Dragic, who has battled a sore right knee for the last six weeks and had it drained in mid-November, missed the game -- his 12th scratch of the season. Fellow guard Dion Waiters hasn't played at all since having ankle surgery in January. TIP-INS Heat: Wade, making his last scheduled regular-season appearance in Salt Lake City, got a standing ovation when he checked in midway through the first quarter and another when exited the court after the game. ... The Heat's 15 points were a season low in the first quarter for a Jazz opponent. ... Miami was down 92-53 entering the fourth, the largest deficit after three quarters in the NBA this season. Jazz: Raul Neto missed the game with a sore right leg. ... The win snapped a four-game skid against Miami. ... Utah outrebounded Miami 52-30.","401071094"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Sacramento coach Dave Joerger wants his team to use its speed to run right past opponents. When the Kings are clicking, it's hard to slow them down. Nemanja Bjelica made four of Sacramento's franchise-record 19 3-pointers and finished with 25 points, helping the Kings beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 141-130 on Wednesday night. Sacramento shot a season-best 58.1 percent (50 for 86) from the field in its fifth win in six games. It also had 33 fast-break points. ""I think it was probably a pretty exciting game to watch if you're a fan -- we enjoyed it as well,"" Joerger said. ""Ball was moving. We're better when we attack."" Buddy Hield and Bogdan Bogdanovic each scored 20 points for Sacramento, and rookie Marvin Bagley III had 17 points and 10 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins scored 25 points for Minnesota, and reserve Derrick Rose finished with 20. Karl-Anthony Towns had 19 points and 11 rebounds. The Timberwolves remained winless in 10 road games against Western Conference opponents. They have just two road wins this season, tied for second-worst in the NBA. ""We score 130 points -- 80 in the second half -- shoot over 50 percent and lose. The disappointment is in our defense,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You can't jog back against them. We did that and they got easy baskets."" The athletic Kings had seven players score in double figures. Hield made five 3s, part of a 19-for-38 performance from behind the arc for Sacramento. The Kings led 63-50 at halftime, but the Timberwolves opened the third quarter with 11 straight points and 21 of 26 overall. Sacramento then responded with 11 straight points, including consecutive 3-pointers by Iman Shumpert, and never trailed again. The Kings opened the fourth quarter with a 16-7 run, including three 3-pointers by Yogi Ferrell, to open a 13-point lead. ""They ran the floor fast, they never stopped. We just had to make it hard for them and try to take things away from them, but we didn't really do that,"" Wiggins said. ""They made a lot of shots. We could have done better at taking it away from them and forcing them off the line. So it's back to the drawing board."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jeff Teague had a team-high 13 assists, but hit just three of his 11 shots. ... The Timberwolves dropped to 0-3 on their four-game trip. They lost 116-108 at Golden State on Monday night. ... The Timberwolves' 57 wins against the Kings remain their most against any NBA rival. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Minus their top player and with their coach still mourning his mother's death two days earlier, the Toronto Raptors put an emphatic stamp on a season sweep of Golden State. They did it with the two-time defending NBA champion Warriors nearly at full strength, too, a very different scenario from when the teams played in Toronto less than two weeks ago. Kyle Lowry had 23 points and 12 assists to lead a balanced Toronto offense while leading scorer Kawhi Leonard sat out, and the Raptors dominated from the start in routing the Warriors 113-93 on Wednesday night. ""When you play them you have to do a lot of things well,"" said Toronto assistant Adrian Griffin, who spoke with reporters after the game while head coach Nick Nurse left to be with his family in Iowa for his mother's funeral. ""Give our guys credit, they came in ready to play and they fought with great intensity. We knew it was going to be a challenge for us and I thought that Kyle did a phenomenal job leading the team. He is an All-Star, no doubt."" Serge Ibaka added 20 points, Danny Green scored 15, Pascal Siakam had 13 and Fred VanVleet 10 to help the Raptors improve to an NBA-best 23-7, matching the 2014-15 squad for the best start in franchise history. They did it despite not having Leonard for a second consecutive night. Toronto's star forward has a sore right hip and was considered questionable before the game. He was ruled out less than 30 minutes before tip-off. ""Long term we want (Leonard) healthy,"" Lowry said. ""We want him to take the time and get right. But knowing that him being out, a lot of things go through other people. I've been here a long time and we've always said, `Next man up.' That's how we've always treated everything."" The Raptors also lost 7-foot center Jonas Valanciunas to a dislocated left thumb in the first half. So with all that, might this have been Toronto's most satisfying win of the season? Not so fast, Lowry said. ""A good win for us,"" he explained. ""Another game on the journey of 82."" Kevin Durant had 30 points, seven rebounds and five assists for Golden State. The Warriors had won four straight heading into a much-anticipated showdown between two teams many expect to reach the NBA Finals. ""We didn't start the game off with a sense of urgency,"" Durant said. ""I don't think we overlooked anybody tonight. They just played better than us."" Despite playing the second half of a back-to-back following a 123-99 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, Toronto appeared to be the fresher team. The Raptors repeatedly beat the sluggish Warriors to loose balls and outrebounded them 48-40. It was Toronto's first win in Oakland since Feb. 8, 2004. ""It's a different vibe, a different feeling when you're on the climb like Toronto is and Milwaukee is like we were a few years ago,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It's harder to get up for each game. There are certain nights where you can just feel it; you don't have that energy. It's not an excuse. It's just reality."" The Raptors beat the Warriors in overtime earlier this season behind a season-high 37 points from Leonard. Golden State didn't have Stephen Curry or Draymond Green for that game, but both were back for the rematch while Leonard sat out. It hardly mattered. Toronto led by 18 in the first half and was up 93-67 early in the fourth quarter following a three-point play by Greg Monroe. VanVleet said the Raptors' defense was as impressive as their offense. ""They're one of the best teams in the league for a reason and their offense is so lethal that you try to take the main guys out and make them do things that they're not comfortable doing,"" VanVleet said. ""I thought we did a good job following the game plan."" Kerr benched his starters midway through the fourth as the Oracle Arena crowd filed for the exits. Curry scored 10 points on 3-of-12 shooting. Green was 1 for 5 and finished with two points as Golden State went 6 for 26 on 3-pointers. ODDS AND ENDS The Raptors swept the Warriors for the first time since 2001-02. Toronto is only the second Eastern Conference team since 2014-15 to sweep Golden State. . The Warriors fell to 0-5 this season when held under 100 points. . Curry moved past Hall of Famer Rick Barry into sixth place on the Warriors' career list for games played with 643.

"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets were clinging to a lead over the Los Angeles Lakers in the fourth quarter on Thursday night when James Harden told coach Mike D'Antoni he needed to come out for a bit to rest -- something the reigning MVP never does. D'Antoni was perfectly happy to fulfill Harden's request, and the move could not have worked better for the Rockets. Harden returned with about five minutes left to take over the game, scoring 11 points during a big run to cap a 50-point, 10-rebound and 11-assist night in a 126-111 victory. ""You play 45, 46 minutes, it's difficult on anybody in this league,"" Harden said. ""The guys are so talented and great, so that little period that I had to rest, came back in re-energized and ready to make good plays."" Chris Paul was surprised when Harden asked for the break. ""It's very rare that James or any of us would take ourselves out,"" Paul said. ""But ... I think that gave him that quick little breather that he needed to come in and finish it."" Harden grabbed his 10th rebound with less than 90 seconds left to give him his second triple-double this season and the 37th of his career. LeBron James finished with 29 points for the Lakers, who had won their previous two games. James was unhappy that the Lakers sent Harden to the line 19 times, where he only missed once. ""You can't put him on the line ... he's already talented,"" James said. ""He can put the ball in the hole multiple ways. He can drive, step-back 3s and you (can't) give him easy points."" Houston's lead was three after Kyle Kuzma's soaring dunk, but Harden was fouled on a 3-pointer and made all three free throws to make it 112-106. Harden then made 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to push the lead to 12 and cause Lakers coach Luke Walton to call a timeout. James was in Harden's face on the second one and Harden fell to the court as the ball rolled around the rim for a couple of seconds before dropping in. ""He's a superstar and he makes tough shots,"" Walton said. ""But that whole thing started with us giving him three free throws."" James added a dunk before Clint Capela and Harden made consecutive baskets to compete the 13-2 run and make it 122-108. It was the first meeting between these teams since Paul and Rajon Rondo got into a fight on Oct. 20 that led to suspensions for both players and Brandon Ingram. There wasn't an altercation this time around in a game where Rondo sat out as he recovers from surgery to repair a broken right hand. But there was a spate of technical fouls late in the third quarter that led to the ejection of Nene. He was called for a foul after being knocked to the ground trying to defend Kuzma as he drove to the lane. He yelled at officials and received a technical foul. Kuzma made his free throws but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed the technical shot. Nene made a hook shot before fouling Kuzma again on the next possession. He continued to scream at officials and was hit with a second technical foul and was ejected. Harden attempted to calm him down, but Nene continued to be agitated until he was escorted to the locker room. Kuzma made all three foul shots and added a 3-pointer with Harden in his face after a 3 by Harden to leave the Lakers up 88-87 with 9.9 seconds left in the quarter. Kuzma was called for a foul after that and Walton got a technical for arguing about that call. Harden made the technical shot and Paul added two more free throws to leave Houston up 90-88 after three. TIP-INS Lakers: Kuzma received a technical foul in the first quarter for arguing about a foul call. ... Brandon Ingram missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... Kuzma had 24 points to give him 20 or more points in a career-best six straight games. Rockets: Brandon Knight played in his first game since Feb. 15, 2017, after recovering from surgery to repair a torn left anterior cruciate ligament. He came in with about four minutes left in the first quarter and played about four minutes with one assist and one rebound. ... James Ennis sat out with a strained right hamstring. MORE HARDEN Thursday was Harden's fourth 50-point triple-double, which is the most in NBA history. It's his second game this season with at least 50 points and 10 assists and he joins Wilt Chamberlain (19) as the only players in NBA history to have more than one 50-point game against the Lakers. He scored 51 against them last season.","401071097"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs appropriately returned to their defensive principles on an evening when San Antonio was celebrating ""Throwback Night."" LaMarcus Aldridge scored 27 points and the Spurs won their fourth straight, topping the Los Angeles Clippers 125-87 on Thursday for their largest win of the season. A franchise that won five championships behind a dominant defense under Gregg Popovich has been troubled by an inability to stop people this season. Two weeks ago, the Spurs lost by 30 points in three games after the franchise suffered only five such losses in Popovich's first 1,758 games. San Antonio has since staged a revival, holding an opponent under 100 points for the third straight game while winning the first four games of a six-game homestand. With fans celebrating in giveaway T-shirts featuring the team's Fiesta colors, the Spurs feel like they have finally turned the corner defensively. ""Yeah, but we're still going to continue to get better defensively,"" DeMar DeRozan said. ""Talking, communication, but for the most part we're just going out there having fun, playing with a lot of confidence."" Rudy Gay had 21 points and DeRozan added 14 as San Antonio handed Los Angeles its worst loss of the season. ""We're just playing basketball, making it easy on ourselves,"" Gay said. ""We're moving the ball, helping each other on defense. That's what makes it fun, just playing the right way and being good teammates to each other."" Tobias Harris scored 17 points for the Clippers and Danilo Gallinari and Avery Bradley added 15 apiece. Los Angeles has lost two straight and four of five. The Spurs shot 59 percent from the field and had a 14-2 advantage on fast-break points. San Antonio shot 63 percent in the first quarter in taking a 38-27 lead that swelled as the game progressed. Playing their third game in four nights and without Lou Williams and Luc Mbah a Moute, the Clippers' only lead came in the opening 2 1/2 minutes of the game. ""I turned to one of the coaches and said, `Even if we're making shots, we lose tonight because they're just shooting the ball so well,' "" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I didn't think we were into them enough. I thought they were very comfortable."" San Antonio held Los Angeles to 20 points in the third quarter, extending its lead to 24 points and enabling Popovich to rest his starters in the fourth. ""In any stat, in any part of the floor, they were just better than us tonight,"" Gallinari said. TIP-INS Clippers: Harris was cut across the bridge of his nose when DeRozan swiped down in an attempt to strip the Clippers forward of the ball.

Bertans had five points and four rebounds in 17 minutes. ... The Spurs' 38 points in the first quarter were two shy of their season high, which they set Oct. 22 against the Lakers. ... Bryn Forbes joined Danny Green and Gary Neal as the only Spurs players to score 1,000 points and make 150 3-pointers in their first 150 games with the team. Forbes finished with 10 points and was 2 for 7 on 3-pointers. INSPIRING Rivers still has fond memories of his two seasons playing for the Spurs from 1994-96, even if it meant he had to give up his Sundays. ""Playing here with David (Robinson) and Avery (Johnson), I mean, my goodness they inspired you to do a lot of things, even go to church,"" Rivers said, laughing. ""That was a tough one. My Sundays were off, but I did (go)."" WHAT IS THAT? Aldridge isn't sure what to make of Marco Belinelli's fondness for taking off-balance shots rather than squaring up for a basket. ""You're going to get some that look great and you're going to get some that look like, `Oh Lord.' You've just got to deal with it,"" Aldridge said.","401071098"
"MEXICO CITY --  The Bulls had the fans, but Nikola Vucevic and the Magic got the win. Vucevic scored 26 points, including a tiebreaking jumper with 28 seconds remaining, and Orlando snapped a three-game losing streak with a 97-91 victory over Chicago on Thursday night in its first of two games in Mexico. Vucevic shot 11 for 21 from the field and grabbed 10 rebounds, while D.J. Augustin added 15 points for the Magic. ""It was what we came here for. We were coming from (three) straight losses and we knew the trip was not going be easy against a team that was going to regroup,"" Vucevic said. ""It was tough, but we found a way in the end and now we are focusing on Utah for Saturday."" Zach LaVine scored 23 points but the Bulls (6-23) lost for the 10th time in their last 11 games and remained with the worst record in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls, playing in Mexico for the first time in their history, were the main attraction for the game in a country where the franchise is considered the second-most popular among local fans. Many of them fell in love with the team when Michael Jordan led the Bulls to six championships in the 1990s. Most of the 20,201 fans that packed the Arena Ciudad de Mexico were using the red and black colors from the Bulls, who arrived in Mexico amid reports of turmoil in the locker room under new coach Jim Boylen. ""We knew about the fans and we wanted to come here and give Mexico City an exciting game and we did,"" said Justin Holiday, who finished with 18 points for the Bulls. ""We are on the right direction. We got another loss but we are on the right direction."" After Lauri Markkanen tied it at 91 with 1:06 left to play, Vucevic nailed a 15-foot jumper to put the Magic ahead and Augustin iced the game with four free throws in the final seconds. The Bulls led 26-24 after the first quarter, but Augustin nailed a couple of 3-pointers in an 11-3 run in the middle of the second and Orlando was ahead 39-29 with seven minutes left to play. LaVine scored on back-to-back jumpers to close the deficit to 51-46 at halftime. LaVine had 14 points after two quarters while Vucevic led the Magic with 13. Chicago started the second half on a 7-2 run and tied it at 53 after a couple of free throws from Wendell Carter Jr., but Orlando took a six-point lead into the fourth period after 3-pointers from Jonathon Simmons and Mo Bamba. The game was the NBA's 27th in Mexico, and Orlando will play Utah on Saturday. Only the United States and Canada have hosted more.

"PHOENIX -- T.J. Warren scored a season-high 30 points, and the Phoenix Suns snapped a 10-game losing streak by beating the Dallas Mavericks 99-89 on Thursday night. The Dallas loss came in the season debut of Dirk Nowitzki, who hadn't played yet while recovering from ankle surgery. When he entered the game late in the first quarter, it marked his 21st season with the Mavericks, the most by a player with one team in NBA history. Phoenix beat the Mavericks for the seventh straight time. The Suns have just five wins this season, and two have come against Dallas. The Mavericks were beaten in the season opener 121-100, also in Phoenix. Both games were late tipoffs on national television. Dallas, which had won three straight and eight of 10, made only 5 of 33 3-pointers. Jamal Crawford added 17 points and Josh Jackson 14 for the Suns. Trevor Ariza had 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists. Harrison Barnes scored 15 but on only 6-of-15 shooting for the Mavericks. DeAndre Jordan added 14 points and 15 rebounds. Dallas never led after the first quarter. Phoenix was up by 10 at halftime and as many as 15 in the third quarter. The Mavericks tied it twice early in the second period before a 9-2 spurt put Phoenix up 36-28 on Jackson's fast-break dunk. Another dunk on the break, this one by Warren, gave the Suns their biggest lead of the half at 47-36 with 1:14 left. Dallas scored the next four points before Mikal Bridges banked in a 3-pointer from 35 feet at the buzzer to put the Suns up 50-40 at the break. The Mavericks cut it to 56-53 early in the third but Phoenix got two 3-pointers from Ariza and one from Jackson in a 12-4 run to lead 68-57 on Crawford's driving layup. The Suns twice stretched the lead to 15 late in the quarter, the last time at 78-63 after Warren's driving reverse layup with 53 seconds left in the third. Phoenix led 78-67 entering the fourth. Barnes' basket cut the lead to 90-83 with 3:43 remaining, but the Suns scrambled for a loose ball and Jackson sank a 3-pointer to make it 93-83.

"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving credits Boston's defense for an offensive resurgence that has the Celtics riding the longest winning streak in the NBA. Irving scored 24 points in just three quarters, then rested in the fourth as the Celtics finished off a 129-108 rout of Atlanta on Friday night for their eighth straight victory. ""We're just pushing the pace,"" said Irving, who also had five assists, five rebounds and four steals. ""I think our identity is on the defensive end. We just try to pressure them and use that to our advantage and create opportunities on the offensive end."" Jayson Tatum had 22 points for Boston, Marcus Morris added 20, Gordon Hayward had 19 points and five assists, Daniel Theis scored 18 points and rookie Robert Williams III blocked five shots.

Mudiay knocked down the shot to help force overtime and finished with a career-high 34 points and eight assists to help the short-handed New York Knicks erase a 21-point deficit and beat the Charlotte Hornets 126-124 on Friday night. ""Anytime he gets his shoulder into his guy, he finds a way to make space,"" said teammate Tim Hardaway Jr., who had 12 points. ""We have total confidence in him."" Mudiay scored 14 points in the fourth quarter, including the fadeaway jumper to tie it at 113. Charlotte's Kemba Walker missed a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 8.2 seconds left and the game went to overtime. Hardaway and Luke Kornet each hit deep 3-pointers to open OT, and Mudiay had three jumpers to widen the gap. Charlotte missed 8 of 12 shots down the stretch. ""Like Coach always says, just keep chopping that tree,"" Mudiay said. ""He continues to get better and better,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""I thought he was really clutch."" The Knicks started the game with 10 active players and finished with just eight after center Mitchell Robinson sprained his ankle in the first period and guard Frank Ntilikina sprained his in the third. Walker had 16 points and 10 assists for the Hornets, who were hoping to win their fourth straight. Instead, Charlotte blew its biggest lead since Feb. 8, 2015, when it lost to the Indiana Pacers, 103-102. The problem?  Zone defense and turnovers -- 16 of them. ""They made the adjustment,"" Nicolas Batum said of New York's switch to zone in the second half. ""We were kind of lax on offense, because we haven't really faced zone defense this year. We didn't face zone defense for 29 minutes like we did in the second half so we've got to work on that."" Charlotte got 21 points each from Batum and Cody Zeller, and Marvin Williams added 20. Kevin Knox had 20 points, Noah Vonleh had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Enes Kanter had 15 points for the Knicks, who snapped a five-game losing streak. Charlotte and New York exchanged the lead seven times in the fourth period alone. KORNET'S CALL Kornet had 13 points in 24 minutes, including three key 3-pointers. The 7-footer was recalled from the G-League in late November and nearly cut loose to make room for Allonzo Trier, but Ron Baker was released instead. Fizdale has promised to use Kornet more. He averages 3.3 minutes per game and has only appeared in seven contests. ""When his number is called, he is ready and his hasn't been called much this year, but he's kept himself ready and mentally ready,"" Fizdale said. ""When I threw him out there, he handled business."" EMOTIONAL NIGHT Hornets legend Muggsy Bogues started to tear up during a halftime ceremony where he was honored for his contribution to Charlotte basketball. The 5-foot-3 Bogues, drafted by the Hornets in 1988, played for the organization for 10 years. SHORT-HANDED Damyean Dotson was nixed from the lineup with shoulder soreness. Recently signed guard Allonzo Trier (left hamstring) and guard Trey Burke (right knee) were also sidelined. X-Rays were negative for Robinson's ankle injury. THE JORDAN SLAP Hornets' owner Michael Jordan was seen in a video Wednesday slapping the back of Malik Monk's head after Monk rushed the court to celebrate a win prematurely, receiving a technical foul. On the slap, which picked up some national coverage, Hornets coach James Borrego said: ""Michael can create some headlines, I guess."" TIP-INS Knicks: Have given up 64 or more points in a half 15 times this season. Hornets: Took a 17-point lead early on a 22-4 run behind eight points from Walker, who had two 3-pointers during the stretch.","401071102"
"NEW YORK --  Spencer Dinwiddie and the Brooklyn Nets keep adding to a big week. The Washington Wizards sounded like a team that may be breaking up. Dinwiddie scored 27 points in his first game since signing a three-year contract extension, and the Nets beat the Wizards 125-118 on Friday night for their season-best fourth straight victory. The Wizards then returned to their locker room following their fourth straight loss to an ESPN.com report that the team was working on a trade involving Austin Rivers and Kelly Oubre Jr. with the team 11-18. A later report said the deal had fallen through, but that was after Rivers -- who wasn't aware of all the details -- believed he was departing. He said he was disappointed in part because he had just moved after being dealt from the Clippers to the Wizards over the summer. ""More so you just want things to work,"" he said. ""When I got traded, they traded for me for a reason so you'd like to see it work out."" Things are working out great for Dinwiddie, who has starred as a sixth man this season and settled the Nets down in the fourth quarter after their 16-point lead was cut to four. ""It was nice to see him after everything that's happened. I thought he took it to another level, defensively and offensively,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""He was outstanding all around. You definitely see the growth, the maturity and quite honestly leadership capabilities. He's getting better every day."" Joe Harris added 19 points for the Nets, who put up a season-high 70 points in the first half but had to withstand Washington's fourth-quarter charge. Dinwiddie halted the Wizards' run with a basket and some free throws, and Harris added some clutch baskets down the stretch as the Nets held on to remain unbeaten since a players-only film session after a collapse and loss to Oklahoma City on Dec. 5. ""Now we're kind of rolling a little bit,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Let's keep it going. Let's never get too high or too low."" Rondae Hollis-Jefferson finished with 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Nets, who shot 52 percent from the field. Bradley Beal had 31 points and nine assists for the Wizards, while John Wall had 17 points and 13 assists. Dinwiddie finished right at the 27 points he averaged in the first three games of the win streak. He had a career-high 39 off the bench Wednesday in Philadelphia and the next day agreed in principle to the extension worth about $34 million. His layup with 42 seconds left was the last basket of the third quarter and gave the Nets their largest lead of the game at 101-85. The Wizards cut it to four a few times, the last when Beal's basket with 4  1/2 minutes left made it 113-109, but the Nets scored nine straight to push the lead back to 13. ""The defense just isn't there,"" Beal said. ""We weren't guarding."" Washington held the Nets to a season-low 88 points in a Dec. 1 home victory but couldn't slow them down this time. The Nets scored 43 points in the second quarter and led 70-59 at halftime. They were 5 of 7 from 3-point range in the period. TIP-INS Wizards: F Otto Porter Jr. missed the game with a bruised right knee. ... Markieff Morris scored 15 points and Austin Rivers had 14. Nets: Allen Crabbe, who has been starting in place of Caris LeVert, missed the game with a sore right knee. Atkinson said Crabbe had banged it and expected it to be a short-team absence. ... Rookie second-round pick Rodions Kurucs of Latvia made his first career start and scored 15 points. REMEMBERING The Nets held a moment of silence before the game for Tim Bassett, who died Sunday at 67. Bassett played from the Nets from 1975-79, winning an ABA championship in 1976 and serving as the team's captain when they moved to the NBA and New Jersey. DINWIDDIE'S DEAL The Nets announced that Dinwiddie had signed his extension Friday afternoon after the sides had agreed in principle a day earlier. The 6-foot-6 guard came into the game averaging a career-best 16.9 points and the Nets believe he can continue to improve the way he has in the previous two years. ""I don't see why he can't keep trending upwards,"" Atkinson said. ""He's got all the tools.""","401071103"
"CLEVELAND --  Giannis Antetokounmpo played as if he had a point to prove. The Milwaukee star rebounded from his worst game of the season to match his career high with 44 points and the Bucks beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 114-102 on Friday night despite missing two starters. Two nights after being held to a season-low 12 points in a loss to Indiana, he was 14 of 19 from the field, made 16 of 21 foul shots, and had 14 rebounds and eight assists. ""You've got to put that game in the past,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""You put it in the past and move forward."" Khris Middleton, the Bucks' second leading scorer, was out with a sprained right finger. Malcolm Brogdon, fourth on the team in scoring, didn't play because of a sore left hamstring. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer wasn't surprised Antetokounmpo took over with his team short-handed. ""Obviously, a monster game for Giannis,"" he said. ""We kind of rode him pretty hard tonight. He was ultra-aggressive. He's a competitor. He wants to be great."" Asked what a team can do to slow down Antetokounmpo, Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said, ""There's not an answer to that. He's a terrific player. He's elevated his game over the years. He can hurt you in so many different ways."" Not only was Antetokounmpo coming off a subpar game, Wednesday's 113-97 loss was Milwaukee's largest margin of the season. Antetokounmpo made an instant impression after Milwaukee won the opening tip when he dunked on Osman on a set play in the halfcourt offense. He ended the half by finding Pat Connaughton for a 3-pointer. Antetokounmpo, who had his 20th double-double of the season, admitted he was aware of his numbers. ""At some point in the game, you realize you're scored a lot, so you look up at the scoreboard, but usually I don't even look at it,"" he said. The Bucks never trailed and held off a late Cleveland spurt. The Cavaliers cut the lead to five midway through the fourth quarter on Cedi Osman's 3-pointer, but Antetokounmpo had a three-point play and an assist on Brook Lopez's basket that beat the shot clock, pushing the lead to 111-99. Lopez scored 19 points and Eric Bledsoe had 16 for the Bucks, who have the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. Jordan Clarkson scored 23 points, and Larry Nance Jr. had 14 for Cleveland. Rookie point guard Collin Sexton had five points after scoring in double figures in 18 straight games. Cleveland played its second game without Tristan Thompson, who could be out for a month with a sprained left foot. LOOK OUT Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova dove into the scorers table saving a ball that was headed out of bounds in the second quarter and crashed into Fred McLeod, the team's television play-by-play man. The collision sent both to the floor while papers and notes went flying. Dellavedova climbed over the table and returned to action. McLeod was helped up and continued to call the game, but his chair got the worst of the impact and was replaced. Dellavedova apologized to McLeod in the locker room and told the announcer, ""I owe you a good bottle of wine."" ""I feel kind of bad because I tried to move out of the way,"" Drew joked. Cleveland acquired Dellavedova from Milwaukee for George Hill last week. Dellavedova scored 10 points while Hill had two. LONG SEASON The Bucks are in a stretch of one game in four days, giving Budenholzer a chance to rest players who are dealing with minor injuries. Middleton is averaging 17.4 points, but has been a major slump, hitting 16 of 47 from the field in the last four games. Brogdon is averaging 15.3 points and is shooting 52 percent from the field. He's made 47 percent of his 3-point attempts. Milwaukee was off Thursday and doesn't play again until Monday. Connaughton and Tony Snell started against Cleveland. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee is 9-0 after a loss. .... Antetokounmpo sat out with a sore neck Monday in a 108-92 win over the Cavaliers. ... Milwaukee broke a six-game losing streak in Cleveland.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Bojan Bogdanovic excitedly slammed the ball to the floor as the final second ticked off and a stunned crowd headed for the exits. For the entire night, 76ers center Joel Embiid electrified Philadelphia fans with one of the best individual performances of the season. In the end, it was the Indiana Pacers who made the most emphatic statement. Thaddeus Young had a season-high 26 points and 10 rebounds against his former team, Bogdanovic added 18 points, and the Pacers overcame Embiid's 40-point night to beat the 76ers 113-101 on Friday in a matchup of Eastern Conference contenders. ""This was a team win,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Embiid also had 21 rebounds, becoming the first Sixers player with at least 30 points and 20 rebounds in a game since Charles Barkley on Dec. 7, 1990. Embiid is the first player in the NBA this season with a 40-point, 20-rebound game. ""It wasn't enough,"" Embiid said. ""Next time I've gotta get 50 and 25, I guess. It doesn't matter what I had. At the end of the day, we didn't come up with the win."" JJ Redick added 22 points and Ben Simmons had 18 for the Sixers (19-11), who dropped their second straight at home after starting the season 14-1 in their own building. Both losses came without four-time All-Star Jimmy Butler, who's been out with a strained groin. Victor Oladipo played in his second consecutive game after missing 11 in a row with a knee injury and had 14 points and nine assists for Indiana (19-10), including a few clutch jumpers in the fourth quarter. Domantas Sabonis had 14 points and 16 rebounds off the bench, and the Pacers won their sixth straight to pass the Sixers in the standings. ""It was good to see him make those plays down the stretch,"" McMillan said of Oladipo. ""That was one thing we really missed when he was out -- he's kind of the closer for us."" Fueled by consecutive 3-pointers from Bogdanovic, the Pacers erased a 10-point halftime deficit to take an 80-77 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Bogdanovic's 3 with 3:46 left stretched Indiana's lead to 102-92. Facing the league's second-best defense, the Sixers jumped out to a 12-2 lead and scored 34 points in the first quarter. After the Pacers went on a 12-0 run to tie it at 38, Embiid exploded for 14 points in the final five minutes of the second quarter, including an acrobatic reverse layup while getting fouled, to put Philadelphia ahead 59-49 at the half. ""M-V-P"" chants rang out during the surge for Embiid, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds in the first half. The 7-foot-2 center has posted at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in consecutive first halves, becoming the only player in the NBA with multiple 20-10 first halves this season. The Pacers adjusted with more double-teams to slow him down a bit after the break. ""I did feel like he fatigued,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""And I give some of that credit to Indiana because of how physical they were in the second half."" TIP-INS Pacers: Cory Joseph had 14 points off the bench. ... The Pacers avenged a November loss to the Sixers in a game in which Oladipo scored a season-high 36 points. 76ers: Brown said before the game that Butler will likely return soon, perhaps for the team's next game Sunday. ... Mike Muscala (upper respiratory infection) was back after missing Wednesday's game but shot just 1 for 8 from the field. ALL ABOUT RESILIENCE When asked the defining trait of Indiana's six-game winning streak, Young pointed to the team's resilience. ""We continue to fight, continue to be there one another,"" said Young, a 12-year NBA veteran who spent the first seven years of his career in Philadelphia. ""I think the unity in this locker room is like no other."" NOT LOOKING AHEAD Although the Sixers and Pacers are two of the top teams in the East, both downplayed the significance of the result in terms of being a potential playoff showcase. ""We ain't worried about putting anyone on notice,"" McMillan said. ""We're not on red alert,"" Embiid said.","401071105"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Miami Heat didn't let a bad loss in their last game linger to the point of making a six-game road trip more troublesome. Relying on 3-point shooting during a 13-2 run in the middle stages of the fourth quarter, the Heat went on to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 100-97 on Friday night, snapping a two-game skid. The Heat were coming off a 111-84 loss on Wednesday night at Utah -- a performance coach Erik Spoelstra called the team's ""worst game of the year."" Instead of moping about the 27-point defeat, Miami fought through against the physical, slow-paced Memphis-style game. ""It's big for us, just to come back, to bounce back,"" reserve forward Kelly Olynyk said. ""We had a really tough one at Utah. ... It's big for us to come back and grind one out and get a win."" Olynyk and Josh Richardson led the Heat with 18 points apiece. Olynyk had 10 in the fourth, including a pair of 3-pointers, while Derrick Jones Jr., added nine of his 13 points in the final quarter as Richardson joined four reserves playing the last 12 minutes. Olynyk converted a pair of free throws with 7.2 seconds left, creating a 100-94 lead -- enough of a buffer as Marc Gasol's 3-pointer with 1.5 left wasn't enough for Memphis to overtake Miami. ""You can just point to character,"" Spoelstra said, adding that when his team arrived on a rainy Thursday night in Memphis, they went into the gym to ""expel the demons of the Utah game and then prepare for a game we knew would be extremely physical."" Mike Conley led Memphis with 22 points, while Jaren Jackson Jr. and Garrett Temple contributed 15 points apiece. Gasol finished with 14 points, but was 6 for 16 from the field, including missing four of his five shots from beyond the 3-point arc as part of Memphis shooting 42 percent for the game. Tyler Johnson added 17 for Miami, and -- like Olynyk -- was 4 of 7 on 3s as Miami went 15 for 39 from beyond the arc, compared to Memphis making 8 of 29. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff noted that the plays that carried Memphis to a 92-83 win over Portland on Wednesday -- defensive rebounding, extra-effort plays and other factors -- were missing against the Heat. ""They made more of them than we did,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Fourteen offensive rebounds. You get a stop and then you give that back up. Eleven more team rebounds, that's just too many possessions."" TIP-INS Heat: G Goran Dragic missed his second straight game with a lingering knee injury. ... C Hassan Whiteside, who missed the previous four games for the birth of his first child returned to action. .Miami had 30 assists in the game, the most by a Grizzlies opponent this season. Richardson had seven of the assists. Grizzlies:. Temple banked in a 33-foot shot to end the second quarter, cutting the Miami lead to 51-49 at the half. ... Memphis was whistled for three technicals in the game -- Gasol, JaMychal Green and Bickerstaff. ... F Kyle Anderson left the game in the fourth quarter with an injured left ankle. He did not return. .Held the Heat to seven points under their season average of 107.2. WADE SITS Heat veteran Dwyane Wade sat out the game with ""general soreness."" Spoelstra said the team would re-evaluate his status Saturday. With Wade playing in the Eastern Conference and the veteran announcing his retirement at the end of this season, Memphis fans missed their last opportunity to see the 15-year veteran. Memphis is one of only three teams against which Wade has not scored 500 career points. He has 481 against the Grizzlies. Wade has failed to reach 500 career points against only two other teams -- Dallas and San Antonio. He will get one more opportunity to reach the milestone when the teams play in Miami on Jan. 12. TRADE Of CONFUSION There were rumblings at the end of the game that the Grizzlies were involved in a three-team trade with the Wizards and Suns. But the negotiations were unclear which Brooks the Grizzlies were trading -- guard MarShon Brooks or forward Dillon Brooks, who has been out with a knee injury. Eventually, the confusion led to the deal falling apart completely.","401071106"
"DENVER --  For all his offensive contributions and rebounding, Nikola Jokic's most important role in the end was peacemaker. Jokic scored 24 points, Jamal Murray had 19 and the Denver Nuggets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 109-98 on Friday night after Murray and Russell Westbrook had a heated exchange. Westbrook and Murray pushed each other and argued after lining up next to each other for a jump ball in the final seconds. Jokic tried to get between them, and Westbrook threatened to beat up Jokic while being restrained. No blows were exchanged, but the final moments played out amid heightened tensions. Asked what Westbrook said to him, Jokic said he didn't remember and dismissed the dustup as ""nothing."" ""He's a competitive guy,"" Jokic said. ""He didn't want to lose. All is good. I just wanted to separate them."" Westbrook said there was a reason behind his initial shove of Murray. ""He was in my way,"" Westbrook explained. Murray said he hadn't done anything to provoke the incident. ""He tried to move me out of the way,"" Murray said. ""He shoved me first. It is what it is. I didn't do anything."" Jokic also had 15 rebounds and nine assists, just shy of a third triple-double this season. Nick Young, signed as a free agent Monday, scored six points in his Nuggets debut, including a key 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. Paul George had 32 points to lead the Thunder, who lost their fourth in a row to the Nuggets. ""From an identity standpoint and how we want to play, we want to play downhill,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I think when we got around the basket, they have a lot of physicality. They have Jokic and (Mason) Plumlee, but we had some opportunities to finish plays. Jerami Grant got into the teeth of the defense, but couldn't finish. Steven Adams had a great offensive game and had opportunities to score as did Russell Westbrook. We had a lot of guys in there, but we just weren't able to finish."" Adams scored 26 points, while Grant and Westbrook finished with 13 apiece. Westbrook and Adams also had 14 rebounds each. Trailing by 10 late in the third quarter, Oklahoma City got a layup and a 3-pointer from George in the final minute to pull to 82-76. With a 9-2 burst capped by another layup from George, the Thunder trimmed it to 99-96 with 3:20 remaining. The Nuggets scored 10 of the last 12 points down the stretch, four of them on a jumper and a pair of free throws by Murray. The teams were gathered for a jump ball with 35.7 seconds left when Westbrook, apparently upset over Murray's positioning around the circle, began pushing him. As Murray pushed back, teammates and officials quickly rushed in to separate the two, who exchanged words before the skirmish ended. Murray said the lesson he's taking from the game's finish is the resiliency the Nuggets have shown despite missing key players because of injuries. ""We're taking every game seriously,"" Murray said. ""We're playing with a lot of confidence and everybody is a threat. It's not just me or Joker or Gary (Harris). Everybody on the court is taking shots and setting each other up. We go out there and we win games. We have fun doing it. We all stand up for each other. We all look out for each other. And the more we win games, we know we can beat anybody."" The Nuggets took a 60-52 lead at halftime, boosted by Torrey Craig's perimeter shooting as he made three of his first four attempts from 3-point range. Adams scored 17 points in the first half, helping to keep the Thunder within striking distance. TIP-INS Thunder: Andre Roberson remains sidelined by a left patellar tendon injury that has kept him out all season.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A struggling Trail Blazers bench finally got rolling Friday night, setting a season high for points in a confidence-boosting win over the NBA-leading Toronto Raptors. Zach Collins scored 16 points and Seth Curry added a season-best 13, including three key 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter, as Portland held off the league's top team for a 128-122 victory. Curry and Collins both played pivotal roles off a Blazers bench that outscored Toronto's reserves 58-26. ""It was good to see everybody get back into a rhythm, and just finally have fun for once,"" Collins said. ""You know, it's been a while since we've gone out there and just played the game and had fun."" Damian Lillard had 24 points as the Blazers stopped a two-game slide. Kawhi Leonard returned after missing two games and scored 28 for the Raptors (23-8), who played without All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry. Danny Green added 19 points and 11 rebounds, matching his season high with five 3s. Lowry sat out with a left thigh bruise. Fred VanVleet started in his place and finished with 21 points. Portland led by 16 in the fourth but Leonard and C.J. Miles made consecutive 3s to pull the Raptors to 117-113 with 2:44 left. Lillard hit a 3-pointer for Portland before Leonard had another 3 and VanVleet made a layup to get Toronto to 120-118. CJ McCollum and Al Farouq-Aminu answered with consecutive 3s to extend Portland's lead to 126-118 with just under a minute to go. Leonard dunked on the other end, but the Raptors couldn't get any closer. ""We got it right where we needed to at the start of the fourth but then it was like a one-minute barrage where we had to climb back uphill again and we almost did it,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We went into sellout mode and just about got it."" Portland was in first place in the Western Conference after beating Washington on the road back on Nov. 18 to improve to 11-5. But the team lost eight of 11 going into Friday night's game to tumble into ninth in the conference. The Raptors, meanwhile, had lost just three previous games on the road this season. ""The whole bench -- let's face it, they've struggled,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""I thought all five of those guys played with a little bit of confidence, a little bit of emotion. That was good."" Lowry led the Raptors with 23 points in a 113-93 win over Golden State on Wednesday. The victory was costly, however. Jonas Valanciunas dislocated his thumb in the game and required surgery. He will be in a cast for the next four weeks. Valanciunas was averaging 12.8 points and 7.2 rebounds a game. Portland was coming off a pair of losses on the road to Houston and Memphis. The Blazers went up 42-31 in the first half after Meyers Leonard's alley-oop dunk from Evan Turner. Portland led by as many as 13 and went into the break in front 58-50. Leonard, who was 0 for 5 from the field in the first half, had eight points to open the third quarter and his jumper got the Raptors to 59-64. But he picked up his fourth foul later in the period and went to the bench for a while. OG Anunoby's jumper closed the Raptors to 82-80 but Collins answered with a 3-pointer for the Blazers. After Portland had a 91-89 edge going into the fourth, Curry made a pair of 3-pointers and the Blazers pushed the lead to 101-90. Curry hit another 3 to give Portland a 107-93 advantage.

SHAKING OFF THE RUST Leonard on weathering his slow start: ""I missed my first few shots but stuff like that shows you what kind of player you are and how much you believe in your game. I believe in myself and we still had a game to win so I just had to keep being aggressive for me and my teammates. I knew the shots would fall."" Leonard missed the previous two games with a bruised right hip.","401071108"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Golden State coach Steve Kerr praised his team's smothering defense for providing the spark it needed to bounce back from a disappointing loss. He also chided the Warriors' offense for a lack of focus that made the a late run necessary. Not much is coming easy for the two-time defending NBA champs this season, not even on a night when they got another big night from the All-Star trio of Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Thompson made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 38.5 seconds left, Curry added four free throws down the stretch and the Warriors ended the game on a big run after a sluggish start to the fourth quarter, beating the Sacramento Kings 130-125 on Friday night. ""I don't know what they shot over the final six minutes but it wasn't good,"" Kerr said. ""We knew we could get back in it if we were just poised and a little more patient offensively. We had several spurts in that second half where we sort of lost our composure and just couldn't get anything going."" The Warriors have been searching for some consistency after starting the season 10-1. They went into Sacramento having split their previous 18 games and were on the verge of a complete collapse against the Kings before holding on. Curry finished with 35 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Thompson had 27 points and nine rebounds while Kevin Durant added 33 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""Late in the game we just simplified everything,"" Durant said. ""We were down 10 points in the fourth with three minutes to go, we just simplified it."" Two days after a 20-point home loss to NBA-leading Toronto, the Warriors put up 103 points through three quarters, went stagnant for more than eight minutes in the fourth before outscoring the Kings 17-2 over the final 3:03. Durant had 13 points in the fourth quarter, including eight of the first 10 during Golden State's late surge, but Thompson came up with the biggest shot with his fourth 3-pointer of the night. The Kings repeatedly left Thompson unguarded throughout the game and paid for it in the end when his 27-footer put the Warriors up 126-125. ""Just wide open on the right wing,"" Thompson said. ""I knew one was going to fall eventually."" After De'Aaron Fox missed a jumper, Curry made two free throws with 14.8 seconds remaining. Buddy Hield's desperation 3-point try also missed, and Curry added two more free throws to close out Golden State's second win over Sacramento this year. ""They just got us with their experience at the end,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We struggled to finish some shots once a lot of their switching happened. They made some plays but we made some mistakes and they made us pay."" Draymond Green had 14 rebounds and 10 assists for the Warriors. Hield scored 27 points for the Kings. Fox had 25 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Willie Cauley-Stein finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds. The wild ending was in stark contrast to the first half when Golden State controlled the pace and the flow while leading by 16. The Warriors came out much crisper and sharper offensively than they had been in their 113-93 loss to the Raptors two nights earlier. Curry, Durant and Thompson combined for 51 point and nine 3s, and Golden State had a 13-2 run late in the second quarter to go up 76-64. TIP-INS Warriors: Andre Iguodala (sore right hip) was held out for a third consecutive game, although Kerr is hopeful that Iguodala will play against Memphis on Monday. ... Shaun Livingston did not play after suffering a pelvic contusion in the fourth quarter of Wednesday's loss to Toronto. Kings: Marvin Bagley III left in the first half with a left knee bone bruise and he's expected to miss 10 to 14 days. CLUTCH TIME Golden State is 4-1 this season and 33-3 overall when the three each score 20 points or more. ""We've been to two straight Finals together so we know how to make plays on the highest stage,"" Thompson said. ""A game in December I don't think is going to faze us. Just play under control and that's what we did in the last three minutes."" HIELD IN AWE The Kings have made big strides this season but their inexperience showed late in the game. Hield, who was three points shy of his career high, was in awe of Golden State's finish. ""In the last four minutes all you saw was Durant and his greatness,"" Hield said. ""No wonder why they are the world champion. It's just a great team.""","401071109"
"MEXICO CITY --  Evan Fournier scored 24 points, Terrence Ross came off the bench to add 10 of his 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Orlando Magic rallied from an 11-point deficit to beat the Utah Jazz 96-89 on Saturday and sweep their two-game homestand in Mexico City. Ross shot 8 of 9 from the field and Nikola Vucevic added 15 points and a season-high 19 rebounds for the Magic (13-15), who beat the Chicago Bulls 97-91 on Thursday. Orlando won despite 22 turnovers, 15 in the first half, and is in second place in the Southeast Division behind the Charlotte Hornets. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points and Derrick Favors added 21 for the struggling Jazz (14-15), who lost for the third time in their last four games. The game was the NBA's 28th played in Mexico. Only the United States and Canada have hosted more. Nine of the last 26 games in Mexico have been regular-season contests. The first-half was lackadaisical as both teams struggled. Orlando committed 11 turnovers in the first quarter but trailed only 35-33 at halftime because the Jazz shot 29 percent from the field. Fournier led all scorers after two quarters with 14 points, 10 of those through a first quarter that finished tied 14-14. In the third, the Jazz pull ahead 46-36 with a three-point play from Favors, but the Magic rallied and took a 51-50 lead with a 3-pointer from Aaron Gordon with 2:20 left to play in a period that finished 56-53 for the Jazz after a 3-pointer from Jae Crowder. Ross scored seven straight points in the fourth as the Magic surged ahead. TIP-INS Jazz: The matchup was the third game Utah has played in the NBA's Global Games during the regular season, previously playing the Phoenix Suns twice in Tokyo to open the 1990-91 season. Magic: The game was the third for Orlando playing in Mexico, following games against Charlotte in 2012 and the two this week. ... Orlando has made at least one 3-pointer in 931 consecutive games, dating to March 17, 2007. It stands as the fifth-longest active streak in the NBA. . Ross scored in double figures for the 22nd time this season.","401071110"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Luke Walton was surprised to hear that LeBron James and Lonzo Ball were only the second Lakers teammates to record a triple-double in the same game. ""I know it's not easy. There have been a lot of good players in Lakers history and I figured Walton and Kobe (Bryant) would have done it a few times,"" joked Walton, a former small forward with the Lakers. James had 24 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, while Ball had 16 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists as Los Angeles routed the Charlotte Hornets 128-100 on Saturday night. The only other Lakers to accomplish the feat in the same game were Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Jan. 22, 1982. ""It's crazy, man,"" Ball said. ""I watched a lot of him (LeBron) growing up and now we had triple-doubles in the same game. I don't even know if I dreamed of that before."" Added James: ""Any time you can put yourself in the conversation of Laker history, all the guys that have come through this franchise, it's pretty special."" James said he and Ball are ""one in the same"" when it comes to their playmaking ability. ""We are always looking for our teammates and that's the greatest satisfaction we can have when we see our teammates score the ball,"" James said. ""Always been pretty good rebounders for our positions. Him at the guard spot and me at the 4. ... We just try to be aggressive, attack the rim, make shots. We showed all that tonight."" James continued his dominance over Charlotte, improving to 27-1 in his last 28 games against Michael Jordan's franchise. He was unstoppable throughout on penetration, helping the Lakers outscore the Hornets 40-17 in the third quarter and build a 30-point lead with his second triple-double of the season and 75th of his career. He did not need to play in the fourth quarter. Ball played into the fourth quarter to earn his third career triple-double. He finished 7 of 11 from the field, helping hand the Hornets their worst loss of the season on the second night of a back-to-back. Miles Bridges had a career-high 17 points for the Hornets. TIP-INS Lakers: Here's an example of the LeBron James factor: The crowd of 19,461 fans was the largest ever to see an NBA game at the Spectrum Center. Hornets: Sideline analyst Stephanie Ready worked her last game for the Hornets and the team did a nice tribute to her on the scoreboard during the first half. Ready is moving on to take a new position outside the organization. ... Charlotte was outrebounded 52-28. HE BE JAMMING Lance Stephenson was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter for playing the air guitar and taunting Miles Bridges after Stephenson buried a 3-pointer. But Walton said the beat must go on for Stephenson. ""The air guitar, absolutely I'm OK with that,"" Walton said. ""He's been doing it and you can't take that away from the man. It's who he is. I tried once earlier this season and he just keeps doing it. That is what makes him is his competitive greatness and that is who he is."" McGEE PLAYS THROUGH FLU JaVale McGee was 9 of 10 from the field and had 19 points and six rebounds despite playing with the flu. He had a nurse with IV bags in his own private room before the game. ""I said that Tyson (Chandler) was starting if he can't go,"" Walton said. ""And right before the game they told me that JaVale wanted to give it a go, so we put him back in the starting lineup."" WALKER ICE COLD Hornets two-time All-Star Kemba Walker was held to a season-low four points on 2-of-13 shooting from the field. Once a front-runner for the league MVP, Walker is in the midst of a major shooting slump, making just 32.3 percent (34 of 105) of his shots from the field in the last six games. Hornets coach James Borrego thinks Walker will be fine. ""He's had a couple of nights where he has struggled shooting the ball but he'll continue to shoot. We trust him,"" Borrego said. ""His confidence is still there. I think he'll kick it back into gear real soon. He's having to work a lot out there. The way teams are guarding him and the way he's having to defend. For whatever reason he just hasn't seen the ball go through the net right now. ""","401071111"
"DETROIT --  Jayson Tatum leaped toward the basket and Andre Drummond met him there, blocking the Boston forward's attempt at a one-handed dunk. It was a fitting conclusion to an impressive second half of defense by the Detroit Pistons. ""I was thinking to myself as I was running. I'm like, if he gets this dunk, it's going to ignite their entire team,"" Drummond said. ""I have to do something."" There would be no late surge by the Celtics in the final minutes. Blake Griffin scored 27 points and Drummond added 19 points and 20 rebounds to help the Pistons win 113-104 on Saturday night, snapping the Celtics' eight-game winning streak. Detroit also ended its own six-game skid with a solid 48-minute effort. The Pistons took control with a 13-0 run in the third quarter and played well at the start of the fourth as well. ""They looked great. They were screening us, they were active, they were alert, they played great,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We couldn't match them shot for shot because the way we were guarding, that's what we had to do, and we just couldn't do it. So hats off to them. It's not our best game. That's it."" Kyrie Irving led Boston with 26 points. The Celtics were down nine when Drummond blocked Tatum with 1:25 remaining. Both teams shot over 60 percent from the field in the first quarter, and the game was still tight at halftime, with Detroit up 57-56. Drummond punctuated his team's 13-point run in the third with a dunk that put the Pistons ahead 76-66. Boston closed the quarter strong and trailed by just seven after three, but a 10-1 run to start the fourth put Detroit up 95-79. The Celtics missed their first seven shots from the floor in the final quarter and went over seven minutes before making a field goal. The Pistons had 20 turnovers, including eight in the fourth quarter. ""The simple plays, just making the simple pass is the key,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""The game gives you simple plays and for whatever reason we kind of get discombobulated."" TIP-INS Celtics: Marcus Smart was called for three fouls in the first 7:37. He did play a bit more before halftime and finished the game with 21 points and five fouls. ... The Celtics were without Jabari Bird (personal reasons), Al Horford (left knee) and Guerschon Yabusele (right ankle). Pistons: Detroit was without Henry Ellenson (left ankle), Zaza Pachulia (illness), Glenn Robinson III (left ankle) and Ish Smith (right adductor). ... Reggie Bullock was back in the starting lineup after missing five games with a left ankle sprain. He scored 15 points. STREAK One streak that did stay intact was Griffin's run of 20-point games. He has at least 20 points in nine straight, the first Detroit player to do that since Richard Hamilton in 2008-09. Griffin also surpassed the 12,000-point mark for his career. ""It's good to get a win. We'll take it how we can get it,"" Griffin said. ""Guys stepped up and guys played really, really well tonight. I thought we earned that one."" DIFFERENT CHALLENGE None of the teams the Celtics beat during their winning streak currently has a winning record. Detroit improved to 14-13 by snapping the streak. ""We played a team that came here to play tonight,"" Smart said. ""They hit a lot of shots and they came out with more energy than we did. They hit us in the face and we wasn't ready.""","401071112"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  James Harden may be getting on a roll, notching his second straight triple-double to help the Houston Rockets grab their third consecutive win. Harden had 32 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Rockets weathered a fourth-quarter burst to beat the Grizzlies 105-97 on Saturday night. Harden, who had 50 points in a triple-double in the Rockets' victory over the Lakers on Thursday, recorded his 10th assist on a pass to Clint Capela with 21.3 seconds left as the Grizzlies tried to trap defensively in hopes of whittling the Houston lead in the final minute. Asked if he would have gotten the assist without the Memphis defensive pressure, Harden replied with a sly grin through his thick, black beard : ""That's a good question. You never know, right?"" Capela's basket gave him 26 points to go with 10 rebounds. Gerald Green scored 17 points. Mike Conley led Memphis with 22 points, while Marc Gasol added 17 points and nine rebounds. JaMychal Green had 13 points. The Rockets made 13 3-pointers, near their average, compared to only five for the Grizzlies. ""We've got to do a better job of getting there,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of his team's 3-point defense. ""We've got schemes in place to protect us from those, and we were just late in our rotations."" The Rockets appeared to be coasting in the fourth, holding a 15-point lead with about 7 minutes remaining, but Memphis clicked off a 14-5 run to cut it to 97-91. But the Grizzlies got no closer. The run was fueled by rookie Jevon Carter making his first appearance of the season. He finished with 11 points with a couple of steals and a blocked shot. His defense sparked the Grizzlies' rally that at least made the ending interesting. ""It was just good to be out there,"" Carter said of his debut, when he guarded Harden and Chris Paul. ""It was fun. I'm a competitor. I want to play against the best and at this level, that's just what it's going to be night-in and night-out."" A trio of 3-pointers by Gerald Green reversed the momentum gained when Memphis scored 11 straight points to open the third period. Green collected 12 points in the third, helping Houston maintain a 79-65 lead in the fourth. ""Gerald Green came in and gave us a boost,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It was something that he was missing in the first half, like he was out of wind."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon, who was listed as questionable because of left knee soreness, scored four points. . Capela reached at least 20 points for the ninth time this season. ... Harden has 38 triple-doubles for his career. It was his first against the Grizzlies. ... Paul finished with 10 points and 10 assists. Grizzlies: F Kyle Anderson did not play due to a left ankle sprain suffered in the fourth quarter of Friday's loss to Miami. Anderson's absence ended a streak of 25 straight games where Memphis used the same starting lineup: Anderson, Gasol, Conley, Garrett Temple and rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. Shelvin Mack started in Anderson's place. FIRST IMPRESSIONS Carter's debut drew nice reviews from Harden, particularly regarding the rookie's defense. ""He's very active. . He plays his butt off,"" Harden said. ""He is everywhere on the floor. He did an unbelievable job of pressing me and Chris up the floor, creating some defense to offense."" NON-TRADE TALK Friday night's three-team trade that never happened still was buzzing before the game. The Grizzlies' MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden were believed to be headed to Phoenix after the trade talks surfaced Friday night. Instead, confusion over whether the Grizzlies were including MarShon or Dillon Brooks killed the Memphis part of the deal, leading to a lot of talk on Saturday. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he apologized to the players. MarShon Brooks still expressed his confusion over the circumstances. His mother learned of the trade near the end of Friday's night's game with Miami, even trying to tell him of the report from her seat in the stands. ""It's a little awkward, you know. I'm a human,"" Brooks said. ""I've got feelings. I'm not just numb to the situation. ""I don't know how it happened. I guess (the general managers) were in a group text or something.""","401071113"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Chicago Bulls coach Jim Boylen proudly says he learned a lot from San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich during his two seasons as a Spurs assistant. Boylen even learned how to withstand a crisis and it helped him beat his mentor. Kris Dunn scored 24 points, Lauri Markkanen added 23 and the Bulls rallied from a 21-point deficit in the second half to stun the Spurs 98-93 on Saturday night. ""He has helped me grow as a coach and a man,"" Boylen said. ""In a strange way, he's got a lot to do with this, too."" A Spurs assistant from 2013-15, Boylen is 2-4 since replacing Fred Hoiberg as Chicago's coach. His early tenure includes the Bulls holding a players-only meeting to air their dislike for Boylen's no-nonsense style. But Boylen learned to be brutally honest and demand his team execute properly whether leading or trailing. Those instructions paid off Saturday. ""Coach Boylen had them ready and the character and fortitude they showed being down at half by 19 is a real tribute to what they are trying to establish in Chicago,"" Popovich said. The Bulls outscored the Spurs 55-31 in the second half, including a 13-4 run to close the game. The rally snapped Chicago's three-game skid and ended San Antonio's four-game winning streak. ""It shows a lot of heart from the team to climb back,"" Markkanen said. ""Obviously, it takes a lot of energy to dig yourselves a hole and then we've got to climb back up, but it shows what we can do. If we play like that as a team, we have a chance to beat anybody."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 29 points and 12 rebounds for San Antonio, which dominated the first half. DeMar DeRozan added 21 points. ""They're going out there and just playing,"" DeRozan said. ""When you play teams like that, they just go out there and play. They're not worried about losing. They just go out there and play hard."" Bobby Portis' nine-foot jumper with 1:39 remaining in the game gave Chicago its first lead since a pair of one-point advantages in the opening two minutes of the game. Dunn added six points in the final 40 seconds to complete the come-from-behind victory for a Bulls team that struggled to gain any momentum in the first half. ""My team believes in me and it was a good team win,"" Dunn said. Chicago committed only three turnovers in the second half, including just one in the fourth quarter when it outscored San Antonio 24-15. ""The key to the second half and the fourth quarter in general was our defense,"" Bulls point guard Ryan Arcidiacono said. Arcidiacono finished with 12 points and six assists. The Spurs led 62-43 entering the second half but promptly committed four turnovers in the opening two minutes of the third quarter. ""We were just a little bit more aggressive and we tuned in to the scouting report just a little bit more,"" Dunn said. ""But I thought in the first half we played good defense, too, they just made tough shots."" TIP-INS Bulls: Guard Zach LaVine did not travel with the Bulls, missing the game with an injured left ankle. ... Forward Jabari Parker was in uniform but did not play. Spurs: San Antonio guard Marco Belinelli, who finished with 12 points, made his first four 3-pointers and finished 4 of 5. Belinelli has twice made seven 3-pointers in a game this season, the most recent Nov. 19 at New Orleans. ... The Spurs entered the game shooting 83 percent on free throws, which would be the second-best total in league history if it stands. Boston set the league mark by shooting 83.2 percent in 1990. HOME SWEET HOME Boylen said it was very difficult to leave San Antonio to take another job in coaching, but he did keep a piece of his heart in the city. He still owns the house his family lived in when it was in San Antonio. ""I love San Antonio,"" Boylen said. ""My kids, my wife and I, we loved living here. I just couldn't sell it. It broke my heart to put it on the market, so we kept it. We leased it to a beautiful family. It's in a Cul-de-sac, there's a pool, it's just a safe place. It's hard to get rid of a safe place."" Boylen met the family who leased his home for the first time Friday. GASOL UPDATE Spurs center Pau Gasol missed his 21st straight game with a sore left foot and his return is unknown. ""There's no contact or competitive stuff at all,"" Popovich said. ""He's just shooting in place and that kind of thing. Seems like it's going to take a while.""","401071114"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George rendered the Los Angeles Clippers' traps and double-teams useless. Oklahoma City's forward shredded the Clippers for 33 points, seven rebounds and six assists in a 110-104 victory on Saturday night. ""I'm fine being trapped,"" George said. ""That's where we're going to need our guys the most -- for them to make plays out of it. Honestly, I think that's the easiest way for me to get myself going because I make those plays early. And we burn them, we hurt them on those plays. They can't trap me anymore. They put two on the ball, find the open guy."" George isn't just handling pressure, he's thriving in it. He made 11 of 19 shots against the Clippers and didn't have a turnover. ""He's great,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He's just so long, tough, plays at a great pace. Can't speed him up, really. He knows he's bigger than most of those guys that's guarding him, so when he's shooting the ball like that, he's tough."" It was the fourth time in seven December games George scored at least 30 points. He's averaging 29.1 points this month while shooting 52 percent from the field. Russell Westbrook had 13 points, 12 assists, nine rebounds and six steals for Oklahoma City. He made just 4 of 17 shots, yet he had a positive effect on his team. ""The hustle plays, diving on the floor, the deflections that he generated, and by being disciplined doing that -- it wasn't like he was running around helter skelter,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""He was really disciplined. I thought it was a game where, yeah he didn't shoot it great, but I'm not really worried about that. But what he did do was impact the game in a lot of other ways, which I think were important for us."" Jerami Grant scored 18 points and Steven Adams added 16 for the Thunder, who bounced back from a 109-98 loss at Denver on Friday night. Danilo Gallinari matched a season high with 28 points, Tobias Harris scored 22 and Montrezl Harrell added 21 for the Clippers. The Thunder led 61-50 at halftime, despite Westbrook going scoreless for almost 22 minutes to start the game. George picked up the slack with 21 points in the first half. Los Angeles' Patrick Beverley got called for a technical foul in the closing seconds of the third quarter, and George made the free throw to give the Thunder an 86-69 lead at the end of the period. Harrell scored, was fouled and made the free throw with just over a minute remaining to cut Oklahoma City's lead to six. With the margin still six, Harrell was fouled by Westbrook on a dunk attempt with 20.7 seconds left. He missed both free throws, and the Thunder called timeout. Oklahoma City got the ball inbounds, and George passed his way out of a trap to find Grant for a dunk that put the game out of reach. TIP-INS Clippers: G Lou Williams missed his third straight game with a sore left hamstring. ... C Marcin Gortat was called for a technical in the second quarter. ...

"PHOENIX --  Victories are rare for the Phoenix Suns. Winning streaks seem downright historic. Devin Booker returned from a six-game absence to score 28 points and Phoenix beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 107-99 on Saturday night, giving the Suns consecutive wins for the first time in almost a year. Deandre Ayton had 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Suns, including 10 points and five boards in the fourth quarter, when Phoenix pulled away. T.J. Warren added 21 points for Phoenix. After being sidelined with a strained hamstring, Booker returned to make 10 of 16 shots and added seven rebounds and seven assists in 36 minutes. ""Getting a win? It's fun,"" he said. ""I'm just having fun playing with high energy. Crowd's involved, fans are involved, playing good basketball. Nothing more than that I could ask for. Just going out there, playing the right way, playing together."" The Suns (6-24), coming off a victory over Dallas on Thursday, last won two in a row on Dec. 26-29, 2017. ""We never play in a game to lose,"" Phoenix first-year coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We play every quarter to win and give our best, everything we have. ... We are going to try to keep playing well, playing together as a team, and then anything happens after that."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 for the Timberwolves but only seven in the second half. ""We didn't make shots,"" he said. ""We didn't execute well throughout the game and our mistakes piled up at the end."" Derrick Rose added 25 for Minnesota, which finished 0-4 on a western road trip and is 2-12 on the road this season. ""We didn't come out with the urgency of a team that wanted to win the game,"" Rose said. ""I think that's how this game is played. You can't come out lackadaisical, you can't come out nonchalant. You've got to come out and play as hard as you can, especially when you've lost three in a row, and it shows. Tonight we lost four."" The Suns played without Trevor Ariza after agreeing to trade him to Washington for Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been announced by either team. Neither team led by more than six points in a tight first half that ended with Minnesota up 58-56. Booker, who had been out with a strained hamstring, scored the first four in a 6-0 spurt that gave the Suns an 85-77 lead with 1:20 left in the third quarter. Josh Jackson's dunk capped the spurt on a fast break after Mikal Bridges' block of Andrew Wiggins' shot. Dario Saric sank a 3 and Wiggins hit a 19-footer to cut the Suns' lead to 85-82 entering the final period. After Rose's basket to start the fourth quarter cut it to 85-84, Phoenix scored 11 straight, including Ayton's three-point play, to lead 96-84 on Warren's bank shot with 6:59 left. Rose scored five straight to make it a seven-point game but Ayton and Warren each scored inside and Minnesota never threatened seriously again. ""We didn't play good defense,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said, ""and then in the fourth quarter, we didn't make the right plays."" TRADE IN PROGRESS While the Suns wouldn't confirm the trade, Ariza was officially ""not with the team."" The deal is expected to be finalized on Monday, when the Suns are in New York to face the Knicks to start a six-game road trip. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Taj Gibson was out for personal reasons.

"NEW YORK --  Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson watched the Nets let a 21-point lead slip to two and was reminded of the offensive flaws that sent the team spiraling on an eight-game skid a few weeks ago. Needing a spark on the offensive end, Atkinson made sure D'Angelo Russell led the way. Russell scored 32 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 18 and the Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 144-127 on Sunday for their fifth straight win. Joe Harris had 16 points and Spencer Dinwiddie added 15 off the bench for the Nets, who last won five straight March 25-April 2, 2015. Atkinson noticed a different team to start the third quarter as the ball moved and the Nets pushed toward the basket more. ""I was worried at halftime. I said this game is too loose. It's too up and down,"" Atkinson said. ""They play fast, and we knew we had to start that third quarter with an edge, and I felt we did."" Atlanta cut Brooklyn's 21-point lead down to 66-64 when Kent Bazemore capped a 6-0 run with two free throws late in the first half. But the Nets pulled away in the third quarter with an 11-5 run to make it 108-92 after Russell found Ed Davis cutting to the basket for a dunk. Russell then found Jared Dudley for a 3 to extend the lead to 111-94 with 14 seconds left in the third, one of 34 assists by the Nets. That matched a season high set last Friday against Washington. ""I think just our commitment for wanting to see each other do better,"" said Russell, who finished with seven assists and no turnovers, becoming the first Net with that line since Vince Carter on March 19, 2008 against the Hawks. ""Like I said, everybody is aggressive at the appropriate time but still wanting to make that extra pass for the next guy, still having your teammates' back on the defensive end, that rotation,"" Russell added. ""We're making those plays."" Brooklyn also notched a season-high 12 steals. John Collins scored 29 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Hawks, who have lost three straight and seven of their last eight. Atlanta stumbled in the first quarter and trailed 42-23 at the end of it. The Hawks shot 10 for 23 from the field while the Nets connected on 16 of 26, including 7 for 14 from the 3-point line. ""It's all about figuring a way to get us going,"" said Bazemore, who finished with 20 points. The Hawks have lost their last five on the road, dropping to 2-14 away from home this season. TIP-INS Hawks: Rookie point guard Trey Young had 13 points and 10 assists. ... Atlanta had 38 assists on 47 baskets. Nets: The Nets had their highest scoring game ever at the Barclays Center, topping the 131 they scored against Philadelphia on March 15, 2016. ... Brooklyn has posted at least 70 points in the first half of its last two games, a feat it had not accomplished since the 1983-84 season. The Nets scored 70 points through two quarters against Washington on Friday and had 72 at the half against Atlanta. ... The Nets have scored at least 100 points through the first three quarters in consecutive games for the first time in franchise history. ...

BITTERSWEET RETURN Former Nets guard Jeremy Lin returned to Brooklyn and said he wished things had ended differently. Lin was surprised and upset with the trade that sent him to Atlanta on July 12 after two years and just 37 games in Brooklyn due to injuries. ""Honestly, coming in the building, just thankful,"" said Lin, who was averaging 10.8 points and 41 percent shooting from the 3-point line in 25 games. ""As sad as it is when I think of Brooklyn, obviously, I just think of a lot of injuries and things like that. It's quite a contrast to being healthy, being able to participate in a game.""","401071117"
"CLEVELAND -- Jimmy Butler's return brought out the best in his Philadelphia teammates. Ben Simmons had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists for his third triple-double of the season, Joel Embiid scored 24 points and the 76ers routed the Cleveland Cavaliers 128-105 on Sunday. Butler scored 19 points after missing two games -- both losses -- with a strained groin. ""He's such a large personality and his talent is sort of a spirit he brings to our group,"" coach Brett Brown said. Butler was 6-of-10 from the field and hit three 3-pointers. He gave Simmons most of the credit. ""Ben is doing what he always does for us, passing the ball,"" Butler said. ""When he's playing like that, the game is really easy for everybody."" Simmons had his 15th career triple-double. ""Having Jimmy back helped because we had multiple guys that could put it away,"" he said. ""I just do what I can offensively and help find guys who are scoring. Numbers are numbers. Obviously, stat-wise, it looks good."" Landry Shamet added 16 points for Philadelphia, J.J. Redick had 14 points and Wilson Chandler 11. Cedi Osman and Jordan Clarkson each scored 18 points for Cleveland. Rodney Hood and Matthew Dellavedova each had 13 points, and rookie point guard Collin Sexton added 12. Philadelphia broke it open after Cleveland cut a 13-point lead to 86-85 late in the third quarter. The Sixers led 86-73 midway through the quarter, but Cleveland scored 12 straight points and trailed by one after Larry Nance Jr.'s dunk. Chandler hit a 3-pointer from the corner as time ran out in the period, starting the deciding run. ""The margin for error in this game is very small for us,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""Margin for errors is not just a turnover -- it's a bad shot, it's not getting back defensively."" The Cavaliers led 44-34 early in the second quarter, but Philadelphia ended the first half on a 31-14 run. Butler was injured in the first quarter Monday against Detroit and went scoreless in 10 minutes. Philadelphia won that game but lost to Brooklyn and Indiana with Butler out. ""I felt good,"" he said. ""When you play with such good guys that draw so much attention, I have the easy job. I hang my hat on defense. I don't care how many shots I get or anything."" TOUGH MATCHUP Drew knows even trying to slow down Embiid is not an easy task. Not only is the 7-footer a dominant player in the lane, he also has hit 36 3-pointers this season. ""He's a force -- size, the ability to shoot it from the 3, the ability to take it off the dribble,"" Drew said. ""You don't see a guy that size being able to shoot the ball as well as he does from the 3. Where he's most deadly is when he's playing with his back to the basket. Just for his size alone, I don't think anybody can defend him one-on-one down low because he's just too big."" LONG TRIP The Sixers complete a challenging back-to-back set in San Antonio on Monday. Simmons was the only player to go more than 30 minutes as Brown made liberal use of his bench. ""I'm happy to get on a plane and know nobody played reckless minutes, and we got the win,"" Brown said. TIP-INS 76ers: Redick was limping after landing awkwardly while being fouled in the first quarter, but he remained in the game and played 28 minutes. ... Brown walked halfway on the floor to call timeout after Osman drove the length of the floor for an uncontested layup in the second quarter. Cavaliers: Hood picked up two fouls in the first 1:13 and went to the bench. ... Ante Zizic started at center after not playing in four straight games. Zizic and Nance each picked up two fouls in the first quarter trying to guard Embiid. ... Channing Frye, who started the previous two games in place of the injured Tristan Thompson, entered the game late in the period.","401071118"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo is getting close. Oladipo had his best outing since returning from a nagging right knee injury that kept him out of the lineup for 11 games, scoring 26 points Sunday as the Indiana Pacers beat the New York Knicks 110-99 for their seventh straight victory. The winner of the Most Improved Player award last season added eight rebounds, seven assists and a season-high five steals. The All-Star guard said he is nearly feeling 100 percent. ""I'm almost there,"" Oladipo said. ""I'm still trying to get my legs back under me. But I'm almost there."" Myles Turner added 24 points, six rebounds and two blocks. He also halted the Knicks' momentum on a fast break in the fourth quarter, sprinting across the court to disrupt Emmanuel Mudiay's layup attempt that would have cut the Pacers' lead to four points late in the game. The Pacers say plays like that symbolize their defensive focus. ""That's just our makeup. It's just something that's embedded in our heads. We know we have to be in our spots (on defense) to help our teammates,"" Darren Collison said. ""We're just caring about one another. Everybody's making the right plays, and really, it comes down to our defense. When we play defense the way we have been, we can do whatever we want on the offensive end."" Enes Kanter finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 19 points and Mudiay finished with 18. The Pacers led by as many as 10 in the first half, but only led 56-53 at halftime. It was tied at 81 with about 9 minutes remaining before Indiana scored seven straight points for an 88-81 lead. New York made a late run but the Pacers held on to improve to 20-10. ""We just stepped up our energy,"" Turner said. ""A team like (New York) tries to slow you down. We just had to create our own energy."" The Pacers led by as many as 10 in the first half, but only led 56-53 at halftime. It was tied at 81 with about 9 minutes remaining before Indiana scored seven straight points for an 88-81 lead. New York made a late run but the Pacers held on to improve to 20-10. Enes Kanter finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 19 points and Mudiay finished with 18. ""I feel like we competed,"" Mudiay said. ""(We) definitely showed a lot more effort. The main thing was getting us a chance in the first quarter, and that's what we went out there wanting to do, so we gave ourselves a chance. But it didn't come out the way we wanted."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kanter had his 20th double-double of the season. . Mudiay has scored in double figures in 12 of the last 16 games . New York fell to 5-12 on the road. Pacers: Lead the season series against New York 2-0. . The Pacers became the fourth team to reach the 20-win mark on the season. .

"WASHINGTON --  John Wall was at his attacking best: 40 points and 14 assists; one no-look, through-the-legs assist; one buzzer-beating rainbow step-back jumper. LeBron James was at his sluggish worst: a season-low 13 points on 5-of-16 shooting. So it made sense that Wall's reeling and undermanned Washington Wizards, amid so much losing and infighting and roster flux, would dominate James and his rising Los Angeles Lakers throughout a 128-110 victory Sunday night. ""We're a team that's built on energy and depth,"" James said. ""We didn't have either tonight."" A day after he and Lonzo Ball each registered a triple-double in a win at Charlotte, the four-time NBA MVP had six rebounds and three assists and sat out the fourth quarter of a lopsided laugher. ""We did a good job of making it a little difficult on him, showing him a lot of bodies, active hands,"" said Wizards guard Bradley Beal, who had 25 points and 12 rebounds. Wall said the key for Washington was its defensive effort, something often missing this season. ""Tried not to let LeBron get going,"" Wall said. ""He missed a couple easy shots he always makes. Didn't get a couple calls driving to the basket. ... It's one game, but we know he is who he is."" Nothing the Lakers tried to do to slow Wall worked as the Wizards emphatically ended a four-game losing streak, going up by as many as 18 in the first quarter and 27 in the third. ""Box-and-1. Triangle-and-2. I haven't seen that since high school,"" Wall said. James and the Lakers had been 5-1 in the second half of back-to-back sets this season, but they opened Sunday's game by going 5 for 19, 0 for 8 on 3s. Washington, meanwhile, made its first five shots and 13 of its first 18, taking a 26-8 lead on Wall's layup. Wall ended the first half with a baseline jumper over 7-foot-1 center Tyson Chandler to make it 71-51. Wall turned and slapped palms with a couple of front-row folks, then spread his arms wide and basked in the ovation from a home crowd populated by plenty of spectators in LA jerseys. ""I know all the Lakers fans out there probably was upset,"" Wall said, rolling his eyes. By then, Wall already had 28 points, outscoring LA's five starters -- James, Ball, Chandler, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart -- by six. Recently acquired reserve forward Sam Dekker scored a season-high 20 for Washington, including a buzzer-beating bank shot at the end of the third quarter that put the hosts ahead 99-76. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored a season-high 25 points for the Lakers, 15 in the second quarter. Washington was without starting center Dwight Howard, who had back surgery, and injured starting forward Otto Porter Jr., while a pair of players -- Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers -- were unavailable because they are on their way out of town via a trade that is still not officially complete. Didn't matter on this night, thanks in large part to Wall. ""When he gets going,"" Dekker said, ""it really sets the tone for us."" TIP-INS Lakers: Michael Beasley was back with the team, but didn't play, after being away for personal reasons. ... JaVale McGee missed the game with flu-like symptoms. ... A pair of sneakers James wore during a game at the Wizards a year ago Monday -- one black, one white, with the word ""equality"" in capital gold letters on the back of each -- was recently placed on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. ... Ball finished with 10 points, five rebounds and four assists. Wizards: The deal bringing Trevor Ariza to Washington from the Phoenix Suns is still not official, so Oubre and Rivers were listed as inactive Sunday because of ""trade pending."" ... Markieff Morris left at halftime because of a neck strain. ... Porter missed his third game in a row with a bruised knee. ... Jeff Green started in Porter's place and scored 20 points.","401071120"
"DALLAS --  The Sacramento Kings ended the Dallas Mavericks' home winning streak and spoiled Dirk Nowitzki's return to the American Airlines Center. More importantly for them, they found a way to close the deal after a stinging home loss. Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox each scored 28 points Sunday night in the Kings' 120-113 victory, which ended the Mavs' 11-game home winning streak. Coming off a loss to Golden State in which they blew a 10-point lead over the final three minutes, the Kings led for the entire second half and finished off Dallas behind some big plays late by Fox. ""We thought about the loss we just had,"" Fox said. ""We kind of had a similar lead at a similar time and we try not to make those same mistakes as we made against Golden State."" The 21-year veteran Nowitzki entered to a standing ovation late in the first quarter, scoring three points in eight minutes. He missed the first 26 games of the season while recovering from ankle surgery before playing six minutes at Phoenix on Thursday. Luka Doncic had 28 points and nine assists, but no other Dallas player scored more than 15 points. DeAndre Jordan tied his season high with 23 rebounds but Dallas was hampered by poor 3-point shooting, making only 9 of 35 (26 percent). Doncic played extended minutes as the team's primary ball handler with injuries to starting point guard Dennis Smith Jr. (right wrist sprain) and primary backup J.J. Barea (left ankle sprain) leaving Dallas short-handed at the position. ""We had a bad shooting night, which didn't help,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""But on those nights, your defense has got to keep you in it. And we just were unable to stay really, really close enough to give ourselves a chance."" Sacramento was also short-handed. Marvin Bagley III, the No. 2 pick in the draft, was out with a bone bruise on his left knee, and Kings teammate Iman Shumpert was a late scratch with a hip contusion. TIP-INS Kings: Bagley will be re-evaluated in 10 to 14 days. ... Yogi Ferrell had eight points in his first game against Dallas since he left the Mavericks as a free agent this summer. Mavericks: Carlisle said Smith's injured right wrist wasn't progressing as well as hoped despite Smith playing 27 minutes Thursday. ""He keeps falling on it,"" Carlisle said after the game. ""And when he falls, he generally falls from higher up than the rest of us."" ... Nowitzki was also denied a chance to become just the sixth player in NBA history to reach 900 wins. FOX TAKES OVER Dallas had closed within 98-91 midway through the fourth quarter when Fox outjumped Jordan, who is eight inches taller, for a defensive rebound, then coasted downcourt for a layup. Nemanja Bjelica then hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions for a 106-97 lead. Wesley Matthews' 3 with 1:46 to play pulled the Mavs to 112-107, but Fox dribbled out nearly the entire shot clock and drove the lane for layup. After a Dallas turnover, Fox fed Willie Cauley-Stein for a dunk to ice the game with 51 seconds left. ""We know we can't go anywhere without Fox because of his speed and his playmaking ability,"" Hield said. DIRK CHECKS IN Nowitzki entered with 3:17 remaining in the first quarter. He's the first player in NBA history to play 21 seasons with one team. Nowitzki missed his first three shots from the field but scored his first point on a technical foul shot with 7:48 to go in the second quarter, then nailed a short jumper eight seconds later. ""I appreciate the warm welcome,"" Nowitzki said. ""This obviously took a lot longer than I was hoping myself. I wish I was out there a long, long time ago. I'm finally there and moving in the right direction.""","401071121"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Dwyane Wade fondly remembers his dominant first game in New Orleans as an emerging college star with Marquette. He won't forget what was likely his final performance as a pro in the Big Easy, either. Wade walked off the court to chants of ""D-Wade! D-Wade!"" from fans converging on the tunnel to the visitors' locker room after his 19 points -- highlighted by tough shots over Anthony Davis at the end of each half -- helped the Miami Heat beat the Pelicans 102-96 on Sunday night. Wade, who turns 37 in January and plans to retire after this season, said the efforts of fans around the country to see him play one last time is ""definitely not lost on me."" So when a sore back sidelined him for Miami's previous game at Memphis, he was determined to do what he could to loosen up in time to give it a go in New Orleans. ""I definitely understand the sacrifices people make to be at our games,"" Wade said. ""I just wanted to make sure tonight I was able to get out there. And then I started feeling pretty good as it went on, got a couple shots to fall and the rest is history."" Wade received an enthusiastic ovation when he first checked in and then made his first three 3-point attempts, the last of which he banked in with Davis guarding him closely in the final seconds of the first half. Wade stopped short of saying he meant to use the glass, but recalled thinking that was the only chance the shot had to fall when he released the ball over Davis' long arms. ""I decided to ask God to put it in for me -- just prayed on it,"" Wade said with a laugh. The Pelicans were as close as 96-90 after Davis' 3 with 2:32 to go. But Miami, which led nearly the entire game -- and by as much as 17 -- squashed any hope of a late comeback with Wade's driving floater over Davis to make it 100-92 with 51 seconds left. Wary of the pressure Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday was putting on Heat ball handlers, Wade said he acted decisively to explode past Holiday toward the hoop. ""And then when I got down there I saw the big fella coming, so the only chance I had to get the shot off, I had to throw it high, kind of like the 3, but just in the paint,"" Wade said. ""It was kind of the icing on the cake."" Josh Richardson scored 22 points for Miami, which closed out a six-game road swing with its fourth victory on the trip. Hassan Whiteside had 17 points and 12 rebounds in his matchup with Davis. Davis had 27 points, 12 rebounds, three blocks and three steals, but curiously did not take his first shot of the second half until hitting a 3-pointer with 5:43 left in the fourth quarter. ""Every time he got the ball they were running two guys at him. Once again, A.D. is not going to force shots,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""He did what he was supposed to do and he had seven assists -- probably could have easily had double figures. We did not make some (open) shots."" Both teams shot worse than 42 percent and Miami missed 25 3s, but the difference in the game was Miami's rebounding. The Heat outrebounded the Pelicans 57-38, pulling down 22 offensive rebounds and converting them into 25 second-chance points Tyler Johnson added 15 points off the bench for Miami, whose reserves outscored New Orleans' bench 58-20. Julius Randle had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, but limped to the locker room with 6:49 to go after rolling his right ankle during a lost scrap for a rebound. Holiday had 22 points. TIP-INS Heat: Reserve wing player Derrick Jones Jr. scored 11 points in 21 minutes. ... Guard Goran Dragic sat out for the fourth time in five games with right knee soreness. ... Starting forward Justise Winslow left the game in the first half with right ankle soreness and did not return. Pelicans: Forward Nikola Mirotic missed his second straight game with a right ankle injury. ... Forward Darius Miller missed eight of nine shots, including seven of eight from 3-point range, where he normally hits 38 percent. MEMORIES Wade said Marquette's visit to Tulane in January 2003 was the first time he was aware of NBA scouts in attendance for one of his games. He scored 35 points in an 85-73 win. He returned to New Orleans that season for the Final Four in the Superdome. Then as an NBA rookie, his first playoff series was against New Orleans, which was then in the Eastern Conference, and Miami won that series. ""I've had a lot of great moments here,"" Wade said. ""I was glad I was able to get out there today and kind of finish it off the last time being here.""","401071122"
"DENVER --  In the fourth quarter, Jamal Murray's shot finally started falling. ""About time,"" the Denver guard said. About time, too, to take the Nuggets as a serious, pesky threat. Nikola Jokic scored 26 points, Murray had 15 of his 19 in the fourth quarter and the banged-up Nuggets rallied past the equally banged-up Toronto Raptors 95-86 on Sunday night in a contest between conference leaders. Trailing 70-57 in the third quarter, the Nuggets went on a 23-2 run to send them to their 10th win in 12 games and retain a slim lead over Golden State in the Western Conference. This marks the latest the Nuggets (20-9) have been in first place in the West since Dec. 18, 1984, according to information by Elias Sports Bureau. ""It's December,"" Mason Plumlee said. ""It's a long way to go."" Still, they've now beaten the Raptors (twice), Golden State and Boston. ""I guess maybe it says we're the best team for the time being,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""There are a lot of games left. I think one thing we've done a really good job of is tempering our own excitement."" Kawhi Leonard had 29 points and 14 rebounds for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who finished 2-2 on their trip. They still own the league's best mark at 23-9. Murray led the charge with eight straight points early in the fourth. The defense stepped up, too, as the Raptors didn't score their first field goal in the final quarter until Leonard's dunk with 7:42 remaining. Toronto pulled to 86-83 with 3:28 left, but Plumlee's easy bucket gave Denver some breathing room. The Raptors were 4 of 23 from the field in the fourth quarter, including 1 of 13 from 3-point land. More alarming to Raptors coach Nick Nurse was that Leonard only had four free throws despite all his work around the rim. ""You can't tell me one of the best players in the league takes a hundred hits in that game and shoots four free throws,"" Nurse said. ""It's been going on all year. I do not understand why they are letting everybody play one of the best players in the league so physically. I do not understand."" Leonard agreed, but shrugged it off. ""It's been very physical. I just go with the next play,"" Leonard said. ""I pride myself on just keep moving and keep going."" Both teams had several key players on the bench due to injuries. The Raptors were without Kyle Lowry (thigh), Pascal Siakam (back), Fred VanVleet (back) and Jonas Valanciunas (thumb). The Nuggets didn't have Will Barton (right hip/core muscle surgery), Gary Harris (hip) and Paul Millsap (big toe). Not that Malone gave it much thought. ""Teams look at us right now with players out, and they think they can show up and beat us,"" Malone said. ""We've shown teams, `No, that's not the case.' We have more than enough players that are going to go out there and battle and compete."" The Nuggets beat the Raptors 106-103 on Dec. 3 in Toronto. In that game, Jokic had 23 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds. Jokic was a handful again. He also had nine rebounds. ""He's doing what he's supposed to do,"" Malone said. ""He's our franchise player."" TIP-INS Raptors: Danny Green was given a technical foul in the third quarter. He was poked in the eye by Monte Morris early in the fourth quarter. ... C Serge Ibaka fouled out with 1:37 remaining. He was given a technical after the call. ... Delon Wright got the start and had 15 points. Nuggets: Plumlee had 10 points and seven rebounds. INJURY UPDATE, PART I Barton could return to the lineup in the next week or 10 days. He had surgery on Oct. 23 to repair core and hip muscle injuries. ""It would be great to have him back,"" Malone said. ""He's such a versatile part of what we do."" INJURY UPDATE, PART II Nurse doesn't expect Lowry or Siakam to miss much time. Lowry sat out his second game with a bruised thigh, while Siakam was sidelined after experiencing back stiffness following a hard fall in Portland. ""There's nothing seriously wrong with either one of them,"" Nurse said. ""There's just some soreness.""","401071123"
"DETROIT --  Giannis Antetokounmpo was called for two quick fouls, and with 9:02 remaining in the first quarter, he went to the bench. When he returned, there was still plenty of time for the Milwaukee star to make an impact. ""No matter how many fouls I have, I've got to be aggressive. If I get the third one, I get the third one,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Whenever I stop being aggressive, I don't make plays."" Antetokounmpo made plenty of plays down the stretch, finishing with 32 points and 12 rebounds, and the Bucks held on for a 107-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night when Blake Griffin missed a last-second 3-pointer. Griffin actually missed two 3s in the final 14 seconds. The Detroit star already had a triple-double after three quarters, but it was a difficult fourth for him. Griffin finished with 19 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, but he also had 10 turnovers. ""We're not going to win games by 10 turnovers and by making the poor decisions like I did down the stretch,"" Griffin said. ""I feel bad for these guys because they played so hard and got us back in this game. I wasn't there for them tonight."" The Pistons rallied from a 15-point, third-quarter deficit and took an 89-86 lead in the fourth when Stanley Johnson connected from 3-point range. Milwaukee was up 100-99 when Eric Bledsoe of the Bucks missed three straight free throws -- but Antetokounmpo briefly took over after that. Antetokounmpo put Milwaukee up by three with a dunk, then added a three-point play and another dunk to make it 107-100. The Pistons rallied and had the ball with a chance to tie. Griffin missed from beyond the arc, and after Jose Calderon came up with an offensive rebound, Griffin missed again. ""I was unbelievably awful tonight,"" Griffin said. ""I thought we had a chance to tie it tonight despite everything I did."" TIP-INS Bucks: Khris Middleton scored 22 points and Bledsoe added 17. ... Antetokounmpo actually played 6:03 in the first quarter despite the early fouls. He played 31:11 for the game. Pistons: Andre Drummond had only 10 points to go along with his 14 rebounds and had a dunk attempt blocked by Antetokounmpo late in the first. ... Reggie Bullock scored 10 points in the first quarter and finished with a team-high 24. INJURIES Milwaukee was without guard Malcolm Brogdon for a second straight game because of left hamstring soreness. Ersan Ilyasova also missed the game for the Bucks with a nose contusion. The Pistons were without guard Ish Smith (right adductor tear), forward Glenn Robinson III (left ankle sprain) and forward Henry Ellenson (left ankle sprain). IN RESERVE D.J. Wilson, a second-year player for Milwaukee who played college basketball at nearby Michigan, came back from a G League assignment and scored a career-high nine points. Sterling Brown also scored nine points off the bench. ""They were huge,"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said. ""Having that kind of energy from the young fellows and having them come out with that kind of confidence, especially defensively, it's so big time. It was great that they were ready for that opportunity."" BIG QUARTER Johnson finished with 20 points for the Pistons and made four 3-pointers, all in the fourth period. ""I thought the second unit came in and played with energy and played hard,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""They got us back into the game.""","401071124"
"NEW YORK --  A 4-24 record didn't discourage the Phoenix Suns, so a seven-point halftime deficit certainly wouldn't. The young Suns wiped away the second one, and insist they'll keep chipping away at the first. ""We're building,"" guard Devin Booker said. ""We're getting better every game."" Booker tied his season high with 38 points, T.J. Warren scored 17 of his 26 during Phoenix's 41-point third quarter and the Suns beat the New York Knicks 128-110 on Monday night for their third straight victory. Phoenix outscored New York 41-17 in the third and went on to win three consecutive games for the first time since March 2-5, 2017. The Suns won only four times in their first 28 games, but are 3 for 3 since. Deandre Ayton finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds for the Suns in an impressive start to a five-game road trip, their longest of the season. Jamal Crawford had a career-high 14 assists as last-place Phoenix improved to 2-13 away from home, toughening up in the second half after giving up 12 offensive rebounds in the first. ""Whatever it was, it was a completely different team in the second half,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We saw two different teams, understanding that if we rebound the ball we're going to win the game."" Booker just returned Saturday from a six-game absence with a left hamstring strain and scored 28 points against Minnesota. He was even better with a game under his belt, hurting the Knicks not only with his perimeter shooting but also by going 14 of 15 at the free throw line and grabbing seven rebounds. Emmanuel Mudiay had 32 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Knicks, who lost for the seventh time in eight games. Rookie forward Kevin Knox scored 17. ""We were up in the first half and at halftime I think we got a little relaxed and thought the game was over and they were going to roll over for us,"" said Knox, who had just four points in the second half. ""But, that's not what happened."" New York played without leading scorer Tim Hardaway Jr. because of a sore right heel. Mudiay came in averaging 18.5 points in his last eight games and was just about there by halftime, with 18 points. Knox had 13 and the Knicks were ahead 66-59. Things changed quickly in the third quarter, when the Suns went 16 of 22 from the field -- with one of the misses being a halfcourt heave as the buzzer sounded. The game was tied at 79 after Mudiay's layup but Warren nailed a long 3-pointer to ignite a 21-4 finish to the period. Warren had another 3 later in the run, and Crawford hit a couple of jumpers and had four assists, including an alley-oop pass to Richaun Holmes. ""The water was coming through the dam through so many holes,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""We didn't show a lot of toughness during that run."" With their 100-83 lead, the Suns kept up the pressure early in the fourth and quickly put the game out of reach. TIP-INS Suns: Josh Jackson scored 14 points and Holmes had 13. ... Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers were not with the team after their acquisition from Washington became official earlier Monday. The Wizards agreed to send them to Phoenix on Saturday for Trevor Ariza. Knicks: Veteran guard Courtney Lee started for Hardaway in just his seventh game of the season. Lee was out when the season began because of a neck injury. ... The Knicks played without rookies Allonzo Trier (strained left hamstring) and Mitchell Robinson (sprained left ankle). Trier's absence prevented him from facing Ayton, his former Arizona teammate. JAMAL'S BALL Ayton said the Suns gave the game ball to the 38-year-old Crawford, whose previous best was 12 assists. Crawford is far better known as a scorer and volume shooter. But he noted he was a point guard in high school, college and the early part of his NBA career before he became a three-time winner of the Sixth Man Award. ""I think especially for me, I'm known as such a scorer, and I can score -- like, I really can score -- but sometimes the defense thinks that, too, and they fall asleep and I see guys,"" Crawford said.","401071125"
"HOUSTON --  Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni has witnessed James Harden have the only 60-point triple-double in NBA history, lead Houston to the Western Conference finals and win his first MVP award. But what Harden has done for the previously underperforming Rockets in the last three games has topped anything the veteran coach has seen from his superstar player. ""I know he's the MVP and everything, but this level the last three or four games is where it's really high,"" D'Antoni said. ""It's as good as he's ever played."" Harden scored 47 points to help the Rockets hold off the Utah Jazz 102-97 on Monday night for their fourth straight win. It was Houston's first victory over the Jazz this season after dropping the first two meetings. The team's current winning streak comes following a three-game skid. Monday's performance came after Harden had 50 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in a win over the Lakers on Thursday and another triple-double of 32 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in Saturday's win at Memphis. ""He's the best offensive player I've ever seen -- like, seriously,"" teammate Chris Paul said. ""He can drive. He can shoot. He's got ballhandling, so it's going to be a tough night for you, whoever it is. I don't care what you're doing."" Houston led by double digits early in the fourth quarter, but poor shooting left the Rockets tied with about two minutes left. A 3-pointer by Harden put Houston back on top and he added two free throws with about a minute remaining to make it 99-94. Donovan Mitchell was fouled by Eric Gordon on a 3-pointer and made all three free throws to cut the lead to two with 35 seconds left. Then, under heavy pressure from Ricky Rubio, Harden stepped back and hit a 3 to make it 102-97 with 13.3 seconds left, securing the victory. Harden brushed off talk of his recent dominance, insisting that it's something he has to do with the Rockets (15-14) in 10th place in the Western Conference. ""We're in a hole,"" he said. ""I keep saying the same thing, but if you look at the standings it (stinks) to look and see you're not where you're supposed to be. We just continue to work and build our way up there."" Mitchell had 23 points for the Jazz, who have lost four of five. ""We had a hard time scoring for a while, and that was about the same time we weren't close enough to (Harden), and he rose up and hit a big 3 and made a series of plays,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. Harden, who hit 15 of 16 free throws, had six rebounds, five assists and five steals. ""He's been getting really hot the last week, playing really aggressive, and we let him get to the free throw line, which was one of the things that we were talking about trying to avoid,"" Rubio said. The Rockets had a 10-point lead after three periods and Harden put them up by 11 on a 3-pointer with about nine minutes left in the fourth. Mitchell had a nifty spinning layup before the Rockets missed five shots over their next two possessions and Danuel House turned it over the next time down. Mitchell's layup started a 9-0 run for the Jazz, capped by a 3 from Rubio that got them to 90-88 with about 5 1/2 minutes left. Harden scored Houston's first points in more than 3 1/2 minutes after that, and things between him and Rudy Gobert got a little testy after that. Gobert fouled Harden as he dribbled down the court and Harden approached Gobert after the call. There was some minor pushing between the two before Harden walked away. The Rockets led by 13 at halftime but Utah opened the third quarter with a 12-2 run to get to 52-49 with about 8 1/2 minutes left in the period. Utah used a 7-0 spurt later in the quarter to take a 58-57 lead. But Harden took over after that, scoring all of Houston's points in a 9-2 run that gave the Rockets a six-point lead with about 5 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. Harden converted three-point plays on consecutive possessions before hitting a 3 after a turnover by Jae Crowder. Houston was up by four about a minute later when Harden sailed over the 7-foot-1 Gobert for a one-handed dunk before a 3-pointer by P.J. Tucker made it 73-64. Snyder was handed a technical after that for yelling at the officials, and Harden made the free throw. TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert had 18 points and 13 rebounds. ... The Jazz had 23 turnovers. ... Crowder finished with 14 points. Rockets: Waived F/C Zhou Qi. ... James Ennis missed his third straight game with a strained right hamstring and D'Antoni said Ennis could be out as long as two weeks. ... Brandon Knight had three points and a rebound in his third game back after missing last season while recovering from knee surgery. ... Paul had 11 points and nine assists. THEY SAID IT Harden on his one-handed dunk over Gobert : ""I still got some juice in these legs. For you bigs out there that want to keep testing (me),"" Harden said before cracking up. ""Nah, I'm just playing. The lane was open all night. The bigs were going back, taking away the lob, taking away the lob, so I had to get to the rim and finish.""","401071126"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns got the Minnesota Timberwolves started and then enjoyed watching rookie Josh Okogie and the bench deliver the big blow. Towns had 14 points and 14 assists in just 21 minutes, Andrew Wiggins scored 17 and the Timberwolves beat the road-weary Sacramento Kings 132-105 on Monday night. ""You know, he comes off playing the way he played tonight, it makes all of us energized,"" Towns said about Okogie. ""Everyone has that guy that brings the best out of everyone, and Josh is that guy for us. When he comes in the game and plays that way every single time, it reinvigorates all of us."" Derrick Rose added 13 points and a season-high 11 assists while starting for injured point guard Jeff Teague. Minnesota led by 36 in the first half against Sacramento, which was coming off a 120-113 victory at Dallas a night earlier. The Timberwolves returned home following an 0-4 trip, including a 141-130 loss at Sacramento. ""You're always worried when you have a lead like that is sustaining your effort, and you're especially concerned with a team like that that shoots 3s the way they do,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We were fortunate to work our way out of that and then I was very pleased with our bench."" Kings coach Dave Joerger had a different reason to turn to his reserves. Sacramento was playing for the third time in four nights with travel, and then trailed big early. Buddy Hield scored 21 points for the Kings but didn't play in the second half. Joerger didn't play any of his starters after halftime. ""I think that's one thing we're working on as a young team, learning how to play on back-to-backs and finding that energy from somewhere,"" forward Skal Labissiere said. ""We've been struggling with that this whole year. I think as we mature, we'll figure it out."" Minnesota had a double-digit lead less than three minutes into the game. Hield tried to rally the Kings, scoring 16 of their first 17 points and hitting his first four 3-pointer before the Wolves' bench took over. Keyed by Okogie and Gorgui Dieng, Minnesota started the second quarter on a 25-5 run. Dieng scored seven of his season-high 15 points during the outburst, but it was the energetic rookie Okogie that had the Timberwolves and their fans celebrating. Okogie, drafted 20th this year out of Georgia Tech, finished with 10 points, three rebounds and three assists. ""I'm always in the gym working on different things, working on different ways to impact the game,"" Okogie said. ""Sometimes I play, sometimes I don't. When I do play, I'm going to do anything I can to help my team win."" Sacramento's reserves used a 21-3 spurt at the start of the second half to cut the deficit to 12. ""I commend those guys for going out there, being professional, playing hard and taking the minutes,"" Joerger said. ""We got off to a slow start, and I didn't think putting those guys back in was going to be worth it."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento starters De'Aaron Fox, Willie Cauley-Stein and Nemanja Bjelica all played fewer than 10 minutes. Fox, who entered averaging 18.5 points and 7.5 assists per game, was held scoreless on 0-of-4 shooting and didn't have an assist. ... The bench scored a season-high 78 points. ... Iman Shumpert missed the game due to personal reasons. Timberwolves: Teague missed the game with left ankle inflammation. Thibodeau said there was no specific injury, but the inflammation built up over time. ... The Timberwolves set a franchise record with nine players scoring in double figures. ... Minnesota had a season-high 37 assists on 48 made shots. ... The Wolves outscored Sacramento 66-36 in the paint. NO CONTROVERSY HERE Joerger addressed the backlash following his comments about Dallas rookie Luka Doncic a day earlier. Joerger complimented Doncic, saying he has no ceiling. Some took Joerger's quotes as displeasure at general manager Vlade Divac drafting Marvin Bagley III ahead of Doncic in the draft. ""In this case, all we were trying to do was say something positive about another team's player,"" Joerger said. ""There's no veiled shots at anybody. ... It was just a form of positivity and people try to turn it into something between Vlade and I."" Bagley missed his second straight game with a left knee bone bruise. Joerger spoke highly of his developing rookie big man before the game. ""When we drafted Marvin at 2, we were high-fiving like crazy,"" Joerger said. ""We got the right guy for us. Where we're going to be, this isn't going to be a story in three days. It's going to be definitely buried in five years from now when we've got the next Durant, Westbrook. That's how good they're going to be.""","401071127"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George's performance late in the first half was all the Oklahoma City Thunder needed against Chicago Bulls. George scored 16 of his game-high 24 points in the final five minutes of the first half and the Thunder rolled to a 121-96 victory over the Bulls on Monday night in a chippy game in which both teams were assessed technical fouls following a second-quarter fracas. ""I did my work early,"" George said. George's scoring outburst came in the final 4:47 of the second quarter as Oklahoma City outscored the Bulls 23-7 and built a 64-44 lead by the break. Outside of that nearly five-minute stretch, he shot 2 of 13 from the floor and scored just one point in the second half. ""I thought he was unbelievable tonight and he had an incredible first half,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said of George. The Bulls changed their defensive strategy against George after halftime, leading to fewer opportunities. Donovan said he was as impressed with George's performance outside of his big scoring stretch as he was with the stint to end the half. ""Here he goes crazy on that run in the first half . they elect to trap him in the second half. What does he do? He just facilitates. He gets other guys involved,"" Donovan said. ""It speaks to his greatness. He could have had a bigger scoring night, but I thought his playmaking, his facilitating and reading the game was really positive for us."" Russell Westbrook had 13 points, 16 rebounds and 11 steals for his 111th career triple-double. Steven Adams added 19 points and Dennis Schroder scored 18 for the Thunder. Lauri Markkanen and Bobby Portis had 16 points apiece to lead Chicago. Markkanen adding 15 rebounds. Westbrook secured the triple-double by threading a pass in the lane to a driving Hamidou Diallo, who finished with a reverse layup as he was knocked to the court and fouled with just over six minutes remaining. ""Russell's been great,"" Donovan said. ""It speaks to his greatness as a player that he can see what the team needs and from there, facilitate, so to speak. He's generating shots for Paul (George), he's generating shots for Steven (Adams). When he and Dennis (Schroder) are out there, they're both creating."" The Thunder sped into the lead with a 21-3 run that erased a 15-10 deficit. But the Bulls quickly reeled off a 19-8 run of their own and closed the gap to two points. From there, the Thunder took control, building a comfortable lead thanks to George's 6-for-6 shooting to close to the half. The game was halted for several minutes with 4:27 left in the second quarter after a melee broke out near the Thunder bench when Chicago's Cameron Payne fouled Terrance Ferguson and, nearly simultaneously, Westbrook and Kris Dunn exchanged pushes. The confrontation ended when Bulls coach Jim Boylen pulled Thunder forward Jerami Grant out of the scuffle by his neck. ""I don't know what really happened to be honest,"" Dunn said. ""Things just got out of hand."" When it was all said and done -- after a several-minute delay for review -- Westbrook, Grant, Dunn and Chicago's Robin Lopez were assessed technical fouls. Lopez wound up in the front row between the bench and the scorer's table as several people restrained him. ""I was just trying to stand up for (Dunn),"" he said. ""I saw somebody fly in out of the corner of my eye from the other side of the floor. I was just trying to stand up for my point guard right there. ""I felt kind of like I got twisted or flipped a little bit. Somehow, I ended up on that bench there. And then, I don't know. After that, something happened."" Lopez was ejected less than three minutes later after he picked up another technical foul. Boylen downplayed the scuffle after the game -- except as it pertained to the fight he saw from his team. ""That's all we've been talking about is fighting for each other and we talk about being a pack of wolves,"" Boylen said. ""I thought we had some of that. I liked the look in our guys' eyes when that happened. It bonded them a little bit."" But Boylen said his interactions with Grant weren't serious, saying that he was just trying to break up the altercation. ""It's really not that big a deal,"" Boylen said. ""Those things used to happen all the time, now they happen and it's a major deal. ""It's not that big a deal. Everybody moved on."" Grant said he wasn't concerned about the opposing coach pulling him out of the fray. ""He's trying to protect his team,"" Grant said. TIP-INS Bulls: Lauri Markkanen had 16 points and 15 rebounds, his first career 15/15 game. ... Jabari Parker, who didn't play in Saturday's win over San Antonio after falling out of the rotation, missed the game with a stomach illness. . The Bulls turned the ball over 11 times in the first half. . Robin Lopez's ejection with two third-quarter technicals was the ninth of his career and the first of this season.

Donovan is in his fourth season with Oklahoma City, going 169-106, with playoff appearances in his first three seasons. ""I'm grateful, appreciative and thankful for Mr. (Clay) Bennett and Sam (Presti),"" Donovan said before the game, referencing the Thunder's chairman and general manager.

"SAN ANTONIO --  While the San Antonio Spurs search for their identity as a team, Rudy Gay is showing that he has returned to form. Gay had 21 points and LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan each added 20 as San Antonio defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 123-96 on Monday night. ""I think we're starting to figure out each other more than anything,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Who's got the mismatches out there. Usually your best players look for those mismatches and our guys are starting to figure that out. Defensively, we've got a little bit more rhyme and reason to what we're doing and it's shown in this homestand. I'm pleased with the progress (but) we still have a long way to go."" Aldridge added 10 rebounds and DeRozan had seven assists for the Spurs, who closed a six-game home stand at 5-1. San Antonio bounced back after squandering a 21-point lead in a loss to Chicago on Saturday night. It was the fifth straight game the Spurs held an opponent under 100 points. J.J. Redick and Ben Simmons each had 16 points to lead the 76ers on the second night of a back-to-back. Joel Embiid was limited to 13 points on 6-for-17 shooting and finished with 11 rebounds. Jimmy Butler had six points on 3-for-13 shooting. Philadelphia shot 41 percent from the field and 30 percent on 3-pointers in losing for the third time in four outings. ""Defensively, they put us in tough situations to execute our offense,"" Embiid said. ""I had a pretty bad shooting night, Jimmy did (too). They made us uncomfortable."" When the Spurs' lead over the 76ers swelled to 29 points, Popovich didn't need to remind his team about the Bulls' rally. ""There was nothing to say, we were engaged,"" Gay said. ""We were really engaged. I think it was pretty clear that we messed up last game, we let that one go. Two games in a row? Can't happen. Can't happen."" Gay was key to the Spurs maintaining the lead. The 13-year veteran took advantage of mismatches when he wasn't outworking Butler. Gay had 11 points in the third as he continued his solid play in his comeback from a ruptured left Achilles tendon two years ago. The 6-foot-8 forward is averaging 14 points this season, but has averaged 18.8 points in his last seven games. ""He's got a little spunk in his step,"" Popovich said. ""He likes the group. He's worked hard to understand defensively and rebounding what we want and, of course, he can score."" Gay has scored 20-plus points five times through 27 games. He accomplished that feat in 57 games last season. Philadelphia raced to a nine-point lead in the opening quarter behind Redick's outside shooting and Embiid's inside dominance. The duo combined to shoot 8 for 13 and scored nine points apiece in the first quarter, including a 3-pointer by Redick and a dunk by Embiid. The Spurs rallied by limiting the 76ers to eight field goals and 17 points in the second quarter, and by forcing five turnovers. ""You can talk about Xs and Os, you can talk about a bunch of stuff but to me, our spirit was down,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We are poor in back- to-backs. That is a fact and we have to find a way to do better."" TIP-INS 76ers: Brown and assistant Monty Williams worked for the Spurs prior to joining Philadelphia. Brown spent 11 seasons as an assistant under Popovich from 2002-2013. Williams played for the Spurs from 1996-98 and returned to serve as vice president of basketball operations from 2016-18. ... Embiid led the team in scoring in four straight games prior to Monday, averaging 30.3 points over that stretch. Spurs: The Spurs held the 76ers to 17 points in the second quarter, which was two points shy of their season low of 15 for the period at Phoenix on Oct. 31. ... Davis Bertans had 16 points, the most in four games since a two-game absence following the birth of his first child. ... San Antonio's bench outscored Philadelphia's 56-35. HUMBLED Popovich spoke of his admiration for Butler, who he is expected to coach on the U.S. Men's Basketball Team in the 2020 Olympics. ""The one thing that stands out to me is he's a competitor,"" Popovich said. ""I love competitors, and he's that in spades. And he's obviously talented."" Butler was humbled by Popovich's assessment. ""All he wants to ever do is win, but a great guy,"" Butler said. ""He knows the human aspect of the game as well. For him to say that about me, it means a lot. It means I've just got to keep doing what I'm doing."" CATCHING UP Brown spent time with former Spurs Tim Duncan and Bruce Bowen, who he coached in San Antonio, prior to Monday's game. ""We had a laugh talking about old times,"" Brown said. ""It touched on basketball, but it was way more just catching up with them and seeing how they're doing personally.""","401071129"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry missed his first three tries from deep, got a little frustrated and forgot about the 10 points he needed for another major milestone. Curry had 20 points and seven rebounds while adding another accomplishment to his long list, leading the Golden State Warriors past the Memphis Grizzlies 110-93 on Monday night. Curry became just the fifth player in Warriors history to score 15,000 points during the regular season -- joining the company of Wilt Chamberlain, Rick Barry, Paul Arizin and Chris Mullin.

This marked Memphis' final visit to Oracle Arena before the Warriors move to new Chase Center in San Francisco next season. Omri Casspi added a season-high 20 points against his former team.

"LOS ANGELES --  The Trail Blazers cruised to a 15-point lead in the first quarter and were up by 18 early in the fourth. Then things got wild. They withstood a late rally by the Clippers to win 131-127 on Monday night after Damian Lillard scored 22 of his 39 points in a dominant third period. It was Portland's first win on the road since Nov. 20 after dropping six in a row. ""We've had a rough stretch lately and we've let a few games slip away, so it was really important that we win, especially on the road,"" Lillard said. The fourth quarter featured 36 free throws. Portland got outscored 39-31. The Clippers chipped away and pulled to 125-123 after Tobias Harris hit three of four free throws. CJ McCollum's jumper kept Portland ahead 127-123. Danilo Gallinari, who finished with 22 points, missed a 3-pointer, but after a scramble got the ball back and made the same shot to leave the Clippers trailing 127-126. McCollum got fouled and made both to keep the Trail Blazers ahead by three. The Clippers were forced to foul Lillard, who hit both free throws to seal the win. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 3-pointer in the final seconds missed. ""Our fourth quarter was terrible but we made big shots down the stretch,"" said McCollum, who had 27 points. Lillard hit five of his six 3-pointers in the third when the Blazers outscored the Clippers 42-28. Portland was 10 of 20 from 3-point range in the game. Harris matched Lillard with a career-high 39 points and rookie Gilgeous-Alexander added a career-best 24 for the Clippers, who have lost four in a row for the first time this season. ""We've got to start with the defensive end and picking up our physicality,"" Harris said. ""We've got to be a little more locked in."" Los Angeles trailed by 15 in the first quarter but erased the deficit in the second when the Clippers took their first lead, only to fall behind by 15 again in the third. Lillard's fifth 3 left the Clippers down 95-80. Portland made seven 3s in the period and stretched its lead to 18 points early in the fourth. ""He's coming out making 3s off screen-and-rolls, tough shots,"" Harris said. The Trail Blazers set the tone in the opening quarter when they began the game on a 33-18 run while shooting 80 percent from the floor. ""These head-to-head Western Conference games are all so important, especially since we are so close in the standings,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Stotts recorded his 289th victory and is two from tying Rick Adelman for second on the team's all-time coaching wins list. ... The Blazers have won five of their last six against the Clippers. Clippers: Montrezl Harrell committed a flagrant-2 foul in the fourth and was ejected. ...

They also hit 51 percent at Oklahoma City before losing by six points. ""We're still scoring but it's still hard without Lou,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""We miss his playmaking."" NO CALL Gallinari appeared to get fouled on a 3-point attempt with the Clippers down three but the referees didn't call anything. Lillard got around Patrick Beverley's pesky defense for a layup on the next play to extend Portland's lead to 125-120. ""I saw a foul. I think the whole arena saw a foul,"" Rivers said. ""I don't know how you don't see that. I tried to ask but he wouldn't talk to me."" FAMILIAR TERRITORY Monday ended a two-month stretch in which the Clippers never played two consecutive games in the same arena. Their 17 road games are tied for the NBA's third-most this season.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Larry Nance Jr. put himself in perfect position to make the final play Tuesday night. After outwrestling Victor Oladipo in front of the basket, the Cleveland Cavaliers center waited patiently as he anticipated Rodney Hood's errant layup then threw up his right hand and barely beat the buzzer. Nance finished with 15 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, six assists and the first game-winning shot of his pro career to give the Cavaliers a rare 92-91 road victory. It ended Indiana's seven-game winning streak. ""I told Hood to put the ball up on the rim with a couple seconds left so I can see if I could do something with it,"" Nance said. ""He made a good move and did exactly that. I was lucky enough to get a hand on it."" The shot set off a wild scene in which Cavs players began mobbing Nance before the replay review confirmed the call. Even some of Cleveland's injured players joined the celebration Inside the Pacers locker room players watched the replay, which appeared to show Nance tossing Oladipo to the ground and lamented the lack of a whistle. Still, Pacers coach Nate McMillan knew it should have never come down to that play. Indiana came into the game as the league's hottest team but lacked the intensity, passion and precision that had defined the first part of this season. Eventually, it cost them. On a night six Cavs players scored in double figures, including Hood, who had 17 points, Indiana shot a dismal 39.8 percent from the field, was 4 of 22 on 3-pointers and lost for the first time this season when allowing fewer than 97 points. With 9.5 seconds left, the Pacers still led 91-90 with Oladipo shooting two free throws. But when he missed both, the Cavs got one more chance after calling timeout -- and Nance made them pay. ""Larry was terrific, even beyond the putback,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""I thought he did a phenomenal job. Offensively, he made some terrific passes. He took good shots, he got to the offensive glass, and defensively he really competed."" Domantas Sabonis had 17 points and eight rebounds while Bojan Bogdanovic added 14 points for the Pacers, who seemed to get caught overlooking one of the league's worst teams with a showdown at Toronto looming Wednesday. ""We didn't come ready to play. Cleveland played hungrier than we did,"" Doug McDermott said.

"ATLANTA --  Jeremy Lin and the Atlanta Hawks expected John Wall's inevitable scoring burst that came in the third quarter. Lin had an even stronger response in the fourth. The veteran guard scored 12 of his 16 points in the final period and the Hawks overcame Bradley Beal's 29 points for a 118-110 victory over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. The Hawks outscored the Wizards 71-52 in the first and last quarters combined. ""I thought it was one of our best defensive games,"" Lin said. ""That gives you a chance."" Wall, scoreless as Washington trailed throughout the first half, had 10 points in the third period as the Wizards pulled even at 82 entering the fourth. Lin's outburst included a dribble fake that sent Thomas Satoransky falling backward, leaving Lin open for a jumper and a 103-93 lead. He added a layup on Atlanta's next possession. ""I didn't know he was going to pull all those tricks out of his bag tonight,"" teammate John Collins said. ""But we definitely appreciated everything he gave us."" Seven players scored in double figures to help the last-place Hawks (7-23) stop a three-game skid. Collins had 20 points and 13 rebounds, Trae Young scored 19 and Dewayne Dedmon added 13 points and 10 boards. Beal said the Wizards took the Hawks too lightly less than two weeks after a 131-117 win in Atlanta. ""Tonight it was just a matter of effort,"" he explained. ""We thought it was going to be an easy game and they whipped our (butt), plain and simple."" Trevor Ariza started at forward and scored 19 points in his return to the Wizards. Beal grabbed 10 rebounds. Kevin Huerter's 3-pointer pushed Atlanta's lead to 113-98. Ariza hit two late 3s to cut it to 116-109, but the Wizards never made another serious threat. The Hawks outscored Washington 36-28 in the final period. Wall, coming off his 40 points and 14 assists in a 128-110 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday night, missed each of his six shots in the first half. He finished with 15 points. ""Couldn't get in a rhythm,"" Wall said. ""They called so many fouls I couldn't even play."" The Hawks scored the first 10 points and didn't give up the lead until Washington opened the second half with six straight points, including Wall's first on a short jumper to tie it at 58. Wall's assist set up Thomas Bryant's go-ahead basket for the Wizards' first lead. TIP-INS Wizards: F Otto Porter Jr. (right knee) missed his fourth straight game. ...

Ariza played for Washington during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. WELCOME BACK II There was another Washington reunion. Wizards guard Chasson Randle, waived on Nov. 12, was re-signed to a one-year deal and had seven points. Randle filled the roster spot that opened with the trade for Ariza.

"NEW YORK --  LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers were rallying, trying to send themselves home on a winning note. The hottest team in the NBA wouldn't allow it. The Brooklyn Nets ran their longest winning streak in nearly four years to six games with a 115-110 victory Tuesday night, emphatically stopping James on his first shot and then holding him off down the stretch. D'Angelo Russell had 22 points and a career high-tying 13 assists against his former team as Brooklyn continued its recovery from an eight-game skid by hanging on in front of a loud, large sellout crowd of 17,732 that alternated cheering when the Lakers seized the momentum and when the Nets regained it. ""It's a great feeling,"" Russell said. ""I personally have never been in that position at this level to win six in a row. Definitely not satisfied."" James bounced back from his lowest-scoring game of the season with 36 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, but the Lakers finished 1/3 on their road trip. Kyle Kuzma had 22 points and 11 rebounds, while Lonzo Ball scored 23. ""We could've had a pretty good road trip but 1/3 is definitely not the way we would like to have it,"" James said. Joe Harris added 19 points and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 18 for the Nets, who last won six in a row from March 25 to April 3, 2015. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson finished with 17 points and Jared Dudley made some big baskets down the stretch to score 13. ""It's amazing, man,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""Just to see the hard work we put in, all the resiliency we had, it's amazing to be able to say we put together some wins."" Brooklyn led 100-87 with 7 1/2 minutes to play before back-to-back 3-pointers by Kuzma and Ball. James then scored inside, blocked a shot on the other end and scored again to make it 100-97. Dudley and Dinwiddie answered with drives, and Dudley hit two more baskets to settle the Nets before Russell's 3-pointer made it 113-107 with 22 seconds remaining. The Nets had scored 70 points in the first halves of their last two games, and were almost on pace in this one after taking a 33-32 lead after one quarter. They led 62-57 at halftime. ""That's why this team has won six games in a row. They have a lot of different guys that can hurt you,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. Brooklyn then used a 12-0 run to take its largest lead at 79-65 on Hollis-Jefferson's three-point play with 7:27 remaining in the third quarter. The Nets led 90-83 going to the fourth. James was limited to 13 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a loss to Washington on Sunday and things started rough for him in this one, as Jarrett Allen denied his attempt at a dunk with a sensational block. ""He's in his 20s, I'm in my 30s,"" James said. ""Takes me a little longer to get warmed up."" James was called for traveling the next time he had the ball before finding his groove. TIP-INS Lakers: JaVale McGee missed his second straight game with flu-like symptoms. ... The Lakers were 5 of 6 from 3-point range in the first quarter, with Ball going 3 of 3. Then they went 1 for 10 in the second. Nets: G Allen Crabbe missed his third straight game because of a sore right knee. ... The Nets snapped an eight-game skid against West teams with their first win since Nov. 9 at Denver. HELP ON THE WAY Rajon Rondo (right hand surgery) and Brandon Ingram (sprained left ankle) were recalled from the South Bay Lakers, where they were on rehab assignments. Walton said Ingram was still limited at practice Tuesday but Rondo wasn't, adding the hope was that both could go full speed when they rejoin the Lakers in practice on Thursday. Rondo has missed 17 games and Ingram has sat out seven. SINGING STRUGGLES British singer and actress Cynthia Erivo struggled through her performance of the national anthem. She appeared to forget the words at one point and stopped singing. After pausing to refocus, she began again from the start of the song, got the same word wrong she did the first time and then skipped a couple of lines. But the crowd was supportive of her strong finish and gave her a nice ovation afterward.","401071134"
"DENVER --  Nuggets 7-footer Nikola Jokic stared at the stat sheet lying on the ground near his salmon-colored shoes. He pretty much liked everything he saw -- and it was easy to see why. Jokic had 32 points and 16 rebounds, Jamal Murray dished out a career-high 15 assists and Denver extended its home winning streak to seven games by beating the Dallas Mavericks 126-118 on Tuesday night. At 21-9, the Nuggets matched the 1976-77 squad for the best start through 30 games in the franchise's NBA history. They also remained atop the Western Conference by percentage points over Golden State. This is certainly rarefied air for the Nuggets: The last time before this season they had played more than 25 games and were alone in first place in the conference was March 1977. ""It's a good thing. But we need to stay hungry,"" Jokic said. ""We can get better."" Nuggets coach Michael Malone really isn't all that surprised by his team's fast start. Missing the postseason by a game last season fueled this squad. ""They bought in a long time ago, man,"" Malone said. ""There's a lot of fun in that locker room right now. Winning is great. Hopefully we can sustain this."" Murray contributed 22 points for the injury-depleted Nuggets, including 10 in the fourth quarter. That came on the heels of scoring 15 in the fourth quarter of a win over Toronto on Sunday. ""When he wakes up like that, there's nobody who can stop him,"" Jokic said. Luka Doncic had a big game for Dallas with 23 points and a career-best 12 assists, while Harrison Barnes scored 30. The Mavericks hit 15 3-pointers against the NBA's top long-range defense. It wasn't enough. ""Our defense obviously could have been tighter,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Some of it was great shot-making by them, and some of it was untimely mistakes by us. We've got to build on the positives and pick up the defense and rebounding."" The Nuggets held each opponent under 100 points in their last six wins at the Pepsi Center. But this one turned into a track meet -- a throwback to days of old for Denver. Still, it was a defensive play that helped save the night for the Nuggets. Sparked by a 14-0 run at the end of the third, the Nuggets took a 105-95 lead into the final quarter. Dallas trimmed it to four before Monte Morris hit a 3-pointer to give Denver some separation. Murray then blocked a shot and hit a jumper on the other end to seal the win. The Nuggets remain without starters Will Barton, Gary Harris and Paul Millsap due to injuries. Juancho Hernangomez started despite being questionable with a strained abdomen. He finished with 12 points, one of seven Denver players to score in double figures. TIP-INS Mavericks: G Dennis Smith Jr. sat out with a sprained right wrist. ... Carlisle and Wesley Matthews received technical fouls for arguing calls. ... G J.J. Barea returned from a sprained ankle and had 10 points. ... F DeAndre Jordan fouled out with 6:29 remaining. He had 11 points and 12 rebounds. Nuggets: Murray picked up a technical in the first quarter for hanging on the rim and Malone another in the third when he argued a call on Jokic. ... The Nuggets outscored the Mavs 64-44 in the paint. MVP CHATTER Jokic has taken his game to an MVP level. Just ask his coach. ""Nikola is showing everybody in the NBA ... he's a Most Valuable Player candidate,"" Malone said. ""Not just from a stats standpoint -- he does it every single night and in so many different ways. That's why he's a special player."" Jokic just shrugged it off. ""That's an individual thing,"" he said. ""If it happens, it happens."" DONCIC EFFECT The most impressive thing about Doncic through the early portion of the season? That's easy for Carlisle. ""Probably how consistently he makes half-court shots during shootaround,"" the coach cracked.","401071135"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker admitted he was frustrated watching his shots misfire for the third straight game as the Charlotte Hornets fell behind by double digits in the first half. However, the two-time All-Star kept pushing, prodding and eventually found his way with 30 points and six assists as the Hornets rallied to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 110-99 Wednesday night. ""It's frustrating,"" Walker said of missing the first seven shots one game after scoring a season-low four points on two of 13 shooting last Saturday. ""It was shots that I usually make and shots that I work on all the time. ""Sometimes, you've just got to stick with it and try your best not to let the frustration get to you. You know, keep positive thoughts and just keep on pushing through."" A reverse layup with 4:49 left in the first half got Walker untracked and he finished shooting 11 of 26, including 4 for 12 on 3-pointers, as the Hornets even their record at 15-15. It was the ninth game of the season with at least 30 points for Walker, and helped Charlotte stop a two-game losing streak. Hornets coach James Borrego said he had a simple message for Walker during his first half struggles. ""Yes -- keep shooting,"" Borrego said. ""He's been doing this his entire life. I said, `Stay confident, keep shooting and we're going to keep looking for you.',,, Sometimes players need to see one drop, then two drop and three drop and he got rolling there."" Jeremy Lamb added 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Marvin Williams had 18 points and 10 boards for Charlotte. Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points, Jaron Blossomgame had 15 and Cedi Osman added 13 for the Cavaliers. After the Cavaliers pulled to 88-82 with 8:52 left in the game, Charlotte started a 17-4 run to seal the win. Cleveland center Larry Nance, Jr., whose team led 38-25 in the middle of the second quarter and 46-41 at halftime, had on a one-name answer when asked what the difference in the game was. ""Kemba,"" Nance said. ""He started to heat up in that third quarter and really just took over. Any time a player like that gets going, it's hard to slow him down."" After going scoreless on 0-for-5 first-quarter shooting, Walker scored nine points in the second quarter while shooting 4 for 8, and added 17 points in the third quarter (6-for-9 shooting) and four points in the fourth quarter (on 1 for 4).

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The San Antonio Spurs came out shooting -- and hitting. LeMarcus Aldridge scored 20 points and five San Antonio players scored in double figures as the Spurs rolled to a 129-90 victory over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. The NBA's leading 3-point shooting team, the Spurs went 12 for 19 from behind the arc and 50 for 77 overall to win for the sixth time in seven games. The overall shooting percentage of .649 is the highest ever against the Magic in Orlando. ""Obviously we had a great night shooting,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, ""and when you shoot that well it gives you a good chance to win the game."" There wasn't much of a game after the Spurs shot their way to a 20-point lead just 3:19 into the second quarter. Marco Belinelli came off the bench and scored 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting, and DeMar DeRozan and Bryn Forbes added 17 points each. ""Everybody was hitting shots. We were moving the ball well with 29 assists,"" Forbes said. ""That's the effort we want night-in and night-out. That's exactly what we're looking for."" D.J. Augustin led Orlando with 17 points. Rookie center Mo Bamba had seven points, eight rebounds and two blocks in his first NBA start. ""I'm learning that this is an every-night league and we've got to bring it every night or things like this are going to happen,"" said Bamba, who played 26 minutes as a replacement for Nikola Vucevic. Aaron Gordon, who had 26 points in the Magic's win at San Antonio on Nov. 4, went scoreless in the first half and finished with 12 points and nine rebounds. Forbes, Belinelli and Davis Bertans combined for eight 3-pointers to help the Spurs (17-15) take a 47-27 lead with 8:41 left in the first half. Rudy Gay finished a 9-0 run with a dunk late in the first half, stretching San Antonio's lead to 60-35. The Magic (13-15) never cut their deficit to less than 17 points in the second half. ""We weren't ready to defend or fight at all,"" said coach Steve Clifford. ""They played great and we were terrible."" It was Orlando's first game this season without Vucevic. But although Popovich called the veteran center's absence ""a huge factor,"" it wasn't as huge as their margin of defeat. ""It hurt the team, obviously, to not have Vuc,"" said Evan Fournier. ""But we lost by 37 (actually 39) tonight? So Vuc, as good as he is, doesn't make that much of a difference. We were just bad."" BIG DEFENSIVE CHANGE FOR SPURS After a five-game stretch (including three losses) in which they gave up 112.2 points per game, the Spurs have held six straight opponents under 100, yielding just 91.5 per game. ""We didn't change the strategy at all. We watched film, talked about some things, and I guess they listened,"" Popovich said. ""Or maybe the other teams just all missed shots every night. I don't know. It's a big change, for sure."" TIP-INS Spurs: Forbes, who was 2 for 13 from 3-point range in the preceding three games, was 3 for 3 in the first nine minutes and had 13 points. ...

"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons was angry at himself by halftime. The New York Knicks paid for it after the break. Joel Embiid had 24 points and 10 rebounds, Simmons got his second triple-double in his last three games, and the Philadelphia 76ers snapped out of a funk to beat the Knicks 131-109 on Wednesday night. Simmons finished with 13 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, but said his numbers don't tell the whole story. ""I was just frustrated,"" Simmons said. ""I want to play well and perform for the team. I want to make sure we win every game we play. I think the second half was a different kind of Ben."" Jimmy Butler added 20 points and rookie Landry Shamet had a career-high 17 off the bench for the Sixers (21-12), who shot 53.4 percent from the field and 50 percent from 3-point range. Philadelphia had lost three of four, including a lopsided defeat in San Antonio on Monday. ""For most of the game, our offense was humming,"" said JJ Redick, who finished with 14 points, surpassing the 10,000-point milestone for his career. ""I thought Ben was great in terms of being on the attack. They really had no answer for Jo (Embiid). And the biggest thing was the second half, we were pretty good defensively."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 27 points and Kevin Knox had 21 for the Knicks (9-24), who have lost three straight and eight of their last nine. Emmanuel Mudiay, averaging 20 points per game in his previous nine contests, was held to 11 points on 3-of-12 shooting. ""It's tough when you have Ben Simmons, who's really fast, who's running downhill the whole game,"" Knox said. ""You've got Embiid, who's hard to really guard in the post. ... They've just got a lot of weapons."" The Sixers were clicking offensively from the start, scoring 38 points on nearly 70 percent shooting in the first quarter, capped by a four-point play from Furkan Korkmaz. They led by as many as 14 in the first half and took a 69-61 lead into halftime, though the Knicks closed the half on a highlight-reel alley oop from Hardaway to Knox. After the Knicks cut Philly's lead to three early in the third, Embiid and Simmons had back-to-back one handed slams to get the home crowd going and help the Sixers pull away. ""We hung around,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""That's kind of what we do. We're pests.

The Sixers had their best shooting first half of the season (58.7 percent). MR. 10,000 When asked about becoming the 47th active NBA player to score 10,000 points, Redick was self-deprecating before pausing to appreciate his longevity. ""If you had told me 10 years ago as a third-year guy struggling to get into the rotation that I would score 10,000 points, I would think you were crazy,"" he said. ""It's a cool thing for me. I didn't realize I was that close."" EASY TRIPLE-DOUBLES Just because Simmons had his fourth triple-double of the season -- and the 16th of his career -doesn't mean he was happy with his performance. ""Some guys don't ever get (triple-doubles) in their career,"" he said. ""I'm fortunate to have a playing style where it's pretty easy."" TIMMY TIME Fizdale said Hardaway, the team's top scorer who missed New York's last game, has been dealing with plantar fasciitis but added that he has no thoughts of shutting him down.

Devin Booker had 25 points and eight assists, and rookie Deandre Ayton added 23 points and 18 rebounds to lead the suddenly resurgent Suns past the Boston Celtics 111-103 on Wednesday night. ""We had multiple conversations when we were losing early in the year,"" Booker said. ""We looked around the locker room and said, `Nobody's going to feel bad for us."" It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Suns since opening the season 4-24. Phoenix has its first four-game winning streak since March 2015. ""There's so much positivity,"" said Ayton, who tied his season high in rebounds. ""You can just tag along and add your piece."" T.J. Warren scored 21 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 13 in his Suns debut. Kyrie Irving led Boston with 29 points and Jayson Tatum had 18. The Celtics lost their second straight after winning eight in a row. Boston center Aron Baynes broke a bone in his left hand early in the game and the team announced that he'll be sidelined indefinitely. The Celtics opened a quick 11-point lead early in the game, but the Suns came charging back. ""I think it started after the first quarter,"" Irving said. ""They just picked up their aggressiveness and they were pretty much in rhythm for the rest of the night."" The Suns led by six entering the final quarter and pushed it to 92-80 on Jamal Crawford's 3-pointer from the top of the arc with just under 10 minutes to play. They led 97-84 before Boston sliced it to five on Marcus Smart's 3 with 1:49 to go. Warren was fouled by Smart taking a 3 on the ensuing possession and made all three free throws. After a 3 by Irving, Oubre nailed a 3-pointer at the other end to help the Suns hold on. Smart's 3 at the second-quarter buzzer gave the Celtics a 62-59 halftime lead. Boston grabbed its 11-point lead early in the first only to see the Suns use a 25-7 run over a 6 1/2-minute stretch in the second. Baynes blocked Ayton's pass and shook his hand in visible pain before heading to the locker room during a stoppage in play. TIP-INS Suns: Warren went to the floor hard in the second quarter and walked slowly to the bench during a timeout. He did return to the game. ... Phoenix lost the first meeting between the teams in overtime at home on Nov. 8. . Oubre was acquired Monday in a trade with Washington.

""Feeling better, getting better. Reassess pretty much every day,"" Stevens said. ... F Marcus Morris also missed the game with a sore right knee. ... Boston shot 70.8 percent (17 of 24) in the first quarter. NOT THIS TIME Booker had scored 38 points or more in his last three games against Boston, including 70 at TD Garden on March 24, 2017.

"TORONTO --  After seven straight wins, Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers suddenly are having trouble finishing. Fred VanVleet hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 25 seconds left and the Toronto Raptors rallied from a 17-point deficit to beat the Pacers 99-96 on Wednesday night. One night after he missed a pair of free throws in the final 10 seconds and Indiana surrendered a tip-in at the buzzer in a 92-91 loss to lowly Cleveland that ended a season-long winning streak, Oladipo and the Pacers stumbled again. Oladipo turned the ball over twice in the final minute Wednesday -- once when he failed to get across mid-court within eight seconds. ""I made a mistake, I guess,"" a downcast Oladipo said. ""I can't do nothing about it now except learn from it."" Kawhi Leonard scored 28 points, Pascal Siakam had 17 and Greg Monroe 13 as Toronto snapped a two-game losing streak. The Raptors, who have the best record in the NBA at 24-9, avoided their second three-game slump of the season. ""We did a good job of sticking in there and keeping our heads up"" Leonard said. VanVleet scored nine of his 11 points in the final quarter as Toronto won its 10th straight home meeting with the Pacers. Indiana has not won in Toronto since March 1, 2013. Oladipo scored 20 points for the Pacers, who made only 5 of 18 shots in the fourth, scoring 11 points. ""Everything just went their way,"" Oladipo said. Pacers coach Nate McMillan said turnovers were to blame for his team's late collapse. Indiana finished with 23 turnovers, including six by Oladipo and five from fellow guard Darren Collison. ""Tonight their pressure bothered us,"" McMillan said. ""Just poor execution down the stretch."" Bojan Bogdanovic scored 18 points, Myles Turner had 10 points and 14 rebounds and Domantas Sabonis had 12 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana. Toronto shot 4 for 22 from 3-point range through the first three quarters, but made 3 of 8 in the fourth to avoid a season-worst performance from long range. ""It takes a lot of energy to play that bad then that good at the end,"" VanVleet said. ""It was a roller coaster of emotions and energy and effort."" The short-handed Raptors were without starting point guard Kyle Lowry, who missed his third straight game because of a sore left thigh, and center Serge Ibaka, who was inactive because of a sore right knee. VanVleet and Siakam returned to the starting lineup after missing Sunday's loss at Denver because of back soreness. Forward Norman Powell returned after a 21-game absence caused by a left shoulder injury. Toronto trailed 88-75 less than two minutes into the fourth, but battled back to tie it 92-all on Siakam's driving layup at 4:12. Oladipo restored Indiana's lead with a jump shot at 1:36, but VanVleet's long 3-pointer with 25 seconds to go put Toronto up one, 97-96. With Indiana looking for a potential winning basket, Toronto's Danny Green forced Oladipo into a jump ball with less than three seconds remaining. The Raptors recovered the ball and Green sealed it with a pair of free throws. Indiana led 58-50 at halftime and was ahead 85-75 after three. NO FEAR VanVleet said he's never afraid to shoot, even when he starts 1 for 12 from the field, as he did Wednesday. ""If you don't want me to shoot, then I'll be on the bench,"" he said.

"CHICAGO --  A few weeks ago, the Brooklyn Nets were mired in an extended losing streak mainly because of shortcomings on the defensive end late in games. On this night, they showed just how much they've progressed in that area. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 27 points off the bench and made a critical defensive play in the final seconds, lifting the Nets over the Chicago Bulls 96-93 Wednesday for their seventh consecutive victory. Jarrett Allen had 16 points and 12 rebounds for the resurgent Nets (15-18), who had dropped eight straight before putting together the NBA's longest active winning streak. ""One of the things that was causing us to lose those games is that we weren't getting enough stops,"" Dinwiddie said. ""To win a game when we both scored in the 90s is big-time for a young group and shows our constant improvements."" Brooklyn's effort was even more impressive considering it came on the second night of a back-to-back, following an emotional 115-110 victory at home Tuesday over LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. ""After last night's win it could be easy to rest on your laurels, and road back-to-backs have been tough for us,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""If you want to rank the wins, I put this one first and last night's second."" Kris Dunn scored 24 points for Chicago, which has the worst record in the league at 7-25 after dropping 12 of its last 14. Bobby Portis added 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls before exiting in the final minute with an apparent left ankle sprain. ""I like the fact that we hung in there,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""I thought we were in mud a little bit at times and a little stagnant."" Chicago led 93-92 before Joe Harris put Brooklyn ahead to stay on a floating bank shot -- after pump-faking on a 3-pointer -- with 43 seconds left. But the key to the win was the Nets' defense on the last two possessions. First, they forced Lauri Markkanen into an offensive foul. Following a Brooklyn turnover, Dinwiddie then deflected a handoff to Dunn at the top of the key and Harris gathered the loose ball with 2.3 seconds to go. ""Kris Dunn had been very aggressive for them all night, so I figured it was a best bet to deny him versus letting him catch and just trying to get one last stop,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Fortunately enough, (Justin) Holiday put the ball out a little bit and I was able to kind of knock it away."" Dinwiddie was fouled with 1.4 seconds left and made both free throws for a three-point margin. Chicago, which was out of timeouts and couldn't advance the ball, never got a shot off that could have tied the game. The score was tied at 71 entering the fourth quarter. The Bulls picked up their defensive intensity early in the period -- including some full-court pressure -- to force Brooklyn into a few sloppy turnovers. The result was an 86-80 Chicago lead midway through the quarter, but the Nets answered with seven straight points to regain the lead. TIP-INS Nets: F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (bruised left quad) was a game-time decision. He finished with nine points in 28 minutes. Bulls: F Jabari Parker sat out a second straight game because of a stomach illness. Parker entered third on the team in scoring at 15.2 points per game, but he was taken out of the regular rotation last week. ... C Robin Lopez was fined $25,000 and Dunn $15,000 by the NBA for their role in an altercation during Monday's 121-96 loss at Oklahoma City. Raymond Felton and Dennis Schroder of the Thunder were each suspended one game for leaving the bench area during the scuffle. SIDELINED Bulls G Zach LaVine will miss two to four weeks with a sprained left ankle. LaVine leads the team in scoring with an average of 23.8 points. He also leads in assists (4.8) and is averaging 4.9 rebounds. He was injured late in a 97-91 loss to Orlando last Thursday in Mexico City. LaVine had an MRI in San Antonio on Saturday and was re-evaluated this week when the team returned to Chicago. ""The good news, I guess, is it's just an ankle sprain,"" he said.","401071141"
"HOUSTON -- James Harden scored 35 points as the Houston Rockets set an NBA record with 26 3-pointers and won their fifth straight game 136-118 over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. A 3 by Gary Clark tied the record with 2:42 left, and fans began chanting, ""Three, three, three,"" every time Houston got the ball after that. The Rockets missed their next four tries before Michael Carter-Williams hit one with 31.1 seconds left and was greeted with loud cheers. The previous record was held by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who made 25 against Atlanta on March 3, 2017. Harden made six 3s, Chris Paul added five, and Gerald Green and Eric Gordon made four each on a night when Houston attempted 55. The win streak ties the Rockets' longest of the season and comes after they lost their previous three games. Houston had a comfortable lead throughout most of this one, and seven straight points, capped by a dunk from Clint Capela, made it 111-94 with about nine minutes left. Tomas Satoransky and Bradley Beal made back-to-back 3-pointers for Washington after that, but Harden ended the run with a 3 that left Houston ahead 114-100. The Rockets then used a 12-3 run, with all their points coming on 3s, to make it 123-103 with about five minutes left. Harden and Gordon both made one in that span, and Green capped the spurt with two. Coach Mike D'Antoni cleared the bench soon after. Beal had 28 points to lead the Wizards, who lost for the sixth time in seven games. Houston led by 12 at halftime, and a basket by Paul left the Rockets up 80-64 with about nine minutes left in the third quarter. The Wizards used a 6-3 run, with four points from Wall, after that to cut the lead to 83-70. The Rockets made four quick points later in the quarter, highlighted by a reverse layup by Gordon, to leave them up 91-76 with about three-and-a-half minutes left in the quarter. Washington got within 11 late in the third quarter, but Harden scored the next five points, capped by a 3-pointer, to make it 101-85. The Wizards scored the last five points of the quarter, with three free throws, to cut the lead to 101-90 entering the fourth. The victory came after the Wizards won the first meeting against Houston this season 135-131 in overtime on Nov. 26, despite a season-high 54 points from Harden. The Wizards often double-teamed Harden in the first half, leaving others open, which led to easy baskets in the lane and a 70-58 lead by the Rockets at halftime. TIP-INS Wizards: Made 10 of 30 3-pointers. ... John Wall added 18 points with 12 assists. ... Trevor Ariza had 15 points in his second game since a trade from Phoenix. Rockets: Gordon added 18 points. ... James Ennis missed his fourth straight game with a strained right hamstring. ... Houston had 15 turnovers.","401071142"
"MILWAUKEE --  As usual, Giannis Antetokounmpo put up the big numbers. But it was D.J. Wilson and his fellow reserves who caught the eye of first-year Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. Antetokounmpo had 25 points, eight assists and eight rebounds, and the Bucks got a big effort from their bench Wednesday night in a hard-fought 123-115 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. ""It's a huge statement. You need that throughout the season,"" Budenholzer said. ""You need your bench. It's a really important part."" Wilson, who has seen little action this season due to lingering injuries, added nine points and 10 rebounds. He was on the court for much of the fourth quarter as Milwaukee improved to 21-9. ""I think it just shows the work I've been putting in and the opportunity I've been given,"" Wilson said. Antetokounmpo praised the effort of the second-year player. ""D.J. has done a great job of just playing the game and waiting for his chance,"" he said. ""He's learning right now."" Another bench player, newly acquired George Hill, had 11 points and hit a 3-pointer at the horn to end the third quarter and tie it at 90 in a game that featured seven ties and 14 lead changes through the first three periods. Tony Snell also chipped in with 13 points in a reserve role. New Orleans, already short-handed in the frontcourt due to a rash of injuries, played an extended stretch without star forward Anthony Davis, who led the Pelicans with 14 points and five rebounds in the first quarter. He limped off the court and directly to the locker room with an apparent left ankle injury in the waning seconds of the period after his legs got tangled with teammate Andrew Harrison underneath the basket as Harrison drew a charge on Thon Maker. Davis, who also appeared shaken up on the previous play when he fell to his knees after blocking a shot, returned to the bench briefly at the start of the second quarter before again heading to locker room. The Pelicans' public relations staff tweeted shortly before halftime that Davis' return was questionable due to illness, not injury. Davis returned to the bench in the third quarter and entered the game almost immediately. Davis did not speak with reporters after the game. ""He was sick,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""He went in and lost his lunch a couple of times, but he was able to come back out."" Davis scored the Pelicans' first nine points in the fourth quarter and finished with 27, along with 11 rebounds. Jrue Holiday had 25 points and 12 assists. The game remained tight throughout the fourth before the Bucks went on an 11-0 run to build a 10-point lead with 3:18 remaining. The Pelicans got no closer than six the rest of the way. The Bucks opened a 12-point lead in the second before New Orleans rallied to take a 66-62 lead at halftime sparked by Darius Miller, who poured in a season-high 17 points and finished with 20. STEPPING UP Backup center Jahlil Okafor, who has struggled, had a season-high 17 points in 13 minutes for New Orleans. ""I've just been staying ready,"" Okafor said. ""My teammates were telling me to keep going, so they gave me a lot of confidence."" Gentry said the key is for Okafor ""to relax and play under control."" ""He's just got to get into that right situation,"" the coach said. ""You have to keep yourself prepared."" TURNAROUND After missing eight of nine shots, including seven of eight from 3-point range Sunday in a loss to Miami, Miller rebounded by making seven of 15 shots overall and going 6 of 11 from beyond the arc. TIP-INS Pelicans: F Nikola Mirotic sat out for the third consecutive game with a right ankle injury. ... F Julius Randle, who left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a right ankle sprain, didn't play. Miller replaced him in the starting lineup. ... A right ankle injury also sidelined G Ian Clark.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Trailing by 14 to start the fourth quarter, the Detroit Pistons got rolling on 3-pointers. However, their shortest shot of the night might have been the most important. Blake Griffin scored 34 points and Reggie Bullock added a career-high 33 as the Pistons beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 129-123 in overtime on Wednesday night. Andre Drummond's tip-in with 0.6 seconds left sent the game into overtime. Then the NBA's leading rebounder hit a rare 3-pointer of his own in overtime to put the Pistons on top for good. ""I wanted the ball more,"" Drummond said about his putback of Jackson's miss at the end of regulation. ""I went and got it and took my time to finish the play."" Reggie Jackson added 24 points and Drummond finished with 16 points and 16 rebounds for Detroit. Derrick Rose led Minnesota with 33 points, while Robert Covington scored 22 and Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins each had 16. ""Building a lead isn't easy, and we just gave it away,"" a dejected Wiggins said. ""But we had a chance to win with that last rebound. We needed it and didn't get it."" Trailing 92-78 to start the fourth, the Pistons were 9 for 13 on 3s in the quarter to claw their way back into the game. Bullock, who set his previous career high of 24 points on Monday night in Milwaukee, hit 7 of 12 from behind the arc on the night, while Griffin went 5 for 10. ""I think we've done a pretty good job of not being gun-shy,"" said Griffin, whose team started 2 for 12 on 3s but finished 20 for 48. ""I think we're getting a lot of open shots and we're taking them, whether we make them or not. Tonight in the second half, we did and that's the difference."" Covington's 3 from the corner put Minnesota on top 118-116 with 7.4 seconds to play in regulation. On the Pistons' last possession, Jackson drove for a layup that rimmed out, but Drummond put the rebound in to force overtime. Midway through overtime with the shot clock running out on a Pistons possession, Drummond hit a 3 from the corner -- just his fourth in 21 attempts this season -- to give Detroit a 123-122 lead. ""Corner 3 is something I shoot every day, day in and day out, workouts, before games, workouts after practice,"" Drummond said. ""It's a shot that I take all the time. I shot it with confidence and I knew it was going in."" After he and Towns traded free throws, Jackson converted a drive to put the Pistons up by three with 1:28 to go in the extra session. On Minnesota's next possession, Towns got the ball down low and hit a short shot but he was called for an offensive foul, his sixth foul of the night, and the Pistons were able to hold on for the win. ""We just had a lot of unfortunate events, and we didn't do what we needed to do,"" said Towns, who was 0 for 7 on 3s. ""That's how it happened."" Minnesota fell behind 12-0 and missed its first eight 3-point attempts, but the Wolves finally cashed in when Covington made one from beyond the arc with 6 minutes to play in the second quarter, giving Minnesota a 44-37 lead that grew to 62-53 at halftime. But the Timberwolves didn't have an answer for Detroit's hot shooting at the end of the game. ""The fourth quarter is different and you have to react to what's going on. So that is disappointing,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I think they had 78 after three, and then a 40-point fourth quarter. And then all we had to do was get a stop, and we give up a second shot. That can't happen."" GRIFFIN SICK Griffin was coming off his ninth career triple-double and first of the season on Monday at Milwaukee. But before Wednesday's game he needed IV fluids to overcome a flu bug he'd caught. ""He gave it everything,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""He played a hell of a game to be as sick as he was."" Drummond wasn't necessarily convinced of his teammate's illness. ""He looked fine to me,"" he deadpanned. ""Start having stomach problems more often."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit tied its season high with 20 3-pointers. ... F Glenn Robinson (sprained left ankle) missed his fourth straight game, while G Ish Smith remains out with a right groin injury he suffered two weeks ago. Timberwolves: Teague missed his second straight game with left ankle inflammation. ... G Jerryd Bayless dressed for the first time with the Timberwolves.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Playing strong defense has typically proven to be a winning formula for Utah. Getting to that point has taken more turns and detours than the Jazz anticipated this season. Beating the defending NBA champions offers evidence that Utah is finally finding the defensive form the team and its fans took for granted at the end of last season. Joe Ingles scored 20 points, Rudy Gobert had 17 points, 15 rebounds, and matched his season-high with four blocked shots to lead the Jazz to a 108-103 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night. Utah held Golden State to 40 percent shooting from the field and 32 percent from the perimeter. The biggest stops came in the final two minutes when the Warriors missed three out of four shot attempts -- including a pair of 3-pointers that could have forced overtime. ""We defended for a full game,"" Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""We were locked into the game plan. When you play defense like that, and we shoot the way we did, the outcome is going to be the way it was."" Jae Crowder added 18 points and 11 rebounds while Donovan Mitchell had 15 points on 5-of-26 shooting as Utah won its fourth straight home game. Stephen Curry scored 32 points and Kevin Durant added 30 in just the Warriors' second loss in eight games. ""We let them off the hook a little bit,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""They weren't playing that well but we made a lot of mistakes. We couldn't find the necessary energy and execution you need to win in this building."" After taking a three-point lead at halftime, the Jazz stayed in front through much of the third quarter as Ingles, Korver and Crowder combined for seven 3-pointers over the last half of the quarter. Utah outscored Golden State 9-2 to open the fourth. Ingles finished off the run with another outside basket, giving the Jazz a 93-82 lead. Durant cut Utah's lead to 106-103 on a 3 with 1:12 remaining. He missed a potential tying basket from the corner with 39 seconds left. Andre Iguodala had a shot at another outside basket in the final seconds, but also missed. The offensive rebound went off Curry's hands and out of bounds with 2.4 seconds left. ""They created a little bit of separation, but we fought hard and I liked that energy and effort on the defensive end,"" Curry said. ""We gave ourselves a chance to get over the hump down the stretch, but it just didn't happen."" Utah used a 10-0 run to take a 19-11 lead in the first quarter. Gobert scored on a pair of dunks and Korver made two 3-pointers to fuel the spurt. The Warriors rallied when Curry took over in the second quarter. He totaled 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting in the quarter. Curry scored his last three baskets -- a pair of layups and a 3 -- to help fuel a 11-5 spurt that gave the Warriors a 48-42 lead. He didn't have same impact in the second half, scoring just 11 points on a total of five baskets. ""We just gave him different looks,"" Crowder said. ""I feel like the way we played him wore on him a little bit. We just gave him a lot of bodies to see in front of him."" Utah edged back in front 56-53 just before halftime when Ingles knocked down a go-ahead 3-pointer in the corner and then stole the ball from Durant to set up a pair of free throws from Ricky Rubio. SHOOTING STRUGGLES Mitchell was a season-worst 19.2 percent from the field. His previous low was 21.4 percent when he went 3 for 14 for 12 points in a 96-88 win over Memphis on Nov. 12th. It marked the third straight game where he took at least 20 field goal attempts and shot under 40 percent from the field. Mitchell found other ways to make an impact. He totaled six assists, five rebounds and two steals. HOT CURRY Since returning from an 11-game absence due to a groin injury, Curry has shot at a blistering pace. Wednesday night marked his fifth game in the last nine with 30 or more points. He has shot 47 percent or better from the floor in six of those contests and has missed just one free throw on 47 attempts so far in December. TIP INS Warriors: Durant passed Gary Payton (21,813 points) for 32nd place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. He now has 21,836 points. ... Golden State held the Jazz to 39.8 percent shooting. It is the first time the Warriors lost this season after holding an opponent to under 40 percent from the field. Jazz: Gobert grabbed eight of his 15 rebounds in the first quarter. ... Utah tallied at least 39 points off the bench for the fifth straight home game. ... The Jazz finished with 30 assists, the seventh time they have had at least 30 this season. Ricky Rubio led the way with 10 assists. Utah is 27-0 dating back to Nov. 26, 2008, when getting 30 or more assists at home.","401071145"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Trail Blazers' bench is proving to be difficult to stop when all five players come together. Portland's reserves were key in the team's 99-92 victory over the Grizzlies on Wednesday night, outscoring the Memphis bench 44-14. ""It's great when guys are getting open, everybody's setting screens and being unselfish, looking for guys and not looking for their own shot, not looking to go one-on-one the whole time. It's contagious and everyone loves playing like that,"" forward Zach Collins said. It was the second time in the past week that Portland's bench has been instrumental in a victory. The reserves outscored their counterparts for Toronto 58-26 in a 128-122 victory over the Raptors last Friday night. ""It was good to see them play well, play with confidence,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""They moved the ball well, played with a lot of energy. They were the difference in the game just like they were a few nights ago."" Damian Lillard led the Blazers with 24 points, including 15 in the third quarter. Meyers Leonard combined for 12 points and eight rebounds. ""I just know we played hard, we played together and we're playing well right now,"" Leonard said of the second unit. ""So we just have to continue to do what we're doing."" Portland went on an 11-0 run to start the fourth quarter and stretched its lead to 85-71 on Collins' layup and Seth Curry's 3-pointer. The Blazers led by as many as 16 points in the period. Memphis closed within 99-92 after Marc Gasol's free throws with 45.5 seconds left, but couldn't catch up for their fourth straight loss. The Grizzlies were led by Mike Conley with 23 points. ""Sometimes teams just go through lulls like this,"" Conley said. ""You hit spells where you seem to rattle in and out every open look you get."" Memphis was coming off a 110-93 loss Monday at the Golden State Warriors, the first of a four-game road swing. Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said before the game that center Joakim Noah would not play because of an Achilles injury. But Conley, who missed the game against the Warriors because of hamstring soreness, started. The Grizzlies got off to a fast start, going up 17-8 at the start and capitalizing on six Portland turnovers. Portland closed the gap and tied it at 17 on Meyers Leonard's 3-pointer before the end of the first quarter. Evan Turner's pullup jumper gave Portland a 19-18 lead early in the second, and Grizzlies weren't able to re-take the lead until Jaren Jackson's driving layup made it 35-34. Conley made consecutive 3-pointers and the Grizzlies led 52-47 at the half. He led all scorers with 15 points. After a slow start in the first half, Lillard hit four 3-pointers and 15 points in the third quarter. Leonard's 3-pointer put Portland in front 74-67. ""That second unit came in the third and early fourth and really gave them a great spark,"" Conley said. ""They play with a lot of energy and do a lot of things with great force and force you to guess both sides of the court and that's a tough thing to do."" The Blazers were coming off a 131-127 victory on the road against the Clippers. Lillard had 22 points in the third quarter and Portland snapped a six-game losing streak on the road. TIP INS Grizzlies: Bickerstaff said the Grizzlies missed Dillon Brooks, who missed his 20th game because of a right knee injury. Brooks, who played for the Oregon Ducks, is in his second NBA season. ""We miss the tenacity that he plays with. The toughness. A never-given-in attitude,"" Bickerstaff said before the game. Trail Blazers: Lillard was just 2 of 7 from the field in the first half. ... Every Blazer who played scored. ... Portland had 21 turnovers. ... It was the fourth straight win at home for Portland, matching the team's season high. PUT IT IN THE BOOK: The win came in Lillard's 500th career game. He has scored 11,685 points, had 1,365 3-pointers and 3,113 assists. SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS: ""Were going through a rough patch right now. In the NBA it happens. Our responsibility is to come up with the best way to get out of it. Everybody in that locker room has to participate in our own rescue. That's what we're gonna do. We're not gonna quit, we're not gonna back down. This group is going to continue to compete. We've just got to find our mojo,"" Bickerstaff said after the loss.","401071146"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan thought his team spent too much time shooting 3-pointers in two losses earlier this season to the Sacramento Kings. But on Wednesday night, the Thunder focused on their inside game and came away with a win. Paul George scored 43 points, Russell Westbrook had a triple-double and Steven Adams grabbed a career-high 23 rebounds in a 132-113 victory over the Kings. Oklahoma City had a season-best 66 rebounds, compared to 43 for Sacramento. ""Steven was phenomenal on the glass,"" Donovan said. ""One of the things we wanted to do is play closer to the rim. I felt we needed to play closer to the basket."" George hit four 3-pointers and went 9 of 10 from the free throw line. Westbrook had 19 points, 17 assists and 11 boards for the 112th triple-double of his career. George and Adams had double-doubles -- George pulled down 12 rebounds and Adams scored 20 points -- as the Thunder won for the eighth time in 11 games. Nine of Adams' rebounds came on the offensive end. ""(Adams) has been doing that all season,"" Westbrook said. ""There's nobody that's going to stop him from doing what he's doing every night."" Buddy Hield had a career-best 37 points, including 7-of-14 shooting from 3-point range, and De'Aaron Fox added 28 points and 12 assists for the Kings, who have given up 130 or more points in four of their last five games. ""It's not exciting for me, watching guys just tee it up and go right down the lane over and over and over,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""We've got to get better individually guarding the basketball, and we've got to get a little bit more active in our help."" Fox said the Thunder turned things around after two losses to the Kings by using their height advantage. ""We see teams trying to crash (the boards) a lot more than they did earlier in the season because they were worried about us running,"" Fox said. ""We just have to stop giving up offensive rebounds and second-chance points."" It was a matchup of short-handed teams. The Kings were missing Iman Shumpert, Marvin Bagley III and Bogdan Bogdanovic because of injuries, while Oklahoma City guards Raymond Felton and Dennis Schroder were serving one-game suspensions for leaving the bench area during a scuffle with the Chicago Bulls on Monday. George had 19 points, Westbrook scored 17 and Adams added 14 in the first half, and the Thunder held a 71-52 lead at the break. Oklahoma City maintained a double-digit advantage for most of the third quarter, though the Kings pulled within nine entering the fourth quarter. The Thunder opened the final period with a 9-0 run -- with all the points coming from George -- and had a comfortable lead the rest of the way. ""We were getting some really good stops, so we didn't have to do anything tricky,"" Adams said. ""We were just more disciplined than they were and they missed a lot of shots."" TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook also had six steals. ... Adams had a double-double by halftime with 14 points and 15 rebounds. ... OKC missed seven of its first 14 free throws, including five straight misses in less than two minutes of the second quarter by Westbrook. ... The Thunder broke a three-game road losing streak. ... Jerami Grant had 22 points. Kings: Had won their two previous games this season against the Thunder, by 131-120 in Oklahoma City on Oct. 21 and 117-113 in Sacramento on Nov. 19.

AILING KINGS Shumpert (bruised right hip) and Bogdanovic (sore right foot) were both listed as day-to-day, while Bagley (bruised left knee) is expected to miss about another week.

"MIAMI --  The plan for the Miami Heat on the game's final play was simple: Do not let James Harden win the game for Houston. Dwyane Wade and the Heat pulled it off. Wade ran at Harden and got him to give the ball up as the clock ran down, Eric Gordon missed a 3-pointer -- one that Wade said he tipped ever so slightly -- as time expired, and the Heat held off the Rockets 101-99 on Thursday night for their first three-game winning streak of the season. ""If somebody else hit it, we would deal with it,"" Wade said. ""But it wasn't going to be James Harden."" Harden scored 35 for the Rockets, whose five-game winning streak was snapped. The worst part of the night for Houston, however, will likely be the loss of point guard Chris Paul in the second quarter to a strained left hamstring. All the Rockets know, for now, is that Paul will miss time. He will undergo an MRI on Friday to determine the severity and likely timetable for returning. ""We lose a guy of the magnitude of Chris, now we're fighting again,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""And the flaws that we have are going to come out again and we've got to overcome those."" Josh Richardson scored 22 points and Tyler Johnson added 19 for the Heat, who were up by 16 early, then wasted an 11-point lead in the fourth before rallying. Gordon's 3-pointer with 37 seconds left got Houston within two, and the Rockets got a stop on a long ensuing Heat possession. Wade missed, Hassan Whiteside got the offensive rebound and Wade wound up missing again, with the Rockets finally corralling the ball with 3.8 seconds left. The last play eventually went to Gordon, and his 3 -- Houston's 54th attempt of the night from beyond the arc -- was off, and Miami escaped. The Heat are 4-4 this season when shooting under 40 percent; the rest of the NBA, combined, is 9-103 in such games. ""Our identity is trying to make it ugly,"" Tyler Johnson said. ""A lot of teams aren't used to that."" Derrick Jones Jr. scored 15 for Miami, which got 11 from James Johnson and 10 from Wade. Gordon scored 20 for the Rockets, who got 14 from PJ Tucker and 10 from Danuel House Jr. The Rockets set an NBA record with 26 makes from 3-point range in Washington on Wednesday, and connected on another 18 in this one. The 44 made 3s in a two-game span are second-most in NBA history over such a stretch -- Houston made 46 in a two-game stretch of the 2016-17 season -- and are the most ever posted in consecutive days. But in this one, the Rockets needed one more. ""In those situations you've always got to be ready and I've hit those shots many of times,"" Gordon said. ""It just didn't go in for me."" Houston led by 16 early, then used a 13-1 run to erase an 11-point deficit in the fourth. Tyler Johnson got a layup to snap Miami's six-minute field-goal drought, then blocked a layup try by Harden and followed that with a 3 for a four-point edge. And with 1:20 left, Wade used the same move he's used for 16 seasons -- the shot fake on the wing -- to induce Gordon into a foul that he turned into two free throws for a 101-96 lead. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston led 45-38 when Paul went to the locker room. ... Houston is 1-7 this season when Paul and Harden aren't together, and going back to last season the Rockets have lost nine in a row when Paul isn't on the floor. ... Harden had 12 assists, and was 15 for 18 from the foul line. Heat: Justise Winslow (sore right ankle) didn't play. ... The Heat held Houston to 35 percent shooting and outrebounded the Rockets 62-41. STREAK ENDS Whiteside didn't record a blocked shot, ending a 26-game streak going back to last season. KNIGHT HOMECOMING Houston's Brandon Knight was born in Miami and played his high school ball in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Thursday marked his first appearance in an NBA game at Miami since March 2, 2015. Knight didn't play last season after tearing his ACL in a summer pro league game at Miami in July 2017.","401071148"
"LOS ANGELES --  Lou Williams' return from injury provided a much-needed lift for the Los Angeles Clippers. The 6-foot-1 guard, who missed the past four games due to a sore left hamstring, scored 13 of his 26 points during the fourth quarter to help the Clippers hold off the Dallas Mavericks 125-121 on Thursday night and snap a four-game losing streak. ""It was a good game for me,"" Williams said. ""It's good to get a win. We've had a rough stretch of games and it is good to move forward."" Maxi Kieber's jumper put the Mavericks up 109-104 with 5:14 remaining before the Clippers regained control with a 15-2 run. Danilo Gallinari, who led the Clippers with 32 points, had nine points during the rally and Williams made a pair of free throws with 3:08 remaining to give the Clippers a 113-111 lead, which they wouldn't relinquish. That was part of 12 straight Los Angeles points that gave the Clippers an eight-point lead with 1:02 remaining. Dallas, which has dropped its last four, made a late run to get within 123-121 but Tobias Harris made a pair of free throws to ice it. ""Lou was fantastic. Early on I thought his passing was fantastic and then he started the scoring barrage down the stretch,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He gives us a confidence when you have him on the floor. It's not necessarily you are going to go to him but he is going to be involved."" Rookie Luka Doncic scored a season-high 32 points for the Mavericks and JJ Barea added 19. DeAndre Jordan had 11 points and 22 rebounds in his first game back at Staples Center against his former team. ""He was great. He made a lot of plays and made a lot of shots,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said of Doncic. ""He got to the free throw line a lot. An awful lot (9 of 13). He made a lot of good things happen."" Dallas trailed 89-82 at the start of the fourth quarter before scoring eight straight points to take the lead, with six coming from Devin Harris. That would be the first of six lead changes and four ties over the final 10 minutes. Los Angeles led 32-30 early in the second quarter before scoring seven straight points. The Clippers would lead by as many as 13 late in the quarter before going to halftime up 65-54. Dallas trailed 69-58 less than three minutes into the third quarter before it started to steadily whittle down the deficit. Doncic scored six points during an 8-1 run that got the Mavericks within four. Devin Harris' layup with 1:14 remaining drew the Mavericks within 85-82 before the Clippers scored the final four points of the quarter. TIP-INS Mavericks: G Dennis Smith Jr. (right wrist sprain) missed his eighth game. ... Doncic has scored 20 or more points in 16 games this season. ... Harrison Barnes scored 14 of his 16 points in the first half. ... Harris added 13 points. Clippers: Los Angeles had its second-best shooting game of the season, making 56.6 percent from the field (47 of 83). It made 59 percent against New Orleans on Dec. 3. . ... Montrezl Harrell scored 14 of his 18 points in the first half. ... Harris had 16 points and nine rebounds. He made all eight of his free-throw attempts. JORDAN'S RETURN The Clippers played a video thanking Jordan for his 10 seasons with the franchise during the first timeout. It was Jordan's third game in Staples Center this season, but this was the first time it came against his former club. Jordan, who opted out of his contract with the Clippers during the offseason and signed a one-year deal with Dallas, holds the Clippers' record for most games played, field goal percentage, rebounds and blocked shots. ""I wish we won the game, but it was fun to be back in front of Clippers fans,"" Jordan said. ""I watched a little bit of the video. I thought it was great. I really appreciate those guys doing that."" Rivers said that he hopes the franchise eventually retires Jordan's jersey. ""It all started with him. When you think of the LA Clippers you think of DeAndre,"" Rivers said.","401071149"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  When asked about the last time he made seven 3-pointers in a game, Marvin Williams paused for several seconds and then finally responded, ""High school?"" That was a long time ago for the 32-year-old Williams. The 13-year veteran found his shooting stroke on Friday night, making a career-high 7 of 11 shots from beyond the arc on the way to a season-high 24 points as the Charlotte Hornets beat the Detroit Pistons for the third time this season, 98-86. ""He was sniping tonight,"" teammate Jeremy Lamb said. The Hornets skipped their morning shootaround, and Williams said he reported to the game feeling fresh. Detroit's Reggie Bullock said the Pistons suffered defensive breakdowns in guarding Williams. ""He's a pick-and-popper,"" Bullock said. ""We've just got to be able to rotate to him quicker or whatever we want to do to be able to get to him a lot quicker. He had a lot of open looks and he was shooting pretty quick, so we just have to do better with our switches or peel-backs or whatever we call it to be able to get back to shooters."" When Hornets coach James Borrego speaks of Williams, he normally uses one word: pro. ""He's at the core of who we are,"" Borrego said. ""I'm really proud of him, he shot the ball well and his teammates were looking for him. He was locked and loaded tonight."" Kemba Walker finished with 22 points on 9-of-17 shooting and hit two 3-pointers down the stretch to seal Charlotte's second straight win at home. The Hornets moved back ahead of the Pistons for sixth place in the Eastern Conference. Blake Griffin had 23 points, and Andre Drummond had 17 points and 16 rebounds for the Pistons, who shot 39 percent from the floor and scored their fewest points of the season. The Hornets opened a 15-point lead in the third quarter behind 13 points by Williams. But Pistons would cut the lead to three with five minutes left in the game after the Hornets missed their first eight shots of the fourth quarter. Enter Lamb. Lamb, who beat the Pistons on a last-second jumper 10 days ago, shook off a cold shooting night and scored on a driving left-handed layup and then buried a deep 3-pointer. Walker then connected on back-to-back 3s, the first coming after shaking off a defender. Walker even seemed to impress himself, smiling wide and holding his hands over his head mouthing the words ""Oh my!"" After his second, he ran back down the court lifting his legs high in the air while pumping his arms, knowing he had all but sealed the game. TIP-INS Pistons: Bench was outscored 36-23. ... Shot 23.5 percent from 3-point range. .. Only made 14 of 22 free throws. Hornets: Cody Zeller fouled out with 4:17 left and the Hornets leading 83-78. ... Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 12 points and Willy Hernangomez had 11 off the bench. NOT UP TO SATISFACTION Pistons coach Dwane Casey wasn't pleased with his team's effort. ""Our give-a-crap level was very low,"" Casey said. ""For a very important game like tonight, when you are a winner you come out and take this game and come ready to fight. I'll take the blame for it. I didn't get our team ready enough to come out and compete and fight."" DEFENSE STEPS UP Borrego said it was his team's best defensive effort of the season. ""We found a group of men that's committed to the defensive end these last two games,"" Borrego said. ""Four fast-break points for them, 46 points in the paint, I think that was our low for the season for opponent points at 86. ... I think we made a lot strides defensively these last few days and that's what's got to sustain us, competing on both ends of the floor.""","401071150"
"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors keep rolling along despite missing a couple key players because of injuries. Having Kawhi Leonard on the court certainly helps. Leonard matched his season high with 37 points, helping the Raptors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 126-110 on Friday night. OG Anunoby equaled his career high with 21 points as Toronto improved its NBA-leading record to 25-9. Pascal Siakam had 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Fred VanVleet scored 14 points. The short-handed Raptors won their second straight despite injuries to three starters. Guard Kyle Lowry missed his fourth straight game because of a sore left thigh, and center Serge Ibaka was sidelined by a sore right knee for the second straight game. Guard Danny Green was shelved by a sore left knee after starting Toronto's first 33 games. Raptors coach Nick Nurse said he has been impressed with the way his team has responded to the rash of injuries. ""I think we're handling it really well,"" Nurse said. ""We're having to do a lot of different things, play a lot of different lineups, a little bit different style here and there."" Siakam said the Raptors are trying to stay positive. ""All of us are waiting for opportunities to be on the floor,"" he said. ""It's tough to have three starters out but, at the same time, it's another day in the NBA, it's another game, so we've got to go out there and play it."" Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points for Cleveland, and Larry Nance Jr. had 16 points and 12 rebounds. Collin Sexton scored 17 points, and Cedi Osman finished with 12. The Cavaliers lost for the fourth time in five games. They also dropped to 3-13 on the road. Cleveland had injury problems of its own. Rodney Hood was limited to 17 minutes because of a sore left foot, and David Nwaba turned his left ankle in the second quarter and played only 14 minutes. ""Both guys are obviously a big part of what we do, they're starters,"" coach Larry Drew said. ""We had to kind of switch some things up."" Leonard shot 12 for 16 from the field and went 11 for 12 at the free-throw line. He was working out after the game and did not speak to the media. Toronto had a 102-97 lead with 7:36 remaining when Anunoby drove for a powerful one-handed dunk. After VanVleet stole the ball from Sexton, Siakam converted a layup to put the Raptors up by nine points. Clarkson made a pair of free throws and Nance dunked to cut the gap to five again, but Leonard replied with a three-point play, and then teamed with VanVleet to hit back-to-back 3s. ""I thought our guys put up a good fight,"" Drew said. ""For 3 1/2 quarters we did some good things. We just couldn't overcome them."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's reserves scored 53 points. ... Matthew Dellavedova led Cleveland with six assists. Raptors: VanVleet led Toronto with eight assists while Anunoby matched his career high with eight rebounds. ... Toronto used its 12th starting lineup of the season, with VanVleet, Wright and Anunoby joining regulars Leonard and Siakam. ... Toronto sold out its 200th consecutive game, a streak that began in November 2014. CAN'T COME BACK Cleveland is 0-18 when trailing at halftime. HIGH-SCORING Toronto scored 120 or more for the 14th time, more than anyone else in the league. STILL SITTING Leonard will sit against the 76ers on Saturday, Nurse said. Leonard has not played in both ends of a back-to-back yet this season after an injury-wracked season last year. Nurse said there's a chance Green and Lowry could return Saturday, but Ibaka is not expected to play.","401071151"
"NEW YORK --  After winning seven straight, Indiana head coach Nate McMillan noticed his team was developing some bad tendencies in their late-game execution. The Pacers gave up a buzzer-beating tip-in basket in Tuesday night's one-point loss to Cleveland. The following night, they squandered a 17-point lead in a tough loss at Toronto. Star guard Victor Oladipo then changed things around in a six-minute span in Brooklyn on Friday night. Oladipo scored 14 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, Thaddeus Young added 21, and the Pacers won 114-106, ending the Nets' seven-game winning streak. ""In the NBA you have to (put it behind) if you want to be good because stuff like this happens, unfortunately,"" said Oladipo, who added nine rebounds and six assists. Oladipo was tough on himself after a couple of personal mistakes doomed his team. He missed a pair of free throws with 10 seconds left against the Cavaliers and then turned the ball over twice in the last minute against the Raptors. Those games are in the past now. ""You might lose one game, you might lose two, three, but how you respond to the next game (is what matters),"" he said. ""It's a new game, it's a new day. All you got to do is just learn from the last games apply to the current game. It's easier than done, but the good teams can do it."" Bojan Bogdanovic and Domantas Sabonis each added 17 points for the Pacers. Indiana has played 77 straight games without losing three in a row. ""You try to figure it out after two losses,"" McMillan said. ""I thought tonight we did that."" Rookie Rodions Kurucs, a 2018 second-round draft pick, continued his stellar improvement with a season-high 26 points for Brooklyn, and DeMarre Carroll added 16. The Nets struggled in the first half, giving up 37 points in the first quarter, before turning things around late in the second half. ""We could really never stop them,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We didn't stop them all night."" Kurucs hit a free throw with 4:07 left in the game that gave Brooklyn a 100-98 lead before Oladipo accounted for all of Indiana's scoring in an 8-4 run that put the Pacers ahead 106-104. Oladipo punctuated the spurt with an impressive left-handed dunk over Kurucs with 2:01 left. Bogdanovic then hit a 3-pointer that extended the lead to 109-104. On the next Brooklyn possession, Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie was blocked by on a driving layup attempt by Pacers center Myles Turner, and Darren Collinson was then fouled by Kurucs. Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson came running off the bench to argue the call and was immediately ejected with 1:09 left by referee Tony Brothers. Bogdanovic hit the technical free throw to widen the lead to six points. Collinson hit one of his two free throws to make it 111-104. Kurucs then answered with a pair of free throws to draw the Nets with five before Oladipo's final basket, a 3-pointer, closed it out for Indiana. TIP INS Pacers: Turner had 15 points and 12 rebounds. Nets: G Joe Harris has hit at least a 3-pointer in 30 consecutive games, a game short of tying Joe Johnson's franchise record of 31 straight set during the 2012-13 season. FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING Kurucs led the Nets in scoring for the first time in his career, shooting 6 for 11 from the field over 34 minutes. He had 15 of his 26 points in the second half, providing a spark for a Nets offense that trailed by 10 points at halftime. ""It's hard to take him out of the game,"" Atkinson said. ""It wasn't the plan to play him 34 minutes, and he's earning his minutes. He's earning his play, and it's a pleasant, pleasant surprise for a 20-year-old kid.""","401071152"

Bazemore scored 22 points, John Collins had 17 points and 16 rebounds, and the Hawks rallied to beat the New York Knicks 114-107 on Friday night. Atlanta trailed 39-28 after one quarter, but held New York to 38 points in the second half of its second straight win. ""For our guys to make a stand defensively was great to see,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. The Hawks had seven players score in double figures. Trae Young had 15 points and 10 assists, and Kevin Huerter finished with 16 points. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 32 points, but the Knicks dropped their fourth consecutive game. Kevin Knox scored 17 of his 24 points in the first quarter. New York also blew a halftime lead in Monday's 128-110 loss to Phoenix. ""For whatever reason, we are hitting the wall in that third quarter,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""That's our new quarter for some reason. We look fatigued and we stop moving the ball. Everything that was sharp in the first half, kind of fades out in the second. We have to figure it out."" Mudiay's layup gave New York a 99-95 lead with 7:23 left, but Atlanta responded with a 9-0 run. Young capped the decisive stretch with a layup with 3:47 left. After Mudiay hit a jumper for the Knicks, Young converted a three-point play to extend the Hawks' lead to 107-101 with 3:04 remaining. ""These teams are desperate to get wins just like we're desperate to get wins,"" Knox said. ""You could just tell in that second half they came out to try and win the game and we come out a little sluggish. They come out with a certain type of energy that we just don't respond to.""

"BOSTON --  The Milwaukee Bucks turned their slow start into a long, frustrating night for the Boston Celtics. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 30 points and got the Bucks rolling on an early 16-0 run that put Milwaukee in command for good in a 120-107 win over the short-handed Celtics on Friday night. ""We just tried to play a bit harder, a bit sharper,"" said Antetokounmpo, who also had eight rebounds and five assists. Khris Middleton had 21 points and nine rebounds, Tony Snell scored 15 and Thon Maker added 12 points for Milwaukee, which has won six of seven. After falling behind 10-1 in the first quarter, Antetokounmpo got Milwaukee's first field goal 2:99 into the game on a dunk that started the Bucks on a 16-point run and dazed the Celtics, who never recovered. ""We haven't lost twice to the same team this year,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's a good feeling, coming in here and getting a win in here because they play so well at home."" Kyrie Irving had 15 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the Celtics, whose frustrations after their third straight loss carried over and led to a lengthy closed-door meeting in the locker room after the game. ""It is something that we will keep in the locker room,"" said Jayson Tatum, who scored 20 for Boston. ""It's not something for everybody to know what we talked about. We just have to be better as a team."" The Celtics were missing their top two centers and forward Marcus Morris. Milwaukee capitalized on its advantage inside all night. ""As you dig a hole against them, it's hard to come back. They're a heck of a team,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Malcom Brogdon had 10 points and nine rebounds and Antetokounmpo pulled down eight boards for the Bucks, who finished with a 55-36 rebounding advantage. Boston also sent Antetokounmpo to the foul line 17 times, and he made 13 free throws. With Milwaukee controlling the paint, the Celtics were forced outside and made just 10 of 34 attempts from 3-point range and were 34 for 91 overall. ""They missed a lot of shots,"" Bledsoe said. ""I'm pretty sure they got a pretty good amount up -- they just missed a lot of them. We did a great job of scrambling tonight."" The Celtics have lost three straight since winning eight in a row. Jaylen Brown scored 21 for Boston. Gordon Hayward had 11 points and and Semi Ojeleye finished with 10 points, getting the start at center with Al Horford and Aron Baynes both out with injuries. Milwaukee dominated the first half after the slow start, using a 9-0 run late in the second quarter to pull ahead by as much as 26 points. Boston made a few runs in the second half but was never able to get the margin closer than 11. Brown's dunk with 9:43 left pulled Boston within 97-82, but he was called for a technical for flexing his muscles after the dunk and Brogdon made the ensuing free throw. Brown made a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 103-90, and then Rozier made a steal and started on a fast break with Hayward, who spun a layup off the backboard while drawing a foul. Hayward missed the free throw and a chance at the three-point play. TALK IT OUT Boston's locker room remained closed for nearly 40 minutes after the game ended. Players wouldn't get into specifics about what was said, but it was clear that inconsistent play following the eight-game winning streak was one of the topics discussed. ""It was well needed,"" Brown said. ""It was definitely well needed and we're trying to move forward in the right direction.""

"CHICAGO --  Whether it was driving inside for a poster-worthy dunk or burying 3-pointers, Lauri Markkanen did exactly what the Chicago Bulls needed him to do. Markkanen scored a season-high 32 points and the Bulls won for just the third time in 15 games, beating the Magic 90-80 on Friday night. ""I think I can do multiple things, so take one thing away from me I can do other stuff,"" he said. ""I think we did a good job of recognizing their coverages, using that to our advantage."" Markkanen was 12 for 20 from the field in his 10th game since missing the start of the season with a right elbow injury. The 7-footer also went 4 for 6 from beyond the arc. Robin Lopez had 14 points for Chicago. Kris Dunn added 12 points and seven assists, and Justin Holiday finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Orlando lost for the fifth time in its last seven games. Evan Fournier scored 24 points, and Nikola Vucevic had 19 points and 19 rebounds after missing a game for the birth of his son. The Magic posted their second-lowest point total of the season while shooting just under 33 percent. They didn't exactly help themselves on defense, either. ""They're a scrappy team and they play hard,"" said Aaron Gordon, who scored 14 points for Orlando on 4-for-17 shooting. ""But this is a game that we gave away. We didn't do what we need to do on offense. We didn't take care of defense. We just came out there, I don't know what we were thinking. Obviously, we weren't ready to play the game and that's a disappointing loss."" Markkanen hit the 30-point mark for the third time in his career. He shook off a slow start after taking just six shots in a 96-93 loss to Brooklyn on Wednesday. He had the crowd roaring in the third quarter when he drove for a hard dunk on Vucevic. The Bulls led by as many as 15. Vucevic's turnaround jumper got Orlando within five with 1:37 remaining, but Markkanen hit a jumper and two foul shots to help seal the game for Chicago. ""Well, I just think he was aggressive,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""I think we tried to move him around a little bit, get him to his spots. He's a great kid, he's coachable. He wants to do the right thing. He's coming back ... so it's gonna be a process. He's still a young player. But he was competitive and he was aggressive.

"SAN ANTONIO --  There truly is no place like home lately for the San Antonio Spurs, especially after some struggles at the start of the month. Bryn Forbes scored 22 points and the Spurs set season highs with 19 3-pointers and 36 assists in a 124-98 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. San Antonio won for the seventh time in eight games, and held an opponent under 100 points for the seventh straight time. It's a needed change for the Spurs, who opened the month by losing three of four by 30-plus points. ""We had a lot of ups and downs at the beginning of the season, which was expected,"" San Antonio guard DeMar DeRozan said. ""We just stayed patient, continued to chip away at it. We had a great opportunity to come back home in December and having a home stand to try to get our rhythm going and that's where we are at."" The Spurs have led by at least 20 points in each of its last eight games, and joined the 1972 Milwaukee Bucks as the only teams in league history to have five straight wins by 25-plus points. Minnesota, which has lost 11 straight in San Antonio, has dropped six of seven games overall. Andrew Wiggins scored 15 points to lead the Timberwolves, and Karl-Anthony Towns and Robert Covington had 13 each. The Spurs' run of blowout losses began Nov. 28 at Minnesota with a 128-89 defeat. San Antonio has since adjusted its schemes to help the team defensively and the changes have made an impact. ""Honestly, I'm enjoying it more, its making things lot easier (since the changes),"" Forbes said. ""Especially playing a lot more as a team now. Everybody is in the right positions, and I think we're going the right way. We struggled for a bit, and I think we're finally kind of figuring it out."" The defensive energy is also helping the team offensively. San Antonio was 19 for 33 on 3-pointers and shot 53 percent from the field. Marco Belinelli had 17 points and Davis Bertans added 15 while combining to shoot 10 for 16 on 3s. ""(The Timberwolves) were really, really helping and shifting on defense,"" Bertans said. ""We had some good looks already after the first pass but then driving and kicking we could find pretty anything wide open."" Minnesota also gave up 14 3s to Sacramento on Monday and 20 to Detroit on Wednesday. ""We've got to close out with high hands and run them off the 3-point line and stay to the scouting report,"" Wiggins said. ""We say some people shouldn't get 3s and run them off the line. We've just got to keep running them off the line and not short step it."" Minnesota only led for 22 seconds off a 3-foot hook by Taj Gibson with 6:55 remaining in the first quarter for an 11-10 advantage. Rudy Gay scored 14 points, DeMar DeRozan added 12 and LaMarcus Aldridge 10 as the Spurs were able to rest their starters for much of the fourth quarter. Timberwolves starting point guard Derrick Rose did not play in the second half due to a sore left ankle. Rose had four points, two rebounds and an assist in 16 minutes. Rose, who is unsure if he will be available for Sunday's game at Oklahoma City, said his ankle hurt prior to the game. ""Just sore, really sore,"" Rose said. ""I'll take it as a case of me not really listening to my body."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jeff Teague missed his third straight game due to left foot soreness. Teague was averaging 9.3 points and 10.1 assists in December prior to the injury. ... Minnesota did not have a single player score in double figures in the first half. Tyus Jones was the team's leading scorer at the time with eight points. ... The Timberwolves are 0-6 when scoring fewer than 100 points.

Their season high for a half is 11 against New Orleans. LIGHTING IT UP Belinelli doesn't have any aspirations of competing in the 3-point contest at the All-Star Game on Feb. 17 in Charlotte. ""Nah, I don't know. I just want to win (games),"" Belinelli said. ""I already won one (3-point contest) in New Orleans. I'm OK with that. I would like to win a championship, I think that's more important."" HAVE A SEAT The Spurs' blowouts have afforded DeRozan the luxury of sitting for most of the fourth quarter, which he is enjoying. ""It's great to sit out the fourth quarters, be able to rest, especially for me,"" DeRozan said. ""At one point I think I was leading the league in minutes. Being able to sit out some fourth quarters and just to be out there and cheer them guys on is always the fun part.""","401071156"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  After struggling early amid high expectations, the Utah Jazz feel like they're finding their rhythm once again. Ricky Rubio had 24 points and eight assists to lead the Utah Jazz to a 120-90 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. Kyle Korver scored 18 points and Jae Crowder added 16 as the two combined to shoot 7 for 14 on 3-pointers. The win for Utah follows a home win over the defending two-time champion Golden State Warriors and takes them into a stretch where they'll play 12 of their next 17 games at home. ""We've been playing better for the last couple weeks or so and I think the results are coming,"" Rubio said. ""We feel pretty confident where we are at."" According to guard Donovan Mitchell, the key for Utah has been the defense. ""Defensively, we were locked in,"" Mitchell said. ""We've been locked in on the defensive end the last two games and we've got to keep it up."" Damian Lillard had 19 points to lead the Trail Blazers, who suffered their worst home loss since 2004. The teams will face off again soon when the Blazers visit the Jazz on Christmas Day. ""They played a good game, we'll see them in a few days,"" Lillard said. The Jazz took control of the game in the first quarter thanks to reserves Korver and Crowder. The two helped the Jazz take a 2-point lead early in the second and the advantage. That's also where Portland coach Terry Stotts saw the game slip away. ""The end of the first quarter I thought really changed the tone of the game,"" Stotts said. ""We gave up 15 points in a 3-minute stretch on some mental lapses that shouldn't have happened."" The Jazz took a 12-point early in the second quarter, led by 14 after three before pulling away in the fourth. Crowder and Korver seemingly alternated 3-point baskets while back-up point guard Dante Exum racked up assist after assist setting them up. Exum finished with seven assists and six points. Things only got better for the Jazz from there as their strong 3-point shooting did not stop. Utah finished 16 for 31 (51 percent) on 3s. Everybody from the bench players, to unheralded shooters like Rubio, got open 3s to go. Unfortunately for Portland, that has been a theme for them this season as they rank 29th out of 30 teams in opponent's 3-point percentage. ""We've given up a high percentage of 3s and they shot them well. It's the NBA,"" Lillard said. ""I don't know how much you can say it's luck. It's the NBA. You give up those looks, guys are going to make them. Teams have been hurting us with it."" While things were going well for the Jazz, the Blazers were struggling. They shot 41 percent from the field and 31 percent from long-distance. Their turnovers were also costly as the Jazz scored 21 points off Portland turnovers. One sequence in particular seemed to encapsulate the night for Portland as Lillard missed a dunk and then upon getting the rebound, threw the ball to teammate Jusuf Nurkic, who was standing near the bench but not in the game. TIP-INS Jazz: Donovan Mitchell hasn't had a very efficient shooting season, and he's shot even worse as of late. For the past seven games, he's been shooting 35 percent from the field, including 29 percent on 3s. Don't expect him to stop shooting. As coach Quin Snyder said before the game, he's being selfish if he doesn't shoot. ""He's got to play, he's got to attack,"" Snyder said. ""He's our guy. You start questioning that, he's fine. We won a game and he didn't shoot great. He's not going to shoot great at times but there's been plenty of games when he's had a rough night. He's capable of doing that for him, that's what we want. If he doesn't shoot, that's Donovan being selfish."" Mitchell was 1 for 10 from the field against the Blazers. Trail Blazers: After a brief swoon, the Trail Blazers entered the game having won three straight. A big key to the success was the play of the reserves. That is something Stotts believes is an indicator. ""That group has done a good job of Evan (Turner), Seth (Curry), Nik (Stauskas), Zach (Collins), Meyers (Leonard), have all done a good job of keeping things going,"" he said. ""We had a rough stretch and our record kind of reflected that but two out of the last three games."" On Friday, however, they were significantly outplayed by the Jazz reserves.","401071157"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Buddy Hield watched Mike Conley put on an impressive shooting display for three quarters. Then he spoiled Conley's big night with his own hot streak. Hield made four of his six 3-pointers over the final 8 1/2 minutes and scored 16 points in the fourth quarter to help the Sacramento Kings rally for a 102-99 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday. Hield finished with 28 points. De'Aaron Fox had 14 points, eight assists and made two key free throws down the stretch for Sacramento. ""We had a lot of grit and a lot of fight,"" Hield said. ""Guys wanted it. We played together and we just had fun. We made some shots and we got some stops."" The Kings trailed 82-75 with 9 minutes left when Hield started to heat up. He scored 11 consecutive points for Sacramento, including three straight 3s, to cut the gap to 90-86. Marc Gasol made two free throws to give Memphis a 97-93 lead with 2:20 left, but Sacramento responded with nine straight points. Hield sparked the decisive run with a 3-pointer and made two foul shots to make it 102-97 with 3.9 seconds remaining. ""He's a scorer and at some point in every game a scorer's going to get on a roll,"" Fox said of Hield. ""It's bound to happen. There's a lot of guys in the league that can really do that, and he's the guy on our team that really does that well."" Bogdan Bogdanovic had 14 points for the Kings, who had dropped three of four. Willie Cauley-Stein added 12 points and 13 rebounds. The end of the game was delayed briefly after Hield was called for goaltending on a Shelvin Mack layup. Officials reviewed the play and put .5 seconds back on the clock, but Gasol had already retreated to the locker room and had to be called back out to finish the game. ""At the end of the game we made too many mistakes defensively,"" Gasol said. ""They took that momentum and finished the game on their terms."" Conley had 23 points and seven rebounds for Memphis, which has lost five straight and seven of eight. Conley also tied his career high with seven 3-pointers, two shy of the Grizzlies' single-game record. Temple scored 17 points against his former team while Gasol and Jaren Jackson had 12 points apiece. Memphis has been held under 100 points in eight consecutive games and 10 of 11. ""The entire second half we made mistake after mistake after mistake,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We didn't deserve to win this game. It's time for all of us to be fed up with what's going on, hold ourselves accountable."" Iman Shumpert scored 11 consecutive points in the second quarter to help the Kings trim a 19-point deficit to 53-40 at halftime. Shumpert had missed the previous three games for a variety of reasons, including a right hip contusion. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis made 16 3-pointers, one shy of the franchise record. ... Joakim Noah did not play for a second straight game due to right heel soreness. Kings: The 40 points were Sacramento's season low for a half. ... Nemanja Bjelica picked up a technical foul in the second quarter and a Flagrant 1 foul in the third. ... Marvin Bagley III continues to be sidelined by a left knee bone bruise. The second overall pick has not played since getting hurt early against Golden State on Dec. 14. Bagley is scheduled to be re-evaluated next week. ... Bogdanovic was back in the lineup after sitting out Wednesday with a sore right foot. OVER 1,000 Conley added to his franchise record for career 3-pointers and now has 1,003. COMEBACK KIDS The Kings have won four games this season when trailing entering the fourth quarter. ""That's a Memphis team that needed to get this one, they knew it, they were locked in,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""I don't know but maybe we stole one.""","401071158"
"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James got plenty of attention this week for his comments about Anthony Davis, prompting allegations of tampering and ramping up speculation about the two superstars playing together for the Los Angeles Lakers. It turns out James is also pretty good at playing with his current teammates. James had 22 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds, and the Lakers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 112-104 on Friday night. ""I'm a playmaker by nature, and nature kind of took over,"" said James, who got his third triple-double in his first season with the Lakers and No. 76 for his career. Kyle Kuzma had 23 points, and Ivica Zubac set season highs with 16 points and 11 rebounds, helping Los Angeles to its sixth consecutive home win. Davis had 30 points and 20 rebounds for the Pelicans, who lost their third straight game. Julius Randle had 21 points in his first game back at Staples Center against the Lakers after playing four seasons with them, and Jrue Holiday had 18 points and 10 assists. Davis and James shared the court for the first time since James recently declared in an interview with ESPN that it would be ""amazing"" if the Lakers traded for the Pelicans' biggest star. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said before the game that Davis will not be traded to the Lakers or anywhere else as long as he remains under contract to the Pelicans. But James showed why players around the NBA might want to take him up on an invitation to join the Lakers by helping all five starters score in double figures. James had seven assists in the first quarter, his most in any quarter since joining the Lakers, and his infectious ball movement helped his new team get 20 assists on 27 made baskets in the first half. ""He's one of the best playmaker passers our game has ever had, and I think he sees how the game is going,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""For us, that allows guys to kind of start to get in a rhythm. If everyone sees the ball go through the net a couple times they feel good about themselves."" As pleased as he was with the offense in the first half, Walton was even more impressed with a defensive effort that limited the Pelicans to 39 points in the second half. New Orleans shot 32.6 percent in the second half, leaving Gentry more concerned about his fifth loss in seven games than whether or not James tampered with Davis. ""I think you feel the pressure when you're not winning games,"" Gentry said. ""We've not had a good two weeks."" STILL TALKING James made it clear after the game he wasn't happy about the furor over his comments and didn't plan on taking a vow of silence any time soon. ""Ask me would I like to play with Kevin Durant? Absolutely,"" James said. ""Ask if I'd like to play with Jimmy Butler. I'll say it right now. Ask about Kyrie Irving, Giannis. Ask me about Embiid, Ben Simmons, all of `em. Luka Doncic. Ask me right now. Come on, guys, it's not rocket science. These are great players, absolutely. I'd love to play with a lot of great players. It's just who I am. And I play by the rules."" NOT TALKING Davis took the opposite tact by brushing off James' comments after posting the second game in the NBA this season with at least 30 points, 20 rebounds and five assists. ""My job is to focus on winning and that's it,"" Davis said. ""Nothing else. My job is to help this team win, and as of late we haven't been doing that. Anything outside of that is white noise to me, honestly."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis had a bandage placed on his left pinkie finger during the first quarter and appeared to be trying to shake out the injury as the game went on. ... New Orleans committed 13 turnovers leading to 20 points for Los Angeles. The Pelicans got 11 points off 13 Lakers turnovers. ... Nikola Mirotic missed his fourth straight game because of an ankle injury. Lakers:  Zubac got the start with JaVale McGee missing his third straight game because of illness and scored eight of the Lakers' first 16 points. . Brandon Ingram scored 18 points after missing seven games because of a sprained left ankle. . Rajon Rondo had eight points and nine assists off the bench after missing 17 games because of surgery on his right hand.","401071159"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Denver Nuggets have hit a few bumps en route to the Western Conference's best record. Just not like this. Danilo Gallinari and Tobias Harris each scored 21 points, Montrezl Harrell added 20 and the Los Angeles Clippers beat Denver 132-111 on Saturday for the Nuggets' worst loss of the season. The Nuggets (21-10) had not lost by more than 10 points and had won four straight. ""That was a tough one,"" Nuggets forward Monte Morris said. ""The Clippers just wanted it a little bit more."" That was most obvious in the paint, where the hard-driving Clippers outscored the Nuggets 80-50. ""Eighty points is not a number I'm used to seeing on a stat sheet,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""That's just them beating us off the dribble. That's them rebounding every missed shot. That's them outworking us and (us) not being ready to compete at the level we needed to compete tonight."" The Clippers shot 57.6 percent from the field. ""I thought our tempo set the tone,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Our pace tonight (was) maybe as good as I've seen. I mean, we never stopped it. Just continued movement and pacing. I thought we did it throughout the game."" The Clippers went on a 15-4 run in the middle of the first quarter, but their cause was aided when Denver's leading scorer, Nikola Jokic, was ejected. He led the Nuggets with 19 points despite playing only 20 minutes. The Clippers led by 11 when the 7-foot Jokic was ejected in the third quarter for screaming at an official for the second time. Malone said he wasn't sure what Jokic had yelled to draw the ejection. ""You'd have to ask him,"" Malone said. Jokic did not make himself available to reporters after the game. After losing four consecutive games, the Clippers have won two straight. ""Our throw-out (ejection) defense is phenomenal,"" Rivers quipped. ""That was part of our gameplan."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver opened the season with a 107-98 victory over the Clippers. Rivers on the difference between the Nuggets then and now: ""They believe now,"" he said. ""And they're at that point, where it really doesn't matter who they have on the floor. That's how confident they've become."" Clippers: Rivers slipped and fell awkwardly on the sideline during Thursday's game against the Mavericks. At first he was concerned he had injured his knee, but now says it is fine. ""You know what my first thought was?"" Rivers said. ""On the off-days, I can't golf."" PAINT DOMINANCE Rivers said the Clippers controlling the inside game was not just a reflection of the Los Angeles frontline playing well, but also of guards driving aggressively to the basket. ""Just attacks,"" Rivers said. ""We played downhill."" MISSING BIG PIECE Jokic leads the Nuggets in scoring (18.2) and rebounding (10.0), and in his last five games had averaged 26.6 points and 12.8 rebounds. ""He's our best player,"" Morris said. ""When you lose him, it's tough. He usually initiates a lot of the offense. We couldn't call him back."" Jamal Murray had 18 points for Denver, and Morris 15.","401071160"
"WASHINGTON -- Bradley Beal and Kelly Oubre Jr. have matched up often in practice, and Oubre thought he knew what to expect in their reunion. Just one of a few surprises on a wild Saturday night. Beal had 40 points and his first career triple-double while squaring off against his former teammate, and the Washington Wizards beat the Phoenix Suns 149-146 in triple-overtime in the highest-scoring NBA game since 2008. ""I was telling him, I didn't know you were this hard to guard,"" Oubre said after his first game against Washington since he was traded to Phoenix last week. ""I'm chasing you around all these screens, I'm getting hit every possession but you still moving. ""He had an exceptional game and he willed them to the win tonight."" The 295 combined points were the most since the Denver Nuggets and Seattle SuperSonics totaled 298 in two overtimes on April 6, 2008. The record is Detroit's 186-184 triple-OT win over Denver in 1983. With All-Star point guard John Wall sidelined due to illness, Beal scored 10 points in the third overtime, including a slicing layup that made it 146-144 with 40 seconds left. He also had a career-high 15 assists and 11 rebounds, and reached the triple-double plateau by the end of the first overtime. He still had to play two more to help Washington to its second win in eight games. ""I will never try to go out and get a triple-double,"" Beal said. ""It's the hardest thing to do."" Thomas Bryant added a career-high 31 points, hit all 14 of his shots and made all three of his free throws. At one point, Bryant scored 16 of 18 points for Washington across a stretch of the first and second overtime. ""It's amazing,"" the second-year forward said. ""I had no idea. I was just in the flow of the game. I just let the game come to me, and as soon as I felt like I was in the rhythm of it, I just went out and took it."" Devin Booker had 33 points and 14 assists for the Suns, who ended their four-game winning streak after giving back a seven-point lead late in the fourth quarter. Deandre Ayton had 26 points and 17 rebounds for his fifth consecutive double-double but fouled out midway through the second overtime. After going scoreless for nearly a 10-minute stretch in overtime, Beal scored eight straight points for Washington in the third extra period. Later, he cut through several defenders for a layup that gave the Wizards the lead for good, 146-144. ""When your best player is not playing, the other guys take on more responsibilities,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Beal was, he came ready and understanding that his role tonight was going to be different."" Tomas Satoransky and Jeff Green combined to make 3 of 4 free throws, with Booker hitting a leaning shot on the other end. Booker tried to set up T.J. Warren for a tying 3-pointer, but Warren's shot came after the buzzer. Beal missed a potential winning floater to end the first overtime period, and Booker had his shot from a similar spot rim out to end the second. WHO ARE THESE GUYS? With forwards Otto Porter (knee) and Dwight Howard (back) also remaining out, Beal was the only member of Washington's preseason projected starting five that played Saturday. ""It was definitely a gut check for us,"" Beal said. ""You look at our second group it was like a group of new guys out there. It was good for us to be able to adjust."" BIG-NAME COMPANY Bryant's 14-for-14 performance is among the best perfect shooting nights in NBA history. The only player to sink more field goals without a miss is Wilt Chamberlain, who reached 18, 16 and 15 in different games. WELCOME BACK Oubre entered to an ovation from the Washington crowd with 5:02 left in the first. After playing his first three-plus NBA seasons with the Wizards, Oubre was traded with Austin Rivers to Phoenix for Trevor Ariza last week. He finished with 20 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter or later. TIP-INS Suns: Have not won more than four in a row since winning six straight in December of 2014. ... Ayton has 20 double-doubles, the most by a rookie this season. Wizards: Beal recorded double-digit assists for the second time this season after contributing 11 in a loss at New Orleans on Nov. 28. ... He also had his third double-digit rebound game. He has never had more than three in a season.","401071161"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers weren't too excited after their latest win. Embiid had 27 points and 11 rebounds, Ben Simmons added 26 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and Philadelphia routed the short-handed Toronto Raptors 126-101 on Saturday night. JJ Redick added 22 points for the 76ers, who pulled within 2 1/2 games of first-place Toronto in the Atlantic Division. Pascal Siakam scored 26 points and Kyle Lowry added 20 for the Raptors, who slipped to 25-10. Toronto played without two-time defensive player of the year Kawhi Leonard, as well as Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas. And it's the absences that had Embiid downplaying the victory. ""It was a good win, but to me it doesn't mean anything,"" he said. Embiid scored 23 of his points in the opening 24 minutes. ""They really had nothing to stop him in the first half,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Leonard was held out of the lineup to rest on the second game of a back-to-back after scoring a season-high 37 points in the Raptors' 126-110 home win over Cleveland on Friday night. Toronto coach Nick Nurse said prior to Saturday's contest that Leonard may be available for the second game of a back-to-back going forward. Ibaka missed his third straight contest with a sore right knee, while Valanciunas is sidelined for at least three more weeks after having thumb surgery. Lowry and Danny Green returned after missing time with injuries. Lowry sat out the last four contests with a sore left thigh and Green watched Friday's win with a sore left knee. It was Philadelphia's third victory in the last 23 games against the Raptors. The 76ers, though, would've liked it to come against a full contingent. ""I was disappointed, too,"" said Simmons, whose point total was a season high. The Raptors led by as many as seven in the opening half and were within range entering the break trailing 65-59. But the 76ers took advantage of Toronto's many missing players in the second half, methodically pulling away. ""A little too much for us tonight,"" Nurse said. ""We just didn't have enough."" Philadelphia led by as many as 25 points in the fourth quarter. CHRISTMAS PRESENT The 76ers next play on Christmas night on Boston, something Embiid and Simmons are eagerly anticipating. ""I love playing against those guys,"" Embiid said. ""I like their physicality. I like their toughness. It's fun. We're going to have a blast."" Said Simmons: ""I think it's going to be an amazing experience."" CHRISTMAS COAL In spite of being one of the premier teams in the league, Toronto isn't one of the 10 clubs being featured on Christmas, something Nurse admitted was disappointing. ""I think it's a marquee day to play,"" he said. ""I think our team would've liked to play."" FULTZ UPDATE The 76ers are unsure if Markelle Fultz will play again this season. The 20-year-old Fultz was diagnosed this month with thoracic outlet syndrome and is doing physical therapy in Los Angeles. General manager Elton Brand said prior to Saturday's game against Toronto that he has no timetable for Fultz's return to basketball activities. Brand said it was ""to be determined"" if Fultz will play again this season. ""I can't say right now,"" Brand said. The GM expects to update Fultz's situation in ""a few weeks."" Fultz was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft, but his career has been sidetracked by injuries and ineffectiveness. TIP-INS Raptors: The Raptors won both previous meetings between the teams this season, 129-112 on Oct. 30, and 113-102 on Dec. 5. Both of those games were in Toronto, where the Raptors have won 13 in a row over Philadelphia. . Leonard has never lost in 12 career meetings with Philadelphia. 76ers: Former Eagles receiver Freddie Mitchell rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell in the pregame. . The teams will play once more in the regular season, on Feb. 5 in Philadelphia. ... Embiid, Simmons and Jimmy Butler all received technical fouls.","401071162"
"MIAMI --  This is what Miami coach Erik Spoelstra means when he says he wants everyone involved. This was one play for the Heat in the final moments Saturday night: James Johnson blocked a 3-point try by Milwaukee's Khris Middleton, the ball ricocheting to Justise Winslow, who knocked it to Josh Richardson, who tipped it to Dwyane Wade, who then tapped it forward to Richardson for a dunk. It was that kind of night for the Heat. With balanced offense, airtight defense and by completely frustrating Giannis Antetokounmpo, Miami extended its season-best winning streak to four games with a 94-87 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. ""We have to be able to commit to this,"" Spoelstra said. Antetokounmpo was held to nine points on 3-for-12 shooting, the Bucks shot 37 percent and scored the 87 points -- all season-lows. Milwaukee came in leading the NBA at nearly 118 points per game but scored only eight points in the first quarter, tying a franchise low for an opening period and setting a season-low for the entire NBA. Still, the Bucks clawed from 17 down to within one in the final minutes before Miami closed on a 12-6 run -- fueled in part by a couple of big mid-range jumpers from Wade. ""They tried to hit us first, they were physical with us,"" said Antetokounmpo, whose previous season-low was 12 points. ""We came from a back-to-back, but that's not an excuse for us. We didn't make shots, we had a lot of open looks that didn't go in, but just being able to stick around and be in the game and have a chance to win says a lot about this team."" Richardson scored 16 points and Wade had 13 for Miami. Hassan Whiteside had 11 points and 13 rebounds, and Kelly Olynyk and Johnson each scored 11 points for the Heat. Middleton scored 18 points and Eric Bledsoe added 17 for the Bucks, who shot 37 percent from the field -- and 9 for 43 from 3-point range. It was the sixth-worst 3-point percentage in NBA history for a team taking at least 40 shots from beyond the arc. Miami shot only 38 percent and improved to 5-4 when shooting under 40 percent this season, by far the best in the league in that department. The rest of the NBA has won about 9 percent of the time when shooting that percentage or worse. ""Just couldn't make a couple plays down the stretch,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Milwaukee got within 82-81 on a 3-pointer by Tony Snell with 2:42 left. Richardson made a pair of free throws, Wade had Miami's next four points on a pair of midrange jumpers, and the Heat finished on a 12-6 run with Richardson's dunk the exclamation point. ""Play of the game,"" Wade said. The Bucks missed 12 of their first 14 shots from the field and were 0 for 13 from 3-point range before finally getting one of those to fall. It tied a franchise-best for fewest points allowed in a first quarter by the Heat, and Antetokounmpo was held scoreless in an opening quarter for the second time in his last 129 games. The Bucks scored 30 points in the second quarter and took a 38-37 lead at the half, but Miami opened the third on a 14-2 run and kept the lead the rest of the way. Bledsoe said Wade's two late jumpers were the difference. ""D-Wade being D-Wade,"" Bledsoe said. TIP-INS Bucks: Even with the loss, the last time Milwaukee (22-10) got off to a better 32-game start to the season was 1990-91 (24-8). ... It was a tough turnaround, schedule-wise, for Milwaukee. The Bucks played an 8 p.m. game in Boston on Friday, and their plane didn't get to the gate in Miami until 3:34 a.m. Saturday. ""I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say this was one of the more unique (back-to-backs) I've seen in all my years,"" Budenholzer said. Heat: Miami outrebounded Milwaukee 56-48. ... The win was Miami's 500th regular-season victory at AmericanAirlines Arena, their home since Jan. 2, 2000. They're now 500-274. YEAR OF WAITING Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Dion Waiters' last appearance with the Heat. He hurt his left ankle in the first quarter of Miami's win over Dallas on Dec. 22, 2017, had surgery a few weeks later and hasn't played since.","401071163"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden took control for the Houston Rockets in the first game of what could be a lengthy period without point guard Chris Paul. Harden played a bruising 41 minutes and had 39 points, 10 assists, four rebounds and two steals as the Rockets defeated the San Antonio Spurs 108-101 and won for the first time this season without Paul. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni was asked where the line is between letting the reigning league MVP carry the team and putting too much on his plate. ""I haven't found the line yet -- I'm still looking for it,"" D'Antoni said. ""I can tell him afterward, but he has a better feeling about what he needs to do."" D'Antoni said Harden is playing in ""another atmosphere"" following his sixth straight game of scoring at least 30 points. After the Rockets let a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead slip and fell behind 97-96 with three minutes remaining, Harden scored nine of Houston's final 12 points, including two 3s, to close out the win. ""That's what we do,"" Harden said. ""We do it at a high level, we shoot the ball, we shoot it with confidence. Some are going to go in, some aren't. That's the way we play."" The Rockets were playing without Paul, who suffered a Grade-2 left hamstring strain on Thursday night in Miami and is expected to be out at least two-to-four weeks. Houston entered Saturday winless in five games without Paul this season. Clint Capela had 21 points and a season-high 23 rebounds, and Eric Gordon had 18 points on 4-of-12 shooting from 3-point range. Capela said his performance was partly inspired by Paul's absence. ""Everyone needs to step up because we don't have a choice,"" Capela said. ""Tonight, we did a great job, but we've got a lot of things to work on because Chris is going to be out for a little while so we're all going to have to step up."" DeMar DeRozan led San Antonio with 28 points and eight assists. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 18 points, and Rudy Gay added 13. DeRozan, a childhood friend of Harden's, said there's only one thing you can do defensively when Harden gets going. ""Hope he misses,"" he said. The Rockets scored 43 points in the third quarter and carried a 15-point lead in the final period. That followed one of their lowest-scoring first two periods of the season, including a 13-point second quarter. San Antonio led 43-41 at the break. In the third quarter, the Rockets made 9 of 13 3-pointers and finished the game with 19 3s on 54 attempts (35.2 percent). The Rockets were two games removed from setting an NBA record with 26 3s in a 136-118 win over Washington. Danuel House Jr. made his first start of the season for Houston. In 28 minutes, House had four points and three rebounds. Houston missed its first seven shots of the second quarter and went scoreless through the first five minutes of the period. The Rockets ended up with just 13 points in the second quarter, but trailed by just two points at halftime. The Rockets opened up the third quarter on a 12-0 run and took a 10-point lead. Houston had a season-high 43 points in the third quarter. That followed a 41-point first half. ""I mean, we made shots,"" D'Antoni said on Houston's third-quarter turnaround. ""I know it's a simple answer, but a lot of it is that, and then we cut off that energy. I thought our defense was good all the way from the first quarter on to give ourselves a chance."" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said Houston's rebounding made the difference. San Antonio fell to 1-8 when being outrebounded by an opponent on the road. The Spurs were outrebounded 58-43 and gave up a season-high 19 offensive rebounds ""Overall, the killer was the offensive boards,"" Popovich said. ""Capela was great. I didn't look at the stat sheet yet, but that was the killer."" The Rockets have won six of their last seven, while the Spurs lost for just the second time in their last nine games. ""We've gotten better, for sure,"" Aldridge said. ""We're playing a better brand of basketball, and I think we've learned how to play better with each other, and we'll get better, too."" TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio fell to 1-8 when being outrebounded by an opponent on the road. The Spurs were outrebounded 58-43 and gave up a season-high 19 offensive rebounds. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  On this night, Jonas Jerebko ignited the home crowd much the way Stephen Curry typically does when the two-time MVP throws his arms in the air begging for a little help and noise. And Draymond Green got back to his trash-talking best. Golden State needed a big contribution from the Swede, a couple of nice 3-pointers from Green and the chatter afterward, along with solid outings from the other reliable regulars. Kevin Durant had 29 points including a key 3-pointer with 15 seconds left, and added 12 rebounds and eight assists, and the Warriors held off a fourth-quarter rally and beat the Dallas Mavericks 120-116 on Saturday night. ""They made tough shots at the end. I don't want to get discouraged because of the last three minutes,"" Durant said. ""... I thought the whole basketball game we played pretty solid."" Durant and Andre Iguodala made consecutive 3s for the Warriors late in the third for a 94-87 lead entering the final 12 minutes, then the Warriors extended the lead to double digits before the Mavericks made a game of it in the closing minutes. Harrison Barnes' jumper with 1:20 remaining against his former team got Dallas within 117-115, then Durant missed a layup on the other end. ""This season we've done a good job of fighting and going up against adversity,"" Barnes said. ""Tonight was one of those things where they got into a rhythm, we got down a little bit there in the second half and we battled within a couple points."" Curry contributed 22 points, five rebounds and five assists and Jerebko provided a nice boost with a career-high 23 points on 10-for-12 shooting with six rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench. The made field goals also were his most this season, and Jerebko received a rousing ovation when he took a seat with 6:39 to play. ""This is a very accomplished team, so I'm just trying to fit in where I can and do whatever it takes,"" Jerebko said. Wesley Matthews scored 25 points on 9-for-15 shooting with seven 3-pointers as Dallas lost its fifth straight. Mavericks rookie sensation Luka Doncic made 5 of 11 shots with three 3-pointers in the first half for 14 of his 19 points, helping Dallas take a 61-58 lead at intermission. DeAndre Jordan matched his season high with 23 rebounds, getting 12 before the break. Green had 14 points for his fourth double-digit scoring performance this season to go with 10 rebounds and five assists in Golden State's 12th straight victory against the Mavericks at Oracle Arena. ""He's talked about it. It's no secret he wants to shoot the ball better,"" Curry said. ""It gives us a nice little energy boost when he just shoots with confidence, no matter if he makes or misses really."" Green, limited by injuries, vowed that his shots would start falling. He hit just his second and third 3-pointers since early November, then gestured at the Mavericks to guard him. Green had been 1 of 16 from deep since making two on Halloween. ""You practice your shots, you put your work in, you've got the right to shoot,"" he said. ""That's why I'll keep shooting."" Klay Thompson had 14 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block. The Mavericks beat the two-time defending champions 112-109 at Dallas on Nov. 17. Both teams played the first night of back-to-backs. BELOVED USHER LOST Georgia Wilton, an usher at Oracle Arena for 23 years, was honored during the second quarter with a tribute on the scoreboard from Warriors COO Rick Welts. Her photo was shown with the message ""In Loving Memory of Georgia Wilton."" Her daughters, June and Carol, were in attendance and shown on the screen.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Paul George hasn't stopped thinking about last season's playoff exit against the Utah Jazz. ""I've owed this to this team. I didn't like the way I finished in this arena last time I was here. That was on my mind,"" said George, who had 43 points and 14 rebounds to help the Oklahoma City Thunder hold off Utah 107-106 on Saturday night. The Thunder lost to the Jazz 4-2 in the first round of the 2018 NBA playoffs. George wasn't fully healthy and struggled at times, and that sour taste has stuck with him. ""This building. This building,"" he repeated, shaking his head. Jerami Grant and Steven Adams each scored 15 as the Thunder (21-10) won their fourth straight game and tied Denver for the best record in the Western Conference. Russell Westbrook had eight points on 3-for-17 shooting with 12 rebounds and nine assists. Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Jazz (16-18). Donovan Mitchell scored 20, Derrick Favors added 16 and Ricky Rubio had 12 points and 14 assists, his most since he's been in Utah. Three nights after scoring 43 points against Sacramento, George went 15 for 25 from the field and made five 3-pointers while dishing out six assists. ""He really got into an unbelievable rhythm and flow. What he did was remarkable out there,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. George hit a jumper to extend Oklahoma City's lead to 106-97, but the Jazz fought back on the strength of their defense. After a miss by Westbrook, Mitchell drove for a layup to make it 107-105. After Mitchell and Dennis Schroder exchanged steals, Westbrook fouled out trying to block Mitchell on a potential tying dunk with 1.5 seconds remaining. ""Russ saved the game,"" George said. Mitchell was slow to get up after hitting the floor hard, and his first free throw rimmed out. Mitchell launched the second free throw high, apparently attempting to generate a long rebound, but it swished through for the final margin. ""Just missed a free throw,"" Mitchell said. ""No way around it. That can't happen."" Westbrook was on the bench with four fouls when Rubio made a 3-pointer to give the Jazz a 79-70 lead midway through the third quarter. George scored 18 points in the last 6:04 of the period -- on everything from driving dunks to spinning 3s -- to forge a 93-81 advantage after three free throws with five seconds left. ""Russ went down and I knew I had to take over. I looked to be aggressive, attack and make plays,"" George said. In all, the Thunder outscored the Jazz 23-2 when everything went through George. He flexed while facing the Utah crowd on the baseline, he talked trash with Joe Ingles and he demanded the ball, even while drawing double-teams at times. George didn't do it just by shooting. In the fourth quarter, Mitchell looked as though he was headed for a breakaway dunk and George somehow took the ball from him. A couple of plays later, the Jazz overplayed him and he deftly dropped the ball off to Adams for an easy slam. ""He's putting the ball in the hole at an incredible rate,"" Donovan said. ""Everybody talks about the points, but he had 14 rebounds tonight and he gets those four, five, six seven assists and he gets a few steals. But it's the total impact he has on the game and he's been doing an incredible job."" George took some time getting in a rhythm after offseason knee surgery and the Thunder lost four straight. Since then, he has become nearly unstoppable. In his last nine games, George has averaged more than 32 points on 47 percent 3-point shooting. ""This is about the best he's played since he's been with us in Oklahoma City,"" Westbrook said. ""Once he gets it going, just make sure to find that hot hand."" DON'T WORRY ABOUT RUSS Even though Westbrook is mired in a shooting slump, his play is central to the Thunder's success. ""The guy gives his heart and soul to the game. He just cares about winning,"" Donovan said. ""His offense, I'm not worried about it. It will continue to come. ... I've got all the confidence in the world in him. If we want to be the team we hope to be, he's got to be a big part of it."" George agrees that Westbrook is so much more than a shooter. ""Offense doesn't determine a player of Russell's caliber. Who cares if he is struggling and shots aren't falling? He impacts the game is so many ways,"" George said. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook picked up his fourth foul trying to get around Gobert's pick with 7:33 left in the third, but the Thunder were actually outscored by 12 points when he was on the court. ... Despite allowing several offensive rebounds down the stretch, the Thunder outrebounded the Jazz 51-44. ... This is the first time George has had consecutive 40-plus point games. Jazz: Even with a number of open looks, Utah didn't make a 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. ... The Jazz hadn't lost at home when getting more than 30 assists since Nov. 26, 2008. Utah had 35 assists. ... Gobert tallied his 28th double-double of the season.","401071166"
"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons thought they had the right big guy on the line. With 23 seconds left and trailing the Atlanta Hawks by a point, it was Blake Griffin with two free throws instead of Andre Drummond, one of the worst free-throw shooters in league history. Griffin missed both shots, and the Hawks held on for a 98-95 victory Sunday. ""I have to be better than that,"" he said. ""We fought back to give ourselves a chance to win the game, and I missed the shots."" The Hawks led by as many as 17 before Detroit's late rally and won their third straight to improve to 9-23. Alex Len had 15 points and a season-high 17 rebounds, while Vince Carter scored a season-best 18. Atlanta was playing without leading scorer John Collins because of an ankle injury. ""We were missing John tonight, so we had a unique opportunity to start two centers in Dewayne (Dedmon) and Alex,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Alex embraced it and took advantage of it."" Facing Drummond, one of the best rebounders in the league, Len had eight offensive boards and held Drummond to two. ""Blake and Andre both had a lot of missed shots, and we were able to grab them and score on our own misses,"" Len said. ""I think our defense really kept us in the game."" Detroit has lost nine of 11. Langston Galloway led the Pistons with 18, and Drummond had 13 points and 15 rebounds. ""We talked before the game about having to have a good approach in a game like this, playing just before Christmas against a team with a bad record,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We had that attitude in the fourth quarter, but you can't win a game by playing one quarter."" After Griffin's misses, Jeremy Lin hit two foul shots to stretch the lead, Reggie Jackson dunked for the Pistons, and Lin hit two more free throws to make it 96-93. Galloway missed a layup, and the Hawks locked it up from the line. Carter had 14 points in the first half while Atlanta led by as many as 17. ""The OG, Vince Carter, put down the walker,"" Dedmon said. ""He dropped it and had a big game. So did Alex, because we needed people to step up and replace John."" A late 3-pointer by Griffin helped the Pistons to narrow the margin to 57-43 at the break. Atlanta outshot Detroit 51.3 percent to 43.9 percent and got 13 points off 11 turnovers. ""We're trying to get out of this slump, but we have to have more energy,"" Galloway said. ""We can't only play hard in the fourth."" The Pistons got within nine early in the third, but back-to-back tip-ins by Len kept the Hawks comfortably ahead. Galloway hit back-to-back 3-pointers to pull the Pistons within 83-75 with 8:55 to play. He was the only Piston to score in the first 6:16 of the quarter, but his 14 points narrowed the gap to 85-80. Zaza Pachulia's tip made it 88-85 with 3:17 left, and two free throws by Griffin got the Pistons within one. Carter answered with a fall-away basket, but Galloway scored over Len to make it 90-89. After misses on both ends, Lin's reverse layup put the Hawks up three with 1:22 to play. Jackson's free throws cut the lead to 92-91 and Pachulia stole the ball from Lin, but Griffin couldn't hit the ensuing shots from the line. TIP-INS Hawks: Len was only the ninth player to have eight or more offensive rebounds against the Pistons in the past five seasons. ... The Hawks had lost six of eight to Detroit but posted their first victory at Little Caesars Arena. Pistons: Detroit is third in the NBA in offensive rebounds, mostly thanks to Drummond, but only had five to Atlanta's 15 on Sunday. ... Luke Kennard started at small forward but sat out the second half with both knees wrapped in ice.","401071167"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Even well-rested opponents haven't had much chance against Myles Turner recently. The night after a marathon victory, the Washington Wizards didn't have the legs to keep up. Turner had 18 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, and the Indiana Pacers beat sluggish Washington 105-89 on Sunday. The Wizards were coming off a triple-overtime win over Phoenix in Washington the previous night. They shot a season-low 36.8 percent. ""We knew they were fatigued, but it's an NBA team, so they're going to go out there and give us their best shot,"" Turner said. Turner has a double-double in four straight games after never stringing together more than two straight in his career. ""He's been playing well on both ends of the floor,"" guard Victor Oladipo said. ""Defensively, he's been amazing for us."" Turner said he is being more aggressive on his rebounding. ""Just going to go get the ball as opposed to just kind of waiting for it to come to me,"" he said. ""I think that's the big difference."" The Pacers had seven players in double-figure scoring. Domantas Sabonis came off the bench to contribute 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Bojan Bogdanovic scored 13 of his 14 points in the first half. Markieff Morris led the Wizards with 16 points off the bench. Thomas Bryant added 11 points, hitting 3 of 6 shots a night after making all 14 attempts. Bryant said fatigue was a pretty big factor. ""We had some open looks at the beginning of the second half that just didn't fall for us and a little fatigue set it,"" he said. ""But I felt we pushed through."" Turner was 3-of-10 shooting in the first half, but finished 8 of 17. ""In the second half, he starting knocking down shots and rotating the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""That's the read he and (Sabonis) have to make."" Indiana stretched its seven-point halftime lead to 84-64 in the third quarter. The Wizards were 8-of-30 shooting in the period. ""Our defense towards the end of the third quarter, we locked down and we got three or four stops in a row,"" Turner said. The Wizards had 13 first-half turnovers, eight more than the Pacers. The Wizards finished with 22 turnovers while the Pacers had 17, including nine in fourth quarter. ""We are still turning the ball over too many times,"" McMillan said. ""We just got careless in the fourth quarter. You have to play the game for 48 minutes."" Turnovers frustrated Wizards coach Scott Brooks as well. ""When you play against a good team, you have to take care of the ball, especially on the road,"" Brooks said. ""They scored 25 points off of our turnovers. We haven't played well on the road."" TIP-INS Wizards: John Wall played after missing Saturday night's game against Phoenix with flu-like symptoms. Wall had seven points on 1-of-7 shooting ... Washington has lost seven of nine to fall to 13-21. ...

"BOSTON --  A little internal venting seemed to get the Boston Celtics back on track. Kyrie Irving scored 25 points, Jayson Tatum had 17 and the Celtics ended a three-game skid with a 119-103 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night. Boston was coming off a 120-107 loss at home to Milwaukee on Friday, which prompted a closed-door meeting in the locker room. The Celtics came out Sunday looking much more like the team that had won eight straight before the skid. ""The team meeting was good,"" said Marcus Morris, who had 12 points and eight rebounds for the Celtics. ""We talked about a few things. Guys understood where other guys were coming from. We just opened up to each other, and I think it was beneficial."" In addition to clearing the air, the Celtics had Al Horford back in the lineup after he missed seven games with a sore left knee. Horford finished with 10 points and six rebounds. Irving said Horford's return certainly helped on the court and in the locker room with another veteran voice helping smooth over the recent tensions. ""We have so much depth,"" Irving said. ""Getting past those things, just egocentric things, this is a chance of a lifetime for us. In order to achieve what we want to, we have to be closer as a team."" The Celtics responded Sunday by scoring the first nine points and never trailed. Boston shot 50 percent and outrebounded the Hornets 47-37. ""They just wanted it more. They came out hungrier,"" said Kemba Walker, who led Charlotte with 21 points. ""They came out on a mission, and they accomplished it."" After a tight first quarter, the Celtics blew it open in the second, starting with eight straight points during a 14-1 run. Boston made 23 of 44 shots in the second quarter and took a 68-47 lead into halftime. The third quarter was more of the same, with Boston opening on a 12-4 run and taking an 80-53 lead when Irving drove for a layup while drawing a foul with 6:57 left in the period. The reserves took over in the fourth quarter and all but one Boston player finished with at least three points. Brad Wanamaker was the only member of the Celtics without a point, missing his only two shots in 7:10 of the fourth quarter. STARTING LINES After pacing the Hornets through a tight first quarter with 14 points, Walker scored only seven the rest of the way. Jeremy Lamb was the only other starter for Charlotte to score in double figures with 14 points -- tying the combined total for the Hornets' three other starters. Boston's starters outscored Charlotte's 70-49. ""I think in our overall mentality just wasn't there tonight,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""They were just the more aggressive team. They just looked like the more hungry team tonight."" BIG AL Horford said his knee felt good after playing 19 minutes Sunday, making all four of his shots and adding five assists. Coach Brad Stevens said Horford's minutes were capped at 20, which was not an issue as he and the rest of Boston's starters rested the entire fourth quarter. ""I'm just happy that I was able to go out there and play with a lot of energy. It's just good to be back. Sitting on the sidelines is tough, not being able to be on the court and help the guys,"" said Horford, who made his 900th career block in the third quarter.

"NEW YORK --  Deandre Ayton was eating breakfast after a short, sleepless night when the reality of NBA life hit the rookie. In college, he'd have had a break Sunday. This is the pros. ""I was talking to the coach, I was like, `Yo, we've got to do this again,"" he said. He and the Suns found out just how tough that is with weary legs after playing three overtimes a night earlier. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 24 points, D'Angelo Russell had 18 points, eight assists and six rebounds, and the Brooklyn Nets beat the Suns 111-103 on Sunday night. The Suns, who fell 149-146 in Washington a night earlier, dropped their second straight after a four-game winning streak. Rookie Rodions Kurucs from Latvia added 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets. They bounced back from a loss to Indiana on Friday to win for the eighth time in nine games. ""I still think the defense could be better. I think we're in an OK place, not a great place,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. Ayton had 26 points and 18 rebounds, shooting 13 of 16 from the field. Devin Booker -- who yawned a couple times in the locker room before the game -- had 25 points and nine assists a night after playing 55 minutes. The Suns arrived at their New York hotel after 1:30 a.m. and had a short turnaround with the game in Brooklyn tipping at the earlier-than-usual time of 6 p.m., and knew they faced a tough game. ""It's the NBA. We understand that,"" Booker said. ""I'd say a late game going into an early game I don't quite understand. I think the other way around would make more sense, but I don't make the schedule. They say computers do, so we'll just go with that."" They had a brunch meeting Sunday but coach Igor Kokoskov said they didn't talk much basketball, feeling the players weren't ready to think about that. He said even the players who said they were tired and sore wanted to play. They were a step slow in the first quarter, giving up 38 points, but steadied themselves in the second and trailed 63-56 at halftime. It wasn't close much longer, thanks to Brooklyn making five 3-pointers in the third quarter while Phoenix went 0 for 5. Ayton's basket had cut it to two with 8:26 left in the period before Joe Harris and Russell made consecutive 3-pointers, Kurucs made the next two baskets and Jared Dudley made another 3 to cap a 13-0 spurt and give the Nets a 79-64 lead. Russell hit another 3 for the final points of the period, making it 91-74. ""Man, we started making winning plays,"" Russell said. ""To get separation we had to get stops. It took a lot.""

""The referees, and I really mean this, I think they do a fantastic job and that's throughout the league,"" Atkinson said.

"CLEVELAND --  Lauri Markkanen put up big numbers again, but wasn't interested in his statistics. Chicago's rising star had something more important on his mind. ""We knew we haven't had a winning streak yet, so we wanted to break that,"" he said. Markkanen scored 31 points and the Bulls won consecutive games for the first time this season, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 112-92 on Sunday night. Markkanen followed up on his a season-high 32 points Friday night in a victory over Orlando. ""I don't know why you want to talk to me again tonight,"" he said. ""I say the same thing every game. I'm just trying to stay aggressive."" Markkanen had 14 points in the third quarter, including a four-point play late in the period that sparked an 18-5 run in the game between the teams that began the game tied for last in the Eastern Conference. The 6-foot-10 forward from Finland hit a 3-pointer from the left wing and made the free throw after being fouled by David Nwaba. Justin Holiday had a 3-pointer on the next possession, extending the lead to 84-72. Cavaliers coach Larry Drew told his players following the game he was disappointed they didn't play with more energy, particularly when Chicago took control after Cleveland led 67-66 midway through the third period. ""It just seems when we hit a bump in the road things get really rocky real fast,"" he said. ""It's something we have to learn how to play through."" The Bulls shot 64 percent in the second half, leaving forward Larry Nance Jr. to point out that the Cavaliers are one of the worst defensive teams in the league. ""It's heart,"" he said. ""It's will. We're letting guys have career nights on us. That's something we have to take personally. We've got to man up."" Kris Dunn added 17 points, and Holiday had 15 for Chicago. Nance led Cleveland with 20 points, and Cedi Osman and Jordan Clarkson each had 17. Rookie point guard Collin Sexton was 3 of 16 from the field and scored six points. Cleveland has lost five of six. Nwaba sprained his left ankle when he fell awkwardly in the fourth quarter. He was down for several moments and was helped to the locker room by his teammates. Markkanen made 11 of 18 shots and had five 3-pointers. He hit two 3-pointers and had 10 points in the first five minutes of the third quarter. The Bulls are 4-6 under Jim Boylen. He took over when Fred Hoiberg was fired Dec. 3. ""We're thankful for the win,"" Boylen said. ""I'm proud of them. We're in this together. You have to credit the guys for being coachable and teachable, and they're becoming reliable. It's fun."" STILL ON THE BENCH Jabari Parker, who was taken out of the Bulls' regular rotation last week, didn't play for the fifth straight game. Boylen said the 6-foot-8 forward was available after dealing with a stomach illness that caused him to miss two games. ""He needs to lock into practicing hard, playing hard and honoring the values of the team, which I have set forth for the team,"" Boylen said. ""Every day is an opportunity to do that. Every guy has to do that, just not him."" Parker is averaging 15.2 points and 6.9 rebounds in 29 games. ANOTHER INJURY Cleveland guard Rodney Hood, who averages 12.9 points, missed the game with a sore left Achilles. Drew doesn't know how long Hood will be sidelined. Kevin Love (left foot surgey) and Tristan Thompson (sprained left foot)  could return in January. TIP-INS Bulls: Holiday hit a 3-pointer less than two minutes into the game. His franchise-record of making a 3-pointer in 43 straight games ended Friday. ... G Cameron Payne (strained right calf) missed his second straight game. ... Boylen said G Zack LaVine, who missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left ankle is showing improvement every day and could return soon. Cavaliers: Sexton was knocked to the floor driving to the basket in the second quarter, but remained in the game ... Drew has taken to calling an early timeout when his team shows a lack of effort on the defensive end. Chicago scored on its first four possessions, and Drew called time with 10:06 remaining in the first quarter.","401071171"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It was a 500 kind of night for the Miami Heat, who got their record back to .500 and delivered coach Erik Spoelstra his 500th coaching victory. Tyler Johnson scored 20 of his 25 points in the third quarter as Miami defeated the Orlando Magic 115-91 and ran its winning streak to five games. Justise Winslow added 22 points and Josh Richardson finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which beat Orlando for the first time in three tries this season and improved to 16-16. Dwayne Wade, playing his 24th and likely final game in Orlando, had 10 points and four assists in 24 minutes. ""I definitely think having four wins in a row, this was the best team for us to play because they've had our number this year,"" Wade said. ""It made us focus on what we need to do to not lose to them three times in a row."" Johnson made just his fourth start of the season and hit five 3-pointers in the third quarter, finishing off one with a four-point play. ""Usually for me, if I hit one or two, it's going up again,"" said Johnson, whose season-high scoring output came without playing in the fourth quarter. ""When guys have been able to get going during this little run that we've had, we go back to him. I think that puts a little confidence in players because they know once they get going, the ball will find them. And it opens up everything else for the offense."" Spoelstra, Miami's coach since the 2008-09 season, has a career coaching record of 500-336 and has won two NBA titles. The milestone win, he said, humbled him. ""But it doesn't even register as real to me right now, and that's why I'm so grateful for the opportunity,"" Spoelstra said. ""There's been a lot of low points and a lot of incredible moments, but you don't get to survive those low points if you don't have the belief of the people above you."" Evan Fournier scored 17 points for the Magic, who lost their third straight. ""Obviously we've lost our way here a little bit, which actually happens a lot during an NBA season,"" said coach Steve Clifford. ""(The Heat) are rolling, they played great, they shot the ball well."" The Heat came into the game with the NBA's worst field goal percentage (.429), but shot 43 for 84 (.506). Richardson hit a 3-pointer and converted a three-point play that gave Miami a 37-18 lead early in the second quarter. The Heat were in control until going 4:35 without a field goal. Jonathan Isaac's two free throws with 3:29 left in the first half punctuated a 16-2 run that cut Orlando's deficit to five points. The Heat led 53-44 at halftime, and Johnson's shooting helped them build that advantage to 26 points in the third quarter. Orlando cut it to eight in the fourth quarter, but four straight free throws by Richardson opened an 11-0 run by Miami that put the game away. OH THAT 500! Asked before the game about the possibility of reaching 500, Spoelsta assumed the question was about his team's record, which was 15-16 at the time. When informed he was one win away from his 500th career victory, the 48-year-old Spoelstra replied: ""I'm getting old, I guess."" TIP-INS Heat: F Rodney McGruder, the only player to have started Miami's first 31 games, was a last-minute scratch due to a stomach ailment. Tyler Johnson took his spot in the starting lineup. ... Miami held a sixth straight opponent under 100 points. ... The Heat lead the Florida series 65-53. Magic: F Jonathon Simmons played 20 minutes after missing Friday's game at Chicago with a sprained right ankle. ... The Magic are 2-6 since winning in Miami on Dec. 4.","401071172"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Dave Joerger is pretty proud of the way his Kings have been able to generate a few big comeback wins this season. It's the early double-digit deficits the Sacramento coach could do without. Willie Cauley-Stein had 22 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, Buddy Hield scored 28 and the Kings overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the reeling New Orleans Pelicans 122-117 on Sunday. ""The identity that we're never out of a game, we love,"" Joerger said. ""The identity of starting slow because we're going to catch you later is not what I'm looking for. We've got some young bodies, some young minds, and the best is in front of us. But there's some tired guys in there."" Sacramento fell behind by 19 in the first half Friday before rallying to beat the Memphis Grizzlies. By doing the same thing against New Orleans, the Kings became the first team since the 2010 Indiana Pacers to trail by 19 and win in consecutive games. ""We've just been fortunate to get stops late,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""We don't want to have to battle down 20. We just have to get stops earlier. In the first half of the last couple of games, they get a lot of layups."" Bogdan Bogdanovic added 24 points, De'Aaron Fox had 19 points and 11 assists, and Iman Shumpert scored 10. Anthony Davis had 26 points and 17 rebounds for the Pelicans. Jrue Holiday added 27 points, six assists and seven rebounds. New Orleans has lost four straight and 12 of 17. ""It's kind of the same story for us,"" Holiday said. ""Between the coaches and the players, we have to get on the same page when it comes down to the last four minutes. In the second half they started making shots."" Down 105-94 with 7 1/2 minutes left, the Kings scored 14 consecutive points as part of a 19-5 run to take control. Hield fueled the comeback with a pair of 3-pointers and a fast-break layup, and Fox made a free throw to put the Kings up 113-110 with 2:03 remaining. Sacramento pushed its lead to 121-114 before Davis made a 3. After Fox made one of two free throws, Julius Randle scored and appeared to get fouled but the play was overturned on replay. The Pelicans, who scored a franchise-record 149 points against the Kings when the teams met in the second game of the season in October, got off to another fast start. New Orleans led 32-13 in the first quarter, then withstood a surge by Sacramento in the second to go up 69-58 at halftime. ""We played well over stretches and then we go away from what we're doing,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We stopped moving the basketball and tried to do it ourselves. We're not capable of doing that."" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans scored 66 points in the paint. ... Davis had eight points in the first quarter, going 6 for 6 on free throws. ... Nikola Mirotic missed his fifth consecutive game because of a sore right ankle. Kings: Marvin Bagley (bruised left knee) sat out his fifth straight game. ... The Kings made five 3s in the fourth quarter. FOX-LIKE REFLEXES Fox made a phenomenal defensive play in the second quarter when he chased down Tim Frazier and blocked a fast-break layup attempt from behind. The ball ricocheted off the backboard and nearly went to midcourt, leading to an easy basket for Hield as the Golden1 Center crowd erupted in a thunderous ovation. NEW YEAR, NEW KINGS With two games left in 2018, the Kings (18-15) are guaranteed of heading into the new year with a winning record for the first time since 2004-05. ""It's fantastic,"" Joerger said. ""Guys have put in a lot of work. It's also a feather in the hat of our organization and the direction that we're going.""","401071173"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The struggling Minnesota Timberwolves pulled off perhaps their best win of the season Sunday night. Andrew Wiggins scored a season-high 30 points and hit the go-ahead layup with 14 seconds remaining to help the Timberwolves defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 114-112. It was Minnesota's first road win against a Western Conference team this season, and it came against a squad that entered the night tied for the best record in the West. ""It's very important,"" Wiggins said. ""We have been very solid at home this year, but on the road is what's killing us. Hopefully, this will keep us going and we can build on it and continue to rise and get better."" Wiggins made 11 of 20 shots and had six rebounds and five assists. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 18 points and Robert Covington added 13 for the Timberwolves, who shot 49 percent from the field and made 14 of 27 3-pointers against one of the league's top defensive teams. ""Wig (Wiggins) had a monster game for us, and then we had a number of guys step up and make real timely plays,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. Oklahoma City's Paul George had 31 points and 11 rebounds, but he missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer that would have won it. Russell Westbrook had 23 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for the Thunder, his ninth of the season and the 113th of his career, who had won four straight, including a victory at Utah on Saturday night. With the Thunder down 113-112 after Wiggins' late layup, Westbrook attacked the rim and found Alex Abrines for an open corner 3-pointer. Abrines missed, and Wiggins got the rebound. ""I shot three layups in a row,"" Westbrook said. ""They collapsed. Alex was wide open. I made the right play. Whoever it is I always make the right play no matter the results."" Wiggins made one of two free throws with 7.3 seconds left before George's final miss. The Timberwolves led for most of the first half, but the Thunder rallied and took a 63-53 lead into the break. George, who sat out part of the first quarter with two fouls, scored 15 points in the second. Minnesota outscored Oklahoma City 33-17 in the third quarter to take an 86-80 advantage into the fourth. The Timberwolves pushed the lead up to 10 as Westbrook returned to action with about eight minutes remaining. George hit a jumper to tie it at 104 with just under three minutes left in regulation to set up the finish. TIP-INS Timberwolves: G Derrick Rose sat out with a sore left ankle. He left Friday's game against San Antonio in the second quarter and did not return. ... Wiggins scored 15 points in the first quarter. ... F Dario Saric was called for a technical foul in the second quarter. Thunder: C Steven Adams fell to the ground after getting hit with an inadvertent knee to the groin area by Towns in the second quarter. The play was reviewed, but nothing was called on Towns. ... Starting G Terrance Ferguson left the game in the first half due to illness and did not return. ... Westbrook fouled out with 7.3 seconds to play. It was only his second time fouling out this season. M-V-P! George got M-V-P chants during the game, something normally reserved for Westbrook. He had scored 43 points in each of his previous two games. He has scored at least 30 points in seven of his 11 games. HE SAID IT Thibodeau on getting the win against the Thunder: ""They are a very tough team. Their record tells you how good they are. To win on the road you have to bring toughness. You have to get stops. We've still got a lot of work to do defensively, but I thought offensively, our guys were terrific.""","401071174"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  On a night the Los Angeles Clippers set records with their 3-point shooting, Steph Curry won the game for Golden State at the rim. Curry made a layup with 0.5 seconds left and the Warriors outlasted the Clippers 129-127 in an emotionally charged game Sunday night. Curry had 42 points to tie his second-highest scoring output of the season. He also got the last laugh after he exchanged heated words with Clippers guard Patrick Beverley in the first quarter, a sequence that earned both players a technical foul. The Clippers' Avery Bradley tied it at 127 with a dunk with 20.6 seconds remaining. On the next possession, Curry had Montrezl Harrell on him at the top of the key, drove down the middle of the lane and converted the layup off the glass for the winner. Tobias Harris missed a shot as time expired, giving the Warriors their eighth victory in 10 games. Kevin Durant added 35 points for Golden State to help offset the Clippers' 78-percent (18 of 23) 3-point shooting. ""That's just who they are,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said about Curry and Durant. ""They're aggressive, they're talented, and they both had just incredible moments during that game where they each took over."" Harris led Los Angeles with 32 points, and Lou Williams added 25. The Clippers' shot 81.2 percent from 3-point range in the first half (13 for 16), setting an NBA record for highest 3-point percentage in a half (minimum 13 made). Those 13 first-half 3s also set a franchise record for most in a half. ""We don't really take moral victories,"" Beverley said. ""We could have, and we should have, won today, but we came up short."" As for his flare-up with Curry, Beverley said: ""We're a tough team, they're a tough team, too. ... It's basketball. It's going to stay basketball."" Durant had 14 points in the third quarter and Curry added 11 as the Warriors outscored the Clippers 36-23 to take a 103-94 lead into the fourth. Harris was 5 for 5 from long distance in the first half and had 19 points as Los Angeles led 71-67 at the break. Curry had 22 points in the half, but Golden State was 5 of 16 from 3-point range. However, they outscored Los Angeles 24-10 from the free throw line in the first two quarters and that kept it close. INJURY UPDATE Durant landed awkwardly and rolled his left ankle in the first quarter. He got up gingerly but stayed in the game and played with a wrap on his ankle. ""I don't think it's anything serious, but we'll see how he holds up when he comes in tomorrow,"" Kerr said. SPECIAL BOBBLEHEAD The Warriors had a little fun with Curry, decorating a bobblehead box to make it astronaut-themed and leaving it at the two-time MVP's locker Sunday, in light of Curry's recent comments about not believing there was ever a U.S. moon landing. Curry held a lengthy Skype chat last weekend with astronaut Scott Kelly to tell Kelly and others he meant no harm with the joke about not believing in the moon landing. TIP-INS Clippers: The Clippers have lost 14 of the past 16 regular-season meetings against Golden State. ... Los Angeles won 125-106 last Jan. 10 at Oracle Arena to snap an 11-game losing streak on the Warriors' home floor. Warriors: Durant has scored 30 or more points in four of the last six games. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Dallas rookie sensation Luka Doncic to send the game into overtime could have rattled the Portland Trail Blazers. Instead, they made the most of the additional five minutes. ""I mean, people make shots. It's the NBA,"" Jusuf Nurkic said about Doncic's big 3. ""You can't get down (because of) one shot."" Portland recovered in overtime to hand the Mavericks their sixth straight loss, 121-118 on Sunday night. Damian Lillard had 33 points and Nurkic added 10 points and 12 rebounds for his 16th double-double this season to help the Blazers win for the fourth time in five games. Harrison Barnes led the slumping Mavericks with 27 points. Doncic had 23 points and 11 rebounds, including a corner 3 at the buzzer that tied it at 107. Maurice Harkless' layup gave Portland a 114-109 lead with 2:43 to go in the extra period. DeAndre Jordan's dunk pulled the Mavs to 116-115 with under a minute left, but Lillard's layup kept Portland in front with 34.2 seconds to go and the Blazers held on despite a flurry of 3-point attempts by Dallas. ""It was a wild finish,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Doncic hit an outstanding shot. We didn't defend it well, but it was an amazing shot. I'm glad the way we regrouped and kind of maintained the lead throughout overtime."" Portland led by 14 in the third quarter but the Mavericks closed the gap in the fourth. Barnes and Wesley Matthews made consecutive 3s to bring Dallas to 100-98 with 3:56 left. Matthews, a former Blazer, added another 3 to put Dallas up 101-100. After Doncic's free throw, Harkless hit a 3-pointer to put Portland back in front 103-102 with 1:42 to go. The teams traded baskets before Lillard's layup made it a three-point game. As time expired, Doncic connected over Harkless' outstretched arms. ""The guy has an uncanny knack for making shots like that,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I can't say I was surprised when it went in. I've seen him do things like that too many times."" Doncic sounded kind of surprised, though: ""I mean, it just went in. It was a tough shot,"" he said. It was the fourth game of a road trip and the second half of a back-to-back for Dallas. The Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors 120-116 on Saturday night. Doncic, the NBA's leading rookie scorer, was questionable with a right hip injury but he started. He had an immediate impact with seven early points, including a tip that gave the Mavericks a 17-12 lead midway through the first quarter. Evan Turner's basket tied it at 23 as the quarter came to a close. The Blazers went on a 16-2 run to pull in front 58-47 and led 62-52 at halftime. Portland scored 37 points in the second quarter. ""A loss is a loss but these ones are tough because we battled so much. We just came up short,"" Barnes said. ""We've got to find a way to pull it through."" The Mavs played without Dennis Smith Jr., who has a strained right wrist. They also were without Dirk Nowitzki, limited after returning from left ankle surgery that kept him out of the team's first 26 games. Nowitzki, who has appeared in five games, played 13 minutes against the Warriors and scored three points. The Blazers were coming of a 120-90 loss on Friday night to Utah, their worst defeat at home in nearly 14 years. It snapped a three-game winning streak. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas beat the Blazers 111-102 at home on Dec. 4. This was the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Trail Blazers: With a 3-pointer in the first half, CJ McCollum moved past Damon Stoudamire (717) into fifth on the Blazers' career list for 3s. ... Portland's second-quarter points (37) were the most the team had scored in the period this season. UP THE CHARTS Stotts got his 291st win with the Blazers, tying Rick Adelman for second on the franchise list. Jack Ramsay won 453 games as Portland's coach.","401071176"

"DETROIT --  There's no trophy for beating a slumping team like the Washington Wizards in late December. For Blake Griffin and the Detroit Pistons, though, Wednesday night's victory felt like a big deal. After losing nine of 11, the Pistons went on a 23-2 run to start the second half and held on to beat Washington 106-95. ""That game was pretty close to a must win, just for the sake of our morale and righting the ship,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We came out with focus and energy in the third quarter, and that meant we weren't fighting from behind down the stretch."" The Pistons didn't make it easy on themselves, turning the ball over 24 times for 26 Washington points. The Wizards trailed by 22 but got as close as three in the fourth quarter, including one possession where Trevor Ariza missed a tying 3-point attempt. ""I think we turned the ball over 12 times in the fourth quarter, and that's obviously not acceptable,"" Casey said. ""Luckily, we had enough of a cushion to survive taking our foot off the gas pedal, but we'll be using those as teaching moments."" Griffin had 23 points and nine rebounds, and Andre Drummond got his 10th straight double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. ""When you turn the ball over 24 times, you know you can do a much better job,"" Griffin said. ""They are aggressive in the passing lanes, but there are also things we can control better than we have."" Two lesser-known Pistons played key roles. Casey took Luke Kennard out of the lineup and replaced him with defensive-specialist Bruce Brown, using the rookie against both Bradley Beal and John Wall. Langston Galloway stayed in his usual role providing offense off the bench, while Kennard didn't play. Galloway finished with 22 points on 8-of-12 shooting, including four 3-pointers. The Wizards lost for the eighth time in 10 games and are 4-16 on the road. Wall had 21 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and Beal scored 21 points. ""We just had four really bad minutes of basketball,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""When you are struggling on the road, you have to play all 48 minutes."" The Pistons struggled early on the defensive end, allowing Washington to shoot 57.9 percent in the first half. They stayed in the game from the 3-point line. Detroit came into the game ranked 28th in 3-point percentage but hit 12 of its first 23 attempts. The last four came in the third quarter at the same time the Wizards were missing seven of their first eight shots in the second half. That allowed Detroit to take a 77-57 lead, but Washington began to force turnovers. Washington narrowed the gap to 85-72 at quarter's end and was within nine with 8:56 to play, aided by the Pistons missing 11 of their next 12 3-point attempts. Ariza hit a 3-pointer to make it 94-91 with 5:33 to play but missed another on the next possession. He was 5 for 8 from deep in the second half after not scoring a point in the first two quarters. Drummond, the second-worst free-throw shooter in NBA history, hit two with 2:32 left to give the Pistons a 100-93 advantage. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington came into the game averaging 113.2 points a game and were on pace to match that until their 17-point third quarter. ... Wall and Ian Mahinmi, along with Drummond, picked up technical fouls for ""hostile acts"" in the third quarter. Markieff Morris got one for arguing a call in the first half. Pistons: Drummond's double-double streak is the longest active run in the league. ... Detroit leads the league in opponent 3-point percentage and held Washington to 27.3 percent.","401071178"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Winning is something new for the Phoenix Suns. Devin Booker has been the reason. Booker, a third-year guard, had 35 points, eight assists and seven rebounds as Phoenix defeated the Orlando Magic 122-120 in overtime Wednesday night. Booker was the spark as Phoenix won for the fifth time in seven games. T.J. Warren added 24 points, including all four Phoenix points in overtime. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored had 19 points and Josh Jackson added 10 for Phoenix. ""Some teams just click sometimes,"" Booker said of the Suns' recent success. ""I remember last year Miami did that and ran off 15 straight or something like that. You never know when a team can click, an adjustment starts working or a new player is added like Kelly (Oubre) and it just clicks."" Booker shined in the final minute of regulation when he scored nine straight points, including a 3-pointer to tie game, two driving layups to put Phoenix in front and two free throws with 4.6 seconds left that gave the Suns a 118-115 lead with 4.6 seconds left in regulation. ""That's Devin's job description, that's what he does for us,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""He is the present and future of our organization. Whatever he decides to do with this program, that's what is going to happen."" The Suns, who have the worst record in the NBA despite their recent success, showed things will never be easy this season. They couldn't protect the three-point lead in the final seconds of regulation because forward Mikal Bridges fouled Magic point guard D.J. Augustin on a corner 3-point attempt with six-tenths of a second left on the clock. Augustin calmly drained all three free throws to send the game to overtime. ""We need a defense that gets stops to win a game because we're playing great teams,"" Kokoskov said. ""Our defense has got to be better and so does our understanding of defense."" Augustin led the Magic with a season-high 27 points and six assists.  Nikola Vucevic had 22 points and 13 rebounds and Terrence Ross scored 18 points off the bench.  Evan Fournier finished with 16 points, but missed a contested 3-pointer as time expired in overtime. It was the fourth straight loss for the Magic, who had several opportunities to seize control the game, but could never sustain good play beyond a 5-6 minute stretch.  They led by 12 early in the game, couldn't hold a nine-point lead late in the third quarter and couldn't finish in the fourth quarter, despite staying a basket in front of Phoenix until the final minute of regulation. In the overtime, Vucevic scored with 4:26 to play, but that was Orlando's only points in the extra period. The Magic were 1 for 10 from the field, including 0 for 5 on 3-pointers. They didn't shoot a free throw in overtime. ""We've proven to me that we're good enough to beat anybody on a given night, but we have to understand that we don't have a group that is going to show up and beat anybody just by outscoring or out-talenting them,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Tonight, the offense was much better, but the defense wasn't good enough."" Regulation was marked by a series of long runs by each team that didn't end until the middle of the fourth quarter, when Booker hit a baseline jumper that tied the game at 100-all. TIP-INS Suns: Deandre Ayton is the first rookie since Blake Griffin (2010) to have three straight games with 20-plus points and 15-plus rebounds. He had 10 rebounds and eight points against Orlando. . Devin Booker is averaging 30.6 points and 8.0 assists in his last six games. Magic: The 27 points was a season-high for D.J.

It was an off night for the Pacers' defense, which entered with the NBA's best scoring average. The Hawks, who have the league's second-worst offense, stayed close by hitting 17 3-pointers. Cory Joseph's 3 and fast-break layup ended a 19-10 run that gave the Pacers an 87-85 lead in the third quarter. Indiana never trailed after Myles Turner hit a 3 to make it 90-88 in the final minute of the period, and Young's 3 pushed the lead to seven with a second to go. The Pacers took charge in the fourth. Joseph fed Sabonis for an inside basket, Evans drove the lane on a fast break to feed Young, and Sabonis converted a three-point play to extend the margin to 102-93 with 9:03 remaining. Joseph followed with a 3 that gave Indiana its first double-digit advantage. Evans deked rookie Kevin Huerter on the perimeter and drove the lane for a layup that made it an eight-point lead. Evans' 3 put the Pacers up 11 with 3:37 to go. ""It's very important because you have guys attacking from everywhere, and the other team doesn't know how to stop it,"" said Oladipo, who leads the team in scoring and finished with 16 points. Young and Sabonis each scored inside in the final two minutes to hold Atlanta back when it pulled within five. Young has been producing at a high clip recently, averaging 18.8 points and nearly 10 rebounds in his previous four games. Darren Collison finished with 11 points and eight assists for Indiana, which improved to 23-12. Trae Young had 17 points and nine assists for Atlanta, which dropped to 9-24. ""It's a good measuring stick for us,"" Bazemore said. ""We came up a little short, just the small things that get you over the hump. We're learning. We're growing."" TIP-INS Pacers: It was Indiana's fourth victory in its last 21 games at Atlanta. ... Evans missed the previous two games with a right knee bruise. ... Sabonis finished two rebounds shy of his 16th double-double. He already has matched his total from last season. ... Sabonis was averaging 9.6 rebounds, tops among players who have started fewer than half their games. He has made one start in 33 games. Hawks: Collins returned to the lineup after missing the past two games with a left ankle sprain. He turned the same ankle during the preseason and missed the first 15 games. He has a double-double in nine of his last 10 games. ... Bazemore took a career-high 25 shots from the field. ... Atlanta leads the league in turnovers and committed 20, leading to 24 points for Indiana. ...  Dedmon started in place of Alex Len, sidelined by a sore back. ... F Omari Spellman had five points in seven minutes after missing eight games with right hip soreness.","401071180"
"NEW YORK --  Kemba Walker had the Nets down and almost out, and they turned to a gimmick defense to force the ball out of his hands. Somebody else on the Charlotte Hornets was going to have to make the winning play, and Malik Monk tried. It turned into the winning play for the Nets. Joe Harris gathered the ball near midcourt after Monk lost his dribble and drove in for the tiebreaking layup with 3.4 seconds left in the second overtime, giving Brooklyn a 134-132 victory on Wednesday night. Harris finished with season-high 27 points, while Spencer Dinwiddie had 37 points and 11 assists off the bench for the Nets, who won for the ninth time in 10 games. ""Just a total team win,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Sure Spencer, Spencer hit some amazing shots, but there were a lot of big plays from the whole group and that's kind of how we're built, that's how we're going to keep going forward."" The teams offset some big shots with mind-boggling miscues over the final stretches of regulation and the overtimes, and Monk made the biggest when he lost his dribble while the Hornets were trying to get a shot. He got another crack at it after Harris' basket when a clock malfunction necessitated time being put back on the clock, but he was well off on a last attempt. ""We should've been able to close the game out. Made a bunch of mistakes at the beginning to even get to the second overtime,"" Monk said. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds, and rookie Rodions Kurucs had 13 points and 12 boards. And they all contributed on a defense that wasn't part of the game plan. ""It's something we didn't really talk about but it was effective for us and froze them a little bit and allowed us to get just enough stops to be able to win,"" Dinwiddie said. Walker scored 35 points and engineered a personal 12-2 run that had the Hornets ahead by eight with just over 3 minutes remaining in regulation. But the Nets turned to a zone defense and whatever else they could do to force the ball out of his hands as much as possible late in the game. ""I don't know of anyone else in this league that's being guarded the way they guarded me. It was like a box-in-1. I haven't seen that since I was in college,"" Walker said. ""It was pretty crazy but I guess that's what teams are going to do, so I've just got to keep trusting in my teammates to make plays."" Jeremy Lamb added 31 points in the opener of a home-and-home series. Dinwiddie opened the second OT with a four-point play and the Nets went up by six after a basket by Harris. Monk made a 3-pointer and Walker converted a three-point play to tie it, and it went to the final seconds tied after baskets by Dinwiddie and Marvin Williams. After Walker's fourth-quarter flurry, Harris tied it first at 107 and then 110 with 3-pointers. Williams made a 3 before the Nets tied it again when Lamb fouled Dinwiddie on a 3-pointer with 6.5 seconds to play. Walker was fouled while dribbling and made one, but then he fouled DeMarre Carroll more than 70 feet from the basket as he rushed up the floor. Carroll made the first and missed the second, but the Hornets were called for a lane violation, giving him another attempt. He missed that as well and the game went to OT, where neither team led by more than two. TIP-INS Hornets: Walker had his 10th 30-point game of the season. ... Lamb was 5 for 5 for 12 points in the first quarter, helping Charlotte to a 29-22 lead. Nets: Dinwiddie had his third 30-point game off the bench this season, matching the franchise record set by Clifford T. Robinson in 1980-81. ... The Nets improved to 9-4 in December. MONK'S MOMENT Monk had temporarily fallen out of the rotation, not playing in the last two games as coach James Borrego sought to tighten up the team's defense. He said he simply lost the ball with his chance to win his return to game action. ""Probably too happy I was in that situation, but I've got to move forward and be ready for Friday,"" he said. DECEMBER TO REMEMBER The Nets' nine wins equals their best December since also winning nine in 2014. They won only eight games combined in October and November.","401071181"
"MIAMI --  Danny Green slipped to the right corner, somehow forgotten by the Miami Heat. He made them pay. Kawhi Leonard scored 30 points, Green's 3-pointer with 22.7 seconds left -- a wide-open one -- became the gamewinner, and the Toronto Raptors improved the NBA's best record to 26-10 by topping the Heat 106-104 on Wednesday night. Toronto has now won three games this season when trailing by 17 points. ""We've always got a chance to come back,"" Fred VanVleet said. Green had 18 points and VanVleet added 16 for the Raptors, who survived a wild fourth quarter that saw 12 lead changes and four ties. Miami had three shots on the game's final possession, with Dwyane Wade and Justise Winslow missing 3s and Wade having a chance at a tip-in that wouldn't fall. Wade blamed himself for Green being so open, acknowledging that he blew the coverage. ""I'm not mad at the loss. I'm mad at the way I played,"" Wade said. ""You're going to lose games in this league. That's fine. We've been playing good basketball and we played some good basketball today. ... Losses are going to happen. It's the way you bounce back from them and the last few times we've had losses we've bounced back pretty well."" Winslow scored 21 points for Miami, which saw its five-game winning streak snapped. Josh Richardson scored 17 and Hassan Whiteside scored 16 for Miami, which was 6 for 12 from the foul line -- while Toronto was 19 for 23. James Johnson and Tyler Johnson each scored 12 for the Heat, while Wade had 10. Pascal Siakam added 10 for the Raptors. Winslow's layup with 35.2 seconds left put Miami up by one, and on the next Toronto possession Green found himself wide-open in the right corner -- nearly the identical spot from where Ray Allen hit a 3-pointer to deny Green and Leonard the 2013 NBA title when they were with San Antonio. Green connected, the Raptors got the game's last stop and escaped to move to 7-0 against the Southeast Division this season. ""Gutsy win by us at the end,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Miami led 58-44 at the half and extended the lead to 17 early in the third quarter, before Toronto went to a zone -- the defense that the Heat have been using so well of late -- and the game changed. VanVleet made three 3s and had 11 points while Leonard added 10 in what became a 31-12 run over the last 8:10 of the quarter by the Raptors, and they took an 81-79 lead into the fourth. Winslow made a wild layup for a 99-93 lead that came after an 8-0 Miami run -- and the Raptors needed about a minute to respond with a lead-taking 8-0 run of their own. VanVleet connected on a 3, Siakam added a three-point play and Leonard drew a blocking call against Winslow that the Heat didn't like with 1:19 left that he turned into a pair of free throws and a 101-99 Toronto edge. ""The whistle went my way tonight,"" Leonard said. The lead changed hands four more times from there, Green's 3 marking the last of those. ""There's some really good things going on,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""And it was a great basketball game ... through 47 minutes."" TIP-INS Raptors: It was Leonard's first game in Miami since Oct. 30, 2016. The last time he lost a game on the Heat court was Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals. ... Toronto outrebounded Miami 43-35. Heat: Rodney McGruder was back in the starting lineup, after missing his first game of the year Sunday in Orlando with an illness. ... Miami debuted its ""Sunset Vice"" uniforms, with laser fuchsia the primary color. ... Whiteside was 0 for 3 from the foul line, and is now 5 for his last 36. LOWRY OUT The Raptors were again without point guard Kyle Lowry (back tightness). Lowry has now missed five of Toronto's last six games, the other four absences caused by a thigh issue. ROOKIE PRANK Yante Maten led the Heat onto the floor for pregame warmups. He ran out, turned and saw no teammates with him -- they all stayed back for about a minute in an oft-used prank, enjoying a good laugh. To his credit, Maten also laughed.","401071182"
"CHICAGO --  For much of his seven seasons with the Bulls, Derrick Rose was a favorite son of Chicago. He was native born and virtually universally beloved. Things, though, soured towards the end as injuries mounted. The former franchise player was traded in 2016 and serenaded with boos upon his return a few months later. The 30-year-old is hoping Wednesday night began a new chapter in his relationship with his hometown. Rose had 24 points and eight assists in just his second career game in the United Center against his former team, lifting the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-94 victory. He was cheered loudly throughout by the sellout crowd of 21,852. ""It was great, man,"" he said. ""I didn't expect it to be like this -- overwhelming at some points. You can tell the support is still here."" Rose, the top pick in the 2008 draft, was named the NBA's most valuable player in 2011. He had missed Minnesota's previous game with a sore left ankle. Because of an assortment of injuries, this was just his fourth career game against the Bulls. He said he got 50 tickets for family and friends. ""I'm happy I didn't change throughout this whole process,"" he said. ""I remained myself. I stayed true to my family. There was a lot of people that jumped off the boat when I was going through things. I (saw) who they were. I know what's fake love and what's real love."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 20 points and 20 rebounds as the Timberwolves won their second straight on the road. Zach LaVine had 28 points in 26 minutes off the bench and Lauri Markkanen added 16 for Chicago, which had won two straight and three of five before Wednesday. LaVine had missed the previous five games with a sprained left ankle. ""I thought he looked good and aggressive,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said of LaVine. ""I like when he drives the ball. He attacked on his first two touches and sometimes that can get you going."" Both Rose and fellow former Bull Taj Gibson received loud ovations when they were announced during player introductions. Towns scored the game's first basket, but it was Rose who set the tone early. He repeatedly attacked the basket -- showing the form of earlier in his career before the rash of leg injuries -- and had 10 points (5-for-8 shooting) and five assists in the first quarter as Minnesota took a 29-18 lead. The Timberwolves' advantage was up to 60-37 at halftime. Rose had 19 points through three quarters as Minnesota took an 83-65 edge into the fourth. The Bulls pulled within 91-74, but Rose stopped the momentum with a jumper and Dario Saric added a 3-pointer on the next possession for a 96-74 lead with just over seven minutes remaining. Later in the fourth, the UC crowd started chanting, ""MVP... MVP... MVP..."" when Rose stepped to the foul line to complete a 3-point play. ""I had to crack a smile a little bit,"" he said. ""It made me reminisce about some of the old days and how grateful I was to be in that position at a young age. ""With the year I'm having, it's very special to come back here and play."" GOOD HEALTH Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said Rose (averaging 18.7 points on 48.9 percent shooting) is playing at an All-Star level. When asked if he thought that was possible when Minnesota picked up the guard late last season -- after he was waived by Utah -- Thibodeau said: ""I did. The thing that people forget about Derrick is he was MVP at 22. He was still young and that was the biggest thing. I always felt if he got back to being healthy that he could be very productive."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Gibson finished with 16 points in 26 minutes . G Jeff Teague missed his fifth straight game with a left ankle injury. Bulls: LaVine had been sidelined since injuring the ankle late in the Bulls' 97-91 loss to the Orlando Magic in Mexico City on Dec. 13. He originally was expected to be sidelined two to four weeks. ""Ankle hurt a little bit,"" he said. ""I got tired of sitting down. It still hurts a little bit, but I'll be OK.""","401071183"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies took advantage when Cleveland missed its first 12 shots. Then the Cavaliers came storming back, and Marc Gasol and his teammates had just enough to hold on for a wire-to-wire win. Gasol had 20 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and the Grizzlies beat the Cavaliers 95-87 on Wednesday night despite nearly blowing a 17-point fourth-quarter lead. ""They're a team that doesn't quit. They have a really good coach and some young talent over there,"" Memphis guard Mike Conley said of the Cavaliers and coach Larry Drew. ""We had to finish the game out."" Kyle Anderson and Conley added 15 points each, with Conley handing out eight assists. Garrett Temple and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 11 points each. Cleveland dropped its fourth straight. Jordan Clarkson led the Cavaliers with 24 points off the bench, and rookie Collin Sexton had 16 points and six assists. Cedi Osman had 10 points. Memphis led from the first possession and built up the advantage during Cleveland's 0-for-12 shooting slump. The Grizzlies were up 78-62 about midway through the fourth quarter, but Cleveland rallied to get within 86-82 on a drive by Osman with 1:19 left. ""We were just playing hard, trying to cut the lead and win the game,"" Clarkson said of the burst, adding: ""I mean we were right there, making plays. It just didn't come out our way."" After Memphis' timeout, Conley scored on an acrobatic layup and had a steal before he was fouled. When the Grizzlies point guard converted both free throws, the lead was back to 90-82, and the Grizzlies finished out their second straight win. The late rally seemed contrary to a game that started so poorly for the Cavaliers, who had only one made free throw until the 4:26 mark of the first. ""It was the start of the game that really put us in a little bit of a hole,"" Drew said. ""The first six minutes, we just couldn't make a shot."" Despite the poor start, the Cavaliers still were within striking distance before Conley's four straight points. ""That's a solid team,"" Anderson said of Cleveland. ""Their record doesn't do them justice. They're still a bunch of good guys that play together."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's 32 first-half points were a season low for any half this season, one less than in Sunday's loss to the Chicago Bulls. ... G David Nwaba did not play because of a left ankle sprain from Sunday's loss. ... G Rodney Hood sat out his second game with left Achilles tendon soreness. ... Sexton has reached double-figures in 29 games. Grizzlies: Memphis has played on the day after Christmas every year since 2005 but had lost the previous seven games on Dec. 26. ... Before Wednesday's win, the last wire-to-wire victory was March 17 of last season over Denver ... Conley was 6 of 16 from the floor, including missing all five of his 3-point shots. ... All five Memphis starters reached double figures, the fourth time in the last five games. ... Gasol had four blocks, part of Memphis recording 10 blocks in the game. SLOW START The Cavs had nine points in the first quarter, a season low for any period. Channing Frye hit a 3-pointer with 4:24 left in the first for Cleveland's first field goal. Seven turnovers only contributed to Cleveland's misery. ""Maybe it was Christmas, who knows,"" Clarkson said. ""Maybe everybody (ate) well on Christmas and came in a little slow.""","401071184"
"DALLAS --  Devin Harris faked once, twice, three times before making a 3-pointer in a big fourth quarter for the Dallas Mavericks. There was no such hesitation from 19-year-old Luka Doncic on the decisive play in the final minute. Doncic scored 21 points, including the tiebreaking free throws with 30 seconds left, and the Mavericks ended a six-game losing streak with a 122-119 victory against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night. The rookie sensation drove down the right wing past Julius Randle, and after shaking off his anger over not getting the continuation call when he made the layup, Doncic connected on both free throws for a 121-119 lead. ""I mean, he's a rookie. He's going to have to work for some of those calls,"" said center DeAndre Jordan, who had 20 points and 12 rebounds. ""He's a big, strong body down there who doesn't shy away from the contact."" Doncic did get to the line plenty. The Slovenian guard made his first 11 before missing his final free throw after rebounding a miss on a 3-pointer from Anthony Davis, who had 32 points and 18 rebounds in the fifth consecutive loss for the Pelicans. Davis missed another 3 with a chance to tie in the final seconds, and Doncic got the rebound again to finish one rebound shy of a triple-double. He had 10 assists in the first of two straight games between these teams. All five losses on the New Orleans skid have been by single digits. ""The same stuff. We can't close out a game,"" Davis said after his 23rd double-double. ""I thought we were fighting on the road. Things just weren't going our way."" Harris and fellow backup guard J.J. Barea carried the Mavericks through most of the fourth quarter. The 3 from Harris after faking the shot twice and a pass once was part of his 10-point quarter on the way to 16 for the game, while Barea went 3 of 3 from deep and scored 11 of his 18 points in the fourth. Barea had seven assists and five rebounds. The Mavericks ended a streak of five straight games of allowing at least 120 points while stopping a losing skid that had matched their season high. ""Every little thing that happened positively for us has to happen for us to win that game,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When you have lost six and are desperate to get a win, this is the kind of win you have to have."" Jrue Holiday scored 25 points for New Orleans, and Julius Randle had 23 points, including 11-of-13 shooting on free throws, against his hometown team. TIP-INS Pelicans: The other double-figure scorer was Frank Jackson with 10. ... Tim Frazier had nine points and seven assists. ... Davis had his 12th 30-point game of the season. Mavericks: Nowitzki passed Karl Malone for fourth on the career list of games played at 1,477. Nowitzki has a chance to catch John Stockton (1,504) for third. Malone and Stockton spent 18 seasons together in Utah. ... Jordan was 7 of 7 from the field in his fifth straight double-double and 22nd of the season. ... Harrison Barnes scored 16 points and Maxi Kleber had 10. ... The Mavericks are 14-3 at home with wins in 12 of their past 13 games. BLOCK PARTY Kleber had a career-high six blocks as the Mavericks finished with a season-high 13 less than a week after their first game this season with zero. The LA Clippers shot 57 percent in that 125-121 win over Dallas. ERRANT STEP The Pelicans had just 10 turnovers, but two were for stepping out of bounds in the first half, when they had their biggest lead of nine points. ""That's elementary school,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You can't step out of bounds when we throw you the ball."" SEASON HIGH FOR DIRK Dirk Nowitzki scored a season-high seven points while playing in the second half for the second time in his six games. The 40-year-old hit a 3 late in the third quarter to top his previous high of three points. Nowitzki is in his 21st season with one team, an NBA record. The 13-time All-Star missed the first 26 games with a longer-than-expected recovery from left ankle surgery in April. He became the sixth NBA player with 900 career wins, after the Mavericks lost his first five games. RARE DOUBLE-DOUBLE Teams playing two games in a row against each other, as the Mavericks and Pelicans will do, isn't that unusual. Consecutive sets of such games are a little strange, though. Dallas will do that with two straight against Oklahoma City on back-to-back nights Sunday and Monday.","401071185"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs got a big win and an even bigger boost in confidence. DeMar DeRozan had 30 points, LaMarcus Aldridge scored 27 and San Antonio defeated the Denver Nuggets 111-103 on Wednesday night. Bryn Forbes added 15 points for the resurgent Spurs (19-16), who have won eight of 10 to move within two percentage points of first-place Houston in the Southwest Division. ""It just shows you that we can go out there and compete with the best and why we should look at ourselves as one of the best teams in this league as well,"" DeRozan said. ""Because when we go up against the best, we perform and come out like we did tonight. It's definitely a confidence builder for all of us to understand we can do this."" The Nuggets (21-11) lost their second consecutive game and fell just behind Golden State for the best record in the Western Conference. Denver, which leads the Northwest Division by a half-game over Oklahoma City, is 13-3 at home but 8-8 on the road. The Nuggets were without injured starters Gary Harris, Will Barton and Paul Millsap but still had an 80-79 lead with 10 minutes remaining before they were outscored 23-4. ""They're a hell of a team,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Really well-coached, really active, really execute well. So, it's a fine win for us. We feel really good about it, but realize we've still got a long way to go."" Juancho Hernangomez tied a career high with 27 points and grabbed 13 rebounds for Denver. Malik Beasley added 22 points and Monte Morris had 15, both off the bench, for the Nuggets. Denver center Nikola Jokic was held to four points on 1-for-5 shooting in 31 minutes. ""They played really good defense on Joker,"" Hernangomez said. ""They tried to keep him out of the game. They doubled every time, so I was open most of the time. I've been struggling. ... I'm happy right now to make some shots."" The Nuggets entered shooting 46 percent from the field this season but were limited to 39 percent by the Spurs. San Antonio also blocked four shots, all in the second half. ""It was us turning the ball over, careless passing, missing a lot of open shots,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""You also have to give them credit. They've been playing at a high level on both ends of the floor."" The Spurs went on a 15-0 run after falling behind 80-79 and won for the eighth time in 10 home games. ""We showed that we can play great team defense with a lot of effort, playing together, especially in that second half,"" said center Jakob Poeltl, who had six points and 11 rebounds. Spurs guard Derrick White blocked Jamal Murray's layup attempt on a fast break, which led to a driving dunk by White for a 91-80 lead with 7:28 remaining. Murray was held to nine points and fellow backcourt starter Torrey Craig had 10. The Spurs, who led by as many as 18, were ahead at the end of every quarter despite a drought in the second period. Denver held San Antonio scoreless for 2:42 beginning midway through the second, but the Spurs closed the half on a 10-3 run to claim a 55-53 lead. TIP-INS Nuggets: Barton (right hip), Millsap (broken right toe), Harris (right hip), Isaiah Thomas (right hip surgery), Michael Porter Jr. (lower back surgery) and Jarred Vanderbilt (right foot surgery) all missed the game due to injury. ... The team's previous win in San Antonio came on March 4, 2012. Denver is 19-74 in San Antonio, but holds a winning record over the Spurs at home (48-43). Spurs: Rookie guard Lonnie Walker IV was active for the first time this season after injuring his right knee during the preseason, but did not play. Walker missed the first 20 games and spent the past 14 assigned to the team's G League affiliate. ... Aldridge failed to hit the rim on his only 3-point attempt. ... DeRozan rolled his ankle late in the first half but quickly got up and remained in the game following a timeout. JUST BECAUSE Popovich is not a fan of playing the same opponent in back-to-back games, as the Spurs will do in facing the Nuggets again Friday in Denver. ""I hate them, they're awful,"" Popovich said. ""We have six of them this year; some teams have one or two."" Why such disdain? ""I hate them. I just hate them. I can hate them for whatever reason. You do that in the playoffs, you don't do that now,"" he said. TROJAN MASTER DeRozan became the NBA's leading scorer among players out of USC, moving past Gus Williams for the top spot. DeRozan has 14,112 career points in 10 seasons and Williams had 14,093 in 11 seasons with Golden State, Seattle, Washington and Atlanta. The others in the top five are Paul Westphal (12,809), Bill Sharman (12,653) and Cliff Robinson (10,823). ""Really? Hell, yeah,"" DeRozan said. ""Aw man, I'm in there. Cool. I didn't know that. Damn, OK. See if somebody beats that record.""","401071186"
"LOS ANGELES --  With a 27-point lead quickly disappearing, Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers was left with little choice. It was time to put his five best players back on the floor for the final three minutes. ""I had to,"" Rivers said after the Clippers held off the hard-charging Sacramento Kings 127-118 on Wednesday night. ""The concern level was, can they muster it up? My guess was that somebody had probably taken their (ankle) tape off. Who knows? But they were ready to play and they took care of business as they should."" Lou Williams scored 24 points, Montrezl Harrell added 22 and the Clippers' reserves led the way even though every Los Angeles starter reached double figures for the first time this season. Tobias Harris had 17 points and Avery Bradley scored 15. De'Aaron Fox finished with 19 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic had 13 for the Kings, who put together a 19-0 run in the fourth quarter to give the Clippers a scare. Buddy Hield scored 11, ending his seven-game streak with 20 or more. ""We've got to do a better job defending,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We struggled to defend again. We allowed 71 points in the first half, too many points in the paint, they shot 50 percent and had 14 offensive rebounds. That's too high a number. Too many straight-line drives to the basket."" And yet the Kings made a run just as the Clippers thought they might. Sacramento overcame 19-point deficits to win each of its previous two games. ""We know that is a team that fights from being down a lot,"" Harrell said. ""We know this team has been down 19, 20-plus points before and they made runs to come back. We give them credit for what they do well. We put the bench in and guys didn't go in ready."" Harrell and Williams technically are members of that bench as well. But in the fourth quarter, with games on the line, both see playing time. And even that unit had trouble stopping the momentum supplied mostly by Sacramento's backups. ""All those guys were ready for their opportunities and they got it today,"" Fox said. ""Everybody was ready. Guys just came out to play. Our starting group, the guys that play a lot, we cheer for them. That's just the type of group we are."" Yogi Ferrell's jumper with 2:14 left pulled the Kings to 119-115, but Harrell scored inside on the Clippers' next trip down the floor for the first Los Angeles field goal since Williams hit a 3-pointer with 8:14 to go. Frank Mason's 3-pointer got the Kings to 121-118 with 1:12 left, but Williams followed with a fadeaway with 42 seconds remaining and the Clippers sealed the game from the free throw line. Danilo Gallinari had 14 points, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 12 and Boban Marjanovic added 11 for the Clippers, who have won three of four. Iman Shumpert scored 12 points for the Kings.

The comparison was fitting after Harrell had nine rebounds, five blocked shots and two steals. ""He's so relentless and at one point with the rebounds under the basket, he reminds you of Barkley at times,"" Rivers said. ""When you played against Barkley, you felt like it was his ball, like he was due the basketball. It was almost like he was entitled to it and that's how (Harrell) plays."" Harrell appreciated the comparison. ""It's a blessing, man,"" Harrell said. ""That's one of the game's greats as a power forward. He was an undersized guy who definitely competed and he was a force to be reckoned with. It's a blessing that my coach feels that way about me, but I can't stop there. I have to keep working.""

"HOUSTON --  James Harden thinks he should be in the MVP discussion again this season and showed why on Thursday night. Harden had 45 points and six assists, Clint Capela added 24 points and 18 rebounds, and the Houston Rockets beat the Boston Celtics 127-113 for their eighth win in nine games. ""Of course, I should be in that conversation,"" Harden, the reigning MVP, said. ""I received a lot of hate, but it won't stop me from going out there and killing it every single night and being the dog that I am. You can name a few other people that can be in that conversation, but realistically, it's coming back."" Harden, who was playing on a bruised left calf, had 17 points in the first quarter and finished 11 of 26 from the field, including 9 of 18 on 3-pointers. ""You take those shots, you're confident in those shots and those shots will go in,"" Harden said. ""Sometimes they might not go in, but mostly, they'll go in. I just have to keep going, keep working."" Eric Gordon scored 20 points for Houston, which shot 48 percent while improving to a season-high four games above .500. Houston finished 18 of 45 on 3-pointers. ""He has a mastery of the game and a control and an ease of which he plays,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said of Harden. ""It's fun to watch."" Harden has scored at least 30 points in eight straight games, the longest such streak since Russell Westbrook had eight straight 30-point games in November 2016. Harden has scored at least 35 points in six straight games, the longest streak since Carmelo Anthony had six straight in April 2013. ""I think what James is doing is really special because he's really carrying us right now,"" Gerald Green said. ""Not only is he scoring, he's leading us."" Kyrie Irving had 23 points and 11 assists, Marcus Morris added 19 points before being ejected midway through the fourth quarter, and Jaylen Brown had 18 points off the bench for Boston, which shot 47 percent but was outrebounded 54-38. ""The first 18 minutes and then the last 24 minutes, the glass killed us,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""I thought the restricted area generally on both sides of the floor, our finishing and our lack of rebounding were separators."" The Rockets used a 14-4 run to end the third and start the fourth to open up a 103-90 lead on back-to-back 3-pointers by Green with 9 minutes remaining. Boston got no closer than 10 the rest of the way. ""We just weren't covering up for one another consistently enough,"" Irving said. ""That's really what it comes down to."" Houston opened up a 41-24 advantage a minute into the second on 3-pointer by Danuel House Jr. Trailing 50-33, Boston used a 22-7 run to end the half, aided by three technical fouls against the Rockets in barely a minute, to cut the lead to 57-55 on Marcus Smart's 3-pointer. Irving had seven in the run. TIP-INS Celtics: Aron Baynes (broken finger) missed his fourth straight game. ... Robert Williams missed the game with a sore left leg. ..

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo held down his usual spot atop the stat sheet, though his most important contribution was keeping his cool. Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 14 rebounds, Khris Middleton added 25 points and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the New York Knicks 112-96 on Thursday night for their sixth win in seven games. Antetokounmpo was assessed a technical foul, but remained in the game after a brief altercation midway through the fourth quarter with Enes Kanter, who was ejected. ""I think it's one of his strengths,"" said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""We've talked about during this season, there can be frustration when things are missed, or you see things certain ways. He just tends to keep his focus, keep his composure, go to the next play."" The Bucks swept the home-and-home series, having won at New York 109-95 on Christmas. Milwaukee is a season-high 14 games above .500. Luke Kornet, making his first start of the season in place of Kanter, tied a career high with 23 points, and Noah Vonleh added 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks. New York, playing without leading scorer Tim Hardaway Jr. because of an illness, lost its sixth straight. Kanter was ejected with 9:56 left in the fourth quarter after being assessed two technical fouls. Antetokounmpo drove to the basket and was knocked down by Kanter, although no foul was called. The two got into a brief altercation as Antetokounmpo ran back up the court. After a review, each player was called for a technical, then Kanter was called for a second. Kanter was hit near his eye on the previous play at the other end, eventually requiring three stitches. ""I shot the ball and I was trying to go get the rebound, offensive rebound,"" Kanter said. ""I think Thon Maker's elbow just glanced against my eye and it started bleeding. And then on the other side I think Giannis was driving the basket and I stopped him. They didn't even call a foul. And then we just got into it a little bit. And then my eye was bleeding and they said, `you need stitches.' So I went in the back and the doctor just give me three stitches. Now you guys are telling me I got ejected."" With half a quarter to play and the Knicks within 91-82, Antetokounmpo said it was important he remain in the game. ""At the end of the day, I have to help my team and close out the game,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We had like eight or nine minutes left and I was just thinking about closing out the game. I just do not like when dirty plays happen that risk my health or my teammates' health. I don't like that."" Referee Brian Forte said there were two situations that led to Kanter's ejection. ""During instant replay review for the altercation, we observed an unsportsmanlike act by Kanter and that is what led to his first technical foul,"" Forte told a pool reporter. ""After the out-of-bounds foul, Giannis and Kanter came face-to-face and so they were both assessed dead ball technical fouls,"" Forte said. Milwaukee used an 18-2 run midway through the second quarter to open a 44-37 lead. The Bucks extended the lead to 87-77 entering the final period. The Bucks, who entered second in the league in both 3-pointers made and attempted, missed their first eight 3-point attempts. New York went up 23-13 on Kevin Knox's 3-pointer with 4:40 left in the first quarter, but Milwaukee responded with an 11-2 run. TIP-INS Knicks: New York opened a six-game road trip, which now heads west for five games that include teams with four of the six best records in the Western Conference. ""I think it's good for us,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Fifteen days out and just us, together going through the gauntlet of good teams. I think that's a great experience for this team."" Bucks: Milwaukee opened a six-game homestand against the Knicks, who entered 9-26. Of the next five opponents, only Toronto (26-10) is above .500.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Lakers looked just fine for 3  1/2 quarters in their first game without LeBron James. Down the stretch it was a different story, when the four-time MVP's absence was noticeable and costly, even as coach Luke Walton found a variety of other reasons to blame. Bogdan Bogdanovic made a 3-pointer at the buzzer and the Sacramento Kings rallied from 15 points down in the fourth quarter to beat Los Angeles 117-116 on Thursday night. ""This is the first close game we've been in that he's not there,"" Walton said. ""If LeBron James is playing in that game it probably finishes a little differently. When you get the best closer in the game on your team, then you rely on him to do that. All that said, we made enough plays to win."" Not quite enough. Los Angeles led 104-89 with 6:44 remaining following a dunk by Tyson Chandler before Sacramento surged back. Bogdanovic, who had 11 points through three quarters, sparked the comeback with 12 points in the fourth, including a pair of buckets from beyond the arc. After Justin Jackson made three free throws to tie the score at 112, Kyle Kuzma made a 3-pointer with 41 seconds remaining. De'Aaron Fox followed with two free throws for Sacramento, and Kyle Kuzma made one of two for Los Angeles with 4.6 left. Following a timeout, Bogdanovic got the ball outside the arc and launched a 27-footer over the 7-foot-1 Chandler for the game-winner. ""We switched and I don't think we necessarily should have switched but credit to him, he made a hell of a shot over a 7-footer at the buzzer,"" Kuzma said. ""It's always a tough way to lose."" James was held out with a groin injury, ending his consecutive games played streak at 156. He was injured during the Lakers' 127-101 victory over two-time defending NBA champion Golden State on Christmas when he slipped while going for a loose ball. Kuzma had 34 points to help make up for James' absence, and Lonzo Ball added 20 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds. But the Lakers struggled down the stretch and lost their fourth in six games. Walton blamed the loss on his team's failures in rebounding and defense late in the game and not on James' absence. ""Those type of things are what cost us the game, not not having him at the end or that shot that Bogdanovic hit,"" Walton said. Bogdanovic finished with 23 points and Fox added 15 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds for Sacramento. Willie Cauley-Stein had 19 points and eight rebounds, while Iman Shumpert scored 18 points and matched his career high with six 3s. ""We keep things interesting,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We scrambled around and got loose balls and were able to get out in transition. Heck of a win."" BALL MISSING AT THE END Ball was on the bench for the final few minutes after checking out of the game due to cramping. Ball said after the game he was fine and expects to play against the Clippers on Friday.

"Ben Simmons responds to Utah Jazz fans calling him trash by silencing them with a triple-double. (1:05) SALT LAKE CITY --  It's no secret that Joel Embiid likes to talk. ""I love talking trash. That's my nature. But it's all fun and jokes,"" Embiid said. Embiid has been avoiding making waves on social media lately but when he noticed that Utah fans had plenty to say, he just couldn't help himself. ""I can't let people just talk trash to me, I got to talk and back it up,"" said Embiid, who had 23 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks to help the Philadelphia 76ers cruise past the Jazz, 114-97 on Thursday night. ""With the help of my teammates, we backed it up on the court and that allowed me to express myself."" JJ Redick helped Embiid say whatever he wanted by scoring 24 points and his shooting opened the court for the big man. Ben Simmons, who was selected over Utah's Donovan Mitchell as Rookie of the Year last season and heard boos whenever he touched the ball, had his fifth triple-double of the season with 13 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. ""Ben spoke with his play,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""He was dominant."" When Simmons lobbed the ball to Jimmy Butler for a dunk and his 10th assist, he exchanged words with some fans on the baseline. ""I got a triple-double,"" he yelled. ""I love being able to come into an arena and hear boos and chants and see signs and then win by 20. There's nothing better than that,"" Simmons said. Mitchell scored 23 points, Dante Exum added a season-high 20 and Rudy Gobert had 17 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz. ""I think our offense kind of affected our defense tonight,"" Mitchell said. ""They had many transition opportunities and a lot of transition buckets."" Embiid, who has a league-leading 31 double-doubles, and Gobert both had bright moments in the post but the Jazz let Redick get loose for six 3-pointers. ""I was patient. I got a couple looks in transition, but other than that I was just making good reads and one-dribble 3-pointers leaning one way or the other,"" Redick said, while joking he made his first spin move since 2015. Butler scored 19 points. The 76ers (23-13) were able to disrupt the Jazz offensive sets and force them into shots they don't usually take. Utah shot 38 percent from the field. On the other end, crisp passing and constant movement off the ball kept the 76ers one step ahead all night. Utah came into the game with the best defensive rating over the last 10 games, per NBA stats, but the 76ers shot 50 percent and racked up 31 assists. ""Usually when we make a mistake, we cover it up quick,"" Gobert said. ""Tonight I feel we just weren't getting to the next play ... we got stuck in the past."" Embiid and Redick each had 10 points in the second quarter as the 76ers shot 75 percent in the period to turn a seven-point deficit into a 57-52 halftime lead. The 24-8 run continued through much of the third quarter and Philadelphia led 76-60 after Mike Muscala sank a 3-pointer. The Jazz never got within 15 points the rest of the way. According to the Brown, the difference was Embiid's voice -- just in a different way than most people recognize. ""If you mic'ed him up for the game, just listen to his voice. He's our commander in chief, behind the scenes,"" Brown said. ""He does it with authority and an element of intellect."" WHO IS THE REAL DEFENSIVE POY? Embiid said the Defensive Player of Year award is the one he covets more than any other honor. ""I want to be a complete player,"" he said. ""There's not a lot of guys that do it at both ends. It's hard."" Brown thinks his big man is on his way. ""I think we're all seeing the impact Joel Embiid has defensively,"" Brown said. ""In my opinion he is the Defensive Player of the Year ... his impact on this team is overwhelming."" TIP-INS 76ers: The Sixers shot 14 free throws in the third quarter (making 12) after shooting just two free throws in the entire first half. ... Redick had a four-point play in the second quarter. ... With 4:21 to play, Embiid fouled out just one point shy of 3,000 in his career when he fell and took out Rubio's legs on a play that looked like a diving football tackle. Jazz: Kyle Korver beat the shot clock and was fouled for a four-point play of his own in the first quarter, when he scored 10 points. ... Gobert has 30 double-doubles. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Damian Lillard certainly left his mark over the years at Oracle Arena, and again in perhaps his final visit to a building he frequented as an NBA-crazed boy. Lillard hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds left in overtime and scored 21 points back home in Oakland, sending the Portland Trail Blazers past the Golden State Warriors 110-109 in a wild one Thursday night. Lillard shot 7 for 20 with friends and family cheering him in the Blazers' final scheduled trip to Oracle Arena before the Warriors move to San Francisco next season. ""That's a hell of a way to go out,"" Lillard said. ""We needed this win. It was a big game for us, especially having to play them two times in a row, having to play such a solid game."" Kevin Durant missed a 13-footer off the front rim as the final buzzer sounded but finished with his second triple-double of the season: 26 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. ""I've got to make that shot, plain and simple,"" Durant said. Jusuf Nurkic had 27 points and 12 rebounds for the Blazers, who helped coach Terry Stotts pass Rick Adelman for second place on the Blazers' career wins list with 292 behind Jack Ramsay's 453. Stotts sipped some celebratory bubbly afterward. The Warriors couldn't overcome a comedy of errors in losing a second straight at home. They took a 127-101 beating from the Lakers on Christmas night. Seth Curry largely outplayed big brother and Golden State star Stephen -- whose poor pass with the Warriors leading by two was stolen on the sequence that led to Lillard's shot. Stephen Curry made a 3-pointer with 10:46 to play in regulation, then his little brother rattled off 11 in a row with three consecutive 3s. Klay Thompson's shooting struggles continued. He went 6 for 19 and was just 2 of 9 on 3-point tries on the way to 15 points. Curry's 33-footer with 8:42 left in the third on a pass from Draymond Green got Golden State within two, then Curry found Green for a tying layup the next time down to make it 55-all. A series of silly mistakes followed: Thompson made a steal and threw it toward midcourt and Green couldn't keep the ball from going over the line for a backcourt violation, as Portland regained possession. Then, Green clanked a one-handed dunk try off the back of the rim. This after he had earlier thrown a pass off Thompson's head. The Warriors missed nine of their initial 11 free throws and finished an uncharacteristic 6 for 15 at the line. ""Unacceptable to miss that many free throws,"" Durant said. In the opener of a home-and-home series, both teams were trying to rebound from embarrassing Christmas losses in which the 3-point shooting was dismal: Golden State following that flop to the Lakers at home and the Blazers a 117-96 defeat at Utah. In his last five games against the Warriors, Lillard has averaged 31 points, shooting 42.4 percent and 38.8 percent on 3s. ""I represent this city, so when I come here I want to represent myself well. I have a lot of family and friends coming to see me play, so you're excited about that. You've got energy, that's what it is,"" Lillard said. LILLARD'S ORACLE MEMORIES When Lillard was 9 or 10, he came to a Rockets-Warriors game with his brother and lucked into getting to take a shot on the court. ""My brother and I were up at our seats and Steve Francis was doing his pregame workout and the ball bounced up and into the stands and I ran down the stairs and got it and I was going to throw it back and he was like, `No, come shoot it.' And I went on the court and shot a 3 and airballed. That's the story."" Lillard clearly had mixed emotions about the Warriors' upcoming move, saying: ""You wish it wasn't happening. You know how much it means to the city of Oakland to have something positive happening, especially with the team having so much success right now. ... So it's sad to see them moving on."" SELLOUT STREAK Golden State's 311th straight sellout Thursday became a new franchise best, topping a run of 310 consecutive sellouts from March 9, 1989, to April 19, 1996. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland pushed Golden State into nine first-half turnovers while committing just two. ... The Blazers were 21 of 23 on free throws. Warriors: Durant has scored 20 or more points in his last nine games 23 of 24. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  With 8  1/2 minutes remaining, Hornets coach James Borrego subbed out Tony Parker. The 18-year veteran gave Borrego a quizzical look as he walked toward the bench, then quickly told the coach he wasn't tired. Borrego wasted no time sending Parker to the scorer's table to check back in. It was a good decision. Parker re-entered the game and scored 17 of his 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting over the final 6:41 to help Charlotte hold off Brooklyn 100-87 on Friday and avenge a double-overtime loss to the Nets two nights earlier. ""He thought I was getting tired,"" Parker said. ""I told him, `I'm not tired. I'm ready to go.' He's always worried about my body and my age and thinking about the big picture, because the most important time of the year is the playoffs. But at the same time I tell him, `J.B., we still have to get into the playoffs first."" The Hornets once again used the small but speedy backcourt of Parker and Kemba Walker to close out a win to pull even at .500 on the season. ""I think the fourth quarter fuels a number of players,"" Borrego said. ""Not every player, but the special ones are fueled by the fourth. It's winning time, and both (Parker and Walker) are fueled by it."" Walker scored 29 points and made seven 3-pointers -- most of them playing off the ball -- and the Nets seemed to have no answer for the combination. ""Speed kills in this league,"" said Nets coach Kenny Atkinson. ""They got by us, whether it was in the pick-and-roll or just 1-on-1 defense. They got into the heart of defense and really hurt us."" The Hornets (17-17) bounced back from a difficult loss in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, when they surrendered an eight-point lead with 3 minutes remaining in regulation and were beaten when Joe Harris stole a loose ball at midcourt and drove for the go-ahead layup with 3.4 seconds left in the second OT for a 134-132 victory. Charlotte seemed extra motivated coming out of the gates, jumping out to a 35-17 lead in the first quarter behind 15 points from Jeremy Lamb and 10 from Cody Zeller, who finished with a double-double. ""Our start to this game was fueled by what happened the other night,"" Borrego said. ""We gave that game away."" TIP-INS Nets: DeMarre Carroll had 15 points off the bench. ... Allowed 54 points in the paint. Hornets: The team honored longtime broadcaster Steve Martin at halftime for his 30 years of service. ... Nic Batum and Marvin Williams, two of the most composed Hornets players, both picked up rare technical fouls in the third quarter. RUSSELL CARRIES NETS D'Angelo Russell was the only Nets starter to finish in double digits, scoring 33 points on 13-of-24 shooting. The Nets lost for only the second time in the last 11 games. Spencer Dinwiddie, who had 37 points and 11 assists in the Nets' win over the Hornets on Wednesday night, was held to three points on 1-of-7 shooting. Harris had just four points after scoring 27 in the previous matchup. The Nets were just 4 of 27 from beyond the arc after making 19 3s on Wednesday night. ""They did a better job of being more aggressive and switching out,"" Harris said. MORE SUBSTITUING With the Nets traveling to Milwaukee for the second night of a back-to-back on Saturday, Atkinson said he'll likely need to play his bench more because his starters looked tired. ""We weren't ready physically or mentally,"" Atkinson said. ""I think physically they dominated us and then we made a bunch of breakdowns, a bunch of breakdowns in our man-to-man defense and we had to resort to zone again just because we couldn't stop them in our man-to-man.""

"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers have taken adversity and used it to their advantage during a breakout December. That run continued Friday night, when Domantas Sabonis got his league-leading 15th double-double as a reserve, Collison scored 19 points and the Indiana Pacers beat the Detroit Pistons 125-88. At the start of the month, the Pacers were without All-Star guard Victor Oladipo and spinning their tires with a 13-10 record. Indiana struggled when Oladipo was injured last season. This year, they used his absence to figure out how to compete without him, and that paid off Friday when Oladipo had a quiet night from the field. ""We fixed things (while) playing without Vic,"" Darren Collison said. ""We didn't play as well last year (without Oladip)) so we took it upon us to play well until he got back, and now we're playing even better."" Oladipo has been back in Indiana's lineup since Dec. 12, but against Detroit he scored only seven points. The Pacers, much like they did in his absence, relied on an onslaught of scoring from their other four starters and key contributions off of the bench. Sabonis had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Thaddeus Young and Myles Turner each had 17 points. Bojan Bogdanovic and Doug McDermott each scored 12 points. Indiana is a league best 11-3 since Dec. 1 and has the third-best record in the NBA. The Pacers are 7-2 since Oladipo's return, but it was a 4-1 stretch prior to his return that gave the Pacers the confidence and know-how to pull out games without a major contribution from their best player. Oladipo chalked up the lackluster Friday to his gradual return to form, but noted a win is all he's ever concerned with. ""I'm comfortable with winning. I love it,"" Oladipo said. ""I've got to find other ways to score and be effective, make the right play. My flow, my rhythm will come back."" The Pacers scored the first eight points of the game and led Detroit 32-21 at the end of the first period. Indiana worked with a double-digit lead for the rest of the game and led by 37 during the fourth quarter. Detroit's two big men had quiet nights by their standards. Blake Griffin had 18 points and six rebounds, and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Pistons came out flat, contributing to a stale first few minutes. Unlike Indiana, which had seven players in double figures, Detroit didn't have someone step up to ignite the offense. The Pistons shot only 37 percent from the floor. ""I first want to apologize to the fans of the Detroit Pistons,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""That's one of the worst exhibitions we've put out on the floor. We've gotta have more pride than what we played with tonight."" USING A SCREEN Griffin brought a tablet onto the court to argue a call with official J.T. Orr during the second half. It's unclear which call Griffin was disputing, but Orr patiently watched the replay on Griffin's device before appearing to offer an explanation to the Pistons star. TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond entered the game leading the league with 15.4 rebounds per game. He got his 28th double-double of the season. ... The Pistons are 5-14 against teams at or above .500. ... Detroit's 88 points tied for the second fewest the Pacers have allowed this season. Pacers: The Pacers shot 71 percent from the floor during the first quarter, recording 12 assists on 15 baskets. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic have had a forgettable December -- until Friday night. Nikola Vucevic had 30 points and 20 rebounds and the Magic snapped a four-game losing streak with a 116-87 rout of the Toronto Raptors. D.J. Augustin had 17 points and six assists for Orlando, which had five players in double figures and a 60-41 rebounding advantage. Vucevic became the third player this decade, fifth this century and ninth in the last 44 years to post at least 30 points, 20 rebounds and eight assists in a game, the Magic said. Charles Barkley (three times), DeMarcus Cousins (twice), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, George McGinnis, David Lee, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Alex English are the other players to accomplish the feat since 1974. ""I think guys understood that it was time for us to turn things around,"" Vucevic said.  ""Tonight everything clicked for us on both ends, but defense is probably the main reason we won."" After making eight of their first 12 shots, including a couple of 3-pointers by Fred VanVleet, the Raptors took a 19-9 lead. But Toronto made just 11 of its next 51 shots until Kawhi Leonard dunked late in the third quarter with Orlando leading 91-60. ""This is a big boy's league and these nights happen, it's nothing new,"" VanVleet said. ""We are not the first team to lose like this."" The Magic, who had lost five straight to Toronto, outscored the Raptors 51-16 over a 16-minute span of the middle periods and led by as many as 31 points late in the third quarter. Leonard scored 21 points for the Raptors, who shot 29.5 percent in the final game of a three-game trip. Serge Ibaka added 17 points and eight rebounds. The Raptors (26-11) came into the game with the best record in the Eastern Conference, but fell percentage points behind Milwaukee with the loss. ""It's the reality of this league -- every team in our league will have a win like that,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. ""We were good tonight. I thought we were more physical. I thought Vucevic was terrific and Aaron Gordon was lights-out. He only took six shots."" Gordon got most of the credit for holding Leonard to 11 points after the first 10 minutes. Leonard had averaged 30.1 points in the 10 preceding games. ""We were all tied together on defense, all in the right spots, and we executed the game plan. That was probably the best we've done it all year,"" said Gordon, who had nine points and nine rebounds. Vucevic scored 12 points during a 21-6 run late in the first half that turned the game around. D.J. Augustin scored six straight points to stretch Orlando's lead to 17 with 8:15 left in the third quarter, and the Raptors never threatened after that. ""We never really could get stops,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""We couldn't finish at the rim very well. It was really a poor night for all of us. We were trying to shut the water off and we couldn't."" TIP-INS Raptors: G Kyle Lowry sat out a second straight game with lower back pain. Lowry has played only once since Dec. 12. ... The Raptors entered the game with the NBA's best record and as the only team in the top 10 in scoring offense and defense. Magic: Jonathon Simmons played 20 minutes as the backup point guard. ... The Magic won in their home arena for the first time since mid-November. They won two ""home"" games in Mexico City in mid-December, but lost all six in Orlando since beating the New York Knicks on Nov. 18. ... The 29.5 opposing field goal percentage is the fifth-lowest ever against the Magic.","401071195"
"WASHINGTON --  Chicago Bulls coach Jim Boylen knows that Zach LaVine can't play as much he'd like due to a recent ankle injury. But LaVine made the most of his 29 minutes on Friday night, scoring 19 points in the second half, including 11 straight in the third quarter, in the Bulls' 101-92 victory over the Washington Wizards. LaVine, who finished with 24 points, shot just three times in the first half, and turned aggressive in the second half, hitting three 3-pointers in a 2:45 stretch of the third quarter. ""He didn't panic, he wasn't flustered and the game turned for him,"" Boylen said. ""He gave it to us the second half."" Wendell Carter, Jr. had 17 points and 13 rebounds, and Lauri Markkanen added 14 points and 14 rebounds for Chicago, which scored 100 points for just the second time in 10 games. The Bulls have won three of four and are 5-7 since Boylen replaced Fred Hoiberg on Dec. 4. Bradley Beal led Washington with 34 points. The Wizards played without John Wall, who was sidelined with a sore left heel. Washington coach Scott Brooks said that he found out during the morning shootaround that Wall would be unable to play, and said he would see a specialist. The Wizards fell to 13-23. They've dropped nine of 11. Beal remains convinced that Washington can turn the season around, and he refuses to believe that with the team 10 games below .500, the season is too far gone. ""I'll never say that,"" Beal said. ""I'll never think it. I'll never believe it. My main objective is to make sure we get out of the hole and we will."" LAVINE TURNS IT ON Not only did LaVine score 11 straight in the third quarter, but he secured the game with 33 seconds left with a three-point play. ""We took the game over,"" LaVine said. ""We made some big stops. I think the main thing is that we're learning how to win."" PLAYING TOGETHER LaVine, Markkanen and Kris Dunn started together for the first time this season. ""We talked about it and I feel like we just got to keep working on doing our stuff and we'll get better,"" Markkanen said. STRANGE LINEUPS Four of the nine players Brooks used are in their first month with the team. They are forwards Trevor Ariza and Sam Dekker and guards Ron Baker and Chasson Randle. ""You're going to have some funky lineups,"" Brooks said. ""There are going to be some strange lineups until some people get back."" TIP INS Bulls: G Brandon Sampson, who was signed to a two-way contract on Thursday, did not travel with the team. . F Bobby Portis was out for his fourth consecutive game with a sprained right ankle. When he suffered the injury, the team said he'd be out one-to-three weeks. Coach Jim Boylen said that he wouldn't guess on a return. ""We're not going to rush him,"" Boylen said. ""Knowing Bobby he'll be rushing himself."" Wizards: Wall missed his fourth game of the season. He was in the locker room before the game, but did not comment on his condition. .

"MIAMI --  Justise Winslow is in a groove. Winslow had 24 points and 11 rebounds and the Miami Heat beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 118-94 on Friday night. ""You can tell the game is now slowing down for him and once the game slows down for you, it's scary how good you can be. So we all are enjoying it,"" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. Winslow, who recently made the move to be Miami's starting point guard with Goran Dragic sidelined with an injury, added seven assists while helping spark the team's defensive turnaround after the first quarter. ""He has put together some rock-solid floor game and is really inspiring on both ends of the court,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""People only look at that final number on the box score. I don't want that to define the impact that he is making. It's about being a complete basketball player on both ends and he did that tonight."" Winslow has scored at least 20 points in three straight games. He also had a three-game stretch earlier this month where he scored at least 20. ""I think I'm just playing with a lot of instincts and I'm just trying to lead,"" Winslow said. ""I want all of the guys to play free. I want all of the guys to be confident in their shots. I'm going to be confident in mine. I think that's been a big thing of recent. I think we've been just super confident within each other and my teammates have been super confident with me."" Bam Adebayo made all eight shots and scored 18 points, Josh Richardson added 16 points and Rodney McGruder chipped in 13 as seven players scored in double figures for the Heat, who have won six of seven. Jordan Clarkson had 18 points for the Cavaliers, who have lost five straight. ""We didn't make any shots tonight,"" Clarkson said. ""We got some good looks we just didn't knock them down. But at the same time we have to attack the zone as well, get in the paint, kick out and make the shots easier."" It was the 15th consecutive home win for Miami over Cleveland. The Cavs' last win in Miami was Jan. 25, 2010 -- a game where LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal both started for Cleveland. The last time the Cavs won in Miami without LeBron James was Dec. 21, 2001. Cleveland shot 58 percent (11 of 19) in the first quarter for a 30-29 lead, but just 32 percent (20 of 62) the rest of the game, finishing at 39 percent. ""We talk about being a good defensive team and we've been a good defensive team this whole month so we knew we had to turn it around or we knew we was going to be in for a dog fight,"" Wade said.

He's been putting in great work, but it hasn't been 5-on-5 and that's the next step for him."" WADE GIVES JERSEY TO BOSH Wade has been giving his jersey to an opposing player after each game in his final season, but this time he gave one to former Heat teammate Chris Bosh. ""It was good,"" Wade said. ""That's one of my good friends and we was chilling last night with my daughter talking. I didn't tell him I was going to give him my jersey, but I thought it would be good. I gave Bron (LeBron James) my jersey in L.A. We all are what we are in this game because of each other as well so I thought it was great that I can give him a little piece of this last dance.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  With the Hawks' momentum gone and a noisy sellout crowd cheering the Timberwolves, first-year Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce made a bold prediction. ""I told our guys at the end of the third quarter, `This is going to be our best win of the season,"" Pierce said. It certainly wasn't their prettiest with 24 turnovers, but the Hawks made just enough hustle plays to overcome blowing a 22-point lead and beat Minnesota 123-120 in overtime Friday night. Kent Bazemore scored 23 points and John Collins added 21 to back up Pierce's boast. ""It definitely shows you he has confidence in what we're capable of,"" said Dewayne Dedmon, who made two big foul shots with 1.7 seconds left to preserve the win. ""Just hearing that made us just turn up a little bit and keep fighting."" Trae Young and Kevin Huerter each had big 3-pointers in the final minutes of overtime, and the Hawks earned their fifth road win despite matching their season high in turnovers. ""We're a young team and we like to play fast,"" Bazemore said. ""With all the inexperience out there and playing fast, it's kind of a bad combo for taking care of the ball. But, you know, Coach . doesn't tell guys to be less of themselves. He wants everyone to be aggressive."" The Timberwolves were done in by missed free throws, dunks and layups. After Huerter's 3 made it 121-117, Karl-Anthony Towns made two free throws before Andrew Wiggins went to the line for two shots with 4.5 seconds left. After missing two big free throws a few seconds earlier, Wiggins hit the first but missed his second. Dedmon hit his two foul shots with 1.7 seconds left. Rookie Josh Okogie pumped faked DeAndre Bembry and tried to draw contact from the corner, but his 3-point attempt fell short without a whistle. Bazemore sent it to overtime with a fast-break layup after stealing an inbounds pass with 20 seconds left to play. Justin Anderson blocked Derrick Rose's buzzer-beater attempt as time expired. MINNESOTA MISCUES The Wolves were out of sorts from the start; Wiggins forgot to put his jersey on underneath his warmups, and things went downhill in a hurry. Towns led the Wolves with 31 points and 19 rebounds. Robert Covington had 28 points but missed a dunk late in regulation and, in overtime, lost the ball on a wide-open layup underneath the basket. Young followed by hitting a 3 to give Atlanta a 118-117 lead with 1:49 to play. The Timberwolves erased a 22-point deficit after Atlanta silenced the home crowd early with a season-high 42 first-quarter points. The Wolves held the Hawks to 47 total over the next two quarters. ""We came out the second half and played with the edge we should have for all 48,"" Towns said. ""We put ourselves in that position. We dug ourselves out of a tremendous hole. We just didn't close it out."" Minnesota went 21 of 38 from the free throw line. ""It happens, ""Wiggins said. ""It's one of those days and one of those games."" WIGGINS' FREE-THROW WOES Wiggins, a career 74 percent free-throw shooter, was Minnesota's biggest offender from the stripe. He went 5 of 12 and heard frustrated boos from the home crowd. ""That's fans for you. We've got some (expletive) fans and we've got some good fans. That's just how it works,"" he said. ROSE UPDATE Rose scored 25 points but sprained his right ankle late. He started again for PG Jeff Teague, who missed his sixth straight game with inflammation in his left ankle. TALKING BASKETBALL Lynx star Rebekkah Brunson will be part of the Timberwolves' broadcast team this season. She'll do 10 upcoming games either as a second analyst during the game or work on the pregame show. Brunson's in-game debut will be on Jan. 2 when Minnesota visits Boston. Former Lynx player Lindsay Whalen did eight broadcasts last season. TIP-INS Hawks: Bazemore has scored 20 points in five of his last eight games. ... Alex Poythress scored 12 points in his third game since being called up from the G League. All of his points came in the first quarter. ... It was only the second time this season Atlanta has held a 20-point lead; the Hawks won the first game on Oct. 21 at Cleveland. Timberwolves: Rookie Keita Bates-Diop was active for the game for the first time since being recalled Dec. 22 from Iowa of the G League. ""He'll be back with us for a while now, and then when we have another opportunity to send him down we will. But he's coming along very nicely,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said.","401071198"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle called it ""breathtaking."" Anthony Davis called it just another day at the office, admittedly with a few extra deep breaths. Davis hit a go-ahead, fall-away jumper with 43.9 seconds left and scored a season-high 48 points to outduel rookie Luka Doncic and lift the New Orleans Pelicans over the Mavericks 114-112 on Friday night. ""It just feels good to get back in the win column,"" Davis said after playing a season-high 43 minutes, including all 24 in the second half, to carry the Pelicans (16-20) and halt a five-game losing streak. Davis was fouled on the shot and made the free throw for a two-point lead. Dallas got two more possessions, but Doncic had a layup blocked by Jrue Holiday, Dennis Smith Jr. missed a 3-pointer and the Mavericks couldn't get off a shot on a final possession with four seconds left. ""If he's not the MVP, he's going to be right there,"" Carlisle said of Davis. ""You double-team him and he finds people for open 3s, and then you have a hard time rebounding. The guy is a breathtaking talent. He's a great, great player."" Davis said he was proud of the ""hustle play"" by guard E'Twaun Moore that led to his go-ahead basket. Moore poked the ball free from Doncic, chased it down to the end line and saved it inbounds to Solomon Hill, who got the ball to Holiday, who finally found Davis on the wing. ""We take a lot of pride in the hustle points,"" Davis said. ""Alvin talks about us getting on the floor for 50-50 balls. Plays like that win you games."" Davis also grabbed 17 rebounds and the Pelicans held a 49-39 edge on the boards. New Orleans dominated in the paint, scoring 70 points, including 22 from Julius Randle. Doncic scored 34 points and hit 7 of 10 3-pointers, and Harrison Barnes had 21 points. Dallas set up for its final possession with Smith inbounding the ball. Smith got it back and drove into the lane against Davis, but his scoop shot did not beat the buzzer and fell off the rim anyway. Trailing 66-55 at the half, New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry lit into his team with what he said was ""not a G-rated speech."" Over the final 24 minutes, the Pelicans held the Mavericks (16-18) to 46 points on 40.5 percent shooting and forced nine turnovers. That made up for Dallas' barrage of perimeter shooting. The Mavs outgunned the Pelicans from long range, 15-4. ""It's hard to win a game when you get outscored by 33 from the 3-point line, but the way we played -- with 70 points in the paint -- that could kind of negate the 3-point thing,"" Gentry said. The Mavericks outscored the Pelicans from long range in the first half, cruising to a 66-55 lead by making 10 of 19 3-pointers while holding New Orleans to just 1 of 13 from behind the arc. Davis kept the Pelicans in the game with 22 first-half points on 9-of-15 shooting. Holiday had 14 first-half points, but seven of the Pelicans' other nine players had two or fewer points. New Orleans chipped away, outscoring Dallas 31-22 in the third quarter to pull within 88-86. The Pelicans took their first lead since late in the first quarter on a 3-pointer by Frank Jackson from the right baseline that put them up 99-96 with 7:43 left. J.J. Barea answered with a 3-pointer a few seconds later for Dallas. Davis made a 15-foot fadeaway over Jordan to tie it at 105 with 3:59 left, and his floating right-hand hook and 18-foot jumper on two of the Pelicans' next three possessions gave New Orleans a 111-109 lead. TIP-INS Mavericks: Smith returned after missing 11 games with a right wrist sprain. It was his first start since Dec. 13. ... The Mavs are in a stretch in which they will play 14 games in 25 days in four time zones. Pelicans: New Orleans inserted F Darius Miller into the starting lineup for perimeter shooting help.

"DENVER --  Jamal Murray and the Denver Nuggets keep right on rolling. Not just ankles, either. Murray scored 31 points despite turning his right ankle late in the fourth quarter, Monte Morris hit two big free throws with 7.2 seconds remaining and the Nuggets held off the San Antonio Spurs 102-99 on Friday night to extend their home winning streak to eight. After the game, Murray eased into his dress shoe, wincing in pain. ""Feeling great,"" he said. ""Feeling sensational."" Murray wasn't the only one to land wrong. Malik Beasley had 21 points, but rolled his left ankle on a drive in the fourth quarter. He made two free throws before exiting. ""I'll be good. I'm a mutant,"" Beasley pronounced. ""I'll be all right."" Nikola Jokic added 21 points, nine rebounds and nine assists before fouling out as the Nuggets nearly squandered an 18-point, first-half lead. Bryn Forbes had a 3-point look to tie the game in the final second but couldn't get it launched in time over Trey Lyles. ""We try to show our guys what we think they're going to run, to give them an awareness,"" coach Michael Malone said. Just then, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich walked by and playfully lobbed in his thoughts. ""Love you, too,"" Malone cracked as Popovich continued down the hallway. LaMarcus Aldridge finished with 24 points for San Antonio, while DeMar DeRozan added 15. The Spurs, the top free throw shooting team in the league, went 4 of 8 from the line over the final 1:48. They were 11 of 20 for the game. ""None of us go out there and miss free throws,"" DeRozan said. ""We've been great all year. We gave ourselves countless opportunities to be able to take the lead, tie the game up and give ourselves a great chance to win."" It was the second game of a home-and-home between the teams. The Spurs won 111-103 in San Antonio on Wednesday. In that game, DeRozan and Aldridge combined for 57 points. ""They're a good team over there. They play well together, they move the ball, so we had to take some things away,"" Aldridge said. The Nuggets remained percentage points ahead of Golden State for the top mark in the Western Conference despite missing starters Paul Millsap, Will Barton and Gary Harris due to injuries. San Antonio turned up the defense in the second half to climb back into the game. Trailing 100-98 with 28 seconds remaining, Derrick White made one of two free throws. Morris then was fouled on a drive to the basket and made both. Morris finished with seven points, five rebounds and seven assists. ""The littlest guy on the floor, least experienced guy on the floor coming up in big, big ways time and time again,"" Malone said. TIP-INS Spurs: F/C Pau Gasol (right foot) made the trip with the team and is getting closer to a return. ... Popovich called a timeout just 46 seconds into the game. Nuggets: Harris (right hip) and Millsap (fractured right big toe) are nearing a return. ... Mason Plumlee had 13 rebounds. HOMECOMING White grew up in the area and played a season at the University of Colorado. He's gone from sporadically playing for the Spurs last season -- he also helped the Austin Spurs win the 2018 G League championship -- to becoming their starting guard. White had 10 points on Friday. ""He's just a young man who's gaining confidence day by day,"" Popovich said. ""Just believing he belongs is really the important thing for him."" DIFFERENT STRATEGY Jokic drew a crowd, but kept finding the open player before fouling out with 1:33 left. That was a departure from Wednesday when he was held to four points. ""It's like a playoff series where you make adjustments,"" Murray said. ""We made some key adjustments to give him some space to work."" MURRAY'S DETERMINATION Seeing Murray in pain after turning his ankle, Malone was going to send in Morris. ""I saw him running toward the corner, like he was going to the tunnel,"" Malone said. ""He pulled a Willis Reed on us and did a U-turn and came back on the court."" Murray said there was never a doubt he would keep playing.","401071200"
"PHOENIX --  For three quarters on Friday night, the improving Phoenix Suns gave Oklahoma City everything it could handle. Russell Westbrook and Dennis Schroder took over from there, and the Thunder rolled to a 118-102 victory. Westbrook scored 40 points, 15 in the game's final 6  1/2 minutes, Schroder scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and Oklahoma City snapped a two-game skid despite the absence of Paul George, who missed his first game of the season due to a right quad contusion. Abdel Nader scored a career-high 18 for the Thunder. When the game was on the line, Thunder coach Billy Donovan said, ""We defended really well, we rebounded really well and we took care of the basketball and were able to score points."" Devin Booker had 25 points and 10 assists for the Suns, who had a three-point lead after three quarters but were outscored 37-18 in the fourth. ""We lean on defense all season,"" Westbrook said, ""and it's important that we constantly keep leaning on that to win games."" T.J. Warren scored 19 and Deandre Ayton 16 for Phoenix, which had won five of its previous seven games after opening the season 4-24. ""That's a very winnable game for us,"" Booker said. ""We just let it slip. That team's been together a long time. They know what it takes to close out games. We're still learning."" The Thunder swept the four-game season series from the Suns. Schroder scored 10, including a pair of 3s, in what proved to be the decisive 17-2 fourth-quarter run that put Oklahoma City ahead 102-88 with 6:09 to play. Westbrook capped the outburst with a 3 and pretty much took over the game from there. ""In the first half, my shot wasn't falling and everybody else stepped up doing a great job,"" Schroder said. ""In the second half, everybody gave me confidence, told me to keep shooting and I did and in the fourth quarter I kept it going, shot every shot I could get and it went in."" The Suns' reserves were the main contributors in a 16-4 second-quarter run. Nader converted a three-point play then scored again inside to put the Thunder up 43-35 with 10:02 left in the first half. But Josh Jackson sank a 19-footer, followed by a 3-pointer, to ignite the surge. Booker also hit a 3-pointer and Mikal Bridges scored from the baseline to put the Suns ahead 51-47 with 5:22 to go. There were five lead changes the rest of the half, with Oklahoma City leading 58-57 at the break. Phoenix scored the first six points of the second half to lead 63-55 and was up 82-77 after Warren's 3-pointer, but Raymond Felton's steal and layup cut it to 82-79. The Suns led 84-81 entering the fourth. ""We can be pleased with the three quarters that we played and how we played, how we competed,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said, ""but unfortunately it's a 48-minute game.""

"Montrezl Harrell loved hearing the boos from Lakers fans and wants everyone to remember there are two teams in Los Angeles. (0:42) LOS ANGELES --  Even while playing without LeBron James on the tail end of a back-to-back set, the Los Angeles Lakers managed to carve out a double-digit lead in the third quarter against the Los Angeles Clippers. That's when the Clippers' four toughest defenders clamped down and Sweet Lou went wild to win this basketball-loving city's first rivalry game of the season. Lou Williams had a season-high 36 points and the Clippers scored 22 consecutive points during the second half of a 118-107 victory over the depleted Lakers on Friday night. Danilo Gallinari added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, who held the Lakers without a field goal for more than six minutes while matching the longest unanswered scoring run by any team in the NBA this season. ""We were just a little sluggish,"" Williams said. ""We were just a step slow. We knew they were on a back-to-back, but for whatever reason, we just weren't playing our best until we put a good stretch together in the third and then busted the game wide open in the fourth."" Although both LA franchises are still building chemistry after major roster changes in 2018, the Clippers found a groove to get it done in front of the Lakers' jeering home fans. They showed some style, too: After Williams punctuated a decisive 3-pointer by mimicking Lakers guard Lance Stephenson's air guitar celebration of big shots, Montrezl Harrell grinningly waved on the boos in the final minute. The Clippers turned a seven-point deficit into a 15-point lead early in the fourth quarter of their fourth win in five games. Williams torched his former team yet again, scoring 23 points in the second half, yet the game turned with the suffocating defense played by Patrick Beverley, Harrell, Avery Bradley and Sindarius Thornwell during that 22-0 run. ""We put the bulldogs on the floor, and the fight was amazing,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Williams hit three 3-pointers, including a decisive shot with 2:23 to play, and the skinny 6-foot-1 guard even grabbed seven rebounds while making all 11 of his free throws. ""Lou has seen pretty much every defense you can throw at him,"" Rivers said. ""He's a professional scorer."" Kyle Kuzma scored 24 points and Lonzo Ball had 19 for the Lakers, who played without James, Rajon Rondo and JaVale McGee. The remaining Lakers lost for the fifth time in seven games, following up their surprising win at Golden State on Christmas Day with just their third back-to-back defeats since October. James watched from the bench in street clothes after causing a pregame stir on social media when he entered the Lakers' locker room holding a glass of wine. The noted oenophile and four-time NBA MVP is day-to-day with his strained groin, but James isn't expected to miss as much time as Rondo, who is out for at least a month after surgery on his right index finger. ""I know we can get through it,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""I know it's not going to be easy, but I believe in the guys that we have. We've just got to do a couple of things a little bit better."" One night after losing at Sacramento on a buzzer-beating 3, the Lakers again couldn't win without three veteran regulars. Ingram and Ball both picked up four fouls during the third quarter, but neither team made a big move until the Clippers scored the final nine points of the quarter and continued their one-sided run well into the fourth. ""A lot of us ran out of gas right there,"" Kuzma said. ""When we're tired physically, our mental aspect has to be better."" TIP-INS Clippers: Williams hit a 3-pointer from just past halfcourt at the halftime buzzer. ... They have won four straight ""road"" games against the Lakers, but lost their last ""home"" game in the series. Lakers: They showed why they're the NBA's worst team at the line by missing more free throws in the first quarter (7) than the Pistons, Pacers, Bulls, Wizards, Raptors, Magic, Hornets, Nets, Heat, Cavaliers and Pelicans missed in their entire games Friday. ... Michael Beasley is still away from the team after his mother's death. A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE The Clippers have won 22 of their last 25 meetings with the Lakers, yet still trail the 16-time NBA champions 146-70 in the overall series. This is still an exciting time for hoops in LA: The Lakers (20-16) have been revitalized around James, while the Clippers (21-14) have formed a surprisingly strong core after shedding longtime mainstays Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and Chris Paul over the previous year. T'D UP Josh Hart scored 12 points for the Lakers before getting ejected with 4:41 left after he was infuriated that Tobias Harris wasn't called for pushing off. Walton also got a technical foul in the exchange.","401071202"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo got turned away early but made the clutch plays late. One of the NBA's most dynamic dunkers shook off a rare rejection and helped the Milwaukee Bucks turn away Brooklyn's attempt to rally from a 23-point deficit in a 129-115 win over the undermanned Nets on Saturday. Antetokounmpo had his third triple-double of the season with 31 points , 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while Khris Middleton scored 29 points, despite a quad injury. The Bucks, who have won three straight and seven of eight, extended their NBA-best record to 25-10. They nearly squandered their big lead after the Nets went on a 14-0 run in the fourth, and Shabazz Napier's 7-footer with 4:51 left trimmed the deficit to seven. ""I think there was a pretty major lapse, the start of the fourth quarter,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Middleton and Antetokounmpo, the Bucks' two best players, reasserted control. After a bucket by Middleton, Antetokounmpo scored six straight and also drew a charge on former teammate Jared Dudley in a 57-second span of the fourth that ended with the Bucks rebuilding a 15-point lead with 3:10 left. The Bucks were back on their way to their third straight win and seventh in eight games. ""He was phenomenal in the last five minutes,"" Budenholzer said. But a 6-foot-11 forward known for making highlight reels drew social media buzz after a dunk attempt in the first quarter was blocked by Nets center Jarrett Allen. Leave it to Antetokounmpo to finish strong. ""That's what a superstar does. When it's crunch time, when it's time to close a game out -- he did it,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Napier tied his career high with 32 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the field and 10 of 12 from the foul line. Kenneth Faried had 21 points and 10 rebounds. Milwaukee's Brook Lopez added 24 points on 7-of-15 shooting from the 3-point arc. Lopez provided balance from the perimeter, especially after hitting 5 of 9 from the arc in the first half to help open up a 19-point halftime lead. The 7-foot center has become quite a long-range threat since he started shooting 3s with more frequency while with the Nets two seasons ago under Atkinson's tutelage. Atkinson was forced to come up with a plan on Saturday to slow down the league's highest-scoring team despite missing six players going into the contest because of injuries or rest. Brooklyn then lost forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson with a right groin injury in the first quarter. TIP INS Nets: Brooklyn missed out on its last chance for a 10th win in December, which would have given the team its winningest December since going 10-4 in 2005. ... The bench celebrated after Allen rejected Antetokounmpo in the first, with one reserve wagging an index finger in the air side to side. Antetokounmpo got some revenge after two dunks in transition later in the quarter. Bucks: Leading 71-52 at the half, the Bucks fell a point short of their highest-scoring first half of the season. ... The team entered the day at 14 games over .500, Milwaukee's best record since finishing the 2000-01 season 52-30. ... Middleton played 35 minutes after being listed as questionable with the right quad injury sustained late in the Thursday's win over the New York Knicks. OVERCOMING INJURIES The Nets' comeback was impressive given the roster limitations. Their three highest scorers all came off the bench: Napier, Faried and DeMarre Carroll, who had 18 points. ""That's the spirit of the group,"" Atkinson said. ""It's kind of known throughout the league that this team doesn't quit, keeps competing until the end."" QUOTABLE ""Once we started getting going, the ball was really popping a lot and moving around well ... We were having fun out there."" -- Lopez on the team's 21 of 51 (41 percent) from the 3-point line. NOTABLE The Bucks won their NBA-best 17th game by 10 or more points. ... Carroll tied a season high by going 4 of 7 from the 3-point line.","401071203"
"WASHINGTON --  The Washington Wizards will need more of the balance they displayed on Saturday night if they hope to make the playoffs without injured All-Star guard John Wall. Trevor Ariza scored 24 points and was one of seven Washington players in double figures as the Wizards defeated the Charlotte Hornets 130-126 amid news that Wall will have season-ending surgery. ""Of course losing John is huge for this team -- he's the head of the snake,"" Ariza said. ""But when something like that happens, you have to find ways to win. That's why you have what we call a team."" Thomas Bryant added 21 points and 10 rebounds and Ariza had nine assists and seven rebounds. Despite allowing Hornets guard Kemba Walker to score 47 points, Washington won for just the third time in 12 games after announcing Wall would undergo a procedure to address bone spurs in his left heel and miss at least six months. The Wizards also overcame an uncharacteristic 7-of-19 shooting from leading scorer Bradley Beal, who finished with 19 points. Tomas Satoransky added 20 on a night rookie Troy Brown Jr. was the only Wizards player not to reach double figures. ""I can't sit here and try to do it all on my own,"" Beal said. ""There's no way .. I'll be able to do it on my own. And it's just a matter of trusting my teammates no matter what it looks like. We've got to get the win."" Walker scored 24 of his points in the fourth quarter and nearly lifted Charlotte to a remarkable comeback when his 3-pointer cut the lead to a point with 1.9 seconds to play. Nicolas Batum added 17 points for the Hornets, who fell to 4-11 on the road and are facing a six-game West Coast road trip early in January. Charlotte has allowed at least 130 points in consecutive road contests. ""It wasn't enough offense,"" Walker said. ""The defense is usually what gets teams over the top. It gets us over the top. That's when we're at our best ... tonight it wasn't it."" The Wizards went 20-21 last season without Wall, who missed many of those games while recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. They're still nine games below .500 (14-23) this season, despite Saturday's victory. The Hornets led only once after halftime, when Walker's jumper made it 105-103. However, Washington nearly squandered a 125-116 lead inside the final 25 seconds. Walker sank a technical free throw assessed to Beal, and Cody Zeller hit two more. Then, Walker hit two more jumpers, one following a turnover and the next off a pair of missed free throws by Satoransky. He then hit a 3 from the left wing to cut it to 127-126. On the ensuing inbounds, Jeff Green found Ariza on a full-court feed. Ariza was fouled by Walker and converted a three-point play to seal it. ""We found a way to score the basketball,"" Ariza said. ""We played together, we moved the ball, so we got a lot of people a lot of open shots."" FORTY FEAT Saturday marked Walker's fourth time scoring 40 or more this season, after posting career-high five 40-plus point performances in the 2017-18 campaign. He now has 13 such games for his career. LOST JOHN The decision for Wall to have surgery came after visiting with Green Bay Packers associate team physician Dr. Robert Anderson on Saturday. Wall had yet to address the surgical option publicly before to the game, although he walked through the Wizards' locker room Saturday night with a gray protective boot on his left foot. TIP-INS Hornets: G Tony Parker did not travel with the team on a planned off day. ... Michael Kidd-Gilchrist's put-back at the buzzer gave Charlotte a 29-27 lead at the end of the first quarter. Wizards: F Markieff Morris will see a specialist about his continuing upper back and neck stiffness sometime next week, coach Scott Brooks said. . F Otto Porter Jr. (right knee) has been cleared to play, but Brooks wanted him to return to full practice first, rather than returning for the second of back-to-back games on Saturday. . Sam Dekker had 13 points off the bench after hitting his first six shots.","401071204"
"NEW ORLEANS --  James Harden is on a run the NBA hasn't seen since Oscar Robertson. Harden had 41 points and six assists to become the first player since the Hall of Fame guard to record at least 35 points and five assists in seven consecutive games, and the Houston Rockets beat the New Orleans Pelicans 108-104 on Saturday night. ""That's what I play for,"" Harden said when asked about being compared to the Big O. ""That's what you play the game of basketball for, to be mentioned in the name with the greats. Obviously, I have a long way to go, but that's what I put my jersey on for, that's what I lace my shoes up for, to go out there and be the best that I can be and when it's all said and done, be mentioned as one of the best basketball players to ever touch a basketball."" Harden had 26 points in the first half and reached 40 for the third straight game. He was 7 for 16 from 3-point range and made all 14 free throws. He regularly juked Pelican defenders off their feet to draw fouls, including two fouls from behind the arc for another easy six points. ""I've said it a thousand times -- and I don't think I'm wrong because I get to watch it every night -- but you don't get better than what he does offensively,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""No one's better. Then he's also coming up with steals and rebounds. I mean, he does a lot. I think people sometimes are just trying to look to find holes in his game -- and I think everybody has a little something. He doesn't make every shot."" Anthony Davis looked sluggish a night after scoring a season-high 48 points in a victory over Dallas, taking only five shots in the first half and finishing with 22 points. Julius Randle led the Pelicans with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Houston led 77-76 after three and scored the first seven points of the fourth period, five coming from Danuel House Jr. on a reverse layup and an open 3-pointer. The Rockets extended their lead to 101-86 with 5:57 left, but the Pelicans went on a 13-2 run, with Davis scoring six, to cut the deficit to 103-99. With the Rockets leading 104-101 with 12.6 seconds left, P.J. Tucker, a 56 percent free throw shooter, made both foul shots to ice the victory. Harden torched the Pelicans for 17 points in the first quarter and added nine more in the second as Houston took a 53-50 halftime lead. Harden's 26 first-half points were more than half of the Rockets' scoring. The next closest teammate in scoring was Austin Rivers with eight. ""I thought we did a really good job defensively,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We say that, and Harden gets (41), but that doesn't bother us because we knew that that was a possibility. I thought we did a good job everywhere else, but we just didn't quite get over the hump with making a few plays down the stretch."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon, who scored 21, including 16 in the second half, limped through the fourth quarter with a sore right knee. ""I'll know more tomorrow,"" Gordon said. . D'Antoni said Harden's extra workout regimen is paying dividends nearly halfway through the grind of the regular season. ""It doesn't wear him out, it gives him energy,"" D'Antoni said. ""Obviously, it's paying off."" ... C Clint Capela has averaged 15.0 rebounds in the last nine games. Pelicans: F Darius Miller, held scoreless in a Friday night victory over Dallas, missed the game due to an illness. Solomon Hill started in his place. ... Gentry called Harden ""the best `iso' player in the world. I don't know if anybody is better in the history of this league, really, as far as drawing fouls and making plays in `iso' situations.."" ... Despite three separate losing streaks of four, five and six games, Gentry says his players have not ""lost faith that we're going to be a good team.""","401071205"
"ATLANTA --  There hasn't been much for Hawks forward John Collins to feel good about this season. His team has almost no chance to make the playoffs, so Collins wants to enjoy the good times while they last. ""We're a young team with a new coaching staff,"" he said. ""It's all about getting together as a group and figuring it out. I think we have been."" Trae Young and Vince Carter each scored 21 points, Collins added 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Atlanta beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 111-108 on Saturday night. Carter, 41, had his first game with 20 points for Atlanta and became the oldest player in history to lead or tie for the team lead in scoring. He looked half his age with a baseline dunk midway through the fourth and then hit a corner 3 that made it 98-92 a couple of minutes later. ""More than anything, I wanted to bring the energy,"" Carter said. ""I'm not the youngest guy, but I want to play the hardest."" Atlanta, enjoying a rare run of success in its first season of rebuilding under new coach Lloyd Pierce, has won five of six. At 11-24, the Hawks have the fourth-worst mark in the Eastern Conference, but they've done better recently compared to Cleveland, which dropped its sixth in a row. Cedi Osman finished with 22 points, and Larry Nance Jr. and Collin Sexton each had 18 for the Cavs. Cleveland fell to 8-29, worst in the NBA. The Cavs never led after Jaron Blossomgame's alley-oop dunk made it a three-point game midway through the third. They trailed by 12 late in the third, but Sexton's free throw tied it at 106-all with 58 seconds remaining. After Collins scored on a follow shot, Alec Burks made an errant inbound pass to Nance that Justin Anderson stole and handed to Young. ""We just didn't set our screens, and they did a good job of denying us,"" Osman said. ""Everything just happened really fast, and we lost the ball, but that was just another of our simple mistakes."" Young missed a 3-pointer, but DeAndre' Bembry was fouled on a rebound and hit a free throw to make it a three-point game. Cleveland blew its last chance to score when Jordan Clarkson missed a 3 in the closing seconds. ""We are going to keep fighting,"" Cavs coach Larry Drew said. ""I don't think we put ourselves in a position for it to be a better result at the end of the game and we just didn't make plays down the stretch and missed some free throws."" Trailing by 10 in the last 2 minutes of the first, Atlanta tied it at 28-all on Young's straightaway 3 and took its first lead on Alex Len's inside basket early in the second. Len took passes from Young and Kent Bazemore to score at the rim on consecutive possessions that put the Hawks up 47-41, and the lead jumped to 12 on 3s by Jeremy Lin and Kevin Huerter. EARLY NIGHT Bazemore limped off the floor with a right ankle sprain midway through the third and did not return. Working to get open, Bazemore drew a foul as he fell backward into Osman. He made one of two free throws before heading straight to the locker room and finished with five points and five rebounds in 20 minutes. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Drew had only nine healthy players for the second straight night. ... Ante Zizic was a late scratch with right knee soreness. ... G Rodney Hood missed his fourth straight game with a left Achilles tendon soreness. ... Nance appeared to have a leg injury late in the game but he stayed in. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Kyrie Irving didn't get off to a very good start, so he and the Boston Celtics made sure to finish with a flurry. Irving scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half, Al Horford converted a pair of late 3-pointers to finish with 18 points and the Celtics erased a 19-point, second-half deficit to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 112-103 on Saturday night. ""At the half, Kyrie just challenged all of us to be better,"" Horford said of the difference after Boston trailed 64-47 at intermission. ""The coach as well. I felt like we came out with better energy, played much harder."" Irving's halftime talk had to deal with his own game as well. He was limited to four shots in the first half and four points. That approach changed in the second half as Irving became more aggressive and got to the basket more often. ""Offensively, I felt like they were trying to take the ball out of my hands,"" Irving said, adding the Celtics were more active off the ball in the second half. ""You don't have to touch the basketball every single play down to be effective. You can be effective doing the little things. That's what we did in the second half."" But there still was the matter of overcoming the 19-point deficit in the third quarter. Boston started it with an 11-2 run in the closing minutes of the third. Then, Memphis opened the fourth missing 15 of its first 16 shots. By that point, Boston had overtaken the Grizzlies. Memphis would hold a 97-96 lead before the Celtics rattled off a 12-4 rally that included a pair of 3-pointers from Horford to collect the win. ""We didn't do a good job of defending the 3-point line,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said after Boston was 9 of 18 behind the arc in the second half. ""We allowed them to shoot 44 percent from the 3-point line (for the game), and that was the difference."" Marcus Morris scored 22 points for Boston, and Gordon Hayward had 14 off the bench. Mike Conley led Memphis with 26 points, while Dillon Brooks added 19. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Marc Gasol finished with 15 points apiece. ""We couldn't get stops,"" Gasol said. ""Normally, the way you stop the bleeding is by getting stops, and we couldn't get stops. .And it felt like they made every shot down the stretch."" TIP-INS Celtics: Rookie F Robert Williams missed his second straight game with a left groin strain. ... Horford's five 3-pointers matched his career high set against Houston on Dec. 29, 2015. . Irving's 13 assists matched his season best and was one short of his career high. Grizzlies: Gasol has made a 3-pointer in 12 straight games, one short of his career-best 13 in December 2017. ... Brooks was 4 of 5 from outside the arc. ... Gasol had 10 assists, marking the center's 13th double-double of the season. . Memphis was 24 for 37 in the first half (64.9 percent), a season-best shooting percentage for a half. DEFENDING CONLEY Bickerstaff doesn't think Conley gets the respect from officials that his point guard deserves. Bickerstaff pointed to a play where he believed Conley was slapped on the arm on a drive to the basket. Bickerstaff said it was a game-changer, calling it a ""huge missed call."" ""I think it's been a running theme in the conversations that we've had about the fouls that Mike Conley gets that aren't blown. Mike Conley is one of the class acts in the NBA. He serves the respect of the officials. Time and time again, he drives to the basket, there's contact made, but there's no whistle. . He doesn't get the respect that I feel that some of these other guys at his level do."" FATIGUE SETS IN Celtics second-year forward Guerschon Yabusele played a season-high 16 minutes, including significant minutes in the fourth before Horford returned with 4:47 left in the game. ""I'm not going to lie, I'm really, really tired,"" he said.","401071207"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Dante Exum made the most of his first start of the season. Exum, a fifth-year guard filling in for usual starter Ricky Fubio, seized control of the Utah Jazz offense and had 13 points and a career-high 13 assists in a 129-97 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday. Exum made sure the Jazz didn't skip a beat without Rubio, who sat out with lower back and left knee contusions. He made the right reads on nearly every possession and routinely executed crisp passes to set up easy baskets. ""Guys that are willing to be unselfish want to make players around them better,"" Exum said after his first career double-double. ""That's something I try to do when I'm out on the court, get guys involved."" Rudy Gobert ended up as the biggest benefactor from Exum's passing. Gobert had a team-high 25 points on 10-of-12 shooting and grabbed 16 rebounds for his 31st double-double of the season. Gobert figured he would have a good connection with Exum, especially after he threw down a dunk off a lob pass for his first basket. ""I always love to play with Dante,"" Gobert said. ""He's a very good passer and tonight he was great. Really gave us the spark we needed during the game."" Utah quickly took control of the game behind that Exum-Gobert connection, hitting its first six baskets in the paint and scoring 24 points in the paint by the end of the first quarter. Gobert led the way, scoring 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting in the period. Gobert's last three baskets in the quarter were part of a 17-5 run that pushed Utah to a double-digit lead. Kyle Korver punctuated the run with a 3-pointer from the corner that put the Jazz up 30-14. Utah didn't let up in the second quarter. The Jazz used a 14-2 run to take a 60-26 lead with 2:26 left before halftime. They eventually built a 40-point lead before the break, going up 71-31 on a layup by Mitchell with 4.6 seconds left in the quarter. ""They was getting downhill on most every possession,"" Knicks guard Emmanuel Mudiay said. ""They didn't feel us enough."" Mitchell added 15 points and Korver chipped in 15 off the bench for the Jazz, who won for the sixth time in seven home games. The Jazz outscored New York 70-26 in the paint, matching a franchise record for points in the paint, and finished with a 60-35 rebounding advantage. The 60 rebounds were a season-high for Utah. ""We did a good job in our execution early in the game,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I thought we came out and did an excellent job on the defensive glass and our guards made good decisions."" Tim Hardaway, Jr. scored 18 points and Luke Kornet added 14 in his second start for the Knicks. New York lost its seventh straight. The Knicks have one win in their last 13 games overall. New York trimmed the deficit to 82-60 on a 3-pointer by Hardaway late in the third quarter. But, that's as close as the Knicks got in the second half. Utah answered with a 15-3 run, punctuated by baskets from Raul Neto and Royce O'Neale, for a 97-63 lead in the final minute of the third quarter. ""They came out with force and we came out dead,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""We had no legs, no life -- nothing. We couldn't make shots. We couldn't get stops. It was just a total avalanche."" KANTER UNHAPPY Enes Kanter came off the bench for the second straight game and isn't pleased about his suddenly reduced role with the Knicks. Kanter played just 17 minutes and finished with zero points on 0-of-6 shooting to go along with four rebounds and three assists. He played just 14 minutes against Milwaukee on Thursday and finished with eight points and five rebounds. Kornet took over Kanter's spot in the starting lineup earlier in the week. He has averaged 18.5 points on 46 percent shooting in two games since the switch, while playing 31.0 minutes per contest. ""I don't why they're shutting me down,"" Kanter said. ""I just want to go out there and play basketball and win. It doesn't matter whether I start or come off the bench, it every player's job to go out there and fight every minute. I'm trying to stay positive, but I just don't understand what the situation is. I don't know why they're shutting me down this early."" FIRST HALF FEAT Gobert tallied 24 points and 12 boards during the first half alone after turning repeated feeds from Exum into mostly uncontested dunks and layups. It marked the first time that a Jazz player totaled at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in any half since Carlos Boozer did it against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 9, 2010.

"PHOENIX --  There was no getting around the pain in his right ankle, so Jamal Murray figured out a way to deal with the injury. ""I was trying not to move as much, kind of relied on my shot,"" Murray said. He's rarely shot it better than he did Saturday night. Murray scored 46 points and made a career-high nine 3-pointers, carrying the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets to a 122-118 victory over the Phoenix Suns, the adrenaline from a big night helping him deal with the ankle. Murray was 16 for 24 from the field with the second-most points he's scored in a game this season. He scored 31 a night earlier in a win over San Antonio. The Suns almost overcame a 22-point, fourth-quarter deficit, drawing to 113-110 on Mikal Bridges' 3-pointer with 1:51 to play. T.J. Warren hit a 3 to cut the lead to 117-113 with 30 seconds remaining, but the Nuggets closed it out with free throws in the final seconds. Nikola Jokic added 23 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for Denver, while Malik Beasley came off the bench to hit a career-high five 3-pointers for his 15 points. ""He's my security blanket,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said of Jokic. ""At the end of the game, when the ball goes to him I know something good is going to happen."" Rookie Deandre Ayton scored a season-high 33 points and added 14 rebounds for the Suns. Ayton made 12-of-13 shots in the second quarter for 24 points, the highest-scoring quarter by a Suns rookie and sixth-highest by any Sun in franchise history. ""I don't think I started off playing well,"" Ayton said. ""Coach took me out and I got my second wind and went out and forgot about the scoreboard and just played hard."" Denver improved to 4-1 in the second of back-to-back games this season. The Nuggets made a season-high 18 3s for the second straight night. Phoenix, the last-place team in the West, is 0-6 on the second night of back-to-backs this season and has lost four of its last five overall. Suns star Devin Booker bruised his lower back in the second quarter after he stepped in to draw a charge on the Nuggets' Torrey Craig. Though announced as questionable for the second half, he returned and scored 27 points for the game, 20 in the second half. ""We were worried if he could finish the game and be on the court,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""He was fighting through pain and he was leading the group when we needed him the most."" Murray started hot, knocking down his first three 3s and finishing the first quarter with 13 points. He had 15 in the fourth. Murray lobbed to Mason Plumlee for a dunk with 2:39 left in the first half, giving Denver a 57-37 lead. The Suns went on a 12-2 run to cut the lead to 59-49, but Juancho Hernangomez hit a 3 just before the halftime buzzer for Denver. The Nuggets made 11 3s in the first half. Denver led by as many as 23 in the third quarter, but Ayton's hook with 19 seconds got the Suns within 90-78. Denver scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter, but the Suns stormed back to make it interesting at the end. EXCHANGE OF THOUGHTS As the Suns rallied in the fourth quarter, a fan yelled from the stands at Kokoskov. ""Hey Igor, we can make some free throws!"" the fan shouted. Kokoskov looked at him, pointed and said, ""You're right!"" The Suns made nine of 14 for the game. TIP-INS Nuggets: F Paul Millsap returned to action after missing the past eight games with a broken right big toe. He played 14 minutes. ""We'll see at altitude, I think that's going to be the big challenge,"" Millsap said about getting back into game shape. ... Beasley played through a sprained left ankle. ... Five other Nuggets players were inactive, including G Will Barton (hip/core surgery) and G Gary Harris (right hip).

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A road game for the Golden State Warriors felt a little like home for Klay Thompson. Perhaps that helped him shoot his way out of a slump. Thompson, who grew up in Portland as the son of former Trail Blazer Mychal Thompson, scored 32 points Saturday night to lead Golden State to a 115-105 victory. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant each had 25 points as Golden State evened the score after losing at home to Portland 110-109 on Thursday. Thompson broke out by hitting 12 of 21 shots, going 4 of 5 from 3-point range. At one point after making a 3-pointer, Thompson began talking to his right hand. What did Thompson say? ""I missed you. It's good to see you again,"" Thompson said. ""It's been a five-game absence or so where he hasn't been in the game, so to finally see the ball go in at a high rate felt really good."" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said there wasn't anything different about Thompson's game. He was merely due. ""Shots just went in,"" Kerr said. ""I didn't think the quality of his shot attempts looked that much better. I think the law of averages just took over."" If there's a place outside Oakland where Thompson feels most comfortable, it's Portland's Moda Center, known as the Rose Garden during his childhood. ""It's like a second home here. I was very fortunate to come to a lot of Blazer games at the Rose Garden,"" Thompson said. ""To be back here playing for my family is surreal. It feels like I'm getting old. It feels like yesterday I was back in these hallways trying to snag autographs. It's always a pleasure to come back here."" Damian Lillard hit six 3-pointers and scored 40 points. It was the fifth time this season Lillard, who made the go-ahead 3-pointer in the victory at Oracle Arena, has scored at least 40 points. Golden State avenged that loss with improved shooting and better defense. The Warriors shot 50 percent from the floor (40 of 80), and made 12 of 25 from 3-point range. Durant was 10 of 19 from the floor, while Kevin Looney was 5 of 6, and made his first 3-pointer of the season. Kerr said it made a difference on defense to expand his rotation to 11 players Saturday. ""I didn't like what I did the other night, playing eight guys,"" Kerr said. ""I thought everybody who stepped on the floor did a really good job for us."" Jusuf Nurkic finished with 21 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for the Blazers. Leading 30-27 after one quarter, Golden State scored the first 10 points of the second, including seven consecutive by Curry. Golden State led by as many as 17 points during the first half, settling for a 58-50 halftime lead. But the Warriors lost Andre Iguodala at halftime after he was ejected for hurling the ball deep into the end zone seats at the buzzer. Though Lillard scored 20 points during the third quarter, Golden State increased its lead to 93-83. The Warriors led by as many as 18 points in the fourth before holding off a late Portland rally. ""We kept battling. I thought we made some good comebacks, but in the end, we let our guard down a few times. When you let your guard down, they take advantage of it,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State, 6 of 15 from the free throw line during Thursday's game, made its first 10 Saturday, and went 23 of 28 overall. ... The Warriors had three technical fouls in the game, including one on Durant for hanging on the rim. Trail Blazers: Lillard's fifth 40-point game this season ties a career high. He also scored 40 points five times during the 2016-17 season. MISFIRED SHOT After Iguodala's heave into the stands at the end of the first half, officials spent more than a minute at a courtside monitor before deeming his throw a ""hostile act,"" warranting an ejection. ""Andre said he was just shooting the ball,"" Kerr said. ""It wasn't a very good shot. Went a little long.""","401071210"
"LOS ANGELES --  The consistency that has been a staple of the San Antonio Spurs under coach Gregg Popovich eluded them to start this season. The Spurs seem to have rediscovered it, especially in the second half of games, as the Los Angeles Clippers found out during a dominant third quarter. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 38 points and the Spurs beat the Clippers 122-111 on Saturday night. DeMar DeRozan had 25 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for the Spurs, who won for the fifth time in their past seven games. ""It's understanding our mistakes,"" DeRozan said. ""Understanding we got to come out the second half with that intensity. We do it at home, but trying to generate our home energy on the road, trying to be more conscious of that."" Coming out of the locker room with the game tied at 56, the Spurs outscored the Clippers 39-19 in the third quarter. Defense fueled offense as San Antonio turned six Los Angeles turnovers into 12 points and had a 14-0 edge in fast-break points. ""Our confidence is definitely showing (offensively) once we go out there and play defense like we know how to do it,"" said DeRozan, who scored nine points in the quarter. Los Angeles trailed by as many as 24 in the fourth quarter before cutting the margin, but never seriously threatened San Antonio after halftime. It was the second straight win by San Antonio over Los Angeles. The Spurs' 125-87 victory at home on Dec. 13 is their largest margin of victory this season. ""It felt like they had more energy, they were far more physical than us,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I think the last two times we have played them they have been the more physical team. We just have to go look at it and see what we didn't do right, and it was a lot."" Rudy Gay had 12 points, and San Antonio's starters combined for 97 points with all five in double figures. Danilo Gallinari had 21 points and nine rebounds for the Clippers, who had won three straight at home. Montrezl Harrell scored 21 points and Lou Williams had 16 points and seven assists off the bench. TIP-INS Spurs: Bryn Forbes had 10 points and seven assists. ... Marco Belinelli had 11 points, but the Spurs were outscored 55-25 in bench production. ... F Pau Gasol was active for the second straight night but did not play. Gasol missed 26 games because of a stress fracture in his left foot and has not played since Nov. 4. Clippers: Tobias Harris was the Clippers' only double-digit scorer in the first half with 10 points and finished with 16. ... Los Angeles led four times and never by more than two points. ... Rivers said there was no update on the status of F Luc Mbah a Moute (knee). Mbah a Moute missed his 32nd straight game and has not played since Oct. 23. HAPPY HOMECOMING DeRozan's 25 points was his lowest total in four road games against the Clippers and Lakers, with the Compton, California native and former Southern California star averaging 30.8 points at Staples Center this season. ""You kind of want to come home and show out a little bit,"" DeRozan said. ""You always want to play well when you come home and unconsciously that's always on my mind."" NO ANSWERS The Clippers wanted to limit Aldridge after he scored 22 points in the first half, but the Spurs big man was more efficient in the second half. Aldridge had 16 points on 4-of-6 shooting and made 8-of-9 free throws in 18:27. ""Yeah, he destroyed all of our bigs tonight,"" Rivers said.","401071211"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Even when he's not having a big game, Evan Fournier is still the Orlando Magic's best option at the end of games. Fournier took an inbounds pass outside the 3-point arc, dribbled to the free throw line and shot a floating jumper that dropped through the nets as the buzzer sounded on Orlando's 109-107 win over the Detroit Pistons on Sunday. ""Evan wants the ball at the end, he has courage,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""That was not an easy shot, but if he can get a shot like that, you're comfortable he's going to make it."" D.J. Augustin had 26 points and eight assists, and Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon each scored 22 points to help the Magic win their second straight. Fournier finished with 13. With the clock winding down, Fournier was the easy call for the potential winning shot attempt. He had a 3-pointer to beat Cleveland at the buzzer earlier this season. ""I really embrace those moments,"" Fournier said. ""It's everyone's dream to have one buzzer beater in the NBA so having two is even better."" Fournier's winning basket ended a wild finish in which Detroit wiped out an eight-point deficit in the final three minutes only to lose for the 11th time in their last 14 games. Luke Kennard scored 16 points to lead the Pistons. Reggie Bullock and Blake Griffin had 15 apiece and Andre Drummond had 14 points and 15 rebounds. Detroit thought it had pushed the game into overtime when Bullock was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 2.5 seconds to go and made all three free throws to tie the score at 107. However, the Pistons couldn't come up with a stop when they needed one. ""Games don't come down to just one play,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""There were way too many possessions before that when we did things that get you beat. We just have to learn to do the simple things."" Neither team led by more than six points in the second half until Augustin sparked an 8-0 run with back-to-back 3-pointers and fed Jonathan Isaac for a fastbreak layup that gave Orlando a 95-87 lead with 7:07 left in the game. Later in the quarter, Augustin stole a rebound from Drummond, drove the lane and whipped a wraparound pass to Vucevic for an uncontested layup that made it 104-95 with 3 1/2 minutes to go. Detroit rallied quickly. A layup by Reggie Jackson cut the deficit to 105-104 with 8.9 seconds remaining. Orlando's Terrence Ross got loose for a breakaway dunk with 5.4 seconds to go but Bullock's free throws tied it. Fournier took the inbounds pass and immediately drove into the lane, lofting his shot just before the buzzer sound to give Orlando the win. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit came into the game off a season-worst 37-point loss to Indiana. ... Detroit is No. 1 in offensive rebounding advantage over opponents with a plus-110 margin coming in. The Pistons added to that, grabbing 17 rebounds to 10 for the Magic. ... Griffin took a nasty fall when he slipped on a wet floor while trying to inbound the ball after a turnover. Griffin lay on the floor for 15 seconds before getting up and continuing play. Magic: PG D.J. Augustin badly sprained his ankle after stepping on Griffin's foot with 1:44 left in the game, but stayed in the game. ... Orlando came in off as season-best 29-point win over Toronto. ... F Jonathon Simmons left the game in the second quarter with an ankle injury and did not return. ... The Magic outscored the Pistons 22-8 in points in the paint in the first quarter. MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING? Casey was upset enough with Detroit's performance in a 125-88 loss at Indiana on Friday to apologize to fans for ""one of the worst exhibitions we've put on the floor."" Two days later, he downplayed the impact of the 20-minute team meeting he had with players after the game. ""Nothing came out of the meeting that hasn't been said before,"" Casey said before Sunday's game. ""When you walk across the black lines, if you have your hard hat on and your boots tied, that is what this game is about. We haven't exemplified that enough consistently and until we do, we're going to be on a roller coaster.""","401071212"
"MIAMI --  Karl-Anthony Towns had a perfect day, unlike many Minnesota fans. His beloved Philadelphia Eagles earned the chance to defend their Super Bowl title -- and got that postseason berth because Minnesota lost its season finale, which kept the Vikings from the playoffs. ""Fly Eagles Fly,"" Towns said. Vikings fans probably weren't thrilled to hear that. Timberwolves fans, after the night Towns had, may forgive him. Towns' monster game -- 34 points, 18 rebounds, seven assists and six blocked shots -- led Minnesota past the Miami Heat 113-104 on Sunday night. He became the first player to post such a stat line since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had 35 points, 19 rebounds, nine assists and eight blocks for the Los Angeles Lakers against Phoenix on Nov. 14, 1975. ""I wanted to make the right plays that we needed to win,"" Towns said. ""I'm glad I was able to make them."" He made them in bunches. When Miami cut an 11-point Minnesota lead to two midway through the fourth, Towns took over: a short hook stopped what was a 9-0 Heat run, and was soon followed by a three-point play and then a 3-pointer to restore the 11-point lead. Miami didn't challenge again. ""The stat line was very impressive by itself,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But the impact of the timeliness of his plays ... every time it seemed we got it to six, he had a big bucket or a rebound or something that kept their momentum going."" Robert Covington scored 16 and Taj Gibson added 14 for Minnesota. The Wolves also got 13 apiece from Andrew Wiggins and Dario Saric, while Tyus Jones scored 12. Dwyane Wade led Miami with 21 points. Josh Richardson scored 17, Derrick Jones Jr. added 16 and Hassan Whiteside grabbed 13 rebounds for the Heat -- who ended the 2018 calendar year with a 43-43 record. ""We made strides this month,"" Wade said. ""The loss can take away from the success of this month, but we're making strides. We want to make sure in the new year, we understand how well we can play."" Miami led only once, and that was for all of 25 seconds. The Heat missed their first eight shots, and gave up 24 points off turnovers. ""I thought our defense was good,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I thought the start of the game was obviously important for us. It's hard to win on the road and this team has been playing great basketball. So it's a good solid win for us."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: It was the 13th time Towns has posted at least 30 points and 15 rebounds in a game. Minnesota, somewhat surprisingly, is now only 6-7 in such contests. ... Minnesota forced 20 turnovers, while committing only 11. Heat: Chris Bosh was back in the stands for a second consecutive game, plus was with Miami at practice on Saturday. ... Miami missed its first eight shots. ... Whiteside got three stitches over his left eye in the first quarter. He returned to the game. ... James Johnson missed the game with an illness. Jones Jr. started in his place, giving Miami its 15th starting lineup in 35 games. WAITERS CLEARED Heat guard Dion Waiters returned after two days of practice with Miami's G League affiliate in Sioux Falls, complained about how cold it was there, but more importantly declared himself ready to play again. ""I feel great. You ask those guys out there, I don't think I missed a shot. I'm talking about a lot of deep shots, too,"" Waiters said. He hasn't been in a game for the Heat since Dec. 22, 2017 -- but may make his season debut Wednesday in Cleveland. TWO POINTS Minnesota was without its two primary point guards: Derrick Rose missed the game with a right ankle sprain, and Jeff Teague missed his seventh consecutive game with left ankle inflammation. Rose hasn't appeared in a game at Miami since Dec. 6, 2016. Also out for Minnesota was Keita Bates-Diop, who was ill.","401071213"
"TORONTO --  A game against the defensive-minded Chicago Bulls wasn't the ideal situation for the Toronto Raptors to get their struggling offense back on track. In the end, Toronto did just enough to eke out a win. Kawhi Leonard scored 27 points, Pascal Siakam had 20 points and 12 rebounds and the Raptors beat Chicago 95-89 on Sunday night, their seventh straight victory over the Bulls. Danny Green and Fred VanVleet each scored 10 points as Toronto bounced back from its largest defeat of the season, a 29-point loss at Orlando on Friday. ""They definitely mucked up the game and made it ugly and dirty and slow,"" VanVleet said of the Bulls, who have lifted their defensive intensity under new coach Jim Boylen. ""Give them credit for that, but you've got to be able to win in different ways."" After setting season-lows in made baskets (28) and field goal percentage (.295) at Orlando, the Raptors got off to a rough start against the Bulls. They scored 14 points in the first quarter, matching their fewest in any frame this season. Leonard scored 12 points in the decisive fourth, going 8 for 8 at the free throw line. ""It was an uphill fist fight the whole way,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""We found a way to get to the basket eventually."" Lauri Markkanen had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Wendell Carter Jr. had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls, who didn't score for the first 3:19 of the fourth. ""I thought we battled,"" Boylen said. ""For about 36-38 minutes we controlled the game, we controlled the tempo. I'm really proud of our guys."" Chicago's Zach LaVine fouled out with 13 points. It was a poor shooting night for LaVine, who went 3 for 17, including 0 for 3 from 3-point range. ""I'm still coming off this ankle (injury) so I don't have the same lift but I've got to make them regardless,"" LaVine said. ""Just one of those days. I wish I could go back and make them."" Kris Dunn scored 14 points, and Justin Holiday and Chandler Hutchison each had 11 as the Bulls fell to 5-8 under Boylen. Raptors guard Kyle Lowry (sore lower back) sat for the seventh time in eight games. Toronto is 5-3 without the four-time All-Star. Ahead 68-65 to start the fourth, the Raptors got back-to-back 3-pointers from Delon Wright and Siakam and held a 74-65 lead at 10:10. Carter ended Chicago's drought with a hook shot at 8:41. The Bulls missed 12 of their first 15 shots in the final quarter. Markkanen's 3 at 1:21 brought Chicago within 85-82, but Leonard answered with a pair of free throws. After a missed shot by Dunn, Siakam was fouled and made a pair, giving Toronto an 89-82 advantage with 25 seconds to go. Toronto outscored the Bulls 13-2 in fast-break points and scored 21 points off 18 Chicago turnovers, a combination Boylen called ""gut-wrenching."" ""We gave them 45 points off things I think we've got to control better,"" he said. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago matched a season-low for opponent's points in the first half. ...

"DALLAS --  Dennis Smith Jr. was coming off a last-second gaffe in a Dallas loss when the second-year guard came through with two critical plays in a win over Oklahoma City: one at each end of the court. The 21-year-old hit the go-ahead layup before defending on a miss by Paul George , and the Dallas Mavericks surged past the Thunder late in a 105-103 victory Sunday night. Smith's key moments came two nights after he failed to get a shot off before the buzzer -- and missed it anyway -- in a 114-112 loss at New Orleans. It was his first game back after missing 11 with a sprained right wrist. The loss to the Pelicans was the second of two straight games against them, with Dallas winning the first. Now the Mavericks will play two in a row against the Thunder, this time in a back-to-back at Oklahoma City on Monday night. ""I am just trying to earn my respect in this league,"" said Smith, who scored 14 points while backcourt mate and 19-year-old rookie sensation Luka Doncic led Dallas with 25 points. George scored the last 13 points for Oklahoma City and finished with 36, but he missed the pull-up jumper with Smith defending with 2 seconds left. The Thunder still had a chance with 1.7 seconds left, but Russell Westbrook missed a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer to wrap up a rough shooting night for the 2017 MVP. He was 4 of 22 for nine points with nine rebounds and eight assists. It was the first time since April 12, 2017, that Westbrook didn't finish in double figures in at least one of those three categories. ""We got lucky because he had an off shooting night,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""And knowing him, I'm not looking forward to tomorrow night."" The Thunder led by as many as six in the final two minutes fueled by a pair of 3s from George, but the Mavericks chipped away thanks to missed shots and turnovers by Oklahoma City. Smith's layup for a 104-103 lead came after he dribbled away from the basket and reversed course to the hoop, easily speeding past Dennis Schroder and hitting the shot over a leaping Westbrook. ""I think there were some times where we did a great job defensively, and obviously there were some other times we broke down,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. DeAndre Jordan, who had 12 points and 17 rebounds, pulled Dallas to 101-99 with a thunderous dunk. The Thunder turned it over but Westbrook knocked away Harrison Barnes' pass to Doncic. Trailing the play, Jordan grabbed the loose ball and dunked without taking a dribble. George was 12 of 24 from the field but just 3 of 11 from 3 as the Thunder shot 24 percent from beyond the arc. Westbrook missed all eight of his attempts from long range. The Mavericks took their first 10-point lead on a 3 from Doncic while the Thunder went without a field goal for more than six minutes to start the third quarter. The lead reached 13 in the final minute of the third on a 3 from J.J. Barea. The Dallas lead was gone less than four minutes into the fourth quarter, with Oklahoma City getting even at 86 on a floater from Schroder, who scored 19 points. TIP-INS Thunder: Lost for first time with George scoring at least 30 points after winning the first five this season. ... Westbrook got a technical after he didn't get a call on a bump from Maxi Kleber when he drove for a layup that was short. ... Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson scored 10 points apiece while Steven Adams had nine rebounds and eight points. Mavericks: Won their 13th out of last 14 home games to improve to 15-3 at American Airlines Center. ... Barnes had 16 points, and Dorian Finney-Smith added 10. ... G Wesley Matthews missed his second game with right foot soreness. ... Smith got a technical for complaining going into a timeout about a no-call when Westbrook made contact with his face. RUSS DUD It was the fourth time this month that Westbrook has shot less than 25 percent of the field. ""Missing and making shots is part of the game, but I got to do a better job and that's on me,"" Westbrook said. DUELING GERMAN 3s The first of Dirk Nowitzki's six points came on a 3 with 34 seconds left in the first quarter, but the fellow German Schroder hit one in transition 5 seconds later to finish the scoring in an entertaining first quarter. Oklahoma City led 28-27 after the first.","401071215"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Portland Trail Blazers weren't concerned about guard C.J. McCollum's recent shooting slump. McCollum broke out of a six-game funk on Sunday night, hitting 13 of 18 shots in a 35-point performance as the Trail Blazers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 129-95. In his six previous games, McCollum was 35 percent from the floor, while shooting 16 percent from 3-point range. ""I don't think there's any question that he was going to break out at some point,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""Good for him. Good for us."" McCollum's white-hot night was felt throughout the team, as the Blazers shot a season-high 59 percent in routing Philadelphia. Al-Farouq Aminu had 16 points, Damian Lillard 15 and Jusuf Nurkic 14 for Portland. Ben Simmons scored 19 points to lead the 76ers, who were without center Joel Embiid due to soreness in his left knee. Embiid leads Philadelphia in scoring (26.5 points) and rebounds (13.3). McCollum gave signs of a turnaround during a five-minute stint of the first quarter, hitting his first three shots. McCollum then played the entire second quarter and continued to sizzle, making 7 of 11 shots. From McCollum's viewpoint, nothing changed Sunday from the previous six games -- other than the ball going through the basket on a regular basis. ""I've been getting some of the same looks I've been getting my entire life, and I wasn't making them. But I understand how I approach the game, how much time I put in. . I figured the tide would turn eventually,"" McCollum said. ""I felt good the last few games. I just tried to get into a rhythm. I made some shots and that made it a little easier for everyone else."" McCollum's shooting rebound was part of the puzzle for Portland. Without Embiid inside, the Blazers handled Philadelphia on the boards 59-36. Several 76ers said the energy wasn't there defensively. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said the loss of Embiid was a blow. ""I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think he's a defensive player of the year,"" Brown said. ""Whether you look at points in the paint, whether you look at the rebounding margin. . The guys that we had, we just struggled defending them."" Early on, it appeared as though Philadelphia might get by without Embiid. The 76ers hit their first four shots and led 13-7. Nothing went right the rest of the first half for Philadelphia, however, as Portland quickly erased the deficit and ran away from the 76ers. The Blazers had runs of 12-1 and 8-0 to take a 31-20 lead after the first quarter. It was a warmup act for Portland's 39-point second quarter, where the Blazers started by scoring the first 12 points. McCollum scored 19 of his 26 first-half points during the second quarter, as the Blazers built a 70-41 halftime lead. After making its first four field goal tries, Philadelphia hit just 4 of its next 27 shots. It was no match for Blazers, who shot 67 percent (29 of 43) during the first half. Portland's defense that caught Stotts' eye as much as the sharp shooting. ""We didn't let the fact that we were playing good offense take away from our defense. I thought the effort was consistent throughout,"" Stotts said. NURKIC BREAKING OUT Nurkic, Portland's center, is on a dominant run in the post of late. During his past three games, including two against Golden State, Nurkic has made 25 of 43 shots and is averaging 20.7 points and 9.7 rebounds. ""It's very encouraging,"" Stotts said. ""It's part of his growth. But he's got to continue it."" TIP-INS 76ers: Coach Brett Brown said Embiid was held out of Sunday's game as a precaution. ""It's not anything we're concerned about,"" Brown said. ... Replacing Embiid was Amir Johnson, who made his second start of the season. Trail Blazers: Forward Maurice Harkless (knee) didn't play. Evan Turner replaced Harkless in the starting lineup. ... The 34-point margin is Portland's most lopsided win of the season.","401071216"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers gave LeBron James a big present for his 34th birthday on Sunday -- they proved they could win a game without him. The Lakers trailed the Sacramento Kings by seven with 4:30 remaining in the fourth quarter before outscoring them 18-4 the rest of the way en route to a 121-114 victory. It is the first time in three games that the Lakers have won since James was sidelined with a groin injury. James arrived at Staples Center a couple minutes after the game tipped off and got a rousing ovation. He left immediately after the game, and there is no timetable on when he will return to the court. ""When we feel comfortable on the basketball court it gives us a better chance to win,"" said Brandon Ingram, who scored 21 points, including nine in the fourth. ""We just continue to show growth in tight situations we are in."" The Kings led 110-103 with 4:30 remaining when the Lakers scored 12 straight points over a three minute span to take control. Ingram, who had seven points during the run, tied it at 110 with a pullup jumper and then hit a 3-pointer with 2:13 remaining to give Los Angeles a 113-110 lead. A steal and layup by Iman Shumpert brought the Kings within three, but Caldwell-Pope made a driving layup to make it a two-possession game. Lakers coach Luke Walton said it was Ingram's most complete game of the season. The third-year forward also had a season-high nine assists and seven rebounds. ""He seemed to have a joy about him playing tonight that, when he has it, it is a lot of fun to watch,"" Walton said. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the Lakers (21-16) with a season-high 26 points, and Josh Hart added 22. Caldwell-Pope had 17 points during the second half, including going 4 of 9 on 3-pointers. ""Coach wants me to shoot more and that's what I did tonight. It felt good to get a rhythm,"" Caldwell-Pope said. De'Aaron Fox led Sacramento (19-17) with 26 points, while Buddy Hield and Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 21 apiece. ""This is one we should have closed out and we didn't,"" Hield said. ""We had our minds on going into 2019 with 20 wins but we have more work to do. We can't just be happy with where we are at right now."" Sacramento led by four at halftime and was up 85-74 with 5:35 remaining in the third quarter before the Lakers scored 12 straight points to take the lead. Caldwell-Pope keyed the run with nine points, including a pair of 3-pointers. The Lakers' lead lasted only 15 seconds, however, as Hield hit a 3-pointer and the Kings outscored Los Angeles 11-6 over the remainder of the quarter. Sacramento shot 53.8 percent from the field during the first three quarters and was 12 of 24 on 3-pointers. However in the final 12 minutes it was 8 of 24 from the field and just 1 of 10 from long distance. BOUNCING BACK It was the second time in four nights that the Kings and Lakers played. Sacramento won 117-116 on Dec. 27 on a 3-pointer by Bogdanovic at the buzzer. That was the first game James had missed since injuring his groin during the Dec. 25 game at Golden State. The Lakers were 0-2 in James' absence. TIP-INS Kings: Willie Cauley-Stein had 11 points and 12 rebounds. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Myles Turner provided the Indiana Pacers with a more physical presence over the past month. They're hoping he keeps it up -- with a revamped look. Turner scored 20 points, grabbed eight rebounds and blocked four shots in less than 24 minutes Monday, helping to lead the Indiana Pacers past Atlanta 116-108 before breaking his nose midway through the third quarter. ""Luckily it wasn't anything major,"" All-Star guard Victor Oladipo said after scoring 22 points. ""He'll be back. He'll be fine. He'll be all right with the mask but he's going to have to get used to it."" Turner departed with 4:44 left in the third quarter and did not return. While his status for Friday's game, at Chicago, remains uncertain there's little doubt Turner had been playing the best basketball of his four-year career. His scoring had increased, his rebounding became more consistent and after finishing third in blocks each of the past two years, Turner had moved into the NBA lead. He helped the Pacers weather Oladipo's 11-game absence and has played a key role in a seven-game winning streak that ended in mid-December and the five-game streak Indiana is currently on. If there is good news, though, it's this: Oladipo may have delivered his most complete game since returning from a knee injury Dec. 12, and the Pacers have a solid supporting cast. Oladipo was 9 of 19 from the field, had four rebounds and seven assists and four steals. Domantas Sabonis, Turner's replacement, wound up with 20 points and eight rebounds as Indiana became the third NBA team to record 25 wins this season. ""We're confident, we just have to keep the confidence rolling,"" Turner said, downplaying the injury. ""Just keep being ourselves, don't try to do too much and keep our defensive efforts high."" Atlanta was led by John Collins finished with 22 points and 16 rebounds while rookie Kevin Huerter scored 22 points and made six 3-pointers, both season highs. The Hawks have lost only two of their last seven, both to Indiana in the last week. Turner's 3-pointer at the end of the half broke a 60-60 tie and Indiana opened the second half with back-to-back baskets to take a 67-60 lead. They started pulling away when Turner and Bojan Bogdanovic made consecutive 3s to extend the lead to 87-76 and appeared to seal the victory by scoring the final eight points of the quarter to make it 97-81. Instead, Atlanta steadily cut the deficit and got as close as 114-108 but didn't score another point against the league's top defense. ""We get it to a two-possession game, we just picked the wrong time to turn the ball over,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We struggled to execute down the stretch and didn't give ourselves the opportunity to make shots."" TIP-INS Hawks: All three of Atlanta's losses to Indiana this season have come by eight points. ... The Hawks have lost five straight at Indianapolis with their last win coming 23, 2016. ... Daniel Hamilton scored eight points in place of the injured Kent Bazemore. ... Collins has six straight double-doubles. ... Alex Len had 19 points and seven rebounds while Trae Young had 16 points and seven assists. ... The Hawks had a 53-39 rebounding advantage. Pacers: Finished the calendar year as the NBA's only team that did not lose three straight games. ... Indiana is 19-5 against Eastern Conference teams and 11-2 at home against the East. ... The Pacers have won 12 of their last 14 with all each of those wins coming by six or more points. ... It marked the first time this season the Pacers had three players score 20 at least points in the same game this season. ... Bogdanovic scored 16 points, extending his streak of consecutive double-figure games to 28. SHORT-HANDED HAWKS Bazemore is expected to miss at least two weeks with a sprained right ankle. He was injured during the third quarter of Saturday's victory over Cleveland. Atlanta also played without center Dewayne Dedmon, who has a sore left knee. ""It's been described to me as similar to tendinitis in the knee,"" Pierce said.","401071218"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Even after losing two starters to injury, Charlotte coach James Borrego had reason to be encouraged. The Hornets' 125-100 victory Monday night, their franchise-record 13th straight win over the Magic, included the kind of team play the first-year coach has been seeking. ""I think there was an unselfish spirit out there,"" Borrego said. ""It started with the first group. The second group came in, and they kept it moving. I felt, for the most part for 48 minutes, it was a very complete, unselfish ball-movement game."" Kemba Walker scored 24 points in just 27 minutes. He had 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting in the first half and did not play in the fourth quarter. Malik Monk added 21 points as the Hornets put six players in double figures in the easy victory over the Magic and Steve Clifford, who coached Charlotte for five seasons. It was Monk's fourth 20-point game in 32 appearances this season, after he had five all of last year. Monk said he wants to bring energy off the bench and ""attack, attack, attack."" ""If nothing else worked, I would give it up,"" he said. ""But it was working tonight, so I'm just going to try to keep doing that."" Cody Zeller added 14 points in 24 minutes before fracturing a bone in his right hand in the third quarter. He will miss an unspecified amount of time, pending further evaluation. ""I feel bad for Cody because he's having such a great year, a big year for us,"" Borrego said. ""It's just an unfortunate break for him."" Jeremy Lamb strained his right hamstring in the first quarter and also did not return. The Hornets improved to 18-18 with their second win in three games. Aaron Gordon scored 14 points and Nikola Vucevic had 12, but he did not play after leaving the court with a knee injury late in the third quarter. Mo Bamba had 12 rebounds in 18 minutes for the Magic, who opened a six-game trip by having a two-game winning streak snapped. Orlando led 14-4 in the opening minutes, but the Hornets answered with a 20-4 run over the next 4  1/2 minutes. Charlotte's first-quarter lead reached 36-23 after a dunk by Monk. Walker found Monk open in the corner for a 3-pointer as the first half clock expired, giving the Hornets a 63-53 lead. Marvin Williams, Willy Hernangomez and Devonte Graham added 10 points apiece for the Hornets. The Hornets got a boost off the bench from rookie guard Graham, who scored all his points in the third quarter, helping the Hornets extend their lead to 95-77 through three. TIP-INS Magic: D.J. Augustin (sprained right ankle) and Jonathan Simmons (sprained left ankle) did not play. Jerian Grant started in place of Augustin. . With the score tied at 18, Jonathan Isaac missed a breakaway dunk. The Hornets took their first lead on the next possession on Lamb's runner and never trailed again. Hornets: Lamb played nine minutes and finished with nine points and hit all four of his shots. . Zeller also had six rebounds in 24 minutes. CLIFFORD RETURNS Clifford's Charlotte teams went 196-214 and made two playoff appearances. His first visit back came one day after the Magic's 109-107 home win over Detroit, though, so it left little time to reminisce. ""As you know, I loved my time here,"" Clifford said before the game. ""These back-to-backs man, it's so hectic. We got here last night, I was up early, watched tape all day and just walked in here. So this wasn't one of those trips where there was really much time to think about anything."" BOTH SIDES OF THE STREAK Oddly, Clifford now finds himself on the other side of the Hornets' 13-game win streak against the Magic. Instead of trying to add to it, he'd now like to end it. ""I always felt like we played some of our best games, and I never thought it was a matchup or anything, but it's something we have to figure out, obviously,"" he said.","401071219"
"HOUSTON --  While Houston Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni and James Harden's teammates raved about his latest big game on Monday night, the Beard was busy critiquing himself and pointing out ways he could have played better. ""I did a poor job of just not controlling the basketball, basically giving them transition points by turnovers,"" he said. ""I have to take care of the ball more, but just continue to be aggressive and make plays for my team."" Harden had 43 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in his fourth straight 40-point game, leading the Rockets over the Memphis Grizzlies 113-101 for their fifth consecutive victory. While Harden was unhappy with his nine turnovers, D'Antoni was effusive in his praise for the superstar, who has carried the team with fellow All-Star Chris Paul out with a hamstring injury. ""I don't know how you get any better than what he's playing,"" D'Antoni said. ""Defensively, too. He comes up with steals, triple-doubles like it's nothing. So yeah, he's playing at a different level."" Harden set an NBA record with his eighth straight game with at least 35 points and five assists, besting Oscar Robertson, who twice had seven-game streaks. Harden finished with his fourth triple-double this season and 39th overall. Houston has won 10 of its last 11 to improve to 21-15. Harden continued his incredible run that has powered Houston's surge up the Western Conference standings after a slow start, making six 3-pointers and 21 of 27 free throws. He has made at least four 3-pointers in eight straight games has finished with 30 points or more in 10 games in a row. The Rockets, who spent the early part of the season in the basement of the conference standings, are tied with the Clippers for fourth place in the West. ""It's a good feeling, it could be better though,"" Harden said. ""We're trying to get that No. 1 spot so we've got to continue to build."" The Grizzlies cut the lead to nine with about 90 seconds left. But P.J. Tucker made a free throw for Houston before Austin Rivers added a layup to make it 113-101 and seal the victory with about 35 seconds left. Harden grabbed his 10th rebound seconds after that to complete his triple-double. Kyle Anderson had 20 points and Mike Conley added 19 for the Grizzlies, who lost for the seventh time in nine games. Houston was up by 13 to start the fourth and back-to-back baskets by Clint Capela made it 93-77 with about 9 minutes left. Harden made four straight free throws for the Rockets later in the fourth to leave them up 98-83. But the Grizzlies scored four quick points, with the last basket coming when Anderson stole the ball from Harden, to cut it to 98-87 with 5 1/2 to go. Green answered with a 3-pointer and Houston stretched the lead to 103-87 with about 4 minutes left. The Rockets led by double digits for most of the night and were up by 23 after two free throws by Harden midway through the third quarter. Memphis closed out the third with a 14-3 run to get within 86-73 entering the fourth. Marc Gasol led the way in that stretch, scoring five points. The Rockets led 61-38 at halftime behind 28 points from Harden. He capped his huge first half by making two 3s in the last 31 seconds of the half, capped by one that was well behind the line with Anderson in his face. ""James has been playing at a high level,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Some of the shots that he made in the first half, they are indefensible. I thought our guys showed a lot of character by the way they responded in the second half. They put a lot more pressure on him and forced him into some turnovers."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Gasol has at least one 3-pointer in 13 straight games, which ties a career high. Rockets: James Ennis missed his 10th straight game with a strained right hamstring. Coach Mike D'Antoni said he should return for Houston's next game. ...Paul missed his fifth game with a strained left hamstring. He said Monday that he's doing better but doesn't know when he'll return. ... Green made four 3-pointers in the first quarter and finished with 18 points and six 3s.  ... Eric Gordon sat out with a bruised right knee. THEY SAID IT Tucker on how Houston's recent run: ""It's not great yet. We're winning some games. But they haven't been perfect. They haven't been all pretty. But we'll take `em. Wins are wins but it still isn't the level that we want to be at.""","401071220"
"SAN ANTONIO --  San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich had to use some colorful language to explain to the Spurs at halftime that their lack of aggression was troubling him. The Spurs responded with their highest-scoring quarter in 25 years. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 32 points and San Antonio rode a 46-point third quarter to a 120-111 victory over the Boston Celtics on Monday night. DeMar DeRozan, who had 13 points and 10 assists, said the Spurs were ""cussed out by Pop"" at halftime after shooting 22 percent in the first quarter. ""We were playing really tentative, real indecisive, hesitating, wasn't being aggressive,"" DeRozan said. ""The whole dynamic of us, our aggression, changed. We just got out (in the second half) and played like we've been playing."" Derrick White had a career-high 22 points for San Antonio, which has won 11 of 13 to close within four games of the top spot in the Western Conference. The Spurs made 19 of 25 shots (76 percent) in the third quarter and finished with its best period since 1993. It was their 12th-highest output of any quarter in franchise history and second-highest in the third. The Spurs opened the game 1 for 6 from the field and shot 22 percent in the opening period while scoring a season-low 17 points in the first quarter. Boston shot better from 3-point (35 percent) than San Antonio did from the field (33) in the first half. Jaylen Brown had a season-high 30 points, but Boston was unable to maintain its first-half advantage. ""Seemed like they were just waiting in the weeds,"" said Kyrie Irving, who had 16 points and eight assists. ""I'm pretty sure Pop got in their rear ends and really told them play hard or you're not stepping on the floor and you just see that maximum level just go up and our level just stayed the same."" Irving suffered a scratched cornea in both eyes during a collision with Marco Belinelli with 7:22 remaining in the game. Irving exited to the locker room but returned to the bench and game a couple minutes later. Boston coach Brad Stevens was unsure of Irving's status for Wednesday's home game against Minnesota. ""I'm wearing sunglasses, so not too good,"" Irving said when asked how he felt, ""but it'll be all right though."" Still, Irving was more upset with the pounding the Spurs put on the Celtics. San Antonio attacked the paint in the second half with brawny Boston post Aron Baynes out due to a fractured finger. Aldridge finished scored 12 points in the third quarter and 17 in the second half. He finished 13 for 23 from the field along with nine rebounds, five assists and two blocked shots. ""He's been a beast, without a doubt,"" Popovich said. White also took advantage of the lack of rim protection, scoring 13 points on 5-for-6 shooting in the second half. He also led the defense on Irving. ""For the game, they said you've got to make him work on defense,"" White said. ""If you just let him play one side of the court, it will be a long night for us. So, I just wanted to make him work down there and attack."" San Antonio forward Davis Bertans was 5 for 8 on 3-pointers in scoring 17 points. The Spurs finished 14 for 26 on 3-pointers. TIP-INS Celtics: After taking New Year's Day off, Boston returns to action Jan. 2 to open a four-game homestand. . Brown's previous season high of 23 points came Dec. 8 at Chicago. Spurs: Gay missed his fifth game of the season, missing three previously due to a sore right heel and sitting out another for rest. Popovich is not sure how long the sprained left wrist will sideline Gay. San Antonio is 2/3 without Gay. ... Jakob Poeltl made his fourth start of the season and first since Oct. 24. Poeltl started three of the Spurs' first four games before joining the team's bench. ... Spurs center Pau Gasol received a big ovation in his first game since Nov. 4. Gasol missed 26 games with a stress fracture in his right foot. He was active for the past two games on the road against the Nuggets and Clippers, but the Spurs chose to keep him out until returning home. WHAT'S NEXT DeRozan was extremely upset when Toronto traded him and Poeltl to San Antonio for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green in the offseason. He vowed to gain revenge on the Raptors when they faced the Spurs but has since accepted the trade and admits he isn't focused on Thursday's matchup. ""Honestly, I wish I had something cool to say to look for it, but I haven't thought about it at all,"" DeRozan said. ""I'm pretty sure once I get the questions about it, at some point I'm going to get to it but I haven't been thinking about it.""","401071221"
"NEW ORLEANS --  It would seem the last thing the struggling Pelicans needed was to find out shortly before tip-off that perennial All-Star Anthony Davis was too sick to play. But with Elfrid Payton returning to the lineup, they not only managed to stay competitive with Minnesota, but also kicked a recent habit of wilting in crunch time. Julius Randle had 33 points and 11 rebounds, Darius Miller scored 13 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and New Orleans held off the Timberwolves 123-114 on Monday night. ""My mindset doesn't change regardless of who's in the game,"" Randle said of how he reacted when he learned Davis was out. ""A lot of people played really well, stepped up big."" Miller hits five 3s, his last from the left wing to put the Pelicans up 115-109 with 1:12 to go. ""It was on tonight,"" Miller said, noting that Randle, Payton and Jrue Holiday effectively forced defenders to collapse into the paint and leave openings on the perimeter. ""The guys did a great job of hitting me when I was open"" After Robert Covington's 3 for the Wolves made it a one-possession game in the final minute, Miller came back with two free throws on New Orleans' next possession. Holiday, who had 26 points, added three late free throws -- one of them after Karl-Anthony Towns was assessed a technical foul -- and the Wolves were unable to recover. E'Twaun Moore scored 17 points for the Pelicans, who've won two of three since ending a five-game skid. Towns finished with 28 points and 17 rebounds, scoring 10 of his points during a tight fourth quarter before fouling out with 12.5 seconds left. Andrew Wiggins scored 20 points for Minnesota, while Taj Gibson scored 17and Covington 16. ""I'm still scratching my head wondering what happened,"" Gibson said. ""It felt just like we needed a little bit more energy. The way we started the game out, it felt like we just let them get a little comfortable. ""We could've got this one, especially with Davis out. But everybody is in the NBA for a reason,"" Gibson added. ""They had a couple guys step up and hit some big shots."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Guard Derrick Rose missed his second straight game with a right ankle sprain. ... Forward Keita Bates-Diop missed his second straight game with an illness. ... Tyus Jones scored 15 points and Gorgui Dieng added 10 points. ... The Wolves fell to 5-14 on the road. Pelicans: After starting in place of Davis, Jahlil Okafor was called for three fouls within the first five minutes of the game and was subbed out in favor of Cheick Diallo. Okafor wound up playing just 14 minutes and had seven points and seven rebounds.  ... The Pelicans improved to 13-6 at home. ... Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said Davis ""tried and tried"" to play, even receiving intravenous fluids leading up to game time. ""Obviously, he's very sick. There wasn't anything that he could do about it."" PAYTON'S PLACE Payton's return from a fractured finger on his left, non-shooting hand came after a 22-game absence that spanned six weeks. Playing about six minutes per quarter, Payton contributed nine points, six assists, a rebound and a steal while wearing tape over his previous injured finger. ""He pushes the pace. He gets to the basket. I don't think he finished as well as he wanted to, but to be able to get there and make plays out of that was huge for us,"" Holiday said, praising Payton's defensive acumen as well. ""Obviously, he added a lot of energy in his first game back in a long time, so it was fun to have him out there."" PERIMETER PROWESS Without Davis available to help attack the rim, the Pelicans shot decisively from 3 and it paid off as they hit 56 percent (14 of 25) from deep. New Orleans went 9 of 13 from 3-point range in the first half, when they led by as many as 14. That opened up the paint for Randle, who scored 18 in the first half, although even one of his field goals came from deep. The Wolves also let fly from beyond the arc early and often, but with far different results, hitting only three of their first 16 from long range while shooting just worse than 40 percent (21 of 53) overall in the first half. RALLYING BACK When Randle hit his second 3 of the game early in the second half, New Orleans was shooting 71.4 percent (10 of 14) from deep, and led by 15. But that's when Minnesota suddenly rediscovered its offense, outscoring the Pelicans by 16 the rest of the third quarter. Covington helped ignite the comeback with consecutive 3s. Wiggins added another from long range and Towns hit from 27 feet out to tie it late in the period.","401071222"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook promised he'd be better on Monday night against the Dallas Mavericks, and he kept his word. Westbrook had 32 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for his 10th triple-double of the season and the Oklahoma City Thunder gained a split of their back-to-back against the Mavericks, never trailing in a 122-102 victory. Paul George added 22 points and Jerami Grant had 16 for the Thunder, who had dropped three of their last four games. That included a 105-103 loss at Dallas on Sunday, when Oklahoma City blew a six-point lead in the final 1:59 and Westbrook went 4 of 22 from the field and scored only nine points. Westbrook promised after that game, ""We play tomorrow and I'll be better from then on,"" and he responded by going 13 of 24 from the field and knocking down midrange shots with regularity -- often banking them in -- as the Thunder built a 60-43 halftime lead. ""If I'm in that area, I'm going to shoot that same shot,"" he said. ""Why do anything different? If they give you the same shot, then take it. Part of this game is keeping it simple. When you keep it simple, it makes the game easier for everybody else, not just myself. Keeping it simple is something I've tried to learn over the course of the years."" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle burned five of his seven timeouts in the first half in an effort to stem the tide, but the Mavericks proved unable to overcome a 1-for-9 start from the field. Dallas committed 29 turnovers, the most ever by a Thunder opponent. ""They had a lot to do with it, but we could do better,"" Carlisle said. ""We'll keep working at it. You can always find positives in games. . But right now we've got to fixate on taking better care of the ball."" Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 25 points, matching his career high with seven 3-pointers in nine attempts, and Luca Doncic had 17 points. The Mavericks are 2-16 on the road, offsetting their 15-3 home record. As the Mavericks were misfiring to start the game, George scored 16 points in the first quarter as Oklahoma City built a 17-point lead. The Thunder led by as many as 22 in the first half. ""We were on our heels early and never really got our bearings,"" Carlisle said. ""That kills you on the road."" Consecutive 3-pointers by Dennis Smith Jr. and Doncic pulled Dallas within 69-57, but a bucket by George, a steal and layup by Westbrook and an alley-oop dunk by Grant off Westbrook's pass led Carlisle to burn his final timeout at the 6:45 mark of the third quarter, with his team down 75-57. Despite going 8 of 13 from 3-point range in the quarter, Dallas made no headway, trailing 92-75 at its end. Barnes hit two more 3-pointers to cut the margin to 94-81 with 10:59 left, but George scored and Abdel Nader followed with a 3-pointer to rebuild Oklahoma City's lead. Dallas came no closer than 14 points the rest of the way.

After playing Dallas on consecutive days, the Thunder won't see the Mavericks again until March 31. NADER TAKES ADVANTAGE Playing time has been difficult to come by for Nader, but the absence of Alex Abrines in recent games has allowed Nader an opportunity for more minutes, and he's played well. He scored 18 points in 33 minutes in a win at Phoenix on Friday before scoring 10 on 4-of-6 shooting in his 12 1/2 minutes on Monday. ""One thing the coaching staff here preaches is you stay ready, never get ready,"" Nader said. ""I think I've done a good job of that all season long, so when my number is called, I don't miss a beat."" George said it's good to see teammates like Nader perform well when given the chance. ""The good thing about this group, when someone goes down, the next guy steps up and they're ready for that role,"" George said. ""We need all our guys. Our young guys are starting to step up for us.""","401071223"
"PHOENIX --  The Golden State Warriors needed until midway through the second quarter to find their rhythm against the West's last-place team. Once they did, the NBA champions rolled to victory again. Stephen Curry scored 34 points and Kevin Durant added 25, leading the Warriors over the Phoenix Suns 132-109 on Monday night. The Warriors beat the Suns for the 17th straight time, including eight in a row in Phoenix. Golden State (25-13) was 14 for 28 on 3-pointers, with Curry going 5 of 9. ""Pretty much the whole second quarter and beyond, we were just disciplined defensively and played with a purpose on offense,"" Curry said. ""Created good shots. It was a great night."" Deandre Ayton had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who have lost five of six. T.J Warren added 24 points and Devin Booker 20. Golden State led for all but 1 minute, 17 seconds of the first half, though the Suns stayed close early. The Warriors went ahead 39-31 on a 3 from Curry with 10 minutes to go in the second. Curry had 12 points in the second quarter and added a team-high nine rebounds for the game. The Suns scored the next eight points to tie it, and were even at 45 before the Warriors closed out the half on a 24-7 run. A 3 from Andre Iguodala, a layup and free throw from Jonas Jerebko and Iguodala's pair of free throws gave the Warriors a 69-52 lead at the break. ""There's such a low margin for error when you play the champs,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. Ayton's hook shot with 6:19 left in the third quarter cut the Warriors' lead to 82-72, but Golden State took control again. A 3 and two free throws from Durant gave the Warriors a 100-81 lead with 1:38 to play. ""I thought we slowed them down and we beat them with our minds instead of just outrunning them,"" Durant said. ""Our offense and our talent just take over and we just made shots."" Quinn Cook knocked down a 3 just before the third-quarter buzzer for a 108-87 lead, and Curry's two 3s early in the fourth quarter helped Golden State go up by 27 points. ""They just turned it up,"" Ayton said. ""They got a lot of transition baskets, they got a lot of early stops and forced a lot of tough shots."" DEFENDING DEANDRE The Warriors, in the absence of a true big man, used starters Kevon Looney and Draymond Green plus Jordan Bell off the bench to guard the 7-foot-1 Ayton. No Golden State defender on Ayton was taller than 6-9. Bell was the most physical of the group and was rewarded with extended minutes. He blocked Ayton's shot under the basket in the third quarter and at the other end by made all five shots he took for a season-high 10 points. ""I just tried to get a little closer to the rim and wherever my man went, I just cut right behind him,"" Bell said. ""Tried to keep him (Ayton) off the offensive board. Tough, tough task to do that."" BENCH BLAST Golden State's bench combined for 46 points, and drew praise from coach Steve Kerr. ""I thought the second unit mid-second quarter changed the whole game,"" Kerr said.

"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard was so good Tuesday night, Raptors coach Nick Nurse just wanted to enjoy the show. Leonard scored a career-high 45 points, Pascal Siakam had a career-best 28 points with 10 rebounds, and Toronto beat the Utah Jazz 122-116. ""That's good, we all got to witness that live and in person,"" Nurse said of Leonard's outburst. ""He was phenomenal. I've kind of been waiting for one of these nights where he makes them all."" Norman Powell scored a season-high 14 points, and the Raptors won their fourth straight at home despite playing without All-Star guard Kyle Lowry (sore back) and center Jonas Valanciunas (dislocated left thumb). ""The way he's playing right now is really big for our team with a lot of guys out,"" Powell said of Leonard. Leonard shot 16 for 22 overall, missing all three attempts from 3-point range, and went 13 for 17 at the free-throw line. He said he wasn't aware of his scoring achievement until after the game. ""I try to stay in the moment and keep competing every possession and not worry about myself, just try to get a team win,"" Leonard said. It was the third 40-point game of Leonard's career, including a 43-point effort against Memphis in Game 4 of the first round in April 2017. Leonard has scored 20 or more points in a career-best 14 straight games. Jae Crowder scored a career-high 30 points, Derrick Favors had 21 and Donovan Mitchell scored 19 as the Jazz dropped to 10-12 on the road and 18-20 overall. ""Jae was hot,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's unfortunate that we didn't capitalize on the night that he had."" Utah's Rudy Gobert scored 16 points, and Ricky Rubio had 14. Leonard made all seven of his field-goal attempts in the third quarter and added five foul shots. His 19 points were the second most in any quarter by a Raptors player this season. ""He scored in the post, he scored in isolations, he scored going to the rim over Rudy,"" Snyder said. ""Eventually we started hitting him when he walked across half court.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks started the new year much like the finished the last one. Antetokounmpo threw down a spectacular one-handed dunk, Brook Lopez continued to show off his long-range shooting prowess and the Bucks cruised past the Detroit Pistons 121-98 on Tuesday night. Milwaukee has won four straight and eight of nine and is an NBA-best 26-10. Antetokounmpo had just 15 points, but his slam over Jon Leuer was the highlight of the night. Antetokounmpo blew past Andre Drummond, jumped and reached his right arm over a leaping Leuer for the slam during the first quarter. ""It's fun to have nights like this,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Everybody has energy and plays hard."" Khris Middleton had 22 points and Eric Bledsoe had 18 for Milwaukee. Lopez had 25 points and made 7 of 12 from 3-point range, capping off the night by nailing a shot from beyond the sideline hashmark in the fourth. ""I was feeling good."" Lopez said. ""We were moving the ball really well and I was just trying to space the floor. My guys were making great passes to me all night. They're so good at attacking the basket, drawing people and kicking out."" Blake Griffin had 29 points and nine rebounds, and Reggie Jackson scored 19 points for Detroit, which fell to 16-19. After leading 92-73 after three quarters, the Bucks built a 28-point lead midway through the fourth. ""That team is a very good team,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""But there's another competitive level we can get to. We've got some guys that are laying it on the line but not enough."" NOT BASHFUL Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer admitted he isn't always thrilled with the shot selection of Lopez, who became the first center in NBA history, and the first Bucks player ever, to make seven or more 3s in consecutive games. ""I've learned that he's going to make some of them,"" Budenholzer said. ""There are times when I'm like `What is he doing?' Then they go in and I sit back down."" CASEY STEAMED Casey said officials refused to review a play in the waning seconds in which he claimed Langston Galloway caught an elbow to the eye from Bucks forward Thon Maker. ""I was trying to get the officials to review it,"" Casey said. ""(Referee) Karl Lane yelled at me: `Turn it in then.' I was just saying look at it.""

"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic's teammates are definitely hard to impress. He bounced a rebound off a player as he's falling out of bounds and later delivered a no-look pass that completely froze a defender. He also finished with a triple-double. ""Another day at the office,"" Gary Harris said. ""That's what he does. It's one of those days again."" Jokic had 19 points, 14 rebounds and 15 assists, including that late no-look pass to wrap things up, as the Denver Nuggets kept right on rolling by beating the New York Knicks 115-108 on Tuesday night for their ninth straight home victory. It was the Jokic Show with the 7-footer posting his third triple-double of the season. Jokic did a little bit of everything, including a heads-up play with 1:21 left and Denver leading 111-105. He grabbed a rebound and threw it off the back of Tim Hardaway Jr. as he was tumbling out of bounds. With about 30 seconds left, Jokic delivered a no-look pass to Malik Beasley to seal the win. Does anything surprise the Nuggets when it comes to him? ""Nah,"" said Beasley, who scored a career-high 23 points. As for the ""M-V-P"" chants at the end of the game, Jokic definitely heard them and appreciated the support. ""But let's go step by step,"" Jokic said. In the old days, this sort of game would've been a trap for the Nuggets. They were facing a struggling Knicks team that was coming off a 32-point loss in Utah last Saturday. But on a night when the defense faltered at times, the Western Conference-leading Nuggets found a way to pull it out. ""As a young team, we accepted the challenge and got better tonight,"" Paul Millsap said. Denver has knocked off the Knicks 11 straight times at the Pepsi Center. It was far from easy, though, with the Nuggets needing a big 3-pointer from Jokic with 2:55 remaining to finally gain some separation. The Knicks have lost eight in a row. ""We competed. We competed hard,"" Knicks guard Emmanuel Mudiay said. ""We had a chance, but we didn't get it."" Luke Kornet led the Knicks with 19 points, while reserve Enes Kanter scored 17 points and grabbed 12 points. Kanter recently voiced his displeasure about his role with the Knicks. ""I'm very sad seeing my teammates out there losing,"" Kanter explained. ""I hate losing, man. I'm not going to accept losing. Every time I'm out there I'm trying my best to get a win."" The Nuggets are steadily getting back to health. They had Harris on the court after he missed 11 games with a hip injury. Over the weekend, Millsap returned to the court from a broken toe. Millsap had 16 points against the Knicks. Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone expressed concern over Denver's defensive intensity of late. The Nuggets tightened things up in the second half after falling behind by as many as 10 points in the second quarter. ""I'd much rather learn, teach, clean up after ugly wins than I would after tough losses,"" Malone said. ""That's the positive. We're finding ways to win when maybe we're not playing our `A' game."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York's last win in Denver was Nov. 8, 2006, when Carmelo Anthony suited up for the Nuggets. ... F Noah Vonleh grabbed 14 rebounds. ... F Kevin Knox scored 18.

""That's one of my good friends,"" Harris said. ""I'm happy to see his success in New York."" HAPPY BIRTHDAY? Although a popular basketball site lists Malone's birthday as Jan. 1, 1971, he insisted it was not his birthday. ""Somebody else sent me a random text of happy birthday,"" Malone said. ""It's a mystery. Don't believe everything you read."" Asked when his birthday was, Malone joked: ""You writing a book?""","401071227"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Damian Lillard woke up Tuesday morning feeling out of sorts and didn't get much better through the first three quarters against Sacramento. When Portland needed him the most, however, their All-Star guard came through in a big way. It wasn't necessarily Michael Jordan dropping 38 on Utah in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals but it was more than enough to help the Trail Blazers kick off the new year the right way. Lillard shook off a sluggish night to score five of his 25 points in overtime, and the Portland rallied after blowing a 14-point halftime lead to beat the Sacramento Kings 113-108 on Tuesday night. ""They outplayed us for most of the second half,"" a weary Lillard said. ""At that point you have to come together as a group and kind of forget about everything that's happened. You have to make plays happen from that point on to pull out a game and I thought we did a great job of that."" Jusuf Nurkic had 24 points and a career-high 23 rebounds to help Portland to its fourth straight win over Sacramento. CJ McCollum added 16 points, and Maurice Harkless had 11 points and nine rebounds. ""The effort it took to come back and win in overtime, I was really impressed with our guys,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""To make a comeback like that you have to be good at both ends, and we were."" Lillard wasn't much of a factor until late in the fourth quarter when he scored seven of Portland's final nine points, including a layup with 15.5 seconds remaining to force overtime. The Blazers dominated after that while outscoring the Kings 10-5 in the overtime. Lillard made three free throws and a 20-foot jumper to spark Portland's finish and erase an otherwise rough night shooting from its backcourt tandem of Lillard and McCollum. Lillard went 8 of 21 from the floor. McCollum shot 8 of 19. ""I woke up this morning feeling a little beat up, a little bit tired,"" Lillard said. ""But I've been a lot more sick."" Kings coach Dave Joerger said Lillard was the difference, especially down the stretch. ""He picks and chooses his spots of when he wants to go,"" Joerger said. ""He just went around people and shot layups."" Buddy Hield scored 27 points for Sacramento. Nemanja Bjelica added 14 points and 16 rebounds, and Bogdan Bogdanovic had 19 points. De'Aaron Fox had 13 points on 6 of 19 shooting and missed a jumper at the end of regulation. ""We just have to execute at the end of the game,"" Fox said. ""We had makeable shots and we just didn't make them."" Portland led by 64-50 at halftime and was up by seven entering the fourth before Sacramento went on a big run led by Bogdanovic. He scored 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter and scored all five of the Kings points in overtime. Hield made five 3s and had 19 points in the first half, but Seth Curry and Nurkic combined for 30 points before halftime. TIP-INS Blazers: Curry had a season-high 18 points on 6-of-9 shooting. ... Nurkic had a double-double by halftime. ... Harkless returned after sitting out against Philadelphia on Saturday because of a sore left knee. ... Portland had five turnovers in each of the first three quarters. Kings: Bogdanovic missed his first eight shots. ... Hield made five 3s. ... Cauley-Stein had five points and 11 rebounds. NURKIC'S BIG NIGHT Sacramento had no answer for Nurkic in the middle. Joerger was so frustrated that he benched 7-foot center Willie Cauley-Stein early in the first quarter after Nurkic had five points as part of a 10-3 run. Portland's big man also a good job getting to the line, making 14 of 16 free throws to go with five blocks, five steals and seven assists. ""Nurk's been on a role,"" Stotts said. ""Tonight may be probably the best game he's played as a Blazer. He did a little bit of everything.""","401071228"
"LOS ANGELES --  The energy was flowing late and that's just the way the Philadelphia 76ers like it. Joel Embiid notched his NBA-leading 32nd double-double of the season in his return and Philadelphia withstood a furious rally by the Los Angeles Clippers in a chippy fourth quarter for a 119-113 victory on Tuesday night to open the new year. ""The game was physical and I like it physical and aggressive,"" Embiid said. ""This was a huge win for us."" Embiid was a game-time decision after missing one game because of a sore left knee. He didn't appear hindered while recording 28 points and 19 rebounds. He scored 15 points in the first quarter, including 10 of the Sixers' final 16. ""My goal is to be dominant every game,"" Embiid said. ""If I dominate, the numbers will come, but most important is that we win."" He hit a 3-pointer early in the second, one of five by the Sixers in the period that propelled them to a 76-58 halftime lead. They built their largest lead of the game -- 24 points -- on a 3-pointer by Landry Shamet. ""Give Philly credit,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They were the instigator all game. They deserved to win. They played harder for longer."" The Clippers closed within four in the fourth on Montrezl Harrell's three-point play. He was rejected by Embiid but got the ball back and scored, drew the foul and made the free throw. But Embiid scored to keep the Sixers ahead 114-108. Lou Williams and Harrell combined to miss 3 of 4 free throws and Ben Simmons scored. Simmons punctuated the win with a huge dunk. Former Clipper JJ Redick added 18 points and Jimmy Butler scored 16 before being ejected to help Philadelphia improve to 8-11 on the road. Simmons just missed a triple-double with 14 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. ""I'd get (angry) if those guys were doing those things to me that they were doing to Jimmy and Joel,"" Simmons said. ""But we made key buckets down the stretch and played tough defense. I'm getting more comfortable with my jumper and our team is learning to play their roles and we're playing better together."" The Clippers outscored the Sixers 30-25 in the third and 25-18 in the fourth. ""We waited too long and had to fight and ran out of gas,"" Harrell said. Williams led the Clippers with 22 points off the bench. Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari finished with 21 points each and Harrell had 20 points and 10 rebounds. The Clippers alternated their two tallest players -- 7-foot Boban Marjanovic and 6-11 Marcin Gortat -- on Embiid, but he thwarted their effort by making 8 of 12 free throws. ""Every time we got physical with him it turned into a foul,"" Harrell said. Led by its bench, Los Angeles outscored the Sixers 30-25 in the third, closing with a 10-2 run, but still trailed 101-88 going into the fourth. That's when things got chippy. Embiid and Patrick Beverley received offsetting technicals at 9:32 after tangling. Embiid grabbed a rebound and Beverley yanked his jersey. Jonah Bolden pulled Beverley off Embiid in a mass of players. ""I was going for the ball and I got hit in the face and I freaked out because I got hit where I had surgery and I didn't want it to be re-injured,"" Embiid said. Avery Bradley and Butler got tied up going for a rebound and shoved each other. Referees and security were quick to come on the court and separate the players. They were each hit with technicals and ejected with 7:01 to play. ""We got too close to one another and the same things happen: some pushing, some shoving, some technical fouls and we got ejected,"" Butler said. TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons was cheered by model Kendall Jenner, who sat courtside. ... Embiid went over the 3,000-point mark in his career. ... They improved to 2-2 on their season-long five-game trip. ... G Markelle Fultz (thoracic outlet syndrome) is with the team while undergoing physical therapy, but there is no timetable for his return.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Luka Doncic and Dennis Smith Jr. fueled an early long-range shooting blitz and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Charlotte Hornets 122-84 on Wednesday night to end a nine-game road skid. Doncic and Smith each had 18 points, and Harrison Barnes added 17. The Mavericks hit 10 first-quarter 3-pointers -- three from Doncic and two from Smith -- and finished with 18 overall. Dallas won its first road game since Nov. 28. It entered the game with a NBA-worst 2-16 road record, compared to 15-3 at home. The Mavericks led 42-26 after the first quarter, and Charlotte got no closer than 18 the rest of the game. Dallas led by at least 20 points for the final 26 1/2 minutes. Dwight Powell scored 15 points, Wesley Matthews had 11, and DeAndre Jordan had eight points and 13 rebounds. Doncic added 10 rebounds and Smith seven assists, and the Mavericks didn't use any of their starters for more than 29 minutes in the game. Charlotte was led by Kemba Walker's 11 points. Walker made 4 of 14 shots and missed all five of his 3-point tries in 27 minutes. He was pulled with 3:15 left in the third quarter and didn't return. TIP INS: Mavericks: Fayetteville native Smith played one year at N.C. State and bought 25 tickets for Wednesday's game. He had many other friends and family in attendance in his lone trip to his home state. He was one of three Mavericks with local ties; Barnes played at North Carolina, and 11th-year Dallas assistant coach Darrell Armstrong is a Gastonia native who played at Fayetteville State.

Walker and Devonte Graham opened at guard, Nic Batum and Marvin Williams at forward and Willy Hernangomez at center. Graham, a 2018 second-round pick out of Kansas, made his first career start.","401071230"
"CLEVELAND --  Dwyane Wade's absence was no problem for the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. With Wade sitting out because of an illness, Josh Richardson led seven players in double figures with 24 points and Miami rolled past the Cleveland Cavaliers 117-92. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra wasn't surprised so many players made key contributions without their third-leading scorer. ""One of our biggest strengths is our depth and versatility,"" he said. ""We should be a team with 7-8 guys in double figures every night. It shows we have a lot of guys that can hurt you."" Miami hit 16 of 31 3-pointers. Tyler Johnson added 16 points, and Derrick Jones Jr. had 13. The Heat have won seven of nine to reach the .500 mark at 18-18. ""Everyone was just kind of in a groove,"" Richardson said. ""I was taking what the defense was giving me, but yeah, I was feeling it."" Cleveland dropped to 8-30 -- the worst record in the NBA -- with its season-worst seventh straight loss. Cavaliers coach Larry Drew believes his team must show more toughness physically and mentally. ""We've got to be grimy as far as our style of play,"" he said. ""We can't play cute. We can't play pretty. We've got to get on the floor for loose balls. We've got to get our body on people when they go in (the lane). We've got to do all the little things, which add up to be big things."" Tristan Thompson and Rodney Hood returned from injuries and started for the Cavaliers, but it mattered little in their ninth loss in 10 games. Thompson had 14 points, and Hood added 13. The Heat grabbed control in the second quarter, turning a one-point deficit into a 17-point lead. Jones scored 11 points in the period while Dion Waiters, playing in his first game in over a year, had seven points in six minutes. ""I was just really excited to get back,"" Waiters said. It was nice -- all the hard work you put in -- to have those shots fall, it felt good. I had fun."" Miami outrebounded Cleveland 25-9 in the first half. Heat center Hassan Whiteside had nine boards, matching the Cavaliers' total for the first two quarters. Cleveland led 30-29 early in the second when Miami took over. The Heat hit six 3-pointers in the quarter, including three by Jones. Waiters added a 30-footer while Richardson and Tyler Johnson also hit from beyond the arc. Miami led 58-43 at halftime and continued to pad the margin. Whiteside scored on an alley-oop from James Johnson, who added a pair of 3-pointers. Richardson's 3-pointer at the buzzer pushed the lead to 93-73. The Heat can move over .500 for the first time since they were 3-2 with a win over Washington at home Friday. NIGHT OFF Wade is averaging 14.1 points in 27 games in his 16thand final season. He played in 46 games last season with Cleveland, where he was reunited with LeBron James, before being traded to Miami. Wade is one 3-pointer shy of 500 for his career. SHOOTING AROUND Drew said forward Kevin Love, who had surgery on his left foot in November, has begun shooting drills, but has yet to practice. The team doesn't have a definitive timeline for when Love will return, but it's hoped he's back later in the month. Drew said Love will visit a doctor soon as he continues to rehab his injury. BIG MARGIN Miami ended the game with a 47-22 rebounding advantage with Whiteside grabbing a game-high 12. ""We knew we had to be a little more vigilant, and we have been the last few games,"" Spoelstra said. ""We were able to do that again tonight.""

Wall, scheduled for surgery on his left heel Jan. 8, hasn't played in any of the past three games but the Wizards have won the last two. ""We all have to be better,"" Beal said. ""We know how much weight he carries, and his importance to this franchise and this team. We're definitely going to miss him. We hate that he's out.

As a result, Satoransky doesn't feel the pressure he did a year ago. ""I maybe felt like that last year because it was an uncertain situation for me,"" he said. ""Now, I know my role. People know me.

"Anthony Davis says the Pelicans can't feel sorry for themselves after falling to 17-22 on the season. (0:24) NEW YORK --  The Nets piled on the points in the first half like never before in Brooklyn, and it turned out they needed almost all of them. Anthony Davis was that tough to stop in a monstrous return to the lineup. D'Angelo Russell had 22 points and 13 assists, and the Nets built up a big enough lead with a 73-point first half to hold off Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans, 126-121 on Wednesday night. Davis finished with 34 points and a career-high 26 rebounds after a one-game absence, but there weren't enough rebounds to get in the first half, when the Nets opened a 24-point lead during their highest-scoring first half at home in 17 years. ""Man, when you got a guy like Anthony Davis down there, it's tough for us on the defensive end, it's tough for us on the offensive end,"" Russell said. ""You've just got to keep playing next play at a time mentality and just being aggressive on all cylinders."" Joe Harris added 21 points for the Nets, who had 105 points through three quarters, then got consecutive baskets by Harris when New Orleans trimmed the lead down to seven with under 5 minutes remaining. The Nets made nine of their first 15 3-point attempts during their highest-scoring first half at home since getting 75 against Golden State on Feb. 19, 2002, back in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Davis said the Pelicans' first-half defense was lazy. ""The whole first half they did whatever they wanted,"" he said. ""They didn't feel us on the defensive end."" Despite playing without injured Caris LeVert, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Allen Crabbe, the Nets won for the seventh time in their last eight home games. They finished with seven players in double figures, with DeMarre Carroll (19) and Spencer Dinwiddie (18) leading a bench effort that had a whopping 55-5 advantage over the New Orleans reserves. ""Losing Caris and Allen Crabbe and Rondae, I just think we're a deeper squad and we're a better squad. But we have a tough road ahead here, especially short-handed,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""If we can weather the storm I think until we're fully healthy, maybe we can do something important."" Elfrid Payton scored 25 points for New Orleans in his second game back after missing more than a month with a broken finger. Julius Randle had 21 and Jrue Holiday 20, but the Pelicans got next to nothing from their bench. The Nets were ahead 39-29 after one and scored the first seven of the second quarter, going ahead 46-29 on Carroll's 3-pointer. He added another almost two minutes later for a 20-point bulge, and the lead grew to 24 points later in the quarter. The Pelicans rallied with 12 straight points to cut the lead in half, and Brooklyn was ahead 73-58 at the break. Brooklyn led by 18 after three before New Orleans closed within five after a late flurry. ""We got behind and you're playing uphill,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We know this story. We've seen this story before."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Gentry said Davis' absence in their victory over Minnesota on Monday came after the All-Star forward caught an illness from his young daughter. ... Davis' previous career best was 22 rebounds. Nets: Brooklyn's reserves outscored New Orleans' 39-5 in the first half. ... The Nets are 6-1 in their first game of the new year since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. CRABBE SETBACK Crabbe will be out at least another week because of his sore right knee. Atkinson said last week that Crabbe was nearing a return but the team announced Wednesday that Crabbe's bruised fat pad, which caused the soreness, needed additional recovery time. Crabbe will be re-evaluated in approximately 10 days. He missed his 10th straight game Wednesday. WILLIAMS WAIVED The Nets waived forward/center Alan Williams, who had been playing on a two-way contract. Williams was averaging 21 points and a league-leading 14.7 rebounds for the Long Island Nets but didn't appear in a game for Brooklyn. Atkinson said Williams had an excellent opportunity elsewhere so the Nets cut him so he could pursue that.","401071233"

In all, he was 4 for 4 in the second quarter and 7 of 8 in the third. ""He was disappointed in how he shot the ball, obviously, in San Antonio and got back in the gym this morning. And you could tell he was going to play pretty well,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after Hayward came off the bench to score a season-high 35 points and lead Boston to a 115-102 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. ""I mean, 14 for 18 is an unbelievable night, and you're not always going to shoot it like that,"" Stevens said. ""But you could tell he was pretty locked in."" Terry Rozier scored 11 of his 16 points in the first quarter while making his third start of the season because Kyrie Irving scratched both of his eyes in Monday's game against San Antonio. Hayward took over from there in his highest scoring game with the Celtics. ""Gordon's a good player, and we gave him basically whatever he wanted,"" said Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who saw Hayward score 30 a month ago when the teams met in Minneapolis. ""When you do that in this league, they're going to make you pay."" Andrew Wiggins scored 31 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 20 of his 28 points -- and grabbed five of his 12 rebounds -- in the third quarter, when Minnesota trimmed a 22-point deficit to six points. It was an 11-point game with 4:53 left before the Celtics went on an 8-0 run to clinch their fifth straight win over the Wolves. HAYWARD'S HISTORY Hayward missed all but five minutes of last season with a broken leg and has been coming off the bench the last six weeks as Stevens tries to figure out a rotation. On Monday night against the Spurs, Hayward had his only scoreless game of the season. After missing his first two shots on Wednesday, Hayward didn't stop shooting. ""Didn't start that great ... but Marcus Smart got me open for a 3 that got me going a little bit,"" he said. ""Anytime you have a game like I did last game, you want to try to come out ultra-aggressive."" FIGHT CLUB Towns said the problem was the team's failure to maintain a consistent focus, comparing the sport to boxing. ""Boxing is such a great sport,"" he said. ""Those guys have to be focused every single second of every single round. We have to be focused; we have to think of ourselves like boxing. We have to make sure every single second we are tremendously focused."" EARLY LEAD Minnesota scored nine of the last 11 points in the first quarter to trim Boston's 11-point lead to 25-21, and then opened the second with a step-back jumper from Wiggins. It was a four-point game when Boston ran off 16 points in a row to take a 47-27 lead. Boston led by as many as 22 in the third quarter before Towns scored 15 points during a 23-11 Minnesota run that cut the deficit to 10. He added five more in the final 90 seconds of the third to make it a six-point game. QUICK BREAK Thibodeau called a timeout just 64 seconds into the game to settle his team down after giving up two quick baskets. ""The start of the game was poor,"" he explained. ""You start off a game like that, give them a little confidence, it's hard to slow them down."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: The last time Minnesota won in Boston was March 6, 2005. Kevin Garnett was a starter in his first stint with the Wolves. Ricky Davis led the Celtics with 22 points. ... Robert Covington (right knee injury), Derrick Rose (right ankle sprain) and Jeff Teague (left ankle inflammation) were sidelined by injuries. Celtics: Improved to 2-1 with Rozier starting. ... Even without Irving, the Celtics set a season high with 34 assists ... In addition to Irving, the Celtics were missing big man Aron Baynes, who missed his seventh straight game with a broken left hand. ... The Celtics returned home after a 1-2 road trip to Texas and Memphis. They play four straight and 15 of 19 games at home in January and don't leave the Eastern time zone until Feb. 21. THAT SMARTS Smart left in obvious pain after absorbing a pick from Towns early in the second half. He walked over by the Celtics bench with his right arm dangling at his side. After Stevens called a timeout, Smart was ushered by the training staff into the tunnel to the locker room. But Smart was back with about four minutes left in the quarter, getting a big cheer when he rejoined his teammates on the bench. He re-entered the game late in the third and finished with two points and eight assists. The Celtics said it was a right shoulder strain. Marcus Morris Sr. left the game in the third quarter with a sore neck and did not return.","401071234"
"CHICAGO --  Nikola Vucevic and the Orlando Magic had no trouble finding motivation Wednesday night. A loss in Chicago less than two weeks ago and a blowout defeat only two days ago was all the incentive they needed. Vucevic had 22 points and 12 rebounds before sitting out the fourth quarter, Aaron Gordon added 18 points and a career-high nine assists, and the Magic led the entire way in a 112-84 rout of the Chicago Bulls. Terrence Ross scored 15 off the bench and Evan Fournier had 13 points and seven assists for Orlando, which has won three of four. The Magic shot 58 percent from the field and had 31 assists on 44 field goals. Orlando coach Steve Clifford sensed a special performance was coming at the morning shootaround. ""When we walked out, I told a couple of the coaches, `I don't know if we're going to win, but we're going to play well,"" Clifford said. ""We were very focused in the shootaround and you could tell we were going to have great energy."" Zach LaVine had 16 points while Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn added 14 apiece for Chicago, which has dropped two straight after winning three of four. ""I can't imagine what it looked like on TV -- it felt even worse in the game,"" LaVine said. ""I can't figure that out. We have to try to figure that out on our own."" It was the third game between the teams since Dec. 13. The Magic have won two, including 97-91 in Mexico City. Chicago held Orlando to 80 points in a 10-point win Dec. 21 when the teams met at the United Center. It was the Magic's second-lowest point total of the season, but it was apparent early on things would be different this time. Orlando charged out to a 32-16 advantage after the first quarter and took a 62-45 halftime lead. Gordon and Ross led the way with 12 first-half points apiece on 11-for-15 combined shooting. Vucevic added 11 points on 5-of-7 shooting. The Magic were 25 for 39 (64 percent) from the floor in the first half, including 7 of 12 on 3-pointers. Things didn't get any better for Chicago. The Magic started the third quarter with 11 straight points to stretch the margin to 73-45. Orlando's advantage was 90-62 entering the fourth period behind Vucevic's 11 points in the third. The closest Chicago got in the fourth was 94-71. It was a far cry from its 125-100 loss Monday at Charlotte. ""The guys were disappointed with the way we played in Charlotte,"" Clifford said. ""That's the best all-around game we've played in a while. The ball movement was good, and I thought, for the most part, our defense was really good."" TIP-INS Magic: G D.J. Augustin (sprained right ankle) returned after missing the previous game. He had 10 points in 25 minutes. ... Timofey Mozgov (sore right knee) and Jonathon Simmons (sprained left ankle) didn't play. Bulls: F Bobby Portis (sprained right ankle) missed his sixth straight game but is close to returning. ""We're hoping he responds well to today's workout and has a contact practice (Thursday),"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""We'll see how that goes."" STUFFING THE STAT SHEET Had the game been closer, Gordon, who had seven rebounds, might have been able to get his first career triple-double. Instead, he sat out the final four minutes. ""That's cool,"" he said. ""I'm not going to chase stats."" ROOKIE WALL? Chicago rookie Wendell Carter Jr. was scoreless (0 for 5) with one rebound in 13 minutes. ""I didn't come out with the correct edge for myself,"" Carter said. ""I've just got to bring out a better edge every time we play."" COAST TO COAST This was the second of a six-game, 10-day road trip in which Orlando will play in all four time zones in the continental United States. ""The next four games are going to be really hard,"" Fournier said. ""Tonight was really great for us and hopefully it gives us confidence.""","401071235"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  In the closing minutes of a four-game trip, the Detroit Pistons had enough energy to end the journey on a good note. With a 13-0 run in the fourth quarter, the Pistons built a double-digit lead and snapped their three-game losing streak with a 101-94 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. Memphis has lost tree in a row and 10 of the last 13, leading to a lengthy postgame meeting in a closed locker room. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff took more than 30 minutes to emerge and address the media. Then, it was even longer before the locker room opened, by then occupied only by team leaders Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. ""A conversation that needed to be had that will stay between those of us that were in that locker room,"" Bickerstaff said about the session. Blake Griffin led Detroit with 26 points, eight rebounds and seven assists as six Pistons reached double-figures in scoring. Reggie Jackson had 16 points, while Reggie Bullock and Luke Kennard added 13 each. For the Pistons, the night was a relief from a stretch where they had lost five of their last six and were 3-12 over the previous 15. Not to mention, they were on the second night of a back-to-back after a loss in Milwaukee on Monday. ""When that win is within reach you know, you get a little extra boost,"" Griffin said of playing down the stretch. Griffin was the one who closed out the rally, scoring the final five points. Kennard started the stretch with a pair of 3-pointers. ""We got stops. We were able to push the ball, and we just got good shots as well,"" Kennard said of the 13-0 rally. ""(Defense) allowed us to create that lead, and we just kind of stuck with it."" The Pistons trailed 55-51 at the half, but holding Memphis to 12 points in the third quarter contributed to the Detroit comeback. Memphis was 3 of 17 in the frame and had four turnovers. The Grizzlies chipped into the Pistons advantage, pulling within 83-82 near the midway point of the fourth. That's when the Pistons clicked off the 13 straight points, ending the Memphis hopes. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Kyle Anderson scored 15 points. Dillon Brooks finished with 14 points off the bench for Memphis. The lengthy postgame delay was the focus of the discussion on the Memphis side. Bickerstaff shared little during his comments. ""Again, the conversation that we had was a good conversation,"" the Memphis coach said, ""and it wasn't just (team leaders Gasol and Conley). Guys are willing to address the issues and willing to fix them."" TIP-INS Pistons: C Zaza Pachulia missed his second straight game with a right lower leg contusion. F Stanley Johnson was questionable with a left thigh contusion and played almost six minutes. ... Kennard has four straight games of multiple 3-pointers. ... Jackson made a 3-pointer with 4:18 left in the third quarter, his fourth of the game and 500th of his career. Grizzlies: Gasol has made a 3-pointer in 14 straight games, eclipsing the longest such streak of his career in December of 2017. ... Memphis (18-19) dropped below .500 for the first time since losing its season opener. .The 12 points in the third were a season-low for scoring in a third quarter. .Jaren Jackson Jr. recorded his second double-double of the season. ... Anderson has reached double figures in eight of the last nine. INJURED CONLEY SCORELESS Memphis point guard Mike Conley, the team's leading scorer at 20.5 points a game, was held scoreless, missing all eight of his shots. Conley was hindered by a sore left shoulder suffered in the first quarter when he got tangled with Pistons center Andre Drummond on a rebound. ""All my strength is good, it just got to where my mobility wasn't there,"" Conley said. It marked the first time Conley was held scoreless since Dec. 8, 2015, against Oklahoma City when he played 22 minutes.","401071236"
"PHOENIX --  The Philadelphia 76ers were ready to go home from their trip west a little too early, and it almost cost them. Joel Embiid, playing despite a sore left knee, matched his season high with 42 points, 30 in the first half, and grabbed 18 rebounds and the Philadelphia 76ers blew most of a 30-point lead before holding on to beat the Phoenix Suns 132-127 on Wednesday night. Ben Simmons added 29 points and J.J. Redick 27 for the 76ers, They were without Jimmy Butler and Wilson Chandler, both due to an upper respiratory infection. Devin Booker scored 37 points for the Suns. Deandre Ayton added 18 points and 11 boards, and Josh Jackson scored 16 points. ""I think we left Dec. 24 and now we're ready to go home,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""It didn't really end as authoritative as we'd hoped."" Philadelphia led by 23 at halftime and as many as 30 in the third quarter. The Suns cut it to three points before Redick finally sealed the victory with a pair of free throws with 4.3 seconds to play. ""We love to make the game interesting,"" Embiid said. ""We've done it a lot, but give credit to Phoenix. They hit a lot of 3s in the third quarter and they got back in the game. It was a fun game but we have to make sure next time we need to finish and push the lead even further."" The 76ers shot out to a 13-3 lead and consecutive 3-points by Redick made it 21-8. The 76ers led 44-32 after one, matching the most point allowed by the Suns in any quarter this season. Embiid scored 10 points as Philadelphia opened the second quarter with a 13-2 run to lead 58-36 and the margin barely changed the rest of the one-sided half and the 76ers led 72-49 at the break. Embiid made 8 of 14 shots, 14 of 16 free throws and grabbed 14 rebounds in the first half. ""Now eight of those types of first halves (for Embiid) this year,"" Brown said, ""just incredibly dominant."" Phoenix finished the third quarter on a 13-2 run. Troy Daniels sank a pair of 3s and Ellie Okobo added another after a Philadelphia turnover cut the lead to 104-87 after three. A 19-5 Suns run reduced the lead to 116-110 when Jackson scored on a lob pass from Booker with 3:24 to go. Furkan Korkmaz sank a 3-pointer, Phoenix turned it over and Embiid's dunk boosted it to 121-110. Booker's 3-pointer cut the lead to 129-125 with 14.3 seconds, Redick made one of two free throws and Booker scored on a put-back to make it 130-127. Redick put it out of reach with his two final shots from the line. ""I think we played with them too much,"" Simmons said. ""We were playing around with them too much. The energy wasn't there. Guys were ready to go home."" Slow starts have been a problem for the Suns twice on their current home stand and often during the season. ""As a team, we all just have to come out strong, just come out aggressive throwing the first punch,"" Ayton said. ""There's a really small margin of error to play against great teams like this so it's pretty hard to mess up and have silly mistakes against teams, and they'll make you pay."" TIP INS 76ers: Embiid's career high is 46 set last season. He scored 42 against Charlotte on Nov. 9. ...  Philadelphia wrapped up a 3-2 trip. ... 76ers shot 77 percent in the first quarter (13-of-17), including 4-of-5 3s. ... Embiid was 17 of 19 from the line.

"LOS ANGELES --  Paul George got booed last season in Indianapolis because he left. He got booed by Lakers fans on Wednesday night because he never arrived. The Oklahoma City star learned from the first experience and translated it into a performance that quieted Staples Center. George scored 37 points while getting jeered whenever he touched the ball by Lakers fans still angry he didn't choose their team in free agency, leading the Thunder to a 107-100 victory over Los Angeles. Russell Westbrook had 14 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists despite 3-for-20 shooting, but his fellow Southern California native was the center of attention in the Thunder's only visit to the Lakers this season. ""I was prepared for it,"" George said. ""I'm the bad guy, and that's fine."" The boos started in pregame introductions for George, whose perceived crime is his decision to re-sign quickly with Oklahoma City when he became a free agent last summer despite years of mutual interest between the scoring sensation and the Lakers. George grew up idolizing Kobe Bryant while rooting for both the Lakers and Clippers in Palmdale, California, on the far-flung edge of Los Angeles suburbia. Yet he didn't even deign to meet with the Lakers about a return to his home state after years of hopeful speculation by Lakers fans and Magic Johnson, who wanted to team LeBron James with George. ""I'm not the only guy from SoCal, the LA area, that didn't decide to play here,"" George said. ""You can go down the whole list of guys from this beautiful city. It is what it is. The decision has been made. No ill will."" At least not on George's part -- but he got the last laugh on his haters despite struggling with early foul trouble. After collecting 13 points in the second quarter and 11 more in the third, George scored nine points in the fourth while the Thunder rallied from a five-point deficit and easily held on for their seventh win in 10 games. ""I feel like every game is important to him, so I don't want to say that he was extra amped up for this game,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""Obviously the Lakers have great history, great tradition. It's a great place to play, great environment ... but as it relates to his personal feelings, I think he's probably best to answer that."" When George returned to face the Pacers on Dec. 13, 2017, he managed just 12 points on 3-of-14 shooting amid scathing boos. He had been traded five months earlier after seven seasons with the Pacers, who shipped him to Oklahoma City instead of the Lakers, widely thought to be his preferred destination. ""I thought I handled it better tonight, given I've been in that situation before in Indy now,"" George said. ""It was just being locked, being ready. In Indy, I expected to be booed, but I didn't know to what extent. Here, coming into this situation, I knew what to expect."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 18 of his 25 points in the first half for the Lakers, who dropped to 1/3 during James' absence with a groin injury. Los Angeles has lost six of nine after managing just six field goals in the fourth quarter, along with the Lakers' usual awful free-throw shooting. George struggled with his outside shooting, going 2 of 11 from beyond the arc, but otherwise carved up the Lakers' perimeter defense. George and the Thunder appeared to draw motivation from the booing: George got a technical foul for slapping the backboard after slamming an alley-oop from Westbrook, who mimicked Lakers guard Lance Stephenson's air guitar celebration moments later when George drew a foul from Stephenson while hitting a jumper. ""It was fun,"" George said. ""The booing wasn't going to throw me off my game. I've been playing basketball for a really long time. A little booing and a little noise wasn't going to make me forget how to play basketball."" Some Lakers fans still chanted ""We don't need you!"" at George in the fourth quarter while he sewed up the win. ""I thought the effort and competitive level was top-notch for us,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We were getting good looks. We just weren't making them."" TIP-INS Thunder: Spanish guard Alex Abrines missed his fifth consecutive game for personal reasons. ... The Thunder host the Lakers on Jan. 17. Lakers: Rajon Rondo also missed his fourth straight game and watched from the bench. The veteran point guard won't be back from hand surgery for a month. ... Michael Beasley missed his 13th consecutive game. BIG NUMBERS Westbrook recorded his 115th career triple-double despite his horrific shooting, which included a 1-of-7 showing on 3-pointers. Westbrook still has 11 triple-doubles this season and eight in his last 15 games. AILING LAKERS James watched from the Lakers' bench in street clothes. The four-time NBA MVP has resumed shooting, but Walton still isn't guessing how long he will be out. Kyle Kuzma also sat out the second half for the Lakers with a bruised lower back. He will have an MRI exam Thursday.","401071238"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs' suffocating defense, scoring runs and fans' unrelenting contempt for the opposing team's star player have often overwhelmed the opposition. Kawhi Leonard has seen it many times in San Antonio, but the Toronto star never experienced it from the opposing bench until Thursday night. It was worse than he expected. DeMar DeRozan 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for first career triple-double and San Antonio welcomed back Leonard with thunderous jeers in the Spurs' 125-107 victory over the Raptors. ""You've got to thrive in moments like that,"" DeRozan said. ""You've got to love to play in that type of atmosphere, whether it's at home or on the road. It kind of fuels you, kind of gets you going. That's what made it so fun."" It wasn't much fun for Leonard and the Raptors, who saw a three-game winning streak snapped in inglorious fashion. Leonard scored 21 points on 8-for-13 shooting, but the anger the Spurs' fans showered on him seemed to impact the MVP candidate. Leonard had to take a step back at the free throw line and compose himself amid chants of ""Traitor! Traitor!"" and ""Quitter! Quitter!"" from the capacity crowd that adored him during his seven seasons in San Antonio. The reception didn't surprise Leonard. ""No,"" Leonard said. ""Media does a great mind to stir people's minds and to influence them to think a certain way. So, I already knew how that was going to be the way the media was."" Fans were angry that Leonard forced his way out of San Antonio this offseason in a trade that yielded DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl from Toronto for him and Danny Green. Leonard was booed heavily from the moment he walked onto the court for warmup. The boos continued during a pregame video tribute and player introductions, whenever he touched the ball and as he walked off the court following the lopsided loss. ""I felt badly about it,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Kawhi's a high-character guy. We all make decisions in our lives about what we're going to do with our futures and he has that same right as any of us. So, I felt badly, honestly."" The Spurs gave reason for the fans to constantly cheer, leading by as many as 28 points against a Raptors team that has been atop the Eastern Conference for much of the season. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points for San Antonio, Bryn Forbes added 20, Derrick White 19 and Rudy Gay 13. ""Yeah it was a different kind of game, it was more of a playoff atmosphere, but that's what we live for,"" Gay said. ""It's the NBA, you're going to have times like this, those are times you have to step up."" The night belonged to DeRozan, though, as he became the first San Antonio player with a triple-double at home since Tim Duncan in 2003. ""I told him it was about time,"" Popovich said. DeRozan shot 7 for 15 from the field, collecting 13 defensive rebounds and finishing with just three turnovers in 33 minutes. DeRozan's 10th assist came on an entry to Aldridge that the Spurs center punctuated with a celebration in honor of his teammate's career milestone. ""He was in high gear tonight,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""He was in his fast, athletic gear tonight and when he's in that gear, he's tough to handle, as we all know."" After leading by as many as 26 points in the first half, San Antonio opened the second half on a 12-0 run to take a 79-51 lead. The crowd erupted during a sequence of plays when Leonard had the ball tipped away, which led to a slam dunk by White. That possession was followed by Leonard being unable to corral an alley-oop pass, which led to DeRozan tossing in a runner and being fouled by Serge Ibaka. DeRozan made the free throw amid chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" -- something Leonard heard during his time in San Antonio. ""We didn't do a good job in transition, defense,"" Leonard said. ""We didn't play well at all defensively. Spurs did a great job pushing the pace and kicking out for wide-open shots."" As the game ended, Popovich and Leonard embraced in a long hug and the Spurs coach led his former star to San Antonio's bench to greet assistant coach Ettore Messina. TIP-INS Raptors: The Spurs played a tribute video for Leonard and Green prior to the game that ended with ""Thank you Danny and Kawhi."" Green ran over to and hugged Popovich prior to tipoff. Green finished with no points on 0-for-7 shooting. ... Lowry missed his fourth straight game due to lower back pain. Spurs: DeRozan is the first Spurs player to have at least 15 points 10 rebounds and five assists in a half since Tim Duncan in 2007. DeRozan also recorded his first double-double in a half. ... Gay played 23 minutes to Popovich's surprise, who thought the 13-year veteran would miss the game with a sprained left wrist.","401071239"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  After watching the Sacramento Kings run off 66 first-half points, the Denver Nuggets focused on defense in the second half and let Jamal Murray take care of the rest. Murray scored 17 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter and the Nuggets beat the Kings 117-113 on Thursday night for their fourth straight win. ""Before halftime, they were getting everything they wanted, on transition, on the glass, and we turned the ball over. All the things we prioritized before the game, we didn't do in that first half,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""But love the effort to start that third quarter ...  and get right back into the game. Then, obviously, Jamal went into the phone booth and came out like Superman in the second half."" Nikola Jokic had 26 points and 13 rebounds, and the Nuggets maintained their lead atop the Western Conference by winning for the eighth time in 10 games. Mason Plumlee added 12 points and 10 rebounds for Denver, which outrebounded the Kings 54-33. ""I just thought we really responded at halftime. We realized we didn't play much defense in the first half,"" Plumlee said. ""I just think we took away their rhythm (in the second half), they were very comfortable in the first half."" Buddy Hield had 29 points to lead the Kings, who have lost three straight. The Kings held a 13-point lead at the half and were ahead 70-55 early in the third period when Murray scored eight straight points -- including a pair of 3-pointers -- to lead a 13-point Denver run. The Nuggets took the lead later in the period, and the game was tied 84-84 entering the fourth. Murray hit a 3-pointer to open the final period, and the Nuggets never trailed again. They built a 10-point lead with six minutes remaining, but Hield made three straight 3-pointers to keep Sacramento close. The Kings pulled within 108-106 with 1:25 left before Murray made consecutive 3-pointers for the Nuggets. ""I just wanted to pick up our energy in the second half,"" Murray said. ""In the first half, we gave into everything they were doing. In the second half, we came out with a different energy and I tried to get my guys to start talking more and be more vocal. We all gang rebounded and came together on the defensive end."" Sacramento fell to .500 at 19-19, better than most prognosticators had predicted before the season but disappointing for a team that has now lost four of five. ""I'm trying to keep our guys very positive at this point,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""I'm very proud of our group and the effort that we're giving and the learning that is happening because of competition."" SERBIAN TRIO Bjelica and Jokic, both natives of Serbia, had big first quarters. Bjelica scored 12 of the Kings' 30 points in the period, and Jokic had 10 of the Nuggets' 30 points in the quarter. And then their compatriot, Sacramento's Bogdan Bogdanovic, scored the first six points of the second quarter and led all scorers with 11 points in the period. He finished with 14 points off the bench for the Kings. TIP-INS Nuggets: Murray was 6 for 12 on 3-pointers. ... Denver outrebounded the Kings 54-33. ... Denver coach Michael Malone was the Kings' coach from 2013-15. Kings: Nemanja Bjelica had 17 points, but only five after the first quarter. ... DeAaron Fox had 16 points and eight assists. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  A defender on either side of him, James Harden let it fly one last time for an improbable game-winner in the waning seconds of overtime before falling backward and hitting the floor. It took his second triple-double of the week, fifth straight 40-point performance and sheer will to rally the Houston Rockets past the Golden State Warriors 135-134 in a thriller between Western Conference powers Thursday night for their sixth straight victory. Harden hit a contested 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left in OT and finished with 44 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. The reigning MVP's team had trailed by 20. ""I take my shots, I drive to the basket,"" Harden said. ""I shoot my step-backs with confidence and live with the results."" Kevin Durant's long 3-pointer missed as the buzzer sounded in what will go down as one of the best games this regular season -- a rematch of the seven-game Western Conference finals won by two-time defending champion Golden State. Stephen Curry put the Warriors ahead with 23.1 seconds remaining in OT on the way to 35 points, a basket that shouldn't have counted because Durant was clearly out of bounds when he flung the ball back in. Durant said he knew it, too, and ""I could believe it because the refs were missing a lot tonight."" Harden, however, had one more incredible, acrobatic moment still in him. He released the ball swarmed by two defenders -- Klay Thompson to his left and Draymond Green in front of him. Harden also hit 3-pointers at the 3:52 and 2:02 marks of OT in a game featuring dazzling displays on both ends by some of the game's biggest stars. ""I don't know where it ranks but I'm just happy to come away with the win,"" Harden said. ""I just had to go out and do my part on the highest level."" Thompson made a go-ahead layup with 40.6 seconds left in the extra period, then Harden tied it at 132 on a pair of free throws with 33.5 seconds left. ""He just did what he does,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's the master of the isolation, the step-back 3 and drawing fouls."" Durant added 26 points and seven rebounds. Harden also had a triple-double Monday against Memphis of 43 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists, but he was disappointed with nine turnovers he thought gave the Grizzlies too many transition opportunities. Including his 50-point game Dec. 13 against the Lakers, Harden has scored at least 30 in 11 straight. Clint Capela contributed 29 points and 21 rebounds for Houston. Kerr's simple message about defending Harden, who went to the line 27 times Monday: ""Don't foul him!"" Harden shot five free throws in the first quarter Thursday and nine in all. His jumper with 5:37 left in regulation cut Golden State's lead to 112-111. He also got the Rockets close by knocking down two 3-pointers and assisting on another basket in the final 1:26 of the third as Houston cut its deficit to 98-92 going into the final quarter. ""We had a 20-point lead and lost. It doesn't really matter what happened at that point,"" Green said. Thompson scored 26 points and hit consecutive 3-pointers late in the first half. After struggling to find his stroke from deep, Thompson is 10 for 17 on 3-pointers the past three games. With his first 3 at the 7-minute mark of the opening period, Durant became the 32nd player in NBA history to reach 22,000 points. Falling backward as he released the ball over Harden, Durant swished a 3 with 59.2 seconds left in the first half. The cold-shooting Rockets fell behind 70-53 at halftime. Houston was just 6 of 23 from long range, 3 for 9 by Harden, while the Warriors shot 62.8 percent. ""I don't think we played with that killer instinct in the second half,"" Thompson said. ""I think we relaxed up 17 points."" TIP-INS Rockets: F James Ennis, who had been questionable with a strained right hamstring, returned after missing the previous 10 games. ... G Eric Gordon sat out a second straight game with a bruised right knee. Warriors: C Kevon Looney scored in double figures for the ninth time this season. ... Durant is one of six active players in the 22,000-point club, joining LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Dwyane Wade. ... Durant has 12 straight games with 20 or more points. ... Golden State dropped to 10-3 when dishing out 30 or more assists. RUN TMC As part of the final season at Oracle Arena, the Warriors honored the ""Run TMC"" era featuring the trio of Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin. They were recognized on the big screen during a first-quarter timeout and Hardaway was shown sitting courtside next to Warriors owner Joe Lacob.","401071241"
"BOSTON --  Gordon Hayward followed up his top scoring game of the season with his best overall performance since coming to the Boston Celtics. Gordon Hayward had 16 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists for the short-handed Celtics in a 114-93 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. ""It was fun,"" said Hayward, who was coming off a season-high 35 points Wednesday night in a victory over Minnesota. ""I think when we have good spacing, we have talented players and it just makes the game easier. If you make the right read, everybody gets involved and it's fun."" Jaylen Brown scored 21 points, Jayson Tatum added 18 points, and Al Horford had 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The Celtics won easily despite playing their second straight game with star guard Kyrie Irving sidelined by scratched corneas. Without Irving, the Celtics moved the ball around and had 35 assists on 42 field goals. Hayward and Horford had eight apiece and Terry Rozier, who started for Irving, added seven assists for the Celtics. ""We've really tried to emphasize that all year,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""For the most part everybody was in a good rhythm and playing well together and seeking out the right shot. We've just got to keep doing that as much as possible."" Luka Doncic had 19 points and nine assists for Dallas. Harrison Barnes scored 20 points, and DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 15 rebounds. FOND FAREWELL? Dirk Nowitzki, who received two standing ovations, was scoreless and had two rebounds for Dallas. Celtics fans chanted ""Dirk! Dirk!"" in the final minute, hoping he would make a shot in what might have been his final appearance in Boston. ""It's sweet when not only your home fans, but fans on the road appreciate what you've done for the last two decades,"" Nowitzki said after going 0 for 10. ""I appreciate the fans of Boston. Unfortunately, I'm really disappointed I couldn't even make one. I had some great looks."" Nowitzki said he hasn't made up his mind about a 22nd season, but was grateful to Boston's fans for the sendoff they gave him if Friday was it. ""They're great sports fans. It's a great sports town. They know the game and they appreciate the game,"" Nowitzki said. DOUBLE TIME Hayward was flirting with his first career triple-double before going to the bench midway through the fourth quarter with Boston up by 22. Hayward said he's never had a triple-double, but has thought about it. ""I'm big enough to see over the defense and make skip passes and those type of things. It's something I've been working on,"" Hayward said. ""It's a little bit of a different role. I've always enjoyed making plays for others more than for myself. I like getting assists."" Hayward, who missed all but a few minutes of last season after breaking his leg in the season opener, started the week with his only scoreless game of the season. ""It's good to see him getting back to his movement and looking like his old self, and being more consistent,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ROAD WOES Dallas, which ended a nine-game road losing skid Wednesday with a victory at Charlotte, fell to 3-14 on the road. The Mavs committed six of their 14 turnovers in the first quarter and never recovered. ""The early turnovers were a big problem. It got us behind the eight-ball early,"" Carlisle said. ""Then you're  playing from behind all night. They took advantage of it."" The Mavericks trimmed an 18-point first-half deficit to a point early in the third quarter, but could get no closer. The Mavericks had a 13-0 run late in the second quarter, to pulling to 53-46 on Matthews' 3-pointer with 2:13 left. Jordan followed with a layup to cut it to 53-48 before Tatum hit a 3-pointer for Boston with 39 seconds left, ending a 4:01 scoring drought. Boston hadn't scored since Smart's 3-pointer with 4:40 left put Boston up 53-36. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki received a standing ovation when he was introduced and entered the game with 1:07 left in the first quarter. Boston fans stood and cheered again in the final minute for Nowitzki, playing in his 21st season, who put his hands to his head after his final attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. Celtics: Tatum, a last-minute starter at forward with Marcus Morris out because of a stiff neck, scored 10 points in the first quarter. ... Daniel Theis had 13 rebounds. ... Rookie Brad Wanamaker scored a career-high eight points, three better than his previous high. ... Irving was on the bench, still recovering after scratching both corneas in a collision Monday at San Antonio. Irving also sat out Wednesday against Minnesota.","401071242"
"CLEVELAND --  After the Utah Jazz handed Cleveland its latest blowout loss, the Cavaliers decided it was a time for a talk. Coach Larry Drew referred to a lengthy postgame meeting with players as ""pretty somber"" following a 117-91 loss Friday night to the Jazz, who dominated the second half in sending Cleveland to its eighth straight loss. Donovan Mitchell scored 18 points, leading eight players in double figures. Utah trailed by one at halftime, but outscored the Cavaliers 69-42 in the second half and built a 34-point late in the game. ""That was pretty dramatic,"" Kyle Korver said of the second-half turnaround. ""We were a little more aggressive in the second half and we made some better plays."" Cleveland (8-31) has the worst record in the NBA, with four of the losses in the streak coming by 20 or more points. Drew said he let the players do most of the talking and was pleased with what he heard. Tristan Thompson, a key part of the team that has reached the last four NBA Finals, thinks the meeting was productive. ""After a tough loss sometimes it's good to get your emotions off your chest, and go home and look in the mirror and say, how can I be better for this team,"" he said. ""I've been around for a long time so I know how this stuff goes."" Thompson and Larry Nance Jr. said the meeting wasn't heated. Nance knows the Cavaliers need to play harder. ""Number one is effort,"" he said. ""Our first half was great. It's been great. But in the second half we come out and lay an egg. I think it's a lack of execution and heart."" While the Cavaliers are searching for answers, the mood in the Utah locker room was far more upbeat. ""You can play hard and not always play well,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""When you compete and stay with it, things tend to turn out well."" Jae Crowder, acquired from Cleveland last season, scored 16 points. Ricky Rubio, who was listed at questionable with a sore left foot, added 15 while Rudy Gobert had 12 points and seven rebounds. Alec Burks scored 17 points and rookie Collin Sexton had 13 for the Cavaliers. Cleveland led 64-61 midway through the third quarter, but Mitchell's 3-pointer tied the game and began a 20-7 run to end the period. Korver, acquired from Cleveland in November, was fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three shots. Crowder hit a 3-pointer and Utah led 81-71 going to the fourth quarter. Utah's blitz continued in the fourth on an assortment of 3-pointers and layups that sent fans heading to the exits early. The Cavaliers have struggled all season. Tyronn Lue was fired as coach after four games and Cleveland began the season 0-6. All-Star forward Kevin Love had left foot surgery on Nov. 2, playing in only four games. Love has been cleared to begin some basketball activities, but no timetable has been given for his return. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell didn't score until late in the second quarter on a drive to the basket. ... Utah, making the second stop on its four-game road trip, won't return home until Jan. 9 against Orlando. Cavaliers: Sexton, taken with the No. 8 pick in the draft, turned 20 years old Friday. ... G Patrick McCaw was given a turnover when his pass sailed close to teammate Jalen Jones, who was walking to the scorers table to check into the game. TRADE PARTNERS The teams made two deals in 2018. Korver, who played on two NBA Finals in Cleveland, was dealt to Utah for Burks. The deal followed a trade in February that saw Hood join the Cavaliers for Crowder. Korver, who played parts of three seasons with Cleveland, got a big ovation when his picture was shown on the scoreboard during a timeout. Hood had 12 points Friday night. ""It was like being back in practice with Rodney and A.B. out there,"" Mitchell said. ""That's kind of what it felt like."" ANOTHER INJURY Matthew Dellavedova missed the game with a sprained left foot. The backup guard, acquired from Milwaukee on Dec. 7, has provided a spark off the bench for the struggling team. Dellavedova is averaging 9.3 points and shooting 49 percent in 11 games.","401071243"
"MIAMI --  For the first time since October, the Miami Heat walked off the court with a winning record. Hassan Whiteside scored 21 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, Josh Richardson added 18 points and the Heat scrambled in the final minutes to hold off the Washington Wizards 115-109 on Friday night and move to 19-18, getting over the .500 mark for the first time since Oct. 27. ""It's definitely a good mental note,"" Richardson said. ""A reason to be positive and excited going forward. We just have to keep rolling now."" James Johnson scored 17 points and Dwyane Wade had 14 for Miami, which has won 12 of its last 17 games. Justise Winslow had 13 points and 10 assists for Miami, which lost its last four chances to get over .500. ""I saw some growth in our team tonight,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Bradley Beal led all scorers with 33 points for Washington, which had the NBA's longest current road losing streak extended to eight games. Beal also had nine rebounds and seven assists. Trevor Ariza scored 21, Otto Porter Jr. had 14 and Jeff Green and Thomas Bryant each added 10 for Washington. Washington cut the Miami lead to three on a driving layup by Beal with 1:27 remaining. Wade made one free throw on the next Miami possession, moments before Beal connected on a pullup 3 to get Washington within 110-109. Miami then had the game's final five points. ""If we have the same effort and intensity every night, we love our chances,"" Beal said. Miami led 95-86 going into the fourth, the seventh time in the last nine games between the clubs that someone held a single-digit lead going into the final 12 minutes. The Heat led by 11 early, but eventually the Wizards settled in and the first three quarters featured 10 ties and 10 lead changes. ""It seems like every time we play one another it comes down to a fourth-quarter game,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington missed tip-ins to close each of the first two quarters. ... Markieff Morris, who will miss the next 6-8 weeks with a neck issue, was on the court pregame getting in some very light non-contact work alongside Wizards assistant coach Kristi Toliver. ... John Wall, who has made Miami an offseason base in recent years, was on the Wizards' bench. He'll have season-ending surgery on his left heel in the coming days. Heat: Dion Waiters, who made his season debut Wednesday in Cleveland, did not play. Waiters got minutes Wednesday in part because Wade was unavailable because of a 24-hour virus. ... Miami finished with 62 points in the paint. ... The Heat lost games when they were 3-3, 5-5, 16-16 and 17-17. ALL-STAR WADE? Wade is second among Eastern Conference guards in fan balloting for next month's All-Star Game, which surprised him. ""I just appreciate and am humbled by people taking the time out to want to see my old self in the All-Star Game,"" Wade said. He's gotten massive amounts of fan support everywhere the Heat have played in this, his 16th and final season, and is already a 12-time All-Star. PORTER WORKING Porter played in his second game since coming back from a strained muscle in his leg, working his way up to 21 minutes. He was 7 for 14 from the field, but missed all five of his tries from 3-point range. ""Otto's feeling much better,"" Brooks said. ""We just want to keep his minutes at a manageable spot for the next game or two and go from there.""","401071244"
"CHICAGO --  Victor Oladipo calmly rose to the occasion again and helped the Indiana Pacers emerge from a frantic finish with another win. Oladipo banked in a 3-pointer from just above the top of the arc with 0.3 seconds left in overtime to give Indiana its sixth straight victory, 119-116 over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night. Oladipo had 36 points and seven rebounds, including some big baskets in the third quarter that gave the Pacers their first lead after Chicago got off to a fast start. On his game-winner, Indiana's leading scorer stepped from the center court logo toward the arc and fired a shot over Kris Dunn than kissed the backboard and dropped through the net. ""It felt great coming out of my hands, and it banked in,"" Oladipo said. ""It felt like I didn't bank it, it would have been a swish. I work on that shot all the time."" Chicago's Zach LaVine then hit a 3-pointer from the corner, but after time ran out in the extra period. Indiana's Domantas Sabonis added 23 points and 12 rebounds in the first game of a five-game trip. Thaddeus Young had 16 points, including several key baskets down the stretch in the fourth quarter, to help the Pacers overcome an early 12-point deficit. ""(Oladipo) is our star,"" Young said. ""Before overtime started, I pulled him aside and said, `It's time to take us to the promised land."" The Bulls (10-29) young lineup gave the rising Pacers (26-12) all they could handle. LaVine led Chicago with 31 points. He made two 3-pointers in the closing moments of regulation to tie it at 105 and send it to overtime. He hit the first 3 with 17.3 seconds left from outside the left side of the arc, then knotted it with 3.9 seconds remaining from almost the same spot. Indiana made nine of 28 3-point attempts, but Chicago hit 12 of 28. ""We need to get closer and pressure the ball,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said.  ""The good thing is you can learn off a win."" Lauri Markkanen had 27 points, and Dunn had 16 points and 17 assists for Chicago. LaVine was 5 for 9 from beyond the arc. Markkanen was 4 of 9. ""I think we got in a rhythm early where we were pushing the pace and were taking and making 3's,"" LaVine said. ""It's just one of those types of games you want to win.  Either team could have said we should have won that game."" The Bulls dropped their third straight and fourth in their last five. But Chicago looked quick and confident, and nothing like a team that had been clobbered 112-84 by Orlando on Wednesday. ""I think everyone had their moments when they were feeling hot and were making shots,"" Markkanen said. ""I think we found the right guys at the right times tonight and just tried to play unselfish and make plays."" Chicago led 78-75 heading into the fourth quarter, but Indiana grabbed a six-point lead with 1:12 left when Sabonis hit a pair of free throws. LaVine then tied it TRADE FALLOUT: Guards MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden Jr., acquired by the Bulls in a trade Thursday that sent guard Justin Holiday to Memphis, has not yet joined Chicago. The Grizzlies also sent second-round picks in 2019 and 2020 to the rebuilding Bulls. Chicago waived guard Cameron Payne in another move. ""What we did last night was consistent with our direction,"" Executive Vice President-Basketball Operations John Paxson said. ""Getting the two second-round picks was important to us. We're going to keep Wayne Selden. He's a young player and we'll see what he develops into. It's a deal we felt we had to make."" YOUTH TO THE FRONT: Chandler Hutchison, a 22-year-old rookie forward, moved into Chicago's young lineup and made his fourth start this season. Hutchison and the Bulls' four other starters -- Markkanen, Wendel Carter Jr., LaVine and Dunn -- were all first-round picks. Dunn, who's 24, is the oldest in the group. Carter is the youngest at 19. ""(The trade) gives Chandler Hutchison an opportunity to play,"" Paxson said. ""He'll have to meet the standards Jim (Boylen) and we want, but he'll get the opportunity."" TIP-INS Pacers: C Myles Turner was back in the starting lineup, wearing a face mask, after breaking his nose in a collision with Atlanta forward-center John Collins midway through the third quarter of a 116-108 win Monday in Indianapolis. Turner had 20 points, eight rebounds and blocked four shots in less than 24 minutes in that game, then needed only a brief medical procedure to fix his nose. ""I'm feeling great,"" Turner said before Friday's game. ""Excited to get out there."" Bulls: F Bobby Portis (sprained right ankle) missed his seventh straight game but might return Sunday when the Bulls host Brooklyn. Portis will have another contact day on Saturday. ""It does look good,"" coach Jim Boylen said, ""but I'm not going to bank on it."" ... F Jabari Parker entered the game in the first quarter after not playing since Dec. 13 at Orlando (nine games) due to illness and coaching decisions.","401071245"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Brooklyn Nets had the right formula for a winning start to their road trip. ""Defense, defense, defense. I thought we were outstanding defensively,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. D'Angelo Russell had 23 points and 10 assists, DeMarre Carroll added 20 points, including five 3-pointers, and the Nets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 109-100 on Friday night. The Nets limited Memphis to 45 percent shooting, including 5 of 24 (21 percent) from outside the arc, and won for the 11th time in their last 14 games. That came after the Nets lost eight in a row, quite a reversal that has moved Brooklyn into the Eastern Conference's eighth playoff spot. ""One game at a time,"" Russell said. As for the change of play during the recent span, Russell said: ""It's the focus, defense. I would say everybody coming into their place. Everybody's realizing their roles, and it's leading to wins."" Joe Harris added 18 points for the Nets, who had six players in double figures. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 13 points and Jarrett Allen had 12 points and 12 rebounds, including five off the offensive glass. Mike Conley, held scoreless in Wednesday's loss to Detroit, led the Grizzlies with 31 points. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 19 and Kyle Anderson managed a triple-double with 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Marc Gasol had 13 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. While the Nets relished in their reversal of fortunes, the Memphis malaise continued. The Grizzlies have lost four in a row, 11 of their last 14 and the frustration led to a locker room fracas after Wednesday's loss to the Detroit Pistons. While tempers cooled, the tussle didn't seem to lead to better energy or results for the Grizzlies. ""We have to stick together obviously, but there's no more talking to do,"" Anderson said. ""You have to go out there and perform."" The Nets led 48-47 at intermission, but pulled away in the fourth with a 9-2 run in the latter half of the quarter. That gave Brooklyn a 106-94 cushion and Memphis never got closer than six points the rest of the way. ""I do think there's a little bit of self-doubt,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of his team's mindset. ""When times get tough, and you're going through these situations, that can start to creep in. ""But we've got to find a way to get it done. No one is come to save us."" TIP-INS Nets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson missed his second straight game with a right adductor strain. ... Carroll's previous season high for 3-pointers was four on two other occasions. . ... The victory gave the Nets three straight road wins over the Grizzlies, matching the longest against the Grizzlies since the team was in Vancouver in late 1990s. ...

Grizzlies: Conley was listed as questionable with left shoulder soreness from an injury suffered in Wednesday night's loss to the Pistons. ... Justin Holiday, acquired in a trade with the Chicago Bulls, was not with the team yet. ... Anderson recorded his first career triple-double and 13th in franchise history. ... Memphis had five blocks and nine steals, four of the steals by Conley. REVENGE The Brooklyn victory avenged a 131-125 double-overtime loss to Memphis on Nov. 30. This time, the Nets outscored the Grizzlies in the fourth to make sure and avoid overtime. ""We owed them one,"" Russell said. ""I felt like we gave it away to them last time, so we had to learn from it and not do that this time."" OUTSIDE THE ARC ADVANTAGE The Nets finished 13 of 34 from 3-point range, the 10th game in the last 11 that a Memphis opponent has made double-digit 3-pointers. Over the last 10 games, opponents are averaging 13.5 made 3-pointers. ""We're giving up too many 3s,"" Grizzlies guard Garrett Temple said, adding that the weakside help seems confused right now. "".I don't know because the game plan is clear. But we have to find way to run guys off (the 3-point line).""","401071246"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Through 17 minutes, the Minnesota Timberwolves watched the Orlando Magic shoot 76.4 percent and open a 19-point lead. Returning home after a trip was looking like another letdown for Minnesota. Then the Timberwolves started playing team defense. Karl-Anthony Towns had 29 points and 15 rebounds, and Jeff Teague added 23 points and 10 assists in his return to the Minnesota lineup in the Timberwolves' 120-103 comeback victory Friday night. Taj Gibson added 14 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota. The Timberwolves recovered from a 19-point deficit midway through the second quarter with a 44-12 run through the 5:51 of the third quarter. ""Once we started playing defense,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I thought the last five minutes of the second quarter we got going. We got some stops. I thought (Anthony Tolliver) gave us a big lift. He hit a couple big 3s and that gave us the energy, gave us a lift, and the defense, I thought, in the second half was very good."" Nikola Vucevic had 22 points for Orlando, but just eight after the first quarter. The Magic, who had won three of four, hit 26 of their first 34 shots (76.4 percent) before fading. Terrence Ross scored 13 points off the bench for Orlando, but he missed his final four 3-pointers after starting 3 of 5 from beyond the arc during the Magic's hot start. Evan Fournier added 21 points. ""This game was ours to take, to be honest,"" Fournier said. ""It was really ours. When you're up 20 on the road, you should be winning those games."" Minnesota found a way to slow Orlando in the second and continued the momentum into the second half. The Magic missed 12 of their final 14 shots of the first half and were 7 of 23 in the third quarter. Teague and Towns took over offensively in the second half. Teague had nine points and four assists in the third, and Towns had 21 points in the second half after first-half foul trouble. ""It was just lazy, undisciplined and soft,"" Orlando forward Aaron Gordon said. ""We didn't have it tonight on the defensive end. It's not OK at this point in the season."" The Wolves came back from a halftime deficit for the sixth time in 22 games this season. Friday matched their best comeback of the season and five of their six wins when trailing at the half have come at home.

TIP-INS Magic: F Jonathon Simmons returned after missing two games because of a sprained left ankle. Simmons scored six points in 21 minutes off the bench. ... Orlando set a season high with the 68 first-half points. The franchise record is 78, set on Nov. 3, 2010, against Minnesota.

Teague was 8 of 10 from the field and hit all three of his 3-pointers, including a quick shot from 28 feet to beat the 24-second clock on one third-quarter possession. It was Teague's fourth game of the season with at least 20 points. ""Teague lived in the paint,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said.

"MILWAUKEE --  The last thing the Milwaukee Bucks wanted on Friday was a grind-it-out game, with Eastern Conference rival Toronto coming to town the next night to complete a back-to-back set. No need to worry in Mike Budenholzer's first game against his former team. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 16 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists in just 19 minutes, and the Bucks starters got plenty of rest in a 144-112 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Khris Middleton scored 19 points while hitting all four of his 3-point attempts. Malcolm Brogdon also scored 19 and point guard Eric Bledsoe added 14 points and eight assists for the Bucks, who led 43-14 after 12 minutes. ""Obviously, the first quarter (we) threw a big punch on both ends of the court,"" Budenholzer said. ""I thought the effort by Eric Bledsoe was great. To have that kind of lead and set the tone, the starters were phenomenal."" Antetokounmpo and the rest of the Milwaukee starters did not play in the fourth quarter. ""It was huge,"" Middleton said. ""We get off to a great start, set the tone early and keep it going the whole game. Hopefully it can prepare us for tomorrow."" Milwaukee (27-10) improved its NBA-best record as it won its fifth straight and for the ninth time in 10 games. The Bucks tied a season high for points in a game, equaling their total against Sacramento on Nov. 4, and scored more than 140 for a league-best third time. ""They're the No. 1 team in the league right now,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""They're playing with an edge and we saw that tonight. ""We just didn't have it. That's part of our growing pains and part of our growth, to understand that you have to go through these things."" Toronto (28-12) is coming off a road loss to San Antonio and already has lost the first two games against Milwaukee this season. The Bucks could capture the season tiebreaker with another win Saturday. ""It's neck-and-neck right now,"" Middleton said. ""But we try to keep the focus on us. It's a long season. We're not complacent with where we're at right now. We still can be better in some areas so we're going to stay hungry."" Budenholzer led the Hawks to the playoffs in four of his five seasons with the team and his 2014-15 squad won 60 games and reached the Eastern Conference finals. The rebuilding Hawks (11-27) were no match for the Bucks, who led by as many as 38 points in the first half. Milwaukee took a 76-43 halftime lead, tying the second-largest halftime lead in franchise history and the largest since 1978. Milwaukee extended the lead to as many as 46 points in the fourth quarter. DeAndre Bembry led Atlanta with 19 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 14 while hitting 4 of 9 3-pointers. The Bucks had 12 players score eight or more points -- the most by any team in a game since the 1976-77 season. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta has two rookies making major contributions: fifth overall pick Trae Young, acquired in a draft-night deal with Dallas; and 19th overall pick Kevin Huerter. Young, the former Oklahoma star and 6-foot-2 guard, entered Friday averaging 15.4 points and 7.4 assists. He had only two points in the first three quarters but finished with 13 points in 31 minutes. Huerter, who played at Maryland, scored a personal-best 22 points at Indiana on Dec. 31 and had 12 points in 44 minutes against Washington on Wednesday. ""We played him 40 minutes in Indiana and he gets a career high,"" Pierce said. ""It was kind of a lesson to me. Play him more. Get him more shots and his shot attempts have gone up in every month, so we're finding more productivity with more opportunity. So, it's my job to get him more opportunity.""<U+FFFD>Huerter scored 10 points Friday. ... Former Bucks forward Miles Plumlee (left knee pain) was unavailable for the Hawks after being ruled out following the team's morning shootaround. Bucks: Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova returned to the lineup for the first time since breaking his nose in practice on Dec. 16. Second-year forward D.J. Wilson has played well in Ilyasova's absence, and Budenholzer said he wasn't sure how he would distribute playing time. ""It's the hard part about our league,"" Budenholzer said. ""When you have a roster with a lot of depth and a lot of good players, sometimes you have to make hard decisions. Sometimes you play a little bigger rotation. But we've certainly been happy with D.J., happy with Thon (Maker). Ersan is a veteran guy and we're happy to have him back. This league is amazing how opportunity is always right around the corner if someone isn't playing."" Ilyasova drew a charge -- his specialty -- just 13 seconds after entering the game in the first quarter. He finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds in 19 minutes.","401071248"
"PHOENIX --  Marcin Gortat figures he is the beneficiary of coach Doc Rivers' New Year's resolution. Gortat had not played in the fourth quarter in the first 36 games of the season until the calendar turned, and he responded with his first double-double of the season when the Clippers extended their dominance of the Phoenix Suns with a 121-111 victory Friday night. ""You never know with Doc,"" Gortat said after getting 18 points and 13 rebounds in 25 minutes. ""You just have to be ready. You earn your minutes. Obviously if you play well, you might earn a few more minutes. That's all I'm trying to do, help the team to win."" Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams scored 21 points apiece and four other Clippers finished in double figures as they won their third straight against the Suns this season and their 11th straight in the series. Patrick Beverley scored 16 points for the Clippers, who led by 29 points in the second quarter. Beverley made four 3-pointers, Williams had three and Tobias Harris added two with his 16 points. Montrezl Harrell scored 15. ""I loved how we started the game,"" Rivers said. ""The way we can score, if we defend, it's hard for anyone to beat us."" Devin Booker scored 23 points and T.J. Warren had 20 for the Suns, who lost their fifth straight. The Suns, down by 30 with 4 1/2 minutes remaining in the third quarter, used 22-5 run fueled by seven points from Jamal Crawford and six by Josh Jackson to close to 91-78 entering the fourth quarter. Mikal Bridges' slam on the first possession of the period brought the Suns within 11, but Williams made two 3-pointers and a three-point play as the Clippers again pulled away. ""We understand (Phoenix) is a young team,"" Williams said. ""They are putting pieces together, trying to figure out their identity. So we just come in and play hard."" The Clippers shot 51 percent from the field and held a 43-25 rebounding edge. Los Angeles outrebounded the Suns by 42 in the three meetings this season. ""We don't have stupid great rebounders on this team,"" Gortat said. ""Everybody has to rebound. We have to box out, hit somebody. ""Make sure we are the guys who are hitting first. Then go get the ball. We have to make them miss and get the ball. Not every game is going to look that way, but today it worked perfectly. Reserves Richaun Holmes and Crawford had 16 points apiece for the Suns. Suns center Deandre Ayton had four points, tying a season low set in the first game against the Clippers on Nov. 28. He had three field goal attempts, five rebounds, three assists and four turnovers. ""You know (coach) Larry Brown used to say, `You need the touches, you go get it,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""(Three) touches? It's on all of us."" The Suns fell behind early, a problem in their last several starts. Harris and Williams made two 3-pointers apiece in the first quarter, when the Clippers shot 71.4 percent and finished on a 23-6 run for a 38-19 edge. The Clippers led 63-34 on Gallinari's first 3-pointer with 4 minutes left in the half. It was 68-44 at halftime. Phoenix trailed Philadelphia by 22 points after 16 minutes of its 132-127 loss on Wednesday and was down by 17 at halftime of a 132-109 loss to Golden State on New Year's Eve. TIP-INS Clippers: The Clippers play six of their next seven games at home, only away for an over-night trip to Denver on Jan. 10. ... Boban Marjanovic, one of three Clippers to have a double-double against the Suns on Nov. 28, did not play. Suns: Ayton had double-doubles in nine of his previous 11 games, and he had nine rebounds in the other game in that stretch. ... The Suns are 5-16 at home. Only New York (4-12) has fewer home victories. ... Booker has seven 35-point games, tied for third in the league behind James Harden (15) and Stephen Curry (eight). BIG BENCH The Clippers' reserves had 61 points. They entered the game averaging a league-high 52.4 Williams and Harrell have not started a game this season, and Beverley flip-flopped with Avery Bradley on Nov. 20. All average at least 25 minutes a game, and Williams (18.2) and Harrell (15.7) are the Clippers' third- and fourth-leading scorers. ""`Trez' could start, we know that. Lou could start,"" Rivers said. ""The fact that they are OK coming off the bench is the first key. I do think it takes a special mindset for a guy to want to do that and then guys who accept to do that. We have that.""","401071249"
"LOS ANGELES --  Knicks owner James Dolan stopped by the New York locker room to offer his congratulations and to bring the team together in a huddle. The players and coaches whooped and clapped in celebration of a skid-snapping victory. The Knicks hope this resilient performance against the Lakers is a turning point in their trying season. The Lakers just hope LeBron James feels better very soon. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 22 points, Trey Burke added 16 and the Knicks snapped their eight-game losing streak with a 119-112 victory over Los Angeles on Friday night. Emmanuel Mudiay had 15 points and seven rebounds for the Knicks, who blew an early 17-point lead before rallying from a six-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Enes Kanter scored eight of his 16 points down the stretch as the Knicks pulled away, ending their first win since Dec. 14 on an 11-3 run. ""I think this is a confidence-booster,"" said Burke, who excelled in his most extensive playing time in 2  1/2 weeks. ""We've been in a lot of games, but it doesn't matter when you don't pull it out. ... That was putting together a complete second half. They went on a run, and we responded to it."" The Lakers dropped to 1-4 without James, who is sidelined for at least another week with a left groin strain. Los Angeles also played without second-leading scorer Kyle Kuzma, who has a bruised back. New York capitalized on the Lakers' injuries to earn just its second win in 15 games. ""Obviously it's a different team without LeBron,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. The Knicks took the lead for good on Kevin Knox's free throws with 3:45 left, and Kanter came up with two big baskets in the final minute. Seven players scored in double figures for New York, including 10 points in the fourth quarter from Mario Hezonja, who also had barely played since mid-December. ""We shared the ball and trusted each other down the stretch,"" said Fizdale, a Los Angeles native with plenty of friends and family in the stands. ""The best part is we closed the game defensively. ... When we win, we celebrate like it's a Super Bowl. Why not?"" Brandon Ingram scored 21 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 19 for the Lakers, who forced only two turnovers in the second half and struggled for consistent offense. ""We've got to learn how to handle adversity and learn how to execute down the stretch in the fourth quarter,"" said Josh Hart, who scored six points on 2-for-11 shooting. ""We're losing the same way, and that's the frustrating part about it."" TIP-INS Knicks: Frank Ntilikina played only briefly in the first half before straining his left ankle and sitting out the rest of the game. He wore a walking boot after the game. ... Rookie Mitchell Robinson missed his ninth straight game with a sprained left ankle. Fizdale says they're being cautious with his recovery. ... Burke had his highest-scoring performance since before Thanksgiving. ... Dolan watched the game from a baseline seat near the Lakers' bench at Staples Center. Lakers: Kuzma was hurt in LA's loss to Oklahoma City on Wednesday. Kuzma stayed home from Staples Center for this game, but coach Luke Walton is hopeful the forward will feel good enough to participate on their upcoming two-game road trip. ... JaVale McGee had 18 points and nine rebounds, but just one basket in the fourth quarter. SLOW START FOR LA The Knicks rolled early, scoring 39 points in the first quarter and jumping to a healthy lead early in the second with Hardaway's offense and strong defense. The Lakers frequently look lost on offense without James, as might be expected, but Caldwell-Pope and Lonzo Ball hit three 3-pointers apiece in the first half to keep it close. BEAS IS BACK Michael Beasley returned from a 13-game absence and scored six points in his first appearance since Dec. 7. The former Knicks forward has been away frequently during his first season with the Lakers to be with his mother, who died of cancer last month. Beasley went in to the Knicks' locker room after the game to catch up with old friends.","401071250"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Oklahoma City Thunder had a six-game overall losing streak to the Trail Blazers, and they had lost their last eight at the Moda Center, a streak dating back to 2014. Proclaiming a ""new year, new team,"" Paul George scored 37 points and the Thunder beat the Blazers 111-109 victory on Friday night. ""We came here, we told ourselves we need to change it -- and we got it done,"" George said. Russell Westbrook added 31 points for the Thunder, who held off a furious last-minute rally by the Blazers that fell short. Damian Lillard led Portland with 23 points and eight assists. ""I was thinking about it when I landed yesterday,"" Westbrook said about the long drought. ""For me, this was personal. I wanted the streak to end."" The Thunder trailed by as many as 11 points in the first half but pulled in front late in the third quarter and pushed the lead to 107-97 with just over 4 minutes to go on a basket by Westbrook, who scored 20 points came in the second half. CJ McCollum's jumper got Portland within 109-105 and Lillard made two of three free throws to cut the deficit with 42.8 seconds left. Lillard and McCollum both missed shots before George made free throws with 4.3 seconds left. The Blazers fell short on Al-Farouq Aminu's basket at the buzzer. ""The Blazers are a tough team to play against and this is a tough place to play. To find a way to get a win here, since it's been a while, sometimes you've got to do a lot of different things,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Oklahoma City, sitting in second place in the Western Conference behind the Nuggets, has won three straight, including a 107-100 victory over the Lakers on Wednesday. The Thunder rose to 12 games over .500 for the first time this season. The Blazers had won two straight overall and were coming off a 113-108 overtime victory in Sacramento on New Year's Day. The game against the Thunder was the first of a five-game homestand. ""You put yourself in that type of position, it comes down to -- like I always say -- you've got to be perfect. We needed to probably make every shot, get every stop,"" Lillard said. ""We just came up short. We had plenty of opportunity."" George got off to a fast start with 13 points in the opening quarter, including a pair of free throws that pulled the Thunder into a 28-all tie. The Blazers went up 47-39 after Jake Layman's 3-pointer, and extended the lead to 58-47 after Maurice Harkless' 3. Jusuf Nurkic had 16 first-half points and Portland went into the break with a 62-57 lead. The Thunder closed within 80-78 on Steven Adams' layup then took an 83-82 lead on George's 3-pointer. Aminu answered with a 3 for the Blazers but George made another 3 and the Thunder went into the final period with a 93-87 lead. ""We really increased the defensive pressure in the second half and made it harder for them to score,"" George said. Nurkic finished with 22 points and eight rebounds. ""It was disappointing, kind of a crazy game,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""I thought we had good flow and good momentum most of the game."" TIP-INS Thunder: George had 21 points at the half. ... Terrance Ferguson fouled out with 2:43 left. ... It was the first of four meetings between the teams. Last season Portland won all four of its games against the Thunder. Trail Blazers: Nurkic was coming off a rare 5-by-5 (five points, five rebounds, five assists, five steals, and five blocks) against the Kings on Tuesday, when he had 24 points, 23 rebounds, seven assists, five steals and five blocks. The only other Blazer with one was Nic Batum. Nurkic is the first NBA player to pull off a 5-by-5 with 20-plus points and rebounds. REMEMBERING LARRY: The Blazers held a moment of silence for Larry Weinberg, one of the founders and original owners of the team, who died on Monday. Weinberg was among those who got the franchise started as an NBA expansion team in 1970. He sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1988.","401071251"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic's impressive numbers took a backseat to his coast-to-coast dunk. Cheered by the sellout crowd for his jam, he was also teased by his teammates. To him, the slam was a thing of beauty. ""Poetry in motion,"" the 7-footer said. Jokic scored a season-high 39 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, reserve Paul Millsap added 18 points and the Western Conference-leading Nuggets knocked off the Charlotte Hornets 123-110 on Saturday for their 10th straight home victory. That's two straight games where Jokic's now had a memorable dunk . ""If I'm not tired and 100 percent sure I'm going to dunk it, I'm going to dunk,"" Jokic explained. ""But two points is two points -- however you score."" His slam in the third quarter led to some good-natured ribbing from teammates such as Torrey Craig, who also had a high-flying dunk. ""He's feeling pretty bouncy lately,"" Craig playfully said. Jokic took it all in stride. ""Just because (Craig) can jump high, doesn't mean he can dunk better,"" Jokic said. Jokic turned in another impressive stat line, also adding six assists, three steals and one blocked shot. He was 16 of 29 from the floor and 4 of 5 from the line. ""You try to play him straight up, he's going to do what he wants,"" Hornets guard Malik Monk said. ""We just tried to play him straight up and he just exploited us on that. He's a great player. I can't say anything bad about him."" At 26-11, the Nuggets are off to their best NBA start in franchise history. This also marks the latest they've been in first place in the conference since March 16, 1977. To think, they're not even at full strength yet. But they're getting closer. Millsap and Gary Harris, who had 17 points off the bench, are steadily getting back up to speed after returning from injuries. The team is still missing starter Will Barton. ""It's good to be healthy. It's good to be whole,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Both (Millsap and Harris) showed they're ready to take their starting jobs back. Me bringing them off the bench was trying to get them back into a game rhythm."" Kemba Walker had 20 points for the Hornets, who kicked off a six-game trip. Bismack Biyombo added a season-high 16 points. Trey Lyles and Millsap hit back-to-back 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter to give the Nuggets a 105-93 lead. Craig cemented the win with a dunk on a fast break with 1:50 remaining to extend the lead to 14. Denver scored 27 points off turnovers. ""When you play hard, good things happen,"" Harris said. ""We have to continue to do that."" TIP-INS Hornets: Biyombo was in the starting lineup with C Cody Zeller out after he had surgery to fix a broken right hand. ... G Jeremy Lamb missed a second straight game with a strained right hamstring. ""He's progressing well,"" coach James Borrego reported. ... F Marvin Williams was called for a flagrant foul when he tried to prevent a layup by Craig in the second quarter. Nuggets: Denver led Charlotte in points in the paint by a 64-48 margin. ... Had a season-high 31 second-chance points. ... Jokic's 29 shot attempts were a season high. OH, BROTHER It was a Hernangomez family reunion as Nuggets forward Juancho Hernangomez faced older brother Willy, who's a center for the Hornets. Juancho didn't score in nearly 20 minutes of work, while Willy had 10 points in 15:35. Willy Hernangomez didn't play in their first meeting Dec. 7, when Juancho had 15 points in Denver's 113-107 loss. FRONT-ROW SEAT Craig had the hustle play of the day late in the fourth, saving a ball heading out of bounds and winding up about five rows deep into the stands. ""I had beer all over my shorts and legs,"" said Craig, who finished with 12 points. ENERGY Monk scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half, including a 3-point buzzer-beater over Jamal Murray to end the third that cut it to 89-84.

"DETROIT --  Donovan Mitchell was having a quiet game offensively when he was pulled less than three minutes into the third quarter. ""I wasn't doing enough on either end,"" the Utah star said. That changed in a hurry. Mitchell would eventually return and score 24 of his 26 points in the second half, and the Jazz outlasted the Detroit Pistons 110-105 on Saturday night. Utah rallied from an 18-point, second-quarter deficit. The Jazz nearly squandered an 11-point lead of their own in the final quarter, allowing the Pistons to cut the lead to one on a 3-pointer by Blake Griffin. Ricky Rubio made two free throws for Utah with 12.3 seconds remaining, and then Detroit's Reggie Jackson turned the ball over on a crosscourt pass. Griffin scored 34 points for the Pistons. Detroit led 38-20 before the Jazz ran off 14 straight points to get back in the game. ""I thought we started the game with the heart and fight you need to win in this league, but that didn't continue with the second unit in the second quarter,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""They usually really bring energy, and it wasn't there tonight. That continued into the second half."" The Pistons built the lead back to 11 in the third, but Utah finally took the lead for the first time when Rudy Gobert's dunk made it 85-84 in the fourth. The Jazz went on a 19-4 run and led 99-88 after Joe Ingles made a 3-pointer from the corner and then waved goodbye in the direction of his teammates on the bench. The Pistons didn't go away, though. A 3-pointer by Jackson cut the margin to four. Mitchell answered that with a 3-pointer of his own to make it 102-95. Detroit kept chipping away and the lead was down to two after Griffin scored inside. But Mitchell again came through, connecting on a midrange shot with 22 seconds left for a 106-102 lead. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah trailed 31-13 after shooting 4 for 21 from the field in the first quarter. Pistons: Detroit has lost six of eight. ... Andre Drummond had 15 points and 18 rebounds in his 500th career game. ... Reggie Bullock scored 14 of his 19 points in the first quarter. MOTIVATION Mitchell scored 12 points in the third quarter and 12 in the fourth. A fan in Detroit was apparently doing quite a bit of chirping at him, and Mitchell cited that as a reason for his big second half. ""It really just snapped for me,"" Mitchell said. ""I don't remember what he said, but after that, I just started being aggressive. It shouldn't take for somebody to say something for me to play how I play, but that's what happened."" CARELESS The Pistons had only four turnovers in the first half but had 14 in the second. ""Great teams go from an 18-point lead to a 28-point lead and they keep it there,"" Griffin said. ""We just haven't got to that level yet where we put our foot on people's throats and don't let up. So, that's the next step for us."" LIMITED Gobert played only 7:02 during a first half in which he picked up three fouls. He finished with nine points and 11 rebounds. ""We didn't make it easy on ourselves, the way we started the game,"" coach Quin Snyder said.","401071253"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons carried the load without Jimmy Butler. And when Butler returns, the 76ers stars expect Philadelphia to keep rolling. Embiid had 25 points and 12 rebounds, and Simmons added 20 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in Philadelphia's 106-100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night. Embiid hit two key free throws late for Philadelphia, which was without Butler for the second straight game due to an upper respiratory infection. The four-time All-Star wasn't around to address a published report that said he recently challenged coach Brett Brown in a disrespectful way about his role in the offense. Brown downplayed the incident before the game, and both Embiid and Simmons expressed the belief afterward that the three stars can coexist. ""Everybody is trying to fit in,"" Embiid said. ""We are going to keep working on it. We are inching toward it, and we are going to get there."" Simmons added: ""Jimmy's been great, amazing for me."" JJ Redick added 20 points for Philadelphia, which improved to 17-3 at home while winning its fourth in the last five. Wesley Matthews had 18 points to pace short-handed Dallas, which fell to 3-18 on the road. The Mavericks were without Dirk Nowitzki (rest), Devin Harris (back) and J.J. Barea (ankle). Rookie guard Jalen Brunson came off the bench to contribute 13 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. The 76ers, who led by as many as 19 points in the second half, were seemingly in total control until Luka Doncic's 3-pointer with just over a minute remaining cut the lead to 101-97. The lead still was four when Dwight Powell made one of two free throws for the Mavericks with 50 seconds left. ""We gave ourselves a chance to win it,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. But Embiid, with ""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" chants raining down from the sold-out crowd, drained two foul shots with 28 seconds remaining to give Philadelphia breathing room. ""Once again, we had to make the game interesting,"" Embiid said. The 76ers had a 30-point advantage dwindle to three points before pulling out a 132-127 victory at Phoenix on Wednesday in their previous game. Philadelphia methodically pulled away, increasing a 31-26 first-quarter advantage to 59-51 at the half. The 76ers made 10 of 20 field goals in the third quarter, settling for an 87-70 lead to start the fourth. Nowitzki didn't play on the second night of a back-to-back after going scoreless in the Mavericks' 114-93 loss at Boston on Friday night. Nowitzki missed all 10 of his shots, including eight from 3-point range, while failing to score for just the ninth time in his 21-year career. He needed two points to become the Western Conference player with the most points on Boston's home court. TIP-INS Mavericks: DeAndre Jordan bruised his left hand in the first half but returned. . Doncic had 14 points but shot 4 for 16 from the field, including 1 for 8 from 3-point range. 76ers: Philadelphia is 17-8 since acquiring Butler from the Minnesota Timberwolves in November. ... Simmons reached a triple-double for the sixth time. BUTLER BABBLE Brown dismissed the Butler report before Saturday's game. ""I didn't feel like any of that crossed the line,"" Brown said. ""He's vocal. He's all in and he has opinions, but it's instigated by me. None of this should surprise anybody. He's got opinions. He wants to be heard. And he should be heard."" Philadelphia acquired Butler last month with an eye on making a run to the NBA championship. But meshing Butler with stars Simmons and Embiid hasn't always been easy, which Brown acknowledged. ""There's nobody trying to figure this out more than I am,"" Brown said. BRUNSON'S RETURN Brunson, who played collegiately at nearby Villanova, was honored before the game by the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association as its Amateur Athlete of the Year after helping the Wildcats to their second national title in three years last April. Brunson's dad, Rick, a well-traveled NBA guard who played collegiately at Temple, sat courtside to watch his son's best game of his young career. ""He was terrific all around,"" Carlisle said. ""He looked right at home. I was happy for him. I thought he did a lot of good things.""","401071254"
"CLEVELAND --  Cavaliers coach Larry Drew hoped a team meeting following a blowout loss a night earlier would move his struggling team in a positive direction. Instead, Cleveland's ninth straight loss was its most lopsided of the season. Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle both scored 22 points, and the New Orleans Pelicans routed the Cavaliers 133-98 on Saturday. The defeat came a night after Drew and his players had a long talk following a 26-point loss to Utah. Cleveland (8-32) not only has the worst record in the league, but hasn't played competitive basketball during most of the losing streak. ""We knew they played last night, so for us, we wanted to get out and run more to get them tired,"" said Pelicans star Anthony Davis, who didn't play in the fourth quarter. ""We know they've been struggling in third quarters, so we went out hard."" The Cavaliers have lost six straight at home by a total of 141 points. The last five defeats have been by 20 or more points, an NBA record. Drew benched four starters when New Orleans began the third quarter with a 15-0 run, which likely will lead to lineup changes when Cleveland hosts Indiana on Tuesday. ""We can't continue to go at this rate,"" Drew said. ""I refuse to. It's important these guys understand that, one, this is not acceptable and, two, I'm not going to let this continue at this pace. I've got to do something different."" Center Tristan Thompson has gone from playing on a team that reached four straight NBA Finals to one that seems to get blown out every night. ""It definitely tests your character,"" he said. ""If you love the game and you care about being a competitor, you're going to hate times like this. You're going to have sleepless nights and it's gong to mess with you."" Davis had 20 points and 10 rebounds. Randle had 12 rebounds and six Pelicans scored in double figures. ""Our offense was really good and our defense was really good,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""When you're running on misses, not makes, it makes a big difference for your offense."" Jordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 23 points. Rookie Collin Sexton and Jalen Jones both had 15. New Orleans' third-quarter run pushed the lead to 76-52, and Larry Nance Jr. was the only Cleveland starter who remained on the floor. The margin grew throughout the second half and reached 39 points at 132-93 in the last two minutes. Davis set a franchise record with 26 rebounds and scored a game-high 34 points in Wednesday's loss to Brooklyn. Nance and Thompson each picked up two fouls in the first eight minutes trying to defend the All-Star forward. Channing Frye, who had played in only 18 games, came off the bench and also fouled Davis. New Orleans broke away from a 28-all tie with Davis getting a rest. Holiday had nine points in the quarter and Randle added seven, helping the Pelicans build a 61-52 halftime lead. Cleveland's injury problems have been a major factor in its season-long struggles. All-Star forward Kevin Love has started some basketball activities after surgery on his left foot in November, but there's no timetable for his return. Rodney Hood (sore left Achilles) and Matthew Dellavedova (sprained left foot) were out Saturday. Hood played the last two games after missing three in a row. Dellavedova didn't play Friday. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans broke a six-game road losing streak and is 5-16 away from home. ... C Nikola Mirotic (right ankle) sat out his 11th straight game. Cavaliers: Sexton appeared to injure his left arm after being knocked to the floor in a collision with Holiday in the second quarter, but stayed in the game. ... C Ante Zizic (sore right knee) and G David Nwaba (sprained left ankle) are also out with injuries. TAKE A SEAT Sexton, Thompson, Cedi Osman and Alec Burks were all benched during New Orleans' big run to start the third. The four returned later in the quarter. ""If you lose by 40 two games in a row, you might as well make a change and switch things,"" Thompson said. ""It's worth a shot."" BIG NIGHT Randle barely fell short of a triple-double with eight assists. The Pelicans shot 58 percent while holding Cleveland to 36-of-88 shooting. ""This was really good for us, a win like this,"" Randle said. ""I like what we were doing on the defensive end.""","401071255"
"MILWAUKEE --  Kawhi Leonard had a simple explanation after the Toronto Raptors' latest victory. ""If you want to win, you got to play defense,"" Leonard said. ""That is every game in the NBA."" Leonard and Pascal Siakam each scored 30 points, with Siakam setting a career high, and the Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks 123-116 on Saturday night in a matchup of the top two teams in the NBA standings. Leonard also matched his season high with five steals. Serge Ibaka added 25 points and nine rebounds, Fred VanVleet had a season-high tying 21 points and Danny Green 12 points and nine rebounds for Toronto which snapped a three-game losing streak to Milwaukee. Toronto improved to 29-12, and Milwaukee dropped to 27-11. Milwaukee led in the first quarter, but saw the margin shrink to one at the half as Toronto started making shots and playing defense. ""I thought that we kind of took some air out of them a little bit there,"" VanVleet said. ""That was a huge way to close the half. We closed it (the second) with a 7-0 run and came out in the third quarter with another run. I thought that we were in control for the rest of the way."" The Bucks clung to a 57-56 lead at the half, but the Raptors had already turned the game in their favor. ""We kind of let up the second quarter going into the half,"" the Bucks Eric Bledsoe said. ""They cut it to one and we kind of let up then. We never could get our rhythm back."" Toronto opened the third with a 26-12 run, capped by Siakam's turnaround bank hook for a 63-57 lead at the 10:05 mark. ""What helped us was the beginning of that third quarter,"" Leonard said. ""We came out in the first two minutes playing well, getting stops, getting some open looks. We kept moving from there."" Antetokounmpo tried to rally the Bucks in the fourth when he scored eight points on a pair of 3s and a layup during a 14-4 run. His three-pointer gave Milwaukee a 96-95 lead with 8:12 to play, but the Raptors answered with a 15-2 surge capped by Siakam's wide-open 3 from the corner for a 110-98 lead with 5:14 to play. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 43 points and 18 rebounds, each stat one shy of his career-high. Malcolm Brogdon added 15 points and Middleton and Bledsoe each had 14. The Bucks had won five straight. Milwaukee was coming off a 144-112 victory over Atlanta on Friday night. TIP-INS Raptors: C Jonas Valanciunas (left thumb dislocation) missed his 11th consecutive game. G Kyle Lowry (lower back pain) missed his sixth straight game. ... The last time Lowry and Leonard played together was Dec. 9 against Milwaukee. Bucks: F Ersan Ilyasova scored three points in 13:23 minutes in his second game back from broken nose. ... G Sterling Brown was back after missing one game with a right ankle injury. STATS Leanard has seven games of 30 or more points on 50.0 percent shooting or better. The Bucks lead the season series 2-1 with one more game remaining in Toronto on Jan. 31. NICE TURNAROUND Toronto had a day to rest following a 125-107 loss to the Spurs on Thursday night in Leonard's return to San Antonio. ""Tonight, executed everything in our game plan defensively and one game (Spurs) we didn't execute any of it,"" Toronto's head coach Nick Nurse said. ""Also, (we) played with some juice and some physicality. That is the way we need to play if you want to be a serious contender.""","401071256"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs could have been excused for a letdown two days after their most emotional victory of the season. Then again, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich gives no quarter and neither did his team. Derrick White scored 19 points, LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 and the Spurs overcame a sluggish start to beat Memphis 108-88 on Saturday night, handing the Grizzlies their fifth straight loss. Popovich only offered a dismissive look when asked if he was worried about a letdown following the Spurs' 125-107 victory in Kawhi Leonard's return to San Antonio on Thursday. The frenzied environment that overwhelmed the Raptors was absent, but the Spurs energized themselves and the crowd. ""Definitely a different atmosphere,"" White said. ""We just had to bring it within the locker room. I think we kind of got off to a slow start, but we picked it up there and got the win."" San Antonio won for the 12th time in 15 games and is 4 1/2 games out of first in the Western Conference after dropping to 14th in December. Mike Conley had 21 points in 25 minutes for Memphis, which has dropped to 12th in the West. Jaren Jackson and Dillon Brooks, who added 15 points apiece, were the only other Grizzlies in double figures. The Grizzlies outscored the Spurs 20-11 to start the fourth quarter, trimming a 24-point lead. Memphis pulled within 95-86 with 5 minutes remaining on Brooks' third 3-pointer, but San Antonio's starters reclaimed a double-digit lead. ""That's the NBA, it goes back and forth,"" Popovich said. ""Forty-eight minutes is a long time to play. You're going to have different periods. You've just got to hang in."" The Spurs started the game 1 for 6 and did not collect their initial basket until more than two minutes into the game. San Antonio got going following a timeout by Popovich, outscoring Memphis 19-10 to end the first quarter and then by 18 in the second to take a 64-44 lead at the half. White had nine points in the first quarter and finished 8-for-9 shooting. ""He's been playing great lately,"" said Spurs reserve Jakob Poeltl, who had 11 points. ""Been doing a lot of things for us."" The Grizzlies finished with 21 turnovers, which led to 26 points. Memphis entered the game averaging 13.6 turnovers. ""When you're playing a team that is this good, any time you lose or miss out on possessions with opportunities for shots, it's hard to overcome,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""For us, we're not a normally a high-turnover team, but they were active with their hands."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Justin Holiday scored two points in 20 minutes in his debut with Memphis after being acquired from Chicago in a trade Thursday for MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden. ... Conley was listed as probable with a sore left shoulder but was cleared to play before pregame workouts. ... Gasol played after testing a sore left hamstring prior to the game. ... The Grizzlies' season low for the second quarter is 11 points, which they were held to against Houston on Dec. 15.

The Spurs outscored the Grizzlies by 18 points in the second quarter, which is their largest point differential in the second. ROAD WORRIER San Antonio opens a two-game road trip Monday at Detroit. The Spurs know they must improve on the road, where they are 6-12 this season compared to a 17-5 record at home. ""We have to,"" Aldridge said. ""To be one of the elite teams in the league, you have to take it on the road. We've gotten better the last couple of trips. We just have to keep getting better every trip.""","401071257"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Portland's Evan Turner knew what he was up against with James Harden. Harden had scored 40-plus points in his previous five games and was coming off consecutive triple-doubles. Turner, charged with Harden from the start, stopped that streak and managed to slow him -- a bit. Harden finished with 38 points and the Trail Blazers snapped Houston's six-game winning streak with a 110-101 victory on Saturday night. ""I just had to be aggressive and try to limit what he likes to do. He's an amazing offensive player, he's been on a hell of a run and obviously he's the head of the snake, so I just tried to pick him up, wear him down, tire him out and not try to get any cheap fouls,"" Turner said. Harden was 13 of 35 from the field, and shot 5 of 17 from 3-point range, overcoming a slow first half that ended with just nine points. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said Harden is clearly on another level. ""It's unbelievable. Now you grade him on that he wasn't very sharp tonight, he only had 38. Now if he doesn't get 40 it's like, `What's wrong with him?"" D'Antoni said. Portland coach Terry Stotts weighed in: ""Well, we held him under 40 so I guess that's a win."" Jusuf Nurkic had 25 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Blazers. CJ McCollum added 24 points and Damian Lillard finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds for Portland's third win in the past four games. Portland led by as many as 16 points in the third quarter, but Harden started to show some life after a surprisingly cold first half. Gerald Green's dunk got Houston within 88-83 early in the fourth but Nurkic's layup pushed Portland's lead to 97-85 with just under 6 minutes left. After Harden collected his fourth foul, McCollum hit a long jumper to put Portland up 101-90 with 3:10 remaining. Turner's layup and free throw made it 106-95 and Moda Center fans started heading for the doors. There was some controversy when Harden got three free throws on Turner's foul that appeared to be on P.J. Tucker, and he made all three to close the gap with 1:02 left. After Lillard made a free throw on the other end, Harden's step-back jumper got the Rockets within 107-101 with 34 seconds left -- but it was a close as they could get. Harden missed a layup with 15 seconds left that would have put him at 40 points. ""My shots were flat at the beginning of the game but I picked it up in that third quarter and the second half. I've just got to get off to a better start,"" he said. Portland was the last team to hold Harden under 30. He had 29 in Houston's 111-104 home victory on Dec. 11. Maurice Harkless had some success guarding Harden, but he out with a sore left knee after a loss to the Thunder on Friday and Turner made his second start of the season. Harden had his 11th career triple-double and made the go-ahead 3-pointer in a 135-134 overtime victory over Golden State on Thursday night. He finished with 44 points, 10 rebounds and 15 assists. Neither team was able to make much of a move until the final two minutes of the half, when Portland went up 54-46 on Turner's layup. Nene was charged with a flagrant foul on Nurkic, who made one of the two free throws then added a basket. Lillard had a floater before time ran out and the Blazers went to the break with a 59-46 lead. Harden was 0 for 8 from 3-point range in the opening half. It was just the second time this season he failed to reach double digits in the first half. Lillard's 3-pointer pushed Portland's lead to 77-61, but Harden answered with his own. Harden had 20 points in the third quarter but the Blazers led 86-77 going into the final period. Austin Rivers scored a season-high 21 points for Houston, while Clint Capela had 13 points and 21 rebounds. TIP-INS Rockets: It was the third and final meeting of the season between the teams. They split the first two. ... Harden hit his first two 3-point attempts in the second half. ... The five-game streak with 40-plus points was the longest of his career. It was tied for the NBA's third-longest streak dating back to the 1972-73 season. Trail Blazers: Nurkic has 20 double-doubles. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Warriors still aren't playing championship-level defense and they're committing too many turnovers for coach Steve Kerr's liking. That might be nitpicking, especially on a night when Golden State and Sacramento set an NBA record for combined 3-pointers, but it's a concern for the two-time defending champs nevertheless. Not that it bothered Stephen Curry much. Curry scored 20 of his 42 points in the fourth quarter and had 10 3-pointers, and the Warriors held on to beat the Kings 127-123 on Saturday night. ""At the end of the day we know in order to win a championship we have to get stops, and we did that in the fourth quarter,"" Curry said. ""The 3s that they were getting were mostly in transition and on breakdowns, just not communicating, and obviously they made us pay by making them."" Kevin Durant added 29 points, nine assists and five rebounds, and Klay Thompson scored 20 points to help the Warriors take a 3-0 lead in the season series. The three games have been decided by a total of 10 points. ""Just an incredible offensive display by both teams,"" Kerr said. ""The problem for us was the (13) turnovers. Every time we turned the ball over it was a 3 or a dunk. That's what kept them in the game."" Coming off a 135-134 overtime loss to Houston on Thursday night when they let a 20-point lead slip away, the Warriors blew another big lead in the third quarter before storming past the Kings over the final 12 minutes. Curry led the way with five 3s in the fourth, and had a pair of key three-point plays. Curry also closed out the quarter with a pair of free throws with 9.4 seconds left. That ended a frenzied game in which the teams combined for 41 3-pointers. Golden State shot 21 of 47 beyond the arc while Sacramento was 20 of 36. The 20 3s were a franchise record for the Kings. ""It's a fun way to play, especially when you're shooting a high percentage,"" Curry said. ""You can shoot as many 3s as you want to but shooting a high percentage the way it was tonight on both ends was pretty crazy."" Buddy Hield scored 32 points on a career-high eight 3s for Sacramento. Justin Jackson added a career-high 28 points, and Willie Cauley-Stein had 14 points and 13 rebounds. ""I hope it was fun to watch,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""At the end they just clamped down and kept us in front, forcing tough shots."" The teams exchanged 15-0 runs in the first half. Golden State made four consecutive 3-pointers, including a four-point play by Quinn Cook, and Durant soared through the key for an emphatic two-handed dunk that put the Warriors up 37-22 in the first quarter. The Kings made their surge in the second behind 3s. Sacramento trailed by 16, but pulled to 70-69 in the first half. TIP-INS Warriors: Durant needs two blocks to reach 900 for his career. ... Golden State shot 8 of 11 beyond the arc in the first quarter. ... Cook scored 10 points in 9 1/2 minutes off the bench. Kings: Hield had five 3s in the third when Sacramento turned an 81-73 deficit into a 103-96 lead. ... Marvin Bagley III is expected to resume basketball activities within the next 10-14 days. The second overall pick in the draft, Bagley has been out since Dec. 14 with a bruised bone in his left knee. ... Iman Shumpert was held out with a sprained right index finger. PARDON ME? The game was paused briefly when Durant suffered a minor cut, but the Warriors star forward raised his eyebrow when the Golden1 Center announcer said the timeout was because of infectious disease control. ""Me and that guy have a great relationship,"" Durant said. ""He threw me off when he said that because I had never heard that in an arena before."" HE SAID IT ""We were not too far off, just a couple of possessions. They sensed it. But it's going to come. It might not be this year, but maybe next year."" -- Hield, on the Kings closing the gap with the Warriors.","401071259"
"CHICAGO --  D'Angelo Russell is on a roll, and so are the Brooklyn Nets. Russell scored 28 points, DeMarre Carroll had 20 points off the bench and the Nets beat the Chicago Bulls 117-100 on Sunday for their third straight victory. Jarrett Allen added 19 and six rebounds as the Nets improved to 12-3 in their last 15 games, matching their best 15-game stretch since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. Russell topped 20 points for the fourth straight game and is averaging 26.5 points in the span. ""D'Angelo is just taking it to a whole other level,"" Carroll said. ""He's getting everybody involved, he's scoring the ball when he needs to. ""He's got a complete game right now and I think that's what we need from him in order to go far and go deep."" Brooklyn (20-21) didn't win its 20th game last season until Feb. 26, also against Chicago. The Bulls (10-30) lost their fourth straight overall and fifth in a row to the Nets. The Nets, who finished 28-54 last season and in 12th place in the East, are in the running for their first playoff berth since 2014-15. ""We've been playing at a good level,"" Russell said. ""Just taking care of what we're supposed to take care of. Giving ourselves a chance when the numbers aren't in our favor. Our confidence is high."" The Nets made 16 3-pointers. Russell was 6 for 14 from beyond the arc. ""They made shots,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""They got to where they wanted to get to. And they made shots. We can't give up 117 at home.""

Kris Dunn added 16 points, but the Nets pulled away in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Bulls 29-18. ""They hit a lot of 3s, but we played good and we battle them,"" LaVine said. ""But overall as a team, we've just got to be tougher."" Both teams started slowly with the Bulls hitting just one of their first eight shots and the Nets connecting on just three of 10. But with Carroll kicking in nine points, Brooklyn moved ahead 28-21 after the first quarter. The Nets opened a 12-point lead when Russell hit a 3-pointer 58 seconds into the second quarter. Led by energized play from LaVine and Porter, the Bulls roared back to briefly take a one-point lead before the half, then settle for a 55-all tie at halftime. LaVine had 16 points and Portis had nine in the second quarter. LaVine made five straight baskets -- four on driving layups, plus a 3-pointer -- in a 3  1/2-minute stretch to put the Bulls back in the game. Russell had 10 points and Allen had nine at the half, then both kicked into a higher offensive gear to start the third as the Nets pulled out to a another 12-point lead midway through the quarter. Russell hit three straight 3-pointers in 2:31 stretch. The Nets settled for an 88-82 lead entering the fourth quarter, then used a 16-5 run to seal the victory as Russell kept rolling. TIP-INS Nets: The Nets recorded their 10th road win, something they didn't do last season until March 28. . Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (right adductor strain) missed his third straight game. Swingman Allen Crabbe (sore right knee) sat out his 11th. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Slowly but surely, the Minnesota Timberwolves have begun to find their way behind franchise cornerstones Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. The next step in their development will be adjusting to another new coach. Wiggins scored 25 of his 28 points in the first half and Towns had 28 points and 18 rebounds, helping the Timberwolves take charge from the opening tipoff and breeze by the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers 108-86 on Sunday before coach Tom Thibodeau was fired . Jeff Teague scored all of his 15 points in the first half and finished with 11 assists for the Wolves, who raised their home record to 14-6, including 8-2 against Western Conference foes. Despite the team's fourth-largest margin of victory in 2018-19, Thibodeau was dismissed about an hour afterward near the halfway point of his third season in charge that started with turmoil surrounding the discontent of All-Star Jimmy Butler. The Wolves (19-21) moved into 11th place in the conference, two games behind the eighth-place Lakers (21-19). The Wolves are 15-12 since Butler was traded to Philadelphia. Their defense produced season bests in points (86) and field goal percentage (36.8) allowed. ""Every game now counts,"" said Wiggins, whose five highest point totals this season have all come in the last 20 games. ""You never know what position you're going to be in at the end so every day you have to play like you're fighting for your life."" Lance Stephenson had 14 points for the Lakers, who fell to 1-5 without James since he strained his groin during the Christmas Day win at Golden State. With backup point guard Rajon Rondo (right ring finger surgery) and power forward Kyle Kuzma (bruised lower back) missing again, too, the leftovers for the Lakers produced a mostly lethargic performance. This was their largest losing margin in 20 games since a 117-85 defeat at Denver on Nov. 27. ""We weren't physical enough,"" point guard Lonzo Ball. ""That's a big, strong team over there, and I don't think we brought the fight tonight."" Lakers coach Luke Walton subbed the 7-foot-1 Ivica Zubac in the starting lineup for Kuzma next to 7-footer JaVale McGee, and the experiment led to a 15-1 deficit before Michael Beasley replaced Zubac. The Lakers missed their first eight shots from the floor, until Beasley's baseline reverse layup. The Wolves built their first-half lead as large as 21 points, when a slick over-the-shoulder backward flip pass by Towns in the post on a give-and-go set up Wiggins for a soaring dunk and a 28-7 advantage. He went even higher in the second quarter to catch a textbook lob from Tyus Jones after sneaking behind Zubac with a backdoor cut for the slam and a 39-21 lead. ""We've got to play with some passion and fire,"" Walton said. ""It's hard to win in this league when you're healthy. You've got to give double that effort when guys are down."" WIGGINS, FOR THE WIN Wiggins, whose first season on his maximum-salary contract as a $25 million player has been hit and miss to match the so-far uneven trajectory of his career, has been exhibiting an abundance of confidence in his jumpers lately, and that trust clearly paid off for him and the Timberwolves in this matinee. He made five shots from 15 feet or further before halftime, picking up a loose ball and calmly dribbling to the perimeter to sink a 3-pointer with 12 seconds remaining to make it 64-45. ""It's awesome,"" Towns said. ""You've got a front-row seat to watch `Maple Jordan' go to work. It's always great when he's going off. When he's doing what he was doing in the first half tonight, it makes it easier for all of us offensively."" TIP-INS Lakers: The starting lineup was outscored 91-34, with Brandon Ingram (13 points) and Josh Hart (10 points) going a combined 8 for 28 from the floor. ... Beasley had 11 points on 5-for-8 shooting, his second game in double digits this season. Timberwolves: Wiggins raised his career average against the Lakers to 23 points per game, his fourth-highest against the rest of the league. His best is against the club that drafted and traded him, Cleveland (25.6), and after that is Toronto (24.0), his hometown team. Sacramento (23.7) is his third-highest. ... The Wolves are 5-0 when holding opponents below 40 percent shooting from the field. STILL OUT The Timberwolves remained short-handed, too, with two of their top four scorers in Robert Covington (right knee bone bruise) and Derrick Rose (sprained right ankle) still out with injuries. Covington, who missed his third straight game, is out indefinitely, with more clarity on his status not expected next week, according to Thibodeau. Rose sat for the fifth consecutive contest, but he was listed as questionable and considered close to a return, Thibodeau said.","401071261"
"LOS ANGELES --  Typically the lead runner on the Los Angeles Clippers' four-quarter relay squad, Tobias Harris forced his team into a change of plans -- and the adjustment worked out just fine Sunday. Harris, one of the NBA's top first-quarter scorers, started slow but still ended up with 28 points and the Clippers overcame a sluggish opening to beat the Orlando Magic 106-96 on Sunday. Harris, who entered with the fifth most first-quarter points at 286, was 0 for 6 from the field in the opening 12 minutes with zero points. ""In all seriousness, I settle in and just take the pressure off myself with the missed shots and just focus on the team,"" Harris said. The Clippers trailed by 10 after one quarter, when they shot 7 of 26, and by 15 in the second quarter before wearing down the Magic from there. Los Angeles outscored the Magic by eight points in the second quarter and by 12 points in the second half. Lou Williams added 17 points, and Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each had 13. The Clippers have won 11 consecutive games against the Magic, a streak that goes back to the 2013-14 season. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 24 rebounds for Orlando. Aaron Gordon added 17 points, and D.J. Augistine and Evan Fournier each had 12. The Magic have lost two straight and seven of 10, and are 1/3 on a six-game trip. ""I'll be honest, without watching the film, and I'm not really like this, but we missed a bunch of wide-open shots,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""I think there were drives in the lane that we have to make to beat a team as good as they are while on the road. Our spot-up 3s, they don't go in the basket and it made us hesitant."" Vucevic had 11 rebounds in the first quarter to help the Magic take a 28-18 lead, but they blew a double-digit first-half lead for the second consecutive game after falling at Minnesota on Friday night. ""We just couldn't make shots,"" Vucevic said. ""I feel like we had a good amount of good looks we just didn't make. I thought our defense was pretty good, for the most part, we just couldn't make enough shots. We really struggled tonight."" Orlando led 47-45 at halftime, and the Clippers took their first lead just under two minutes into the second half on Marcin Gortat's turnaround basket. The Clippers struggled from the field in the opening quarter, shooting just 7 of 26. Orlando led by as many as 15 points before the Clippers rallied with a half-ending 21-12 run. The Magic, though, made one last push. Orlando pulled even at 72 with just over 10 minutes remaining on Terrance Ross' three free throws, and the Clippers countered with a 17-2 run to take an 89-74 lead with 6:37 remaining. The start of the Clippers' decisive run included a five-point trip, when Montrezl Harrel was fouled on a dunk, missed the free throw, and Williams made a 3-pointer. ""I thought defensively we were playing well (early), but offensively we weren't making shots,"" Williams said. ""But when you (are a player that scores) you can't allow that to bother you and I think that showed. I think that tonight we had high attempts and probably had low field-goal percentages but we just continued to play and continued to show up."" After shooting 38.3-percent from the field in the first half, the Clippers went 47.8 percent in the second half to finish at 43 percent, well under their 45.7-percent mark for the season. The Magic was undone by their 34.1-percent shooting in the second half, including a 5-of-16 mark after halftime from 3-point range. ""I took two guys out because they were hesitant to shoot because they missed the open ones,"" Clifford said. ""You got to keep shooting. But I thought our effort was good enough."" GORTAT'S NATIONAL PRIDE Gortat scored eight points with 10 rebounds as the native of Poland received plenty of playing time while the Clippers celebrated Polish Heritage Day. He played a season-high 25 minutes. ""I felt like a lot of guys were trying to help me today and I truly appreciate getting a few more minutes,"" said Gortat, who addressed a large contingent of Polish fans estimated at 1,500 following the game. ""I'm glad I was able to help the team and the most important thing was (the) win. I don't care about my stat-line at the end."" TIP-INS Magic: Vucevic had his team-leading 26th double-double. He led the Magic in rebounds for the 30th time this season. ... After the Clippers went 13 of 26 from 3-point range in a victory at Orlando in November, Orlando held Los Angeles to 9 of 31 from distance Sunday. Clippers: The last time the Clippers lost to the Magic was a 98-90 decision at Orlando on Nov. 6, 2013. ... The Clippers' rough first quarter against the Magic came after playing one of their best first quarters Friday when they outscored the Suns 38-19 in an eventual victory. ...

"ATLANTA --  Trae Young reached out to Dwyane Wade twice in hopes he'd get a signed jersey in the star's last game in Atlanta. Wade, whose son Zaire is friends with Young, gladly obliged. ""I texted him and I was like, `I need it for the last time in the ATL,"" Young said. ""He said, `I already got it planned.' It was cool to talk to him."" Young scored 19 points, John Collins had 13 points and 13 rebounds, and the Hawks snapped a three-game skid with a 106-82 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday night. Perhaps it helped Wade get over the Heat's worst performance of the season. Coming off two straight wins that had moved it over .500 for the first time since Oct. 27, Miami was listless all night against a rebuilding team missing its second- and third-leading scorers and lost for the third time to an opponent that has just 12 victories. ""It was a bad game for us,"" Wade said. ""We're 0-3 versus this team. They've figured out a way to make us not play our game. I don't know what it is. Ask them."" DeAndre' Bembry finished with 17 points in a starting role, and Jeremy Lin came off the bench to add 15 for Atlanta. Young, the NBA's fifth overall draft pick, had some dazzling moves handling the ball, but he finished with just two assists. His skills were still enough to impress Wade. ""He's got a great relationship with my son, which I appreciate,"" Wade said. ""And he's somebody whose game, you know, honestly, I look at him, I talk to him on different occasions, respect to him. A lot of people said a lot of things about Trae. He's got a long career ahead of him."" Derrick Jones Jr. led Miami with 14 points, Justise Winslow scored 13 and Wade and Josh Richardson each had 11 for the Heat, who seemed disinterested in defending after the Hawks jumped to a comfortable lead late in the third. Miami missed 20 of its first 22 attempts beyond the arc before Wade hit his 500th career 3-pointer. He joined Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only players in NBA history with at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 3s. The matchup seemed heavily in Miami's favor with the Hawks coming off a 32-point loss at Milwaukee, but the Heat struggled throughout the first half, going 1 for 16 on 3s, getting outrebounded 33-24 and committing 10 turnovers that led to 11 Atlanta points. It only got worse in the third as the Heat kept whiffing and Atlanta jumped to a 19-point lead on consecutive 3s by Daniel Hamilton and Lin. Lin followed with consecutive runners. The Hawks jumped out to an 18-6 lead, but Miami was up 33-31 in the second when Rodney McGruder hit a layup. The Heat did not lead again. TIP-INS Heat: G Dion Waiters is still far from 100 percent. He missed his second straight game since making his first appearance in over a year when the Heat won at Cleveland last Wednesday. Waiters, who played that game because Wade was sidelined by a virus, is still limited by a sore left ankle that required surgery last January. Hawks: With G Kent Bazemore out the next two weeks with a right ankle injury, Bembry made his third start. Hamilton started in Friday's blowout loss at Milwaukee. ... Lin had his 500th career steal. CLOTHING EXCHANGE Even though he had to lobby for the jersey, Young got what he wanted, and so did Wade. Wade, the 12-time All-Star who's retiring after the season, brought a jersey he'd signed beforehand and gave it to him at halfcourt. Young took his jersey off, signed it and gave it to Wade. ""I've been able to swap jerseys with a lot of veterans in the league, but it's good when the younger guys come in and they want your jersey as well,"" Wade said. ""I'm honored. I'm ready to watch his career for a long time. As I let him know, we'll make sure we get some work in together and I want to put him and my son together."" SHOWING WADE LOVE The Hawks showed a video tribute to Wade early in the first quarter. He received a standing ovation, smiled and waved to the crowd. It didn't take Wade long to stir excitement when entered the game a few minutes later. He flipped a backward pass over his shoulder to assist on Jones' dunk and took a pass on the baseline to hit a double-pump reverse layup that cut the lead to 23-16. ""Just trying to do something for the fans tonight,"" he said. ""Probably the only moments we gave them to cheer for."" After the game ended and he walked off the court holding Young's jersey, Wade stopped to another standing ovation on one end of the arena. He signed some autographs, smiled and headed into the tunnel.","401071263"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Washington coach Scott Brooks thinks his team delivered one of its best performances of the season on Sunday night. That's what it took for the Wizards to finally win in Oklahoma City. Bradley Beal scored 25 points and Washington won 116-98, beating the Thunder franchise on the road for the first time since it was still based in Seattle. The Thunder started the day with the second-best record in the Western Conference while Washington was nine games under .500 and still adjusting to losing star guard John Wall for the season. Those factors made the win sweeter for Brooks, the former Thunder coach. ""It has to be up there, there's no question,"" he said. ""We battled. We played against one of the best teams in basketball. They've got a lot of talent. They've got three All-Stars on the floor and I think we battled them and did a lot of things well."" Otto Porter had 20 points, six rebounds and five assists, Jeff Green scored 16 points and Tomas Satoransky added 15 for the Wizards, who had been 0-9 against the Thunder in Oklahoma City, where they moved in 2008. Porter had been playing sparingly since coming back from a right knee contusion. He came off the bench and made 7 of 17 shots and 4 of 6 3-pointers. ""I am still trying to get the rust off,"" he said. ""Coming off the bench allows me to add scoring coming off the bench. I'm doing whatever I can."" Porter started every game he played the previous two seasons, but Brooks is considering keeping him in a reserve role. ""Otto just wants to play and play well and play the right way,"" Brooks said. ""If we keep him there for a while, who knows. But we have been playing some good basketball. I know we haven't won every game, but we've been playing hard, and we have to keep doing it. But he has a nice rhythm coming off the bench the last few games."" Russell Westbrook had 22 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists for his 12th triple-double of the season and the 116th of his career. But he also had eight turnovers. Washington had nine as a team. ""We turned the ball over too much, at least I did,"" Westbrook said. ""That's the story of the game."" Paul George scored 20 points and Jerami Grant added 17 for the Thunder, who had won their previous three games. The Wizards led 54-50 at halftime, but the Thunder quickly took a 55-54 lead in the third quarter on a layup by Grant. Washington regained control. Porter's 3-pointer capped a 15-2 run that put the Wizards up 80-69 with just under 3 minutes left in the third quarter. The Wizards led 90-79 at the end of the period. Sam Dekker's emphatic reverse dunk put the Wizards up 96-81 with about 10 minutes to play. A 3-pointer by Green pushed Washington's lead to 20. The Thunder don't plan to dwell on the loss. ""I know we had right intentions and that's all that matters,"" Westbrook said. ""We've got a positive locker room and I'm optimistic about what the future holds for this team, so it's all good."" TIP-INS Wizards: Brooks was cheered during pregame introductions. He coached the Thunder from 2008-15 and led them to the NBA Finals in 2012. ... The Wizards outrebounded the Thunder 55-41. ... George had scored 37 points in each of his previous two games, but he shot 7 for 18 on Sunday night. ... Beal took 27 shots to get his 25 points. ... F Trevor Ariza made just 1 of 9 shots. Thunder: Reserve G Alex Abrines missed his fourth straight game due to personal reasons. ... Westbrook had eight turnovers. ... C Steven Adams scored 10 points in the first quarter and two the rest of the game. STAT LINES The Thunder were outscored by 32 points during backup point guard Dennis Schroder's 17 minutes. He scored nine points on 3-for-10 shooting. HE SAID IT Westbrook on the off night for the team: ""Eighty-two games. You think you're going to play good every night, you've got another thing coming.""","401071264"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry returned from injury to help the Toronto Raptors extend a run of home dominance over the Indiana Pacers. Norman Powell scored a season-high 23 points, Pascal Siakam had 12 points and 10 rebounds, and the Raptors beat Indiana 121-105 on Sunday night, snapping the Pacers' six-game winning streak. Serge Ibaka scored 18 points, while Lowry had 12 points and eight assists after missing the previous six games because of a sore lower back. ""He's a big piece of what we're tying to do here,"" Powell said. ""It seemed like he hasn't missed a beat."" Kawhi Leonard rested on the second night of a back-to-back, but Lowry played 32 minutes and shot 4 for 10, going 2 for 6 from 3-point range. ""Good to be out there with my guys,"" Lowry said. ""It felt good to be able to help them get a win."" The Pacers lost their 11th consecutive game north of the border. Indiana's most recent win Toronto was March 1, 2013. Lowry also had three steals and three rebounds, and took a pair of charges. ""There's about 32 other things out there that you're not seeing that he's doing that don't get recorded on the stat sheet,"" coach Nick Nurse said. Danny Green scored 15 points and Fred VanVleet had 12 as the Raptors returned from a victory in Milwaukee on Saturday to win their fifth straight at home. Powell made 10 of 12 shots and scored 11 points in the final quarter. ""He was really good tonight,"" Nurse said. Green matched his season high with five 3-pointers and Toronto hit 17 of 33 from long range, one shy of its season best. ""They were the aggressors all night long,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We never really established that we could stop them."" It was the fifth time this season the Raptors have faced a team that had won at least five straight games. Toronto is now 3-2 in such encounters, also beating Miami on Dec. 26 and Milwaukee on Saturday. ""Hopefully this will be an eye-opener for us, and realize we've got a lot of work to do if we want to get to where we want to be,"" Indiana's Victor Oladipo said. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 21 points, Domantas Sabonis had 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Oladipo scored 16 points for Indiana. The Pacers have lost five straight and 14 of the past 16 against the Raptors. Thaddeus Young scored 14 points and Darren Collison had 11. Indiana has won 13 of its past 16, losing twice to Toronto and once to Cleveland in that span. The Raptors rallied from a 17-point deficit to beat the Pacers 99-96 on Dec. 19. ""This is a tough place to play,"" McMillan said. ""They make it a tough place to play, and we haven't had success here in a number of years."" Both teams shot better than 60 percent in the first quarter but the Raptors made six of nine attempts from 3-point range to lead 37-35. Powell scored 10 points in the second and Toronto led 70-63 at halftime. Ibaka had 10 in the third as the Raptors took a 96-84 edge into the final quarter. ""Everybody was wide open tonight,"" McMillan said. TIP-INS Pacers: C Myles Turner (right shoulder) was not available. Sabonis made his second start of the season. ... All five starters scored at least 10 points. Raptors: Powell's career high is 30, set at Brooklyn on April 13, 2016. ... Lowry and Leonard have played together in 21 of Toronto's 42 games. ... Lowry had not played since Dec. 22 at Philadelphia. He missed the four games before that because of a sore left thigh. BENCH BOUNCES BACK Toronto got more bench points in the first quarter (six) than it did in all of Saturday's win at Milwaukee (five). The Raptors finished with 52 bench points. ""We talked about coming out and setting a tone, bringing the energy and playing our game,"" Powell said. KAWHI RESTS Leonard has been held out of at least one game of all eight back-to-backs so far this season, one year after being limited to nine games with San Antonio because of a quadriceps injury.","401071265"
"PHOENIX -- Kemba Walker didn't have much of an impact in Charlotte's game Sunday night against the Phoenix Suns -- until the final 4 1/2 minutes. Then he was the Hornets' everything. Walker scored 18 of his 29 points in that late surge -- punctuated by a halfcourt heave at the buzzer -- and Charlotte pulled away to hand the Suns their sixth straight loss, 119-113. ""This isn't anything new,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""He's done this most of his career. He's a fourth-quarter player. He shines brightest in those moments."" Walker scored his team's final 14 points. ""In these kind of situations my teammates look to me to make big plays and that is what I try to do,"" he said. ""I try to make the right plays. Tonight was me getting to the basket and finishing. My guys, coaches, they count on me big time in situations like this."" Tony Parker added 20 points, and Willy Hernangomez and Marvin Williams 16 for the Hornets. T.J. Warren had 23 points, Josh Jackson a season-high 22 and Deandre Ayton 19 for Phoenix. Jamal Crawford scored 16. The Suns' Devin Booker left the game with back spasms in the second quarter and did not return. Phoenix fell to 0-6 with one game left on a seven-game homestand. The Suns had won five of seven when the homestand began. The Hornets were on the second stop in a season-high, six-game road trip that began with a loss at Denver on Saturday night. Walker was 5 of 8 from the field and 7 of 8 on free throws in his late surge, which ended with a basket at the final buzzer from just beyond midcourt. Initially it was waived off but allowed after a video review. ""I always said Kemba is one of the most underrated players in the league, even with making a couple of All-Stars,"" Crawford said. ""He's just a handful and a guy like that, once he gets it going, he's pretty much unstoppable."" Charlotte outscored Phoenix 11-4 over the last 1:17, with Walker scoring all of them, after Crawford's 20-footer put Phoenix up 109-108 with 1:21 to play. Neither team led by more than eight points in the tight contest. ""Losing Devin Booker in the first half kind of changed the game plan,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""He's a big piece, he's a big part of our team. We had to adjust on the fly and kept the game close."" Kokoskov said he didn't know about Booker's availability for Tuesday's game against Sacramento. There were 13 ties and eight lead changes in the first half, with neither team up by more than six points, and the Suns were ahead 60-57 at the break. Ayton had 15 points and seven rebounds in the first half. Charlotte took an 85-81 into the fourth quarter before the Suns tied it 85-85 on De'Anthony Melton's 3-pointer from the corner with 11:02 to play. Parker started the subsequent 8-0 run with a layup and ended it with a 16-footer that put Charlotte up 93-85 with 8:55 to play. The Suns came back and repeatedly cut the lead to one before Crawford's basket finally gave them the lead. But four seconds later, Walker converted a three-point play and the Hornets were back on top for good. TIP INS Hornets: Charlotte swept the season series with Phoenix 2-0 last season. ... Walker ranks second to LeBron James in fourth-quarter scoring at 8.27 points per game. The Suns' Booker is third (7.50). ... Charlotte doesn't play another home game until Jan. 17 (Sacramento). ... The Hornets won for just the third time in nine games. Suns: Crawford joined Dell Curry as the only NBA players, since starting lineups were recorded, with 11,000 career points as reserves. ... Booker's back problem brought an end to 11 consecutive 20-point games for the Phoenix star guard, the second-longest such streak of his career. ... Phoenix entered the game fourth in the NBA in steals at 8.98 per game.","401071266"
"DETROIT --  San Antonio was already down eight points when the Spurs took a timeout around the midway point of the first quarter. Then, after a turnover led to a Detroit dunk, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called another timeout, just 14 seconds after the first. ""Just mental errors, mental errors defensively, and gave them some easy buckets,"" San Antonio guard Bryn Forbes said. ""I don't know if it was to slow the run, but kind of get our head on right -- kind of slow their pace there."" The Spurs responded well after those early problems, taking the lead by halftime and cruising to a 119-107 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points, and Popovich moved another step higher on the NBA's career wins list. Popovich now has 1,221 victories. He's tied with Jerry Sloan for third place, trailing only Don Nelson and Lenny Wilkens. ""I thought after the first quarter, we competed well, we were sharper and we executed better,"" Popovich said. ""We had a poor first quarter, but I thought we pulled it together and focused pretty well after that."" The Spurs trailed 19-9 after the second of those two timeouts, but they appeared to get the message. A 23-2 run spanning parts of the first and second quarters put the Spurs up 45-33. It was relatively smooth sailing from there for San Antonio, which led 59-51 at halftime and 84-73 after three quarters. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 25 points for the Spurs. Blake Griffin scored 34 for Detroit, and Andre Drummond added 19 points and 14 rebounds. ""Everyone talked about the regime ending in San Antonio, but they still have two Hall of Fame players in LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan and they are obviously a well-coached team,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I thought we got off to a great start, but their second unit came in and speeded things up. We didn't match it. We have to be able to pump the gas at the start of the second quarter."" San Antonio was without forward Rudy Gay, out with a sprained left wrist, but the Spurs still won a season-high fifth straight game. Detroit has lost seven of nine. Popovich said Gay would likely miss the next two games as well. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio came in averaging 12.3 turnovers per game, the lowest mark in the league. The Spurs had only nine against Detroit. ... DeRozan also had nine assists and seven rebounds. ... San Antonio went 26 of 32 on free throws, while Detroit was 14 of 17. ... The Spurs remained percentage points behind Houston for the top spot in the Southwest Division. Pistons: Detroit was without backup C Zaza Pachulia (right lower leg contusion). ANOTHER LIST It was the 518th road victory for Popovich, breaking a tie with Nelson for second on that career list. He's now two behind leader Pat Riley. LENGTHY STRETCH Drummond played the entire first quarter, plus the first 4:56 of the second. That didn't prevent San Antonio's big run. In addition to Pachulia, the Pistons are also without backup point guard Ish Smith (right adductor tear). ""Zaza and Ish are definitely missed, and I'm still trying to get adjusted to being out there with the second group,"" Drummond said. ""I've watched a lot of film of what they do, but I'm still working to find the best ways to get them involved and help them get into the best positions to score.""","401071267"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics shared the ball extremely well. The sloppy Brooklyn Nets helped them out a lot, too. Kyrie Irving returned after missing two games with an eye injury and scored 17 points to lead eight players in double figures as Boston beat the Nets 116-95 on Monday night. Jayson Tatum added 16 points, and Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart each scored 12 for the Celtics, who won their third straight game. The Celtics had 37 assists on 47 baskets. It was their fourth straight game with 30 or more assists. ""It's just moving the ball, moving the bodies, trying to create opportunities for one another,"" Irving said. ""It's good."" Horford said coach Brad Stevens emphasized passing before the game. ""Coach challenged us before the game to be great in that regard and try to really move the ball,"" he said. ""We did that tonight."" Rodions Kurucs led Brooklyn with 24 points. Spencer Dinwiddie had 15 and Kenneth Faried scored 13 with 12 rebounds. The Nets lost for just the fourth time in their last 16 games. Irving was out after scratching both corneas in a collision Dec. 31 at San Antonio. Playing on consecutive days, the Nets came out sloppy in the opening quarter, committing 11 turnovers -- about half coming on wild passes that sailed out of bounds. They ended up with a season-high 25. ""That was kind of the old Nets,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""That was a big problem of ours last year and the beginning of this year."" Trailing by 11 at halftime, Brooklyn sliced it to 59-54 early in the third quarter before the Celtics used a 17-9 spurt to pull ahead by 17 late in the period. Boston led 86-74 entering the final quarter and the Nets never threatened. ""They're a very cohesive group,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Obviously, they're one of the better teams in the Eastern Conference and they force a lot of turnovers. That obviously got them out in transition, got them easy buckets."" In the first half, Boston led by double digits at the end of the first quarter and opened a 47-27 advantage on Tatum's layup midway into the second en route to a 56-45 edge at halftime. TIP-INS Nets: Hit their first four shots -- all 3-point attempts -- but missed 25 of their next 30 overall. ... Former Boston College forward Jared Dudley and Connecticut guard Shabazz Napier both received a nice ovation when they were introduced. Celtics: Morris also returned after missing the previous game with a stiff neck. ... Boston swept all four games between the teams last season. PREGAME PRAISE Stevens spoke highly about the Nets before the game. ""I'd be surprised if this team's not in the playoffs. They're awfully good,"" he said of Brooklyn, which entered the day holding the Eastern Conference's seventh seed. ""I just love the way they play,"" Stevens added. ""They play hard and they play together. Everybody knows what they're supposed to do, and they do it every night."" I'M NOT IN YET Faried got off the bench, getting ready to check in, when Jarrett Allen fired a pass from on the court that bounced off Faried as he was heading to the scorer's table. Faried walked on the floor smiling when he got into the game.","401071268"
"HOUSTON --  With James Harden getting double-teamed almost every time he had the ball Monday night against the Denver Nuggets, he looked for other Houston Rockets to step up and make plays. Chief among them was Clint Capela, who set a career high with 31 points as the Rockets beat the Nuggets 125-113. ""He did what he was supposed to do,"" said Harden, who had 32 points. ""He finished. He played extremely well. Played hard."" P.J. Tucker set a career high with seven 3-pointers and scored a season-high 21 points to help Houston win for the 12th time in 14 games. Capela had 19 points by halftime as Harden fed him again and again. ""Whenever I'm under the rim and you put a little on me what's going to happen is that 99 or 100 percent of the time I'm going to dunk the ball,"" Capela said. ""This is what happened tonight and I did a great job of finishing aggressive under the rim."" Houston was up by 11 after two free throws by Torrey Craig with about 5 1/2 minutes left before Tucker and Harden made 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to make it 117-100 about a minute later. Gerald Green had 21 points and made six 3s on a night Houston made 22 3s for its sixth game this season with at least 20. ""We're just a real tough team when we're knocking down shots like that,"" Green said. Nikola Jokic scored 24 points for the Nuggets, who had a five-game winning streak snapped. ""Give them credit,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""You know Harden is going to get his, but when P.J. Tucker and Gerald Green score the amount of 3s that they made, I believe 13 combined, that's a tough one to overcome."" Harden had 14 assists, six 3-pointers and scored at least 30 points for the 13th straight game. ""He's probably the hardest guy in the NBA to guard,"" Malone said. Coach Mike D'Antoni enjoys watching the different things Harden does to help his team win night after night. ""Whatever they throw at him, he'll find the best play,"" D'Antoni said. ""He'll also find a way to score. He'll find his way, but he'll also get everyone involved."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone said Will Barton (hip) is making progress and could return in the next couple of weeks. ... Morris added 21 points off the bench. Rockets: Houston traded Michael Carter-Williams and cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls on Monday for a protected second-round pick in the 2020 draft. The Bulls then waived the guard following the trade. ... Chris Paul missed his eighth game in a row with a strained left hamstring. ... Eric Gordon missed his fourth straight game with a bruised right knee. WHAT A PLAY The Rockets led 70-60 at halftime after Harden made two 3-pointers in the last 90 seconds of the second quarter. The first of those shots is sure to show up on highlight reels, as Murray slipped and fell to the court trying to guard him before Harden stepped back for the basket. MAGIC NUMBER? With Monday's win the Rockets improved to 59-2 when scoring at least 120 points under D'Antoni. THEY SAID IT Jokic on Denver's struggles against Houston, which has won nine straight in the series: ""They beat us at our place and they beat us here. Last year, we didn't win one time, so that team gives us a problem, but we have to find a way to beat them and play (better) against them.""","401071269"
"MILWAUKEE --  After not playing at all in the Milwaukee Bucks' previous game, Thon Maker got a chance to shine in a hard-fought win over the Utah Jazz on Monday night. Maker had a season-high 15 points off the bench for the Bucks, who clamped down on defense in the second half to secure a 114-102 victory. ""We won the game because of him,"" said Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 30 points. ""He brought energy, played hard, he made shots. It was just amazing seeing Thon compete hard out there."" Maker had seen regular minutes off the bench recently with Ersan Ilyasova out with a broken nose. His playing time diminished after Ilyasova's return and the emergence of second-year player D.J. Wilson. ""That's when your professionalism comes in,"" Maker said. ""You've just got to stay ready whenever your name is called."" Maker shot 6 of 8 from the field, including 2 for 3 from beyond the arc. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said Maker's performance ""flipped the script."" ""He made a lot of different things happen on the court,"" Budenholzer said. ""I really feel like he was a difference-maker tonight."" Budenholzer specifically pointed to Maker's three-point play early in the fourth quarter after Utah had made a 3 on the other end. ""He was a spark plug for us,"" Brook Lopez said. ""He had such great energy and emotion. He got us going, he got the crowd going and everyone on the bench was going. We really fed off him tonight."" Malcolm Brogdon added 21 points for the Bucks, who were coming off a 123-116 loss to Toronto on Saturday night. Milwaukee improved to 28-11, the second-best record in the NBA. Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz, who lost starting point guard Ricky Rubio to a right hamstring injury less than five minutes into the game. He didn't return. ""We can't sulk,"" Mitchell said. ""We've got to go out there and compete."" The Jazz held a three-point advantage heading to the fourth quarter, but Milwaukee grabbed control late after Brogdon's 3-pointer pushed its lead to 105-99. The Bucks built the margin to eight with about three minutes left on two free throws by Lopez, who nailed a deep 3 about a minute later to give Milwaukee an 11-point cushion and seal the victory. Antetokounmpo, who grabbed 10 rebounds, fouled out with 42.9 seconds remaining. After a tightly contested first half, the Jazz opened an 11-point lead early in the third quarter before the Bucks stormed back, taking a lead late in the period when Brogdon hit back-to-back shots. Utah rebounded and led 86-83 heading into the fourth. The Jazz were up 62-58 at halftime, with Mitchell providing 15 points and Jae Crowder adding 11 off the bench. The first half featured 19 lead changes and eight ties. GETTING DEFENSIVE After allowing 62 points in the first half, the Bucks held the Jazz to 40 in the second half. ""We weren't very happy at halftime with our defense,"" Budenholzer said. ""The way we improved and got better in the second half gave us a chance to find a way offensively in the fourth quarter."" Utah scored just 16 points in the fourth quarter. ""We had some open looks,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We just weren't able to get them to go."" STAT LINE The Bucks scored 68 points in the paint to 36 for the Jazz. Milwaukee also had a 19-2 edge in fast-break points. BOUNCING BACK Milwaukee hasn't lost back-to-back games this season, improving to 11-0 after a loss. TIP-INS Jazz: Rubio scored nine points on 4-of-5 shooting before exiting. ...

Budenholzer said he is hopeful Wilson will be able to return Wednesday at Houston. ... G Donte DiVincenzo sat out with right ankle soreness.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis had little to say about his latest dunk-filled scoring outburst. He even shrugged off his seldom-seen ""Shammgod"" crossover dribble that stunned the Grizzlies, delighted the crowd and set up his thunderous driving dunk. The Pelicans' perennial All-Star was more eager to highlight an improved defensive performance that has given the Pelicans hope of stringing some victories together before the season gets away from them. Davis had 36 points, 13 rebounds and three blocked shots, and New Orleans pulled away for a 114-95 victory over reeling Memphis on Monday night. ""That's how we were able to be successful last year, by playing defense,"" Davis said. ""It leads us to get a lot of transition points, fast-break points and easy buckets, gets guys wide-open 3s and stuff like that."" Mike Conley had 22 points and 10 assists for Memphis, but that was not nearly enough to stem what is now a six-game slide. Second-year pro Frank Jackson scored a career-high 17 points for New Orleans, which has won two straight for the first time since winning three in a row in mid-November. New Orleans' latest victories have come against struggling teams in Memphis and Cleveland. But the Pelicans, who came in allowing 115.1 points per game and yielded 126 in a disheartening loss at Brooklyn last Wednesday, took a considerable measure of gratification from holding two straight foes under 100. ""It was a really good team win for us because I thought, defensively, the last two games, we've been really, really solid,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. New Orleans dominated inside, outscoring Memphis 70-42 in the paint and outrebounding the Grizzlies 40-36. Still, most of the game was competitive. There were 11 lead changes and nine ties, and neither team led by more than six until Julius Randle's dunk gave New Orleans an eight-point lead with five minutes left in the third. That was the beginning of the end for Memphis, which has lost 13 of 16 after winning 15 of its first 24 games. ""Things aren't going our way and teams are doing a good job of taking away what we are trying to do, so we have to figure out ways to play out of that,"" said Memphis center Marc Gasol, who was held to seven points on 3-of-10 shooting. ""Our confidence is really fragile and when something bad happens, especially in the second half, we kind of panic and a six- or eight-point deficit goes to 16. ... Everyone is giving their effort, but now we also have to put discipline and everything into it and help your brothers out."" Randle finished with 15 points for New Orleans, while Jrue Holiday scored 13 and Elfrid Payton 11. JaMychal Green scored 16 points for the Grizzlies. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 12 points. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Justin Holiday, who is Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday's younger brother, played in his second game for Memphis since being acquired from Chicago on Jan. 3. He scored four points -- all on free throws -- in 12:21 off the bench. ... Memphis turned the ball over 18 times, leading to 23 Pelicans points. Pelicans: Davis has at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in 11 straight. ... Wing player E'Twaun Moore was ruled out with bruised left thigh. ... Forward Nikola Mirotic missed his 12th straight game because of a right ankle injury, but Gentry said Mirotic could return soon. DAVIS' DUNKFEST Davis dunked seven times. His thunderous jam on a feed from Jahlil Okafor along the baseline gave New Orleans the first double-digit lead in the game for either team at 76-66 late in the third quarter. His last dunk came after he received an underhanded, no-look pass from Holiday as he cut down the lane. That made it 107-85 with a little more than three minutes left, and Davis checked out for good moments later. As for his ""Shammgod"" dribble, Davis said, ""I've got a lot of stuff in my bag. I just don't pull it out often."" JACKSON'S ACTION Jackson's fast-break layup late in the third quarter capped a 10-point outburst in a less than three-minute span that included two 3s and a reverse layup, putting the Pelicans up 83-71. The spurt highlighted a promising performance for Jackson, who missed his entire rookie season with an injury and is eager see if he can give the Pelicans more of the bench scoring they've needed. ""We're half-way through the season now,"" Jackson said. ""This is my first year and I think for sure it's slowed down a ton for me.""","401071271"
"DALLAS --  A challenge from their head coach gave Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball motivation. All they needed was an opening. The cold-shooting Dallas Mavericks provided it. Ingram scored 29 points and Ball added 21 as the Los Angeles Lakers handed the Mavericks a rare home loss, 107-97, on Monday night. After a blowout loss to Minnesota on Sunday, Lakers coach Luke Walton called for the two to bring more passion and fire. The duo responded, helping Los Angeles rally from a double-digit halftime deficit. ""I put so much responsibility on them because that's what I believe they're capable of doing,"" Walton said. Ball and Ingram said they talked after the loss Sunday and agreed they needed to step up in the absence of LeBron James and veteran point guard Rajon Rondo. ""With the guys out, (we were) trying to take over and be the leaders of our team,"" Ingram said. The Lakers won for just the second time in seven games since James strained his groin on Christmas Day, and they swept the season series from the Mavericks 3-0. Dallas led 67-54 at halftime but had its worst-scoring half of the season with just 30 points after the break -- fewer than it scored in either of the first two quarters. The Mavs were 11-of-43 from the field in the second half and had 11 turnovers. Luka Doncic led the team with 27 points, and he had six of their 11 made field goals in the second half, including their only two 3-pointers. ""I think they played way better defensively in the second half,"" Doncic said. ""We didn't move the ball as well as we did in the first half. That was it."" Ball was held scoreless against Minnesota but responded with some clutch baskets in the second half. His fast-break dunk gave the Lakers their first lead of the game at 82-80 late in the third quarter. And he hit his only 3 of the second half with 4:23 to go to give LA a 100-89 lead. ""I just tried to be more aggressive,"" Ball said. ""I shoot when I'm open. I just tried to force the issue a little bit more."" Ingram scored 15 of his 29 in the second half and had six assists for the game. With Dallas cutting a 14-point Lakers lead to seven twice in the final minutes, each time Ingram drew the defense to him and dished to JaVale McGee for dunks. Dallas fell for just the fourth time at home this season. The Mavericks entered the day tied for the fewest home losses in the NBA. TIP-INS Lakers: Josh Hart scored 14 points, led the team with 12 rebounds and five steals and tied Ingram for a team-high six assists. Mavericks: J.J. Barea played his 800th game, becoming the 11th undrafted player from a U.S. high school or college to play 800 games since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. ... Numerous Dallas Cowboys, including running back Ezekiel Elliott and linebacker Jaylon Smith, attended the game, drawing an ovation from the sellout crowd. KUZMA RETURNS With James still out, the Lakers got Kyle Kuzma back in the lineup after missing the past two games with a lower-back contusion. Kuzma missed his first eight shots and didn't score until midway through the second quarter, but he hit two 3s early in the third quarter to spark the Lakers' comeback. He finished with 13 points. OUT OF THE FLOW Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said a lack of ball movement has slowed the team in its losses this season, and on Monday, they had only 12 assists for a team that averages almost 23 a game. Barea could only laugh when told he led the team with three assists, saying, ""You can't win the game like that. Hopefully it won't happen again.""","401071272"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  It really hasn't been any easier for Jusuf Nurkic for the past half-dozen games, even if it appears that way. Nurkic had 20 points for his fourth straight game with 20 or more and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the New York Knicks 111-101 on Monday night. The 7-foot Bosnian center has been on a roll lately, averaging 21 points and 11.8 rebounds in the last six games for Portland. ""I work hard for that,"" Nurkic said when asked about his recent success. ""I got in foul trouble tonight, but I keep myself in the game. We won, so it's good."" Damian Lillard added 17 points and nine assists for Portland, which has won four of five. CJ McCollum also had 17 points. Enes Kanter came off the bench with 18 points and 14 rebounds for his third straight double-double for the Knicks, who have lost nine of 10. The teams played a lackluster first half, but Portland pulled away in the third quarter, stretching the lead to 18 points at one point. ""Their big guy (Nurkic) is a beast. He's huge. He is a mountain man. You can't move him and the guy is so nimble. He's never really off balance. He sees the floor well and finishes great around the rim with his touch,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""He's just a really difficult cover and he's just a mountain of a screener so when those guys coming running off of him and he gets contact on you it's just really hard to get around to that screen and they've built some great chemistry together."" Blazer coach Terry Stotts echoed Fizdale's praise, saying it's likely one of the best stretches that Nurkic has had in Portland. Stotts pointed to the rapport he's developed with Lillard on pick and rolls. ""He's slowed his game down to where he's making good reads in those situations,"" Stotts said. ""He's not turning the ball over as much. He's finishing in the paint. He's making his free throws. And that's not to mention what he's been giving us on the defensive end."" The Blazers led 54-53 at halftime. The top scorer at the break was Mario Hezonja, who had 12 points off the bench for the Knicks. Jake Layman started for Portland in the second half and the team announced that Maurice Harkless wouldn't return because of left knee soreness. Harkless, who had surgery on the knee in March, left without speaking to reporters after the game. The Blazers started to pull away in the third quarter, jumping to a 65-55 lead. But they were stung when Nurkic collected his fourth foul and had to head for the bench with 6:14 left in the period. Still, Portland had the momentum and went up 80-67 after Lillard's 3-pointer. Nurkic finished with eight rebounds, shy of his 21st double-double of the season. ""I always feel confident, even before,"" Nurkic said. ""But you never know, sometimes shots are going to go in, sometimes then go out."" INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS There was drama earlier in the day when former NBA player Hedo Turkoglu posted a statement to Twitter challenging Kanter's concerns about safety for a game in London on Jan. 17. Kanter, who is Turkish, has said he won't go because he fears retribution for his criticism of the leadership in his native country. Turkoglu, an adviser to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, suggested the reason Kanter could not travel was because he did not have the proper documents, accusing him of a ""political smear campaign."" In response, Kanter posted his travel documents and wrote: ""I CAN go to London. Either you are delusional, or still Erdogan's lap dog."" TIP INS Knicks: The Knicks were coming off a 119-112 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, which snapped an eight-game losing streak. ... Courtney Lee hasn't played for the last three games. Lee told the New York Daily News he understands the Knicks are focusing on the younger players. The Knicks have been looking to trade Lee. Trail Blazers: The Blazers improved to 24-17 at the official halfway point of the season. It is their best record at this point since the 2014-15 season when they were 30-11. ... Layman had 10 points and a career-high 10 rebounds. It was the first double-double of his career. QUOTABLE: ""I like the fact that we've had a little bit of ups and downs already. We've experienced some adversity early in the season and we got through it. We got to the midway point feeling good about ourselves."" -- Damian Lillard.","401071273"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  After four excruciating losses, the Sacramento Kings savored a rare blowout victory Monday night. De'Aaron Fox had 20 points and the Kings snapped a four-game skid with a 111-95 win over the Orlando Magic. Getting a little swagger back after blowing fourth-quarter leads in all four of those defeats, the Kings went ahead by double digits in a dominant second period and led by 28 entering the fourth. ""We've given a few games away, so it's good to come out and control the whole way,"" Fox said. ""It's great to have a game like this."" Playing in their somewhat frenetic offensive style, the Kings were running at every opportunity, especially early when they established the tempo. They outscored the Magic 24-12 in fast-break points and were even more dominant in the paint, owning a 64-24 edge. ""The ball was moving and everyone was sharing it,"" said Buddy Hield, who had 13 points. ""The ball has been really moving lately, even in the games we lost. When we are moving the ball well it's really hard to stop us."" Bogdan Bogdanovic had 15 points and seven assists for the Kings, and his 32 minutes marked the most by any starter. Willie Cauley-Stein added 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Justin Jackson also had 11 points. Terrence Ross hit five 3-pointers and scored 20 points and Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Orlando, which has dropped three straight and eight of 11. Evan Fournier hit four 3s and scored 15 points. ""It's a tough situation for us and it's disappointing the way we've been playing,"" Vucevic said. ""We have to keep working and find a way to turn things around."" The speedy Fox shot 9 of 14 and directed the Kings' offense with precision, committing only one of Sacramento's nine turnovers. He exited late in the third quarter and never returned, playing 22 minutes. An Orlando turnover led to an acrobatic fast-break dunk by Fox, putting the Kings ahead by 25 late in the third quarter. They led 90-62 after three. Behind a strong effort from their bench, the Kings opened the second quarter on a 20-2 run. Fox had 11 points, helping Sacramento take a 58-42 lead into halftime. Orlando shot under 37 percent, committed 16 turnovers and was outscored 29-17 in the decisive second quarter. ""We just struggled to score. We have to find a way to where we have enough shooting on the floor all the time to create spacing. It's a problem,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""There's not a lot of room with some of the lineups out there for anybody to have a place to go. It makes it hard."" BAGLEY IS BACK After missing 11 games with a knee injury, Sacramento rookie Marvin Bagley III had eight points and six rebounds in 20 minutes. Prior to the injury, Bagley had stepped up his play and was a key figure off the bench. He entered averaging 12.7 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. ""(The knee) feels great. After a couple of times down the court I got a little tired,"" Bagley said. ""But as the game went on I felt a lot like I did before I was hurt. It will take some time, a game or two to get back in the flow of things."" TIP-INS Magic: Shot a dismal 12 of 39 (31 percent) in the opening half. ... Vucevic had his 27th double-double this season. ... Aaron Gordon shot 3 of 13 and had 10 points. Kings: Had a 13-27 record last year after 40 games. This season, Sacramento is 20-20. ... Starting guard Iman Shumpert missed his second straight game with an injured right index finger. ... The bench produced 48 points.","401071274"
"CLEVELAND --  The Indiana Pacers found plenty to be displeased about after a victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Pacers were upset that they had to make several plays in the closing minutes to hold off Cleveland 123-115 and send the Cavaliers to their 10th straight loss. Indiana led 38-14 late in the first quarter and was ahead by 23 points in the third against the team with the worst record in the league. But the game got close down the stretch. ""We've got to be better than that -- and we know it,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""We got off to a really good start, then in the second half, we played the scoreboard."" Thaddeus Young scored 26 points and Bojan Bogdanovic had 23. The Pacers needed baskets by Young and Victor Oladipo, who had 17 points, to close out the win. Cleveland (8-33) suffered another blow when forward Larry Nance Jr. hurt his right knee in the first quarter and didn't return. Nance will travel with the team to New Orleans, where the Cavs begin a six-game trip Wednesday, and be re-evaluated. Domantas Sabonis had 15 points for the Pacers, who have won seven of eight. Jordan Clarkson scored 26 points for Cleveland, which trailed 87-64 in the third quarter before cutting the lead to five several times in the fourth. Cleveland was within 115-110 with 1:24 to play, but Oladipo hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key and Young scored on a layup. ""We played a good first 24 minutes, but the second 24 minutes were horrible,"" Young said. Clarkson scored 10 points in the final four minutes and the Cavaliers trailed 92-79 going into the fourth. The Cavaliers had lost five straight home games by 20 or more points during their losing streak. ""It was a great effort in fighting back, but there are no moral victories at this stage,"" coach Larry Drew said. ""We have to be better."" Cleveland's last win came at Indiana on Dec. 18. The Pacers jumped ahead quickly. Indiana led by 10 points midway through the first quarter. Bogdanovic had 14 points and the Pacers made 16 of 22 shots in the quarter. Alec Burks scored 19 points for Cleveland. Tristan Thompson had 15 points and 13 rebounds while rookie point guard Collin Sexton scored 14. Nance appeared to get hurt when he was fouled while going up for a shot under the basket. He's averaging 9.1 points and 7.7 rebounds, and leads the team in assists, steals and blocked shots. Drew indicated over the weekend that he'd make lineup changes, but decided against that because of the team's long injury list. All-Star forward Kevin Love, who has played in only four games this season because of left foot surgery, said Monday that he's still weeks away from doing any significant on-court work. Cleveland's trip also includes games against Houston, the Los Angeles Lakers, Portland, Utah and Denver. NOT SO COOL McMillan was unhappy the Pacers allowed 36 points in each of the last two quarters. ""We got cool-breeze and almost dropped a game that we had complete control over,"" he said. 41 TO GO The Cavaliers reached the halfway point of a season that has seen coach Tyronn Lue get fired after an 0-6 start, injuries to key players and several veterans being traded. LOSER PAYS Sexton, who played one season at Alabama, lost a wager to teammate Jaron Blossomgame, a Clemson alum, over Monday night's national championship football game. Sexton had to wear a Clemson windbreaker on the team's flight to New Orleans to pay up for the Tigers' 44-16 rout of Alabama. Asked for a comment on the outcome, Sexton would only say, ""Roll Tide.""

"PHILADELPHIA --  Philadelphia rookie Landry Shamet was putting on such a stellar shooting display that Joel Embiid took a seat in the second row to watch it with the rest of the 76ers fans. Shamet made eight 3-pointers and scored 29 points, both career-highs, and Embiid had 20 points and 10 rebounds to lead the 76ers to a 132-115 rout of the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. ""He was hot,"" Embiid said. The Philadelphia big man put his hand to Shamet's forehead, as if to take his temperature, while on the court. With the 76ers up big in the second half, Embiid retreated to the second row and put a young 76ers fan on his lap to watch part of the show. ""It was amazing,"" Embiid said of his view. Jimmy Butler added 20 points and Ben Simmons had 19 points, nine assists and five rebounds for the 76ers, who won their fourth straight and for the seventh time in nine games. ""We're good right now,"" Simmons said. ""We're on the right track to where we want to be."" Bradley Beal scored 28 points for the Wizards. Philadelphia improved to an NBA-best 18-3 at home. Embiid, Simmons and Butler rested for most of the second half. Shamet took a leading role with sharpshooter JJ Redick (back) sidelined for the first time this season. ""He more than replaced JJ,"" Embiid said. Shamet, who entered averaging 7.7 points and 38.5 percent from the arc, said he didn't do anything differently. ""It felt like another game,"" he said. ""I came out shooing and these guys told me to keep shooting."" The 76ers trailed by as many as eight points early, but pulled away with a strong second quarter that continued their home dominance over Washington. The 76ers have defeated the Wizards in six straight in Philadelphia. The Sixers shot 57 percent from the field in the period while outscoring the Wizards by 20 points to take a 68-45 advantage at the break. Butler's alley-oop tip of T.J. McConnell's pass early in the second quarter was one of many first-half highlights for Philadelphia. ""We couldn't get any stops and we couldn't score,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said of the second quarter. ""We fell apart."" The halftime score was nearly identical to the first matchup between the teams this season when the 76ers had a 68-46 advantage on their way to a 123-98 home victory on Nov. 30. LET'S PLAY TWO The contest was the first game of a rare consecutive-day, home-and-home. The teams will meet Wednesday night in Washington, where the Wizards have won eight in a row over the 76ers. Philadelphia's last win in Washington came Nov. 1, 2013. BUTLER'S BACK Butler returned after missing the last two games with an upper respiratory infection. And the four-time All-Star was back on the court for the first time since a report said that Butler was displeased with how he's being used in Brett Brown's offense and let the coach know in a film session exchange that was reportedly ""disrespectful."" Brown and Butler denied the report. Brown acknowledged that he is working on making some subtle changes to the offense to accommodate Butler. And Butler was on target Tuesday night, making his first six shots before finishing 8 for 9 from the field. TIP-INS Washington: The Wizards' last win in Philadelphia came on March 17, 2016. . Washington played its sixth game without John Wall (heel surgery), falling to 3-3. . The Wizards dropped to 5-18 on the road.

"MIAMI --  Nikola Jokic's numbers were big, as usual. And his shooting touch at the end was perfectly soft. Jokic had his fourth triple-double of the season -- 29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists -- and his high-arching shot in the lane with 2.4 seconds left lifted the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets to a 103-99 win over the Miami Heat on Tuesday night. ""That's my kind of shot,"" said Jokic, who now has 20 career triple-doubles. ""I love floaters, all kind of floaters."" Jamal Murray had 18 points, Trey Lyles added 15, Paul Millsap had 12 and Torrey Craig finished with 11 points and 16 rebounds for the Nuggets, who outrebounded Miami 50-38 and had a 23-11 edge in second-chance points. It came on the second night of a back-to-back that started Monday in Houston, and without Gary Harris -- sidelined with left hamstring tightness. ""Hell of a win,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""I don't know if it's a statement win or not. But it's a win where we had every reason to use an excuse for the loss. And we don't want to be a team that makes excuses. We want to be a team that finds ways when everything is stacked against us."" Dion Waiters returned to the lineup and scored 15 points for Miami, which got 13 apiece from Bam Adebayo and Kelly Olynyk, and 12 each from Hassan Whiteside, Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow. It was Waiters' first time playing in Miami since December 2017. He missed more than a year after ankle surgery. ""A healthy me, that's all I can ask for,"" Waiters said. ""I can just go out there and play. I don't have to worry about anything."" A back-and-forth fourth quarter saw the Heat get down by six, then take a six-point lead after a 12-0 run, and rally from four points down to tie it in the last 2 minutes -- with Adebayo getting both of those baskets, the second one coming with 22.9 seconds left. That's when Denver went to Jokic, who took a bounce pass from Murray and dropped in what became the biggest shot of the night. Miami's chance to tie went awry when Olynyk's lob for Richardson on the inbounds attempt sailed out of bounds -- just the sixth Heat turnover, yet the most costly one. ""We did enough things to put ourselves in a position to win,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""They just made more plays down the stretch. Simple as that."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Harris went through some efforts to get loose before the game, but was ruled out about an hour before tip-off. Malik Beasley started in his place. ... Isaiah Thomas (right hip surgery) went through a shooting session before the game. He hasn't played yet this season, but got to exchange jerseys with Heat star Dwyane Wade postgame.

Miami announced another sellout crowd, which means Thursday's game against Boston could be the team's 400th consecutive sellout at home. ... The Heat were only 15 for 25 from the foul line.

Haslem said in September that he is retiring, and hasn't wavered much since. ""There's a huge life outside of basketball that I've been preparing for and that's been waiting for me,"" Haslem said. The Heat still value his leadership, and may want him back next season.

"TORONTO --  Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry shared the court for the first time in almost a month for Toronto, yet it was Serge Ibaka who scored the biggest basket of the game for the Raptors Ibaka scored the winning points on a dunk with 17 seconds remaining and the Raptors won their sixth straight home game, 104-101 over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night. ""We pulled one out,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""We were trying to get away from them and never really could."" Leonard scored 31 points, Pascal Siakam had 13 points and 10 rebounds, and Lowry scored 16 points as the Raptors earned their sixth consecutive win over the Hawks. OG Anunoby scored 14 points and Ibaka had 13. Lowry and Leonard played together for the first time since a Dec. 9 home loss to Milwaukee. Toronto has not lost at home since. Lowry had missed 10 of the past 14 games because of hip and back injuries, returning Sunday against Indiana. Leonard missed that game to rest. Toronto is 16-6 when Lowry and Leonard both play. John Collins had 21 points and 14 rebounds, Jeremy Lin scored 20 points and Trae Young added 19 for the Hawks, who have lost four of five. Atlanta made a season-worst 27 turnovers, leading to 34 Toronto points. ""If we keep it under 20, the result is a little different,"" Atlanta's Vince Carter said. Neither team led by more than five in a tight fourth quarter. Atlanta's Dewayne Dedmon made a pair of foul shots at 2:15 to put the Hawks up 101-98, but Toronto finished the game with a 6-0 run. Anonuboy's layup with 1:57 remaining cut the gap to one and, after a steal by Leonard, Ibaka's dunk with 17 seconds to go put Toronto up 102-101. Following a timeout, Young drove against Leonard but missed his shot. Ibaka grabbed the rebound that led to a fast break dunk for Anunoby with less than a second to go. ""You had a rookie going up against probably the best defensive player in the league,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""He just kind of fell for the bait."" Carter, a former star with the Raptors, launched a long 3-point try at the buzzer but came up empty. ""Tip your hats to the Hawks,"" Lowry said. ""Those guys, they're playing extremely hard."" The banged-up Hawks were without guard Kevin Huerter (back). Guard Kent Bazemore missed his fifth straight game because of a sprained right ankle, while center Miles Plumlee sat for the third straight game because of a sore left ankle. Forward Taurean Prince has not played since Dec. 3 because of a sprained left ankle. ""I'm personally not a big fan of the moral victories, but with a lot of guys down, guys stepped up and played hard,"" Carter said. A former slam dunk champion whose career began in Toronto, Carter received a brief standing ovation when he checked in for the first time at 5:13 of the first quarter. He scored six points in 13 minutes. ""The joy of stepping into this arena each and every year is something I always look forward to,"" Carter said. Making his first start of the season in place of Huerter, Lin made all four of his shots and scored 10 points in the first as Atlanta led 31-28 after one. After shooting 0 for 6 from 3-point range in the first, the Raptors shot 6 for 10 from long range in the second. Atlanta led 57-56 at halftime. Leonard and Lowry each scored eight points in the third and Toronto took an 80-77 lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta scored 12 points off six Toronto turnovers in the first quarter. ...

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Ryan Saunders went right into the fire in his first game as the Minnesota Timberwolves' interim coach. His debut was a down-to-the wire finish with the Oklahoma City Thunder, one of the best teams in the Western Conference. His team came through. Andrew Wiggins had a season-high 40 points and 10 rebounds, and the Timberwolves beat the Thunder 119-117 on Tuesday night. Saunders deflected credit after the game. ""It's unbelievable how they stayed connected throughout the whole game,"" he said. ""Down the stretch, there were so many times where we could have disbanded and then the crowd could have got into us. I can't say enough about that team.""

Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook missed two 3-pointers in the closing seconds that would have given the Thunder the lead. He finished with 25 points and 16 assists. ""We just tried to stay solid, really,"" Wiggins said. ""We knew they were going to try to be aggressive with either (Paul) George or Westbrook. If we're going to foul, make a hard foul. And don't let them hit the 3. That was the main thing."" George scored 27 points and Steven Adams added 20 points and 12 rebounds for Oklahoma City. Thunder reserve center Nerlens Noel was taken off the court on a stretcher in the third quarter after Wiggins made contact with him on a dunk attempt. Noel took an elbow in the face as Wiggins went up, and Noel hit the ground hard. A defensive foul was called on Noel. The play was reviewed, and no additional fouls were called. Noel was down for several minutes before being taken from the court. Thunder coach Billy Donovan said Noel was taken to the University of Oklahoma's OU Medical Center. ""I just tried to make an aggressive move and dunk,"" Wiggins said. ""He tried to contest it. I think he fell wrong. I didn't really see it until I saw him on the ground. Hopefully, he's good. I hope nothing but the best for him. I hope he gets healthy soon and comes back stronger."" In the fourth quarter, Oklahoma City guard Dennis Schroder somehow won a jump ball with Towns, and Westbrook hit a 3-pointer to give the Thunder a 111-110 lead. Josh Okogie's corner 3-pointer with 26.8 seconds left put the Timberwolves up 119-115. Westbrook made two free throws, then Minnesota's Tyus Jones traveled with 15.5 seconds left to give the Thunder a chance. TIP-INS Thunder: G Alex Abrines missed his fifth consecutive game for personal reasons. ... Schroder was listed as questionable with a left quad contusion, but he entered the game in the first quarter. ... Westbrook fell one assist short of his season high. Timberwolves: G Derrick Rose missed his sixth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... F Robert Covington missed his fourth straight game with a bruised right knee. ...

"PHOENIX --  Three weeks after coming to the Phoenix Suns, Kelly Oubre Jr. says he's starting to feel comfortable. He sure looked that way against Sacramento on Tuesday night. Oubre matched his career high with 26 points, including a one-handed rebound jam with 11.1 seconds to play, and the Suns snapped a six-game losing streak, rallying from a 21-point deficit to beat the turnover-prone Kings 115-111. The energetic, athletic Oubre, obtained in the trade that sent Trevor Ariza to Washington on Dec. 17, equaled the 26 points he scored for the Wizards against Detroit on Jan. 19 of last year. ""Being decisive, I think that was the big thing for me tonight,"" he said. ""Finally just getting more comfortable out there, finding my spots on the floor, finding ways to impact the game in this new system."" T.J. Warren added 21 points and Deandre Ayton had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Suns, who were without leading scorer Devin Booker due to back spasms. De'Aaron Fox scored 24 and Ben McLemore 20 for the Kings, who committed a season-high 26 turnovers, 17 in the second half. Sacramento lost for the fifth time in six games. ""A lot of mistakes, a lot of turnovers,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We were very casual coming out of halftime. We turned it over too much in the first half and certainly turned it over way too much in the second half."" Fox committed eight turnovers -- seven in the second half. ""It was just turnovers,"" he said. ""We gave up the ball too much and it's what cost us the game. The times that we didn't turn the ball over we got what we wanted, but when you 20-some turnovers, you can't win like that."" After six losses, Phoenix salvaged the finale of a seven-game homestand. Phoenix finished the game on an 11-2 run after Fox's 3-pointer put Sacramento up 109-104 with 2:23 to play. De'Anthony Melton's rebound basket gave the Suns a 110-109 lead, but Willie Cauley-Stein's two-handed dunk put Sacramento back up 111-110. Oubre's two free throws restored the lead to Phoenix, 112-111, and after yet another Sacramento turnover, Oubre slammed Warren's miss home to make it 114-111. ""Yeah man, that was the dagger,"" Oubre said. Ayton sealed it by making one of two free throws with 7.2 seconds to go. Phoenix led 35-32 after one quarter but the Kings used an 8-0 run to lead 55-45 on Justin Jackson's 3-pointer with 5:50 left in the half. The Kings had another 8-0 run to finish the half, capped by McLemore's 3, to lead 72- 53 at the break. Sacramento led by as many as 21 early in the second half before Warren scored the first five in a 7-0 Phoenix spurt to cut the lead to 77-65. The Suns outscored Sacramento 13-2 over the last four minutes of the third quarter to tie it 86-86 entering the fourth. The scoring run reached 16-2 when Jamal Crawford sank a 3-pointer after a Suns offensive rebound in the opening minute of the final quarter. TIP INS Kings: Kings were given the NBA Inclusion Innovation Award on Tuesday for efforts to support youth and community healing following the death of Stephon Clark, who was shot by police during a pursuit on foot last March. ... Last time they met the Suns, on Dec. 8, Kings led 36-9 after one quarter. .... Kings committed 11 turnovers in the third quarter to aid the Suns' comeback.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Steve Kerr reminded his Warriors that with everything they have gone through already, Golden State reached the season's halfway point with 27 wins -- so right on pace for 54. Klay Thompson is aiming higher. ""Who cares? We know how to play good basketball,"" said Kevin Durant, who is most concerned with how prepared the Warriors are for playoff time. Now, a major reinforcement looks to be joining the effort by month's end: a healthy DeMarcus Cousins, one of the NBA's best big men when at full strength. Thompson scored 43 points with seven 3-pointers, Stephen Curry had his first double-double of the season with 14 points and a season-best 14 assists, and the Golden State Warriors snapped a rare three-game home losing streak by beating the cold-shooting New York Knicks 122-95 on Tuesday night. Cousins said after the game he is targeting a game Jan. 18 at the Clippers for his return from left Achilles tendon surgery, his long-anticipated Warriors debut. ""We obviously want him coming back into a good vibe. That would be nice,"" Curry said, ""and us feeling good about ourselves with a guy like DeMarcus Cousins back in the lineup, so that'll be fun."" Durant added 24 points, six rebounds and six assists while Draymond Green had 11 rebounds and 10 of his team's 36 assists as the Warriors pulled away late in the first half to get back on a winning track at Oracle Arena. Thompson hit 5 of his first 7 shots and had 12 points by the end of the first, finishing 18 of 29 from the floor -- 7 for 16 from long range -- and notching his second game with at least 40 points after going off for 52 at Chicago on Oct. 29. Mario Hezonja scored 19 points for the Knicks, who shot 39.8 percent (35 of 88). Enes Kanter added 12 points and 16 rebounds. ""We grew some thick skin over this,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. ""We took some lumps from some good teams."" The Warriors ended the first half on a 13-0 run over the final 2:47 of the first half to turn a 49-48 deficit into a 61-49 lead at the break. The skid at home matched the longest at Oracle Arena during Kerr's five seasons as coach. Curry chuckled recalling Thompson walking off the court offering, ""When's the last time we blew somebody out, 2016?"" Golden State won its 10th straight against New York and fifth in a row at home, and this marked the Knicks' final visit to Oracle Arena before the two-time defending champion Warriors move across the bay to new arena Chase Center starting next season. Curry began 3 for 10 and finished just 5 of 19, 3 for 12 from deep, while Durant started 3 of 9 and missed his initial five 3-point tries. Curry hit 10 3-pointers on the way to 42 points in Saturday's 127-123 win at Sacramento, moving him into fourth place on the all-time 3-point list. He had three more Tuesday to reach 2,280, two shy of matching Jason Terry (2,282) for third all-time. COUSINS' PROGRESS All-Star center Cousins' progress has been encouraging in recent scrimmages enough that Kerr expects him back soon -- perhaps even sooner than Jan. 18. Cousins, who could give the Warriors five All-Star starters, has made strides in recent weeks with his conditioning. ""I think it'll happen around that time. It's not as simple as that's the game. It's somewhere in that neighborhood,"" he said. ""... The last two scrimmages that he's had it's looked to us and it's felt ot him that he has broken through a barrier, and we were waiting for that barrier."" Before the game, Kerr said the Warriors were planning for Cousins. ""We have a decent idea how we'd like to use DeMarcus and in what rotations,"" he said. ""It might not be as simple as `This looks good on paper."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York shot 6 of 24 on 3s and was outrebounded 49-39. ... The Knicks haven't beaten the Warriors since an 89-84 victory on March 30, 2014, also the last time New York won at Oracle Arena. New York lost 15 of its last 17 overall in Oakland. ... G Frank Ntilikina missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle, while C Mitchell Robinson sat out his 11th consecutive contest with a sprained left ankle. Warriors: Thompson had his 12th career 40-point game. ... Durant's two blocks gave him 900 for his career. He also scored 20 or more points in his 14th straight game. ... Shaun Livingston, who needs one game for 800 in his career, sat out with soreness in his left knee. ... Golden State won 128-100 at New York on Oct. 26 and swept the two regular-season games with the Knicks for a fifth straight season.

"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers are showing signs of regaining their November form when they won 11 of 14 games. Lou Williams had 27 points and 10 assists, and the Clippers beat the Charlotte Hornets 128-109 for the ninth straight time at Staples Center on Tuesday night. Montrezl Harrell added 23 points and 11 rebounds, Tobias Harris had 23 and Danilo Gallinari 20 in the Clippers' third win in a row overall. Harrell even busted out a turnaround fadeaway, a shot he's not known for. ""I wait until the defense takes something away and I counter,"" he said. The Hornets got within two early in the third before the Clippers took control for good. They closed the period on a 17-9 run, led by Harrell's eight straight points, to take an 86-77 lead into the fourth. ""Once we picked our pressure up, we got more focused on that end and that was big,"" Harris said. Los Angeles stretched its lead to 20 points in a 42-point fourth on Williams' basket after Gallinari's 3-pointer. Avery Bradley and Williams hit back-to-back 3-pointers that extended the lead to 121-98. ""We got really good efforts from everybody,"" Harris said. ""We're pretty close to getting back."" Malik Monk scored 19 of his 24 points in the fourth for the Hornets, who fell to 5-13 on the road with their fourth loss in six games. ""They made very few mistakes. They rarely turned the ball over,"" Monk said. ""We were rushing and out of our own rhythm. They forced us out of our rhythm and they outworked us."" Kemba Walker, who leads the league in fourth-quarter points at 8.6, didn't score in the period. He finished with 13. ""We trapped all night. He warrants that,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""It was just try to coral him."" Charlotte's only lead was four points in the game's opening minutes. TIP-INS Hornets: Their last win at Staples Center against the Clippers was on Feb. 28, 2009. ... F-C Cody Zeller (right hand surgery) is still 4-to-6 weeks away from returning. ... G Jeremy Lamb returned to start after missing three straight games with a right hamstring strain. He had 16 points.

Rivers couldn't adjust to seeing Parker in a uniform other than that of the San Antonio Spurs, where he played for 18 seasons. ""It's just strange,"" Rivers said. ""Looking at Tony Parker in another uniform is outright wrong.""","401071282"
"BOSTON --  There's no secret to the Boston Celtics recent roll. The Celtics continued to share the offensive load, and the results showed again in a 135-113 rout of the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night for their fourth straight win. ""It's not too often that we're going to put up 135 points, but I feel like consistently over the last few games, we've done a great job of making shots,"" said Kyrie Irving, who had 12 points in 24 minutes before getting to rest the entire fourth quarter. ""We're making shots. We're continuing to make each other better and make those plays that we weren't making at the beginning of the season."" The Celtics had 32 assists -- their fifth straight game with 30 or more -- and put together their highest scoring game this season. Boston (25-15) also ended a three-game skid against the Pacers, who entered the night third in the Eastern Conference having won seven of eight. ""It just looked like we were gassed tonight,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We knew they could come out fast and they did. They came out very aggressive, attacking us and just we weren't able to establish anything defensively against this group."" Marcus Morris had 22 points and eight rebounds, Jaylen Brown also scored 22 points and Jayson Tatum had 20 for the Celtics, who have won five of six. Gordon Hayward had 14 points, Daniel Theis added 12 points and six rebounds off the bench, and Terry Rozier had 12 points and five assists. Domantas Sabonis had 20 points and seven rebounds for the Pacers (27-14), who had won seven of eight. Thaddeus Young had 10 points and eight rebounds, and Victor Oladipo scored 17 points. The Pacers never led and fell to 5-2 in the second of back-to-back games this season. They wilted in the second half after beating Cleveland 123-115 the previous night. ""They just beat us in every category today,"" Oladipo said. ""Everything you can imagine, they beat us in."" Boston led 68-53 at halftime after shooting 56.5 percent (26 for 46) in the first half. Indiana used a 10-2 run early in the third and cut the margin to 79-67 on Sabonis' hook shot with 5:31 left in the period, but Boston took off again and topped 100 points before the quarter was over. Theis converted a three-point play to start the Celtics on a 12-3 run, and Boston closed out the period with another surge, getting back-to-back 3-pointers by Rozier for a 100-74 lead with 1:27 left. KEEP SHARING The Celtics' string of 30-plus assist games is their longest since a six-game run in March and April of 1987. ""We're all understanding that we're trying to play faster and the ball movement has been working for us,"" said Al Horford, who led Boston with eight assists. ""It keeps the defense on their toes, really makes the other team work. It's kind of contagious."" OUT-PACED Boston's point total was also the most allowed by Indiana this season -- eight more points than Charlotte scored on the Pacers on Nov. 27. ""The fourth game of a five-game road trip and you're playing Boston on a back-to-back,"" McMillan said. ""In a situation like that, you knew they were going to try to be aggressive, run us out of the building right from the start. And we just never could keep up with them.""

"WASHINGTON --  After rising off the floor midway through the fourth quarter, Bradley Beal flashed a thankful smile. Washington's leading scorer had survived the full force of Joel Embiid. Beal drew the charge from Philadelphia's brawny center, then went on to score 14 consecutive points and finish with 34, helping the Wizards beat the 76ers 123-106 on Wednesday night for a split of the home-and-home set. ""I don't mind taking charges -- I'm a physical player,"" Beal said. ""But with Jojo, it's a little different story. He's a big fella. I'm glad I got a lift in yesterday."" Otto Porter Jr. added 23 points, his most since returning from a quadriceps injury this month, and Trevor Ariza had 17 to help Washington improve to 4-3 since losing All-Star guard John Wall for the season. Embiid had 35 points and 14 rebounds for the 76ers. They committed 23 turnovers, and had a four-game winning streak end. Jimmy Butler added 23 points, and Ben Simmons had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Philadelphia. A night after hitting more than half of their 31 attempts from beyond the arc, the 76ers shot 8 of 27 from 3-point range, going 3 of 20 in the first three quarters. ""The combination of not being able to make some shots, the turnovers creating a lot of their offensive looks was too hard to overcome,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. Philadelphia cut what had been a 26-point deficit in the third quarter down to 12 in the fourth on the possession that followed Embiid's charge. Beal answered by individually outscoring the visitors 14-5 to make it 116-95 with 4:22 left. He shot 6 of 11 from 3-point range and 13 of 21 overall from the field. Not to mention a gutsy defensive play. ""He's willing to do whatever it takes to win,"" Ariza said. ""We all see that in him."" NOT OTTO SHAPE Porter continued in his current role off the bench, but played 33 minutes in his fifth game since returning from his 10-game injury layoff. That was his most action since Dec. 5, though he insisted his return is still a work in progress. ""There is nothing easy about getting back,"" he said. ""Just getting back in game shape, that is the biggest (thing), getting my second wind."" TAKE IT BACK! Philadelphia has lost six of its eight games in the second game of back-to-back sets. Against Washington, however, Simmons didn't believe the timing of the game mattered. ""I think that was just lack of competitiveness,"" Simmons said. ""I don't think we competed."" WHOSE HOUSE? A sizable contingent of 76ers fans made their presence known. That included booing the Wizards' player introductions and chanting ""E-A-G-L-E-S! EAGLES!"" TECHNICALLY SPEAKING Washington picked up two technical fouls during a 32-second stretch early in the third. Thomas Bryant received his for hanging on the rim too long following a dunk, and Jeff Green got the second for arguing. Brown also picked up a tech for arguing a call in the second quarter. TIP-INS 76ers: J.J. Redick (back) sat out a second consecutive game, but Brown doesn't expect his absence to last long. ""We're in sort of hyper-sensitive mode with J.J,"" Brown said about his most productive 3-point shooter. ""He's that important."" Wizards: Led 25-20 after the first quarter despite committing seven turnovers. ... Porter Jr. played with a sore right hand after injuring it Tuesday night in Philadelphia.","401071284"
"NEW YORK --  The Nets already showed they can fight their way out of tough times, having left an eight-game skid behind last month. So a 19-point deficit certainly wasn't going to deter them. D'Angelo Russell scored 23 points, Ed Davis grabbed a season-high 16 rebounds, and the Nets climbed out of their early hole to beat the Atlanta Hawks 116-100 on Wednesday night. DeMarre Carroll added 17 points to help the Nets improve to 21-22 with their eighth victory in their last nine home games. They managed only 20 wins for the entire season just two years ago, but have engineered a big turnaround after a slow start to this season. On Wednesday, they did the same thing in the game. ""I don't think in the beginning of the year we would have finished the game out like we did. But now we've grown,"" center Jarrett Allen said. They yielded 46 points in the first 15 minutes, then held the Hawks to 37 points over the next 25 minutes. Joe Harris, back after a one-game absence with a sprained right ankle, scored 16 points, as did Spencer Dinwiddie. John Collins had 30 points and 14 rebounds for the Hawks, who may have run out of steam after their strong start while playing a night after a close loss in Toronto. Trae Young had 17 points and seven assists, and Jeremy Lin added 16 points. ""I think we came out with the momentum from last night's game,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""A lot of energy, a lot of movement, a lot of pace, attacking downhill and then we just ran out of gas."" The Hawks jumped to a 13-4 lead behind two three-point plays from Collins, who scored 12 points in the first quarter to help Atlanta open a 38-23 lead. The Hawks extended the lead to 46-27 on Young's three-point play after his steal about three minutes into the second, but the Hawks stalled from there and Brooklyn got it down to 57-51 at halftime. The Nets then got the first basket of the second half and Hawks called timeout just 18 seconds in. Harris knocked down three 3-pointers over the next few minutes as the Nets moved ahead after trailing the entire first half, and they gained control for good by scoring the last nine of the third quarter, capped by Davis' three-point play, to bring an 86-80 edge to the fourth. ""Guys just vocalized that we needed to pick up the energy, just compete harder,"" Harris said. ""That's all it really boiled down to. It had nothing to do with Xs and Os, making shots, anything like that. It was just competing harder and we did a better job to help us in the defensive end in the second quarter."" TIP-INS Hawks: There was a video tribute for Vince Carter during a first-quarter timeout. Carter is third on the Nets' career scoring list. He had three points. ... Collins had his 11th 20-point, 10-rebound game. Nets: Starting F Jared Dudley left in the third quarter with an injured left hamstring. He lost the ball while driving to the basket, raised his hand to check out of the game and walked directly to the nearby tunnel toward the locker room. ... The Nets have beat the Hawks four straight times, matching a franchise record. GOOD TIMES, BUT IS IT GOOD-BYE? Carter enjoyed watching the video of his highlights of his 4 1/2 seasons as a Net. He turns 42 this month and is in his 21st season, but hasn't said if he will retire. Still, he didn't mind that the video may have been premature. ""I'm OK with it. Either way it's cool,"" he said with a smile. ""I'm very thankful for it, that they even considered it."" TOUGH TIMES DON'T LAST It was about a month ago that the Nets had dropped eight straight games to fall to 8-18. They then knocked off Toronto on Dec. 7 to start a seven-game winning streak. Coach Kenny Atkinson said that while losing so much feels like an ""apocalypse,"" he leaned on his days as a Hawks assistant to Mike Budenholzer. ""I always reference the Atlanta days, when we lost 15 out of 16,"" he said of the 2013-14 season, when the Hawks actually lost 14 of 15. ""Who knew the next year we were going to win 60 games or whatever? So with Coach Bud, whether it was during that losing streak or during the winning streak, we kind of conducted business as usual and stuck with our kind of beliefs and our culture.""","401071285"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo says playing reigning MVP James Harden was ""just another game"" and is solely focused on adding to the Bucks' win column. (0:45) HOUSTON --  Giannis Antetokounmpo wasn't going to join in on the debate about whether he should be an early favorite for MVP after he led the Milwaukee Bucks to a victory over the Houston Rockets and last year's MVP James Harden on Wednesday night. The rising young star was just happy his team was leaving Houston with a win. ""All I care about is winning,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I know by winning and doing whatever it takes to help your teammates and leaving everything out on the floor everything will take care of itself, the titles and all that."" Antetokounmpo scored 27 points and grabbed a season-high 21 rebounds to help the Bucks withstand a 42-point performance from Harden in a 116-109 win. In this matchup of early front-runners for MVP, Harden and his teammates were done in by a shooting slump late in the third quarter that spilled into the fourth and left them down by 15 points. ""We just got stagnant and defensively I think we allowed 38 points in that quarter -- way too many -- especially at home and so there you go,"" Harden said. ""We couldn't get out in transition. We couldn't get to where we want to go because we couldn't get any stops."" Milwaukee held a 13-point lead with about five minutes left before Houston used an 8-0 run, started by two 3-pointers from Harden, to cut the lead to 107-102. The Bucks got a layup from Eric Bledsoe before Harden scored the next four points to get Houston within 109-106 with 2 1/2 minutes left. Antetokounmpo made one of two free throws to push Milwaukee's lead to four points with about 90 seconds left. Harden missed his third straight 3-pointer before Antetokounmpo added a layup on the other end to make it 112-106 with 40 seconds remaining. Harden missed another 3 seconds later and the Bucks added four free throws down the stretch to secure the their seventh victory in eight games. It was Harden's sixth 40-point outing in the last eight games and he has scored 30 or more points in 14 straight games, which is the longest streak since Tracy McGrady did it in 2003. He shot 6 of 16 on 3-pointers to give him at least five in the last 11 games. Houston center Clint Capela struggled, making just 4 of 16 shots a game after scoring a career-high 31 points in a win over the Nuggets on Monday. He finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Coach Mike D'Antoni credited Milwaukee's big defensive duo of Brook Lopez and Antetokounmpo for making things tough on Capela. ""They're imposing at the rim,"" D'Antoni said. ""They did a good job and it costs us some turnovers, and we just weren't real sharp and we tried to force some things up underneath the basket."" The Bucks scored the first six points of the fourth quarter to stretch a run they started in the third quarter to 15-0 and make it 98-83 with about 10 minutes left. The Rockets got their first field goal since the 4:32 mark of the third quarter when P.J. Tucker made a 3-pointer a few seconds after that. Houston led by 6 at halftime after 23 points by Harden, but the Bucks opened the third quarter with an 11-3 run to take a 65-63 lead with about 9 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. Milwaukee got four points from Malcolm Brogdon and three from Antetokounmpo in that stretch. The Rockets got five quick points from Gerald Green to start a 7-0 run later in the third that put them up 75-70. The Bucks were down by 7 later in the quarter before using a 17-1 spurt to end the quarter and take a 92-83 lead into the fourth. That run included a 9-0 run in the last 1:19 of the quarter highlighted by a tip-in at the buzzer by Antetokounmpo. TIP-INS Bucks: D.J. Wilson missed his second straight game with a bruised hip. ... Brogdon finished with 24 points. ... Khris Middleton added 15 points. Rockets: Chris Paul missed his ninth game in a row with a strained left hamstring. ... Eric Gordon missed his fifth straight game with a bruised right knee. ... Houston shot 18 of 48 on 3-pointers. BOUNCE PASS? A weird play came in the third quarter when Antetokounmpo threw a pass across the lane and it bounced off Harden's face and back at Antetokounmpo , who dished it to Ersan Ilyasova for a 3. Harden fell slowly to the court after he was hit but got up quickly and seemed to be OK. Antetokounmpo felt bad that he hit Harden in the face and said he apologized. ""It was crazy because it was so hard for the ball to be able to bounce from one side of the floor to the other side of the floor that's how you know how hard the pass was,"" he said. ""It was an accident, but I'm so happy it bounced back to me."" Harden said he never saw it coming. ""I didn't even know what happened,"" Harden said. ""I think the ball somehow came back into his hands ... wish I would have seen it.""","401071286"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Grizzlies center Marc Gasol snapped out of a recent slump with a more energized performance to help Memphis end a six-game slide. Gasol had 26 points and 14 rebounds, and Memphis led from the second quarter on in a 96-86 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. Gasol had played poorly in recent games but converted 9 of 16 shots, including 3 of 5 from outside the arc, to help the Grizzlies lead by 16 during the fourth quarter. With four minutes left, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich had all reserves in the game. ""(He) came out aggressive, came out assertive and you could see the energy in his face and his actions. That's the guy we need, and he knows it,"" Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley said of Gasol. In the previous two games, Gasol was held to single-digit scoring and missed all six of his 3-point attempts. Against the Spurs, the Grizzlies center was much more animated and engaged. ""I was trying to be a little more aggressive, obviously, and stay aggressive,"" Gasol said. ""It wasn't just where I had one quarter that I was aggressive, I've got to build on it and create those habits for the team."" Conley added 15 points and six assists for Memphis, and Jaren Jackson Jr. and JaMychal Green scored 12 points each. Marco Belinelli and Bryn Forbes scored 14 points apiece for the Spurs, who ended a five-game winning streak. LaMarcus Aldridge and Patty Mills had 13 points each for San Antonio. ""I thought both teams were pretty sloppy in the first half,"" Popovich said. ""Neither team played that well in the first half, but I thought they picked it up in the second half."" San Antonio shot 36 percent and committed 15 turnovers. Aldridge was 4-of-12 shooting, Forbes went 5 of 14, and leading-scorer DeMar DeRozan made just 4 of 15 with nine points. The Spurs 86 points were a season low. Memphis held a 42-31 lead at the half, maintained the lead after three periods and stretched the advantage to 16 when Gasol converted a 3-pointer with 3:16 left. ""That sense of urgency is the way we have to play every single night,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. TIP-INS Spurs: F Rudy Gay missed his second straight game with a sprained left wrist. ... DeRozan's nine points marked only the second game this season where he was held under 10. ... Davis Bertans was ejected in the third quarter when he collected his second technical of the game. ... San Antonio's 31 first-half points matched a season low in a half. Grizzlies: The game marked the first home appearance for G Justin Holiday, obtained in a trade with the Chicago Bulls last Friday. He finished with six points. ... Memphis, among the league leaders in blocks at six per game, had a half dozen at halftime and finished with eight, including three by Kyle Anderson. ... Gasol recorded his 16th double-double. WHAT GOES UP... All was not perfect for Gasol. With about eight minutes left in the third, Gasol headed down the lane and cocked his arm for a big dunk, but it clanked it off the rim. ""Gravity is a hell of a thing,"" Gasol said with a laugh ""I gave him five of 10,"" Conley said. ""He got halfway there.""","401071287"
"NEW ORLEANS --  The New Orleans Pelicans weren't concerned when the Cavaliers went 8 for 8 from beyond the arc to build a 13-point first-quarter lead. ""It's like the stock market,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""At some point, there has to be an adjustment."" New Orleans pounced when the Cavaliers cooled. Anthony Davis had 38 points and 13 rebounds, and the Pelicans came alive in the second half to beat Cleveland 140-126 on Wednesday night. The Cavs hit just 8 of 22 3-pointers in the final three quarters, while New Orleans scored 41 points in the third quarter and 40 in the fourth for a runaway victory. Davis had 18 points in the third quarter alone. ""Obviously if you have back to back 40-point quarters, your offense is working pretty well,"" Gentry said. In the second half, the Pelicans shot 67.6 percent (25 of 37) from the floor, 38.5 percent (5 of 13) on 3-pointers and 96.3 percent (26 OF 27) on free throws. The Cavaliers lost their 11th in a row. They built a 16-point second-quarter lead before cooling off and letting the Pelicans finish the second quarter on a 12-2 run. ""We made a push before halftime,"" guard Jrue Holiday said, ""and we broke it open after that."" Four other Pelicans scored in double figures as Frank Jackson scored 19, Holiday added 18 and Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle had 17 each. The Pelicans won their third straight game for the first time since Nov. 16-19. All 10 Pelicans who played scored, and the team shot well throughout. ""I thought we did some good things in spurts, but we didn't sustain,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""We just have to buckle down and try to put four solid quarters together, which we haven't been able to do."" Cleveland's bench outscored the starters. Jordan Clarkson led the reserves with 21 points, Matthew Dellavedova had 17, Cameron Payne had 16 and Ante Zizic had 10 as the group totaled 75 points. Alec Burks led the starters with 17 points, and Collin Sexton added 13. ""The problem tonight was not the offense,"" Drew said. ""It was the defense."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. did not play because of an injury to his right knee that he suffered a night earlier in a game against Indiana. ... The Cavaliers allowed a season-high in points five days after the Pelicans handed them their most lopsided loss of the season, 133-98 in Cleveland. Pelicans: F Nikola Mirotic returned after a 12-game absence due to an ankle injury. ...The Pelicans' 41 points in the third quarter tied a season high for points in a period. ... Davis made 12 of 13 free throws in the third quarter, setting a franchise record for both attempts and makes in a quarter. ROOKIE COMING ON Jackson had a season high in points for the second consecutive game. He had 17 in a 114-95 victory against Memphis on Monday night. ""He has a gift,"" Holiday said. ""He's so athletic and so fast in getting to the basket. He's aggressive, and he's a mutant with the way he can jump.""","401071288"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic connected on a 3-pointer to put Dallas ahead for good in the third quarter, then did a couple of other things that make the Mavericks believe they have something special in their 19-year-old rookie. First Doncic disrupted an attempted alley-oop for a steal before an assist on a jump-pass out of a double team from close to half court to DeAndre Jordan near the basket for a dunk to help the Mavericks take control. The Slovenian guard scored 30 points to go with six rebounds, five assists and three steals and Dallas ended a seven-game losing streak against Phoenix with a 104-94 victory over the last-place Suns on Wednesday night. ""Luka does crazy stuff all the time,"" said Jordan, who had 11 points and seven rebounds. ""So I'm not surprised by anything he does."" Maybe even a little too crazy at times, like the high-arching 3-point try from 32 feet -- one of a pair of a-bit-too-long attempts from deep that missed. He was an otherwise solid 8-of-14 shooting in his fourth game with at least 30 points. The Slovenian guard still went 4 of 9 beyond the arc with a four-point play in the first half while finishing four points shy of his career high. Doncic made just 10 of his career-high 16 free-throw attempts as the Mavericks went to the line 45 times, a season high, making 32. ""He's very versatile. He's unselfish,"" said Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov, who has coached Doncic on the Slovenian national team. ""A guy who's playmaking for his teammates and also scoring. I think his defense is getting better."" T.J. Warren scored 20 points for the Suns, who led by eight in the first half before falling a night after ending a six-game losing streak with a 21-point rally in a 115-111 home victory over Sacramento. Scoring leader Devin Booker missed the Kings game and was out again in Dallas with back spasms. Phoenix is a combined 1-13 in back-to-back pairs -- 1-6 on the front end and 0-7 on the back. It was the Suns' first loss to Dallas since a 113-108 defeat in Mexico City almost two years ago. Two of their 10 wins this season came against Dallas at home, including the season opener. Suns rookie Deandre Ayton, drafted two spots ahead of Doncic as the No. 1 overall pick, spent the second half in foul trouble and finished with six points and five rebounds along with five fouls. ""For the first time, I think I ever, went scoreless in the first half and stuff like that just started to get to me a little bit,"" said Ayton, who was 1 of 7 from the field. ""It was just me being the bad egg today. I'm going to apologize to them about this, but yeah, it was a bad game for me."" Harrison Barnes scored 17 points for Dallas, making all 10 of his free throws to offset 3-of-11 shooting. Wesley Matthews had 12 of his 14 points in the second half, including a banked-in 3 for a 96-84 lead with three minutes to go. TIP-INS Suns: Jamal Crawford didn't play, delaying him from becoming the 22nd player with 1,300 games for his career. ... The Suns shot 43 percent, ending a three-game streak of shooting at least 50 percent. The last four-game streak for Phoenix was in January 2015. ... Richaun Holmes had 16 points , six rebounds and five assists. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 14 a night after matching his career high of 26. Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki was ill and missed his fourth game since his season debut at Phoenix on Dec. 13. Before setting an NBA record by appearing in his 21st season with the same franchise, the 40-year-old missed the first 26 games recovering from ankle surgery last April. ... G Dennis Smith Jr. was out with back tightness, the 13th game he's missed this season. Most were because of a right wrist sprain. ... Maxi Kleber had season highs of 13 points and nine rebounds. STANDING ALONE Doncic is the only rookie with multiple 30-point games this season. Ayton, Jaren Jackson of Memphis (fourth pick) and Atlanta's Trae Young (fifth overall pick by Dallas in trade with Hawks) have one apiece. FOUL FEST The Suns matched their season high with 34 fouls, the third time they've reached the mark. Two others besides Ayton had five in Josh Jackson and Elie Okobo, while guard De'Anthony Melton fouled out with 7:06 remaining. Jackson scored 17 points, but just two after halftime.","401071289"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell didn't let a nightmarish start for Utah slow him down after halftime. Mitchell took over the Jazz's offense, hitting several critical baskets and setting up others to help spark a second-half rally that gave his team a 106-93 victory over Orlando on Wednesday night. The second-year guard shot 75 percent from the field after halftime, going 8-of-12, and set up four other baskets with assists. Mitchell finished with 33 points and seven assists, helping Utah win for the third time in four games and improve to 21-21 overall. His performance helped the Jazz overcome the absence of their top two point guards, Ricky Rubio and Dante Exum, who are both sidelined with injuries. ""My biggest thing is not to change the mindset just because we're down two point guards,"" Mitchell said. ""Just being aggressive and making the right reads. That's what I've been doing and that's what I'm going to continue to do."" Joe Ingles added 16 points and seven assists, and Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 14 rebounds. Utah trailed by as many as 21 points in the first half before rallying behind a 25-3 run in the third quarter that completely erased the deficit. The Jazz went 13 of 21 from the field in the quarter while holding Orlando to 5-of-21 shooting. The Magic ran off four straight baskets early in the quarter and took a 72-53 lead on D.J. Augustin's 3-pointer. Utah held Orlando to a single basket over the final 8:42 of the quarter to fuel the team's go-ahead run. Mitchell made three layups and Gobert converted a pair of three-point plays to get Utah within striking distance. Utah took its first lead at 78-75 when Neto capped the run with a pair of layups. ""We did all the little things, making everything harder for them,"" Gobert said. ""They came back in the second half thinking it was going to be easy for them and it was the opposite."" Once the Jazz got warmed up, they never cooled. Mitchell made two baskets and assisted on two others to fuel a 12-1 run and push Utah's lead to 102-89 with 2:02 left. Augustin had 23 points and six assists for Orlando, Nikola Vucevic added 20 points and eight rebounds, and Aaron Gordon had 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Magic ended a six-game trip with four straight losses and fell to 17-24 overall. It marked the third time in the road swing that Orlando blew a double-digit lead after blowing a 19-point advantage to Minnesota and a 15-point lead to the Los Angeles Clippers. ""We've got to be more gritty,"" Gordon said. ""We weren't gritty enough. When they're scoring, we can't let that affect our offense."" Orlando jumped out to a 28-7 lead on the strength of a 22-2 first quarter run, helped by back-to-back 3-pointers by Gordon. Vucevic and Augustin followed with an outside basket apiece to put Orlando ahead by double digits and Vucevic finished it off with a fadeaway jumper. Utah rallied twice in the second quarter, cutting the deficit to 11 the second time on back-to-back baskets from Georges Niang. Issac and Vucevic answered with back-to-back 3-pointers that put the Magic ahead 59-42. The Jazz had no trouble making their rally stick after halftime. ""We kept guarding and then we started to make some shots,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Obviously, we defended the second half pretty darn well."" STEAL THIS Vucevic grabbed a pair of steals in addition to finishing with a double-double. The two steals moved him into a 10th-place tie with Bo Outlaw on Orlando's all-time steals list. Vucevic now has 401 career steals. FAVORING THE BOARDS Derrick Favors collected three rebounds to move into fifth place on the Jazz all-time rebounding list. Favors has 3,973 rebounds with Utah, passing Rich Kelly (3,972). QUOTABLE ""I don't think there's a worse loss than being up significantly and allowing a team to flip the score on you.""

Gordon started 4 of 4 from the field, but missed 10 of his final 13 shots. ... Orlando had more turnovers (6) than baskets (5) in the third quarter.

The Jazz outscored the Magic 52-30 in the paint.","401071290"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Trail Blazers are taking advantage where the schedule allows. CJ McCollum had 24 points and the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away in the final quarter to send the Chicago Bulls to their fifth straight loss, 124-112 on Wednesday night. Jusuf Nurkic had 18 points and eight rebounds but got into foul trouble and came up just short of his fifth straight game with 20 or more points. Portland has won three straight and five of its last six games. Damian Lillard, who leads the team in scoring, said he's been good with letting others take some of the load. Lillard finished with 16 points and 10 assists for his fifth double-double of the season. ""We had a stretch we played against all playoff teams. Not looking down on any of our past few opponents but they've been teams where we've been able to get things that we might not have been able to get against those other teams because we're so familiar with them, their style,"" Lillard said. ""So I've just kind of been letting the game happen, making the right plays and guys have been playing really well."" Wendell Carter Jr. had 22 points to lead the Bulls in the first of a five-game road trip. After a tight first half, the Blazers led by as many as 11 points in the third quarter but the Bulls kept the margin from getting any wider until Meyers Leonard's dunk put Portland up 106-94 with just under eight minutes left in the game. A pair of consecutive 3-pointers from McCollum and Seth Curry put the Blazers up 112-96 and Portland went on to lead by as many as 19 points down the remaining stretch. ""Rebounding and our pick and roll coverage wasn't the best tonight,"" Carter said. ""It was just an effort thing, we didn't stick to the game plan like we were supposed to. We're learning and growing. I have no regrets about what we did tonight. We learn and move on."" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said before the game that Bobby Portis would be on a 24-minute restriction. Portis returned Sunday from a sprained right ankle that kept him out of seven straight games. He finished with 15 points in 19 minutes against the Blazers. Portland was without Maurice Harkless, because of left knee soreness. Jake Layman started in his place. Harkless, who had surgery on the knee last March, has missed 14 games this season because of the knee. The Blazers held a 30-29 edge after a close first quarter but they began to pull away in the second, going up 41-35 after Nic Stauskas' 3-pointer. Portland briefly extended the lead to 10 points and 54-45 but led 56-51 at halftime. CJ McCollum led the Blazers with 12 points at the break, while Zach LaVine had 12 for the Bulls. Nurkic was called for his fourth foul with 6:30 left in the third quarter and headed for the bench. Portland began to pull away late in the quarter, with Seth Curry's 3-pointer putting the Blazers up 95-85. In his seven previous games, Nurkic he averaged 21.9 points and 11.9 rebounds. He had 20 points in Portland's 111-101 victory over the Knicks on Monday. Chicago, which had six players in double figures, fell to the Nets 117-100 on Sunday before embarking on the five-game road trip. The last time the Bulls were in Portland, in January last year, McCollum had 50 points in a 124-108 Blazers' victory. TIP-INS Bulls: Forward Jabari Parker has played in only one of the Bulls' last six games, and has been a coach's decision DNP in eight total games. It has led to speculation that Chicago is seeking to trade the four-year veteran out of Duke. Parker signed a two-year, $40 million deal with the Bulls last July. He has appeared in 30 games with the Bulls this season, with 17 starts, and is averaging 14.9 points and 6.8 rebounds. Trail Blazers: It was the first of two meetings with the Bulls. Portland won both of the games against Chicago last season. ... Lillard was holding his left arm when he came of the court at the end of the third quarter but Portland's trainers did not attend to him, so it did not appear to be serious. ""I went up for an offensive rebound and my arm got caught up and I turned my elbow a little bit,"" he said. BENCH RULES: Portland's bench outscored Chicago's bench 56-41. The Blazers improved to 6-0 when the bench has at least 50 points. ""I liked the activity, more than anything else. I liked the activity and the flow of the second unit,"" `Blazers coach Terry Stotts said.","401071291"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kyle Kuzma scored a career-high 41 points in three quarters against his childhood team, joining some rarified company in the process. His offensive outburst propelled the Los Angeles Lakers over the Detroit Pistons 113-100 on Wednesday night to improve to 3-5 without injured LeBron James. ""Our team has shown a lot of growth from the post-LeBron injury,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. Kuzma had 22 points in the third quarter, hitting four 3-pointers to get the crowd on its feet and scoring on consecutive goaltending calls. He joined Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, James Harden and James with 40-plus points in three quarters this season. ""Pretty cool,"" Kuzma said. ""That's the team I grew up watching. My fondest memories is them beating the Lakers."" Kuzma was a 9-year-old in Flint, Michigan, when the Pistons won the 2004 NBA Finals. He sat out the fourth quarter and put a wrap around his lower back, which has bothered him lately. The second-year forward had scoring runs of 10 and six points in the period, when the Lakers led by 16. ""Everything was in the rhythm of the offense,"" said Kuzma, who put up 500 shots the day before. ""No matter what's going on in the game he believes the next shot's going in,"" Pistons guard Langston Galloway said. Michael Beasley picked up where Kuzma left off, scoring 15 of his 19 points in the fourth on his 30th birthday. His scoring touch had James and other players on the bench on their feet. Detroit's Blake Griffin, averaging a career-high 25.3 points per game, was held to 16. He had no rebounds for the first time in his career, in part because of Kuzma's defense. ""You never want to come in here and have a performance like that, especially when you need wins,"" Griffin said. ""The energy just wasn't there. We just did a poor job managing this trip so far."" Andre Drummond had 17 rebounds and Reggie Jackson added 15 points for the Pistons, who have lost three in a row and six of seven. The Lakers took the lead for good in the second during a 20-7 spurt that pushed their lead to 13. Lonzo Ball's bounce pass in the paint to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope got it going. Ball hit a 3-pointer and Kuzma had five points before James came on the court to cheer his teammates during a timeout. TIP-INS Pistons: F Zaza Pachulia (bruised right lower leg) sat out. Lakers: James (left groin strain) is set to be re-evaluated Friday and won't travel with the team for its game in Utah. ... Rajon Rondo (right ring finger surgery) has also missed eight games. ... The Lakers had a 72-44 edge in the paint. ... Tyson Chandler was given the night off.

"MIAMI --  Dwyane Wade knew the Boston Celtics would make a run. He also decided when it should end. Wade scored eight of his 19 points in a third-quarter spurt that saved Miami from what was starting to look like a freefall, and the Heat went on to defeat the Celtics 115-99 on Thursday night. Miami led by as many as 26 shortly after halftime, then saw the Celtics peel off 16 unanswered points before Wade helped quickly restore order. ""I've been on this train with him for a long time,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He has a way of making all of us look a lot better. ... Sometimes this league is just about having great players in those important moments, swing moments during the course of a game."" Josh Richardson scored 18 points for Miami, which set season highs with 18 3-pointers and 33 assists. Derrick Jones Jr. scored 14, and Justise Winslow scored 13 points and added a career-high 11 assists for the Heat. ""We're trying to move up. We're trying to continue to get better,"" said Wade, who helped the Heat even their record at 20-20. ""You want to be able to win some of these games against the top teams."" Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 22 on 10-for-19 shooting for the Celtics, who scored a season-high 135 points one night earlier in a win over Indiana -- but were held under 100 for only the fourth time all season, the first since Nov. 17. Irving went to the Heat practice court immediately after the game, shooting for about 30 minutes. ""Just good to get some shots up, just release some stress a little bit after a tough loss,"" Irving said. Marcus Smart scored 18, and Jayson Tatum and Marcus Morris each had 17 for the Celtics. Miami outscored Boston 17-4 in the final 3:07 of the first half and took a 61-43 lead into the break -- the largest halftime edge for the Heat since November. And an 11-3 run to start the third pushed the lead out to 72-46, which would seem to indicate that Miami was in complete control. Looks were deceiving. Boston scored the next 16 points, with Tatum getting six of them and the Celtics were right back in the game. Wade made a 3-pointer to stop the run, and scored eight points in the final 3:47 of the quarter as the Heat took an 83-72 lead into the final 12 minutes. Tyler Johnson got a pair of 3s to fall in a 67-second span early in the fourth, and just like that Miami was back up 95-76. ""They really, really shot it and made big ones when we came back in the second half to stymie that,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""But that's a result of being comfortable all night."" TIP-INS Celtics: Boston trailed for 4:04 in its last four games, combined. It trailed for 4:14 in the first quarter alone Thursday. ... Boston has now lost three straight to Miami, the first time that's happened since 2012. Heat: It was Miami's 400th consecutive home sellout. ... Winslow wore ""RIP Sammy Farkas"" on his sneakers, a tribute to a Miami Beach teen who died in a fall earlier this week. ... Jones made a 40-footer to end the first half, and had a 60-footer to end the third quarter hit the rim and bounce off. ... James Johnson got rave reviews from teammates for dunking on Irving in the opening minutes. ""Definitely nice,"" Tyler Johnson said. HELLO, AGAIN Boston and Miami didn't play each other in 2018 -- the last meeting between the clubs, before Thursday, came on Dec. 20, 2017. The Celtics played every other NBA team at least once in 2018; the Heat played every team besides Boston and Golden State, who they last faced on Dec. 3, 2017 and won't see for the first time this year until Feb. 10 in Oakland. NOTHING EASY The game's first free throw came more than 17 minutes after tip-off, when Winslow got to the line for Miami. Boston didn't take a free throw until 10:31 remained in the third quarter.","401071293"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic wowed his teammates with a perfect full-court pass that led to a dunk and by tossing a pass to himself off the backboard for a layup. The Denver Nuggets big man was the one wide-eyed after the game when he met Broncos pass rusher Von Miller and exchanged jerseys. Another eventful evening for Jokic. The player nicknamed Joker finished with 18 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his 21st career triple-double to help the Western Conference-leading Nuggets extend their home winning streak to 11 by cruising past the Los Angeles Clippers 121-100 on Thursday night. ""Another triple-double,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""The guy continues to amaze."" Jokic did a little bit of everything, including the pass of the night when he lofted a full-length strike over a defender to Jamal Murray for a dunk in the third quarter. ""He could play for NFL teams the way he passes the ball,"" Malone said. Later, Jokic picked up his dribble on a play, saw the path through the lane was clear, banked it off the glass to himself and put it in. It was something he had never tried in a game before. And no, he wasn't thinking slam. ""I knew he wasn't going to dunk it,"" Murray cracked. ""It was a smart move. It was a great play."" This capped off the night: Jokic and Miller exchanging jerseys. ""It means a lot. I watched him a lot,"" Jokic said. ""He's a beast. He's someone that can't be stopped."" These days, the same can be said of Jokic, who was coming off a game in Miami on Tuesday in which he had 29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. ""He's just a great player,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Murray scored 23 points and Mason Plumlee added a season-high 17 points to go with 12 rebounds for the Nuggets. They're now 17-3 at home. Lou Williams led the Clippers with 19 points, and Danilo Gallinari chipped in 18 against his former team. Denver built the lead to 102-81 with 9:03 remaining on a jumper by Monte Morris. The Clippers made a little run, but Morris silenced it with a 3-pointer. ""They just kicked our butt from the beginning,"" said Tobias Harris, who finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds. ""Their intensity and pace, we were kind of on our heels with all night. We've got to respect that especially from a team that's No. 1 in the West."" Gallinari received applause from the crowd when he was announced. He joined the Clippers last season after a bulk of his career in Denver. He was limited to 21 games with Los Angeles in 2017-18 due to injuries and didn't suit up when the Clippers played in the Mile High City. ""It was a good feeling to see a lot of my friend and people that I know,"" Gallinari said. ""But honestly I was just focused on the game plan and trying to play my game and trying to help the team."" TIP-INS Clippers: F Luc Mbah a Moute remains out with a sore left knee.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs started hotter than ever from 3-point range Thursday night. When that wasn't enough to put away the Oklahoma City Thunder, San Antonio got the extra push it needed from its big man in the middle. LaMarcus Aldridge scored a career-high 56 points and the Spurs overcame Russell Westbrook's triple-double to outlast the Oklahoma City Thunder 154-147 in double-overtime. ""He carried us,"" Spurs point guard Derrick White said. ""It was fun to watch."" San Antonio set a franchise record by making its first 14 3-pointers and was 16 of 19 overall from deep, but it still needed two overtime periods to topple Oklahoma City, in part because Westbrook had 24 points, 24 assists and 13 rebounds. Aldridge had seven points in the second overtime and White added four points, a steal and a critical block of Jerami Grant at the rim with San Antonio up 148-144 with less than two minutes remaining. White finished with 23 points and Marco Belinelli made all five of his 3-point attempts while scoring 19 points for the Spurs, who have won seven straight at home. ""He's been a beast all year long,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said of Aldridge. ""He anchors us at both ends of the floor. He did it last year, and he's doing it this year, too. He's just been fantastic. Obviously, he had a great night."" Aldridge was 20 for 33 from the field and 16 for 16 on free throws in surpassing his previous career high of 45 points, which he set against Utah on March 23, 2018. ""I was just complaining about (not scoring 50 points) like two weeks ago,"" Aldridge said. ""That I feel like it should have happened in my career."" The Spurs have won six of seven and 14 of 18 to close within a game of the Thunder for third place in the Western Conference. ""For it to go down to the wire with a team that's hot like that, we have a lot to take away for us, for how we played,"" Oklahoma City forward Paul George said. The Thunder lost their seventh straight in San Antonio despite Westbrook's huge game. George scored 30 points, and Grant added 25 points and 12 rebounds but fouled out with 25 seconds remaining in the second overtime. Westbrook had only three turnovers in 50 minutes. ""I take a lot of pride (in triple-doubles),"" Westbrook said. ""I do other things that impact winning, impact the team and then I feel like I'm the best at all those other things. So, I do it every night."" Oklahoma City entered the game having held opponents to 33.3 percent shooting from 3-point range, the third-lowest in the league, but the Thunder couldn't contain San Antonio early. Belinelli made three consecutive 3-pointers in less than a minute in the opening quarter, and the Spurs made all 10 of their 3s in the first half to build a 16-point lead. Oklahoma City rallied and tied it at 114 with six minutes remaining in regulation when Steven Adams made consecutive follows off misses by Westbrook. Adams limped off the court with an ankle injury with 5 1/2 minutes remaining and didn't return for the close of regulation but did play in both overtime periods. Aldridge scored eight consecutive points with Adams out, but consecutive 3-pointers by Terrance Ferguson tied it again at 126. After the Spurs essentially abandoned the 3-pointer after their hot start, White drained a 3 to put San Antonio up 129-126. With the Spurs up 130-128, Belinelli had the ball stolen at midcourt, leading to a tying layup by Grant with 5.6 seconds left. DeMar DeRozan missed a jumper at the close of regulation. DeRozan missed another jumper with 0.3 seconds left in the first extra period and the Thunder could not put up a shot at the buzzer as White tipped the inbounds pass from Westbrook. DeRozan finished with 16 points and 11 assists, but shot 7 for 22 from the field. TIP-INS Thunder: San Antonio's 16 3-pointers tied the most Oklahoma City has allowed this season, which came Nov. 19 at Sacramento. ... The Thunder's last win in San Antonio was Dec. 25, 2014. Spurs: Aldridge has 17,758 career points, passing Magic Johnson for 78th on the NBA's career list. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Buddy Hield scored 18 points, Willie Cauley-Stein had 14 points and 14 rebounds, and the Sacramento Kings beat the Detroit Pistons 112-102 on Thursday night with Blake Griffin out for rest. Iman Shumpert had 13 points and De'Aaron Fox had 12 points and six assists for the Kings, who had lost five of six. Stanley Johnson had 16 points off the bench, Reggie Bullock added 15 points and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Pistons, who have lost four straight and 9 of 11. Griffin, Detroit's scoring leader, got the night off after playing 37 minutes Wednesday night in a 113-100 loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. He did not have a rebound in that game, the first time that had happened in his eight-year pro career. The Kings went 9 for 22 from behind the 3-point line (40.9 percent) against a Pistons team that entered as the NBA's best in defending against 3-pointers, holding opponents to 31.9 percent shooting. Sacramento entered second in the NBA in shooting 3s at 39 percent. Detroit went 11 for 38 on 3s, with Bullock hitting three of them. The Kings were coming off one of their worst losses of the season, blowing a 21-point second-half lead in a 115-111 defeat Tuesday night at Phoenix, the worst team in the Western Conference. Sacramento never trailed, starting the game with a 13-2 spurt and leading 34-21 after one period. The Kings held a 65-48 halftime lead and maintained that 17-point margin at the end of three quarters. They took their biggest lead of the night, 102-79, with about eight minutes left.

"PHILADELPHIA --  Jimmy Butler had 30 fateful seconds in the fourth to forget. The Philadelphia 76ers star guard lost the ball in a tie game on a drive down the lane that led to Atlanta's John Collins finding separation and burying a fadeaway jumper with 25 seconds left for the lead. Butler had a chance at atonement -- he was 12 for 12 at the free-throw line and had two shots with 2.4 seconds left. First shot, rattle and miss. Second shot, clang off the back of the rim. Wilson Chandler slipped under the basket on the second attempt and missed his gimmie tip-in at the horn that helped the Hawks hang on to beat the Sixers 123-121 on Friday night. ""I hope we're still together,"" Butler said. ""Nobody pointing fingers at anybody."" There were at least a few raised eyebrows after the hapless Hawks (13-29) sent the Sixers to just their fourth home loss of the season. The Sixers struggled with All-Star center Joel Embiid out with a sore ankle suffered in a loss to Washington on Wednesday. His presence was missed -- Embiid leads the 76ers with averages of 26.9 points and 13.4 rebounds in 40 games -- and the Hawks pounced. Atlanta crushed the Sixers with 62 points in the paint and outrebounded Philly 44-30. ""You can start all over the place and whether it's Joel or not Joel, you know we should be better defensively,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""It's where we anchored our program and at the moment, we are poor. Right now, lately, we have been poor."" The Hawks were happy to capitalize and hit 12 3s and shot 56 percent overall from the floor. Collins scored 25 points and Kevin Huerter hit five 3s and led the Hawks with 29 points. ""I had a pretty good rhythm in the fourth quarter and we just kind of kept running plays that were working for us,"" Huerter said. Butler led the Sixers with 30 points and Ben Simmons had 23 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. The game turned into a 3-point shootout late -- the teams combined for 23; seven in the fourth. JJ Redick, who missed the last two games with a sore back, led a comeback in the fourth with a pair of 3-pointers that tied the game each time. TJ McConnell put the 76ers ahead by one with 2:39 left. Huerter buried a 3 to tie it at 121. Butler had his first major miscue when he lost the ball on a drive down the lane that was recovered by Atlanta. Collins hit the jumper and that was enough for the lowly Hawks. ""We just got to fix it,"" Butler said. ""I think we're going to be fine. All I know is, everybody's in there. We're in it together. We're not going separate ways."" TIP-INS Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce made a homecoming of sorts after spending five years on Brown's staff with the Sixers. Pierce said he owed Brown so much for helping him become a head coach. Brown said Pierce was one of his first hires as ""The Process"" began in 2013. ""It is not a me versus them, it's still us. It's about us,"" Pierce said. 76ers: Brown said G Markelle Fultz (thoracic outlet syndrome) is undergoing therapy in Philadelphia and may rejoin the team soon. ... Justin Patton (broken foot) could return in early February. ... Zhaire Smith (foot) has individual workouts, but has not yet practiced with the team this season. FOMO The 76ers will retire Moses Malone's No. 2 in a halftime ceremony of the Feb. 8 game against Denver. The Sixers also will unveil a Malone sculpture on their Legends Walk at team headquarters in New Jersey. Malone was a three-time NBA MVP, 13-time All-Star (12 times in NBA, once in ABA), Hall of Fame inductee and member of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history. In 1983, he helped the Sixers roll through the playoffs and sweep the Lakers in the finals -- the last time they won a championship. Before the playoffs that year, Malone was asked about the team's prospects. He is remembered as much for his answer to that question as he is for his dominance on the court. ""Fo', fo', fo',"" Malone said, predicting three straight sweeps. WHAT A DRAG Late in the third, Alex Len planted an elbow in Butler's face on the block that knocked the four-time All-Star to the ground. Butler remained seated and appeared to exchange words with Len. McConnell yanked Butler by the right shoulder and dragged him about 15 feet to the free-throw line to keep the tension from escalating. The refs threw it to New York for a review and Len was hit with a flagrant foul.","401071297"
"WASHINGTON --  Tomas Satoransky got a bottled-water shower from his teammates and a postgame handshake from team president Ernie Grunfeld. The big game for the lanky Czech point guard was cause for celebration for the Washington Wizards, who are playing cohesively with Satoransky starting in place of the injured John Wall. Satoransky had 18 points, a career-high 12 rebounds and 10 assists in his first career triple-double, helping Washington beat the Milwaukee Bucks 113-106 on Friday night. Bradley Beal scored 32 points for the Wizards, who won for the third time in four games. Beal threw down an alley-oop for Satoransky's last assist, making it 111-101 with 1:43 remaining. ""Shout out to Brad, because he called that play,"" Satoransky said. ""It was all love from him."" With Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined by hip and quad injuries, Washington came out aggressively and never trailed after the opening two minutes. The Wizards finished with 18 3-pointers, matching the franchise record. Trevor Ariza scored 20 points, including 18 in the second half, and made six 3-pointers. Jeff Green went 4 for 7 from beyond the arc on his way to 20 points, helping Washington shoot 54.5 percent (18 of 33) from 3-point range. It was the Wizards' first game this season making more than 50 percent of their 3s. ""We've been passing the ball well. We've been spacing it well,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""With Trevor, he was bound to make some of his 3s."" Washington improved to 7-4 without Wall this season and 5-3 since the injury that forced the Wizards' highest-paid player to undergo season-ending surgery on his left knee. The Wizards also traded away Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers while adding Ariza. ""Our team is totally different from the beginning of the year,"" said Beal, who scored 30 or more for the 10th time this season. ""It's just a matter of us getting it together, and I think we're finally at that point to where we can turn the corner. ""We're just dedicated to playing hard and playing the right way. I don't know what it is. Maybe a switch clicked on or whatever it is, but we're clicking at the right time and we have a good group of guys in here who just want to continue to get better and want to win."" Khris Middleton scored 25 points for the Bucks, who had won 11 of 13. Eric Bledsoe had 18 points and nine assists. ""To play the way we want to play, you've got to move, move people, move the ball,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We were just a little stagnant."" Washington used a 13-2 run to open an early 34-22 lead. Beal converted a three-point play and made a 3-pointer during the stretch, and Satoransky also made a 3. Malcolm Brogdon helped steady the Bucks in the second quarter with 11 points on 4-of-4 shooting. Washington led 57-47 at halftime and pushed back ahead after Milwaukee tied it twice in the third quarter. The Bucks fell to 2-1 this season without Antetokounmpo. ""It's an adjustment. If any of the starters were out, it would be an adjustment, but when Giannis is out, it's even a bigger adjustment,"" Brogdon said. ""That was a winnable game for us even though Giannis was out. That's on us to take a bigger role."" PLACE YOUR (FREE) BETS Friday night marked the debut of a gambling-focused telecast on the Wizards' regional TV partner, NBC Sports Washington.

"NEW YORK --  Beaten badly in Boston, the Indiana Pacers shifted their energy to finishing their road trip with a winning record. It helped that it ended in a building where Domantas Sabonis barely misses. Sabonis had 22 points and 15 rebounds to cap his sizzling season at Madison Square Garden, and Indiana bounced back from its worst performance of 2018-19 by beating the New York Knicks 121-106 on Friday night. Victor Oladipo added 19 points for the Pacers, who finished 3-2 on their longest trip of the season. They yielded season highs of 135 points and 56.8 percent shooting in their 27-point loss in Boston, and spent two days talking about finishing strong. ""Even though we were 2-2 we felt like we hadn't played our best basketball,"" Oladipo said, ""and I think we came out today with a chip on our shoulder and we did a great job of using that intensity and that edge and going out there and playing with that chip."" And with energy and anger. Oladipo threw down a dunk over Mario Hezonja, and Sabonis and Bojan Bogdanovic both had powerful slams in the first half. Sabonis shot 9 for 14 from the field to finish 21 of 26 this season in two games in New York. Playing as a reserve, he made all 12 shots and tied his career high with 30 points when the Pacers won here on Halloween. Starting this time with Myles Turner out of the lineup, he led six players in double figures as Indiana shot 52 percent. He couldn't explain why he is so good in New York. ""I treat every game the same way,"" he said. ""Come out, my teammates do a great job of finding me and I just try to do my job."" Bogdanovic had 15 points. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 21 points for the Knicks, back from a lengthy, six-game road trip and playing their first game at Madison Square Garden since Christmas. They lost their seventh straight at home. ""It felt good to play here,"" rookie Kevin Knox said. ""Not the result we wanted, but it felt good to finally be back at Madison Square Garden."" New York battled back from 13 down to take the lead on Tim Hardaway Jr.'s second straight 3-pointer, but with the game tied, Indiana scored the final 12 points, with Oladipo hitting consecutive 3-pointers, to make it 64-52 at halftime. Bogdanovic then opened and closed a 16-7 spurt out of the locker room with 3-pointers to open an 80-59 cushion. Hardaway played just a minute of the fourth quarter before leaving for good because he was cramping. He said he expected to be fine. TIP-INS Pacers: Turner has a sore right shoulder. ... The Pacers have won the last five meetings. Knicks: New York played without Enes Kanter (illness), Frank Ntilikina (sprained left ankle) and Mitchell Robinson (sprained left ankle). ... Knox was presented with the Eastern Conference rookie of the month award for December before the game. ... The Knicks celebrated Croatian heritage night. Hezonja and Bogdanovic are Croatian, with Bogdanovic the leading scorer in the 2016 Olympics with 25.3 points per game. PORZINGIS PROGRESS Knicks coach David Fizdale said the team is leaning toward leaving Kristaps Porzingis home next week when the Knicks travel to London to play Washington, believing that is better for the All-Star forward's rehabilitation from his torn ACL than traveling. Fizdale said he spoke Friday with Porzingis, who is scheduled to be re-evaluated in about a month. He said Porzingis' spirits were positive. ""Obviously he misses playing, that part has been hard,"" Fizdale said, ""but he's starting to get stronger, so he's feeling better. And he seems to be in a really good place."" STOMACH SICKNESS? Kanter posted a video of his ""cheat day"" meal on Wednesday, with seven burgers and a plate of fries on the table in front of him. He then missed practice Thursday and the game Friday because of illness, leading to speculation that he had ate himself sick. But Fizdale thought there was no way Kanter actually ate all that food. ""The guy walks around with his shirt off all day in the locker room. There's no way he's stuffing seven burgers down his face. I just don't see that,"" Fizdale said. ""I think sometimes people take the `gram too seriously.""","401071299"
"TORONTO --  The Brooklyn Nets needed one more victory to match their best stretch in four years. Instead, they stumbled in Toronto -- again. Kawhi Leonard had 20 points and 11 rebounds, Pascal Siakam scored 16 points and the Raptors beat the Nets 122-105 on Friday night for their second seven-game home winning streak of the season. ""I rarely say this about our team, but I didn't love the effort tonight,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""To beat an elite team on the road, our effort and execution was nowhere near where it needed to be. I think we got dominated all around."" Brooklyn entered with 13 wins in their previous 17 games, a run that began with a 106-105 overtime victory over Toronto on Dec. 7. The Nets last won 14 of 18 in the 2013-14 season. Toronto has won 13 of the past 14 meetings with the Nets, including seven straight north of the border. Brooklyn hasn't won in Toronto since Feb. 4, 2015. ""We've made strides but we have a long way to go,"" Atkinson said. ""This is a little bit of a humble pie, going up against an elite team like this."" Brooklyn's past four losses have all been double-digit defeats. Serge Ibaka added 14 points, OG Anunoby and Norman Powell each had 13, Delon Wright had 12 to help Toronto improve to 18-4 at home. They last lost at home Dec. 9 to Milwaukee. Toronto set a season high with 105 shots and had 32 assists on 48 baskets. The Raptors are 8-0 when they have 30 or more assists. ""It's what we're looking for, a total team effort,"" said guard Fred VanVleet, one of five Toronto reserves to score at least 10 points. The Raptors finished with 60 bench points, two shy of a season-high. Toronto has won four straight overall and six of seven. Its only loss in that span was Jan. 3 at San Antonio. ""They capitalized on our turnovers, they capitalized on our missed shots,"" said Brooklyn guard D'Angelo Russell, who led the Nets with 24 points. Shabazz Napier added 15 points for Brooklyn, and Jarrett Allen had 12 rebounds. Leonard was working out following the game and did not speak to reporters. Russell scored 12 points in the first and the Nets closed the quarter with a 14-3 run to lead 35-28 after one. It was Brooklyn's highest-scoring first quarter on the road this season. Toronto turned the tables in the second, overcoming a one-point deficit by outscoring Brooklyn 15-3 over the final 2:55. The Raptors outscored the Nets 36-18 in the second and led 64-53 at halftime. ""The rest of the game they dominated us, basically,"" Atkinson said. Siakam scored nine points and Ibaka had eight as the Raptors pulled away in the third, connecting on 16 of 32 shots. Toronto took a 99-75 lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Russell had six rebounds in the first, the most he's ever had in a quarter. ... Russell finished with nine assists. ...

"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets still have a way to go to reach their goal of earning the top seed in the Western Conference. But it seems far more attainable than it was just a month ago. James Harden had 43 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in 29 minutes -- the first player in NBA history to have a 40-point triple-double in less than 30 minutes played -- to lead the Houston Rockets to a 141-113 rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night for their eighth win in 11 games. ""I think we've all had that in the back of our mind. It was just a far reach earlier in the season,"" Harden said. ""Now it's pretty close. We've just got to continue to do what we've been doing. Playing well, taking care of opportunities like this tonight. Just continue to get better, strive to get better."" The Rockets, who were in 14th place in the West in early December, are 4  1/2 games out of first place and tied with the Clippers for fifth. After the Cavaliers got a 117-108 win in the first meeting with Houston this season, the Rockets were determined to take care of business this time around. They did that, racing out to a 28-point lead after scoring a season-high 77 points in the first half behind 24 points from Harden. It's Harden's 15th straight game with at least 30 points, his franchise-record 13th game with 40 points this season and the seventh in the last nine games as he has carried the team with Chris Paul and Eric Gordon out with injuries. Ante Zizic came off the bench to score 18 for the Cavaliers, whose season-long skid extended to 12 games. ""We just couldn't stop them,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""They were raining 3s all over the place. They broke us down off the dribble. They are in a rhythm now and playing very good basketball."" Harden needed less than 2 1/2 quarters to reach 30 points on Friday night, hitting a 3 with 7:41 left in the third to give him 32 points and push Houston's lead 91-58. He joins Kobe Bryant (16 games in 2003) as the only players to score 30 points in at least 15 games in a row since the 1972-73 season. About three minutes later, he pushed his total to 40 after he was left wide open to drive into the lane for an easy layup to make it 99-68. Harden grabbed his 10th rebound with about 90 seconds left in the third quarter to give him his sixth triple-double this season and the 41st of his career. Harden played just 29 minutes and 34 seconds, and made eight 3-pointers to extend his NBA record to 12 games in a row with at least five. ""The step-back 3s, he's perfected that,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""He's got 16 3s and they're all step-backs. I don't know how he does it ... everybody knows what he's doing and he still gets them off, and they're kind of open. They're not forced, so he's just an incredible player."" Clint Capela added 19 points on 7-of-8 shooting after making just four of 16 field goals in a loss to Milwaukee on Wednesday night. Harden and fellow starters Capela and Tucker also sat out the fourth quarter with Houston up 113-81 entering the fourth. Even with the trio watching the final quarter from the bench, the Rockets maintained a huge lead and their 141 points were a season high and the most Cleveland has allowed this season. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Rodney Hood returned after missing the last three games with a sore left Achilles tendon. He had six points, two assists and two rebounds in 18 minutes. ... Cedi Osman had 15 points and Collin Sexton added 14. ... Jordan Clarkson and Jalen Jones added 12 points each. Rockets: Paul missed his 10th game in a row with a strained left hamstring. ...

Tucker boxed out a couple of Cavaliers and avoided grabbing the ball to help Harden collect his 10th rebound on Friday night. Tucker joked that Harden might owe him for the move. ""Dinner, movies. I need a date,"" Tucker joked. Later, Harden was asked if Tucker deserves dinner for helping him get his triple-double. ""I took P.J. to dinner, movies, Europe,"" Harden said laughing. ""I take P.J. everywhere with me. He gets enough already.""","401071301"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Luka Doncic nearly recorded a triple-double, falling just two rebounds short. The final score was the only set of numbers he was focused on. Doncic scored 29 points and hit the go-ahead 3-pointer to lead the Dallas Mavericks over the Minnesota Timberwolves 119-115 on Friday night, spoiling rookie coach Ryan Saunders' home debut. Doncic, who helped secure the win by scoring seven of Dallas' final nine points, also finished with 12 assists and eight rebounds. ""I don't care about that,"" Doncic said of nearly getting the triple-double. ""We've just got to win. That's all that matters."" Harrison Barnes scored 23 points, while JJ Barea and Dwight Powell came off the bench to score 16 and 15 points, respectively, for the Mavericks. Dallas (20-22) had entered the game 4-11 in its previous 15 games and was 3-18 on the road. ""We showed a lot of resilience,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Tough game, tough crowd. The road's been a challenge for us all year. I loved the way we hung in. I really did."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 30 points and 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves (20-22), who were playing their first home game since Saunders was named interim coach. Taj Gibson gave Minnesota the lead at 115-114 with a tip-in of Jeff Teague's miss with 35.7 seconds left. But with 22.9 to play, Doncic hit a pull-up 3 to put the Mavericks ahead for good. ""That's what he does so far for us,"" Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki said. ""He's been a great closer for us."" Derrick Rose scored 21 points for Minnesota, while Andrew Wiggins added 17 and Josh Okogie hit a season-high four 3s, finishing with 15 points. The Timberwolves trailed most of the game after shooting only 36.4 percent from the floor in the first half. But a 12-2 run in the fourth quarter tied the game. And with 1:41, left Towns gave Minnesota its first lead since the first quarter with a jump hook. ""We played the tempo we wanted in the second half, got ourselves back in the game, played well,"" Towns said. ""Just some things didn't go our way throughout the night and it led to our demise. We also hurt ourselves, too."" Doncic took over down the stretch. Before the winning 3, he hit a tough runner and put down a dunk in traffic. All three gave the Mavericks the lead and all three came in the final 1:28. ""He's a talent,"" Saunders said. ""Big-time players make big-time plays. He made one tonight and we're feeling it."" Saunders, who received a loud ovation from the Target Center crowd before the game, took over as coach after Tom Thibodeau was relieved of his duties Sunday. He won his first game in charge Tuesday at Oklahoma City. Saunders is the son of the late Flip Saunders, the winningest coach in Timberwolves history. A banner hangs in the Target Center rafters in honor of Flip Saunders, who died in 2015. ""Obviously, disappointing, especially in front of the home crowd,"" Ryan Saunders said. ""We had a lot of easy looks, I thought. They just didn't fall for us early. The second half, we didn't do a great job in terms of communicating as a team. So, that's something we've got to get better with moving forward."" Derrick Rose scored 21 points, Andrew Wiggins scored 17 points and Josh Okogie scored 15 and hit a season-high four 3s for Minnesota. FOLLOWING IN DAD'S FOOTSTEPS Carlisle called it emotional to see Saunders coaching the Timberwolves. Before Friday's game, Carlisle recalled borrowing Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's plane to attend Flip Saunders' funeral along with fellow NBA coaches including Doc Rivers and Scott Brooks. Carlisle and Ryan Saunders have talked often since Flip Saunders' death. ""You never know what's going to happen,"" Carlisle said. ""But this opportunity is something that is great for him. He's built so similarly to his dad in terms of his character, in terms of his amazing way with people and his positive view on everything.""

"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Utah Jazz played without point guards Ricky Rubio, Dante Exum and Raul Neto because of injuries, and it was no big deal. Not with Donovan Mitchell showing off his ball-handling skills. Mitchell had 33 points and a career-high nine assists, helping Utah beat the Los Angeles Lakers 113-95 on Friday night. The second-year guard helped make up for his missing teammates with a flurry of game-changing plays on both ends of the court. ""My biggest thing is just trying to make the right reads,"" Mitchell said. ""That's been my thing since I first got here. Just continuing to play under control and just find guys."" Utah (22-21) made 15 3-pointers in its fourth win in five games. Rudy Gobert had 12 points and a season-high 18 rebounds. Joe Ingles collected 14 points and a career-high 12 boards, and Derrick Favors finished with 15 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. The Jazz enjoyed a 65-55 advantage on the glass, marking the eighth time in franchise history they had at least 65 rebounds. Michael Beasley scored 17 points for the Lakers. Brandon Ingram added 15 points and Kyle Kuzma had 11 points and eight rebounds. Los Angeles (23-20) lost for the sixth time in nine games without LeBron James in the lineup. James is out with a groin injury. The Lakers shot just 36 percent from the floor. ""We couldn't ever get a rhythm going,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""We couldn't find it. Once we were struggling to score, we let that affect our overall energy, which is something we talk about. It's a good learning experience for our guys."" Utah broke the game open in the second quarter by holding Los Angeles without a field goal for nearly seven minutes. The Lakers trailed 41-34 after Ivica Zubac scored back-to-back baskets with 7:35 left. They did not get another basket until Javale McGee hit a short jumper with 55.1 seconds left in the half. Utah took advantage of the drought. The Jazz used an 18-4 run to open a 59-38 lead. Mitchell fueled much of the run with his play on both ends of the court. He drove for a pair of baskets, blocked a layup attempt by Kyle Kuzma, and fed a no-look pass to Ingles in the corner to set up his first 3-pointer of the night. ""We guarded,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We defended well. We still have to work at scoring off our defense."" Los Angeles trimmed Utah's lead to 76-66 in the third quarter after Beasley made back-to-back baskets and hit a pair of free throws as part of a 10-0 run. The Lakers couldn't cut it to single digits. Utah used a 14-5 run, capped by a layup from Gobert, to put it out of reach again and take a 95-73 lead with 7:03 left in the fourth quarter. PERIMETER PRECISION Royce O'Neale made his fourth start of the season after Neto's groin injury against the Magic on Wednesday forced Snyder to shuffle his starting lineup yet again. O'Neale responded with 17 points, including a career-high five 3-pointers. ""People don't know that Royce is one of the best shooters on the team,"" Mitchell said. ""Tonight was a night where people could see that."" BEASLEY INJURED The injury bug continues to bite the Lakers. Beasley hurt his right hand when he fouled O'Neale with 4:27 left in the fourth quarter. Rookie center Moritz Wagner replaced him. Walton said the veteran forward will get X-rays. BOOM Mitchell's big night included a hard right-handed jam over McGee with about three minutes left in the second quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: James did not travel to Utah. ... Kuzma went 0 of 8 from the field in the first half and shot just 4 of 18 (.222) from the floor overall. ... Ingram scored just three points over the final three quarters. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Almost everything went right for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. Jusuf Nurkic fell just short of a triple-double while resting for much of the fourth quarter of Portland's 127-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The 7-foot Nurkic had 11 points, 11 rebounds and tied career highs with eight assists and six blocks. While star guards CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard stayed on the bench for the final period, coach Terry Stotts left Nurkic in for a couple of minutes. When he remained stuck on eight assists, Nurkic was subbed out. ""If it's not happening right away I'm not going to chase it,"" he said. Stotts said he didn't want to throw off the second unit too much down the stretch. ""I told him I'd give him two minutes,"" Stotts joked. McCollum had 30 points, including five 3-pointers, and Lillard scored 20 before taking the final period off. Lillard had a career-high four blocked shots and the Blazers finished with a season-high 16, one short of the franchise record. Portland has now won four straight and six of seven overall. It improved to 17-7 at home, tied for best in the Western Conference. The victory also extended the Blazers' winning streak over the Hornets in Portland to 11 straight games. Charlotte hasn't won in Portland since 2008. Kemba Walker had 18 points for the Hornets, who fell to 5-14 on the road this season in the fourth of a five-game trip. ""We've got to try to not let this thing keep going in the wrong direction,"" Walker said. ""We've got to stick together and as best as we can we've got to stay positive."" Portland also got another solid performance from its reserves. Seth Curry's 3-pointer extended Portland's lead to 50-36. Jake Layman's alley-oop dunk from Lillard put the Blazers up 61-42. Portland's backups have accounted for at least 50 points in six games this season, all Blazers wins. They had 48 points against the Hornets, but got extra work because the starters were rested. The Blazers led 70-49 at the break and extended the lead to as many as 35 points in the third quarter. ""We just didn't compete tonight defensively. Overall we just did not compete,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""Too soft on the ball, too soft on the interior. They did whatever they wanted to us offensively."" The Blazers were without forward Maurice Harkless for the second straight game because of left knee soreness. There was no word on how long he'll be out. On a tear lately, Nurkic averaged 21.4 points and 11.4 rebounds over the previous eight games. On Friday he became just the third NBA player with at least 11 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and six blocks in fewer than 30 minutes. ""The big fella's been awesome,"" McCollum said. ""He's playing extremely well, he's confident. He's finishing around the basket. But what I like most about him is that he's being aggressive on both ends. Defensively he's protecting the rim for us and being selfish on the offensive end and distributing the ball."" HEADING OUT It was the last of a five-game homestand for the Blazers, who visit Western Conference-leading Denver on Sunday. The Nuggets beat the Blazers in their first meeting this season. ""They came here and they got one,"" Lillard said. ""We had a shot at the end of the game to beat them and we didn't feel like we played that well. So we've just got to take this brand of basketball that we've been playing over the last few games and take it to their court and go get another win."" TIP-INS Hornets: F Nicolas Batum played in Portland for seven seasons. ... Portland's 70 points at the half were the most for a Hornets opponent this season. Trail Blazers: McCollum got into the campaign to get Lillard to the All-Star game with a video where he re-creates the final dance scene from the movie ""Napoleon Dynamite."" The video, released on social media on Thursday, was shown on the scoreboard during the first quarter.","401071304"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry joined some elite company on a list that he figures to top in the not-so-distant future. Curry made five 3-pointers to move into third place all-time in NBA history behind Ray Allen and Reggie Miller, and the Golden State Warriors rolled past the Chicago Bulls 146-109 on Friday night in their most lopsided win of the season. Curry moved past Jason Terry with back-to-back 3s early in the third quarter and ended a 28-point night with 2,285 3-pointers in his career, trailing only Allen (2,973) and Miller (2,560). Curry saved the game ball and hopes to get it autographed by Allen and Miller, players he called trendsetters when it comes to long-range shooting. ""Obviously I want to catch them and put together many more years at this pace,"" Curry said. ""But just knowing that those two guys are right in front of me, for sure. I respect the game and I respect what guys have done before and those two guys are guys I've looked up to."" Curry already holds the single-season record of 402 made 3s in 2015-16 and has moved into third place despite playing in more than 600 fewer games than Allen and Miller. It figures to be only a matter of time before the 30-year-old Curry surpasses those two and takes the mark to a whole new level. ""We all know he's going to break the record,"" teammate Kevin Durant said. ""He sets such a high standard and a high bar. It is cool, but he has another season or two until he gets to the No. 1 spot and then he'll shatter that record, so I'll wait for that."" Curry wasn't even the most dangerous long-range shooter on his own team in this game as Klay Thompson picked up where he left off on his record-setting night in Chicago earlier this season by making seven more 3-pointers and scoring 30 points. Thompson set an NBA mark in the first meeting between the teams on Oct. 29 by hitting 14 3-pointers as part of a 52-point night while playing only the first three quarters. He made three from long range in the first 70 seconds of the rematch and the rout was on. ""That was incredible,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Unbelievable start for him. It was a great first quarter, obviously set the tone."" The Warriors took a double-digit lead after just 2:19 and the Bulls never got the game back within single digits. Jonas Jerebko banked in a 3-pointer from beyond half court at the end of the first quarter to give Golden State a 43-17 lead that grew to 44 points in the third quarter. Durant added 22 for the Warriors, his 15th straight game with at least 20 points. Zach LaVine scored 29 points to lead the Bulls, who couldn't overcome the poor start and lost their sixth straight game. ""I don't know if we were watching them, in awe fearful,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""I don't know what it was. We talked about it and I thought we came out in the second quarter and played better. We did respond. But we were just following them around to start the game and that was a little bit too respectful. I am disappointed in that."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had its largest first-quarter deficit in franchise history. ... The Bulls allowed 18 3-pointers and made only nine. They have given up 103 more 3-pointers than they've made this season, the worst differential in the league. ... G Kris Dunn finished with a minus-45 rating. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Blake Griffin kept his emotions to himself in his return to Staples Center for the first time against his old team. After scoring 44 points in the Detroit Pistons' 109-104 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, he allowed himself a trip down memory lane. ""The best thing to be a part of is something that is bigger than yourself and that is what that was,"" he said in a crowded hallway outside the Pistons' locker room. ""I don't look at what I did."" Griffin was greeted with cheers during pregame introductions and received a standing ovation after a first-quarter video tribute from the team that drafted him first overall in 2009. ""There was a lot of hype coming into this game and I was looking forward to it, but I'm glad that it's over,"" he said. ""The next time I come it won't be as crazy."" Griffin stuck his right arm in the air and then brought his raised hands together in a thankful gesture without smiling. He clearly wanted to beat the team that stunningly traded him last January after he had signed a $171 million, five-year extension. It showed from the start. Griffin scored 15 points in the opening quarter when he got razzed by superfan Clipper Darrell during free throw attempts. He had 26 points in the first half to help Detroit to a 65-54 lead. ""Hey Blake, we miss you but enough for tonight, OK?"" a Clippers fan implored. Griffin wasn't done. His 3-pointer to start the third and a basket by Andre Drummond pushed Detroit to a 16-point lead. Griffin had a one-hand slam reminiscent of his old Lob City days. ""He played great,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Griffin left the court near the end of the third because of back spasms and returned briefly wearing a hot wrap. The Clippers tied it at 97 on a 3-pointer by Lou Williams after outscoring the Pistons 17-7 to open the fourth. Reggie Bullock had two 3-pointers around Drummond's dunk and Griffin's hook for a 107-99 lead. ""We're really happy to get the win for Blake,"" Bullock said. The Clippers got within three and Griffin missed two 3-pointers in the closing seconds. He stepped out of bounds in the corner of the baseline while trying to save a pass and fell backward, crashing into fans and the floor. Bruce Brown stole the ball with 20 seconds left, got fouled by Danilo Gallinari and made both to keep Detroit ahead 109-104. Gallinari's jumper missed in the waning seconds. ""Down the stretch we played great defense, got stops and protected the ball and that was the difference,"" Griffin said. ""The Clippers are a tough team. They had three guys who come off the bench on the floor at the end of the game. It was a well-balanced and great win for us."" Drummond had 20 points and 21 rebounds for the Pistons, who had lost nine of 11. Bullock finished with 17. Gallinari led the Clippers with 23 points. Williams added 22 points, and Harrell had 21 points and nine rebounds. Griffin averaged 21.6 points, 9.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists in eight seasons for the Clippers. He was the Rookie of the Year and a five-time All-Star with the franchise. Rivers said he and Griffin haven't spoken since the trade. ""That's a love lost there those two got to work out,"" Harrell said. However, Rivers credited Griffin for the franchise's resurgence. ""Blake got this started,"" Rivers said before the game. ""Six playoffs in a row. It doesn't equate to being the winner because we didn't do that but it equates to winning. Blake was part of that. Now when you hear our name you don't think of those bad Clippers before Blake."" TIP-INS Pistons: Taylor Griffin was on babysitting duty, bringing his younger brother's son, Ford, to the locker room after the game. ...

Clippers: They lost their first game against Griffin's Pistons in Detroit within days of last year's trade. Griffin had 19 points in that game. NO LOVE LOST Clippers owner Steve Ballmer waited on the sideline for Griffin to finish his early warmups. Griffin began walking off court as Ballmer stuck out his right hand to shake. Griffin took off running into the tunnel. Ballmer threw up his hands and walked away. ""As soon as I'm done doing my pregame shooting I make sure there's a path and I take off running to the locker room and I don't stop running,"" Griffin said afterward. ""I don't change that for anybody."" Asked if he would have shaken hands with Ballmer, Griffin said, ""I'm not here to answer hypothetical questions."" HE SAID IT ""The West is tough every night and when you lose to an East Coast team it hurts even more."" -- Rivers.","401071306"
"MIAMI --  Shelvin Mack drove on Dwyane Wade, with the game on the line. Mack's layup attempt never got near the rim. Only a few days shy of his 37th birthday, Wade can still block shots -- even in the biggest moments of a game. Justise Winslow scored 26 points, Wade delivered the block and won the ensuing jump ball with 4 seconds left, and the Miami Heat beat the Memphis Grizzlies 112-108 on Saturday night. ""If he would have won that jump ball, I would have been highly disappointed in myself,"" said Wade, whose birthday is Thursday. ""I was very confident going into that jump ball that I could muster up just enough to get it."" He had just enough. Wade tapped the crucial jump to Josh Richardson, who made a pair of free throws to seal it for Miami with 1.1 seconds left. Richardson and Tyler Johnson each scored 14 for the Heat, who hit midseason at 21-20. Bam Adebayo and Derrick Jones Jr. scored 11 apiece, and Wade finished with 10 as the Heat survived despite wasting a 13-point lead midway through the third quarter. ""It's not always going to be pretty for us,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. JaMychal Green scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who went 0-2 this season against Miami -- losing the two games by a total of seven points. Mike Conley scored 22 and Marc Gasol had 15 for the Grizzlies. Conley banked in a 65-footer as time expired, though it was waved off and would have been irrelevant anyway. ""We still had an opportunity down the stretch,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""They just made a couple more plays than we did."" No lead was safe: Memphis blew a pair of double-digit leads in the first half, and Miami was up by 13 midway through the third before finding itself scratching and clawing at the end. Conley's 3-pointer with 6:31 left knotted the game at 99, ending a 12-minute stretch where the Grizzlies outscored the Heat 32-19. It was tied twice more after that as well, but the Grizzles never reclaimed the lead. Conley tried a runner for the lead with 56 seconds left, and Gasol had a wide-open 3-point try as the shot clock was running down with 32 seconds remaining. Both missed -- Conley's bounced off and Gasol's missed everything, going wide left. With Miami up one, Wade missed a jumper with 14 seconds left and Richardson grabbed the rebound for Miami before getting fouled. He made one of two free throws, and Memphis called time with 9 seconds left. That brought on the play where Mack tried to drive on Wade, to no avail. ""It just came down to getting stops at the end,"" Green said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis opened on a 19-7 run, then had a 17-4 run later in the half -- yet still went into the break down 63-61. ... It was the first game at Miami for Joakim Noah since Dec. 6, 2016. ... During the game, Justin Timberlake tweeted out a video showing him making half-court shots on the Grizzlies' practice court in Memphis. He had a concert in their building Saturday night. ... Mack and Jaren Jackson each had 13 points for Memphis. Heat: It was kids' day at the Heat game, and Spoelstra got into the act by holding his 9-month-old son Santiago as he stood for the national anthem. ""One of the coolest things I've experienced,"" Spoelstra said. ... Hassan Whiteside (ill) missed the game. ... Miami made 15 3-pointers, and has 33 in its last two games. CHASING MICHAEL Wade now has 865 blocked shots, 28 away from matching Michael Jordan's career record for a guard. Add in playoffs, and Wade has 1,040 -- 11 shy of Jordan's record. ANDERSON HURT Memphis lost starting forward Kyle Anderson to a sprained left ankle in the first half. X-rays were negative, and Bickerstaff said he will have an MRI on Sunday. DAUNTING SCHEDULE Miami plays only four home games in the next six weeks -- and three of those are in a four-day span between Jan. 30 and Feb. 2. After that, the next Heat home game is Feb. 23. In all, 12 of Miami's next 16 are on the road and 11 of those games are against likely playoff teams. TURKEY TURNAROUND At Thanksgiving, Memphis was 12-5 and leading the Western Conference.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Boston Celtics couldn't cool down Terrence Ross in the second half and it cost them the game. Aaron Gordon had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and the Orlando Magic held off a late rally to beat the Celtics 105-103 on Saturday night. Ross added 25 points, 18 in the second half, and Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he was the difference. ""Terrence Ross changed the whole game,"" Stevens said. ""When a guy catches fire, you've got to slow him down. We didn't get into his air space good enough and when we did, we fouled. When Ross got going it opened everything up."" Jayson Tatum missed a jumper at the buzzer that would have tied it for the Celtics, who charged back from a nine-point deficit in the final 1:43 before losing to the Magic for the second time this season. Kyrie Irving scored 25 points for the Celtics, 10 of them from the foul line in the final 4:31. He appeared frustrated afterward with Gordon Hayward, who inbounded the ball on Boston's final possession. ""Next question,"" Irving said when asked about his reaction. ""J.T. got a good look so let's move on."" Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 13 rebounds for Orlando, which broke a four-game losing streak. He missed the second of two free throws with 3.2 seconds, leaving the Celtics with a chance to win or tie. Tatum took the inbounds pass and missed a 21-footer. ""Any time you have a shot to win at the end, that's all anybody focuses on,"" Stevens said. ""That stretch at the end of the third and early fourth is what really gave them the momentum."" Boston fell behind 29-21 early in the second quarter after going 5 minutes, 45 seconds between field goals. But Jaylen Brown hit a couple of 3-pointers, and Tatum and Marcus Smart each hit one as the Celtics took command with a 23-5 run and led 51-41 at halftime. Boston led 61-53 when Tatum went to the bench with four fouls midway through the third quarter. Vucevic and Ross scored nine points apiece in the period and Ross hit a 3-pointer in the final second to help Orlando cut the deficit to five. ""Obviously Terrence was instrumental there. When he gets going he doesn't need a lot of space,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Ross and Gordon then combined for 14 points in a 19-4 fourth-quarter run that regained a seven-point lead for Orlando with 5:57 remaining. ""That was huge,"" said Gordon, who made all 13 of his free throws. ""Hopefully the next time the Celtics come to town we'll have more of a home crowd.""

"MINNEAPOLIS -- With the Minnesota Timberwolves badly needing to win after blowing it the night before and the game hanging in the balance, Karl-Anthony Towns took over. Towns did so against one of his most daunting opponents, too, furthering his place as the franchise leader. With 27 points and a career-high 27 rebounds, the most in the NBA this season, Towns helped the Timberwolves fend off Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans for a 110-106 victory on Saturday night, the first at home for interim head coach Ryan Saunders. ""I just want to be the energy my team needs on a nightly basis,"" Towns said, ""and if they need more I've got to be able to bring it."" Towns swished a top-of-the-key 3-pointer to make it 106-103 with 2:55 left, giving the Timberwolves the lead for good. Then Towns blocked a 3-point try by Davis on the other end, triggering a fast break that Tyus Jones finished with a layup. ""We need him to set the tone for us, and we've got to follow his lead,"" said Jones, who took the final 17 minutes at point guard for the ailing Jeff Teague. Davis had 30 points and 14 rebounds for his 13th consecutive double-double. Jrue Holiday added 25 points and seven assists for the Pelicans, who pulled within 108-106 on Holiday's three-point play with 2:23 remaining. But Towns blocked another 3-point attempt by Davis with 1:37 left that would have put the Pelicans in front, and the Timberwolves took it from there. Jones and Dario Saric each added 14 points on 2-for-3 shooting from 3-point range off the bench to help offset a 7-for-33 performance behind the arc by the rest of the team. The Pelicans shot 20 for 29 from the floor over the final three minutes of the first half through the third quarter to take an 89-87 lead, but they faltered late. ""They were better coached. They played harder. They did everything they had to, to win the game, and we didn't,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""That's the bottom line. We didn't rebound the basketball, we turned it over, and I'm as much to blame as anybody."" This was a critical game for the Wolves, coming off a four-point loss to Dallas here the night before and facing some serious catching up to do in the relentless Western Conference race in order to return to the playoffs. The Mavericks, Pelicans and Wolves all entered the evening tied for 11th place, 2 games below the cut. The Wolves played without second-leading scorer Derrick Rose, who has missed all three games against the Pelicans this season, for precaution on the second of the back-to-back nights because of his return on Friday from a six-game absence to a sprained right ankle. The Pelicans brought a similar urgency, beginning a stretch of five straight road games against Western Conference foes. They had losing streaks of four, five and six straight games over the first half of their schedule, slumps that will loom large down the stretch. ""We can finish this trip 4-1,"" Davis said, adding: ""We've got to come in with a defensive mindset going into the rest of these games, these next four games."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Julius Randle had his 21st double-double of the season, with 22 points and 11 rebounds. ... E'Twaun Moore (bruised left quadriceps) returned from a two-game absence but had only two points on 1-for-6 shooting in 31 minutes. Timberwolves: Teague, who had two points and 10 assists in 21 minutes, aggravated near the end of the first half a left ankle injury that recently kept him out for nine games. ... Rookie Josh Okogie matched his season high with 17 points and played a season-most 42 minutes. BIG BLUE BIG MEN Davis and Towns were both first overall picks in the draft, three years apart from the professional basketball player factory at Kentucky under coach John Calipari. Whether or not Davis and Towns actually play with more intensity against each other is difficult to gauge, but their lines in the box score are almost always full. ""I'm sure Cal uses this as a recruiting tool,"" Gentry said, ""but you're playing against great Kentucky players every night in this league so it's not a big deal to those guys."" Over their first five meetings in Minnesota, Towns averaged 25.2 points and 13.8 rebounds against New Orleans. Davis averaged 30.4 points and 10 rebounds. ""It was a lot of Kentucky on Kentucky crime we had to go through,"" Towns said. DENG SIGHTING Saunders summoned Luol Deng in the second quarter for a spark, and he pitched in five points in five minutes. Over the last two seasons, the 15-year NBA veteran has logged a total of just 50 minutes, but Saunders eagerly greeted him at halfcourt at the first whistle after his corner 3-pointer. ""He gave us a lot of confidence,"" Towns said.","401071309"

""They didn't let me play,"" Aldridge said. ""They doubled me in every way. They came from the baseline, from the top. They made sure that the ball wasn't in my hands. "" The Spurs led 60-51 at halftime behind 12 points from DeRozan and 11 from Belinelli. The Thunder fought back in the third quarter. George hit a 3-pointer to give the Thunder a 64-63 lead. Schroder's layup at the third-quarter buzzer put the Thunder up 86-80. Oklahoma City outscored the Spurs 35-20 in the period. ""Third quarter was a tough quarter,"" Popovich said. ""Put ourselves behind the 8-ball there. Played a great first half on the road after an emotional game. I was really happy with their effort and mental approach to the game."" Schroder's layup gave the Thunder a 96-87 lead and caused San Antonio to call a timeout, but the onslaught continued. Schroder stole the ball, then bounced a pass between his legs and behind him to a trailing Westbrook, whose layup put the Thunder ahead 112-100 with about 5 minutes to play. TIP-INS Spurs: DeRozan was called for a technical in the third quarter. ... The Spurs went 16 for 19 from 3-point range on Thursday, but 10 for 31 on Saturday. ... The Spurs outrebounded the Thunder 52-47. Thunder: G Alex Abrines missed his seventh straight game for personal reasons. ... Schroder was called for a technical in the third quarter. ..

STAT LINES The Spurs had six turnovers in the third quarter and 14 overall. The Thunder had seven turnovers the entire game. PERFECT NADER Thunder forward Abdel Nader, in his second year out of Iowa State, has provided a major boost off the bench lately.

"PHOENIX --  The Denver Nuggets have the best record in the Western Conference; the Phoenix Suns have the worst. On top of that, the Suns were without scoring leader Devin Booker. But the mismatch that was supposed to happen Saturday night never did. Quite the opposite, as the Suns took the lead in the first quarter and never faltered in a 102-93 victory. ""That team outplayed us tonight,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""They played harder than us tonight, and it was apparent throughout the game."" Kelly Oubre Jr. matched his career high with 26 points and tied his career best with 11 rebounds for Phoenix. Deandre Ayton added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Suns, who have won two of three with Booker sidelined with back spasms. ""We were the aggressors today,"" Ayton said. ""That's the main part of it."" Nikola Jokic had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Nuggets. Malik Beasley scored 20 points. ""I think we just thought it was going to be easy,"" Jokic said. ""...I think we played their record, not their personnel. Those guys are playing hard right now."" Denver fell to just a half-game ahead of Golden State for best record in the West. It might have been Phoenix's best defensive effort of the season. ""What impressed me the most is just how long we did it,"" the Suns' Josh Jackson said. ""We did it for literally the whole game. Like, I can't remember one point in time when I looked up and I felt like we were playing bad defense."" Coach Igor Kokoskov said it's one thing to have a good game plan, and another to execute it. ""From the game plan, to the film, to the court, there's a long, long way,"" he said. ""Players play the game and win a game, so that's what it is. We showed up and played well."" The Suns took the lead for good late in the first quarter and were up by as many as 16 in the second and 18 in the third. Denver never got closer than seven points in the fourth quarter. Troy Daniels and Oubre sank 3s in a 10-0 Phoenix run late in the first quarter to put the Suns up for good 30-20. The run reached 19-6 when Elie Okobo's two free throws made it 39-26 with 9:38 left in the half. Oubre's 3-pointer with 3:55 lead left gave Phoenix its biggest lead of the half, 55-39, and the Suns led at the break 60-47. Phoenix took its biggest lead at 68-50 early in the third quarter before Denver rallied to get to single digits. Jokic made one of two free throws to cut it to 74-66 with 2:57 left in the third but Oubre banked in a 3 at the third-quarter buzzer to put the Suns up 81-69 entering the fourth. Okobo opened the final quarter with a 20-footer and T.J. Warren's 3-pointer put the Suns ahead 91-76 with 7:13 to play. A 9-0 run, capped by Jamal Murray's 3-pointer, cut the Phoenix lead to 93-86 with 4:24 left. But Richaun Holmes made a short jumper in the lane and De'Anthony Melton sank two from the foul line to boost it to 97-86 with 3:11 remaining. The Nuggets never got closer than eight after that. Denver shot 39 percent and committed 17 turnovers, resulting in 26 Suns points. TIP-INS Nuggets: Will Barton, out since Oct. 20 after undergoing hip and core muscle surgery, played 16 minutes, scoring six points on 2-of-10 shooting. ...

OUBRE'S ROLLING Oubre, who also scored 26 in the Suns' win over Sacramento on Tuesday night, came to Phoenix last month in the trade that sent Trevor Ariza to Washington. He's made a quick impact with his energy, quickness and scoring, and quickly became a fan favorite. ""I'm just trying to get better as the team gets better,"" he said. ""I'm still trying to get acclimated within the system. But obviously I'm a player, too. I'm a really good player and I just try to go out there and play within the system.""","401071311"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell relishes a challenge. ""When the odds are stacked against us, with our backs up against the wall, that's when we play our best,"" said Mitchell, who filled in at point guard again as Utah is still missing its top three at that position. Mitchell scored 34 points, his third straight game with more than 30, to help the Jazz pull away from the Chicago Bulls 110-102 on Saturday night. After struggling with his shot in the first few months of the season, the second-year guard has started making defenses pay for going under screens, but more than that he's making quicker reads and making the most potent play. ""If you start missing shots and then you just stop taking them, then the defense wins. We just continue to take good shots,"" said Mitchell, who had 11 points in the fourth quarter. The Bulls trailed only 97-92 before Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles hit back-to-back 3-pointers to make it 105-92 with 2:23 remaining. Ingles, who had 16 points, then waved goodbye as he backpedaled down the court, clinching Utah's fifth win in its last six games. Zach LaVine scored 21 points and Lauri Markkanen added 16 for the Bulls, who dropped their seventh straight. ""I think they made adjustments,"" LaVine said. ""Donovan did a good job of hitting some big-time shots. I think they got a lot of timely plays."" The Jazz played their second game without their top three point guards: Ricky Rubio, Dante Exum and Raul Neto. But that might only make Mitchell more effective as he has the ball in his hands more. He had six assists. ""He's given himself permission to attack,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""He felt like he could bust through and use his explosiveness ... he's done a really good job at that in transition on missed baskets and steals."" Rudy Gobert scored 15 points, grabbed 16 rebounds and had a career-high eight assists as the Bulls collapsed on the big Frenchman and didn't allow him rolls to the hoop. Kyle Korver scored 16 points and passed Jason Terry to move into fourth place in NBA history with 2,284 3-pointers. Ray Allen, Reggie Miller and Stephen Curry top the list. ""It means a lot. I'm grateful and I'm going to keep on shooting,"" Korver said. Mitchell's recent tear has corresponded with the Jazz finally rising above .500 and replicating last season's remarkable second-half success as their schedule finally softened. ""We don't have a point guard right now but Donovan's filling in great,"" Korver said. ""So to grind out a win on a back-to-back is really good for our team."" The Bulls pressured the Jazz defensively and drove the lane on Gobert without fear after losing 146-109 to Golden State on Friday. Unlike past losses when the Bulls' effort could be questioned, Chicago played hard but shots stopped falling midway through the final quarter. ""We talked about courage before the game after that difficult loss,"" Chicago coach Jim Boylen said. ""We battled from down 13. We didn't fold. We competed."" The Bulls outscored the Jazz 54-32 in the paint as they tried again and again to get to the rim and ceded 3-point attempts on the other end, consistently going under every screen. Utah led 31-19 before Jabari Parker, who had only played one of the last 13 games, spurred a 16-2 run with seven points to give the Bulls a 35-33 edge. Chicago held the Jazz to 35 percent shooting and led at halftime 53-51. TIP-INS Bulls: Several media outlets reported that Boylen has restructured his deal, which will result in a pay increase and a partial guarantee for next season. ... Robin Lopez and Wendell Carter each had technical fouls in the second half. ... Six Bulls scored in double figures. Jazz: Jae Crowder went 1 for 13, continuing a slump that has him shooting 21 percent over his last five games. ... The Jazz also were playing a back-to-back set but both were at home. ... O'Neale tied a career high with 11 rebounds. SNYDER NOTCHES 200th WIN The Jazz players have never been shy about their respect for Snyder, who celebrated his 200th win with the Jazz. Since becoming the coach in 2014, he is 200-174. ""He's one of the best coaches in the NBA, not just as a coach but as a person and I think that's what attracts us to him so much,"" Mitchell said. ""I wouldn't want to play for anybody else."" Ingles added, ""What Coach brings is passion for us getting better ... he's the best coach I've played for, by far. He gives us so much confidence to go out there and do what we need to do.""","401071312"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Sacramento Kings usually try to run past opponents or win games from behind the 3-point line. They are also learning they can triumph by playing solid defense and limiting their mistakes on offense. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 22 points, Willie Cauley-Stein had his second straight double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds, and the Kings beat the road-weary Charlotte Hornets 104-97 on Saturday night. The Kings, who committed just 11 turnovers compared to 20 by Charlotte, are 7-0 this season when holding an opponent below 100 points. Earlier this week, Sacramento had 26 turnovers in a loss at Phoenix. ""This was kind of a gritty win. We stuck together, kept competing defensively and got stops,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""A good win for us."" De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield each scored 21 points for the Kings, who improved to 10-3 against Eastern Conference teams. The Hornets fell to 2-11 against teams from the West. Kemba Walker had 31 points despite going 3 for 12 on 3-pointers for the Hornets, who have lost three straight and five of six. Charlotte is 5-15 away from home this season, and is 1-4 on a trip that ends Monday at San Antonio. The Hornets did a good job of slowing down the Kings, holding them to four fast-break points, but Sacramento hit crucial shots in the fourth quarter every time Charlotte tried to make a run. ""Just a lot of mistakes. We made a lot of mistakes down the stretch defensively, and they made plays,"" Walker said. ""That's really what it was. We came out with some great energy tonight. We were really conscious of that. We haven't been playing with that kind of energy as of late."" Walker had 14 points in the first half and Charlotte led 59-57 entering the third period. The Kings held an 82-76 lead at the start of the fourth quarter. Charlotte opened the final period with four straight points to pull within a bucket, but Bogdanovic had five points in a 10-0 run to give the Kings a 92-80 lead. Walker responded with six straight points to start a 9-0 Charlotte run that brought the Hornets back within three points, yet they could get no closer as Hield scored eight late points and the Kings extended their lead. ""We got stops when we needed to get stops, and that's what ultimately brought us out on top,"" Fox said. ""They made a run at the end, but we were able to get the stops when we needed them.""

"NEW YORK --  Ben Simmons backed up his tough talk with a big day. Simmons had 20 points, 22 rebounds and nine assists, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the New York Knicks 108-105 on Sunday. Joel Embiid scored 26 points for the Sixers, who were coming off a 123-121 home loss against Atlanta on Friday night. JJ Redick added 22 points, and Jimmy Butler finished with 16. Simmons called his team ""too soft"" after the loss to the lowly Hawks. He answered his own challenge with a pair of big plays late in the fourth quarter against New York. The Knicks pulled within two on rookie Kevin Knox's 3-pointer with 3:02 left, but Simmons pulled down an offensive rebound and fed Redick for a key jumper. A defensive rebound for Simmons set up Redick's two foul shots with 20 seconds left, lifting Philadelphia to a 106-98 lead. ""I thought especially the offensive rebound at the end of the game that led to JJ's 3, I thought that was the game,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""They made it close at the end, but I thought his overall performance was dominant."" New York's Emmanuel Mudiay missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer at the buzzer. Knox had career-high 31 points for the Knicks, who have lost four straight and 19 of 22. Luke Kornet had a career-best 23 points. At 19 years, 155 days, Knox became the sixth-youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points in a game, joining Kobe Bryant, Devin Booker, Jaren Jackson Jr., Kevin Durant and LeBron James. ""Those are some legendary players,"" Knox said. ""There's a lot of other players on that list, but it just shows the work (I'm) putting in is paying off. Those are some great guys (to share) company with."" New York trailed by as many as 24 points in the second quarter, but closed to 83-82 on Kornet's basket with 11 seconds left in the third. The 76ers responded in the fourth, beginning the quarter with an 11-0 run. Simmons capped the spurt by finding a driving Butler for a layup that made it 94-82 with 6:22 left. ""We have to lock down on defense and offensively take care of the ball,"" Simmons said. ""I think that's really it. Everybody needs to be locked in."" HOME SWEET HOME?

"During a break-time promo, kids partake in the Wizards' ""parking challenge"" and one of the competitors goes rogue. (0:48) WASHINGTON --  The Toronto Raptors began with a rush. They scored the first nine points against the Washington Wizards, built a 19-point lead in the first quarter and went ahead by 23 in the second quarter. Near the end of the third quarter, Toronto still led by 17 points. Then Washington got hot and forced one overtime and then another. Serge Ibaka's 3-pointer with 15 seconds left in the second overtime allowed the Raptors to survive and earn their fifth straight win, 140-138 over the Wizards on Sunday. ""It shouldn't come down to the last possession,"" Kawhi Leonard said. ""We need to close out games better."" Leonard, who played a season-high 45 minutes, led Toronto with 41 points and 11 rebounds. ""Tonight he played like a superstar,"" Ibaka said. ""That's how we need him to play and he did his job as a superstar. When we need him to step up and make big plays, he did them for us."" Bradley Beal had his second triple-double of the season, collecting season highs of 43 points and 15 assists along with 10 rebounds. His 3-pointer with 20.4 seconds left in regulation tied it at 124 to force overtime. His jumper with 6.8 seconds to play in the first overtime tied it at 131. Beal joined Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history with multiple games of 40 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in a season. Robertson had three such games in 1961-62. He didn't have much to say about it, though, leaving the locker room before it opened to the media as the Wizards scrambled to make a flight to London for its next game. Washington never led until early in the second overtime. Leonard had 13 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtime. Toronto missed seven of nine from the field in the second OT and didn't score for nearly 3 1/2 minutes, but Washington could only push ahead by three points during that stretch. ""We got lucky to get out of here with a win,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. Pascal Siakim scored 24 and had a career-high 19 rebounds for the Raptors.

Antetokounmpo scored 33 points, Eric Bledsoe added 24 points and 10 assists, and Milwaukee beat the Hawks 133-114 on Sunday in Mike Budenholzer's return to Atlanta. Middleton finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds to help the Bucks improve to 30-12, second-best in the NBA. Coming off a loss at Washington that Antetokounmpo missed with injuries, Milwaukee is 12-0 following a defeat and remained the league's only team not to drop consecutive games. Budenholzer, making his first appearance at State Farm Arena since leaving the Hawks after last season, wished his former team well as it rebuilds with youngsters John Collins, Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and Omari Spellman. ""It's good to come back and see some familiar faces where you worked for five years,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think to check that box and for the team to play well and execute is good. We'll move on."" The Bucks are soaring, thanks mostly to the 6-foot-11, 242-pound Antetokounmpo, who scored 14 on free throws and had two dazzling assists early in the fourth. He first smothered Trae Young to steal the ball and feed George Hill for a 3-pointer that made it 104-90, before adding a no-look drop pass on D.J. Wilson's layup for a 16-point lead. He later hit a couple of jumpers to make it a 15-point advantage. Milwaukee has won 12 of 15 dating to Dec. 14. The Bucks began the day outscoring opponents by an NBA-leading 9.1 points per game.

NO REGRETS Budenholzer said ""change and moving is part of life"" when asked before the game about leaving the Hawks. Calling it ""a heck of a five years,"" Budenholzer wasn't looking back with animosity following a 24-58 finish last season. He was the NBA Coach of the Year in his second season, leading Atlanta to 60 wins and its first appearance in the Eastern Conference finals. When principal owner Tony Ressler bought the team and Danny Ferry was out as general manager, Budenholzer added president of basketball operations to his title, but the Hawks made three bad moves that set the organization back and precipitated the rebuild. Al Horford and Paul Millsap, two model team leaders, left as free agents after the Hawks decided not to trade them. In between those gaffes, the team signed mercurial center Dwight Howard to a three-year, $70.5 million contract and dealt him away after one ill-fit season. Budenholzer said he loves his job with the Bucks and wishes the Hawks well. ""A rebuild -- it's a tough job to be the owner in a rebuild, to be a GM to be a coach. These are tough jobs, and so I don't know who the right coach is,"" he said. ""And I think they feel great about where they are and that's important for them.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic threw about everything they had at Houston's James Harden and the strategy worked. Barely. Orlando rallied in the fourth quarter to squeeze out a 116-109 win over Houston on Sunday behind 22 points apiece from Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon, and 17 points from Evan Fournier. The Magic outscored Harden and Houston 14-4 in the final four minutes of the game to win their second straight game. ""That was exhausting,"" said Fournier, who spent most of the game chasing Harden around pick-and-rolls. ""The guy is terrific. I thought overall, we did a pretty good job, but the guy still had 38."" Harden scored 38 points to push his run of 30-point games to 16, but at a high price. Harden was just 1 for 17 on 3-point attempts. He did get fouled three times shooting from beyond the arc and was 9 for 9 from the free throw line on those occasions (15 of 16 overall), but it was never enough to give the Rockets a comfortable advantage. ""I thought we did well against him, except for the fouls,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""It's not easy to guard him without fouling and yet it's necessary, but he also was 11 for 32, 1 for 17 and we didn't make a lot of mistakes, except that."" Houston led much of the game and was up 105-98 when Harden made a pair of free throws with 4:34 left. From there, however, he was 1 for 5 from the field, including three misses on step-back 3-pointers. His teammates were 0 for 3 during that span, giving him no help when the game was being decided. ""The problem is you can't rely on (Harden) to be super human every night,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We have to have some contribution from other guys. I thought they came in with a lack of focus on the defensive end and it carried over on the offensive end. We didn't play well."" Harden agreed with his coach. ""We scored enough points to win,"" Harden said. ""We didn't have our focus defensively, like we have the last few weeks. We gave them 70 points or something in the second half (actually, 64). You give a team like this some confidence and open shots and they made them. It's pretty simple."" Austin Rivers scored 25 points and Clint Capela 17 points and 10 rebounds for Houston, which lost for only the fourth time in its last 17 games. Terrence Ross had 17 points for Orlando, including six straight in the late-game run when the Magic put away Houston. With Harden on the bench for a brief rest, the Rockets used a 10-2 run to start the fourth period and grab a 98-88 lead, but the Magic passed them when Ross followed a three-point play with a 3-pointer to make it 106-105 with 3:11 left. Fournier and D.J. Augustin followed with back-to-back 3-pointers and Vucevic hit a short jump hook that finished the run that sealed the game.

"DALLAS --  A day after the Dallas Mavericks got the bad news that backup point guard and team sparkplug J.J. Barea was lost for the season, Stephen Curry brought more bad news -- in the form of 11 3-pointers. Curry scored 48 points and tied his season high for 3s in a game as the Golden State Warriors held off the Mavericks 119-114 on Sunday night. ""We just couldn't get Curry under control,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He was brilliant tonight."" Curry's 11 3s were the most ever by a Mavericks opponent. The last one was his most important, snapping a 114-all tie with 42 seconds to play. Both Curry and Warriors coach Steve Kerr credited Kevin Durant for switching play calls to get Curry shots rather than taking shots of his own. ""That was just (Durant) taking the initiative, knowing that I had a hot hand going,"" Curry said. ""Call it a decoy in terms of him being in the action, but allowing me to work. The way they were defending us, it just made sense tonight."" Durant added 28 points for the Warriors, and Klay Thompson had nine of his 16 in the fourth quarter as the Warriors received a tough test from a Dallas team playing without its top two point guards, Dennis Smith Jr. and Barea. Luka Doncic scored 26 points for Dallas and Harrison Barnes had 22. Jalen Brunson had 12 off the bench in 30 minutes, in place of the injured point guards. After Curry's shot, Draymond Green blocked Brunson's drive at the other end and secured the loose ball. The Mavericks forced a miss, but Barnes turned the ball over in the frontcourt with 5 seconds left. Curry sealed the game with free throws. ""He had mismatches,"" Durant said. ""He was making shots over everybody tonight, so why run plays? Just give him the ball."" Dallas missed its final eight shots from the field. ""You always can get better shots,"" Doncic said. ""We were in the bonus so we wanted to drive the ball. Today wasn't the day."" Devin Harris gave Dallas its first lead since the second quarter with a driving layup to make it 105-103 with 5:29 remaining. Harris followed that with a 3 for a five-point lead, capping an 11-0 run. Curry tied it at 114 with a floater in the lane with 1:39 to play, and Doncic missed a 3 at the other end, setting up Curry's winner. BAREA TO HAVE SURGERY MONDAY Carlisle said Barea would have surgery Monday to repair his ruptured right Achilles tendon. Barea suffered the injury in the fourth quarter Friday night against Minnesota and is out for the season. Barea was averaging nearly 11 points and six assists per game. Barea's teammate Wesley Matthews suffered the same injury in March 2015 while playing for Portland. Matthews signed with Dallas that offseason and returned to the NBA early in the 2015-16 season. ""I told him there's not going to be a slogan or a catchphrase that's going to make it go away,"" Matthews said. ""You're going to have to take your time. You're going to have to do your due diligence. Attack it every single day."" TIP-INS Warriors: Curry finished three points short of his season high. ... Golden State is now 11-1 all-time when Curry hits 10 or more 3s. Mavericks: Curry's 19 3-point attempts was also the most all-time by a Dallas opponent. . Smith missed his third straight game with back tightness. . Carlisle received a technical foul with 49 seconds left in the second quarter, courtesy of referee Ed Malloy following the coach's animated response to a non-call on a play Carlisle thought was a Warriors foul.","401071318"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic wanted to set an example for his teammates with high-energy, physical play. He did that and much more. Jokic scored a season-high 40 points, Jamal Murray fought through a bloody lip to add 24 and the Denver Nuggets beat the Portland Trail Blazers 116-113 on Sunday night. ""He was really aggressive from the jump,"" Murray said of Jokic. ""Whether it was Nurk (Jusuf Nurkic, Al-Farouq) Aminu, whoever was on him, he was going at them and they had no answer for him. He just kept scoring and took over the load for a while. We need those nights from him. So it was a huge, great night, but that's not going to be his only 40-point performance."" Jokic, who was serenaded at times with chants of ""MVP!"" from the crowd, said he sensed during pregame warmups that the team was a little flat and he determined he should go out and play aggressively to help set the tone for his teammates. ""I thought during warmups we were kind of loose and not focused, so I tried to pick up the energy,"" Jokic said. Jokic finished a point off his career high. He added 10 rebounds and eight assists, just missing his sixth triple-double of the season. ""Jokic is a hell of a player,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""He is a difficult guy to guard. He scores inside, scores outside and he passes. We didn't do a very good job with him tonight, no matter who was on him."" Murray's lip was bloodied when he took an elbow to the mouth from Nurkic on a drive to the basket early in the third quarter. Murray hit both free throws before heading to the locker room. He was back in the game within minutes, and grabbed a rebound off his own missed shot in the final moments, hitting both free throws after he was fouled. ""It wouldn't stop bleeding, obviously being warm and being in the game,"" Murray said. ""They just put some Vaseline on it but it was a task to stay on it."" Denver rebounded from a loss at Phoenix on Saturday night for its 12th home win in a row. Damian Lillard led Portland with 26 points, and CJ McCollum had 18 points. The Trail Blazers had won four straight. Lillard put in a reverse layup to put the Trail Blazers up by two with 5:48 remaining in the third quarter. But the Nuggets closed the period on a 17-10 run to take a 93-88 lead into the fourth. Jokic had 15 points in the period, including two 3-pointers during the Nuggets' surge and also added an assist on an alley-oop pass that Mason Plumlee finished with a one-handed dunk. Portland, though, scored the first six points of the fourth, moving in front by a point on Evan Turner's jumper. It was tied at 108 when Jokic hit a floater in the lane to put the Nuggets on top with 1:07 left to play. He added a pair of free throws moments later only to see Lillard drive to the basket for a dunk. With 30.6 seconds, Murray hit a jumper, but McCollum connected on 3-pointer to pull Portland within one with 27.7 seconds left. Denver ran the clock down and Murray let a jumper fly that hit the back of the rim and bounced out. Murray grabbed the rebound, was fouled and made both free throws with 3 seconds left. Portland had just enough time for a long 3-point try by Lillard at the buzzer, but it was off the mark. ""When I saw how they were trying to line up around the 3-point line, we knew we had to put up a 3,"" Lillard said. ""We didn't have enough time to get a quick two without timeouts. I knew it would be a tough look. I just missed the rim."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Maurice Harkless remains sidelined by a left knee injury. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed a fourth straight game with left hamstring tightness. ... F Trey Lyles missed his second game in a row with a right wrist sprain. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Wins have been hard to come by for the Cleveland Cavaliers this season, so coach Larry Drew has been focused on the incremental signs of progress. Against the Los Angeles Lakers, Drew saw those little things help put the Cavaliers into the right side of the win column. Cedi Osman scored 20 points, Collin Sexton added 17 and the Cavaliers ended a 12-game losing streak with a 101-95 victory on Sunday night. ""Any time you go through a rebuilt process you're going to have bumps in the road, that's to be expected,"" Drew said. ""But the most important thing for this group is that they learn and there is growth. We understand where we are and who we are, and the most important thing for us right now is just to continue to grow every game we play."" Tristan Thompson had 15 points and 14 rebounds, and Alec Burks had 17 points and 13 rebounds as the short-handed Cavaliers split the two-game season series by forcing the Lakers into a choppy game. Los Angeles was 7 for 34 on 3-pointers, 16 for 27 from the free throw line and had 11 fast-break points. Kyle Kuzma had 29 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who have lost two straight and five of their past seven. Brandon Ingram scored 22 points and Lonzo Ball had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""No disrespect to the Cavs, but they're still an NBA team and for us we can't take anything lightly, especially in this league,"" Kuzma said. ""Because we're all professionals and you can lose on any given night if we don't bring the effort, and that's what happened tonight."" Burks delivered an emphatic dunk after Ingram couldn't handle a defensive rebound to help the Cavaliers re-establish control after Kuzma scored five straight to cut the Cavaliers' lead to 84-79 midway though the four quarter. Sexton drove for a layup and Osman hit a floater during a quick 6-0 run, which allowed the Cavaliers to hold off another late push by the Lakers. Kuzma hit a 3-pointer with 22 seconds remaining to trim the margin to 96-93, but Burks made both free throws with 16 to play. ""When they did score, we continued to play,"" said Cavaliers forward Rodney Hood, who had 18 points. ""We didn't look around and we didn't cave in."" The Cavaliers had a 10-0 run in the third quarter after Kuzma hit a floater to pull the Lakers within 51-50 early in the period. Burks and Osman hit 3-pointers to bookend the push, and Cleveland was able to sustain a 10-point margin going into the fourth by holding Los Angeles to 8-for-26 shooting. ""When we're playing like that and playing together it's fun,"" Sexton said. ""I felt like tonight we had fun and it's been a long time since we had fun."" STEP FORWARD It was a modest night for Sexton, making 7 of 14 shots and adding three rebounds and three assists. Drew was most excited that the rookie from Alabama committed one turnover in 33 minutes. ""He made some really good decisions,"" Drew said. ""He made some really smart plays that probably a month ago he probably wouldn't make, so I saw growth tonight."" SLOW START The Lakers trailed 32-24 after the first quarter, the fifth time in the past six games they allowed at least 30 points in the opening period. Lakers coach Luke Walton said he would consider lineup changes to stop the trend. ""By the end of games we're doing a nice job of stabilizing our defense and getting the stops we need, but we can't just keep giving up 30 points to start the games,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Osman scored eight of the Cavaliers' first 13 points. ... The Cavaliers made 56 percent of their shots in the first quarter (14-for-25 shooting). .

"NEW YORK --  The Boston Celtics had been beating the Brooklyn Nets for years, first in trades and then in games. With D'Angelo Russell on a roll and Kyrie Irving on the bench in street clothes, Brooklyn finally broke through. Russell scored 18 of his 34 points in the third quarter and the Nets ended a 10-game losing streak to Boston with a 109-102 victory on Monday night, sending the Celtics to a winless three-game road trip. The Nets hadn't beaten Boston since Jan. 2, 2016, before Kenny Atkinson became coach. ""Listen, these guys think they can do something special and so far we're making strides,"" Atkinson said of his team that is now seventh in the Eastern Conference. With Irving nursing a bruised right quadriceps, the Nets blew open the game with a 15-0 run in the third quarter and outscored the Celtics 44-21 in the period. Jarrett Allen added 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, who have won nine of their last 10 home games. Rookie Rodions Kurucs also scored 19 points. Jayson Tatum scored 34 points for the Celtics, who dropped games at Miami and Orlando to start their trip. Jaylen Brown added 22 points. ""I can't really put my finger on it,"" the Celtics' Marcus Morris said. ""Yeah, kind of surprised because I thought we were moving in a good direction."" Boston was off from the start, with Brad Stevens calling a timeout just 29 seconds into the game after a turnover led to Russell's 3-pointer and a 3-0 Brooklyn lead. Russell made seven 3-pointers in his second-highest point total in a Nets uniform. ""I trust my craft and I know what I'm capable of,"" said Russell, adding he believed he should be an All-Star this season. But the game didn't get away from the Celtics until the third, when Russell hit three 3-pointers in the 15-0 burst that made it 76-59. Brooklyn then scored seven straight after Terry Rozier's basket, pushing it to 83-61. ""We went on a drought and Brooklyn just blew us out of the water,"" Stevens said. Nets fans have watched their team stumble and the Celtics soar as the result of the 2013 trade that sent Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to Brooklyn, and a number of draft picks to Boston. So a group of fans enjoyed the rare chance to rub it in as the Nets were romping, with a fairly loud ""Kyrie's Leaving! Kyrie's Leaving!"" chant breaking out early in the fourth quarter, when the Nets led by 27. Irving, a free agent after the season, was noticeably frustrated with the Celtics' execution at the end of their loss in Orlando on Saturday. But it was almost a premature celebration, as Boston charged all the way back to get within seven in the final minute. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston also played without Marcus Smart because of an illness. ... Aron Baynes, who has a broken bone in his left hand, will be re-evaluated Tuesday, but Stevens said he didn't know what steps Baynes would have to take to be cleared for a game. Nets: Reserve G Shabazz Napier was sidelined by right hamstring tightness. Fs Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Jared Dudley and G Allen Crabbe remained out with injuries. ... The Nets won for the first time in five games this season on a Monday. They had their most lopsided loss of the season on the previous Monday, falling 116-95 in Boston. TV TALENTS The TV play-by-play announcers for both teams were announced Monday as the sportscasters of the year in their respective states, as voted by the National Sports Media Association. Ian Eagle of Yes Network was honored for the fourth time as New York Sportscaster of the Year, having also won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.

"HOUSTON --  After scoring a season-high 57 points in Houston's win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night, James Harden was asked how he was able to put Sunday's loss to Orlando, when he went 1 for 17 from 3-point range, behind him so quickly. ""I went 1 for 17? That's a lot of 3s missed,"" he deadpanned. ""Oh wow!"" Then the reigning MVP, who scored 38 points against the Magic despite that terrible statistic, got serious when asked if it's easy to forget about such a night. ""Yeah, because if I make six of them it's on,"" he said. ""It's a 60-point game. So Orlando got lucky last night."" Harden extended his streak of 30-point games to 17 by halftime, pouring in a franchise-record 36 points in the first half to send Houston on its way to a 112-94 victory. It's the longest such streak since Wilt Chamberlain had 20 straight games of at least 30 points in 1964. It's the franchise-record 14th time Harden has scored 40 this season and the eighth time in his last 11 games. It's the third time he's topped 50 points this season and the 12th time in his career. He surpassed his previous season best of 54 against Washington and fell just shy of the career-high and club-record 60 points he scored last January against Orlando. Houston teammate Austin Rivers, who joined the Rockets just three weeks ago, marveled at Harden's ability to not let Sunday's struggles spill over into Monday's performance. ""He comes off a game where he was 1 for 17 and everybody's saying whatever and it just doesn't even faze him. He just comes in tonight like he was 17 for 17,"" Rivers said. ""That's just the mindset that the great ones have. I'm telling you right now, if another player went 1 for 17 they would have come in tonight a little ... messed up. James comes in and that's just why he is who he is and it's impressive."" After his huge first half, the Grizzlies double-teamed Harden on most every possession in the first few minutes of the third quarter and he didn't score again until there were about five minutes left in the period. That basket was the start of an 11-0 run capped by a 3-pointer from Harden that pushed the Rockets' lead to 76-60 with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining in the third. A 3-pointer by JaMychal Green got the Grizzlies within 12 later in the third before Harden scored five quick points to make it 87-70. Garrett Temple and Mike Conley scored 14 each for the Grizzlies, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who worked for the Rockets from 2011-16, said his team tried to keep the ball out of Harden's hands, but Houston does such a good job of putting him in different spots on the floor that it's difficult to do effectively. ""There's so much space, so you have to give them credit and give him credit just for the talent he is and the impact he has on the game,"" Bickerstaff said. Harden's latest big game came on a night when the Rockets were without three starters, as center Clint Capela joined Chris Paul and Eric Gordon on the injured list after he hurt his right thumb Sunday night. It's possible Capela could miss significant time, but coach Mike D'Antoni said the team won't know how long he'll be out until he gets a second opinion later this week. Harden made his first two 3s on Monday night to quickly outdo his 3-point shooting from Sunday and finished 6 of 15. It's the 13th time in the last 14 games that he's drained at least five 3s after his NBA-record streak of 12 straight ended with his cold shooting performance against the Magic. Harden made 15 of 17 free throws and had nine rebounds, two assists and two steals. He crashed to the court making a 3 as he was fouled by Green to give him 52 points with just under five minutes remaining. Harden completed the four-point play to make it 103-85. Harden went to the bench to a standing ovation with 3:35 left and Houston ahead 107-85. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Kyle Anderson missed the game after spraining his left ankle Saturday. ... Jaren Jackson Jr. had 12 points. Rockets: Paul missed his 12th game in a row with a strained left hamstring. ... Gordon missed his eighth straight game with a bruised right knee. ... Danuel House had 15 points and Rivers scored 11. ... Nene started in place of Capela. THEY SAID IT Harden on if having the most consecutive 30-point games since Chamberlain means anything to him: ""No. The win was important."" MR. 600 The win was the 600th of D'Antoni's career. The 67-year-old coach had 14 wins in one season in Denver, 253 in five years in Phoenix, 121 in four seasons with the Knicks, 67 in two years with the Lakers and got his 145th victory with Houston in his third season. ""I appreciate these guys and everybody before them,"" D'Antoni said. ""But it just means you've coached some good guys, and you're able to avoid getting fired too many times.""","401071322"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The fans in San Antonio didn't care too much about a rare home loss. They only wanted to shower Tony Parker with love and appreciation. Parker gave them plenty to cheer about, just as he did for 17 seasons with the Spurs. Kemba Walker scored 33 points and Parker enjoyed a triumphant return to San Antonio as the Charlotte Hornets beat the Spurs 108-93 on Monday night, snapping their seven-game home winning streak. ""Draining mentally, emotionally, it was just an awesome night,"" Parker said. ""Just want to thank the fans. The way they reacted tonight was just unbelievable. Love, and I appreciate everything. It was just a great memory and a great night for me that I will cherish for the rest of my life."" Parker had eight points, four assists, three rebounds and no turnovers in his first game back in San Antonio after signing with the Hornets during the offseason. Jeremy Lamb added 19 points and Marvin Williams had 11 for Charlotte, which ended a three-game skid. The Hornets also stopped an 11-game slide in San Antonio. LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs with 28 points and 10 rebounds, but they could not muster enough energy as Parker made his emotional return. ""Just to see him embraced and loved tonight, and he helped us as well,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""A pillar of this community, a pillar of the San Antonio Spurs organization forever. I think it's a pretty good ending to a fun night."" The Spurs honored Parker before the game with a two-minute video of his career highlights in San Antonio, including being drafted with the 28th pick in 2001 and his four NBA championships with the team. After the video, the Spurs' retired jerseys appeared on the video monitors and an empty spot in the rafters was shown to signify Parker's future place among them. The crowd roared in appreciation, chanting ""Tony! Tony! Tony!"" ""I expected nothing less,"" said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who considers Parker like a son. ""Tony is a wonderful human being. He was a great player for us and he deserved all the love that he received, that's for sure."" The cheers continued when Parker entered the game for the first time with 4:50 remaining in the first quarter. Just as he first did as a 19-year-old rookie with the Spurs, the slippery point guard juked past defenders and drove the paint probing for layups or open teammates. His driving layup put the Hornets up 82-79 with 8:15 remaining. ""That was vintage Tony,"" Borrego said. ""We've seen that before many times in this building."" Parker exited shortly after that and did not return until fans demanded it by chanting his name again with 17.6 seconds left. Borrego, a former Spurs assistant, granted their wish and put Parker in amid loud cheers that continued until he came out. ""I thought they supported Tony, like I expected,"" San Antonio point guard Derrick White said. ""He did great things for the organization. It's well deserved. Definitely good to see him. Wish him the best."" Parker had a long embrace with Popovich following the game as fans cheered. The Spurs' ideology has stuck with Parker, who jokingly got angry with his teammates after the win. ""They wanted it bad,"" Parker said. ""Before the game they were like, `We're going to do this for you Tony, you deserve it.' They played so hard that after the game I'm like, `Why don't we play like that every road game? Come on guys."" The jubilation in the stands came despite a rough night for the hometown team. The Spurs opened the game on an 11-3 run but the Hornets followed with a 25-7 spurt to take their first double-digit lead at 28-18. San Antonio struggled offensively, with two of its top five scorers, Rudy Gay and Marco Belinelli, both out with injuries. White finished with 18 points, and DeMar DeRozan and Davis Bertans each had 14 for the Spurs. TIP-INS Hornets: The team's previous win in San Antonio came on Nov. 15, 2006. ... Parker and Michael Jordan are the only players to compete against the team they won four championships with. Jordan faced Chicago while with Washington and Charlotte, a franchise he now owns. ... Borrego received a warm ovation during pregame introductions. He served on Popovich's staff from 2003-10 and again from 2015-18 before joining the Hornets. Spurs: Gay missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left wrist and 10th overall due to injury or rest. ... Belinelli missed his second game of the season after hyperextending his knee during a 122-112 loss at Oklahoma City on Saturday. He previously sat out with a stiff neck on Dec. 2. WELCOME HOME, TOO Parker wasn't the only one who enjoyed a triumphant return. Borrego defeated his friend and mentor, Popovich. ""It was special in many ways,"" Borrego said. ""Just to see (Popovich) first of all. Just to hear his voice, give him a hug, that was most important. This is a basketball game. We do our best, we compete, but there's a lot of love here. Just great to see him. He's been a great encouragement for me. I know he's happy for us.""","401071323"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz discovered an unusual motivator Monday night. All game long, Mitchell heard a persistent heckler in the Utah crowd. ""That loud kid on the sideline. It was really his fault,"" Mitchell said after scoring 28 points to propel the Jazz to a 100-94 victory over the Detroit Pistons. ""I don't know why people like that have to keep talking. I just had to shut him down."" Kyle Korver had 19 points, including five 3-pointers, to help the Jazz win for the sixth time in seven games. Mitchell has poured in at least 26 points in six consecutive games, the best such stretch of his career. Rudy Gobert tied a career high with 25 rebounds and made things difficult for the Pistons, who shot 30 percent in the second half. ""It starts with defense. Just making sure we get a stop. I was able to be there at the right time, right moment,"" said Gobert, who finished with 18 points and two blocks. ""I knew I had one of the best, if not the best, rebounders in the league (Andre Drummond) to box out. It made me a little more aware of that and a little more aggressive."" Mitchell was 1 for 7 over a 14-minute span of the third and fourth quarters and looked worn down. But the second-year guard made a scintillating drive and three-point play with 48.9 seconds to go for a 95-89 Utah lead. The Pistons hounded Mitchell full court and forced him to spend a lot of energy throughout the game just to receive the ball and get to his spots. ""They were blitzing him tonight, but it all starts with him for our team and he came up big,"" Korver said. Joe Ingles, who had 13 points, shut the door on the Pistons by hitting a 3 with 24.2 seconds left that made it 98-91. As the ball went through the hoop, he turned around and blew a kiss to the outnumbered fan. Utah has won five straight against the Pistons and 23 of 27 in the series. Blake Griffin scored 19 points and Drummond contributed 15 points and 13 rebounds for Detroit, which has lost five of six overall. The Pistons, one of the NBA's best offensive rebounding teams, had only five second-chance points. ""With everybody out, we needed to be great with where we're good. Obviously tonight Rudy was great on the boards and took his matchup seriously,"" Korver said. After the Jazz trailed for most of the game, Derrick Favors capped a 13-0 run with a follow dunk to give Utah a 66-62 lead. But the Pistons surged back in front and led 82-78 on Reggie Jackson's floater in the lane. The Pistons led by 12 in the first half despite sending the Jazz to the foul line 24 times and attempting only six free throws themselves. Detroit forced 10 turnovers that led to 16 points and had a 59-53 at the break. For the third straight game, Utah played without a true point guard. Ricky Rubio (hamstring), Dante Exum (ankle) and Raul Neto (groin) were out with injuries. Partly because of that, the Jazz found themselves in unfamiliar positions and driving lanes, often up against the shot clock. Detroit's defense produced 18 turnovers by cutting off paths to the hoop and picking off desperate passes. TIP-INS Pistons: Griffin missed his first six 3-point attempts but made a four-point play in the fourth quarter. ... Drummond got a technical foul with 3:11 left in the fourth, but Mitchell missed the free throw. ... Detroit went 11 for 36 from the 3-point line after a fast start. Jazz: Ingles left the court with 1:26 left in the first half due to a sprained ankle but returned in the second half. ... The Jazz outrebounded the Pistons 55-38. ... Utah has won its last five games when trailing at halftime. ""It shouldn't take us a half to figure it out,"" Mitchell said. AT THE LINE Utah shot 36 free throws to Detroit's 16 -- and the Pistons noticed. ""The thing that hurt worst was the free throw disparity. It's tough to beat somebody when you give them 20 more free throws,"" said Griffin, who took only two foul shots. Detroit coach Dwane Casey added: ""I saw fight. I saw intensity. I saw a disposition that was here to win. But it's disheartening when you see the disparity in the free throws."" ISH IS THE SPIRIT Ish Smith, who missed 19 games with a torn adductor muscle, returned to the court and his coach couldn't have been happier. Smith scored eight points and the Pistons outscored the Jazz by six when he was on the court. ""Ish is our spirit. ... He is the speed of our team. He gets the tempo and pace going,"" Casey said before the game. ""He always has a smile on his face and enjoys playing the game."" In the 19 games Smith missed, the Pistons were 5-14 and their efficiency and shooting percentage dropped precipitously.","401071324"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  It hasn't taken long for Marvin Bagley III to regain his rhythm in Sacramento's offense after missing 11 games with an injured left knee. The second overall pick in the draft still needs to improve his free throw shooting in the fourth quarter, but Bagley is definitely giving the Kings' second unit quite a lift. Bagley had 13 points and 11 rebounds for his fifth double-double, De'Aaron Fox scored 16 points and made a key 3-pointer with 1:30 remaining, and Sacramento beat the Portland Trail Blazers 115-107 on Monday night. ""I feel like I was before I got hurt,"" Bagley said after his fourth game back. ""When I was out, I still was around. I was still shooting, still was doing stuff. I wasn't just sitting out. I was getting in shape, still making sure that I was ready. It wasn't hard to get back into the swing of things."" Bagley made a pivotal 14-foot turnaround jumper early in the fourth quarter, then went over the back of Zach Collins and tipped in an offensive rebound to put the Kings up 100-88. That anchored a big night from Sacramento's bench, which outscored Portland's reserves 58-34. ""He's a walking double-double,"" said Justin Jackson, who had nine points on three 3-pointers. ""You add that back to our team, it adds even more versatility. It allows us to do so many more things within our offense whenever he's out there on the court."" Fox also had nine assists, Buddy Hield scored 19 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 18 on 8-of-10 shooting off the bench. Sacramento has won three straight and four of five. ""We're playing hard, we're defending, making extra efforts,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We're a team where everybody needs to contribute."" Damian Lillard scored 35 points to become the fastest player in Portland history to reach 12,000 for his career. Jusuf Nurkic had six points and 11 rebounds, and CJ McCollum scored six on 2-of-14 shooting. The Trail Blazers, playing the second half of a back-to-back, have lost two straight since winning four in a row. ""We knew coming in that they love to play in transition and we kind of played into their hands,"" Lillard said. ""We turned the ball over and allowed them to get out in transition. They play the fastest pace in the league, so we made it harder on ourselves than it had to be."" Sacramento got out to an early lead, held Portland to 17 points in the second quarter and then held off the Trail Blazers down the stretch. After Lillard's 17-foot jumper cut the Kings' lead to 109-103 with 1:47 remaining, Fox came back down the court and calmly drained his only 3 of the night. Bagley made a free throw and Willie Cauley-Stein added an emphatic dunk that brought the crowd to its feet. Portland struggled offensively across the board, particularly McCollum, who didn't make a shot after halftime. Lillard reached 12,000 points in the third quarter of his 514th game. Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler had been the fastest Trail Blazers player to reach the mark, in his 587th game. ""A lot of guys who come into the league who are capable of doing the same thing don't get the opportunity, the trust or the freedom,"" Lillard said. ""I'm really thankful for the coaching staff that I play for and the teammates that I've been fortunate enough to play with."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard has scored in double figures in 184 consecutive games, breaking a tie with Drexler for the franchise record. . Collins made a tremendous defensive play to block a layup attempt by Yogi Ferrell in the first quarter. . Portland coach Terry Stotts was called for a technical while talking with officials after a foul. Kings: Fox has made at least one steal in 14 straight games, the longest active streak in the NBA. . Iman Shumpert was called for a technical foul in the third quarter. Shumpert later had to be walked to the bench by a teammate after arguing with someone on Portland's bench. Shumpert's three technicals are tied for second-most on the Kings behind Fox, who has four. TEMPERS FLARE Shumpert had to be stopped by arena and Trail Blazers security from going into Portland's locker room after the game. Shumpert was apparently angry at Nurkic, who set a hard screen in the second half. ""Some stuff needed to be between me and him, a conversation between two men,"" Shumpert said. ""Some stuff happened out there that we needed to have a conversation about. That's it."" Nurkic shrugged it off. ""I'm not going to worry about it,"" Nurkic said. ""He's going into retirement soon. I'm not going to worry about a guy who's going into retirement soon."" NOT THIS TIME When the Blazers beat the Kings two weeks ago, Nurkic became the first player in modern NBA history to have at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, five assists, five steals and five blocks. It was a much different story for Nurkic on Monday. Portland's big man had five assists and one block but took only seven shots and did not make a steal.","401071325"
"LOS ANGELES --  Anthony Davis missed his first five shots and scored just four points in the first quarter, announcing to his teammates on the bench that he stunk. They didn't think so -- and they were right. Davis finished with 46 points and 16 rebounds, Julius Randle scored 27 and the New Orleans Pelicans recovered after blowing a 20-point lead in the second half to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 121-117 on Monday night for just their second road win this season against a Western Conference team. ""I was missing some easy shots, but that doesn't discourage me. I just keep shooting the same shots,"" Davis said. ""Once I was finding the rhythm they told me to go get the ball."" Davis and Randle combined to score 24 of their team's 28 points in the third quarter, when the Pelicans stretched their lead to 20. ""If it wasn't one person, it was the other,"" teammate Jrue Holiday said. ""I would hate to be the opposing team."" But the Clippers chipped away, outscoring New Orleans 15-2 over the final 4 1/2 minutes to close to 94-88 heading into the fourth. And they weren't done yet. Danilo Gallinari hit a 3-pointer off an inbounds pass from Patrick Beverley with 0.3 seconds left on the shot clock. Gallinari got fouled and made the free throw for a 101-100 lead, completing a 13-6 spurt that opened the quarter. New Orleans quickly snatched the lead back. Darius Miller made a 3, launching a 15-6 run that included 3s by Davis and Holiday and put the Pelicans back in front 115-106. Davis even played through one sequence without a sneaker after losing it on the court. ""Anthony Davis was spectacular,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I knew he would get it going. We found a way to get him the ball near the basket. It just started to click for him."" Holiday got poked in the right eye by Gallinari on a foul. Holiday missed both free throws and Lou Williams hit three consecutive layups that drew the Clippers within two. Davis made all 12 of his foul shots in the game, including four in a row to close it out. ""We got stops in big moments,"" said Holiday, who finished with 19 points. ""They come out and punch us in the mouth. We withstood the punch."" The Pelicans improved to 6-17 on the road, including 2-10 versus the West. Montrezl Harrell led the Clippers with 26 points and 10 rebounds. Gallinari added 25 points, Tobias Harris had 21, Williams scored 18 and Beverley had 11 rebounds. ""We have to stop putting ourselves in these holes,"" Harrell said. ""Yeah, we do a great job coming out and fighting and getting back into it, but we are running out of gas."" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans won the season series 2-1, with all three games decided by seven points or less. ... F Nikola Mirotic was limited to 17 minutes five days after he returned from a right ankle injury. Clippers: Have lost three in a row for the second time this season. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana has its sights set on the top of the Eastern Conference standings. On Tuesday night, the Phoenix Suns found themselves directly in the way of a determined Pacers team. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 20 points and the Pacers wasted little time cruising to a 131-97 victory. While impressive, Tuesday's lopsided win isn't the type of performance that's fueling the Pacers. ""We've proven we can (beat teams like Phoenix) before,"" guard Victor Oladipo said. ""The next step is winning against really good teams -- the Raptors, Milwaukee, Celtics, Golden State. That's the next step, beating (those teams) consistently. ""At the end of the day, it's over. This game is completely over. We have a big game on Thursday against a team who's really close to us in the standings and the top of the East. We need to take care of business then. That's what it's all about."" The Pacers face Philadelphia on Thursday. The Pacers got off to a fast start thanks to Bogdanovic, who scored the Indiana's first 10 points. The Pacers doubled the Suns' total in the first quarter, leading 38-19 at the end of the period. Myles Turner returned for the first time in four games to finish with 18 points and six rebounds. Turner was nursing a sore right shoulder over the last week. ""There was definitely some rust,"" Turner said. ""I was a step behind. But it was a great team performance and that's all that matters."" The Pacers led by as many as 37 in a game in which they never trailed. Cory Joseph scored eight of his 10 points in the first quarter, adding to Bogdanovic's hot start. Thaddeus Young scored 10 of his 12 points in the first half and finished the game with seven rebounds. Joseph was one of three Pacers who scored in double figures off the bench. Tyreke Evans scored 20 and Domantas Sabonis finished with 14 and eight rebounds in their usual reserve roles. The Suns made it interesting briefly in the first half. Phoenix pulled within seven points in the second quarter, but Indiana never let the Suns regain momentum long enough for it to matter. The Pacers pulled back ahead once again by double digits, leading 62-51 at halftime, and never looked back. Indiana limited Devin Booker to eight points in 26 minutes. Rookie Deandre Ayton finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. T.J. Warren led Phoenix with 18 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 16 points off the bench. ""We didn't show up"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We were down the entire game. In the second quarter, we played the way we were supposed to . but there is not much we can take from this game."" COMING IN HOT Indiana's 34-point blowout of Phoenix kicks off a five-game homestand where the Pacers will face Philadelphia, Dallas, Charlotte and Toronto in the next eight days. The Pacers' 34-point win was the third 30-plus point margin of victory this season, which marks the first time since the 1993-94 season that Indiana has compiled three or more 30-point victories. Indiana's 131 points its second-most this season. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix is 2-5 in January. ...

"PHILADELPHIA --  Jimmy Butler's final miserable months in Minnesota were blighted by trash talk toward his teammates and a sour demeanor that forced the Timberwolves to trade him. At home in Philadelphia, Butler is still working out the kinks with his new star teammates. But Butler had one final parting gift for his old team: a complete thrashing that left the Timberwolves in tatters. Butler scored 19 points in the first meeting with Minnesota since the trade, and the 76ers scored 83 points in the first half in a 149-107 rout on Tuesday night. ""I do want to beat those guys,"" Butler said, ""but I want to beat every team."" The Golden State Warriors were the only team to score more first-half points in a game this season when they dropped 92 on the Chicago Bulls on Oct. 29. The Sixers hit a team-record 21 3-pointers and reached their highest point total in the 22-year history of the Wells Fargo Center. Joel Embiid had 31 points and 13 rebounds in a final tuneup before the Sixers hit a pivotal stretch of the season. ""We've got some heavyweights coming in but so be it,"" coach Brett Brown said. The Sixers needed the breather against Minnesota. They play their next 12 games against teams with winning records and the Sixers are not quite where Brown wants them as they go toe-to-toe with those NBA heavyweights. ""Not to the level that I wished it was,"" Brown said. ""It's not anything that I'm panicking about."" They never had reason to worry about Minnesota. The Sixers stuffed a season's worth of highlights into the first half. They cut to the hoop with ease for layups and big Ben Simmons dunks. They buried mostly uncontested 3-pointers -- 10 of 20 in the half -- and even made all 11 free throws. Simmons, who had 20 points and 11 rebounds, flexed and Embiid waved his arms to an adoring crowd after big baskets. Butler took a backseat in his first game since the Timberwolves sent him to the 76ers in a package deal that brought forwards Robert Covington and Dario Saric in return. ""It was everything that I thought it would be,"" Butler said. ""Seeing some old faces. Not too much trash talking, though, I don't think anybody's talking like that. I like the fact that we beat them."" Covington and Saric were popular core pieces of Philadelphia's Trust the Process rebuild and both received massive ovations from an appreciative crowd in tribute videos. ""It means they really appreciate what I did the last three years here,"" Saric said. ""I'm thankful for that. They really respect me."" The Sixers found thumping the Timberwolves a breeze. They're having a tougher time molding the Butler-Simmons-Embiid combination into a dominant Big 3 instead of a big mystery. The Sixers have a thin bench and are experimenting with rotations to find the right ones that can make them evolve into the Eastern Conference favorites they expected to become this season. Sixers rookie general manager Elton Brand hits the Feb. 7 trade deadline with a major mission: strengthen the reserves. Former Sixers Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova steadied the Sixers last season as midseason pickups and Brown needs more of that punch for a deep run in the East this season. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Derrick Rose led the Timberwolves with 15 points and Saric had 11 in his return. Covington sat out with a knee injury. Tyus Jones left with a sprained left ankle. ""We'll look at the film and work on moving forward,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Our communication was not up to our standards."" 76ers: Signed G Corey Brewer to a 10-day contract. He has career averages of 8.9 points and 2.8 rebounds in 783 games. WHAT A HALF The team record for points in a first half is 86. The Sixers shot 66 percent (31 of 47) and had 21 assists on 31 baskets. JIMMY JAM Butler had voiced his frustration with the state of the Timberwolves and was soon traded to the Sixers. The Sixers need more big games from him to contend. ""There are times that I wished he'd shoot more 3s. There are times I wished he'd put this thumbprint deeper into the game,"" Brown said. ""But he plays the game the right way."" SIR CHARLES Sir Charles is ready for his close up. Charles Barkley, the 76ers great whose retired No. 34 hangs in the rafters, is set to play a substitute gym teacher in Wednesday's episode of ""The Goldbergs."" ""In my gym, we've got two rules. Number one, we NEVER give up. Number two, aliens are real and they walk among us,"" he says in the episode.

"ATLANTA --  Just when it seemed Dennis Schroder would enjoy a triumphant return to Atlanta, his successor as the Hawks' starting point guard had a winning answer. Trae Young had 24 points and 11 assists to win the showdown of current and past Atlanta point guards, leading the Hawks over the Oklahoma City Thunder 142-126 on Tuesday night. ""Tonight the shots just kept falling,"" said Young, who had four 3-pointers. ""When you see the ball go in like we did tonight, I think it just keeps rolling."" Schroder scored 21 points, including 14 in the third quarter. He had the Thunder's final 11 points of the period, the last six on free throws, for a 100-97 lead. Young answered with 13 points in the final period as the Hawks enjoyed their second 45-point quarter of the game. The Hawks outscored Oklahoma City 45-30 in the second period and 45-26 in the closing period. The win was especially sweet for Young, the former star for his home-state Oklahoma Sooners. ""It feels good,"" Young said. ""... To get a win against one of the top teams in the league is pretty special for us."" The Thunder are third in the West but have lost three of four. The Hawks have won eight of their last 15 but still rank ahead of only three teams in the Eastern Conference. Paul George said the Thunder were ""a little flat."" ""These are the games that we have to be ready for, one of those games that we were supposed to roll and that didn't happen tonight,"" George said. ""When you play a team like the Hawks, you have to match their energy and we didn't do that tonight."" Russell Westbrook led Oklahoma City with 31 points and 11 assists. George had 24 points and Jerami Grant added 21. That wasn't enough scoring to match the Hawks, who made 18 of 37 3-pointers. Atlanta set a season scoring high. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said his team didn't play winning defense. ""What did we score tonight, 126 points?"" Donovan asked. ""That should be good enough for us to win."" John Collins made 12 of 14 shots from the field and led Atlanta with 26 points. Alex Len had 24 points and 11 rebounds. The Hawks were 18 of 37 on 3-pointers. Young opened the final period with a tying 3-pointer. He added a three-point play and another basket as the Hawks regained momentum. A jam by Omari Spellman pushed Atlanta's lead to 117-107, and another dunk by Spellman pushed the advantage to 121-109. A steal and reverse jam by DeAndre Bembry iced the win. TIP-INS Thunder: F Nerlens Noel (concussion protocol) ""is doing a little more each day,"" Donovan said before the game. ... G Alex Abrines (personal reasons) missed his eighth straight game. Hawks: G Jeremy Lin (flu-like symptoms) was not with the team. F Taurean Prince was limited in his second game back while recovering from similar symptoms. ...

""I told our equipment guy, Zac (Walsh) that we have to play in those uniforms for the rest of the month,"" said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce. The uniforms were introduced as part of the Hawks' 50-year celebration in Atlanta. HOMECOMING Schroder was happy to be traded to a contender but said his time with the Hawks ""was special."" The Hawks had a ""welcome back"" video tribute for Schroder during a first-quarter timeout. Schroder raised his arm to acknowledge the fans. ""I appreciated it a lot,"" he said.","401071329"
"MILWAUKEE --  Held well below his season scoring average, Giannis Antetokounmpo found other ways to help the Milwaukee Bucks win. Antetokounmpo had 12 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in his fourth triple-double of the season, and the Bucks cruised past the Miami Heat 124-86 on Tuesday night. Antetokounmpo, who averages nearly 27 points, took just nine shots as the Bucks benefited from having seven players score in double figures. ""He didn't need to (score),"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He read the game and saw that everybody else was going off and he didn't get in the way."" The triple-double was the 13th of his career. ""(Giannis) has such great court vision,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think all year he has done a great job of balancing scoring and facilitating."" Eric Bledsoe had 17 points and Malcolm Brogdon added 16 for Milwaukee, which has won 13 of 16 dating to Dec. 14. The Bucks improved to 31-12, second-best in the NBA. They are a season-high 19 games over .500. Justise Winslow and Hassan Whiteside had 19 points apiece for Miami, which fell to 21-21. Spoelstra expressed frustration with his team's effort. ""I didn't see this one coming. I don't know if our locker room saw this one coming,"" Spoelstra said. ""They are a very good team and you have to bring your best game against them and it starts with your effort and focus. We didn't bring those things."" Milwaukee used a 12-0 run midway through the second quarter to pull away. The Bucks led by 26 late in the period. Antetokounmpo had five points, eight rebounds and six assists in the first half. A lack of focus after the Bucks jumped out in front ruined the Heat's chances for a comeback, Winslow said. ""There were a couple of stretches that we became disconnected from each other and the game,"" he said. ""Guys looked like they didn't want to be here when we got down by 20, but we can't have that. We have to keep that competitive edge."" The Bucks built a 31-point lead in the third quarter and held a 93-63 advantage heading to the fourth. Milwaukee's lead grew to as many as 38, the final margin, in the fourth as both teams turned to their reserves early. ""We were in a zone (defense) and they started to hit some 3s,"" Whiteside said. ""I think we started to overact and miscommunicated."" The Bucks had a 13-2 run to close out the first quarter and grab a 30-23 lead despite shooting 39 percent. Whiteside had 10 points in the quarter for Miami. TIP-INS Heat: Started a four-game trip and play 12 of their next 16 on the road. ... Whiteside returned to the lineup after missing Saturday's game due to illness. ... G Josh Richardson started after not participating in the team's practice on Monday due to knee tendinitis. Bucks: Signed forward Bonzie Colson to a two-way contract. Colson has spent the 2018-19 season with the Canton Charge of the G league after going undrafted out of Notre Dame. ... Brogdon missed just his third free throw in 88 attempts this season. ... All 13 players scored. BANGED UP Antetokounmpo, who has been dealing with right quadriceps soreness and a left hip contusion, played his second consecutive game after sitting out against Washington on Friday. ""Sometimes during the season, you get some bangs and some bruises,"" Budenholzer said. ""The more we can manage how much he does either on off days or practice days or shootarounds, but he's not easy to dial back. We just need to make sure that he stays as healthy as possible."" UNUSUAL SURROUNDINGS Dwyane Wade starred at Marquette, which played its home games at the Bradley Center until moving into the Bucks' new arena, the Fiserv Forum, when it opened this season. Demolition crews imploded the massive roof of the neighboring Bradley Center on Sunday. ""Normally, I come back and I can look around the arena and think about moments I had at Marquette and the Bradley Center,"" Wade said. ""This is definitely a little different in a new arena. It was definitely a home-court advantage. We lost one game in my two years there.""","401071330"
"DENVER --  Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors weren't trying to send any sort of message or make any kind of statement against a team they were chasing in the Western Conference. ""They know who we are,"" Durant said. Still, message received. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson each scored 31 points as the Warriors, propelled by an NBA-record, 51-point first quarter, regained the top spot in the West by routing the Denver Nuggets 142-111 on Tuesday night. ""Beautiful, beautiful basketball,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""Just liked the way our guys moved the ball, the shot fakes, playing with purpose, playing with a simple style of execution but aggressive at the same time. Finding that balance is always what we're looking for. That was as good as it gets for us. ""I don't remember a better first quarter. That was a fireworks show."" Golden State cruised to a fifth straight win to move a half-game in front of the Nuggets, who had their 12-game home winning streak snapped. The showdown between the top two teams in the conference proved a little too big for the Nuggets, with Curry and Co. putting on a shooting exhibition all night long. Durant hit the first shot of the night, a 12-footer, as the Warriors broke the old first-quarter mark of 50 held by several teams. The last time it happened was also against Denver when Phoenix scored 50 on Nov. 10, 1990. ""They came in with an edge and we didn't have that edge to start the game,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""I don't think anybody on our team is scared of the Golden State Warriors or too respectful. They took it to another level and left us in the dust."" Golden State shot a blistering 60 percent from the field, had 38 assists and hit 21 3-pointers -- 10 in the first quarter -- in leading wire-to-wire. Durant finished with 27 points and Draymond Green was a plus-41 as he had 13 assists to go with four points. ""When we make shots, we're a tough team to beat,"" Curry said. Malik Beasley finished with 22 points for the Nuggets. Big man Nikola Jokic struggled with early foul trouble, finishing with 17 points and eight assists in 23 minutes. ""We're not a bad team,"" Jokic said. ""The game just happened."" Denver knocked off Golden State 100-98 in Denver on Oct. 21 thanks to Juancho Hernangomez blocking a layup at the buzzer. This version of the matchup was never close. And this demonstrates just how dominant the Warriors were in the opening half: Denver scored 60, shooting 49 percent from the floor, and still trailed by 19 at the break. As tempting is it might be to erase this game from memory, Malone won't let his team hit the reset button. ""I don't believe in flushing games when you get your (expletive) kicked,"" Malone said. ""Take this failure of tonight, learn from it and use it moving forward. If you can do that, this negative becomes a positive in the long run."" TIP-INS Warriors: Green was given a technical in the second quarter for arguing a call. ...  F Kevon Looney grabbed 12 rebounds. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed a fifth straight game with tightness in his left hamstring. ... G Jamal Murray scored 21. THE COUSINS COUNTDOWN Golden State center DeMarcus Cousins remains on schedule to make his Warriors debut Friday in Los Angeles against the Clippers. He's been steadily progressing after tearing his left Achilles tendon last January while with New Orleans. Cousins signed a one-year deal with Golden State in the offseason. ""When he's healthy, he's one of the more unstoppable big men in the NBA,"" said Malone, who coached Cousins when they were both with Sacramento. ""He'll give them a definite lift."" DUNK CONTEST Thompson and former teammate Zaza Pachulia, now with Detroit, are keeping track of who has the most dunks. ""He texted me after the game and said he's never seen me have four dunks,"" Thompson said. ""Felt better than hitting 10 3s, to be honest.""","401071331"
"Lonzo Ball admits the Lakers had been frustrated with their recent play and their game vs. Chicago was treated as a must-win. (0:31) LOS ANGELES --  Lonzo Ball and the Los Angeles Lakers were angry after the NBA's worst team broke a long losing streak on their home floor. They weren't about to let the league's second-worst team do the same thing on Tuesday night. Ball scored 13 of his 19 points in the second half as the Lakers handed the Chicago Bulls their eighth straight loss with a 107-100 victory. It was just the fourth win in 11 games for Los Angeles since LeBron James was sidelined with a groin injury. ""It was a must-win today, I knew I had to pick up whatever I could,"" said Ball, who also had rebounds and six assists. ""We were missing shots early but we got it together."" The game was close for the first 28 minutes before Los Angeles took control. It was tied at 48 with 9:24 remaining in the third quarter when the Lakers went on a 13-7 run, which included eight straight points at the start. Tyson Chandler scored the first two points before Ball scored 11 straight, including three 3-pointers. ""He's got a knack for hitting big shots. He's not afraid to knock down a 3 when we needed it,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""What is great is seeing him more confident in getting to the rim. He can draw contact but still be able to finish."" Chicago got within 72-68 on a 3-pointer by Wayne Seldon, but the Lakers pulled away again with six straight points to end the third and start the fourth. Los Angeles' lead grew to 94-76 with 4:26 remaining in the game before Chicago made a late flurry to get within 103-98 in the final minute. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who got just his fourth start of the season, scored 17 points while Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma scored 16 apiece. The Lakers erased the bitter taste of a 101-95 loss Sunday to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who ended a 12-game skid, and gained some confidence going into a three-game stretch where they face Oklahoma City, Houston and Golden State. ""We've been losing and wanted to go out on the road with some momentum,"" Ball said. Jabari Parker came off the bench to lead Chicago with 18 points and Lauri Markkanen added 17. ""We have to play better basketball for more of the game. We played about 28 to 35 minutes of good basketball and had 12 minutes of not good basketball,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""We don't have enough firepower to be able to turn it on and take over the game. We have to plow through it and get the lead and hold on to it."" Both teams struggled shooting from the floor in the first quarter, but the Lakers held a 19-18 lead, marking the first time in eight games they led after the first 12 minutes. Los Angeles held a 44-43 lead at halftime as the first half had 22 lead changes and five ties. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago's 8 of 28 from the field in the first quarter was its second-worst opening 12 minutes of the season. It was 8 of 29 in a Dec. 26 loss to Minnesota. ... The Bulls were 7 of 17 on 3-pointers in the second half after going 2 of 14 in the first. Lakers: Kuzma also had 12 rebounds as he recorded his third double-double of the season. ... The Lakers were 2 of 15 on 3-pointers in the first half but 6 of 11 in the second half, which included three from Ball. LINEUP CHANGE Walton changed his starting lineup, putting Tyson Chandler at center and Caldwell-Pope at guard while moving JaVale McGee and Josh Hart to the bench. Chandler, who got his third start, scored eight points and had three rebounds in 26 minutes. Walton was also pleased with Caldwell-Pope holding Zach LaVine to 10 points, including 4 of 11 from the field, as well as what McGee and Hart provided off the bench. ""I'm sure there was some anger but they both engaged. You could tell by Josh's defensive demeanor in the fourth that he was locked in,"" Walton said. NUMBER OF NOTE The Lakers have won all four games since James' injury when Ingram had six assists or more. He had seven against the Bulls. ""It is a chance for me to get everyone involved and show another part of my game,"" Ingram said. ""With me getting in the lane the defense collapses and a lot of guys are open.""","401071332"
"DETROIT --  Andre Drummond's bad habits bother Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey. Luckily for Casey and the Pistons, Drummond's good moments can win basketball games. Drummond put up his version of a triple-double on Wednesday and the Pistons notched a crucial 120-115 overtime victory over the Orlando Magic. Drummond had 14 points, 11 offensive rebounds and 11 defensive rebounds to record his 11th career ""Moses Malone triple-double."" Only Malone (24) and Dennis Rodman (17) have recorded more since the ABA-NBA merger. ""Andre's the best rebounder in the league -- it isn't even close -- and that's a huge asset,"" Casey said. Drummond, though, doesn't impress his coach as a point guard, especially when he tries to go coast-to-coast after a rebound. ""Andre and I are going to have a heart-to-heart talk about his sashays down the court,"" he said. ""Those aren't winning plays, because teams aren't going to let a center dribble down the floor and score. It might happen once a month."" Drummond finished with 11 of the game's 22 rebounds. Detroit ended up with a 14-8 edge on the boards. ""That was the game,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""In the last 42 seconds, we were up two and got two stops, but they got three offensive rebounds and tie the game."" Blake Griffin scored 30 points for the Pistons, who won for the third time in 11 games and moved a half-game ahead of Orlando in the Eastern Conference standings. Detroit had six players with at least 13 points. ""I thought we were sluggish, which is understandable coming off a West Coast trip, but we dug down defensively,"" Griffin said. ""In overtime, we were getting stops and forcing them into shots that we wanted. That was great."" Nikola Vucevic and Terrence Ross each scored 24 points for Orlando, which had won two in a row after a four-game losing streak. ""We had to find a way to win that game,"" Ross said. ""We didn't play a consistent defensive game. We weren't physical enough in the third quarter."" Detroit led by as many as 11 in the fourth quarter, but Vucevic helped pull the Magic within 105-104 with 3:23 to play and tied it at 107 with 2:14 to go. D.J. Augustin followed with a layup to put Orlando ahead, and the teams went scoreless on their next possessions. Drummond's tip-in tied the game at 109-all, and Vucevic missed a jumper with 20.4 seconds left. ""It was a good play, but no one makes every shot,"" Clifford said. ""We scored 109 points in regulation, and if we defend the way we are capable, we win the game. This wasn't about making shots."" Griffin ran down the clock, but missed a jumper at the end of regulation. Detroit scored the first four points of overtime, but Ross answered with a pair of 3-pointers. ""I raised T from a pup, and I'm thrilled that he's become one of the best shooters in the game,"" said Casey, who coached Ross in Toronto during his first five seasons. ""I just wish he wouldn't do it against us."" Both teams struggled to score after that, and the Magic called a timeout with 42.5 seconds left, trailing 117-115. Vucevic missed a hook, and Griffin hit a layup in traffic to give Detroit a four-point lead. The Magic shot 67.5 percent from the floor in the first half, but the Pistons were able to hold the margin to 63-58 with a 6-1 rebounding advantage on the offensive glass and nine free throws to Orlando's three. Vucevic and Ross had 15 each for the Magic, while Griffin led Detroit with 12. Ish Smith's 3-pointer gave the Pistons a 75-74 lead late in the third quarter, and Griffin's nine points in the period helped Detroit take a 90-84 lead into the fourth. The Pistons reserves, supplemented by Drummond, started the final period with a 7-2 run to expand the margin to 11 with 9:45 to play. TIP INS Magic: Orlando has lost 20 of its last 26 games in Detroit. They trail this season's series 2-1, with the final game on March 28 at Little Caesars Arena. Pistons: Detroit, which leads the league in offensive-rebound margin, had 10 or more for the 30th time this season. . Griffin came into the game averaging 20.2 points in 13 career games against Orlando, his lowest average against any team other than 18.7 against the Memphis Grizzlies. DRUMMOND'S PERSONAL STAT Drummond's 11 triple-doubles of points, offensive rebounds and defensive rebounds is four more than any active player (Tyson Chandler 7) and more than twice than the players in third (Hassan Whiteside, Dwight Howard 4). This season, he has three of the league's five with Whiteside and Clint Capela each having one.","401071333"
"Kyrie Irving explains that he called LeBron James after the Celtics' loss to the Magic because he finally understand what it meant to be a leader of a team. (2:02) BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving said he regretted criticizing his younger teammates, then he made a call to a former teammate he also owed an apology. The Celtics point guard said on Wednesday that he called LeBron James over the weekend to apologize for failing to understand the burden the four-time NBA MVP carried when they played together on the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""I had to call Bron, and tell him I apologize for being that young player that wanted everything at his fingertips,"" Irving said after the Celtics beat the Toronto Raptors 118-107 on Wednesday night. ""I wanted to be the guy that led us to a championship. I wanted to be the leader. I wanted to be all that."" Returning after missing the previous game with a bruised right leg, Irving hit a foul-line fadeaway to give Boston the lead for good, then hit a 31-foot 3-pointer to finish with 27 points. He had 10 points and six of his career-high 18 assists in the fourth quarter -- including passes to set up Boston's last three baskets in a game-ending 17-4 run. ""Somehow people still think I can't pass,"" Irving said. ""When guys are making shots, it made my job a lot easier."" The win snapped a three-game losing streak -- all on the road. In lengthy comments after a loss in Orlando on Saturday, Irving called out his less-experienced teammates and said: ""We have a lot of learning to do."" But he said he came to regret what he said, or at least how he said it. ""I did a poor job of setting an example for these young guys what it's like to get something out of your teammates,"" he said. ""Going forward, I want to test these young guys, but I can't do it publicly. That was a learning experience for me, realizing the magnitude of my voice and what I mean to these guys."" And that also made him realize that he owed James an apology for bristling when the star returned from Miami to a Cleveland team that Irving had come to think of as his own. ""He's been in this situation, been there with me, where I've been the young guy, been the 22-year-old kid, wanting everything, wanting everything right now,"" Irving said. ""The responsibility of being the best player in the world and leading a team is something that's not meant for many people. And Bron was one of those guys that came to Cleveland and tried to really show us what it's like to win a championship. And it was hard for him. Sometimes getting the most out of the group is not the easiest thing in the world. Fewer are meant for it or chosen for it. And I felt like the best person to call was him."" Al Horford scored 24 and Jayson Tatum had 16 points and 10 rebounds for Boston, which returned home after losing three straight on the road. Kawhi Leonard scored 33 points and Serge Ibaka had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Raptors, who had won five in a row heading into the matchup of two teams that consider themselves the heir to James' Cavaliers as the best team in the East. Toronto (33-13) fell percentage points behind Milwaukee (32-12) for the best records in the NBA. ""For the most part this year, when we've had a really tough team we've responded,"" said Gordon Hayward, who scored 18 points off the bench. ""But we haven't played like that every single night."" Toronto led 104-100 after Leonard's three-point play with 4:22 left before Boston scored 17 of the next 19 points. Tatum had a three-point play and then a 3-pointer to give Boston a 106-104 lead, before Toronto tied it. Irving then hit consecutive baskets, popping his jersey for the adoring crowd after connecting on the second from just a step or two inside the center tipoff circle. He then went to the pass, assisting on Boston's last three baskets of the game before Toronto's last bucket ended it. ""The last three minutes of the game got away from us,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. After adding Leonard in the offseason, the Raptors have zoomed to the top of the conference standings. But despite getting Irving and Hayward back from injuries that kept them out of last year's playoffs, when the team went to the conference finals, the Celtics have stumbled their way to the fifth-best record in the East. The Celtics made just one of their first 11 shots in the fourth, giving up nine straight points to trail 92-89 midway through the quarter. But Aron Baynes, who had made 12 3-pointers all season, hit one from the top of key to stop the run and tie it. TRAINER'S ROOM Kyle Lowry, who finished with 10 points and seven assists, was poked in the left eye by teammate Pascal Siakam while the two were trying to defend Marcus Smart in the lane. Lowry went down under the basket for the rest of the possession but stayed in the game after a timeout. Baynes, who missed a month with a broken bone in his left hand, returned and played 14 minutes, scoring nine points with five rebounds. Irving and Smart also returned after missing Monday's game in Brooklyn.","401071334"
"HOUSTON -- Spencer Dinwiddie didn't seem to be nearly as wowed by his late-game scoring for the Brooklyn Nets as he was by the fact that his team got an overtime victory on a night when James Harden had a season-high 58 points. ""The man had 60 and we won,"" Dinwiddie said, shaking his head and only slightly exaggerating Harden's performance. ""That's big time for a young group."" Dinwiddie scored 25 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, and the Nets spoiled Harden's night with a 145-142 victory over the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. Harden had his second straight season high after scoring 57 in a victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night, but he was only 5-of-19 from 3-point range. The Rockets shot an NBA-record 70 3s, making just 23. He has scored at least 30 points in 18 straight games and has reached 40 in nine of the past 12. He was 16-of-34 overall from the field, made 21 of 23 free throws and had 10 rebounds and six assists. But Harden was disappointed that his team squandered an eight-point lead with about a minute left in the fourth and a seven-point advantage in overtime. ""Frustrating,"" Harden said. ""Very frustrating."" Dinwiddie forced overtime, making three 3-pointers in the final 30 seconds of regulation. In the extra period, he hit the go-ahead basket with 28 seconds left. ""Just fantastic. He was unbelievable,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""The 3s were great, but I also love how he was driving the ball to the rim too."" Dinwiddie said he didn't really have time to celebrate his hot shooting as it was happening and kept a businesslike mindset. ""It was like: 'Down nine. Down six. Down three. Oh, tied? Let's get a stop,'"" he said about his 3-point spree. ""That's really all it was."" After Harden made three free throws to give the Rockets a one-point lead, James Nunnally -- who signed a 10-day contract Wednesday -- hit a 3-pointer to make it 142-135 with 1:28 left in overtime. Treveon Graham made a 3 for Brooklyn and Jarrett Allen made a basket but missed a free throw to cut the lead to 142-140. But the Nets grabbed a rebound and Dinwiddie, who had seven points in overtime, made a three-point play to put Brooklyn up 143-142. Austin Rivers missed a 3 for Houston, and Joe Harris made two free throws to make it 145-142 with 1.6 seconds left. Houston had a chance to tie it at the buzzer, but Gerald Green's shot clanged off the rim. Allen had 20 points and a career-high 24 rebounds, Graham had a career-high 21 points, and DeMarre Carroll added a season-best 22. Harden agreed that fatigue contributed to this loss on a night when he and Rivers both played more than 45 minutes and PJ Tucker almost 42. ""A little bit,"" Harden said. ""We were small. You've got James [Nunnally] out there his first game, and we had a couple of mistakes out there near the end. But give them credit. They made some big shots."" The Rockets broke their own record for 3-point attempts after shooting 61 against the New Orleans Pelicans on Dec. 16, 2016. Houston also holds the record for most 3-pointers made after hitting 26 in a win over the Washington Wizards this season. Green, who did not attempt a 2-point basket, made 5-of-15. The Rockets were up by 11 with about 2 minutes left when Brooklyn used a 9-3 run to get to 127-122 with about 30 seconds remaining. Tucker made two free throws after that, and Dinwiddie made a 3 for Brooklyn with 26.2 seconds remaining to cut it to 128-125. Harden made one of two free throws, and Dinwiddie struck again with another 3 about five seconds later to get Brooklyn within one. Tucker missed two free throws, but Harden grabbed a rebound with 12.7 seconds left. He made both free throws. Then Dinwiddie made a third straight 3-pointer to tie it up with 8.4 seconds left. Harden had a chance to win it in regulation, but his 3-point attempt bounced off the rim. TIP-INS Nets: Jared Dudley missed his third straight game with a strained left hamstring. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Milwaukee Bucks are doing more than just winning. They are dominating opponents. The Bucks won their third straight game and 14th of the last 17 Wednesday night with a 111-101 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. The victory marked the 23rd time the Bucks have won by double-digits and they entered the game with a 16.2-point winning margin in their previous 13 victories. Wednesday's win over Memphis would have added to that point differential, if not for a closing run by the Grizzlies. Milwaukee led by 31 in the fourth quarter with about 8 minutes left. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 27 points and 11 rebounds, while Eric Bledsoe had 16 points, 12 of which came during a momentum-swinging third quarter. Memphis had pulled ahead 59-58 for its only lead of the game and Antetokounmpo was headed to the bench with his fourth foul, a situation that should have meant advantage Grizzlies. Instead, Bledsoe scored nine straight points, part of the Bucks reeling off a 19-0 run to end of any Memphis hopes. ""Eric Bledsoe was phenomenal. He really changed the game,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said, later adding: ""We needed him. We needed someone to step up and have a game like that."" The Memphis situation is entirely different from the Bucks. The Grizzlies lost their third straight and are 7-20 since starting the season 12-5. And that third quarter in which the Bucks took over the game was the latest nightmare for the Grizzlies. The 19-0 Milwaukee burst led to the Bucks outscoring Memphis 41-28 in the frame. And Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff continued to repeat the key stat in his postgame comments -- eight turnovers for 20 Milwaukee points in the third. ""It's pretty simple,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Unforced turnovers, live ball turnovers at the top of the floor that lead to transition dunks, easy baskets."" The Memphis reserves played better than the starters, with Omri Casspi leading the Grizzlies with 17 points, JaMychal Green added 14 points, along with 10 rebounds and three blocks. Mike Conley and Marc Gasol also scored 14 points each for Memphis. And the Memphis miseries are leading to frustration for the Grizzlies. ""We've lost 10, lost 11, so we've got to take a stance as a team and we've got to stop this slide,"" Casspi said. ""It's been like that for a while, so enough talking. We've got to do more on the court."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee leads the series 23-22. . Antetokounmpo recorded his 30th double-double of the season. . Memphis defeated the Bucks 116-113 on Nov. 14.

NEXT STARTER As Bickerstaff tries to find some combination to get a boost for his team, he inserted Justin Holiday into the starting lineup. Holiday, obtained from the Chicago Bulls in a Jan. 4 trade, lasted about four minutes before he picked up his second foul and didn't re-enter the game until the second half. ""We need him to play well,"" Bickerstaff said. ""We need him to be comfortable so that he can contribute at the level that we think we can."" Holiday finished with five points, including making his first 3-pointer for Memphis. VIEW FROM THE BENCH Antetokounmpo got an observer's view of the run by the Bucks as he had just left the game with four fouls when the Bucks clicked off the 19-0 rally. ""(It was) our pace,"" he said of the run. ""We were able to get in passing lanes, get some deflections. We made them turn the ball over and we were able to run, create threes, easy looks, easy layups. ""I think Bledsoe did a good job of setting the tone and everybody else followed.""","401071336"
"DALLAS --  Gregg Popovich is glad NBA games are 48 minutes long. His San Antonio Spurs needed every last one Wednesday night. The Spurs spotted the Dallas Mavericks an early 19-point lead, clawed back to even in the fourth quarter, then survived a see-saw finish for a 105-101 victory. Davis Bertans and DeMar DeRozan scored 17 of the Spurs' 30 points in the fourth quarter, with Bertans hitting a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:41 left. The Spurs blew a six-point lead in the final period, but Bertans made his third 3-pointer of the quarter for a 99-96 lead, and San Antonio led the rest of the way. ""We spotted them 12 minutes and didn't really compete, just followed them around,"" said Popovich, whose team was behind 23-4 just eight minutes into the game. ""I thought in the second, third and fourth quarters, we competed."" Bertans finished with 12 points. Six Spurs scored at least 12 points, led by Marco Belinelli's 17. After Bertans' 3, LaMarcus Aldridge scored on a tip shot with 1:07 left to extend the lead to five. Wesley Matthews' 3 brought Dallas within two, but DeRozan hit a 20-footer at the other end and Belinelli sealed it with free throws. DeRozan finished with 14 points and nine assists, scoring or assisting on nine of the Spurs' 12 field goals in the final quarter. ""I get caught up in just trying to find guys while my first natural strength is to score the ball,"" DeRozan said. ""It was on me to be aggressive first and try and score, then make reads from there."" Luka Doncic led Dallas with 25 points, adding eight rebounds and eight assists. He became the first rookie since Stephen Curry in 2010 to score 25 or more points in five straight games. ""Every day I know the league more,"" Doncic said. ""At the end of the day, it's just basketball."" After trailing by 19 during the first half, San Antonio tied it at 80 on Belinelli's driving layup with 11:06 to play. DeRozan gave the Spurs their first lead 27 seconds later, setting up a three-minute stretch in which the lead changed hands seven times. DeRozan hit back-to-back mid-range jumpers for a 94-90 lead, and he fed Aldridge for a dunk that extended the Spurs' advantage to six. Doncic answered with two baskets and an alley-oop pass to DeAndre Jordan that tied it. Dallas has lost five of seven, and three of its last four at home after losing only three of its first 18 at American Airlines Center. The Mavericks are also 0-6 in games without J.J. Barea, who is out for the season after Achilles tendon surgery. SMITH OUT AGAIN Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr. missed his fourth consecutive game amid trade rumors, this time with coach Rick Carlisle saying Smith was sick and away from the arena. Smith missed the previous three games with what was listed as back tightness. Told of a Twitter exchange between Smith and a couple in a restaurant at lunch earlier in the day, Carlisle said, ""I don't have any knowledge of that. My trainer told me he was sick and he's going to be out tonight. I've told you what I'm going to tell you about it."" DONCIC TO DIRK The 19-year-old Doncic assisted on both of 40-year-old Dirk Nowitzki's field goals -- a pair of 3-pointers. They were the first two times Doncic assisted on baskets by Nowitzki.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Trail Blazers big man Jusuf Nurkic finally got his triple-double. Less than a week of coming up just two assists shy of the feat, Nurkic got his first career first triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in Portland's 129-112 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. Nurkic said he wasn't aware he was close until teammate Damian Lillard let him know. ""Dame was like, `one more,' Nurkic said. Lillard got the ball to Nurkic, who it passed back to Lillard, who knocked down a 3-pointer -- giving Nurkic his final assist. When told that Lillard celebrated along with the crowd afterward, Nurkic laughed: ""He's my teammate. My brother. He should."" Lillard himself had 33 points to lead all scorers, and CJ McCollum had 19 points as Portland snapped a two-game losing streak. Nurkic added five blocks and was treated to a standing ovation when he left the game with 2:13 left. Portland finished with 16 3-pointers, led by Lillard with four. Jordan Clarkson had 22 points off the bench for the Cavaliers, who were coming off a 101-95 victory over the Lakers that snapped a 12-game losing streak. The game against the Blazers was the fourth of a six-game trip for the Cavs. The teams combined for only seven turnovers, the fewest in an NBA game since the league began to officially compile the stat in 1970-71. Portland had four and Cleveland finished with three. The Blazers led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter, but Cleveland closed the gap to 112-102 midway through the fourth. It was as close as the Cavs could get. ""I just thought we kind of ran out of gas. They guys did a good job getting us back to within 10 but we just weren't able to sustain it.  When you get down and you have to fight back against a team like this it's tough. On the road you can't dig those types of holes. Not against a good team,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. Portland was back at home after a winless two-game trip at Denver and Sacramento. The Blazers have won 19 at home to lead in the Western Conference. Lillard started despite being listed as questionable going into the game with a right hand strain. It is unknown when he was injured. Lillard opened the game with back-to-back 3-pointers and the Blazers had six 3s in the opening quarter to lead 30-26. Portland finished the first half with 11 3-pointers, while the Cavaliers had just two. Portland led 62-55 at the break. Portland stretched the lead to 70-59 on Jake Layman's 15-foot jumper in the third quarter. Lillard's 3-pointer made it 82-66 midway through the third and Portland went on to lead by as many as 21. Rodney Hood added 20 points for the Cavaliers. ""They're just a well-oiled machine,"" Hood said about the Blazers. ""When I was playing with Utah I played against these guys four times a year. They know what they do. They know what they want to accomplish. They have probably the best scoring backcourt in the league."" Nurkic fell two assists shy of a triple-double last Friday Portland's 127-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The 7-foot Bosnian had 11 points, 11 rebounds and tied career highs with eight assists and six blocks. Portland was without Maurice Harkless for the fifth straight game because of left knee soreness, which has hampered him at times throughout the season. There was no word on how long Harkless might be out. The Cavaliers have been stung by injuries this season. David Nwaba was considered a possibility for Wednesday, but he was held out for a 11th straight game with a left ankle sprain. Larry Nance Jr. missed his fourth game with a right knee sprain.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry stepped back time and again and released the ball from way back. Most of the time with at least one defender in his face, too. ""It's insane what he does,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Curry scored 41 points with nine 3-pointers to become the first player in NBA history to make eight or more 3s in three straight games, and the Golden State Warriors held off the New Orleans Pelicans 147-140 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight win. ""When you get hot like that, you really don't see anything but the rim,"" Curry said. ""You just try to stay on balance and get to your spot, wherever that is. Again, these are shots I work on, I have confidence in them, I know my teammates do."" Pelicans star Anthony Davis went down hard beneath the Warriors basket with 2:22 left but was able to walk off after a few minutes and quickly returned. Davis had 30 points, 18 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks in nearly 41 minutes for New Orleans, coming off a 46-point and 16-rebound gem Monday night despite starting 0 for 5 with just four points in the first quarter. Nikola Mirotic scored 29 points, Jrue Holiday added 25 points and seven assists while Elfrid Payton dished out 12 assists. The Pelicans and Warriors combined for an NBA-record 43 3s, breaking the mark by two that Sacramento and Golden State accomplished Jan. 5 at Golden 1 Center.

Draymond Green had two Curry has 28 3-pointers in his past three games while the Warriors made 18 or more from deep in a franchise-record fourth straight game. The 24 made 3s matched a franchise best. ""The shots that Steph made were not wide-open shots,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They're challenged shots, and he made them."" The two-time MVP scored 23 of his points in the third quarter, hitting four 3s over the final 2:37, as the two-time defending champions rallied, taking a 110-109 lead into the fourth after Andre Iguodala's driving finger roll and ensuing free throw. ""It's once-in-a-generation, once-in-a-lifetime talent,"" said Durant, who could only shake his head in joy. Golden State found its rhythm in the second half playing the second night of a back-to-back. The Warriors won 142-111 at Denver on Tuesday night and this was their lone day at home during a grueling 17-day stretch, with seven of eight games away from the Bay Area. Golden State won't play at Oracle Arena again until Jan. 31. ""I'm more like the director at the YMCA than I am coach. `You guys are shirts and you guys are skins, now go play,"" Kerr said. On Friday at the Clippers, All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins is scheduled to start and make his Warriors debut for his first game in nearly a year since tearing his left Achilles tendon and undergoing surgery. The Warriors were hardly as sharp initially as they were a night earlier, but it would have been tough to match that 51-point opening period at Denver. They hit 10 of their 21 in the first quarter alone Tuesday. This time, Golden State had to chip away at a 17-point first-half deficit. After also losing on Golden State's home floor 131-121 on Oct. 31, the Pelicans have lost 10 of the last 11 and 21 of 23 to the Warriors. New Orleans also lost a 4-1 Western Conference semifinals to Golden State. ""We wouldn't have won this game a month ago. We're at a different place now, I can feel it as a coach,"" Kerr said. ""We're more connected now."" COUSINS CONNECTION Gentry, Kerr's top assistant during the 2015 championship season, offered some helpful insight on Cousins before the Warriors signed him to a one-year contract last summer. ""We had a couple good conversations and it was very helpful in terms of my approach when we did sign DeMarcus,"" Kerr said. Is Gentry curious how Cousins might fit in on a star-studded roster? ""Nope, not really,"" he said. ""He's a great player. He's the best player at his position in the league.""

Donovan Mitchell scored 28 points in Utah's 129-109 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night for its first five-game winning streak of the season. Mitchell, coming off Western Conference player of the week honors, has averaged 30.3 points over his last six games. The Jazz are 8-2 in their last 10, matching Golden State's record as the best in the West over that stretch. ""Nothing's different. We're just a bit more focused,"" Mitchell said. ""We didn't overreact at the beginning of the year. We just knew if we kept being persistent and doing what we do, there'd be no problem."" Jae Crowder added 23 points, Rudy Gobert had 23 points and 22 rebounds for his 37th double-double of the season and Kyle Korver had 19 points for the Jazz, who had six players in double figures. Utah shot 51 percent from the floor. ""Our defense was just god-awful,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""That just can't happen."" Leading by 16 to start the fourth, Utah got three consecutive 3-pointers, two by Korver and one by Mitchell, to go up 104-81. Lou Williams scored 10 of the Clippers' next 13 points to draw them to 107-92. The Jazz made 30 of 37 free throws, while the Clippers were 9 of 14. ""We've been playing pretty good defense and haven't shot the ball as well as we want to and tonight we shot it really well,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Guys were moving the ball and sharing it and finding the open man."" Williams finished with 23 points off the bench to lead the Clippers, who have lost four straight for the second time this season. Tobias Harris added 17 points and Avery Bradley 15 points. ""We had some slippage,"" Williams said. ""Everybody goes through their ruts. You take your lumps and get ready for the next one."" Los Angeles rallied in the second, getting within one on a 3-pointer by Bradley. But Utah answered with an 8-2 run to go into halftime leading 56-49. TIP-INS Jazz: They improved to 8-7 on the road against Western Conference teams. ... The lineup of Mitchell, Royce O'Neale, Joe Ingles, Favors and Gobert improved to 4-0 together. Clippers: Rivers got a technical early in the fourth. ... They also dropped four straight from Dec. 11-17. BIG BLOCK Georges Niang came up with a huge block of Patrick Beverley at the net early in the second. ""It might be the play of the year, so far. I didn't think he was going to get it,"" said O'Neale, who turned and asked Niang if he surprised himself. ""I did, I did,"" Niang replied. ""I thought I was going to get the backboard but then I got the ball.""","401071340"
"LONDON -- Allonzo Trier was called for goaltending on a layup attempt by Thomas Bryant with 0.4 seconds remaining, giving the Washington Wizards a 101-100 victory over the New York Knicks at The O2 Arena on Thursday night. Bradley Beal scored 26 points and had nine rebounds, and Otto Porter Jr. had 20 points and 11 rebounds for the Wizards, who outscored the Knicks 24-11 in the fourth quarter. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 25 points and Luke Kornet finished with 16 points, including 12 in the first quarter, for the Knicks, who lost their fifth consecutive game. New York was making its third appearance in the NBA's annual London game. Washington was there for the first time. Noah Vonleh gave the Knicks the 100-99 edge with a one-handed finish over Bryant with 33.7 seconds left, and a 3-pointer by Beal rimmed out. Kevin Knox tried to run down the clock, but his off-balance 3-point attempt missed the rim and led to a shot-clock violation with 3.3 seconds left. That left Washington with one last opportunity, and Trevor Ariza drove the lane before dumping the ball off to Bryant just before the buzzer. Trier and Mudiay both collapsed on Bryant, who released the ball in time but had his shot swatted away by Trier just after it began its downward trajectory. Mudiay's buzzer-beating heave at the other end off the inbounds play was off target. The Knicks held a 10-point lead after the first quarter and pushed it to 19 in the second before entering halftime up 63-53. New York led by as many as 16 in the third quarter before Washington began to rally. The Wizards reclaimed the lead at 92-91 with 4:34 left on Porter's pull-up jumper. Beal, whose streak of three games with 30 or more points ended, scored only eight points in the first half. The Wizards shot 7 for 27 from 3-point range and had a 51-42 rebounding advantage. TIP-INS Knicks: C Enes Kanter, who is averaging 14.4 points and a team-high 11 rebounds, did not travel with the team for the game because of fears over his safety as an outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ... Rookie C Mitchell Robinson returned after missing 13 games because of a groin injury and finished with four points and two rebounds in 10 minutes. Wizards: Owner Ted Leonsis said before the game that he would ""never, ever tank"" and that Washington, which has reached the playoffs four of the past five seasons, would push to do so again. ""I don't think you can tell a coach, 'Don't try to win,'"" Leonsis said. ""I would never do that.""","401071341"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Coach James Borrego says the Charlotte Hornets can beat any team in the NBA if they bring defensive intensity. The challenge is getting that effort every game. ""That's the message right now,"" Borrego said. ""If we come out and defend with energy, physicality and disruption, we have a shot against anyone."" Kemba Walker scored 23 points, surpassing 11,000 for his career, and the Hornets set the tone with a strong defensive effort in the second quarter and powered their way to a 114-95 win Thursday night over the Sacramento Kings. Miles Bridges and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each had 15 points off the bench and reserve center Willy Hernangomez added 11 points and 16 rebounds for the Hornets. Charlotte's reserves outscored Sacramento's 60-44 and outrebounded them 25-17 as the Kings' three-game winning streak ended. That run included a win over Charlotte in Sacramento on Saturday. ""Their role players struggled a little bit at our place, our role players struggled a little bit here,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""That's generally what happens -- role players play better at home. We're playing a lot of young guys at the same time, so it's going to take a little while to figure out."" The defense and bench play go hand-in-hand for Charlotte. Borrego has been substituting more frequently of late and going deeper into his bench in an effort to save energy for defense. ""We want them to be fresh out there to give us all they have defensively,"" Borrego said. While the first-year coach knows that may cost the Hornets some points on the offensive end, he said it's ""worth the payoff on defense."" Veteran guard Tony Parker agreed, saying if the Hornets want to make a playoff run -- they are currently eighth in the Eastern Conference standings -- they have to do it with defensive energy and consistently strong play off the bench. ""The second unit played well and got us back in the game,"" Parker said. ""But we have to have more consistency and keep it going now."" The Hornets entered the game looking to make up ground in the East after a 2-4 West Coast trip. After falling behind by 13 early, Charlotte outscored Sacramento 43-25 in the second quarter to take control and never trailed again, leading by as many as 20 early in the fourth quarter. Kidd-Gilchrist brought energy in the second quarter, scoring with 13 points before the break -- most of those coming in transition after solid defensive play. In all, the Hornets scored 24 points off 16 Kings turnovers. ""To score 43 points, it speaks to our defense there. That's really how we were scoring,"" Borrego said. ""We were getting stops and steals."" TIP-INS Kings: Buddy Hield led the Kings with 24 points. ... Were outscored 52-38 in the paint despite being the Hornets being without center Cody Zeller. Hornets: Carolina Panthers All-Pro linebacker Luke Kuechly and former teammate Thomas Davis took in the game from courtside seats. ... Center Frank Kaminsky did not play, even with Zeller out. GILES' RETURN North Carolina native Harry Giles capped a frustrating night by fouling out with 1:20 left in the game. He finished with one point after missing all three shots from the field and going 1 of 4 from the foul line. Still, he said it was an ""amazing"" feeling to play in front of so many friends and relatives. ""I wish I could have played a little bit better,"" Giles said. ""They've seen me hoop before so they know, but just personally you always want to do good."" WILLIAMS ON WILLIAMS North Carolina Tar Heels coach Roy Williams made a surprise visit to see former Tar Heels player Marvin Williams play, something he tends to do at least once per season. ""The funny thing is you never know when he's going to pop up,"" Marvin Williams said. ""I've been in the league 14 years now and coach Williams has found a way to make it to a game every year. It's unbelievable. And I know he does that for a lot of his former players -- it's bigger than basketball for him.""","401071342"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  If the Philadelphia 76ers are going to move up in the Eastern Conference standings, they might do it on the strength of their passing. Joel Embiid had 22 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists Thursday night to lead the Sixers to their seventh win in nine games, a 120-96 blowout of the Indiana Pacers. Jimmy Butler added 27 points and eight assists as Philadelphia shot 53 percent and finished with 38 assists, the most by an Indiana opponent this season. ""We had 40 assists the last time we played at home,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We backed that up with 38. To come into Indianapolis and be able to set the table with our defense but also share the ball the way we did, that's a statement we're proud of. That set the table for a good night."" Philadelphia ranks third in the league in assist rate and tops the league with 17 games of at least 30 dimes. Ben Simmons (eight assists), J.J. Redick (five) and T.J. McConnell (five) also showed their passing prowess. ""The fact that it's (spread out) amongst our group, that's a huge statement,"" Brown said. ""I'm proud of us sharing."" In a matchup of two of the top teams in the Eastern Conference, the 76ers improved to 2-1 in the four-game season series. The road team has won all three games. Philadelphia moved within percentage points of Indiana for third place in the East. ""We're learning the offense,"" Simmons said. ""We're learning where guys are without the ball, and we're having fun out there."" Redick contributed 20 points. Indiana's starting backcourt of Darren Collison and All-Star Victor Oladipo was limited to 21 combined points on 9-of-30 shooting. What had been a competitive game turned into a rout in the third quarter. The 76ers led 28-25 after the first quarter and 54-48 at halftime, but a quick 8-0 run put them up 66-55 and prompted Pacers coach Nate McMillan to call timeout. Redick hit two 3-pointers assisted by handoffs from Embiid, and Embiid scored in the lane during the burst. T.J. McConnell's driving bank shot in the final seconds of the quarter pushed the lead to 15 for the first time. Philadelphia carried that 86-71 advantage to the fourth. Redick's sixth 3 made it an 18-point lead. Indiana replied with a 10-0 run, but back-to-back 3s from Embiid and his backup, Mike Muscala, quieted the crowd and forced yet another Indiana timeout. Muscala had 11 points and seven rebounds. Indiana, held to 40 percent shooting, never challenged again. Ex-Sixer Thaddeus Young had 27 points and six rebounds. Oladipo ended up with 15 points and seven assists. ""From start to finish, they ran their stuff, passed and scored,"" Oladipo said. ""Their big dogs were big. It should be a wake-up call for us."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid was third and Butler fifth among Eastern Conference frontcourt players in fan votes for the All-Star Game when the league announced the third set of ballot returns Thursday. Simmons was fourth among guards. ... Listed as questionable to play because of back tightness, Embiid stretched on a foam roller during one rest. Pacers: Reggie Miller, back where he played his entire 18-year NBA career, served as an analyst on TNT's broadcast and toured the Pacers' new practice facility near Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Miller ranks second on the NBA's career 3-point list at 2,560, though Stephen Curry is on his heels at 2,313. ... Oladipo was fifth among East guards in All-Star voting as of Thursday.","401071343"
"TORONTO --  The Phoenix Suns figured Toronto guard Kyle Lowry was going to take the decisive shot. Pascal Siakam and the Raptors had other plans. Siakam scored the winning basket just before time expired, leading the Raptors to a 111-109 victory over the Suns on Thursday night. Serge Ibaka put Toronto up 109-107 on a hook shot with 47 seconds left, but Mikal Bridges tied it with a pair of free throws with 13 seconds remaining. Toronto gave the ball to Siakam, who let the clock wind down before driving for a left-handed layup that bounced off the backboard and fell through the rim as the buzzer sounded. The basket was confirmed following a video review. ""I always feel I can get to the rim,"" Siakam said. ""I just felt like I had an advantage, just long strides and try to get there. The big came up to help, but it was kind of too late."" Siakam had 10 points and 12 rebounds as Toronto extended its home winning streak to eight. ""I just thought he could beat somebody off the dribble,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""He made a great move and he finished it off."" Siakam's winner wasn't quite what Phoenix was expecting. ""We were surprised,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Personally, I was thinking Lowry was going to take the last shot. Siakam made a big play for his team."" Ibaka scored 22 points and Lowry had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors, who have won six of seven overall. Devin Booker scored 30 points, Deandre Ayton had 15 points and 17 rebounds, and Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 18 for the Suns. Fred VanVleet had 15 points and C.J. Miles returned after missing three of the previous four games because of a sore right hip to score 13. Kawhi Leonard (rest) sat as the Raptors played the second game of a back-to-back. Lowry was originally expected to rest, but told Nurse he wanted to play as he works his way back into shape after missing time with a sore back. Phoenix was up 78-77 to begin the fourth, but Toronto took the lead at 88-87 when the Suns' Josh Jackson fouled Toronto's Chris Boucher on a dunk with 7:50 to go. Jackson argued the call and was ejected after picking up his second technical foul. After video review, the foul on Boucher was ruled flagrant. Toronto made both of its foul shots and got the ball back, with Lowry hitting a 3 to put the Raptors up 95-87. ""I felt it was my job to step up and say something for my teammates,"" Jackson said. ""I felt like somebody should have got a technical foul because that was just ridiculous."" Kokoskov said the Suns need to do a better job of maintaining their composure in key moments. ""To beat a team like Toronto on their court, you almost have to play a perfect game, and we didn't,"" he said. Phoenix trailed 57-49 at halftime. TIP-INS Suns: Jackson scored seven points in 19 minutes before being ejected. ... G Jamal Crawford (left knee) missed his second straight game. ... Phoenix F Quincy Acy was a second round pick by Toronto in 2012. ... The Suns are 4-18 on the road. ... Ayton's career-high in rebounds is 18. Raptors: F OG Anunoby missed his second straight game for personal reasons. ... Toronto is 12-5 against Western Conference opponents. ... G Patrick McCaw made his Toronto debut, going scoreless in six minutes. He signed with the Raptors last Thursday. MILESTONE MOMENT Lowry finished with eight assists, giving him 5,002 for his career. He's one of 10 active players to reach the mark. ""He really commands the offense and knows where to get it,"" Nurse said. Lowry joins Jose Calderon, Raymond Felton, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Dwyane Wade, John Wall and Russell Westbrook. ""It's a great stepping stone for my individual, personal career,"" Lowry said. SETTING SUNS Toronto swept the season series against Phoenix in consecutive years for the first time in franchise history. BACK-TO-BACKS The Raptors are an NBA-best 8-1 in the second game of back-to-backs this season. This was their ninth of 12 such sets.","401071344"
"DENVER --  The pledge from Jamal Murray: More effort. The promise from Nikola Jokic: More aggressiveness. It added up to just the sort of confidence-restoring, bounce-back performance the Denver Nuggets needed. Murray scored 22 of his 25 points in the third quarter, Jokic finished two rebounds shy of another triple-double and the Nuggets cruised past Chicago 135-105 on Thursday night for their 12th straight home win over the Bulls. ""This was the response we were all hoping for,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. On Tuesday, the Nuggets were drubbed 142-111 by Golden State in a matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference. So before Thursday's game, Malone challenged his team. More specifically, Murray and Jokic. ""I asked Nikola, `What are you going to give us tonight?' He said, `I'm going to be aggressive,"" Malone recounted. ""I asked Jamal, `What are you going to give us tonight?' He said, `I'm going to play with great effort.' I thought those guys did that."" The tandem had big nights and didn't even see the floor in the fourth quarter. Murray was feeling it during his third-quarter spurt, hitting six shots from 3-point range. ""Everyone knows once I make one or two, that's all I need,"" Murray said. ""After that, I'm locked in."" Jokic did a little bit of everything, finishing with 18 points and 11 assists. He had a move where he went around the waist with the ball to avoid a defender and drew a foul while making the shot. That kicked up chants of ""M-V-P!"" He helped the Nuggets overcome a sluggish start and actually lead by as many as 40 points. ""We needed to wake up to try to play like we were supposed to play, not just this game but every game,"" Jokic said. ""When we got to the other gear, we played the right way."" Another rough night for the Bulls, who haven't knocked off the Nuggets at the Pepsi Center since Feb. 8, 2006. The Bulls also remain winless in 2019, with their losing streak stretching to nine in a row. ""We're just trying to keep our head up,"" said Lauri Markkanen, who scored 27 as his team that finished up a fruitless five-game trip. ""Obviously, it's tough to keep losing. But no one is going to feel sorry for us, and like I've said before on this road trip, we've just got to work through it and that's all we can do. But yes, it is frustrating."" The Nuggets showed no residual effects from the lopsided loss to the Warriors, in which they allowed an NBA-record, 51-point first quarter. Denver picked up the defensive intensity from the start and limited the Bulls to 47 points at halftime. Just the sort of defensive effort Malone wanted to see. ""Everybody contributed,"" Malone said. ""A great response."" TIP-INS Bulls: Rookie C Wendell Carter Jr. was ruled out with a sprained left thumb. He's day to day. ... G Zach LaVine was held to eight points, well below his average of 23.2. Nuggets: G Will Barton missed the game for personal reasons. ... Denver hit a season-high 20 3-pointers. GOOD DEFENSE Bulls coach Jim Boylen took a ""charge"" late in the first quarter, when Torrey Craig fell on top of him after tumbling out of bounds. The ball was awarded to Chicago. TOE-TO-TOE Denver forward Paul Millsap said his fractured right big toe is ""feeling good."" The proof may have been on his dunk in the first quarter. He finished with 14 points. ""Feeling pretty bouncy,"" Millsap said. ""It's feeling refreshed. I may go get a pedicure."" LOOK WHO'S BACK Nuggets guard Gary Harris returned after missing five games with hamstring tightness and scored 14 points in nearly 19 minutes. ""He's probably our most consistent players,"" Malone said. STEPPING UP Boylen appreciated Kris Dunn taking accountability for his less-than-stellar play in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier in the week. Dunn had six points and five turnovers against the Lakers. ""He took it on the chest that he's got to play better for us to be successful,"" Boylen said of Dunn, who had six points against Denver. ""What we're striving for is to play better basketball and to own the `Bulls' across our chest.""","401071345"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The young Los Angeles Lakers matured on Thursday night. With four-time MVP LeBron James still sidelined by a left groin strain, Kyle Kuzma scored 32 points to help the Lakers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 138-128 in overtime. James missed his 12th straight game, yet against a veteran team loaded with All-Star talent, the Lakers rolled to a 16-6 advantage in the extra period. ""That was a really nice, big win for our group,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We got contributions from everybody. This is a really hard place to win at. It's a playoff team. For our guys to keep coming in and different people making plays -- it's how we have to compete."" Ivica Zubac scored a career-high 26 points and Lonzo Ball added 18 points and 10 assists for the Lakers, who improved to 5-7 without their injured star. Paul George scored 27 points and Terrance Ferguson added 21 for Oklahoma City. Russell Westbrook had 26 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds but shot just 7 of 30. The Thunder lost despite making a franchise-record 21 3-pointers and leading by 17 in the first half. They have dropped five of six. Westbrook missed two layups in the final minute but was fouled by Ball on a 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds remaining and the Lakers up 122-119. Westbrook, a 64 percent free throw shooter, made all three foul shots to tie the score. Kuzma missed a 3 at the buzzer, and the game went to overtime. NBA crew chief Tom Washington acknowledged that Westbrook should never have been awarded free throws. ""Upon being able to see the review of the play, we realized that the illegal contact happened prior to his upward motion, so it should have been a side-out,"" Washington said. Ball took responsibility for the situation. ""It's my fault that he hit the free throws,"" he said. ""Maybe I should have fouled him earlier. But I had to wash it off."" Ball bounced back with five points, two rebounds and an assist in overtime. Walton was impressed with his second-year point guard's overall effort, especially late in the game. ""For him to do that against Westbrook -- I'm sure a player he watched growing up as one of the great point guards in our league -- not only to score those points, but a couple of big assists to Zu coming down the lane, a big-time rebound. He can do a little bit of everything,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Lakers: G Rajon Rondo missed his 11th straight game since having surgery on his ring finger. ... F Michael Beasley tried to check into the game in the first quarter while wearing practice shorts. ... The Lakers made their first 11 free throws. ... F Brandon Ingram had a career-high 11 assists. Thunder: Backup center Nerlens Noel returned after sitting out three games while in concussion protocol. ... G Alex Abrines has missed the past eight games for personal reasons. ... Ferguson shot 5 of 6 on 3-pointers in the first half. ... G Raymond Felton was called for a technical foul in overtime while on the bench. STAT LINES The Thunder attempted a franchise-record 54 3-pointers, shattering the previous mark of 44 set last season against Denver. FADING DEFENSE The Thunder, among the best defensive teams in the league during the first half of the season, have allowed an average of 130.2 points in their past six games. ""Just slight lack of awareness,"" Noel said. ""Things like backdoors, small things. I think we just have to do a better job of guarding the ball 1-on-1."" HE SAID IT Walton on Zubac's performance: ""He was big around the rim and he has a really nice, soft touch down there. Some of it is his teammates looking for him. But when he gets that ball around the rim, he's pretty good at finishing. But where he's really grown is at becoming more physical.""","401071346"
"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving's 20-point third quarter wasn't quite enough for the Boston Celtics to put away the Memphis Grizzlies. The star guard scored eight more in the fourth, finishing with 38 points and 11 assists while leading the Celtics to a 122-116 victory Friday night. ""He was able to pick his spots and make plays,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""I thought it was a patient, really good, smart attack by him."" Marcus Smart had 20 points and Al Horford finished with 18 for the Celtics, who have won two straight behind Irving since a three-game skid. ""You're playing a team that has a ton of offensive firepower. They have one of the best shot-makers in the game and it's difficult to get stops when he's in his rhythm,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""I thought our guys defended him well but he just made shots, and give him credit for that."" Memphis has lost four in a row and 10 of 11 overall. Boston beat the Grizzlies for the seventh consecutive time but had to hang on down the stretch. Memphis trailed only 111-108 with 3:13 left, but the Celtics responded with a 10-2 run. A few late 3-pointers by the Grizzlies came too late. ""They're physical. They make you work and they are always in the right spots at the right time. It took a whole group effort tonight,"" Smart said. Mike Conley led the Grizzlies with 26 points. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 23, and Marc Gasol had 11 rebounds and 12 assists. Boston led 96-91 after three, but the pesky Grizzlies would not go away. Conley's three-point play with 4:53 remaining pulled Memphis to 106-104. Irving finally sealed it when he hit a 3 with 1:22 left to put the Celtics up 118-110. ""We couldn't get a stop the last four minutes of the game. You don't get stops, it's going to be really hard to win. It comes down to that,"" Gasol said. Jaylen Brown had 12 points and Terry Rozier scored 10 for Boston. Rozier hit a 3 to start an 11-0 run that put the Celtics up 35-24 after the first quarter. Then he made another from beyond the arc while drawing a foul and converted the four-point play. The Grizzlies rallied late in the period, tying it 52-all on a layup by JaMychal Green and taking a 62-58 halftime lead on Conley's layup just before the buzzer. KYRIE IS KEY Irving, who had 27 points and 18 assists Wednesday night in a win over Toronto, also added seven rebounds as the Celtics outrebounded the Grizzlies 52-39. ""It means a lot. It's big for us,"" Smart said of Irving's all-around performance the last two games. ""You're going to get open shots just because he draws so much attention. That helps our team."" MEMPHIS BLUES The Grizzlies have lost six straight on the road, but did enjoy a solid shooting night. Memphis was 41 for 92 from the field and made 16 of 35 3-pointers, including a team-best 4 for 9 by Conley from beyond the arc. The Grizzlies also had 33 assists -- four more than the Celtics -- and turned the ball over just twice in the second half. ""This is what we're capable of,"" Bickerstaff said. ""If we make 16 3s every night, I don't know if that will happen, but just the way that we moved the ball, created for one another, we need to build on it for sure.""

"DETROIT --  Dwane Casey wants the Detroit Pistons to react a little better when they hit a rough stretch. Friday night against Miami was another test. Blake Griffin had 32 points and 11 rebounds, and the Pistons overcame an early exit by injured Andre Drummond to beat the Heat 98-93. Detroit blew a 16-point lead and scored only 12 in the third quarter, but the Pistons rebounded in the fourth and have won consecutive games for the first time since early December. ""We've got to stop dropping our shoulders, dropping our head, or letting whatever is bothering us, bother us,"" said Casey, in his first season as Detroit's coach. ""Whether it's officials -- whatever it is, we've got to get to the next play, and we're going to be a better team for it."" Dwyane Wade scored 20 points for the Heat, but missed badly on an off-balance 3-pointer in the final seconds that could have tied the game. Detroit led by 16 in the first half and was up 53-39 at halftime, but the Pistons were down by four by the time the third period was over. Luke Kennard scored eight points in the fourth to help them pull through. Drummond left with a nasal injury after being hit in the face in the first quarter by the arm of Miami's James Johnson. Drummond finished with no points in 7:14, and backup Zaza Pachulia scored only two -- on a tip-in that put Detroit up 94-91 with 26.7 seconds remaining. Casey said Drummond had a nasal contusion and will be re-evaluated Saturday morning. The Heat were done in by their abysmal foul shooting. They went 5 of 19 at the line, with center Hassan Whiteside missing all eight of his attempts. ""We work on them all the time. Maybe we should stop working on them,"" coach Eric Spoelstra said. ""Hassan works on them as hard as anyone, and he's got good technique. He's had stretches like this before and he'll get it back."" Kennard scored 22 points for the Pistons, and Reggie Bullock added 19. Griffin finished an assist shy of a triple-double. Detroit beat Golden State on Dec. 1 to cap a five-game winning streak. The Pistons, who defeated Orlando on Wednesday, have won back-to-back games for the first time since then. TRIBUTE Wade received a nice ovation when he checked into the game in the first quarter, and a message went up on the scoreboard congratulating him on his career. This is Wade's final NBA season, and the Heat won't come to Detroit again unless the teams meet in the playoffs. ""It was cool to get that kind of love here, because we had a lot of great battles with the Pistons,"" Wade said. ""I wasn't surprised, though. The people here have always been good to me, even when it was a rivalry."" MOVING ON? Dion Waiters scored two points in 8:37 for Miami. The Heat fined Waiters an undisclosed amount for expletive-laden comments about playing time earlier this week. He played 11:56 on Tuesday in a 38-point loss at Milwaukee. LOOKING TO SHOOT Kennard went 8 of 17 in a reserve role. It was his third straight game with at least 10 points. ""You get open shots when you play hard, when you play fast,"" Kennard said. ""I think that has been helping me out a little bit."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami was without G Josh Richardson (illness).

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  This winning thing has become a habit for the Brooklyn Nets -- and apparently no deficit is too large to overcome lately. D'Angelo Russell matched his career high with 40 points and the Brooklyn Nets came back after trailing by as many as 21 points to beat the Orlando Magic 117-115 on Friday night. ""If the media wasn't in here, we'd be screaming and yelling, playing music and dancing,"" said center Jarrett Allen after the Nets' 16th win in 21 games. ""That was so great. It's not every day you see a team coming back from 21 points down. ... When you start winning games like this, it definitely changes your personality."" Russell's 3-pointer with 27.1 seconds left put the Nets up for the first time since they went ahead 2-0 in the game's first minute. After missed free throws by both teams left Brooklyn with a two-point lead, Evan Fournier missed a shot in the lane that would have tied it for Orlando. The Nets also rallied Wednesday night from an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit in a 145-142 overtime victory at Houston. ""We've got a great group of guys with the same goals and that's what we're starting to notice,"" said Russell, who shot 8 of 12 from 3-point range and did not attempt a free throw. ""We're all buying in and we're all hanging on each other's success. It's a great feeling."" The Nets made 19 of 46 3-point shots and are now in sixth place in the Eastern Conference after being 10 games under .500 in early December. At 24-23, New Jersey is above .500 after 47 games for the first time since the 2012-13 season. Aaron Gordon scored 23 points for Orlando, and Nikola Vucevic added 16 points and 17 rebounds. The Magic, who have lost six of eight, shot 50 percent but made only 10 3-pointers. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half for Brooklyn. The Magic made 11 of their first 15 shots in the second quarter to take a 58-37 lead. Russell made five 3-pointers in a span of less than four minutes to shoot the Nets back in the game, and they held Orlando to one field goal over the final 4:50. ""I thought Orlando dominated us for 95 percent of the game,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I thought in the fourth quarter we started to play some defense and D'Angelo was huge. We didn't play a great game, but we pulled it out anyway."" Dinwiddie and Shabazz Napier sparked a second-half rally after the Nets had fallen behind 86-68 midway through the third quarter. Orlando led 100-89 after Gordon hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter, but the Magic couldn't hit shots at the end. ""I thought our last four shots were good,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""If you're going to win a game like this, you're going to make a couple of them. And the ball didn't go down."" GORDON SITS OUT FINAL 9:19 Gordon went to the bench with a stiff back with 9:19 remaining and never returned. ""I'm going to just rest as much as I can tonight and see how it feels tomorrow,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can go (against Milwaukee). We'll see how it goes when I wake up, but right now it's tough to move it."" It was Orlando's first loss in eight games in which Gordon scored 22 points or more. TIP-INS Nets: The Nets have won six straight close games (decided by three points or less). ... Russell scored the Nets' final 19 points of the first half. ... Atkinson called a timeout 81 seconds into the game after two Orlando dunks. Magic: Rookie C Mo Bamba had nine points and four rebounds after missing four games with a sore left foot. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Under coach Gregg Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs have been consistent winners. That includes when they go on the road -- and anywhere they play the Minnesota Timberwolves. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 25 points, Rudy Gay added 22 and the Spurs held on to give Popovich another milestone victory in a 116-113 win against the Timberwolves on Friday night. Popovich earned his 520th career win on the road, tying Pat Riley for the most in NBA history. ""We got through some stuff and it's always good to win on the road,"" Popovich said. ""It's always difficult to do, but when you do it feels pretty good."" The win also continued San Antonio's mastery of Minnesota. The Spurs have won 16 of the past 18 games between the teams. San Antonio is 59-25 in the series since Popovich took over as coach for the 1996-97 season. Marco Belinelli added 19 points off the bench for San Antonio, which played without leading scorer DeMar DeRozan because of left ankle soreness. ""Coach Pop said don't think about it and play basketball, and we've got to win the game no matter what,"" forward Davis Bertans said. Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points for the Timberwolves but fouled out after only 21 minutes. Derrick Rose chipped in 23 points and Taj Gibson added 14 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota. Another matchup between the familiar foes was tight throughout, with 27 lead changes and 17 ties. It also featured a heavy dose of fouls on both sides. The teams combined for 53 personal fouls and 67 free throws. ""We're a no-excuse team,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""We made our own mistakes at times. We had opportunities to win. So, there's nothing on the officials."" Towns picked up his fourth foul less than two minutes into the second half, and again went to the bench. Josh Okogie had six points and Jeff Teague added five as Minnesota used a 14-1 run to take a 77-67 lead. The Spurs responded with a 13-2 spurt of their own as Bertans hit a pair of 3-pointers. ""We had a 10-point lead. We didn't close out the show,"" Towns said. ""We didn't do what we needed to do to come out with a win. That's the disappointing thing about tonight. That's our next step in maturation of our team."" The Wolves led 90-88 to start the fourth, but Bertans opened the quarter with another 3. San Antonio led by seven in the fourth, but Minnesota clawed back within one with 30.3 seconds left on Rose's layup. Belinelli hit two free throws and Rose's 3 at the buzzer was off the mark.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah's resurgent ability to take over a game on defense is once again turning the Jazz into a difficult matchup for NBA teams. It showed in a 115-99 victory over Cleveland on Friday night. The Cavaliers hung around for barely a quarter before the Jazz imposed their will on defense. Utah forced Cleveland into bad shots, got into transition and kept the Cavaliers off the glass when it mattered. Ultimately, Cleveland (9-37) shot just 21 of 68 (.309) from the field over the first three quarters. It opened the door for Utah (26-21) to claim its sixth straight win and eighth in nine games. ""It's the same team we were last year,"" Donovan Mitchell said. ""The same team that came in and was aggressive on defense."" Mitchell shined in his temporary point guard role once again, scoring 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting. Rudy Gobert added 19 points and 15 rebounds. Royce O'Neale and Derrick Favors also finished with double-doubles, with O'Neale totaling 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Favors 12 points and 10 boards. The Jazz dominated around the paint for four quarters. They finished with a 48-37 advantage in rebounds and outscored the Cavaliers 60-44 in the paint and 11-4 in second-chance points. ""We became too stagnant and played into the heart of their defense,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""With a shot blocker like Gobert, you can't just play 1-on-1 basketball. The ball has to move. We have to move our bodies."" Ante Zizic and Collin Sexton each scored 15 points for the Cavaliers. Zizic added 10 rebounds to get his first career double-double. Cameron Payne had 14 off the bench. Cleveland took its only lead at 7-6 when Cedi Osman stole a pass from Jae Crowder and set Sexton up for a layup. Utah surged ahead for good on back-to-back 3-pointers from Mitchell and O'Neale that sparked a 12-4 run. Gobert finished it off with a dunk off a lob pass from Mitchell, giving Utah an 18-11 lead. The Cavaliers closed within two at 20-18 on a pair of free throws from Payne. Utah then got going from the perimeter near the end of the first quarter and put the game out of reach. Joe Ingles, Crowder, Kyle Korver, and Grayson Allen rattled off four 3-pointers over four straight possessions spanning the first and second quarters. Their outside baskets gave the Jazz a 32-20 lead. It sparked a second quarter during which Utah hit 12 of 20 shots and held Cleveland to just five total baskets. The Jazz capped it with back-to-back baskets from Gobert and O'Neale to take a 61-37 halftime lead. ""We didn't force anything,"" Crowder said. ""Those guys were doing a good job of going under on pick-and-rolls and shrinking the court as much as possible, trying to take away Rudy's lobs and things like that. Guys stepped into shots. It was just a matter of us hitting them and it definitely gave us momentum."" The Cavaliers could not keep up with the Jazz after missing their first 12 3-point shot attempts. They didn't score an outside basket until Jordan Clarkson knocked one down with 1:34 left before halftime. Utah didn't ease up after halftime, extending its lead to as many as 38 points in the third quarter, going up 87-49 on another 3-pointer from Crowder. BACK IN TOWN Rodney Hood and Alec Burks both played their first games in Utah since being traded by the Jazz. Hood went to Cleveland in a trade that brought Crowder to the Jazz a year ago. Burks was shipped out to the Cavaliers by Utah in exchange for Korver earlier this season. It ended up being a tough night back in Salt Lake City for Hood and Burks. The duo combined for 10 points on 4-of-17 shooting. Burks made his first two shots before missing eight of his final nine. Hood scored his lone basket in the second quarter. The Jazz put up photos of both players with a banner that said `Welcome Back' in the visitors' locker room before the game. ""They showed me a lot of love,"" Burks said. ""I was here for 7 1/2 years and they showed their love for me and I appreciate that."" O'NEALE STEPPING UP After making a big splash as an undrafted free agent a year ago, O'Neale is proving his worth again. The second-year forward is averaging 10.2 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 2.6 assists since moving into the starting lineup five games ago. Against the Cavaliers, he was active on the glass and in transition. It helped O'Neale notch his first double-double of the season. ""That's the effort (we) see all the time,"" Mitchell said. ""He's really proven himself. He's doing really well throughout this stretch with guys hurt."" TIP INS Cavaliers: Tristan Thompson did not play because of left foot soreness. ... Cleveland scored 19 points off 19 Jazz turnovers. ... Payne has scored in double figures four of his last six games. ... The Cavaliers set a season high with 39 fourth-quarter points. Jazz: Mitchell is averaging 29.0 points per game over his last eight games and has scored at least 24 points in each contest. ... Ingles totaled a team-high eight assists.

"DeMarcus Cousins express his emotions on returning to basketball for the first time since his Achilles injury last year. (1:17) LOS ANGELES --  DeMarcus Cousins couldn't wipe the smile off his face. The usually scowling big man was back Friday night after being sidelined for nearly a year. He scored 14 points in his Warriors debut, a 112-94 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. ""I felt like a kid on Christmas,"" Cousins said. ""This was probably one of the best days of my life being back on the floor playing the game that I love."" His new teammates were glad to have him, too, even if he lasted just 15 minutes before fouling out. They gave him a standing ovation when he got whistled for his sixth foul at 8:51 of the fourth. Cousins smiled and high-fived his way to the bench. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant cracked up. ""Probably the fakest love I ever received in my life,"" Cousins said. Durant said: ""Hopefully that's the last time we give him a standing ovation when he fouls out."" Curry led the Warriors with 28 points, Durant added 24 and Golden State won its seventh in a row and sixth straight on the road. The Warriors shot just 9 of 37 on 3-pointers on a night when Curry made only three from long range. Fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson missed all four of his 3-point attempts. The hours leading up to his first game since Jan. 26, 2018, were the worst for Cousins. He texted friends and talked to his brother and sister who reminded him that he's been playing basketball for years. Still, it wasn't until the ball tipped that the butterflies went away. ""My teammates made it as smooth and easy as possible,"" Cousins said. ""It's a great group of guys. Nothing but love in the room."" Cousins shot 5 for 11 from the floor and finished with six rebounds and three assists. After rupturing his left Achilles tendon in a game for New Orleans he missed the rest of last season, including nine playoff games for the Pelicans. The Warriors signed him last July. With Cousins finally in the lineup, Golden State became the first team in 42 years to start five All-Stars from the previous season. ""We haven't really practiced together,"" Cousins said. ""We can get a whole lot better. We've got a lot of potential."" Cousins missed his first shot but came right back with a one-handed slam off Durant's bounce pass for the Warriors' first basket. Cousins was called for two fouls in the first three minutes and sat down. ""I'm just glad to know I can still dunk,"" he said. ""That felt good."" Cousins picked up his third foul 32 seconds into the second quarter. Then he hit a 3-pointer for the Warriors' first basket of the period, bringing loud cheers from their many fans at Staples Center. Curry scored 14 of Golden State's 29 points in the third, including their final eight for an 81-72 lead. Cousins went out with a bang. He got his fifth foul just 30 seconds into the fourth and then made two consecutive 3-pointers -- throwing up three fingers -- that extended the Warriors' lead to 87-72. ""He looked good. He looked strong and quick,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""I was really impressed."" Tobias Harris led the short-handed Clippers with 28 points in their season-worst fifth straight loss. Rookie guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander tied his career high with 24. Los Angeles played without injured Lou Williams, and Danilo Gallinari left with lower back spasms. ""The change of the game was in the third quarter. Them scoring off our turnovers changed the momentum of the game for us,"" Harris said. The Warriors took their first double-digit lead in the first four minutes of the third when the Clippers missed their initial six shots. Golden State opened on a 14-2 run with five different players scoring, including a basket by Cousins before getting his fourth foul, to go up 66-53. Draymond Green got two technical fouls in the second quarter, the second one for swinging from the basket after a high-flying dunk that sent the Warriors into halftime leading 52-51. TIP-INS Warriors: They're in LA for five days. ""I unpacked my bag for the first time ever on a road trip,"" said Kerr, who plans to catch up with friends from San Diego during the down time. ...

Boston's Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek started two games together that season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. HE SAID IT ""I said, `Good for him.'

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Giving up 20 points in a quarter to a reserve forward may have been just the thing to let New Orleans Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry air his many grievances with his team's defense. Damian Lillard scored 22 points and eight assists to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 128-112 win over the Pelicans on Friday night. CJ McCollum and reserve forward Jake Layman each had 20 points for Portland. Layman got all his scoring in the second quarter. Anthony Davis finished with 27 points and seven rebounds for New Orleans. Jrue Holiday had 20 points and Julius Randle added 19. Gentry was unhappy with the Trail Blazers' defensive effort. New Orleans came in ranked 25th in defensive rating. ""We've got to do better defensively,"" Gentry said. ""Every night it's 130, 140, 147, we're not going to win games until we're able to guard somebody. We've got to be able to defend and we're not doing it."" For Gentry, the problem for the Pelicans is simple. ""It's keeping your man in front of you and if you can't do it, we gotta find someone who can,"" he said. ""We just can't keep having guys drop to the basket and lay it in. We can't have a guy come in and get 20 points and laugh at us while he's doing it. At some stage, you've gotta have pride in what you're doing."" The urgency for Gentry is kicking in as the Pelicans fell to 21-25, four games out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Davis, who hurt his hand in the fourth quarter, did not speak to reporters. Portland opened things up in the second thanks to their reserves, most notably the scoring from Layman. In the span of 2 1/2 minutes, the Moda Center became a playground-like scene. Layman scored 11 points in six Portland possessions as the crowd stood up and the Blazers force-fed him the ball, helping them push their lead as high as 17. After the game, Lillard joked that Layman scored ""all"" of Portland's 74 first quarter points. ""The basket looked big,"" Layman said. ""You just throw it up there and it goes in."" ""When he gets hot, he's a live wire,"" Blazers forward Evan Turner said of Layman. The Blazers also had 23 second chance points thanks to 18 offensive rebounds. The Blazers quickly got their lead up to 21 in the third quarter, with Lillard scoring 10 points in the period. New Orleans, which trailed by 18 going into the fourth, got a push from its reserves to pull within eight with under eight minutes remaining. A 3-point play by McCollum pushed the lead back to 11, which helped get the Blazers back on track with 7:37 left. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans has struggled with injuries, but one of the key contributors is getting healthier. It's only been nine days since forward Nikola Mirotic was cleared to return to action after missing 12 straight games in December and early January. Gentry told reporters before the game that he's not monitoring Mirotic's minutes anymore. ""I think when he first came back, you want to be a little cautious on it,"" Gentry said. ""I don't plan on playing him 38 minutes or anything but I don't have to look at anything and say he's at 25 minutes, uh oh."" Trail Blazers: With a backcourt featuring two scoring guards, questions about the defense are frequent. But lately, they've been quite stingy. Over the last 10 games, the Blazers have been fourth in defensive rating. Coach Terry Stotts likes the team's consistency on that end. ""Part of it is we've been playing teams with poor records but we've still stayed consistent with it,"" Stotts said. ""We've been pretty locked in on scouting reports and tendencies and their plays and things like that. But over the last 11-12 games, statistically we've been pretty good.""","401071353"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid tangled once again. Then Paul George stole the show. George converted a four-point play with 5.1 seconds left, sending Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 117-115 victory over Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. George's clutch shot capped a wild finish that included another memorable moment in the rivalry between Westbrook and Embiid. Westbrook absorbed a hard foul from Embiid on a break with 1:46 left, landing out of bounds under the basket. Westbrook then got up and rushed toward Embiid before he was restrained by his teammates. ""I don't think he just landed on me,"" Westbrook said. ""He had a little extra to it, you know what I'm saying? But it's ok."" Embiid had a different opinion of the play. ""I think I was going for the block and I think he lost the ball, but I was already in the air,"" Embiid said. ""I don't know what, why he was mad. I have no idea. But he's always in his feelings, so I have no idea."" Westbrook and Embiid have had a couple chilly exchanges over the past couple years. Asked if he was ""cool"" with Embiid, Westbrook used an expletive before saying ""No."" Westbrook fouled out with 14.9 seconds remaining after he got Embiid while shooting a 3-pointer. Embiid made all three foul shots, tying it at 113, and Jimmy Butler's driving layup put Philadelphia in front with 6.9 seconds to go. But George drained a 3 while being fouled by Butler and made the foul shot. ""That's PG,"" Westbrook said. ""You don't get too excited anymore about those I mean they happen so many times. PG's doing what PG does and we just got to see it and get a win."" Philadelphia had one last chance, but Butler missed a 3-point attempt in the final seconds. The 76ers have lost 19 in a row to the Thunder. That streak that was on Embiid's mind when he decided to play after he was a game-time decision because of back tightness. ""The Sixers haven't won against them in like 10, 11 years,"" Embiid said. ""That's just ridiculous."" George finished with 31 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Westbrook had 21 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for Oklahoma City, and reserve Dennis Schroder also scored 21 points. The Thunder had dropped five of six, including a 138-128 overtime loss against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. Embiid had 31 points, eight rebounds and six assists. JJ Redick scored 22 points for Philadelphia, and Ben Simmons finished with 20 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists. Oklahoma City led by as many as 16 points in the first quarter, but Philadelphia rallied in the second and trailed 59-56 at the break. BOUNCE BACK GAME The Thunder were glad to leave Philadelphia with the win. ""We lost the last two games, so it was pretty tough,"" center Steven Adams said. ""It was just good. It's obviously good to get a win under our belt, just against this team, obviously they had a lot of really good sets."" BIG PICTURE Thunder: George went 4 for 9 from 3-point range. He also went 11 for 11 at the free-throw line. ... Adams had 16 points and nine rebounds. Terrance Ferguson added 11 points. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Coach James Borrego has been preaching defense to his Charlotte Hornets the last two weeks. But on Saturday the Hornets turned up the heat on the other end of the court, getting off to a blistering start and matching a season high in points scored in a 135-115 win over the Phoenix Suns. All-Star hopeful Kemba Walker led a balanced scoring attack with 21 points, Jeremy Lamb hit five three-pointers and had 18 points as the Hornets won their third straight game. Charlotte shot 54.5 percent from the field and made 16 of 34 3-point attempts in the wire-to-wire victory. ""It started with our defense,"" Lamb said. ""We got stops and were able to get out in transition and get some easy ones. And we moved the ball well tonight."" Charlotte had 31 assists -- six each by Lamb and Nic Batum -- much to the delight of Borrego. ""Our ball movement was great,"" Borrego said. ""When we move the ball like that we are a dangerous offense."" Devin Booker had 32 points and 11 assists for the Suns. They have lost 10 of their last 12 and fell to 4-19 on the road. This one was never close. The Hornets raced to a 29-11 lead, making 10 of 14 shots from the field behind the backcourt duo of Walker and Lamb. They combined for 18 points in the quarter on 7-of-10 shooting. Charlotte extended its lead to 23 by the end of the third quarter. ""Yeah, they just hit us right in the mouth,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""It was their first punch right to the head. By the time we figured out what was going on, we were down 20 (points). .. Every cut they were making, screens they were setting, everything had a purpose. They were sharper and also had more energy than we did."" TIP INS Suns: Once again started three rookies in Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton and De'Anthony Melton. .. After an early dunk by Biyombo over Ayton, Booker yelled ""Get big!"" at his teammate. Hornets: Honored former Hornets small forward Glen Rice at halftime as part of their 30-year anniversary celebration. Rice is the team's career leader in 3-point percentage and is the only Hornets player to play in three All-Star games. An emotional Rice said ""Wow! Wow! Wow!"" while he stood at midcourt after being given a key to the city, and told fans, ""I hope I made you proud."" BIG EFFORT FROM BIGS Bismack Biyombo had 11 points and 13 rebounds, and Willy Hernangomez added nine points and 13 rebounds to help the Hornets outrebound the Suns 53-26 despite playing without injured starting center Cody Zeller. Borrego praised Biyombo's effort as ""fantastic."" Kokoskov said the Suns got caught in too many switches on defense. ""When we switch, that's your guy and you have to compete every possession with your guy, so a lot of times it was a mismatch,"" Kokoskov said. ""It comes down to the collective responsibility on the boards, so you have to stay with your guy and compete with him."" CONSISTENCY NEEDED Forward Kelly Oubre Jr. said the Suns need more consistency, something that will come with more playing experience. Starting three rookies adds to that inconsistency. ""A lot of times it's up and down because we're still learning and growing, so I feel as if once we lock in on the little details of being great, everything else will follow suit,"" Oubre said. BRIDGES DUNK CONTEST? Hornets teammates say they want to see rookie Miles Bridges in the dunk contest at next month's NBA All-Star weekend here in Charlotte, North Carolina. While he's still improving as a player and has a lot to learn, the athletic Bridges has put together quite a highlight reel of high-flying dunks. ""Of course, he should definitely be in there,"" Lamb said. Bridges said he is looking forward to having a chance to compete, but said he hasn't heard anything definitive from the league. TAKING CHARGE(S) Walker isn't just a scorer for the Hornets. The 6-foot-1, 184-pound Walker has shown he'll do anything to win, including taking 15 charges this season -- tied for fifth-most in the NBA. He drew another in the third quarter against the Suns.","401071355"
"DETROIT --  Buddy Hield beat the buzzer with a winning shot for the first time in his NBA career. Hield made an off-balance, fadeaway 3-pointer just before time expired and scored 35 points in the Sacramento Kings' 103-101 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. ""I'm blessed to say I got one in the NBA at the highest level,"" he said. ""It's a fun. As a kid, you always dream of hitting one of those type of shots. It's something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Detroit outscored the Kings in each of the first three quarters and had a 12-point cushion midway through the fourth. That wasn't enough. Hield made a 3-pointer with 1:11 left to put Sacramento ahead for the first time since midway through the first quarter. Blake Griffin, who scored 38 points, scored on the ensuing possession to put the Pistons ahead 101-100. Griffin had a chance to add to the lead on Detroit's next possession, but he passed to Reggie Jackson, who missed a shot to give the Kings another chance. Hield made the most of it. He fumbled an inbounds pass, scrambled to regain possession and put up a shot from the left wing that hit nothing but the bottom of the net. ""We were trapping him because we knew he couldn't make another play with 3.4 seconds,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""We had three guys there. You have to be shoulder to shoulder, but he got between two guys, saw some daylight and threw one up there."" Hield sprinted around the court after making the game-winner, leaped over a camera cord and led a joyous parade to the locker room. ""The lady almost tripped me. I think she was trying to trip me,"" Hield said. ""She put it up high. Thank God for my track background, I was able to hurdle over the wire."" Griffin scored 14 points in the first quarter to help the Pistons establish control they had until Hield led a charge over the last several minutes of the game. De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley scored 14 point apiece and Willie Cauley-Stein added 12 points for the Kings. Luke Kennard scored 19 points for the Pistons. They were without center Andre Drummond due to him being in concussion protocol. Detroit held Hield scoreless in the third after he had 20 points in the first half, helping the Pistons go into the fourth quarter ahead 82-74. ""We were kind of running in mud,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We hung in there long enough with our defense to make it close at the end and then Buddy got going."" SOONER SHOWDOWN Oklahoma's basketball program was well represented in the game with Hield and Griffin. ""Blake is special,"" Hield said. ""He's one of the guys I look up to."" Hield said Griffin shared some encouraging words after a workout last summer. ""He said, `You're going to be something special,"" Hield recalled. ""He said, `You're better than you're showing."" STAND AND WATCH Detroit's offense often consisted of Griffin dribbling the ball, trying to drive to the basket or backing down his defender while his teammates stood around. ""He's our go-to guy every night,"" Kennard said. ""He knows we needed that from him. And, he wants that role. But we have to help him out. We've got some of the best shooters in the league on this team. If we start making shots, it is going to change everything about spacing."" TIP-INS Kings: With one of the NBA's fastest teams, Sacramento often pushes the ball and scores after opponents make baskets and free throws. ""We just kept trying to runt them,"" Joerger said. ""Maybe they got tired in the fourth."" Pistons: G Ish Smith missed the game along with Drummond with a groin injury. Smith aggravated the injury Friday night in his third game back after missing 19 games.","401071356"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMIllan threw everything he could at rookie Luka Doncic. McMillan asked defensive whiz Victor Oladipo to challenge Doncic's shots, outmuscle him on the perimeter and stay in front when Doncic drove. When the calls didn't go his way and the shots didn't fall, Doncic got frustrated and then ejected. He finished with his lowest point total in more than a month, and the Pacers pulled away from the Dallas Mavericks for a 111-99 victory on Saturday night. ""We made him uncomfortable,"" Pacers center Myles Turner said. ""It was a team effort. We were just trying to get more physical with him."" It worked out quite well. While Tyreke Evans scored 19 points and Domantas Sabonis added 16 points and 11 rebounds, Indiana won for the third time in four games because it stymied one of the league's bright young stars with a stellar defensive effort. Doncic finished with eight points on 3-of-14 shooting. He was 0 for 5 on 3-pointers and 2 of 4 on free throws. And after Doncic drew his second technical foul, with 3 minutes left in the third quarter for kicking the ball, the Mavericks (20-25) never had a chance. ""I wasn't playing well. For sure, it was one of the worst games I've played this season, so yes I was frustrated,"" the 6-foot-7 Doncic said, joking that he briefly was playing soccer. ""I didn't know I would be ejected because there are different rules in Europe."" Oladipo had 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists in addition to his defensive effort. Dallas closed to 92-83 on Devin Harris' layup with 8:28 to play, but Indiana answered with a 13-5 spurt to seal the victory. Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 20 points. DeAndre Jordan had 15 points and 16 rebounds in the Mavs' third straight loss. ""We got up and pressured the ball and tried to disrupt their rhythm,"" McMillan said. ""I thought Vic did a nice job on the ball."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Wesley Matthews had 17 points. ... Doncic was trying to become the first rookie to score 25 points in six straight games since Tim Duncan in February 1998 and the first rookie to record 25 points, five rebounds and five assists in five consecutive games since Michael Jordan did it twice in 1984-85. ... Jordan has 27 double-doubles this season. Pacers: McMillan moved within one victory of tying Jim O'Brien (121) for No. 9 on the Pacers' NBA victory list. McMillan needs two wins to become the 26th coach in league history with 600 wins. ... Indiana hasn't lost back-to-back games since Dec. 18-19. ... Darren Collison scored 16 points. BASKETBALL DAY IN INDIANA Saturday's game capped the third annual daylong celebration of basketball around the state. The 14-hour marathon featured two high school games played at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, three additional high school games that were televised, the Indiana-Purdue game in West Lafayette and the St. John's-Butler game just a few miles away from the Pacers' home court. It was also Hickory night, a promotion that began by honoring the movie ""Hoosiers."" In addition, Indiana State held a reunion to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its national runner-up team, which featured Hall of Famer Larry Bird. ROOTING FOR DIRK If this was Dirk Nowitzki's final game in Indy, Pacers fans gave him a send-off he'll remember. When he entered in the first half, the crowd roared. In the fourth quarter, with the crowd chanting ""We want Dirk,"" he re-entered with 2:59 to play. Nowitzki also had a tough night, going scoreless for the third time this season. He finished 0 for 5 from the field, all on 3s, and had one rebound and one block in a little less than 10 minutes. ""It was fun being out there, seeing how much respect he has around the league,"" said Turner, who grew up in Dallas. ""The last minute of the game, yeah, I wanted him to get a basket.""","401071357"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Eric Bledsoe made it easy for the Milwaukee Bucks and superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo. Bledsoe scored 30 points, Antetokounmpo had 25 points and 13 rebounds and the Bucks won their fourth straight game, beating the Orlando Magic 118-108 on Saturday night. ""It's great to have a lot of options and be able to go in different directions,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Eric was just great. He made some 3s, got to the basket, did a lot defensively. He just did a little bit of everything."" Malcolm Brogdon added 18 points, and Khris Middleton had 15. The Bucks are 11-2 in their last 13 games. ""Eric can go 12 of 14, score 30 points and still get everyone involved,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""He's a pass- first point guard. We play faster and more together with him. He makes the game a lot easier for me, Malcolm, Khris (Middleton) and Brook (Lopez)."" Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 27 points, Terrence Ross had 16, D.J. Augustin 14 and Jarell Martin 12.  The Magic struggled with Aaron Gordon sitting out with a back injury, dropping their third straight. ""We can't play defense like we've played these last four games,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Against (Milwaukee's) defense, the best defense in the NBA, we got 108 at home. You've got to give yourself a chance to win, but our defense is just not where it needs to be."" Vucevic and Ross helped the Magic trim a 16-point third-quarter deficit to five going into the final period. Vucevic had a 3-pointer and three-point play in an 11-2 run, and Ross scored the Magic's last nine points of the quarter to make it 87-82. Martin's 3-pointer on Orlando's first possession of the fourth quarter made it 87-85, but that was as close as they would get. Bledsoe scored nine points to help the Bucks pull away. His three-point play with 9:09 left gave Milwaukee a 99-89 advantage. Orlando cut it to 106-102 with four minutes to play, but the Bucks scored on seven of their next eight possessions. TIP-INS Bucks: The Bucks had 31 fast-break points to just two for Orlando. ... C Brook Lopez had four blocks in the first six minutes. ... The Bucks arrived in Orlando early Thursday and had three days of rest waiting for the game. Magic: Martin made three straight 3-pointers in his first appearance in six games. He finished with four 3-pointers, matching his total for the entire season.","401071358"
"ATLANTA --  Kyrie Irving and the Boston Celtics found a way. Not bad for the second part of back-to-back games. Irving scored 32 points and the Celtics rallied to beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-105 on Saturday for their third straight win. After trailing for most of the night, Boston took the lead with a 9-0 fourth-quarter run, including a go-ahead 3-pointer by Jaylen Brown, who had 14 points. The Celtics had been only 2-5 in the second game of back-to-backs. That made the comeback especially satisfying for coach Brad Stevens. ""We just were gritty ... We need that kind of response to what we've done the last few opportunities we had back-to-backs,"" Stevens said. A drive by Irving gave Boston the lead for good at 101-100. Al Horford made four free throws and a layup to help the Celtics increase their advantage to 109-100 with 1:11 left. Kevin Huerter led Atlanta with 18 points, and fellow rookie Trae Young had 16. Minutes after he was called for his first technical following his fourth foul about three minutes into the third quarter, Boston's Marcus Smart was ejected following an altercation with Atlanta's DeAndre Bembry. With Atlanta leading 76-69, Smart and Bembry had to be separated after they exchanged words as players lined up for a jump ball. After being restrained by teammates and coaches, Smart broke free and charged toward Bembry before being restrained again. Smart did not talk with reporters after the game. ""He lost his cool after the ref told him he's ejected,"" Bembry said. ""I think after that he just thought he had nothing else to lose."" Bembry said it wasn't unusual to see Smart lose control. Irving described Smart as fiery. ""We accept Marcus for who he is ... It's our responsibility to pick him up,"" Irving said. Bembry also was called for a technical foul following a video review of the incident. Boston's Jayson Tatum opened the game with a three-point play. The Hawks scored the next 10 points and kept the lead until Brown's 3-pointer with 9:07 remaining gave Boston a 95-93 edge. TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum had 19 points and Horford had 13. ... Due to expected bad weather in the Boston area on Saturday night, there were tentative plans for a return flight on Sunday. Travel concerns also led to F Gordon Hayward remaining in Boston, where his wife is expecting the couple's third child.  ""With pending weather, there was no reason to make this trip,"" Stevens said of Hayward. Hawks: John Collins and Alex Len each had 15 points. ... Collins (bronchitis-like symptoms) and Young (flu-like symptoms) started after being upgraded before the game. ... C Dewayne Dedmon (left ankle sprain) had six points in 24 minutes in his return after missing two games. KYRIE IN CONTROL One night after scoring 38 points against Memphis, Irving went 5 for 8 from 3-point range. He pulled the Celtics back from a 50-34 deficit by scoring 15 of Boston's final 19 points of the first half, cutting the Atlanta lead to 67-60. ""The first-half defense just wasn't very good,"" Stevens said. ""Kyrie was special and he kept us in it."" COLD FINISH After leading 89-83 through three quarters, the Hawks were outscored 30-16 in the final 12 minutes while making only 6 of 20 shots from the field, including 1 of 11 3-pointers. HOT HUERTER Huerter continued to shine in his fill-in starting role while Kent Bazemore recovers from a sprained right ankle. Huerter has made 45.5 percent of his 3-point attempts to lead all NBA qualifying rookies. He made 4 of 10 3s against Boston.","401071359"
"TORONTO --  Danny Green knocked down 3 after 3, and as he did, he heard something unusual: Toronto fans chanting his name. Green had a season-high 24 points and set a franchise record for 3-pointers in a quarter with seven in the third, and the Raptors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 119-90 on Saturday night. ""I haven't heard that since I was a little kid, from your parents on the sidelines,"" Green said of the ""Danny, Danny"" chants. ""It was fun."" When Green was young, his dad used to be the one calling his name at games, although not to offer congratulations. ""It wasn't a positive cheer,"" Green said. ""It was more of a criticizing, coaching what you need to do better kind of cheer. You could hear him anywhere."" Serge Ibaka scored 18 points, Pascal Siakam had 17 and the Raptors extended their home winning streak to nine. Toronto is 20-4 at home. ""That was awesome,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""We hadn't had one like that in a while. It was good to see some of our shooters make some shots."" Green shot 7 for 9 from 3-point range in the third quarter and Toronto made 10 from long range in the period, outscoring Memphis 45-14 to take a 100-62 lead into the fourth. ""It was a lot of open ones,"" Green said. ""It wasn't like they were tough, contested or difficult shots. Just run the floor, get to the corner and get to the space."" Green had 21 points in the third, one shy of Kyle Lowry's franchise record for a quarter. He matched a career high with eight 3s for the game. Green also made eight 3-pointers against Minnesota in 2013. ""We were getting in the paint and their system is to collapse, and we kept finding him,"" Nurse said. The 45-point third was Toronto's highest-scoring quarter of the season, and the highest-scoring third quarter in franchise history. Norman Powell scored 14 points, C.J. Miles matched his season high with 13 and Lowry had 12 as the Raptors won for the seventh time in eight games. Toronto finished 17 for 36 from 3-point range. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 16 points, Shelvin Mack had 14, and Ivan Rabb had 13 points and 10 rebounds as the short-handed Grizzlies lost for the 11th time in 12 games. Memphis has lost seven straight on the road. ""Until we find that consistency from the offensive end, things will be challenging and we'll have to keep fighting,"" said guard Mike Conley, who scored 10 points. Raptors forward Kawhi Leonard missed his second straight game for rest. Leonard also sat out Thursday's win over Phoenix, the second game of a back-to-back. The Grizzlies were without centres Marc Gasol (sore back) and Joakim Noah (personal reasons). Ibaka scored 10 points in the first, and the Raptors closed the quarter with a 7-2 spurt to lead 23-19 after one. Toronto led 55-48 at halftime. The Raptors opened the third with a 10-0 run as Memphis didn't score for 3:13. ""They came out with purpose in that third quarter and kind of knocked us out,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We've got to do a better job of understanding who the hot guy is."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis missed six straight shots to start the game before a 3-pointer by Temple. ...

"CHICAGO --  Dwyane Wade had a simple mission for his final game in his hometown. Win. Wade had 14 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, helping the Miami Heat beat the skidding Chicago Bulls 117-103 on Saturday night. ""I wasn't coming off that floor until we got that win,"" he said. ""That's how I wanted to end my last game here. I didn't want to go out and score 30 or anything like that. It doesn't matter as much as getting a win."" Wade, who turned 37 on Thursday, plans to retire at the end of his 16th NBA season. He got a warm reception in his return, hearing several loud ovations throughout the night. ""It was just joyous just to see and hear so much great appreciation for what I've been able to do in the game of basketball,"" he said. Josh Richardson had 26 points for Miami, and Dion Waiters finished with 21. The Heat had dropped two in a row. Chicago lost its 10th straight game. Zach LaVine scored 22 points for the Bulls, and Bobby Portis had 21. Lauri Markkanen finished with 20 points and nine rebounds. ""I thought we were in control of the game until maybe the last three minutes of the second quarter,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""I don't think we managed the end of the quarters very well."" Wade played for the Bulls during the 2016-17 season, and the team honored him with a video tribute during the first timeout in the first quarter. The sellout crowd gave Wade a standing ovation and he responded by waving to the fans. Wade got another loud ovation when he entered the game. He shot an air ball on his first attempt, but then nailed a 3-pointer on his second shot. He had nine first-half points, but the Heat trailed 57-55 at the break. Richardson had 11 points on 4-for-6 shooting and Wade added five in the third quarter as Miami took an 83-76 lead into the fourth. With Miami leading 91-86 early in the final quarter, the Heat went on a 14-2 run to put the game away. ""In the second half, they came with that spirit, more aggressiveness,"" Chicago's Kris Dunn said. ""They punched us in the mouth and we didn't respond."" All that remained was one last send-off for Wade. He heard more loud cheers when he exited with two minutes to play. ""That was cool,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""You hope in these situations it can all work out perfect where your team can play well, where the game can be in control for the coach's sake and you can give him a chance for the ovation he deserves."" TIP-INS Heat: Wade entered with 997 career points against Chicago. He now has scored 1,000 points against eight NBA teams. Bulls: Rookie C Wendell Carter Jr. is going to have surgery on his left thumb, but no date has been set for the procedure. He is expected to be sidelined for eight to 12 weeks. ""He's meeting with his family and his representation and our medical staff,"" Boylen said. CHICAGO G.O.A.T. Wade was asked if he was the greatest Chicago-area basketball player of all-time. ""I have no idea,"" he said. ""When people have asked me who I think the best player who was born and raised in Chicago, I always go with Isiah Thomas."" Thomas averaged 19.2 points and 9.3 assists in 13 NBA seasons. He also won two NBA championships with the Detroit Pistons. Thomas tweeted during the game he thought Wade was the best player to come out of Chicago. ""I will be second to him any day!"" Thomas posted.

"HOUSTON --  James Harden was the star for the Houston Rockets as usual on Saturday night, but he and the team got a big boost from Eric Gordon in his second game back after recovering from a bruised knee. Harden scored 48 points, Gordon added 30 and the Rockets overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 138-134 in overtime. The Rockets trailed for most of the night and were down by 18 in the second-half. Gordon sent it to overtime with a 3-pointer, and made four free throws in the last seconds of the extra period. ""He's playing unbelievable,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said of Gordon. Coming off 57- and 58-point games, Harden had his 19th straight game with at least 30 and he's had 40 in 10 of the last 13. He was 14 of 30 from the field, going 8 of 19 on 3-pointers, and hit 12 of 15 free throws. Harden was asked if Gordon being back after missing eight games before his return on Wednesday night eased the burden on him a little bit. ""A little bit? It takes a lot of burden off me,"" Harden said. ""He's so offensively gifted and talented being able to shoot the basketball, being able to get to the rim, being able to make plays for others. You get a guy like that on the floor with you it makes it easier for not only myself but for everybody."" Brandon Ingram missed a 3 for Los Angeles before Harden hit 1 of 2 free throws to make it 132-130 with less than a minute left. Ingram tied it with a basket, and Harden again made 1 of 2 free throws to make it 133-132. Los Angeles missed a 3 before Gordon also made just 1 of 2 free throws to leave Houston up by two with 12.6 seconds left. Kyle Kuzma lost the ball and it went out of bounds to give Houston the ball back. Gordon added four free throws after that to secure the victory. It was the second straight overtime game for both teams after Houston lost to Brooklyn on Wednesday night and Los Angeles beat Oklahoma City on Thursday night. Kuzma had 32 points for Los Angeles and Ingram added 21 in a game where coach Luke Walton was ejected in the third quarter. Already without LeBron James and Rajon Rondo, the Lakers have another injury concern after Lonzo Ball sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. Walton said his X-rays were negative but that he'd have an MRI and ""we'll see where we are after that."" Four straight points by the Lakers stretched the lead to nine in the fourth quarter, but Harden and Gordon made consecutive 3-pointers cut it to 112-109 with about two minutes remaining. Los Angeles made four free throws to make it 116-109 about a minute later, but Harden made two 3-pointers around a basket by Ivica Zubac to get Houston within three with about 30 seconds left. Lance Stephenson missed a 3-pointer and Harden made two free throws to cut the lead to 118-117 with 5.7 seconds left. Zubac made two more free throws before Gordon's off-balance 3-pointer with 2 seconds left sent it to OT. ""I saw Kentavious Caldwell-Pope running out to me and I thought he was going to fly right by me, but he stood right there,"" Gordon said. ""So I had to try to shoot it with confidence and I'm glad it went in."" The Lakers built a huge lead early and were up 64-46 at halftime, with Kuzma scoring 24 points. They were ahead by 17 with about eight minutes left in the third quarter after scoring five straight points capped by a basket from Kuzma before Houston scored the next 15 points to cut it to 74-72 three minutes later. James Ennis had five points in that stretch and P.J. Tucker capped it with a 3-pointer. Ball was injured just before Houston's run began. He remained on the court for a couple of minutes talking with trainer's before he was helped to his feet where he hopped on his right foot for a few steps before being carried off the court and to the locker room by Stephenson and Michael Beasley. Walton was ejected a couple of minutes after that when he got two technical fouls after yelling at officials during a timeout. Ingram pointed to losing Ball as when things started to get away from the Lakers. ""Right when Lonzo went out,"" he said. ""That's exactly when it went away. We lost momentum a little bit."" TIP-INS Lakers: James was out for the 13th straight game with a strained left groin and did not make the trip. ... Stephenson finished with 16 points. Rockets: Harden also had eight rebounds, six assists and four steals. ... Ennis returned after missing Wednesday's game after cutting his left leg in a fall at his house. ...

Jokic had 19 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in his sixth triple-double this season, and the Nuggets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 124-102 on Saturday night. Jamal Murray scored 26 points as Denver won for the third time in four games, though the lone blemish in that span was a 31-point loss to Golden State earlier this week. ""We were focused,"" Jokic said. ""We played the right way from the get-go."" Trey Lyles had 16 points and Monte Morris finished with 15 for the Nuggets, who went 15 for 37 from 3-point range.

""We played hard, we came out strong and we played for four quarters, which is great. We just have to keep going."" Added Gary Harris: ""Besides a few slipups here and there, we've been taking care of the teams we need to take care of."" Cleveland closed out a six-game trip with its third consecutive loss. It has dropped 15 of 16 overall. ""We couldn't match their size,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""They are a big, physical team. We tried to move some things around.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Darren Collison threw the early scoring punches. Victor Oladipo delivered the decisive second-half flurry. Together, the Indiana Pacers' starting guards were a knockout combination. Oladipo scored 16 of his 21 points in the second half, Collison finished with 19 points and nine assists and surging Indiana pulled away from the Charlotte Hornets 120-95 on Sunday for their fourth win in five games. ""Me, Bojan (Bogdanovic), Vic, we were all being aggressive on the pick-and-roll,"" Collison said. ""When all three of us are aggressive, it's tough to beat us."" The Pacers have proven it by going 11-3 over the past month and improving to 16 games above .500 for the first time since the end of 2013-14. It's not by happenstance, either. Coach Nate McMillan has repeatedly challenged his players to move the ball and stay aggressive on offense while confounding opponents with their ability to stay in front of the ball on defense. Indiana has used that blueprint to win its last four games by 86 points, all by at least 12. Charlotte fell into the same trap as the other teams -- falling behind early and trying to play catch-up against the league's top scoring defense. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 23 points but didn't get enough from a supporting cast that was held in check. Malik Monk finished with 11 points off the bench while Bismack Biyombo and Jeremy Lamb each scored 10 as the Hornets' three-game winning streak ended. ""What's kept us in games in the last few games is our defense. Tonight, it didn't,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""They played well. They shot well."" It didn't take long for the Pacers to start pulling away as Collison scored 11 in the first quarter to help the Pacers jump to a 32-16 lead. Charlotte fought back with a 12-2 spurt to get within 34-28. Then Indiana reasserted itself by rebuilding a 45-32 lead, extending the margin to 17 and fending off the Hornets' second-half charges thanks largely to Oladipo. When Miles Bridges made his second straight 3 late in the third to get Charlotte within 77-71, Oladipo answered with a 16-foot pull-up jumper to start a 7-0 run. Indiana sealed it when Tyreke Evans scored five points in another 7-0 run, which made it 99-81 with 6:46 left. ""We just tried to prepare ourselves defensively, making sure it was tougher for them than it was in the last game,"" Oladipo said, referring to a 26-point loss in Charlotte in November. ""Collectively, we did awesome."" TIP-INS Hornets: Walker has topped the 20-point mark 33 times this season but was assessed a technical foul with 1:08 left in the first quarter. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS -- Derrick Rose and the Minnesota Timberwolves needed this one. With 30 seconds left, Rose missed the first of two free throws and was kicking himself for failing to give his team the lead. ""I kept saying, 'You're going to get another shot,'"" Taj Gibson said he told his longtime teammate. Twenty-nine seconds later, Rose proved Gibson prophetic. Rose hit an 18-footer with 0.9 seconds left to give the Wolves a 116-114 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. He carried his team by scoring 29 of his 31 points in the second half to help Minnesota overcome an 11-point deficit. Gibson dunked to pull Minnesota within one with less than a minute to play. Karl-Anthony Towns intercepted a bad pass from Booker, and Rose hit the second of two foul shots to tie it at 114 with 30.5 seconds remaining. After giving Rose his pep talk, Gibson grabbed the loose ball after Devin Booker lost it on Phoenix's next possession. With the shot clock off and the crowd on its feet, Rose calmly dribbled down the clock against Mikal Bridges before pulling up and hitting the final shot. ""I missed a lot. It was all up to my teammates and the coaches for giving me that confidence, putting the ball in my hands and just believing in me,"" Rose said. It was a good confidence boost for both the oft-injured guard and a team that had lost two of its last three home games by a combined seven points. ""He needed that shot, you know what I'm saying?"" Gibson said. ""He's been putting in so much work in, we've been in that situation a couple times this year and it didn't go his way."" Rose picked up the slack for Towns, who had 30 points but only two after halftime. He went 13-of-13 from the free throw line in the half, but struggled against Phoenix's double-teams in the second. ""We just stepped it up in the second half,"" said Dragan Bender, the main man charged with defending Towns. ""We came out, tried to double him, try to get the ball out of his hands and make the other players make plays."" With Towns struggling against double-teams in the second half, Rose kept the Wolves in the game on 11-for-18 shooting in the half. SLUMPING SUNS T.J. Warren led Phoenix with 21 points, and Booker and Kelly Oubre Jr. each added 18. Warren's last-second corner 3 hit off the side of the backboard. ""I think we played well enough to deserve to win this game, but again, we didn't find a way to close the game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""It's just a bad taste in our mouth after this loss, but we have to learn from mistakes."" The Suns lost all four on their trip to fall to 4-20 on the road this season. A night after losing by 20 in Charlotte, Phoenix shot 46 percent, but went 22-of-32 from the line. ""We had a lot of mistakes that hurt us,"" Warren said. ""We've got to be smarter and value the ball more and just convert."" COACH CONNECTIONS Kokoskov recounted his first memories of Wolves coach Ryan Saunders when serving on Flip Saunders' coaching staff in Detroit through 2008. ""Good things happen to good people, and very well-deserved,"" Kokoskov said. ""Sometimes it's hard when you're coming from a basketball background and a coach's background. It puts a lot of pressure on guys like Ryan because he was in the shadow of Flip. ... I'm really, really happy for Ryan. I think he's going to be a very good coach for a long time in this league TIP-INS Suns: With C Deandre Ayton (ankle) and F Richaun Holmes (foot) out injured, Bender made his first start of the season and had 12 points and 10 rebounds. ""Drag was phenomenal,"" Warren said. ""I'm happy for him."" ... Veteran guard Jamal Crawford, who played last season in Minnesota, was active and on the bench for his 1,300th career game. He missed the previous three games with a sore left knee. ""His experience, his voice, his presence, the wisdom he's sharing in the locker room when the coaches are not around, it's priceless for the group, and we're thrilled to have him,"" Kokoskov said before the game. Timberwolves: Towns notched his 10th career game with 10 or more made free throws. He also matched his career high with four steals. ... F Robert Covington (bruised knee) and G Tyus Jones (ankle) remained out.","401071365"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Los Angeles Clippers have lost so often recently, they had nothing to lose against the San Antonio Spurs. Turns out, that can be a real winning attitude. Tobias Harris had 27 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, and the Clippers beat the Spurs 103-95 on Sunday night to snap a five-game losing streak. ""You see what you do when your back is against the wall,"" Los Angeles veteran Patrick Beverly said. ""We came out swinging."" The Clippers led for all but 14 seconds in handing the Spurs their second straight loss at home. ""I think they out executed us and out competed us tonight every way, shape and form,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""And, we were sloppy with the ball on top of it, so that's a bad combination."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and 14 rebounds for the Spurs, who committed 18 turnovers. San Antonio pulled within 101-95 with 31.7 seconds remaining on Aldridge's final basket, but Los Angeles escaped a full-court press and sealed it on two free throws by Beverly. Beverly finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and five assists. Montrezl Harrell added 18 points in his first start, and Avery Bradley had 15 points for the Clippers. ""Everybody who played, bro, they came in with great energy, good minutes,"" Beverly said. The Clippers had little trouble scoring despite being without Lou Williams and Danilo Gallinari, who both sat out due to injuries. The Clippers went on a 22-2 run bridging the first and second quarters, turning a one-point deficit into a 45-26 lead with 11 minutes remaining in the first half. ""We were physical from the beginning,"" Harris said. ""We had a collective effort, some great plays, extra plays we made from the beginning of the game that just kind of trickled over towards the end of the game."" Rudy Gay had 19 points and Marco Belinelli added 12 points for San Antonio. DeMar DeRozan continued a recent shooting slump by going 4 for 16. He scored eight points in 29 minutes. TIP-INS Clippers: Williams missed his second straight game due to a sore right hamstring. Although coach Doc Rivers said Williams ""looked good"" during morning workouts, the Clippers opted to keep him out. ... Rivers said Gallinari remained in Los Angeles to treat the back spasms that limited him to eight minutes against Golden State on Friday. Spurs: Aldridge has 317 blocks with the Spurs, passing Greg ""Cadillac"" Anderson for 10th in franchise history. ... Belinelli was 2 for 7 on 3-pointers, giving him 300 career 3s with the Spurs. He is the 13th player in franchise history with 300 3-pointers and joins Matt Bonner, Bruce Bowen and Brent Barry as the only ones to do so while shooting over 40 percent. ... Davis Bertans has 250 career 3-pointers. He joins Gary Neal as the only Spurs to reach that mark in their first three seasons with the team. STILL SHOOTING DeRozan's eight points were his second-lowest with the Spurs and marked the sixth straight game he has failed to score 20 points. Although he sat out San Antonio's previous game due to a sore ankle, DeRozan said he is fine physically and simply playing poorly. The 10-year veteran is not worried about his slump, and neither are his teammates. ""The next game's going to come and he's going to do what he does,"" Spurs point guard Derrick White said. ""It happens, it's a long season. I'm not too worried about it.""","401071366"
"NEW YORK --  Paul George, Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder put this game away in a hurry. The Thunder never trailed, bolting to a big lead and romping past the New York Knicks 127-109 on Monday. George scored 31 points and Westbrook just missed a triple-double with 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. George and Westbrook both sat out the fourth quarter. ""We went out with a 20-point lead and our second unit came in and did the same thing,"" George said. ""At that point, game is over."" The Knicks have lost six in a row and 14 of 15, including nine straight at Madison Square Garden. Dennis Schroder added 17 points for the Thunder while both Jerami Grant and Abdel Nader each had 16. Tim Hardaway Jr. led the Knicks with 23 points. Allonzo Trier had 16 and Emmanuel Mudiay scored 14. George opened the scoring with a three-point play and the Thunder never trailed in the game. They led 34-12 late in the first quarter. ""It's the one-quarter woes,"" Hardaway said. ""We have to come out more aggressive. You just have to keep looking ahead. You can't take any of these seconds, minutes or hours back."" New York got within 15 before Westbrook's three-point play gave Oklahoma City a 61-37 lead with 2:21 left in the second quarter. Oklahoma City shot 61.9 percent (13 of 21) on 3-pointers in the first half and 51.7 percent (15 of 29) overall. ""We did a good job,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""One of the things that helped is we shot really well from beyond the 3-point line in the first half, and really the whole game."" The Knicks got no closer than 14 the rest of the way. Steve Adams added 10 points and seven rebounds for the Thunder, who have won two straight after losing five of their previous six games. Enes Kanter had 11 points and Noah Vonleh 10 for the Knicks. TIP-INS Thunder: Since moving from Seattle to Oklahoma City prior to the 2008-09 season, the Thunder have posted a 15-6 record against the Knicks, including wins in six of the last seven meetings. Knicks: Vonleh is the only Knick to play in all 45 games this season. He has started 38 times, second most on the team behind Hardaway (41) . Kanter returned to action after missing three games. KING FOR A DAY The Knicks have usually excelled on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. New York has gone 21-12 overall since the national holiday was first observed in 1986. The Knicks lost to the 76ers on January 20, 1986, but won their next their next nine games on the holiday. ""It's a blessing to be able to play on Martin Luther King Day,"" Westbrook said. ""The things he's done for guys like myself and guys in this locker room to be able to go out and play, to walk around freely and do things in the world is exceptional."" OFFENSIVE THUNDER Oklahoma City has four players averaging at least 15 points per game (George, Westbrook, Adams, Schroder). Only five other NBA teams (Bucks, Clippers, Pelicans, Rockets, 76ers) have as many. In contrast, the Knicks only have one (Hardaway). OUT AT HOME The Knicks haven't won at home since a 136-134 overtime victory against the Bucks on Dec. 1. New York is now 4-14 at MSG.","401071367"
"CLEVELAND --  Somebody was bound to break a long skid Monday -- Zach LaVine and the Chicago Bulls seized the opportunity. LaVine scored 25 points and the Bulls broke a 10-game losing streak, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 104-88 in a meeting of teams that began the day with the worst records in the NBA. ""It stinks to lose 10 in row,"" said guard Kris Dunn, who scored 13 points and was one of five Bulls to hit double figures. ""A game like this can galvanize us."" Chicago (11-36) never trailed and has won all three games this season against Cleveland (9-39), which has lost 16 of 17 overall. ""We talked about the first quarter starts,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""Our energy and spirit were good, kind of gave us momentum into the rest of the game."" The Bulls hit 15 of 29 3-pointers and built a 21-point lead in the fourth quarter. Chicago won for the first time since Dec. 28 against Washington. Bobby Portis had 15 points while Lauri Markkanen added 13 for the Bulls, who have rolled to two lopsided wins at Cleveland in less than a month. The Bulls defeated the Cavaliers 99-98 in Chicago on Nov. 10 and routed Cleveland 112-92 on Dec. 23 at Quicken Loans Arena. Rookie Collin Sexton scored 18 points, but had no assists in 29 minutes for the Cavaliers. Ante Zizic, who is seeing playing time because of injuries in Cleveland's frontcourt, had 13 points. Chicago hit 12 of 22 shots in the first quarter and built a 15-point lead late in the period. Cleveland cut into the margin and trailed by six at halftime before the Bulls regained control by making five 3-pointers in the third quarter. ""We got a lot from a lot of guys,"" Boylen said. ""Kris was very good. Zach was real efficient, which we need him to be."" The Cavaliers, in addition to dealing with several injuries, looked like a tired team after going 1-5 on a road trip that ended Saturday night in Denver. Cleveland missed its first eight shots and coach Larry Drew called timeout less than four minutes into the game. ""I'm not going to use that as an excuse or as crutch,"" Drew said. ""Early on, I could see they did not have their legs. We clearly didn't have the zap. I really thought at some point it would kick in, but we did not have it."" TIP-INS Bulls: The team announced after the game that C Wendell Carter Jr. had successful surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb Monday morning. The rookie is expected to be sidelined for eight to 12 weeks. The surgery was performed by Dr. John Fernandez at Midwest Orthopedics at Rush Hospital in Chicago  ... Robin Lopez started at center and Portis saw minutes in the pivot. ... LaVine dunked off an alley-oop pass from Kris Dunn in the second quarter. Cavaliers: C Tristan Thompson missed his third straight game because of a sore left foot. ""As long as he's feeling any kind of discomfort, we're going to keep him out,"" Drew said. Thompson missed 10 games in December with the injury. ... F Larry Nance Jr. is expected to miss two more weeks with a sprained right knee. TOUGH TRIP The Cavaliers' 11-day trip began Jan. 9 and finally ended Saturday. Cleveland broke a 12-game losing streak against the Los Angeles Lakers, playing without the injured LeBron James, on Jan. 13. The Cavaliers returned to Cleveland at 4:30 a.m. Sunday. Their flight landed in the middle of a snowstorm that began early Saturday and lasted about 24 hours. The storm, which dumped about a foot of snow on the area, and made the drive home a challenge. ""A few guys got stuck in snow,"" Drew said. ""We were out in the middle of the intersection pushing cars. I don't believe I closed my eyes until about 6:30."" GOOD BALANCE Chicago had 11 players score and five were in double figures. Jabari Parker hit two 3-pointers early in the fourth and finished with 10. Lopez had eight points and nine rebounds. NO ADVANTAGE The Cavaliers haven't won at home since Dec. 12 against New York. Cleveland has lost eight in a row at Quicken Loans Arena.","401071368"
"WASHINGTON --  Exchanging their freewheeling ways for an improved defensive showing, the Washington Wizards looked like an entirely different team in their first game back from London. The Wizards turned in their best defensive performance of the season on Monday in beating the Detroit Pistons 101-87. Even though Blake Griffin put up a game-high 29 points, Detroit's scoring output was the lowest by a Washington opponent this year. That's a major step forward for the NBA's second-worst defensive team. ""It was just effort,"" said Bradley Beal, who scored 16 points. ""It's just a matter of being locked in, locking in to the game plan. We let Blake get a little comfortable, but for the most part we did a good job of taking all their actions away and making it difficult for them."" After beating the New York Knicks in London last week, the Wizards now have won two in a row and are 7-3 in their past 10 games. Washington held Detroit to 30 percent shooting in the first half and never let their lead dip below 10 points in the second. The Wizards limited the Pistons to two offensive rebounds and had seven players in double figures, led by Trevor Ariza with 20 and Otto Porter Jr. with 19 off the bench. ""I looked at that in the first quarter (thinking) this is a good night for us: We have a lot of assists and everybody's touching the ball and everybody's getting shots,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""We have to be able to continue to play with a lot of pace and a lot of extra passing."" Pistons coach Dwane Casey was hoping players would drink a gallon of coffee to be ready for the 2 p.m. start. Instead, Detroit scored just 17 points in the first quarter and was never able to recover. ""I thought we just came out with low energy,"" Griffin said. ""Games like this you got to find a way, weird time, you just got to find a way to have better energy."" The Pistons have lost two in a row and 10 of their past 14. TIP-INS Pistons: Their 34 first-half points set a new season low. ... C Andre Drummond missed his second consecutive game with a concussion. Casey said Drummond is still in the concussion protocol and didn't travel with the team ... G Ish Smith sat out for the 21st time in 24 games because of a right adductor injury. Wizards: Beat Detroit for the eighth consecutive time at home. ... Tomas Satoransky had a game-high eight assists, including a pass through Zaza Pachula's legs in the first quarter. ... Signed G Gary Payton II to a 10-day contract 15 years after general manager Ernie Grunfeld, then with Milwaukee, traded for Payton's father. ... Played at home on Martin Luther King Jr. Day for the 20th consecutive time and 16th at home over that stretch. SIXTH MAN PORTER The Wizards began bringing Porter off the bench when he returned following a right knee injury to ease him back in. It has since become a habit, not because Porter is still building up but because Brooks likes how his team is playing and doesn't want to mess with success. ""Otto's getting obviously starter minutes or about nearly as many minutes as he had as a starter,"" Brooks said. ""The thing I like about it is he's getting more shots, and we need Otto to take more shots."" CASEY WANTS CHALLENGE Two days after losing to Sacramento on a shot by Buddy Hield that the Pistons thought was a double-dribble, Casey said he'd be on board with a coach's challenge system -- if it can be done quickly without games dragging. ""Very difficult because of the time constraints you have within the game,"" Casey said. ""If you can fit it in within that two-hour (window) or whatever it is constraints that we have with television, I think it can be effective."" SMITH IN STANDS Injured Redskins quarterback Alex Smith took in the game from a suite wearing a substantial cast and brace on his right leg. Smith, who broke his tibia and fibula Nov. 18 against Houston, spent almost a month in the hospital after multiple surgeries, and his playing future is in doubt.","401071369"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks' offense as usual Monday, with a little help from Brook Lopez's blossoming long-range shooting. On the other end of the floor, Lopez helped Milwaukee clamp down in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day matinee. Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 15 rebounds, Lopez had five blocks and 10 rebounds, and the Bucks beat the Dallas Mavericks 116-106. ""We have a lot of firepower offensively,"" Lopez said. ""But we definitely make our money and get our bread on the defensive end. That's what really identifies this team."" Lopez has 11 blocked shots in the past two games. ""His reads and his decision-making defensively are really, really good,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He's just getting better and better as the season goes on. He's getting more aggressive."" Milwaukee has won five straight and 12 of 14 to improve to 34-12 overall. Eric Bledsoe added 21 points, and Malcolm Brogdon had 19. The 7-foot Lopez added four 3-pointers Luka Doncic had 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Dallas, which has lost four in a row. Jalen Brunson had 16 points. Doncic, a rookie, had his first career triple-double despite making just 6 of 17 shots. ""I didn't play good at all,"" Doncic said. ""I missed some shots that I shouldn't miss."" After trailing at the half, the Bucks built a double-digit lead in the third quarter and led 92-84 heading to the fourth. The game turned late in the third quarter when the Mavericks' Dwight Powell was ejected after being whistled for a pair of technical fouls following Sterling Brown's corner 3-pointer. Brogdon made both technical foul shots to give Milwaukee a nine-point lead. Powell thought he was held while going for a rebound, which prompted the outburst, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He talked to me and the team about it and he's very sorry that he got thrown out,"" Carlisle said. ""In a game like this, you need all your guys, especially a mobile big man."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Carlisle called a timeout one minute into the game after Dallas fell behind 4-0. ... DeAndre Jordan started after spraining his left ankle in Saturday night's game against Indiana and only taking part in the walkthrough portion of Sunday's practice. Bucks: Brogdon delivered brief on-court remarks about Martin Luther King prior to tip-off. ... Lopez blocked three shots in the first quarter after rejecting four first-quarter shots against Orlando on Saturday. ... Milwaukee recalled Christian Wood from the Wisconsin Herd of the G League. On Saturday, Wood scored 24 points and pulled down a Herd franchise-record 23 rebounds. HEY BROTHER Antetokounmpo suited up against his younger brother, Kostas, for the first time in the NBA. Kostas is with Dallas on a two-way contract and joined the Mavericks on this road trip after spending most of the season in the G League. Kostas was on the bench but did not play. ""I had mixed feelings when he was doing something good,"" Kostas said about watching his brother. SMITH RETURNING The Mavs will be rejoined by guard Dennis Smith Jr. on Tuesday when they host the Los Angeles Clippers. Smith didn't play Monday, his sixth consecutive game missed and the 16th time he hasn't played in Dallas' last 24 contests. Smith and Carlisle spoke Sunday, and from there it was revealed that Smith, who has been a rumored trade possibility, will resume workouts. NOWITZKI FAREWELL It's possible that Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki, who was drafted by the Bucks in 1998, made his final trip to Milwaukee as a player. Milwaukee traded Nowitzki in a prearranged draft-night deal -- the Bucks talked Dallas into taking Robert Traylor with the No. 6 pick on their behalf, then took Nowitzki for the Mavs three spots later. A 13-time All-Star, Nowitzki has played at Milwaukee 16 times in his career but didn't appear Monday. It's unclear if Nowitzki will play next season. ""He is one of the most incredible players,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's created more nightmares for game plans. He's just a great humble, normal, hard-working guy.""","401071370"
"ATLANTA --  Though only 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, the Orlando Magic are talking about their playoff hopes. One spot back in 12th, the Atlanta Hawks have not shown the consistency needed to join that discussion. Evan Fournier and Nikola Vucevic scored 29 points apiece to lead the Magic to a 122-103 victory over the Hawks on Monday in the season's first matchup between the Southeast Division rivals. Vucevic had 14 rebounds and Fournier had seven assists as Orlando snapped a three-game losing streak. Dewayne Dedmon led Atlanta with 24 points on the holiday celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. and in the city where the civil rights leader was born. The Magic had targeted road games this week against the Hawks and Nets as starting points for a turnaround. ""We said these next couple games can define our season,"" Vucevic said. ""... We understand if we don't wake up it's going to be really, really hard for us."" The win left the Magic only 2 1/2 games behind eighth-place Charlotte in the East. ""We're doing everything we can to get into that eighth spot,"" Fournier said. By contrast, Atlanta is 5 1/2 games behind Orlando in the conference standings. The young Hawks have lessons to learn about consistency. ""In the first quarter I thought we were good,"" said rookie Trae Young, referring to Atlanta's 31-28 early lead. ""After that we were just out of rhythm, up and down from there. I don't know what happened."" Before the unusually late first game between division rivals, Magic coach Steve Clifford and Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce both expressed uncertainties about the matchups. ""I think we'll have to adjust on the fly,"" Pierce said. The Hawks struggled to find an answer for Vucevic. The 7-foot center made only one 3-pointer but found most of his points near the basket. He made 12 of 23 shots from the field. Vucevic also made an impact on defense, blocking an Alex Len shot when Atlanta trailed by eight points, 103-95. D.J. Augustin's 3-pointer pushed Orlando's lead back to double figures, 106-95. The Hawks didn't mount another serious surge. Dedmon forced Vucevic to play defense far from the basket. Dedmon made five of seven 3-pointers. Atlanta led 44-38 before Orlando scored 12 straight points for a 50-44 advantage. The Magic led 60-57 at halftime and stretched the advantage to 91-78 through three quarters. Young had 21 points. John Collins had 14 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Magic: F Aaron Gordon (sore lower back) missed his second straight game. Clifford said Gordon is doing better but added: ""There's no way he could play. ...  When you can look at him and see he's not OK, then he's not OK."" ... Augustin had 15 points while making four of six 3s. Hawks: Rookie F Kevin Huerter (sore neck) was ruled out minutes before tipoff. Taurean Prince had nine points as the fill-in starter, shortly after Pierce said there was no immediate plan to move Prince back into the lineup. Huerter has started 27 games and has been an emerging scorer, especially on 3-pointers. ... Jeremy Lin had 15 points. MLK DAY Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who worked closely with King, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver attended the game as part of the King holiday celebration. Trae Young wrote King's famous words ""I have a dream"" on his shoe. ""Today is a different day because it's something bigger than us,"" he said.

"NEW YORK --  When D'Angelo Russell finished punishing the Kings with his offense in the third quarter, the Nets shut them down with their defense. Add it up, and it made for one lopsided second half. Russell had 31 points and eight assists, and the surging Nets won their fourth straight game by running away from Sacramento in the second half Monday for a 123-94 victory. Brooklyn outscored Sacramento 68-34 after halftime, including 30-9 in the fourth quarter. ""I think we just wore them down, just kept wearing and tearing,"" Nets forward DeMarre Carroll said. ""Our depth -- you could see a lot of guys getting in on the action. A lot of guys stepped up. I think our depth really wore them down. They finally broke in the third and fourth quarters."" Russell, announced as the Eastern Conference player of the week shortly before the game, made seven 3-pointers. He hit all four 3-point attempts and was 5 for 6 overall in the third quarter, fueling a 22-4 spurt that launched the Nets into the lead for good. Still, the Kings were down eight after three and poised to get the first basket of the fourth when Yogi Ferrell came up with a steal. But Russell hustled back and forced him to miss the layup and follow shot, and the Nets then scored five straight points to push it back into double digits. It was never close again. ""We wanted to make it a focal point of our defense to get back and make plays,"" Russell said. Joe Harris added 19 points and rookie Rodions Kurucs had 16 for the Nets, who won for the 17th time in 22 games. Reserve guard Bogdan Bogdanovic had 22 points and 11 assists for the Kings, but starters Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox both had quiet games. Hield, whose 3-pointer in the final second of the game beat Detroit on Saturday, shot 4 for 10 for 11 points. Fox finished 4 for 14 and had nine points and six assists. ""Everybody got brain dead,"" Hield said. ""We didn't execute. One dribble, pass. One dribble, shot. Come down, one dribble, shot. No ball movement, no continuity."" The Nets and Kings are two of the most improved teams in the NBA this season, both chasing playoff spots. The Nets (25-23) won only 28 games last season -- they didn't win their 25th until March 31 -- and entered play sixth in the Eastern Conference. The Kings (24-23) were 27-55 last season and now sit just outside the playoff picture as they seek their first berth since 2006, the longest current drought in the league. They played a back-and-forth game for a half before it was just about all Nets from there. Brooklyn led 29-23 after one, but the Kings opened the second with a 15-4 burst to sprint into the lead and took a 60-55 advantage into the locker room. The Nets came right back with a 38-point third, highlighted by the big run that Russell capped with a 3-pointer to make it 77-66 midway through the period. He made three 3s in the spurt, then another late in the period when the Kings had recovered and cut it back down to five. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento is 1-2 on its six-game trip. ... Justin Jackson scored 14 points.  ... Iman Shumpert was 1 for 10 from the floor. Nets: Russell averaged 28 points and 7.0 assists last week, shooting 53 percent both overall and from 3-point range. He tied his career high with 40 points in leading the Nets' comeback from 21 down to a victory over Orlando on Friday. ... The 34-point differential was the Nets' third-biggest ever in a second half. BETTER IN BROOKLYN The Nets have won a season-best six straight at home. They are 10-1 in their last 11 games at Barclays Center. ""I feel the momentum building with the fans,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I hear it. I hear the rhetoric in the stands."" GETTING THE BEST OF THE WEST Brooklyn has won six straight against West teams after a 2-11 start against the other conference. It's the Nets' longest winning streak against the West within one season since taking eight in a row in 2005-06.","401071372"
"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving moved closer to some elite Boston Celtics company with his latest double-double. It was his three driving baskets, though, that helped seal the victory. Irving had 26 points and 10 assists, Al Horford added 16 points and 12 rebounds and the Celtics beat the Miami Heat 107-99 Monday night for their fourth straight win. Irving has had 20 or more points and 10 or more assists in 10 games. Hall of Famer Larry Bird accomplished the feat 11 times in 1986-87. Boston led by 19 points entering the final quarter, before Miami rallied and closed within 99-94 with 4 1/2 minutes to play. Irving then hit three spinning, driving baskets in the paint on the Celtics' next three possessions to secure the win. ""He just has a great ability to find those seams and finish,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's obviously got unbelievable touch. We were just trying to get simple slips and screens for him and let him do his thing. He's pretty special at that."" Irving downplayed it as: ""That's what I'm supposed to be doing, be aggressive. That's pretty much it."" Jayson Tatum added 19 points and Marcus Morris 17 for the Celtics, who won their ninth straight at home and improved to 18-5 at TD Garden. Derrick Jones Jr. and Dion Waiters led the Heat with 18 points apiece. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra knew stopping Irving would be the key. ""We were able to inch our way back into the game, and pretty much you have to play perfectly offensively when you're dealing with Kyrie Irving on the other end,"" he said. ""It seemed like he made every single play when we were trying to get the ball out of his hands. He was just brilliant there at the end."" The building was somewhat quiet for most of the game, until the Celtics broke it open in the third quarter. Boston shot a torrid 72.7 percent (16 of 22) in the third, outscoring the Heat 37-18. The teams were tied at the half before Boston opened the third with a 9-0 run over a 1:39 stretch. Following a 3-pointer by Miami's Tyler Johnson, the Celtics took charge by scoring 11 of the next 14 points, pushing their lead to 70-56. Tatum and Horford each had a pair of buckets before Morris closed it with a three-point play. The Celtics used a late 12-3 run to move in front 87-68 after three periods. TIP-INS Heat: It was Spoelstra's 849th game, tying him with Pat Reilly for most in franchise history. . G Dwayne Wade, mainly seen as a rival player to Boston fans, got a nice ovation from the crowd when he checked in midway into the opening quarter. ""Did not expect it,"" he said. ""I said it, I think, earlier in the year, I was like: `One city will probably not give me an ovation.' I actually said Boston. So, it was cool."" Celtics: Stevens earned his 250th win with the team. . It was the first of three straight home games, culminating with defending champion Golden State in a nationally-televised matchup Saturday night. . C Robert Williams, the team's top draft pick last spring, was inactive. Stevens said they're considering sending him to the G-League for playing time. SHOWING RESPECT Stevens praised another local professional sports team, discussing the Patriots' victory in the AFC title game Sunday. ""It was amazing. I think being in this and knowing how hard it is to win a single game, I was telling my son you're living the 60's Celtics, the 60's and 70's UCLA,"" he said. ""That's the kind of thing we're talking about with what the Patriots have accomplished."" SPEAKING PRAISE Irving addressed the crowd about the late Martin Luther King Jr. just before tipoff. ""Tonight, we celebrate and honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, a man who truly embodies what it means to be a leader, a visionary and a dreamer,"" he said. ""But I think what we most remember him for is for his stance and his action. He fought for justice, equality and, most importantly, peace for all. So, on behalf of the Celtics organization with everybody here, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King today.""","401071373"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Jusuf Nurkic had heard enough. Rudy Gobert chirped after blocking his shot and Jae Crowder got in his face. But in the third quarter, Nurkic tuned out all that noise and put the Portland Trail Blazers in position to beat the Utah Jazz 109-104 on Monday night. ""They started talking a little bit too much,"" Nurkic said. ""But I'm too busy to have all those conversations."" Damian Lillard scored 26 points and hit key shots down the stretch, but Nurkic's 17-point, four-block third quarter was the talk of the Portland locker room after the game. ""He was huge. They blocked a few of his shots but we just kept giving it to him in the paint and he figured it out. He got his timing down and getting into Rudy's body. He started rolling,"" Lillard said. In a matchup between two of the NBA's hottest teams, the Blazers made 50 percent of their shots and piled up 30 assists to snap Utah's six-game winning streak. Nurkic finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. He also tied a career high with six blocks. CJ McCollum added 14 points for Portland, which has won seven of nine. At halftime, Lillard reminded Nurkic to forget the first half. The big man watched some video clips and came out with a renewed determination. ""I'm growing up here in Portland and I realize that every quarter is new and gives you another chance,"" Nurkic said. Meyers Leonard's second 3-pointer of the fourth quarter capped a 10-2 burst, all without Lillard on the court, to give the Blazers a 96-88 lead. On the other end, the Jazz missed open shot after open shot, helping Portland take command. Donovan Mitchell continued his high-scoring streak with 36 points for Utah. Crowder added 15 and Gobert had 10 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks. Lillard came back in and drained a 3 for a 101-90 advantage. Mitchell desperately tried to will the Jazz back with a variety of drives and shots in the lane, but no one else could score for Utah. ""We can't wait till the fourth quarter to kind of fight and come back. We've got to be locked in from the beginning,"" Mitchell said. McCollum gave Portland its biggest lead at 106-94 with 2:45 remaining. Mitchell's free throws brought the Jazz to 108-104, but after Gobert's block Joe Ingles missed a wide-open corner 3, Utah's seventh straight miss from long distance down the stretch. ""We can't rely, sometimes, on being 3-point happy,"" Mitchell said. Nurkic scored 17 points in the third quarter against Utah's frontline, which has anchored the toughest defense in the league over the past 10 games. His layup, three-point play and tip-in -- a personal 7-0 run -- gave the Blazers an 80-75 edge late in the period. ""We leave the roll open for a spilt second and they found him. We were late on those rotations in the third quarter and it cost us,"" Crowder said. Portland's 30 assists marked the 10th time in the last 12 games the Blazers have recorded at least 25. They are 14-3 this season when they finish with 25 or more. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: The first nine Portland baskets were points in the paint. Conversely, the Blazers went more than eight minutes in the second quarter without an inside basket. ... Evan Turner got a technical for his reaction to a foul by Ricky Rubio in the second quarter. ... Portland shot 7 for 13 in the second half from 3-point range after shooting just 1 of 5 in the first half. Jazz: Crowder got a technical after mixing it up with Nurkic in the third quarter. Gobert was whistled for another technical less than two minutes later. ... Gobert is tied with Joel Embiid for the NBA lead with 39 double-doubles and has posted one in eight consecutive games. ... Mitchell is averaging nearly 30 points over the last nine games. BREAKING DOWN UTAH Portland scored 60 points in the paint against Gobert and the defensive-minded Jazz. ""In the past they have affected us because we just know that Rudy Gobert is there and Derrick Favors is there and sometimes we sped up and sometimes we rushed it and missed shots,"" Lillard said. ""But tonight we delivered the passes and focused on finishing no matter who was around."" RUBIO RETURNS Rubio, who had been out since straining his hamstring in the first quarter against Milwaukee on Jan.7, returned to the court and it was none too soon for the Jazz. Besides Rubio, Dante Exum and Raul Neto have also been injured, forcing Mitchell to play the point. Even though Utah won all six games Rubio missed, coach Quin Snyder said before the game: ""There's just so many things that are subtle that he does on the floor. On-the-ball defense, probably since the early part of the year, has been one of the things (where) he's been solid. ... It's great to have him back. He's a competitor and we missed him."" Rubio, who was on a medical minutes restriction, scored 12 points in 14 minutes. ""Sometimes, it's frustrating. Tonight, I wish I would have played more minutes. But I know this is a marathon,"" he said.","401071374"
"TORONTO --  Even without Kawhi Leonard in the lineup, the rested Toronto Raptors were too much for the tired Sacramento Kings. Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet each scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam had 18 and the Raptors beat the Kings 120-105 on Tuesday night. Serge Ibaka had 15 points and 10 rebounds as the Raptors extended their home winning streak to 10 games. Toronto's franchise record for consecutive home wins is 12. C.J. Miles scored a season-high 15 points and Norm Powell added 11 as Toronto won for the eighth time in nine games. Leonard missed his third straight game for rest and will also skip Wednesday's game at Indiana, coach Nick Nurse said. Leonard is expected to return Friday at Houston. A two-time NBA defensive player of the year, Leonard was limited to nine games with San Antonio last season because of a quadriceps injury. Kings rookie Marvin Bagley scored a career-high 22 points and added 11 rebounds in his first career start. ""I'm really impressed with what he's done with his game,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""The sky is the limit for Marvin. He's going to be a heck of a player for us."" Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 16 points and Brady Hield had 15 as Sacramento lost for the third time in four games. The short-handed Kings were without three starters. Guard De'Aaron Fox sat because of a sore right toe, while forward Nemanja Bjelica was out because of a sore back. Forward Iman Shumpert sat out to rest. Shumpert made one of 10 shots in Monday's loss at Brooklyn. Sacramento dropped to 3-7 in the second game of a back-to-back, and Joerger acknowledged his team ran out of gas late. ""It caught us at the end there,"" Joerger said. ""We had some turnovers that were out of fatigue, especially Bogdanovic. He's a pretty sharp dude and I ran him too long."" The Kings missed all six of their 3-point attempts in the fourth and allowed 12 second chance points in the final frame. The Raptors, meanwhile, improved to an NBA-best 7-0 when playing with at least one day of rest and facing an opponent on the second night of a back-to-back. Toronto is 3-0 at home and 4-0 on the road in such games. San Antonio (5-0) and Brooklyn (4-0) are the only other teams without a loss in those circumstances. Both have played all such games at home. Toronto trailed 34-29 after one quarter, but Ibaka scored seven points in the second to give the Raptors a 60-56 edge at halftime. ""They came out and kind of jumped us a little bit,"" Lowry said. ""They were kind of fresher. As the game went on, we kind caught our second wind."" Willie Cauley-Stein's dunk with 4:35 left in the third tied the score at 73-all, but Siakam had seven points as Toronto closed the quarter with a 15-5 run, taking an 88-78 lead into the fourth. WINNING WITHOUT KAWHI The Raptors are 11-2 when Leonard does not play. ON A ROLL Miles has scored 10 or more points in three straight games. He hadn't scored in double figures in consecutive games this season before the current streak. TIP-INS Kings: Bogdanovic and Yogi Ferrell also started for the Kings. ... All five starters scored at least 10 points. ... Bogdanovic had nine assists and eight rebounds. Raptors: F OG Anunoby (personal reasons) was absent for the fourth straight game. Nurse said Anunoby is expected to return Friday. ... Lowry led the Raptors with nine assists. ... Toronto is 14-5 against Western Conference opponents. ... The Raptors outscored the Kings 24-12 in second-chance points.","401071375"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  A renewed focus on defense has the Oklahoma City Thunder on another winning streak. Paul George had 36 points, eight rebounds and five steals, Russell Westbrook had a triple-double of 29 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds and the Thunder beat the Portland Trail Blazers 123-114 on Tuesday night. Steven Adams and Terrance Ferguson each added 14 points for Oklahoma City, which snapped a three-game losing streak to Portland at Chesapeake Energy Arena. After a stretch of losing five of six games, during which they gave up 154, 142 and 138 points in defeats, the Thunder have won three straight and moved back into third place in the fluid Western Conference standings. Damian Lillard had 34 points and eight assists, and C.J. McCollum scored 31 for Portland, which committed 19 turnovers -- five more than its average -- and had a three-game winning streak snapped. Jusuf Nurkic had 22 points and 15 rebounds. Sixteen of those Portland turnovers came on Thunder steals. George -- who ranks second in the NBA (behind Westbrook) in steals at 2.33 per game -- led the way, and Ferguson added four steals, many of which led to points at the other end for Oklahoma City. ""That's what we lean on -- our size, our length, our ability to be able to make it tough for 48 minutes,"" Westbrook said. ""Eventually we wear out teams."" Except for McCollum, who went 7 of 12 from 3-point range, the Blazers struggled from behind the arc, going 10 for 36. Oklahoma City hit 11 of 23 3-point attempts. ""They've been shooting the three well in recent games,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said of the Thunder. ""That made the difference, but I thought the biggest difference in the game was our turnovers that they created. The two quarters that we lost, we had six turnovers in each of those quarters and that just fueled their runs."" McCollum's seventh 3-pointer, with 5:07 left, pulled Portland within 109-106, but George keyed a game-sealing run by the Thunder, hitting four free throws and then stealing a pass intended for Nurkic and going for a layup to extend Oklahoma City's lead to 117-108 with 2:17 left. Westbrook capped the win with a pair of ferocious dunks in the final 1:24. Oklahoma City led almost all the way -- trailing for less than 30 seconds -- but Portland never let the Thunder become comfortable. Through three quarters, only once did the Thunder push their lead to double digits, and that was 11 points late in the second quarter. The Thunder hit 8 of 14 3-point attempts in the first two periods on the way to a 62-55 halftime lead. George was 3 of 5 from long range and had 20 points. McCollum hit five of his 3-pointers in the third quarter, twice pulling Portland within a point, but the Thunder held their lead and were ahead entering the fourth quarter. Dennis Schroder keyed an 8-0 run by Oklahoma City early in the fourth quarter that put the Thunder ahead 101-89, but the Blazers scored seven straight to narrow the gap. Schroder scored 13 points for the Thunder. ROCK THE BABY Westbrook, the father of 2-month-old twin daughters, often does his ""rock the baby"" move -- moving his arms back and forth as if cradling an infant  -- after a big play. Portland's Evan Turner mimicked that move after a first-quarter basket, but Westbrook claimed not to notice. ""I didn't even see it, honestly,"" Westbrook said. ""I didn't see it. He can rock right back to Portland."" TIP-INS: Trail Blazers: Portland had the second-fewest turnovers in the NBA (12.2) over the previous 12 games, but had 19 against the Thunder. ... McCollum's seven 3-pointers increased his career total to 756, passing Nicolas Batum (751) for fourth on the franchise's all-time list. ... Nurkic has scored at least 17 in seven of his last eight games against Oklahoma City. Thunder: G Alex Abrines was active for a second straight game, but did not play. He missed the previous 13 games due first to illness, then personal reasons. ... Westbrook's triple-double was his 14th this season and the 118th of his career. . The Thunder's bench produced only 19 points.","401071376"
"DALLAS --  Dennis Smith Jr. faked a pass and hit a layup in one sweeping motion a few minutes before Luka Doncic dribbled behind his back at the free-throw line and drove for a left-handed layup. The Dallas Mavericks are back to trying to figure out how to make the two young stars fit in the same backcourt. Smith had 17 points and eight rebounds in his return after a week away from the team amid trade talk, and the Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106-98 on Tuesday night. Smith had two of his four assists on a layup and alley-oop dunk in the fourth quarter for DeAndre Jordan, who had 13 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks in his third game against the team with which the 6-foot-11 center from Texas spent his first 10 seasons. ""I thought he was great, just really tremendous, and everything we needed: speed, attacking, shot-making, a couple of amazing assists,"" coach Rick Carlisle said of Smith. ""It has been tough for him, being away from his teammates, and he played one of his best games since he has been here."" A 21-year-old in his second season, Smith's future and role with the Mavericks is already in doubt because of the sudden emergence of Doncic. Smith was the unquestioned starting point guard during a solid rookie season, but Doncic brings many of the same qualities, more polished because of the 19-year-old rookie sensation's experience as a young pro in Europe. The Slovenian is Dallas' leading scorer. After missing six games under increasingly questionable circumstances with trade talk percolating, Smith returned -- and was immediately restored as a starter by Carlisle alongside Doncic, who matched Smith with 17 points. ""It shouldn't happen,"" Doncic said of the absence of a teammate he considers a friend. ""It's bad for a team."" Smith stayed away for three games -- the previous home game last Wednesday and a two-game road trip. Back stiffness was the official reason for the first three games Smith missed, but that changed to illness while he was absent. Carlisle said on his radio show last week that he believed Smith's representatives were advising him to stay away. ""It was tough,"" Smith said, changing the topic to the game for each question about his absence. ""But you know things happen. We got a win tonight and that's the important thing."" Patrick Beverley scored 16 points while Avery Bradley and Lou Williams had 15 apiece for the Clippers, who lost for the sixth time in seven games coming off a win in San Antonio that ended a season-long five-game losing streak. The Clippers missed 16 straight shots in the second half, including their last 15 of the third quarter. But they still led 88-83 in the fourth before going 4 of 16 to finish the game. They shot 36 percent overall. ""We had wide-open shots tonight. They just didn't go in,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""So every once in a while you'll have that game."" Harrison Barnes stopped a recent 3-point shooting slump by making three of five from long range, including one for the biggest Dallas lead at nine points with less than a minute remaining. Barnes scored 20 points in just the third win in 10 games for the Mavericks. Smith and Doncic shared the floor for the final 2:14, with Smith starting that stretch with a long pass to Jordan for the dunk. Soon after, Doncic worked methodically for a jumper for a 101-93 lead with 1:22 to go. TIP-INS Clippers: Williams returned after missing two games with a hamstring issue. He was 5 of 16 from the field, including 1 of 6 from 3. ... Leading scorer Danilo Gallinari missed his second straight game with back spasms. Mavericks: G Wesley Matthews made one of four from 3-point range and needs two more to become the first undrafted player with 1,500 career 3-pointers. ... Doncic had seven rebounds and six assists. ... Dirk Nowitzki, in his record 21st season with the same franchise, made two of four from long range and finished with eight points. The 40-year-old played 10 minutes, right on his season average. ROUGH SHOOTING IN WIN Doncic and Smith struggled from long range, combining to go 1 of 14 with several shots that missed the rim. Doncic had his third straight rough shooting night, going 5 of 15 to put him at 14 of 46 (30 percent) over the past three games. Smith was 6 of 17.","401071377"
"PHOENIX --  Two days earlier, the short-handed Phoenix Suns gave Minnesota everything it could handle in a two-point road loss to the Timberwolves. On Tuesday night, it was no contest. A Minnesota blowout in the desert. Karl-Anthony Towns had 25 points, 18 rebounds and seven assists, rookie Josh Okogie scored a career-best 21 and the Timberwolves rolled 118-91. ""It's a great thing to have a rookie like Josh play as well as he did,"" Towns said. ""He came in and played with a lot of energy and gave us a spark and you can't ask any more from him. He's doing a great job all year."" Minnesota needed Derrick Rose's driving bank shot at the buzzer to beat Phoenix 116-114 in Minneapolis on Sunday. In both games, Phoenix was without centers Deandre Ayton (left ankle sprain) and Richaun Holmes (right foot sprain). To make matters worse for the Suns, T.J. Warren didn't play in the second half due to a sore right ankle. And there's Devin Booker, who scored 14 for Phoenix before he and Minnesota's Gorgui Deng were ejected with 5:24 left in the third quarter. Phoenix already trailed by 20 by then. Josh Jackson had a season-high 27 points and 10 rebounds for Phoenix, which lost its fifth straight. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 13 and Dragan Bender, who started at center, had 13 points and 10 boards. Andrew Wiggins scored 17 and Jared Bayless 14 for Minnesota. It was a far cry from the tight game the teams played two days earlier. The Suns never led and were down by as many as 30 in the second half. ""I think that was the first time since I was moved into this role that I was able to sit down towards the end (of the game) a little more,"" said Minnesota interim coach Ryan Saunders, who took over when Tom Thibodeau was fired just over two weeks ago. Phoenix trailed only 44-42 after Bender's 3-pointer midway through the second quarter but the Timberwolves outscored the Suns 20-7 the final 6:33 of the half to lead 64-49 at the break. Towns had 20 points and 11 rebounds in the first quarters. Minnesota stretched it to 80-60 on Bayless' fourth 3 of the night with 6:52 left in the third quarter. ""I felt we were just too late to the game,"" Jackson said. ""They were into a rhythm."" UGLY MOOD The Timberwolves led 82-62 with 5:24 left in the third quarter when Booker and Dieng got into a brief altercation, with Booker getting knocked down and responding with a hand to Dieng's face. After a video review, both were ejected. Since Booker is averaging 24.5 points per game and Dieng 5.4, Minnesota got the obvious advantage of that one. A security guard accompanied the irate Booker off the court and into the locker room, holding the Suns star player by the jersey to keep him from heading down the hall toward the visitors' locker room. ""He talked to me, I talked to him back,"" Dieng said. ""I think he tried to hit me. Everybody could see I didn't throw a punch. In this league a lot of guys think they are tough and they are not."" Booker left without talking to reporters. TIP INS Timberwolves: Jeff Teague missed the game with left foot soreness. ... Tyus Jones missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... Timberwolves have another pair of consecutive games against the same opponent next week, against Utah on Friday and Sunday. ... Minnesota has won six of nine games. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS --  A promising season for the Indiana Pacers was instantly transformed when Victor Oladipo's leg buckled and he fell to the floor in pain. Indiana showed earlier this season it can win without the All-Star guard, at least in the short term. Now, the third-best team in the Eastern Conference may have to push ahead without him for a much longer stretch. Oladipo was carried off the court on a stretcher during the second quarter of the Pacers' 110-106 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night with a serious right knee injury. He is scheduled for an MRI on Thursday. ""It is a serious injury and we'll know more after the MRI,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""We're not going to speculate. It's a tough situation. That kid has a beautiful spirit about him. He has always been one to try and to lift us up. We've got to lift him now."" Oladipo was injured as he scrambled to defend an outlet pass to Toronto's Pascal Siakam and crumpled to the floor awkwardly . The severity was evident almost immediately as trainers draped a towel over the leg and players from both teams surrounded Oladipo while he was down. No replays were shown on the video screen that stretches from free-throw line to free-throw line, and fans began chanting Oladipo's name. When he did leave the court, Oladipo received a standing ovation and responded by waving to the crowd. ""I didn't see what happened,"" Siakam said. ""Watching the replay, he stuck his leg while he was falling. That's when he hit me. It's just an unfortunate situation. It's really scary, it's tough."" Losing Oladipo would be an enormous blow to the Pacers' playoff hopes. He leads Indiana in scoring at 19.2 points per game and has emerged as a leader. But after going 0-6 without Oladipo last season, the Pacers went 7-4 without their best player as he recovered from a sore right knee in November and December. And they still managed to hang on for their third straight victory Wednesday night -- their first over Toronto in six tries. ""We've got to come together and play inspired basketball,"" said Myles Turner, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds. ""We can't let this get us stuck in the mud. It's emotional, but we have to overcome it and play."" It didn't take long for supportive messages to start pouring in from around the league on social media. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , Phoenix guard Devin Booker, Washington guard Bradley Beal and Oklahoma City's Paul George were among the first to respond. Oladipo was acquired in a trade for George in the summer of 2017. ""Prayers up VO,"" George wrote on Twitter, with four sets of the praying hand emoji to emphasize his point. Thaddeus Young had 23 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Pacers, while Darren Collison added 16 points. Toronto was led by Serge Ibaka with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Kyle Lowry with 20 points. The Raptors again played without Kawhi Leonard, O.G. Anunoby or Jonas Valanciunas, but still made things tough for Indiana following the injury. After jumping to a 24-16 lead at the end of one quarter, extending the margin to 30-10 early in the second and finishing the half on a 9-4 run to make it 59-47 at the half, the Pacers fended off the Raptors' late charges. Toronto got as close as 98-97 after Ibaka made a 5-footer with 4:20 to play. But Young answered with a three-point play and the Pacers made just enough plays down the stretch to hold on. ""It's unfortunate,"" Collison told the crowd. ""We've got to keep going for him."""" TIP-INS Raptors: Six players scored in double figures. ... Toronto was 12 of 39 on 3s. ... The Raptors had won three straight without Anunoby, Leonard and Valanciunas. ... Toronto dropped to 8-2 on the second night of back-to-backs and 11-3 this season without Leonard. ...

Now, they look ahead to a showdown with defending champion Golden State at TD Garden on Saturday night. ""We have a great test Saturday and we'll learn more about us,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""We're not where we want to be at this point."" Jaylen Brown scored 23 points, Gordon Hayward 18 and Jayson Tatum 15 for Boston, which won its 10th straight at home. Rozier, who added eight rebounds and six assists, started in place of the ill Kyrie Irving and shot 6 for 6 and scored 16 points in the opening quarter. He made his only two shots in the second -- both 3-pointers -- including a 31-foot buzzer-beater from the top of the key that gave Boston a 65-50 halftime lead. Rozier said he found out via text from Irving in the morning that he was going to start, which helped him get ""mentally prepared."" Irving was sidelined with flu-like symptoms, and Boston was also without Al Horford, who was given the night off to rest and be fresh for the Warriors. Horford had missed seven games in December with a sore left knee before they built his minutes back up. When asked about team's winning streak at home, Rozier said: ""That's a big one to get 11 in a row. We know how big this game is."" Cedi Osman led the Cavaliers with a career-high 25 points and eight rebounds, and Ante Zizic had 19 points with eight boards. Cleveland has lost five in a row and 17 of its last 18. The Cavaliers might have been in town, but a good number of fans at might have been already looking ahead to Saturday's game with the Warriors. It was relatively quiet until Boston took charge with a 27-11 run to close the second quarter, pushing its lead from two to 15 at the half. ""I thought they sped us up a little bit,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""You know we had a real good pace going at the beginning. Second quarter, I thought their pressure kind of sped us up. We took some bad shots, we turned the basketball over and on the road you just can't do that, particularly against a good team."" Marcus Smart started the spree, hitting a 3-pointer -- one of five the Celtics had in the run. Rozier had two, the last coming just before the buzzer, bringing the crowd to its feet. In the second half, Robert Williams' basket pushed Boston's lead to 86-67 late in the third quarter. It was 12 points entering the final quarter and early garbage time after the Celtics opened the fourth by scoring the first seven points. TIP-INS Cavaliers: They were missing a few veteran players: Kevin Love (surgery, left foot), Larry Nance Jr. (sprained right knee), Tristan Thompson (left foot soreness) were not with the team. ... Fell to 4-22 on the road. Celtics: Stevens said his team has gotten a boost from Aron Baynes, who started for Horford. ""His spirit is felt,"" Stevens said before the game. ""You can feel it in practice, you can feel it just around the gym."" The 6-foot-10 center played in his fifth game after missing the previous 13 with a broken left finger. ... Improved to 19-5 at home. MYSTERY BASKET About 45 minutes after the game ended, the Celtics PR staff informed the media that the final score was changed to 123-103 and a basket was taken away from Tatum. The team said due to a computer glitch, he was credited with a basket in the fourth quarter, but the NBA reviewed the tape and it never occurred. The change didn't affect any of the day's listed betting lines on total points or the game's spread. STEPPIN' RIGHT IN Rozier was the first Celtics player to score 20 or more points in a half on perfect shooting since Paul Pierce went 7 for 7 and had 20 in the second half against Chicago on Oct. 30, 2009, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Last season, the 6-foot-1 guard was a spark in Boston's run to the Eastern Conference finals, averaging 16.5 points per game when Irving was lost before the playoffs with a knee injury, earning him the nickname ""Scary Terry."" ""You can say it's one of my better starts."" Rozier said of the opening quarter. NICE TOUCH Osman was 8-for-11 from the field, making 6 of 7 3-point attempts. ""I would say I was feeling good today about my shots,"" he said.","401071380"
"NEW YORK --  D'Angelo Russell could very well make his first NBA All-Star game appearance next month in Charlotte. After yet another big offensive performance for the surging Brooklyn Nets, the young point guard was quick to credit a key defensive play by one of his teammates. Russell had a double-double with 25 points and 10 rebounds, Spencer Dinwiddie scored 29 points, and the Nets edged the Orlando Magic 114-110 on Wednesday night for their fifth straight victory. But it perhaps wouldn't have been possible had Joe Harris not stepped in. The reserve guard took a charge as the 7-foot Nikola Vucevic barreled in for a potential basket that would have cut Brooklyn's lead to one point with 1:25 remaining in regulation. ""That's a winning play right there,"" Russell said. ""He doesn't make that play, they get a layup or a foul and it changes the game -- but that's the icing on the cake right there."" Said Harris: ""We call it M.I.G. mentality -- it's the `most important guy.' So, it's the opposite wing defender, and I was just on the opposite block."" Vucevic's tough night continued and cost Orlando a chance at possibly sending the game into overtime. The Magic had a chance to tie it at 112 with 3.1 seconds left in regulation, but Vucevic's basket was waved off after replay review confirmed that the Magic center had actually tipped in the ball while it was still on the rim after Evan Fournier had beaten Brooklyn's Jarrett Allen to the hoop. ""I thought it was already coming out. It's really like split-second, it's hard,"" Vucevic said. ""Two, three plays before, I tipped the ball in their own basket, so it just happens."" Russell, who also had seven assists, hit a pair of free throws with 2.4 seconds remaining to seal it for the Nets, who have won seven consecutive games at the Barclays Center. DeMarre Carroll added 19 points for Brooklyn. ""It's becoming routine and I think we have that belief that we can win more so than we have in my tenure here,"" Dinwiddie said. Vucevic had a double-double with 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Magic, who have lost eight of their last 11. D.J. Augustin added 19 points and Jonathan Isaac scored 16. Trailing 104-102 with 4:36 remaining in regulation, Brooklyn went on a 7-0 run that was capped by Carroll's 3-pointer with 2:42 left in the fourth quarter to go up 109-104. Augustin then made a layup to cut the deficit to 109-106 before Vucevic made another costly mistake for the Magic. Carroll drove inside the paint and missed his shot, but Vucevic tipped the ball in to increase Brooklyn's lead to 111-106 with 40.7 seconds remaining. After calling a timeout, the Magic scored four straight, making it 111-110 after Jonathon Simmons' pair of free throws with 21.7 to go. TIP INS Magic: G Isaiah Briscoe sprained his left ankle with four minutes left in the first quarter and did not return. Nets: F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson strained his left shoulder while battling for a rebound late in the third quarter. He immediately walked off the court as soon as the Nets called a timeout with 3:11 remaining in the period. ... Dinwiddie has scored at least 25 points off the bench in 10 games this season, matching a franchise single-season record. Bubbles Hawkins set the mark during the Nets' inaugural NBA season (1976-77). . The Nets bench outscored Orlando's reserves 52-35 RIGHT COMBINATION Dinwiddie and Russell have each tallied over 20 points in the same game four times this season, including twice against the Magic. The Brooklyn backcourt tandem combined for 30 points in the second half. ""I see more as they are meshing. More and more every time,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I know advanced stuff says they don't play well together, but they're going to be in at the end of the game.""","401071381"
"MIAMI --  The Los Angeles Clippers know that little was expected of them this season. They're still fighting to prove doubters wrong. Tobias Harris scored 22 of his 31 points in the first half, and the Clippers clamped down on defense after intermission to beat the Miami Heat 111-99 on Wednesday night. ""We embrace it as a group,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, whose team is eighth in the loaded Western Conference even after a recent slide. ""We heard all the talk. We're pretty good. We have a lot of good players. We don't have a superstar, though Tobias is slowly trying to change the narrative on that. But we have a lot of good guys that can play the game, and what we have most is team toughness."" Montrezl Harrell scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for the Clippers, who outscored Miami 44-26 in the first 20 minutes of the second half. Lou Williams added 13 points and Avery Bradley scored 12, while Harris had seven rebounds and six assists for the Clippers. ""Right from the beginning I liked our energy and I liked our pace,"" Harris said. Hassan Whiteside finished with 22 points and 16 rebounds for Miami. Josh Richardson scored 17 points, Tyler Johnson added 15 and Dwyane Wade scored 13 for the Heat. The Heat lost by 12 -- the exact margin in which they were outscored in second-chance points, 21-9. ""We had breakdown after breakdown defensively,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of the fourth quarter. ""You have to give them credit. They made the necessary plays and we paid the price."" Wade has scored at least 13 points by halftime four times this season -- twice against the Clippers. But he went scoreless after the break, and the rest of his teammates didn't exactly fare much better in the final two quarters. ""Our offense wasn't good in the second half,"" Wade said. ""I felt like, defensive-wise, we were doing solid defensively. But offensively, we couldn't muster up enough points. You need defense and you need offense."" The teams were tied at 54 at the half, both shooting exactly 50 percent and pinballing their way through six lead changes and seven ties. The first time the Clippers had more than a one-possession lead was midway through the third, when a short jumper by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put them up by five. Los Angeles held Miami to 18 points in the third, and opened up a 98-80 lead with 4:30 left -- the cue for most fans to head to the exits. TIP-INS Clippers: The Clippers are 4-1 in their last five trips to Miami. ... Danilo Gallinari (back) missed his third consecutive game. ... Mike Fratello worked the Clippers' broadcast alongside legendary play-by-play man Ralph Lawler. Fratello, now a broadcaster with the Brooklyn Nets, started his TV career with the Clippers in 1990. Lawler is retiring at the end of this, his 40th season with the club. Heat: James Johnson was dealing with a migraine during the day, but started for Miami. ... Wade exchanged jerseys postgame with Jason Williams, the point guard on the 2006 Miami championship team. Wade got a Sacramento No. 55 jersey from Williams. He also got a bottle of wine from Fratello. ... Whiteside went 1 for 2 on a trip to the line in the third quarter, ending a streak of 14 straight missed free throws by the Heat center. SPOELSTRA PASSES RILEY The game was the 850th as Miami's coach for Spoelstra, one more than Pat Riley had during his tenure on the Heat sideline. Spoelstra is the 13th coach in NBA history to have at least 850 games with one team; the most recent entrant into that club was Rick Carlisle, who coached his 850th game with Dallas on Monday in Milwaukee. RIVERS PAYS TRIBUTE Rivers played his college ball at Marquette, which is why he has insisted for years that Wade is the second-best player in school history -- a half-serious claim that he's offered many times and repeated Wednesday. ""As good as he's been as a player, he sets a great example of how to conduct yourself off the floor,"" Rivers said. Wade and Rivers had a long postgame embrace.","401071382"
"NEW YORK --  James Harden inched past Wilt Chamberlain and didn't stop his latest one-man show until he'd tied Kobe Bryant. On another spectacular night for the NBA's most sensational scorer, Harden not only notched his career high with 61 points, but tied Bryant's record for a visiting player at the current Madison Square Garden. ""In the Garden, I'll take it,"" Harden said. The Rockets sure needed it. Harden made the clinching layup with 3.8 seconds remaining after the Knicks turned it over, and the Rockets edged the New York Knicks 114-110 on Wednesday night. With his final basket, Harden capped his fifth 50-point game this season and a wild stretch of back-and-forth basketball across the final minutes. ""The way we played in the last six minutes, maybe four minutes, we set basketball back at least 10 years,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It was mind-boggling the things we just did. We got the win."" Eric Gordon made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 9.8 seconds left when Houston couldn't get the ball to Harden, the NBA's leading scorer who earlier had passed Chamberlain into fourth place in NBA history with his 21st consecutive 30-point game. A day after saying he hadn't yet experienced his Madison Square Garden moment, Harden finished 17 of 38 from the floor. He was only 5 of 20 on 3-pointers but was 22 of 25 from the line and grabbed 15 rebounds in front of a crowd that cheered some of his long jumpers but then booed after he drew foul after foul. ""They couldn't figure out what they wanted to do,"" Harden said. ""But I appreciate them though, honestly. Tonight they kept me going and made the game exciting for me."" Carmelo Anthony holds the overall record at the current MSG with 62 points. Rookie Allonzo Trier scored a season-high 31 points for the Knicks, who lost their seventh straight game. They lost coach David Fizdale when he picked up his second technical foul and was ejected with 1:08 remaining. Fizdale said he didn't know why he was tossed, though referee Pat Fraher said it was for continuous complaining after he'd been warned, leading to a second tech for unsportsmanlike conduct. The Rockets led by 10 after three, but the Knicks quickly cut into it when Harden was on the bench. New York eventually took a couple late leads -- helped at one point when P.J. Tucker inexplicably refused to pick up Gordon's inbounds pass to allow a layup -- but couldn't hold on, losing for the 15th time in 16 games. Harden had already surpassed his average of 35.7 points by halftime, putting back the miss of his own shot to beat the buzzer and give himself 36 points and nine rebounds. Chamberlain still has all three 30-point streaks that were longer. His record is 65 straight, and he also had streaks of 31 and 25 games. Harden was outscoring the Knicks by himself for most of the first quarter before taking his first rest late in the period with 19 points. The Knicks moved into the lead by the end of the quarter and stayed there the remainder of the half, stretching the lead to 13 before the Rockets trimmed it to 63-58 at the break. TIP-INS Rockets: Chris Paul appears close to returning from a left hamstring strain. D'Antoni said it could be by the end of this week, with the Rockets next playing Friday at home against Toronto. If not, D'Antoni said it could be early next week. ... Kenneth Faried started in just his second game since joining the Rockets on Monday, scoring 11 points. Knicks: Fizdale said Luke Kornet's sprained left ankle could have been much worse, but that the center would still miss at least a couple weeks. ... Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 21 points. MAKING THEMSELVES AT HOME The Rockets beat the Knicks for the ninth straight time at MSG. New York's last home victory in the series was on Jan. 26, 2009, when D'Antoni was the Knicks' coach. Exactly a week later, Bryant scored his 61 points in a Lakers victory on Feb. 2. DNP FOR KANTER Even with Kornet out, former starting center Enes Kanter couldn't regain a spot in the rotation and was again frustrated as Fizdale remains committed to evaluating young players on his team, which fell to 10-36. ""They just told me this morning I am starting. The coach said himself today I am starting and now I come to the game and didn't play,"" Kanter said. ""I am trying to be a good teammate here, man. The whole league knows I am always with my teammates.""","401071383"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid stretched his balky back each time he had a moment's rest. Those vital health breaks were fleeting -- Embiid gutted out nearly 40 minutes, showing again that the days of the All-Star center missing seasons and stretches of games with injuries have become a faded memory. Embiid had 33 points and 19 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers used a pair of four-point plays in the fourth quarter to beat the San Antonio Spurs 122-120 on Wednesday night. ""He felt the responsibility to play,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""He's starting to get older and feel the weight of the responsibility. He understands his role in all of this, the growth of all of this, the ownership of all of this."" Embiid, expected to be named an All-Star starter on Thursday, shook off LaMarcus Aldridge and scored 16 straight points that kept the Sixers in the game. Landry Shamet ended Embiid's personal run with a four-point play late in the fourth that pulled the Sixers within one. After the Spurs nudged ahead, Shamet hit a 3 to make it a three-point game and JJ Redick gave the Sixers a 121-120 lead with 1 minute left after he converted Philadelphia's second four-point play of the fourth. The Spurs blew their chances to win: Philadelphia had a shot-clock violation, but DeMar DeRozan had his shot blocked by Wilson Chandler. ""I thought Wilson was maybe the main reason we won the game,"" Brown said. Corey Brewer went 1 of 2 from the free-throw line for a 122-120 lead with 1.1 seconds left. San Antonio's final shot at sending the game into overtime was denied when Ben Simmons broke up an inbound pass headed for Marco Belinelli, with DeRozan on the bench. ""We couldn't get one bucket to keep ahead and try to pull it out,"" DeRozan said. The packed house of 20,339 went wild as the Sixers closed on a 10-0 run while playing without star guard Jimmy Butler (sprained right wrist). Simmons had 21 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. Redick scored 19 points. DeRozan led the Spurs with 26 points. Embiid went 13 of 28 from the floor and had two 3-pointers. Embiid, who had his NBA-best 33rd game this season with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, hit a 3 from the top of the arc and connected on the tying free throws the next time down to send the game into the fourth tied 96-all. ""I told myself that I really needed to get going,"" Embiid said. ""For us to win, I had to show up. I did the best I could."" His best was good enough against the Spurs. The 76ers turned in the sequence of the half after Brewer's 3 made it 51-48. Jonah Bolden blocked Aldridge twice on the same sequence and Simmons grabbed a loose ball off the second rejection. He took off and fed it to Bolden for a crowd-igniting dunk on the other end. Redick followed with a 3 for a 56-48 lead that had the four-point favorite Sixers rolling. ""We had really good resolve anytime they made a run,"" Shamet said. TIP-INS Spurs: Belinelli, a former 76er, got a nice ovation when he checked into the game. 76ers: Simmons played with an upper respiratory infection. Embiid's back has bothered him for some time -- NBA broadcaster Charles Barkley ripped the Sixers' decision to play Embiid in a recent win over Indiana -- and there's no telling when it may get better. CELEB SIGHTINGS Rapper Biz Markie was in the house, and Phillies manager Gabe Kapler and players Aaron Nola and Rhys Hoskins rang the ceremonial bell. Former Spur David Robinson spent several minutes signing autographs for Sixers fans. PALESTRA POWER The Spurs held their shootaround at Philadelphia's Palestra, the historic gym known as the basketball cathedral on Penn's campus. ""This is what you're supposed to feel like when you play basketball,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""All these other arenas that we're all in, they don't do anything to your spirit. They don't make you feel anything. You don't fall in love."" NOVA NATION Villanova's Jay Wright will serve as an assistant coach under Popovich for Team USA. ""He's a helluva coach. He's a helluva guy. End of story,"" Popovich said. ""He's been pretty successful last time I checked."" HE SAID IT ""He's full of (expletive). That's why I got rid of him. Kiss-(expletive)."" -- Popovich, on Brown saying Pop's the greatest coach in NBA history. Popovich gave his former assistant a playful shove on the sideline late in the game.","401071384"
"CHICAGO --  John Collins was on the move for the Atlanta Hawks, all night long. He cut along the baseline for layups and dunks. He stepped out for 3-pointers. The Chicago Bulls just kept losing track of him. Collins scored a career-high 35 points, Trae Young had 12 assists and the Hawks beat the Bulls 121-101 on Wednesday. ""It's a big part of my game, moving without the basketball,"" Collins said. ""And like I said, I have unselfish guys on my team that are able to find me."" Collins was 14 for 16 from the field as Atlanta kicked off a season-high, seven-game trip with its first victory against Chicago in two years, stopping a five-game slide against the Bulls. Jeremy Lin, Young's backup, had 15 points, and Dewayne Dedmon finished with 14. The Hawks had a full practice on Tuesday for the first time in a while, and coach Lloyd Pierce felt like it helped. ""To carry that over to the game, I thought there was no surprise,"" he said. ""But very good performance for our guys tonight."" Chicago lost for the 11th time in its last 12 games. Zach LaVine scored 23 points, and Lauri Markkanen had 22 in the opener of a three-game homestand. ""We have to contest shots better,"" Markkanen said. ""We can score the ball, but we need to get some stops."" The Bulls trimmed a 20-point deficit all the way down to six when Markkanen made a 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer. But the Hawks pulled away with an 11-2 run at the end of the third quarter. Lin had seven points in the spurt, including a 3-pointer that lifted Atlanta to a 98-83 lead heading into the final period. Young, who finished with five points on 1-for-12 shooting, also made a 3 with 1:14 left. Chicago never made a serious charge in the fourth, and what was left of the crowd chanted ""We want Vince! We want Vince!"" in the final minutes in an effort to persuade Pierce to put Vince Carter in the game. The Hawks encouraged the fans by pointing and motioning toward Carter, who turns 42 on Saturday. But the veteran guard stayed on the bench. ""I walked down with about 7 minutes to go and I said, `Yes or no?' and it was the loudest no I heard all night,"" Pierce said, ""so I walked away. Yeah, you're not going to question Vince Carter on a move like that."" Taurean Prince also had 15 points for Atlanta, which had dropped three of four. Alex Len finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. NO MELO There was no sign of Carmelo Anthony, save for his name on Chicago's inactive list. The Bulls acquired the forward in a trade with Houston on Tuesday, but are planning to trade the 10-time All-Star before the Feb. 7 deadline or ultimately waive him and make him a free agent. Asked if his team might benefit from having Anthony around even for a short time, coach Jim Boylen said: ""We have not had those conversations and from what I understand is that's not the direction we're going to go."" BOOM Atlanta's 42-point first quarter included a terrific one-handed slam by Justin Anderson over Chicago's Bobby Portis, prompting Young and the Hawks on the bench to jump out of their seats. TIP-INS Hawks: Rookie G Kevin Huerter missed his second straight game with a sore neck. ""He just needs a little more time,"" Pierce said. ""The neck was still sore. No panic, no rush and nothing to be concerned about."" Bulls: Bulls F Jabari Parker was sidelined by a right patellar tendon strain. Boylen said he was told it happened during warmups. ""It's surprising to all of us and disappointing for him,"" Boylen said. ""We'll see how that shakes out. Hopefully, it's something that passes quickly."" ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Charlotte Hornets have used a nice run to keep a grasp on one of the final Eastern Conference playoff spots. Kemba Walker had 22 points and seven assists, Nicolas Batum scored 18 points, and the Hornets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 118-107 on Wednesday night for their fourth win in five games. Jeremy Lamb and Tony Parker had 17 points each for Charlotte, which moved into the seventh spot in the East, a half-game ahead of eighth-place Miami, which lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 111-99 Wednesday night. ""Our energy's been good. Our togetherness has really come back the way it was early in the season,"" Walker said. ""We're just playing hard, playing the game with great energy from start to finish."" While Charlotte is enjoying a nice run, Memphis continues to struggle both internally and on the court. The loss was the seventh straight for the Grizzlies and 13th in the past 14. The game was also the first since Grizzlies owner Robert Pera informed cornerstones Mike Conley and Marc Gasol they may be traded. The two Memphis stars did their jobs -- Gasol with a triple-double on 22 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists, and Conley adding 31 points -- but the Grizzlies couldn't threaten in the fourth quarter. Charlotte shot 53 percent from the field, including 12 of 30 from outside the arc. That included Batum converting 4 of 6 from 3-point range. ""I think defensively, we weren't very good,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Every time you looked up, they were in our paint. ... I think we scored enough points to win, but giving up 118 points, you don't give yourself a shot."" Jaren Jackson Jr. added 15 points for Memphis, and JaMychal Green finished with 14. Charlotte, which led 86-76 after three, never let the Grizzlies get closer than eight in the final quarter. Walker scored 15 of his points in the frame, keeping Memphis from getting closer down the stretch ""He's special. He does that in the fourth quarter when the pressure is on,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""That is his time to shine, and that's what All-Stars do -- top level players like him perform in those times."" TIP-INS Hornets: Batum's 3-pointer in the first quarter moved him past Deron Williams for 66th on the NBA's career 3-point list with 1,180. ... Marvin Williams passed Rex Chapman for 12th on the franchise's scoring list. ... Parker has reached double figures in scoring three of the past four games. ... The Hornets reserves outscored Memphis' bench players 41-24. Charlotte's subs average 44.5 points a game, third-best in the league. Grizzlies: Gasol recorded his fifth career double-double. ... The game started on time despite an electrical fire near the sauna in the Grizzlies locker room about three hours before game time, leaving a distinct smoky smell in FedExForum. ... Memphis was moved from its locker room to the Memphis Tigers dressing area. ... Conley had 15 points in the fourth quarter, matching his season-best scoring in the final frame. .Jackson reached double figures for the fourth-straight game. TRADE TALK Before the game, Conley and Gasol addressed reports that Memphis planned to shop the duo, both of whom have been with Memphis their entire NBA careers. Neither expressed a desire to leave the franchise. Gasol said he didn't ask for a trade, and when asked if he was surprised by the reports, he replied: ""Uh, Irrelevant."" Conley said there was no indication that an eventual trade is a done-deal. ""It was just making us aware that our names would be thrown out there,"" he said. ""Not that one of us or both of us are going to be gone by next Tuesday or by All-Star break. I feel just as good about being here as the next person. I'm not worried right now.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Blake Griffin got Detroit off to a hot start, but the Pistons still had to scratch out a victory in the final seconds over the Anthony Davis-less Pelicans. It didn't sit well with the All-Star forward. ""The way we finished the game was the reason we've lost so many close games,"" said Griffin, referring to Detroit's 95-87 lead with 1:32 left that nearly evaporated down the stretch. ""This time we just happened to come out on top. We got a lucky miss, a lucky bounce and we were able to get a wide-open dunk, but this doesn't feel like that good of a win. Obviously, we'll take it, but stuff like this is why we've lost so many games."" Griffin scored 20 of his game-high 37 points in the fourth quarter of Detroit's 98-94 win over New Orleans, which was playing its second straight game without Davis. Reggie Jackson added 17 points for the Pistons, who had lost seven of their previous 10. Jrue Holiday scored 29 points and Jahlil Okafor added 17 for the Pelicans, who have lost four of six. New Orleans cut the deficit to 95-92 on a drive by Holiday and a 3-poitner by Darius Miller with 52.5 seconds left. The Pistons then had a sluggish possession, finally getting the ball in Griffin's hands for a forced 3-point attempt. When he missed, the Pelicans had a chance to tie, but Frank Jackson's open 3-pointer missed, and Holiday tapped the rebound out to the top of the key. Reggie Bullock ran down the loose ball and dribbled 60 feet unguarded for a clinching dunk with 14.5 seconds left. Griffin finished 14 of 28 from the field, including 4 of 9 on 3-pointers, and had nine rebounds and seven assists. ""He's carrying us, handling the basketball, making good decisions, just doing everything we could ask a franchise player to do,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""He's been great. He sets the tone for us offensively. He'd probably have more assists if we knocked down more shots."" Detroit went 7 of 23 from the field in the fourth quarter, scoring just 19 points in the frame. ""You want to finish perfect, and I'm striving for perfection and good habits,"" Casey said. Playing without Davis, the Pelicans shot just nine free throws and made only four. ""We just struggled the whole night,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""At the end, we make a push back. You've got to be able to make the game-winning plays, as we call them. We didn't do that. We have failed to find consistency throughout what we're trying to do. That's a lot on me. As a coach, you've got to figure out a way to have your team play consistently and you've got to find out who is willing to do that. We're kind of still searching for that."" Griffin scored 20 of Detroit's 31 points in the first quarter and had 26 by halftime on 9-of-14 shooting, with the Pistons leading 57-47.

"Paul Pierce and Stan Van Gundy predict whether Nikola Jokic will be suspended for leaving the bench during Mason Plumlee and Derrick Favors' scuffle. (1:49) SALT LAKE CITY --  Once Utah got warmed up on the perimeter, Denver couldn't do anything to cool the Jazz. The long-distance barrage kept the Nuggets on their heels for the better part of four quarters and allowed Utah to scratch out a 114-108 win Wednesday night. Utah made 13 3-pointers before halftime -- a franchise record for any half -- and finished 19-of-46 (.413) from 3-point range. ""We knew they were going to be aggressive at the point of the pick and roll,"" forward Jae Crowder said. ""That's what happened in the first half. We just moved the ball properly and got open shots and guys knocked them down."" Donovan Mitchell made a season-high six 3-pointers and scored 35 points. He also dished out six assists. That sort of stat line became a common theme among the Jazz players. Joe Ingles scored 14 points while hitting four 3-pointers and adding eight assists. Ricky Rubio hit a couple of clutch 3-pointers in the first half and finished with 17 points and six assists. Jazz coach Quin Snyder credited Rubio with guiding the offense with a steady hand and spreading an unselfish mentality among his teammates. ""For us to have three guys with six, six, and eight assists speaks a lot to how we were moving the ball,"" Snyder said. ""Guys were spacing and ready to shoot the ball."" Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 11 rebounds and Crowder also finished with 15 points for Utah, which won for the ninth time in 11 games. Nikola Jokic scored 28 points and had 21 rebounds and six assists to lead the Nuggets, whose two-game winning streak ended despite shooting 42 of 88 -- 48 percent -- from the field. Will Barton added 22 points and a season-high nine rebounds. ""Some of us were not mentally ready to play this game,"" Denver coach Micheal Malone said. ""Some of us were not in tune to what we were trying to do defensively. We had breakdown after breakdown after breakdown."" The Nuggets, who fell behind by double-digits in the first quarter, closed the gap and briefly overtook the Jazz when Barton made back-to-back baskets to cap a 9-0 run and give Denver a 31-30 lead early in the second quarter. It didn't last long. Rubio and Gobert scored on back-to-back plays to put Utah back in front less than a minute later. Denver tied it twice as the second quarter progressed, but the Jazz answered with seven 3-pointers over the final eight minutes of the half to stay in front. Mitchell scored four of those outside baskets and his final one of the quarter put Utah ahead 63-55. Mitchell said making better reads on each play has helped him knock down shots in January that he didn't make in October, November, and December. ""At the beginning of the year, I took tougher shots in all aspects,"" Mitchell said. ""That's my mindset. Making it easier on myself. Finding the open guys and then I create lanes for myself."" The Jazz shot 13 of 27 (.481) from the perimeter in the first half. Denver stayed within striking distance by getting nine baskets in the paint in both quarters. The Nuggets scored 36 points in the paint before halftime. Utah didn't cool enough from outside in the second half for it to have the effect Denver wanted. Rubio and Mitchell bookended an 11-2 run with 3-pointers that put the Jazz up 79-64 midway through the third quarter. The Nuggets rallied and closed to within four at 111-107 on Barton's 3 with 1:27 remaining. Gobert hit a pair of free throws on the other end, and then Mitchell blocked a layup attempt by Torrey Craig with 43.6 seconds left to help Utah halt the rally. ""We played the right way, but in some moments we had some breakdowns,"" Jokic said. DOUBLE EJECTION The game got a bit heated early when Utah's Derrick Favors and Denver's Mason Plumlee were both ejected with 2:46 left in the first quarter. The two shoved each either under the Nuggets basket, leading to more shoving from multiple players on both teams. Favors and Plumlee each received a technical foul, as did Utah's Royce O'Neale and Denver's Will Barton for pushing and shoving in the scrum. Favors finished with two rebounds and zero points in five minutes. Plumlee tallied two points, a rebound and a block in four minutes. INSIDE IMPACT Jokic recorded his second 25-20 game of the season while posting his 14th double-double in the Nuggets' last 19 games. He also finished with a team-high six assists. QUOTABLE ""I feel like we can beat anybody in the league, obviously, when we play the right way. We have a game plan for it. Our coaches do a very good job of preparing us and we're very confident in ourselves, our work, and how we approach the game."" -- Crowder on Utah's strong offensive performance. TIP INS Nuggets: Barton dished out a season-high five assists. He's averaging 3.0 assists over his last five games. ... Denver gave up 21 points on 16 turnovers. ... Craig posted a career-high four blocks. ... Denver outscored Utah 54-32 in the paint. Jazz: Mitchell has scored at least 30 points in five of his last eight games.

"WASHINGTON --  Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors saw a weakness and changed their style to exploit it. When the Washington Wizards took the 3-point line away, Curry and the Warriors pounded the ball inside on the way to a 126-118 victory Thursday night that extended their winning streak to a season-high nine games. Curry scored 38 points at the forefront of Golden State's drive-the-paint strategy, making just two of his eight 3-point attempts and going 12 of 16 inside the arc. ""Got to take what the defense gives you,"" Curry said. ""I think for the most part we moved the ball early and got everybody established. And then the lane starts to open up, and you've got to take advantage of it some nights."" The two-time defending NBA champions put up 70 points in the paint after shooting 1 of 6 from the outside in the first quarter. Center DeMarcus Cousins had 17 points in 24 minutes in his third game with the Warriors since missing almost a full year with a ruptured left Achilles tendon. Cousins was a matchup nightmare in the post against Washington, which went with a small lineup for most of the night. ""It's not something we've really practiced a lot, so we kind of just threw it out there and tried to do it on the fly,"" Cousins said of going inside so much. ""We were successful in some moments and then we kind of got on top of each other and it got a little sloppy. I'm sure that's something we'll work on going forward."" Kevin Durant, who's from nearby Suitland, Maryland, scored 21 points. Trevor Ariza led the Wizards with a season-high 27 points and Bradley Beal had 22 points as their two-game winning streak came to an end. ""I think we're turning a corner,"" Beal said. ""We're still not there yet. We still have to dig ourselves out of this hole that we're in. There's only a short amount of time to do it, but we have a great opportunity in front of us."" After the Warriors led by 12 after three quarters, the Wizards went on an 11-2 run to get back into the game. With Curry, Durant and Draymond Green on the bench, a 3-pointer by little-used Chasson Randle with 7:46 left cut Washington's deficit to two at 108-106, and Sam Dekker missed a lay-in on the next possession that would have tied it. Shaun Livingston hit two free throws the next time down the floor for Golden State, and dunks by Alfonzo McKinnie and Kevon Looney pushed the lead back up to eight. The Warriors pulled away when Curry re-entered the game and haven't lost since Jan. 3. ""Every win in the NBA is tough and it's hard to win in the NBA, so no one's taking it for granted,"" Durant said. ""But we are striving for perfection every night, and I think tonight was a step in the right direction."" TIP-INS Warriors: Curry surpassed 30 points for the 19th time this season. ... Green grabbed a season-high 15 rebounds. ... One game after tying an NBA record by making his first 10 3-point attempts, Klay Thompson was 1 of 4 on 3s. ...

F Otto Porter Jr. came off the bench for the 10th consecutive game, was 0 of 7 on 3-point attempts and finished with seven points. ... Beal shot 1 of 9 on 3s. OBAMA MEETING Even though a photo of the Warriors visiting with former President Barack Obama came out on social media, players and coach Steve Kerr were reluctant to talk about it. Curry said he had no idea where the idea came from, Durant called it amazing and Green called it a ""good private team meeting."" WARRIORS ALL-STARS Curry and Durant were named All-Star starters, but Kerr doesn't expect Golden State to have four representatives this year, namely because Green and Thompson haven't been playing at their recent levels consistently enough to make it. And the Warriors weren't this dominant in previous months. ""I don't think it's been that kind of a season,"" Kerr said. ""It's been rocky at least until the last few weeks.""","401071389"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Thunder coach Billy Donovan has heard questions all season about Russell Westbrook's shaky shooting. He hasn't been concerned because Westbrook does everything else so well. The 2017 MVP posted his NBA-leading 15th triple-double and Oklahoma City beat the injury-depleted New Orleans Pelicans 122-116 on Thursday night. ""He impacts the game in so many different ways,"" Donovan said. ""He can do it through rebounding, he can do it through defense, he can do it through assists, he can do it through getting out in transition. He does a lot of different things to impact the game, so when people talked to me earlier on about his shooting -- I'm really not worried about it."" In this game, Westbrook's shot wasn't so bad, either. He finished with 23 points on 9-of-19 shooting and had 17 rebounds and 16 assists. The Thunder improved to 10-5 this season when he tallies a triple-double. ""He is a once-in-a-generation kind of guy,"" Thunder forward Abdel Nader said. ""He's special. On both ends, he plays with the energy level I think some guys wish they could play with."" Paul George had 23 points and 11 rebounds and Steven Adams added 20 points and 13 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which won its fourth straight. The Pelicans were without star center Anthony Davis, who missed his third straight game with a left index finger sprain, and the team announced Thursday that Nikola Mirotic will be out at least a week with a right calf strain. New Orleans forward Julius Randle sat out with a right ankle sprain and guard E'Twaun Moore rested because of nagging injuries. Jrue Holiday had 22 points and 13 assists, and Darius Miller matched a career high with 21 points for New Orleans. ""I thought we competed as hard as we possibly could and played very unselfishly,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We just didn't have enough firepower to get over the hump."" The revamped lineup presented a challenge for Oklahoma City. ""You've got to learn guys' tendencies on the go, figure out the guys that they are throwing in there, learn the personnel on the fly,"" George said. Oklahoma City led 65-53 at halftime behind 18 points from Adams. Westbrook secured his triple-double early in the third quarter, and the Thunder rolled to a 98-82 lead at the end of the period. The Pelicans rallied, but never got closer than five in the final quarter. ""They just put different and weird lineups out there and they had a little momentum going,"" George said. ""We did what we had to do. We did enough to win tonight."" Gentry felt there were positives to take away from challenging a team the caliber of the Thunder with so many players out. Oklahoma City is in third place in the Western Conference standings. ""It seemed every time we got down, we found a way to get back in the game,"" he said. TIP-INS Pelicans: C Jahlil Okafor scored 18 points in his sixth start of the season. ... G Elfrid Payton had 15 points and 12 assists. ... New Orleans has lost four of five. Thunder: G Alex Abrines sat out his 11th straight game for personal reasons. He was active, but Donovan said Abrines is not ready to play yet. ... George was announced as an All-Star starter on Thursday. ... Mirotic, who averages 16.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game, was injured Wednesday night against Detroit. ... It was the 119th triple-double of Westbrook's career. STAT LINES Westbrook has been especially dynamic during Oklahoma City's win streak.

"PHOENIX --  It took a while, but the Portland Trail Blazers finally did what they were supposed to do with the depleted Phoenix Suns. Damian Lillard scored 24 points, CJ McCollum and Jake Layman added 20 apiece and the Trail Blazers pulled away in the second half to hand the Suns their sixth straight loss, 120-106 on Thursday night. The Trail Blazers beat Phoenix for the ninth straight time. Portland has won four of five and eight of 11 overall. ""First half was frustrating,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We missed a lot of shots at the rim early on. We gave up too many transition points in the first quarter. We played much better in the second half, obviously."" Seth Curry had 17 points and Jusuf Nurkic 16 for Portland. Devin Booker scored 27 for the Suns but only nine after the first quarter. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 on 6-of-18 shooting. Dragan Bender, forced into the starting center role due to injuries, had 17. The Suns were without rookie center Deandre Ayton (sprained left ankle) and backup Richaun Holmes (right foot sprain) for the third straight game. T.J. Warren also sat out with a sore right ankle, and Suns starting point guard De'Anthony Melton left in the third quarter with a sprained right ankle. What was left of the Suns stayed with the Blazers through the first half and much of the second. Booker shot 6 of 9, including 2 of 4 on 3-pointers, in his 18-point first quarter and the Suns led 31-30 after one. With McCollum on the bench with three fouls, Phoenix stretched the lead to 47-41 on Josh Jackson's coast-to-coast drive with 5:52 left in the half. Portland, though, responded with a 12-1 run to go up 54-48 on Lillard's two free throws with 1:17 remaining. Booker sank four free throws, his only points of the second quarter, and the Trail Blazers led 56-52 at the break. Elie Okobo made a pair of 3s in a 14-1 spurt that cut the Blazers' lead to 73-72 with 4:21 left in the third quarter, but Portland finished the period on a 15-4 run. Layman scored twice and Lillard sank three free throws -- one on a technical against Jackson -- as the Blazers scored the last seven points of the quarter to take an 88-76 lead entering the fourth. ""Offense got a little stagnant, stopped moving the ball as much and they just got hot,"" Jackson said. The Blazers opened the final quarter with a 12-4 surge and Phoenix never challenged again. ""I think we missed a lot of shots in the paint in the first half,"" Lillard said. ""We were getting good shots but missing those shots. We turned the ball over. ... I think in the second half we were much sharper, making them throw the ball away. We executed better offensively and that's part of being a good team."" LILLARD VS. BOOKER Suns coach Igor Kokoskov praised the overall play of Lillard. ""He's a very, very good player,"" Kokoskov said. ""So he doesn't have to score 60 points to impact the game."" He was asked if someday Booker's game will be as good. ""I would say in about seven years he's going to be an even better player than Damian,"" Kokoskov said. ""No disrespect to Damian, I love his game. It's a process."" Lillard is 27 years old and a six-year NBA veteran. Booker is 22 in his fourth season.

"LOS ANGELES --  The Minnesota Timberwolves needed three players to step up when guard Derrick Rose went down injured. Andrew Wiggins, Jerryd Bayless and Jared Terrell all delivered in the absence of Rose, who didn't play in the second half because of a sore right ankle, and another dominant performance by Karl-Anthony Towns helped the Timberwolves keep rolling. Towns had 27 points and 12 rebounds to propel Minnesota past the Los Angeles Lakers 120-105 on Thursday night. Wiggins added 23 points and Bayless scored 16 off the bench for the Timberwolves, who have won three straight. Terrell, a rookie guard, had 10 points to help make up for the loss of Rose, who had six points in 12 minutes before exiting. ""It was a huge team win,"" Wiggins said. ""We have a lot of guys out, a lot of guys that (are) hurt, and people came in and stepped up."" Interim coach Ryan Saunders did not know if Rose would be available to play Friday against Utah. It was the frontline of Towns and Taj Gibson that put Minnesota ahead with an 11-1 run early in the third quarter. Towns had seven points, including a 3-pointer to push the Timberwolves back in front 69-66 with 7:34 to play in the period. They did not trail again. Gibson had the other four points and finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Wiggins was effective in closing out the game with nine points and three assists in the fourth quarter. Terrell scored seven in the period after totaling nine in his first four career games. ""Guys banding together all the way, we were great,"" Saunders said. ""All the way down the line we had great efforts."" Rajon Rondo had 15 points, 13 assists and six rebounds in his first game since injuring a finger on his right hand at Golden State on Christmas, but the Lakers lost their third in a row. Brandon Ingram had 20 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 13. Rondo went right to work after missing 14 games because of a sprained finger that required surgery, getting eight points and four rebounds in the first quarter. But Los Angeles centers Ivica Zubac and JaVale McGee had seven of the Lakers' 20 turnovers, which led to 34 points for the Timberwolves. ""It went back to physicality,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""They didn't get turnovers from trying to play-make. They got the ball stripped from them."" SWEET LUOL The Timberwolves also got an unexpected contribution from Luol Deng, who had seven points and three rebounds in 11 minutes after playing in one game for the Lakers last season. Deng was bought out by Los Angeles in September after signing a four-year, $72 million free agent contract in 2016, but said he was not interested in any personal retribution against his former team. ""I tried not to make this me against them,"" Deng said. ""This was really the Timberwolves coming in here and needing a win. I try to clear my mind from all that. What happened, happened. I'm blessed in so many other ways. I just wanted just to focus on winning the game."" LOST KUZ Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma couldn't get on track, finishing with 10 points and failing to make any of his four 3-point attempts. Walton attributed the poor performance to a hip injury. Kuzma said he landed on the hip after making his first shot and hoped that two days of treatment would be enough to allow him to play Sunday against Phoenix. ""We're fighting to be in the playoffs, we're fighting for seeding and the season is ticking down,"" Kuzma said. ""Everything has to be serious right now. Every game matters, every possession, every second."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Jeff Teague missed his second straight game because of soreness in his left foot. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Jeff Green and the Washington Wizards used their 3-point game to beat the Orlando Magic. Green shot 6 for 9 from 3-point range and finished with 24 points as the Wizards defeated the Magic 95-91 Friday night. Green, who made less than 28 percent of his threes in 69 games with the Magic two years ago, finished with a season high in points. ""He had his 3 game going tonight,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""Jeff gave us some opportunities with shooting the 3s, spacing the floor. And if you don't guard him, he's great with the ball."" Green made the go-ahead layup with 42 seconds left in a matchup of teams trying to get into playoff position midway through the season. Bradley Beal had 27 points and seven assists for the Wizards, who won for the fifth time in seven games. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 28 points and nine rebounds, and Aaron Gordon added 22 points and 11 rebounds. But the Magic shot a dreadful 7 for 33 (21 percent) from beyond the arc.

""We were losing. We had to do something and we wanted to come in and make a spark,"" Pinson said. Pinson, on a two-way contract, scored a career-high 19 points. Davis tied season highs with 17 points and 16 rebounds, and Napier added 18 points as the Nets' reserves turned around the game even without Dinwiddie, their sixth man who has torn ligaments in his right thumb.

The Nets wrapped up the season series with the 19th victory in their last 24 games, a sizzling stretch that has brought hopes of playoff basketball to New York after both of the city's teams missed the postseason the last three years. The Nets are 27-23, their best 50-game record since going 29-21 in 2012-13, their first season since moving from New Jersey and making their home just a few miles from the Knicks. They won only 28 games all last season. But they filled in some holes over the summer with players such as Davis and Napier, who have helped them overcome injuries, first to Caris LeVert and now Dinwiddie, who will need surgery at some point but so far was only ruled out for Friday's game. It was tied at 60 at halftime, with the Nets getting 42 of their points from the bench to erase an 11-point deficit. ""Guys are ready,"" Davis said. ""Theo showed that tonight.

The Heat easily defeated the Cavaliers in the teams' first two meetings, 118-94 in Miami on Dec. 28, and 117-92 in Cleveland on Jan. 2. The first half featured six lead changes and the score was tied six times. Cleveland led 53-48 at halftime, before Miami took over. Burks and Sexton each scored 13 for Cleveland. TIP-INS Heat: G Dion Waiters (migraine) was unavailable. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2012 draft spent his first three NBA seasons with Cleveland. . F Kelly Olynyk (four minutes) and G Rodney McGruder (10 minutes) saw action after falling out of the rotation earlier this week. Both failed to score. Cavaliers: Cleveland is 5-19 at home. ... G Cameron Payne, who didn't play Friday, will complete his second 10-day contract Saturday, meaning Cleveland must either sign him for the rest of the season or let him go. LAST TIME AROUND Wade is to retire after the season. The Cavaliers showed a video tribute during the game's first timeout for the future Hall of Famer, who waved to the fans while getting a loud ovation. Wade played in 46 games with the Cavaliers last season. He was traded to Miami in February. ""It was great,"" Wade said. ""In four months here, I got a chance to get out into the community and get to know some of the fans, so it was nice. I appreciate it."" Wade exchanged jerseys with Sexton following the game. ""It means a whole lot,"" Sexton said. ""Everything he did for this game and him being someone I can talk to is pretty cool."" INJURY UPDATE Drew hopes All-Star Kevin Love, who has played in only four games because of a foot injury, will return soon. Drew was impressed with Love's work during offensive drills in Friday's shoot-around. Drew said Love still hasn't gone through any contact drills and no timetable has been established for his return. Forward Tristan Thompson will miss about two more weeks because of a sprained left foot. He's been sidelined for five games. Forward Larry Nance Jr. returned after missing eight games with a sprained right knee and had six points in 21 minutes. TOUGH TIMES Drew became head coach when Tyronn Lue was fired Oct. 28, after an 0-6 start. Drew's contract includes a team option for the 2019-20 season. He'll receive a buyout payment if the Cavaliers choose not to retain him. ""We know all the challenges we've had thus far,"" Drew said. ""We certainly know there will possibly be more challenges ahead, but we'll continue to try to keep this team very competitive, keep this team playing hard (and) keep developing our young guys.""","401071395"
"CHICAGO --  In his 14th season, Lou Williams put up a stat line he won't forget. The reserve guard had 31 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Chicago Bulls 106-101 on Friday night. ""It's special. This is my first career triple double. This one I'll celebrate. It's cool,"" Williams said. ""Rebounding's not necessarily my thing. I never bank on getting triple-doubles. I give up most of my rebounds away to the big guys. I let the ball bounce so they can get it. ""I just play. The only person that mentioned something to me was Boban (Marjanovic) with five minutes left in the fourth quarter. I was like, `I appreciate it, Boban, but you're going to mess with my psyche.' It was cool to get it. It was fun."" With the Bulls leading 97-96, Patrick Beverley blocked 7-footer Lauri Markkanen's shot in the paint, which led to a four-point play by Williams to give the Clippers a 100-97 lead. Zach LaVine cut the Clippers' lead to 100-99 with 1:26 left, but Beverley was there again for the Clippers with a runner in the lane to extend the lead 102-99 with 37.8 seconds remaining. ""We were a little late on the rotation, we didn't want Williams or (Tobias) Harris to beat us and we let Beverley to be the guy that beat us and he made the play,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. After a LaVine air-balled from 3-point range, Williams hooked up with Montrezl Harrell for an alley-oop dunk to close out the game as Los Angeles finished a cross-country trip with three wins in four games. Lavine scored 29 points and Bobby Portis added 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Bulls, who have lost 12 of their last 13. Dunn, who fouled Williams' on the four-point play, is trying not to let the losses pile up in his head. ""I stay positive. I know what we're going through. It's adversity. It definitely hit this team. It shows your true character when adversity hits,"" Dunn said. The Clippers cut into the Bulls' 12-point lead in the third behind Williams' 12 points in the quarter. The Clippers trailed 82-80 going into the fourth. Chicago extended the lead to 87-82 on LaVine's three-point play, but the Clippers answered with a 7-0 run. Johnathan Motley capped off the run with a dunk to give the Clippers a 89-87 lead with 8:38 left in the game. Jabari Parker, who has played limited minutes since being pushed out of the regular rotation by Bulls coach Jim Boylen in mid-December, came off the bench to score 12 points in the first half on 5-of-7 shooting. LaVine led the Bulls with 14 points and rookie Chandler Hutchison added 12 points and five rebounds. The Clippers, who had difficulties arriving from the team hotel to the United Center, trailed 56-52 at the half.  Harris led Los Angles with 15 points Parker signed a two-year deal with the Bulls in the offseason for $20 million a season, next season is a club option and doesn't appear he is in Chicago's future plans. The Clippers, who had difficulties arriving from the team hotel to the United Center, trailed 56-52 at the half. CHICAGO TRAFFIC ISSUES The Clippers took three buses to the United Center with the second two arriving inside an hour before tip-off. The last bus carrying coach Doc Rivers, Avery Bradley and Williams arrived 45 minutes before tip. The second bus took 1 hour, 45 minutes to arrive due to snowy and freezing conditions in Chicago. The bus trip from the downtown hotel to the United Center typically takes around 20 minutes. Rivers said his teams wasn't fazed by the abbreviated warm-ups. ""I thought we played great at the beginning. Heck, all of these guys have played AAU. It was typical AAU: You show up and play. We didn't have time to do film, we didn't have time to do anything because we were so late and that's on us. We got the traffic wrong today. I should know better,"" said Rivers, who grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago. Beverley, a Chicago native, wished the bus driver followed his directions. ""I told him to go down Jackson, but he didn't listen."" RARE COMPANY The only other player in NBA history with a 30-point triple double off the bench, was Detlef Schrempf. He did it Feb. 13, 1993, with the Pacers vs. Milwaukee: 34 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists. TIP-INS Not only did the Clippers have a tough time arriving to the United Center, the Bulls fans did, too. The United Center appeared to be only half-filled at tip. Bulls (19,978) are second only to Philadelphia in home attendance this season.","401071396"
"HOUSTON --  In a season filled with lots of injuries that have resulted in just as many ups and downs, the Houston Rockets have found help in unlikely places. When Chris Paul was injured, they got a boost by signing Austin Rivers following his release by the Suns. And after the recent injury to Clint Capela, Houston scooped up Kenneth Faried after he was released by the Nets. After just three games, Faried is proving another great fit as he scored 21 points and had a season-high 14 rebounds Friday night to help the Rockets to a 121-119 win over the Toronto Raptors. ""The lift was great,"" James Harden said. ""Kenneth brought the energy that we've been waiting on."" Harden scored 35 points for his 22nd straight game with 30 or more and the Rockets never trailed and held off a late charge in the victory. After averaging 52.2 points over the last five games, capped by a franchise-record 61 in Wednesday's win over the Knicks, Harden's torrid scoring pace slowed a bit as all of Houston's starters scored 10 points or more. Eric Gordon led that group with 24, P.J. Tucker added 18 and Austin Rivers scored 13. Houston led by 11 points after two free throws by Harden with 1:14 remaining before the Raptors made three straight 3-pointers to cut the lead to 121-119 with 27.3 remaining. Gordon missed a 3 to give the Raptors a chance, but Kawhi Leonard's 3-point attempt was short as he was defended by Harden. Tucker, who is Houston's leader on defense, was asked about Harden's defense on the last play. ""He plays defense when he wants to,"" Tucker said with a laugh. ""Everybody talks about him playing defense but ... since I've been here he's stepped up (after) everybody called him out."" It's the 22nd straight game in which Harden has led his team and Houston's opponent in scoring, which moves him past Michael Jordan for the second-longest streak in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain, who did it in 40 in a row. Danny Green, who led Toronto's effort to slow Harden down thought they did a ""decent job"" on him. ""We wanted the other guys to beat us and they did, and they did well,"" he said. ""They shot well and Eric Gordon, P.J. Tucker and Faried, we made those guys look really good tonight. We have to do a better job of ... doing both -- stopping one guy and limiting the other guys from getting into rhythm as well."" Harden's stretch of 30-point games is the fourth-longest in league history, behind three streaks by Chamberlain of 25, 31 and 65 games. Harden was 15 of 15 on free throws, but struggled from long-range, shooting just 2 of 13 on 3-point attempts. The strong play of Faried gave Harden some much-needed help Friday and The Beard will get another reinforcement Sunday night when Paul is expected to return after missing 17 games with a strained left hamstring. ""I love playing basketball, so for me just to be out there with those guys helping out any way I can, rebounding, defense, blocks, just being out there giving my all,"" a beaming Faried said. The Raptors got 32 points from Leonard as they dropped their second straight. The Rockets held a 7-point lead to start the fourth and pushed it to 10 before the Raptors scored five straight points, capped by a 3 from Norman Powell to get within 99-94 with about nine minutes left. Houston then used a 9-0 run to extend the lead to 108-94 about three minutes later. Rivers made a 3 late in that span before Tucker capped it by grabbing a steal and finishing with a layup. Toronto got within 10 after scoring four quick points later in the fourth, but a layup by Harden made it 117-105 with about 90 seconds left. Houston led by as many as 22 early, but Toronto used a 41-point second quarter to cut the lead to 70-61 at halftime. The Raptors opened the third quarter with a 9-4 run to get within 4, but Houston followed with an 18-4 spurt, with nine points each from Harden, to push it to 92-74 with about four minutes left in the quarter. The Raptors got back on track after that, scoring the next 10 points, with two 3-pointers from Green, to cut the lead to 92-84 with about a minute left in the third. TIP-INS Raptors: Jonas Valanciunas missed his 21st game with a dislocated left thumb. ... Green and Pascal Siakam added 22 points each. ... Serge Ibaka had 12 points and 14 rebounds. Rockets: Brandon Knight missed his seventh straight game with a sore left knee, but is expected to return Sunday. ... Houston made its first 20 free throws on Friday night before a miss by Faried with 7:55 left in the fourth quarter. The Rockets finished 29 of 33 from the line. THEY SAID IT Faried, who holds the NCAA record for most career rebounds with 1,673, on his big rebounding night: ""It just made me feel like myself again.""","401071397"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Sacramento Kings made the right plays down the stretch to end their losing streak and extend the Memphis Grizzlies' miseries. Buddy Hield scored 26 points and De'Aaron Fox added 22, including a key 19-footer in the final minute, to help the Kings to a 99-96 victory over the Grizzlies on Friday night. The loss was Memphis' eighth straight and 14th in the last 15 games as the team tries to hold itself together amid trade rumors involving star Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. For Sacramento, the win was a welcome relief after a two-game slide. The Kings climbed above .500 (25-24) and -- while they are in 10th in the Western Conference -- they remain only two games behind the sixth-place team. Fox provided the cushion to help the Kings down a weird stretch in the closing seconds. A layup by Memphis guard Shelvin Mack cut the Kings' lead to 96-94 with 32.8 seconds left. But on the ensuing possession, Fox broke loose and hit the step-back jumper near the top of the key that gave Sacramento a 98-94 advantage. ""De'Aaron made a heck of a shot there to put us up four, which was terrific. But we battled,"" said Kings coach Dave Joerger, who characterized the game as ""a crazy win."" Fox added: ""I just made a tough shot. That's all it was."" But there was still some craziness left after Fox's jumper. The Grizzlies had a chance in the closing seconds to overtake the Kings, but had a call go against them. With 4.3 seconds left, Memphis appeared to trap Hield along the sideline in the backcourt when whistles blew. One official called a jump ball and another called a foul on Mack. After the crew got together, the foul was upheld, and Hield hit one of the two ensuing free throws for the final margin. ""I don't understand how that works to be honest with you,"" said a dejected J.B. Bickerstaff, the Memphis coach. ""The referee that was on the call, called a jump ball, and then he was overruled by another official. . It was clear to everybody in the arena that he called a jump ball."" Nemanja Bjelica finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Kings. Omri Casspi led the Grizzlies with 18 points, while Conley added 16 points and nine assists. JaMychal Green finished with 14 points for the Grizzlies, who have won only one game since the day after Christmas. ""We lost. That's pretty much it,"" Memphis rookie forward Jaren Jackson Jr. said after scoring 11 points. TIP-INS Kings: Fox had a steal in the fourth quarter, his 18th straight game recording a steal. He entered the game averaging 1.77 steals, seventh-best in the league. ... Rookie Marvin Bagley III, who started the first game of his career when the Kings played Toronto earlier this week, returned to his reserve role. He finished with 14 points. .. .Hield, who was 6 of 9 from outside the arc, made three straight 3-pointers spanning the third and fourth quarters. Grizzlies: F Bruno Caboclo, who signed to a 10-day contract on Thursday, made his first appearance in the third quarter. He played 8 minutes, but did not score. .Reserve C Joakim Noel returned to the roster after missing the previous three games for ""personal reasons."" . F Garrett Temple left the floor late in the first quarter with a left shoulder injury. He did not return. ""X-rays were negative,"" Bickerstaff said. ""He's going to get an MRI (Saturday), and we'll see from there."" MUST-WIN With a two-game slide, it was important for the Kings to get back on track before facing the Clippers in Los Angeles on Sunday to close out a six-game trip. The Clippers are one of the teams ahead of Sacramento in the standings. And Fox noted Hield's contribution to breaking the losing streak. ""With us trying to stay in the playoff race, we definitely need games like that,"" the Kings guard said. ""When we play well, we live with the results.""","401071398"
"DALLAS --  Rookie sensation Luka Doncic's reputation as a scorer keeps growing. So does Maxi Kleber's penchant for blocking shots. Doncic scored 32 points, Kleber hit a crucial 3-pointer after blocking a shot by Blake Griffin and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Detroit Pistons 106-101 on Friday night. Griffin scored 35 for his eighth 30-point game in the past 11, but couldn't get a key bucket when trying to back down Kleber. After Griffin's attempt to save the ball inbounds was collected by Doncic, the 19-year-old found Kleber alone at the 3-point line. Initially, Kleber's fourth 3 gave Dallas a 100-97 lead, but the score changed to 100-95 on the subsequent timeout. The Pistons lost two points when Andre Drummond's basket more than two minutes earlier was overturned on review by a shot-clock violation. ""That was a tough one,"" Drummond said. ""They waited so long to take it away too and it got down to pretty much the three-minute mark before they finally got a chance to look at it. We can't control things like that."" Dallas got its 18th win in 24 home games in the first of two games between teams with matching 21-26 records. ""The game was won at the defensive end, which was great to see,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It was a game we have to have as we try to claw our way back into the playoff picture."" Detroit had a chance to tie when Stanley Johnson missed a 3-pointer, and DeAndre Jordan dunked over fellow 6-foot-11 center Drummond for the second time, this one on an assist from Doncic, who had eight rebounds and eight assists. Kleber's fourth and final block came on a dunk attempt by Drummond, and Doncic hit a fadeaway jumper for his fifth 30-point game and a 104-97 lead with 1:18 remaining. A second-year player from Germany, Kleber took over the team lead for blocks with 55. The 26-year-old has two more than Jordan, who was one of the league's top shot-blockers earlier in his career. Thanks to Kleber's earlier work, it didn't matter as much when Griffin soared over him for a spectacular dunk in the final minute. ""I always try to see where the guy's taking off and then I judge, `Can he dunk it or not?"" said Kleber, who had 12 points. ""I didn't want to make the foul because I had five already, so I kind of twist to the side. I was like, `No, he's not going to make that.' Well, he dunked that."" Drummond, who returned after missing three games while in the concussion protocol, got the better of Jordan in the battle of the NBA's top two rebounders and two of the league leaders in double-doubles, but Jordan made the clutch plays late. Detroit's big man had 23 points and 15 rebounds for his 37th double-double, while Jordan scored 13 points with 11 boards for his 30th double-double. TIP-INS Pistons: Griffin scored 15 straight points in the second quarter before a put-back dunk by Drummond. ... Jackson was the other double-figure scorer with 12 points on 4-of-14 shooting and had nine assists. Mavericks: Kleber made his first three 3s in the first half and finished 4 of 7 from long range. ... The Mavericks were more accurate on 3-pointers than free throws in the first half, going 9 of 20 from long range (45 percent) and 5 of 13 from the line (39 percent). ... Dirk Nowitzki, in his record 21st season with just one franchise, didn't score in 10 minutes. CLOSING TROUBLE AGAIN Griffin criticized his team's decision-making late in games after a win in New Orleans because the Pistons almost blew a comfortable lead. This time, they took too long to get off a shot after Griffin's highlight-reel dunk and a miss from Doncic at the other end. Reggie Jackson missed a 3 with less than five seconds remaining, securing the Dallas win. SMITH SOLID AGAIN Dennis Smith Jr., in his second game back with Dallas after a week away from the team amid trade talk, scored 11 of his 19 points in the first quarter. He and Doncic combined to go 17 of 33 from the field after making just 11 of 32 in Smith's first game back, a win over the Clippers. ""He's back. We've got two wins,"" Doncic said of his 21-year-old backcourt mate. ""He brings a lot. He's aggressive. He's fast. He helps us a lot.""","401071399"
"MILWAUKEE --  Seldom-used Pat Connaughton and a defensive switch sparked the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks. And Connaughton didn't even score. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 14 rebounds and Milwaukee rallied to beat Charlotte 108-99 on Friday night, outscoring the Hornets 32-12 in the fourth quarter. Malcolm Brogdon added 19 points, Eric Bledsoe had 18, and Khris Middleton 15 to help the Bucks improve to 35-12 with their sixth straight victory. They are 22-4 at home. ""Once we switched up our coverages and made them play a lot of 1-on-1, it changed the game for us,"" Bledsoe said. ""We were taking the ball out (of the net) all game, up until the end. We started to get stops, get out and get transition shots, drive and kick. We did a great job."" Down 92-80 with 9:45 left, the Bucks fought back with an 11-0 run. They finally took the lead on Brogdon's drive with 5:34 left. After Walker scored, Antetokounmpo did a huge spin and dunked with one hand to put the Bucks up 97-96. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer inserted Connaughton in the final minute of the third quarter, with the Bucks looking ragged. Connaughton's energetic defense helped energize Milwaukee, and he remained in the game until the final 25 seconds. ""I've always prided myself on trying to make winning plays, whatever that may be,"" Connaughton said. ""For professional athletes, that's our job to be ready. This team is unique. We have guys one through 15 who have made an impact on the season at some point."" Connaughton had not played in six of the previous nine games. ""It's just mostly gut,"" Budenholzer said. ""We were in a little bit of mud. Just see if we could find a spark. I don't think he made a basket but he had as big an impact on the game as anybody. The crowd's energy and Pat's energy really lifted us up in the fourth quarter."" Charlotte star Kemba Walker was injured in a scrum with 2:06 left when Antetokounmpo landed him. Walker headed directly to the locker room. Nicolas Batum led the Hornets with 19 points, Jeremy Lamb and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each had 16, and Walker had 10 on 3-of-12 shooting. ""We played well for 42 minutes,"" Batum said. ""This is the best team in the East, maybe one of the top two teams in the NBA right now. They've got one MVP candidate, they've got a great coach and they play well, especially at home. It's been three games and we've played those guys, we've had a chance to win every time. We moved the ball really well. But they did a good job the last 6 minutes, being more aggressive on defense and they scored in transition every time."" TIP-INS Hornets: Tony Parker sat out to rest. The former San Antonio star scored 17 points in 17 minutes off the bench in the Hornets' 118-107 victory at Memphis on Wednesday night. ""What he's done in fourth quarters, you talk about experience, you talk about basketball IQ and knowledge and winning plays,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He's got a whole data base of what it takes to win games, and he can dial it up in those moments."" ... Walker collided with Antetokounmpo in a scramble for a loose ball late in the game and suffered what the team termed a mild neck sprain. Walker went to the locker room and did not return in the final 2 minutes. Bucks: Rookie guard Donte DiVincenzo was inactive because if a left heel injury. He left the arena in a walking boot after the game. ""We may just need to give him an extended period of rest or non-activity and be exceedingly cautious,"" Budenholzer said. ""Part of it is Donte wants to play so bad and he's such a hard worker. Sometimes when you're coming back from some of these injuries it can actually work against you. You just need to give it some time."" The Bucks have plenty of backcourt options off the bench with Sterling Brown, George Hill and Tony Snell in the current rotation.","401071400"
"DENVER --  When the NBA handed down Nikola Jokic's one-game suspension Friday afternoon, Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone called for two things: an explanation from the league and a second shootaround from his players. He appreciated the first and was satisfied with the second after the Nuggets rallied around their star center's absence in routing the Phoenix Suns 132-95 on Friday night. ""The league was great, and I mean this,"" Malone said, adding the NBA apologized for not informing him of Jokic's suspension before the Nuggets' noon shootaround. ""They were just busting my chops in there because we brought them back in the afternoon just to walk through the plays once we knew who was in, who was out,"" Malone said after emerging from his victorious locker room. ""But, whatever it takes for a win."" Mason Plumlee laughed about the extra pre-game practice. ""I don't think anyone was happy"" about it, he said. ""Did we need it? I don't know. He can say it was the right move now because we played well."" Paul Millsap had 20 points to lead eight Nuggets in double figures, and Denver held the Suns to 40 second-half points in handing Phoenix is seventh straight loss. Jokic, the Nuggets' leader in points, rebounds and assists, was banished for a night by the NBA for leaving the bench during an altercation in Utah two nights earlier. Although the suspension forced him to juggle his lineup and rotations, Malone said it didn't ""change our focus at all because that should not change no matter who's playing in uniform. Obviously, when you are down your best player and an All-Star, other guys have to step up."" That, they did. Plumlee got the start in Jokic's absence and had 16 points, six assists and seven rebounds in 25 minutes. ""People forget, Mason Plumlee was a starter on a playoff team"" in Portland, Malone said. ""So, as much as we love Nikola, with Nikola not being here tonight, Mase is more than capable of taking those minutes and playing like Nikola."" All five starters reached double digits and so did reserves Malik Beasley (19 points), Monte Morris (17) and Trey Lyles (12). ""That's what good teams do,"" Malone said. ""When somebody's not here, somebody else steps up."" Jokic's absence sure didn't turn into a blessing for Phoenix. ""They didn't need him the way they played -- or the way we played,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. Devin Booker led the Suns with 35 points. They were without their own big man with DeAndre Ayton missing the game with a sprained left ankle. ""We know we didn't play well tonight,"" Booker said. ""It was kind of embarrassing."" VANDERBILT DEBUT Nuggets rookie Jarred Vanderbilt, a 19-year-old selected in the second round of the NBA draft out of Kentucky, made his pro debut in the waning minutes after recovering from ankle and foot injuries. ""I'm happy he got that first-game jitters out of the way,"" said Malone, who wants Vanderbilt to get his legs under him in the G-League. In 3 minutes, Vanderbilt had a point, an assist on a full-court pass, a steal and three rebounds, then was doused by a couple of teammates with two cups of Gatorade. ""He's in the league now,"" Plumlee said. LIGHT WORK Jamal Murray scored 13 points but rolled his troublesome ankle again. Malone said with the big lead, there was no reason to put him back in. ""That was the good thing about tonight as well: our starters, nobody played crazy minutes,"" Malone said. ""We were able to play a lot of guys with tomorrow being our third game in four nights, that's always important.""

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell was finding his teammates in all sorts of ways. One of his career-high 11 assists looked as if it belonged on the diamond instead of the court. ""I got back to my old ways,"" said Mitchell, who pitched and played shortstop in high school. ""It was just making a play, making a read and Georges (Niang) was wide open and a two-hand pass just wouldn't have worked."" Mitchell scored 24 points but the Utah Jazz frittered away a 23-point lead and barely outlasted the short-handed Minnesota Timberwolves 106-102 on Friday night. ""I don't think we were happy with the game ended and we weren't happy with the way we played in the fourth,"" Mitchell said. ""We got complacent in ways."" Rudy Gobert, who was a game-time decision with a sore hamstring, had 18 points and 16 rebounds, and Kyle Korver scored 16 for the Jazz, who have won eight of their last nine. Karl-Anthony Towns had 33 points and 10 rebounds and Andrew Wiggins scored 21 points on 8-of-26 shooting and had a season-high 11 rebounds for Minnesota, which saw its three-game winning streak snapped on the second game of a back-to-back. ""Fourth quarter, I'm trying to take over the game and dominate,"" Towns said. ""I'm trying to give us a chance to win. I was just being a little aggressive all around and trying to make plays everywhere."" Anthony Tolliver hit his second 3 of the final four minutes to get the Timberwolves within one at 103-102, but Luol Deng missed an open 3-pointer in the corner for a chance to give Minnesota its first lead since the first quarter. Joe Ingles, who had 12 points, snatched the rebound and hit two free throws. On the next possession, Gobert got a piece of Tolliver's 3-point attempt. Mitchell rebounded and hit one free throw to clinch the win. ""I had to make a play and block that shot,"" said Gobert, who had four blocks. ""We had to lock in."" Mitchell, who has scored at least 24 points in 11 consecutive games, was forced to play the point for six games while all three Jazz point guards were injured. Even though Rubio has returned, Mitchell has continued his playmaking ways and marked the first double-double of his career. ""I'm just making good reads and having confidence in my passes,"" Mitchell said. ""When we had three point guards out, you got to be able to make those plays, that's where it started. I had no choice."" In the second quarter, Mitchell -- the son of former minor league pitcher Donovan Sr., the New York Mets' director of player relations -- threw the surprising cross-court fastball with one hand to Niang for a 3. ""At this time last year, he wasn't even throwing those passes to the corner and now he's throwing left hand, right hand, one, two, whatever he needs to do to get it there,"" Ingles said. In the third quarter, the Timberwolves took another hit when Taj Gibson went after the officials and got two technicals and had to be restrained by his teammates after a foul call as Ingles went to the basket. The Jazz then shot five free throws, three by Mitchell (as Towns also got a technical) and two by Ingles. With 4:46 left in the third, Mitchell hit two more foul shots to cap the 13-0 run and the Jazz led 75-54. The Jazz led by as many as 23 in the third period, but the Timberwolves scored the first 13 points of the fourth quarter. When Towns followed his own missed jumper with a layup, the Timberwolves had closed within eight at 90-82. Utah barely survived while shooting 5 of 28 in the fourth quarter and was saved by some hustle plays and defensive stops. The Jazz made only two field goals in the final five minutes. ""We lost focus,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Just a lot of mental mistakes."" The Timberwolves were missing Derrick Rose (sore ankle), Tyus Jones (ankle sprain) and Jeff Teague (sore foot), which caused some trouble in executing the offense and players getting the ball in unfamiliar positions. GIBSON: `I JUST LOST IT' Gibson doesn't have a problem with official James Williams, even though it looked as though he wanted to fight him when he got ejected. ""I know James,"" Gibson said. ""He's a like big brother. ... You get used to seeing him all the time, so you've got a relationship. Sometimes, tempers flare and kind of lose it a little. But at the end of the day, you know he means well. It's part of the job. It was just one of those times I lost it."" Gibson, who scored his 7,000th career point before his meltdown, continued: ""Like I said, I'm human. But I got a lot of respect for James. Like I said, he's been reffing my games 10-plus years in the NBA. It's up to me just to go talk to him and apologize."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota fumbled its way to 12 turnovers in the first half. ... Towns was limited to six first-half minutes because of foul trouble. ... The Timberwolves outscored the Jazz in the paint 48-38. Jazz: Ingles got a technical in the fourth quarter. ... A bat flew around the arena, interrupting some of the players' pregame shooting routines. The Jazz Bear mascot finally caught the bat. ""That was scary,"" Mitchell said. ""I was not cool with that at all. I'm glad the Bear got him because I would not have finished my warmup. I would have gone to locker room if he was still flying around out there."" ...

"NEW ORLEANS --  With a sore left wrist taking away half his offensive game, LaMarcus Aldridge could have been another injured player sitting out. After testing his wrist in warmups, he decided to play and had a team-high 28 points and 12 rebounds to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a 126-114 victory over the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday. ""I wanted to play,"" Aldridge said after getting his 15th double-double of the season. ""We've been up and down -- more down -- lately, so I just wanted to play and give us a better chance to win."" pleading with coach Gregg Popovich to let him play, especially with San Antonio's leading scorer, DeMar De Rozan sidelined with a sore knee. Popovich said he wanted to rest Aldridge because of the injury he sustained in a 122-120 loss at Philadelphia on Wednesday night, but Aldridge insisted on playing. ""He showed a lot of heart,"" Popovich said. ""He took one for the team tonight."" Rudy Gay had 22 points, including 11 in the third quarter, and 11 rebounds to help San Antonio snap a two-game skid. Aldridge had 12 points during a decisive spurt in the third quarter as the Spurs used a 25-12 run to extend a three-point halftime lead to 85-69. The Spurs shot 55 percent from the field in the period and outscored the Pelicans 36-28. New Orleans played without four key injured contributors -- Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, Nikola Mirotic and E'Twaun Moore -- but the Spurs also had to overcome the absence of leading scorer DeMar DeRozan. The Spurs took advantage of the depleted Pelicans, finishing with a 51-41 advantage in rebounding. ""We're not feeling sorry for ourselves, but obviously, we're outmanned,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""But I thought the guys tried to do everything they could. We hung in and hung in and eventually the rebounding part is going to hurt you."" Aldridge showed few signs of the injury hurting his overall shooting performance, going 12 of 20 from the field, but he said he knew he was limited. ""I couldn't shoot with my left (hand),"" Aldridge said. ""Obviously, I took the one shot left and (Jahlil Okafor) blocked it easy. After that, I learned really quickly I couldn't shoot with my left, so everything was all right."" When the Spurs pushed their lead to 21 points in the fourth quarter, Aldridge was able sit and ice his wrist on the bench. ""To see what (Aldridge) goes through day in and day out, being tested on both ends of the floor every single game and being a big leader for us -- I didn't know he was going to be able to play today,"" Spurs forward Quincy Pondexter said. ""I saw him taping up and getting warmed up and he just told me he wanted to go out there and help us."" Jrue Holiday had a game-high 29 points to lead the Pelicans, and Jahlil Okafor added 24 points and 15 rebounds. The Pelicans, who lost their third straight game, battled hard. Okafor went up against Aldridge, scoring 15 points on 7-of-9 shooting and grabbing nine rebounds in the first half. Aldridge led the Spurs with 16 first-half points on 7-of-13 shooting as San Antonio took a 60-57 lead at the half. TIP-INS Spurs: DeRozan (21.5 ppg) was sidelined with a sore left knee, and coach Gregg Popovich said the rest may be beneficial because DeRozan is suffering from an assortment of ""bumps and bruises."" ... The Spurs improved to 10-15 on the road. Pelicans: Saturday was the anniversary of the Achilles injury that ended the season of former Pelicans C DeMarcus Cousins and eventually saw him sign with Golden State. ...  F Julius Randle sat out with a sprained right ankle. ... Gentry said his team, which ranked 13th in the Western Conference, will not have ""a pity party"" because of injuries to Davis (sprained left index finger) and Mirotic (sprained right calf).

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Staring at an eight-game losing streak and a week of distraction from trade rumblings, the Memphis Grizzlies brought things back to simplicity. And the approach was successful for the struggling squad. Mike Conley had 22 points and 11 assists, Jaren Jackson Jr. added 20 points and Memphis beat the Indiana Pacers 106-103 Saturday night bringing brief relief to the Grizzlies troubles that stretch back to late December. ""I thought everybody just put everything aside tonight,"" Conley said of the change in mindset. ""We said before the game: `Just go out there and play basketball. It's just basketball.' And that's what we did."" The win was only the second for Memphis in the last 16 games after defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers on the day after Christmas. While Memphis has injury issues to add to its miseries, the Pacers have a major one to address. Indiana was playing its first game since a season-ending injury to Victory Oladipo. Oladipo ruptured the quad tendon in his right knee in Wednesday night's victory over Toronto, leaving the Pacers without their leading scorer at 18.8 points a game. ""It was a lot of emotions,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Whenever you lose a guy to an injury such as that -- a season-ending injury -- a lot of emotions are involved. But what you have to do, which is part of the game, you have to move on."" Forward Thaddeus Young added: ""We're just trying, as a team, to find ourselves without Victor Oladipo. That's one of the biggest things. Our offense was a little stagnant as opposed to having Victor out there."" Bojan Bogdanovic scored 21 points to lead the Pacers, who saw their three-game winning streak end. Darren Collison had 18 points and nine assists, while Myles Turner scored 14 points McMillan pointed to a slow start when the Pacers made only two of their first 10 shots as a major issue. That allowed Memphis to take a lead it never relinquished in the game. But the way Memphis closed the third quarter also had a bad effect. Indiana had come back from 11 down in the third to tie the score at 67. However, the Grizzlies answered the rally with their own to carry a 78-69 lead into the fourth. ""We punched back, and we were able to find the theme that made us able to hit the punch again,"" said Marc Gasol, who added 18 points for Memphis. In the closing minutes of the fourth, both teams were accurate from outside the arc -- Memphis converting four in the period to build the lead to 14, and Indiana making five close the deficit at the end. TIP-INS Pacers: Tyreke Evans started in the injured Oladipo's place and finished with nine points. G Aaron Holiday moved into the reserve guard position vacated by Evans moving to the starting role. ... Bogdanovic was 6 of 14 from the field. ... Turner blocked two shots. Grizzlies: Starting F Garrett Temple is out 1-2 weeks after injuring his shoulder late in the first quarter of Friday night's loss to Sacramento. An examination of the injury revealed a mild sprain. ... F Omri Casspi, who filled in after Temple's injury and led the team in scoring against the Kings, also sat out Saturday with right knee soreness. That left rookie G Jevon Carter to get the first start of his career. ... Bruno Caboclo, playing his second game on a 10-day contract, added 11 points, including converting 3 of 4 from outside the arc. THE FEELING OF WINNING There was certainly a different atmosphere in the Grizzlies' locker room, from a smiling Gasol to a much happier Jackson. ""It's definitely something that you can't take for granted,"" Conley said. ""You forget what it feels like. When you start losing, everything is bad. Your body starts to hurt and everything is negative. When you're winning, you walk out the arena feeling good, you can go home and be happy around your family and things like that."" JERSEY SWAP After the game, Grizzlies reserve C Joakim Noah was seen entering the Pacers locker room, but not with ill intentions. Noah was looking for former teammate Kyle O'Quinn. Seems that Noah was fulfilling a request by O'Quinn for a game-worn jersey. Noah did give the Pacers' center some grief for putting ""that dirty, sweaty jersey"" in his travel bag.","401071404"
"BOSTON --  After beating the Lakers without LeBron James and the Wizards without John Wall, the Golden State Warriors were eager to test themselves against a full-strength opponent. The Boston Celtics were just what they were looking for. Kevin Durant had 33 points and nine rebounds, Stephen Curry scored 24 points and Klay Thompson had 21, including two key free throws, for Golden State on Saturday night to beat Boston 115-111 and give the Warriors their 10th win in a row. ""We needed this game,"" said Steve Kerr, who became the fastest coach in NBA history to 300 victories. ""We needed to be challenged and we were challenged big-time and it could have gone either way."" Kyrie Irving scored 32 points with 10 assists and Al Horford had 22 points and 13 rebounds for Boston, which had won five straight and 10 in a row at home. In a game that featured 21 lead changes, the Warriors went ahead 113-111 with 47 seconds left on Thompson's only free throws of the game and held on as Boston had three chances to tie it or take the lead. Marcus Smart rimmed out on a 3-pointer, Irving airballed a fadeaway from the baseline and Marcus Morris was short on a 3. Draymond Green missed two free throws, but he got his own rebound and then Curry made a pair of foul shots with 6.2 seconds left to ice it. ""I guess it's just good for us to come in here and grind out a `W,"" Durant said. ""We'll forget about it in the morning, but for tonight everybody felt good coming in here, knowing we haven't played with this type of intensity in a long time, especially on the road. It was good to feel that. We know that this is different than any other type game, especially with what this team is building."" The matchup of the two-time defending NBA champions and one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference had a sold-out TD Garden standing for the final two minutes. The crowd included several New England Patriots on the eve of their departure for the Super Bowl, including owner Bob Kraft and twin defensive backs Jason and Devin McCourty. ""Two great teams going at it,"" Curry said. ""We bring the best out of each other."" HOT HAND Curry was scoreless in the first quarter, but hit five 3-pointers in five minutes in the second to help Golden State open a 56-47 lead. The Celtics scored the next 10 points to erase it. Asked about Curry not being ""too active"" the rest of the game, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said: ""The second-quarter spurt that he went on really hurt us."" ""You know, I wish we were all `inactive' on our 24-point games,"" Stevens said. ""We let our guard down even for a split-second and they made us pay all night."" HOME-COURT EDGE Kerr, whose team was playing the fourth of five straight road games, was prepared for the struggle of playing at the TD Garden on a Saturday night against a Celtics team that hadn't lost at home in more than a month. ""It's a tough place to play, and an 8:30 start, which means an extra hour of beer time for the local Bostonians,"" Kerr said before the start. ""So probably going to be a little loud in there tonight."" TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr needed 377 games to reach 300 wins. Pat Riley needed 416. ... Durant dribbled out the clock at the end of the first quarter and then, after the buzzer, sank a half-court shot that didn't count. ... It's the third time in five seasons the Warriors have ended an opponent's 10-game home winning streak. They snapped San Antonio's 48-game streak in 2016 and a 13-game streak for Cleveland in 2018.... DeMarcus Cousins picked up his fourth foul early in the third and his fifth about three minutes into the second half. He played just 24 minutes but had 15 points and eight rebounds. Celtics: Irving had his 11th double-double with points and assists. The last Celtic with 11 of that kind of double-double was Larry Bird in 1986-87. ... Irving has six straight games of at least 25 points, matching the longest such streak in his career.","401071405"
"DENVER --  If Nikola Jokic was fired up over his one-game suspension, it was hard to tell. ""He came back and did what we expect him to do,"" coach Michael Malone said after Jokic's seventh triple-double of the season led the Denver Nuggets past the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers 126-100 Saturday night. ""He was a huge part of our attack and made the right play time and time again,"" Malone said after watching Jokic score 32 points, pull down 18 rebounds and dish out 10 assists. ""He's proven why he's an All-NBA type player. Thank goodness he's in a Nuggets uniform."" The 76ers gave leading scorer Joel Embiid the night off, robbing fans of a Jokic-Embiid showdown but allowing their star to get a six-day midseason break before their next game Tuesday night against the Lakers in Los Angeles. Jokic, the Nuggets' leader in points, rebounds and assists, missed Denver's rout of the Phoenix Suns on Friday night when he was handed a one-game suspension for leaving the bench during an altercation in Utah earlier in the week. Malone said he didn't think Jokic would be any more fired up than usual for his return and instead would focus on helping ""his team win another game at home against a quality team from the Eastern Conference."" Jokic did just that, scoring 17 first-quarter points on his way to a 20-point, 12-rebound first-half as the Nuggets, who led wire to wire for the second straight night, took a 77-68 lead into the locker room. ""That's the Joker we like to see, coming out physical and aggressive early,"" Torrey Craig said. ""When he's aggressive like that, we're a great team."" Through three quarters, Jokic had 28 points, 17 boards and nine assists, and he got the triple-double shortly after re-entering the game midway through the fourth quarter with a half-court pass to Malik Beasley, whose dunk put Denver ahead 118-104. ""He did what he does all the time,"" Gary Harris said. ""He came out and was aggressive. We asserted ourselves early and got the job done."" Jokic sat out the final few minutes, leaving him two boards shy of the rare 30-20-10 triple-double. While his teammates are starting to expect triple-doubles out of him on a regular basis, Jokic isn't focusing on them. ""I don't think going into the game I need these points, rebounds. I just play hard and try to win,"" Jokic said. ""If it happens, I like it, and it's cool."" Jimmy Butler (sprained right wrist) and Wilson Chandler (left hamstring tightness) also sat out for the 76ers, who got 22 points from JJ Redick and 20 from Corey Brewer but never led. ""We weren't 100 percent,"" said Ben Simmons, who scored 14. ""We were missing Jimmy and Joel and Chandler. Pretty big puzzles on this team."" This isn't a game the 76ers will dwell on, though. ""We did all right considering what we had to play with tonight,"" Redick said. ""Overall, we competed. We made mistakes. Young guys made mistakes. You move on."" RARE SCRATCH The Nuggets were hoping to have their opening night lineup back for the first time since the second game of their season, but guard Jamal Murray was scratched after rolling his left ankle Friday night. This was only the second time he'd missed a game in his three-year career. Murray played all 82 games his rookie season and missed a game last year because of a concussion. Over his last 10 games, Murray has averaged 17.9 points and 4.4 assists. ""I'm worried about it,"" Malone said. ""He's been battling the ankle for a little while now and just when it was starting to feel really good he rolls it once again. I saw it this afternoon. It was really, really swollen. So, he'll continue to get treatment round-the-clock, and we'll see about his availability in Memphis."" TIP-INS 76ers: With just three offensive rebounds in the first half, the 76ers managed a single second-chance point, three fewer than the Nuggets, who had just five offensive boards, three from Jokic. ... Mike Muscala hit at trio of 3-pointers early in the first half. Nuggets: Denver's 77-point first half was a season high, besting the 74 the Nuggets scored against Dallas on Dec. 18. ... Colorado Rockies SS Trevor Story missed the pregame free throw, failing to match ace Kyle Freeland, who swished his shot on opening night. ... New Denver Broncos coach Vic Fangio got a standing ovation when he was shown on the big screen.","401071406"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  With the Trail Blazers playing without All-Star guard Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum reminded everybody just how good Portland's other guard are. McCollum had 28 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double, leading the Trail Blazers to a 120-111 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. ""CJ was terrific, maybe his best all-around game of the year,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Seth Curry, who got the start in Lillard's place, scored 22 points. Maurice Harkless also had a season-high 16 points to go with five rebounds. ""Without (Lillard) out there I was just talking a little bit more, initiate the offense and tried to keep everybody involved,"" McCollum said. Trae Young had 30 points and eight assists to lead the Hawks. McCollum had 10 points and three assists in the third quarter to give Portland a three-point lead heading to the fourth. Atlanta pulled to 101-100 with 7:17 remaining, but Curry scored 11 points during the Trail Blazers' 13-0 game-closing run. ""I was trying to get (Curry) some shots, he's a very great shooter, a guy who can read on-ball and off-ball screens,"" McCollum said. ""I tried to take advantage of their defensive lapses, they were paying a lot of attention to me. I was trying to be aggressive and mix in making plays."" ""When they hit 3s, you feel it,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said of the Blazers' final run. ""And Curry did that late in the game with three 3s. And we hit a stretch where we couldn't get anything to go down."" Stotts thought Curry's night, in particular, was special for him. ""It's been tough for him, coming off the bench and playing behind Dame and CJ and coming into a new team,"" Stotts said. ""All that -- it's been a rough transition, but I think he showed tonight what he's capable of. He stepped up, I mean we needed a performance like that from him tonight."" After Atlanta jumped out to a 11-7 lead, the Blazers outscored the Hawks 33-19 to build a 10-point lead after the first quarter. The Hawks quickly cut the Blazers lead to three in the early moments of the second quarter. Dwayne Dedmon's dunk with the 7:39 left in the quarter gave Atlanta a one-point lead and the Hawks led by as many as six. Atlanta held a one-point lead at halftime with Collins and rookie Trae Young leading the way. McCollum got off to an early start on a big night, with 14 points, eight rebounds and five assists in the first half. ""CJ scores the ball, great passing, going after it on the boards,"" Young said about McCollum. ""CJ does what CJ does -- everything."" Blazers sixth man Evan Turner was forced from the game at halftime with a sore left Achilles. TIP-INS Hawks: John Collins has made a big jump from his rookie year in scoring, averaging 19.5 points per game, which is nearly double his average from last season. But another area in which he's improved has been on the offensive rebounding. Collins began the day averaging 3.8 offensive rebounds per game, a full rebound more than last year. In terms of percentage, Collins has improved by two percentage points and he's just outside of the top-10 in that category. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce commended him for his willingness to embrace the mentality of dominating mismatches. ""And it's easy to get frustrated when we don't find him when there is a guard defending him. The effort part that he's shown over the last month or two months. When there's a guard on him, we want to find him but if we don't, go to work. Because now you a small down there. He's completely bought into it. I said it a while back, it's like a new toy for him."" Trail Blazers: Lillard had been dealing with nagging injuries over the last few weeks. With the Blazers just returning home after a three-game road trip, the team elected to rest Lillard who has been listed with a bruised right hand and a sore right knee. ""There's nothing serious,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""He almost didn't play against Phoenix so I think it's just, he needs a day."" Lillard was one of only four Blazers who had played in each of the first 50 games this season. The choice to rest Lillard comes at a brief break in the Blazers schedule. After Saturday, the Blazers only have one game in the span of nine days.","401071407"
"CHICAGO --  Cleveland Cavaliers coach Larry Drew looked at a rare victory as a learning experience. Jordan Clarkson and Alec Burks each scored 18 points, Cedi Osman added 17 and the Cavaliers ended a six-game losing streak, rallying to beat the Chicago Bulls 104-101 on Sunday. ""We haven't been in that situation often,"" Drew said. ""But when we do get there, I think it is important moving forward that we learn how to play down the stretch, learn how to execute, we learn how to, defensively, get the stops that we need."" NBA-worst Cleveland improved to 10-41 after dropping 18 of 19. Matthew Dellavedova had 16 points, and Rodney Hood added 14. Burks had a follow basket with 17 seconds left to put Cleveland up 102-101. After Chicago's Kris Dunn missed at the rim at the other end, Dellavedova hit a pair of free throws to close out the scoring. The Bulls' Zach LaVine missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer. Cleveland's defense held Chicago to one field goal in the final 3:50. Lauri Markkanen led Chicago with 21 points and 15 rebounds, and LaVine had 17 points and 12 rebounds. The Bulls have lost three straight and 13 of 14.  They've also lost to the 15-win Atlanta Hawks during that span. ""It's frustrating, but we just have to keep our heads up,"" Markkanen said.

""We're growing, guys are starting to pick up on things,"" Clarkson said. ""What are we 50 (games) in? It's got to start showing now, and I think guys are starting to pick up on things."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. was scoreless in 17 minutes off the bench in his second game back from a sprained right knee. ... Cleveland let go G Cameron Payne after declining to sign him for the remainder of the season. Payne's second 10-day contract expired Saturday.

"LOS ANGELES --  Without Danilo Gallinari lately, the Los Angeles Clippers have gone small. Their sparkplug has been Patrick Beverley. The veteran guard had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists on Sunday, helping the Clippers beat the Sacramento Kings 122-108 for their third straight victory. ""Pat has been MVP or key to us in this run,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""He's a tough-guy competitor and holds every guy accountable on the floor."" Missing Gallinari for five games due to lower back spasms, the Clippers went 3-1 on their recent road trip. They opened with a win at San Antonio in which Beverley became the only player 6-foot-1 or shorter to log 18-plus points, 12-plus rebounds, five-plus assists, four-plus steals and one block or more in over 25 seasons. ""We're sharing the ball and everybody is playing well,"" Beverley said. ""We're just hanging our hat on defense. We're locked in from shootaround to the end of the game.""

Sacramento never led, but made a run to start the fourth. Down 87-76, the Kings twice closed within five. They got a basket and rim-rattling dunk by Willie Cauley-Stein and six straight points by Bogdan Bogdanovic. Then the Clippers took off.

The Kings cut their deficit from 16 points to seven in the third. Fox and Iman Shumpert combined to score 15 of Sacramento's 17 points to start the period. Fox hit a 3-pointer and Shumpert added two from long range. The Clippers got a 3-pointer from Harris and a dunk by Harrell to lead 87-76 going into the fourth. Los Angeles got off to a fast start. The Clippers shot 52 percent from the floor in the first half and led by as many as 25 points. TIP-INS Kings: They fell to 11-15 on the road and 5-10 vs the West. Clippers: F Gallinari likely will return in the next game or two. He has missed five in a row. ... Harrell turned 25 on Saturday. ... Williams' first triple-double at Chicago on Friday occurred in his 904th career game. Only Zach Randolph at 974 games logged his first later in his career.

The eighth-year pro is seeking his first All-Star berth. ""I feel like I've been playing at that level,"" he said.

As he stood at the free-throw line late in the game, the M-V-P chants that had been reserved for Russell Westbrook in recent years rained down on George. ""He was doing everything,"" said Antetokounmpo, another All-Star starter. ""Making 3s, mid-range, dunking, floaters. It was a little of everything. He was playing amazing. Down the stretch, you know where the ball's going to go. It's going to go to Paul George, and he closed the game out for them and he played the right way."" Westbrook had 13 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists for his 16th triple-double of the season and No. 120 for his career. Jerami Grant scored 16 points and Terrance Ferguson added 15 for the Thunder. Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 18 rebounds for Milwaukee, and Khris Middleton added 22 points. Eric Bledsoe hit a 3-pointer with just over a minute left to cut Oklahoma City's lead to three, but George drained a 3-pointer in Malcolm Brogdon's face at the end of the shot clock to push the margin back up to six. ""I've got a smaller guy on me,"" George said. ""Just shoot over the top. Just took advantage of that."" George scored 21 points in the first half to help the Thunder take a 56-42 lead. Antetokounmpo missed all six of his shots before the break and scored just three points. ""Giannis had some good looks he normally makes, he didn't make, but then I think individually they were good on him,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Jerami Grant and then a few other guys take the challenge individually. A lot of help. Guys are swarming him, so credit to them."" Steven Adams, Oklahoma City's lumbering 7-foot center, got the crowd amped up with a surprise early in the third quarter. He got a steal, dribbled three quarters of the way down the court and converted a layup to give the Thunder a 64-52 lead. The Thunder led 82-66 before the Bucks hit three straight 3-pointers, including two from Middleton. Oklahoma City held on to lead 89-79 at the end of the third quarter. TIP-INS Bucks: Brook Lopez made all four of his shots in the first quarter, all 3-pointers. He finished with 19 points. ... Antetokounmpo had 10 rebounds in the first half. Thunder: Westbrook made just 5 of 20 shots. ... Grant had five blocks. ... Made just 14 of 25 free throws. NOEL STEPS UP Adams left in the first quarter with a right ankle sprain, but he returned in the second quarter. Nerlens Noel stepped in and played just over 17 minutes, finishing with six points, six rebounds and two blocks. ""Coach trusted me with extended minutes when Steve was down,"" he said. ""I wanted to do my best job of changing the game. Regardless of what side of the ball it's on, I just want to do what I do as a player.""","401071410"
"DALLAS --  Even as a 19-year-old rookie, Dallas' Luka Doncic continues to make his case for an NBA All-Star spot. Kawhi Leonard is already one, and came through to spoil Doncic's career-best game Sunday night. Leonard, voted last week to start the All-Star Game for the third time, scored 33 points to help the Toronto Raptors overcome a triple-double from the Dallas rookie in a 123-120 win over the Mavericks. Doncic, who will turn 20 on Feb. 28, finished with a career-high 35 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists to become the first teenager in NBA history with two triple-doubles. However, he and his teammates faltered down the stretch, losing a seven-point, fourth-quarter lead after coming back from 12 down at halftime. ""For me, what matters is the victory,"" Doncic said. ""(The triple-double) was special for sure, but it would be even more if we got the win."" Pascal Siakam's three-point play snapped a 108-all tie with 3:56 remaining as the Raptors recovered from a poor third quarter and a 92-85 deficit early in the fourth. Danny Green's floater in the lane extended Toronto's lead to 116-112 with 1:34 remaining. Harrison Barnes missed two critical free throws for the Mavericks, and Leonard scored on a driving lay-up and then converted a free throw after a turnover by Doncic. The Raptors iced the game at the line. Leonard credited the team's switch to a zone defense in the fourth quarter to help slow the Mavs down. ""I think it just helps us communicate more,"" Leonard said. ""We're not too consistent in communicating when we're guarding man to man, but the zone it makes us talk and make us get into positions to be in the help spots."" Kyle Lowry scored 19 points for Toronto and Siakam had 14. Trailing 70-58 at the half, Dallas turned the game around by outscoring Toronto 30-15 in the third quarter, one in which the Raptors missed their first 10 shots enroute to making only 4 of 19 field goals. Toronto was also assessed four technical fouls in the quarter -- three for defensive 3-second violations. ""The third quarter, we got stagnant."" Leonard said. ""Our defense got stagnant."" MAKING HIS CASE Doncic came in second to LeBron James in the fan voting for All-Star starters in the Western Conference but was not selected as a starter once media and player votes were counted. He once again turned the fourth quarter into a case for his inclusion, scoring 13 points, including a coast-to-coast dunk that gave Dallas a 99-93 lead. When the Raptors pulled to 101-99, Doncic answered with a long 3 to reach 30 points for the sixth time this season. Doncic got his 10th assist to complete the triple-double by feeding DeAndre Jordan for an alley-oop dunk with 3:29 left in the fourth. ""We couldn't get him out of rhythm because he was low and strong and crossing over,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""Then, with a burst he was into the paint. And when we did get enough help there, he'd hang in the air until the last second and throw that incredible two-handed pass out to the right corner. He's something else."" WINNING AT THE LINES The Raptors made 17 of 34 3s to the Mavericks' 11 for 36. And despite playing on the road, Toronto converted 32 of 38 free throws, while Dallas shot 23 of 34. Every Mavericks player who attempted at least one free throw missed one, and even Dirk Nowitzki, a career 88 percent shooter from the stripe, missed 2 of 3. ""We certainly have guys that are capable of making free throws,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It's a bit of an uncharacteristic thing."" TIP-INS Raptors: Leonard has scored 20 or more points in 22 straight games but has been inactive eight times during his scoring streak. Mavericks: Barnes scored 14 for the Mavericks and Dennis Smith Jr. and Dorian Finney-Smith had 13 each. ... Wesley Matthews became the first undrafted player in NBA history -- and 31st overall -- to make 1,500 3-pointers when he hit his second of the game with 5:36 left in the first quarter. ... Smith received a technical foul in the first quarter when, after scoring a lay-up over a Serge Ibaka, flexed his muscles over the fallen Raptors player.","401071411"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden had another huge offensive game Sunday night, scoring 40 points in Houston's comeback win over the Orlando Magic. But it was the point guard's defense that coach Mike D'Antoni raved about after Harden blocked three shots and helped limit Orlando 7-footer Nikola Vucevic to just two points in the second half. ""I just told James they voted him in the wrong place. They got him as a guard in the All-Star (Game) -- he should be a center,"" D'Antoni said with a chuckle. ""That's what he is. He's a point-center and his defense in the post and right behind him is Eric Gordon ... is really good."" Harden didn't answer when asked what he thought about D'Antoni calling him a ""point-center"" but he did smile and he was still laughing as he walked off following the question. Harden's 40 points included five critical ones down the stretch to lead the Rockets to a 103-98 victory. The reigning MVP extended his streak of 30-point games to 23, which ranks fourth in NBA history behind three such streaks by Wilt Chamberlain. Harden, who had 11 rebounds and six assists, has scored 40 or more points in 12 of his last 17 games, including a franchise-record 61 against the Knicks last week. Houston trailed by as many as 16 and never led until there were about four minutes remaining. The game was tied with about 75 seconds left when a 3-pointer by Harden put the Rockets up 98-95. ""I thought I could go under and kind of keep him on the side and of course he made it,"" Evan Fournier said of his defense on the play. ""It was a dumb mistake."" Terrence Ross missed a 3 on the other end and Harden added a step-back jumper with 30 seconds left to stretch the lead. Harden got his third block when he swatted away a shot by Fournier, and Chris Paul added two free throws with 13.6 seconds remaining to secure Houston's third straight victory. Paul had 12 points and six assists after missing the previous 17 games with a strained left hamstring. The Rockets went 12-5 in Paul's absence and he said his return doesn't change much for Harden. ""James is going to be James,"" Paul said. ""I don't care who's on the court -- me, anybody -- he's going to be him. We need him to be him. That's why he's the MVP."" Harden was glad to have Paul back. ""He looked good. He looked like he had an extra pep in his step,"" Harden said. ""He looked great and he made some big-time shots. It was good to see him back on the court."" Aaron Gordon had 23 points to lead the Magic, who have dropped six of seven. The Rockets got another strong game from Kenneth Faried, signed last week to fill in while Clint Capela recovers from thumb surgery. Faried finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and two steals. Harden scored 38 points in a 116-109 loss to the Magic this month despite going 1 for 17 from 3-point range. He fared better on Sunday, making four of 12 attempts on a night when Houston hit 12 of 36 tries. Orlando had an eight-point lead before Houston used an 11-3 spurt to tie it at 87 with seven minutes left. Paul drained two 3-pointers during that stretch and Gerald Green added a third. Ross made a 3 for Orlando to power a 5-2 mini-run that put the Magic back on top 92-89 with five minutes left. But then Houston scored the next four points, capped by a layup from P.J. Tucker, to make it 93-92 and give the Rockets their first lead of the game about a minute later. The Magic led by seven at halftime and had pushed it to 76-61 midway through the third quarter after scoring nine straight points, five by Aaron Gordon. Eric Gordon made a 3 for Houston's first points in almost four minutes after that, starting an 11-4 run that cut the lead to 80-72 with about a minute left in the quarter. Aaron Gordon added a basket for Orlando and Paul hit one for Houston to leave the Magic up by eight entering the fourth. TIP-INS Magic: Vucevic had 19 points, 17 rebounds and five assists. ... Fournier added 18 points. ... Orlando shot 10 of 35 on 3-pointers. Rockets: Faried has scored 10 points or more in each of his four games with the team. ... D'Antoni said before the game Brandon Knight was available after missing the previous seven games with a sore left knee, but he did not play. LIKE MIKE Harden has scored 40 or more points 18 times this season to make him the first player since Michael Jordan (22) in 1986-87 to have at least 18 40-point games within the first 46 games of a season.","401071412"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  After going 2 for 12 from the field in the first half, the shot that turned the tide for Donovan Mitchell was a free throw following a technical foul in the third quarter. Forget the fact he missed it. Mitchell said he was buoyed by the fact that Ricky Rubio, who usually shoots technical free throws, told him to take the shot instead. ""It was one of those things where it was like my teammates were still backing me,"" Mitchell said after scoring 29 points in Utah's 125-111 win over Minnesota on Sunday night. ""And then we ran another play for me right out of that. I think that just shows the trust my teammates have in me."" That call resulted in a three-point play for Mitchell, who had 13 points in the third quarter and led the surging Jazz to their ninth win in 10 games. Shot after shot from the perimeter brought groan after groan from the Minnesota crowd as Utah shot 71 percent (27 of 38) during the second half for its second victory in three nights over the Timberwolves. ""The game wasn't going the way I wanted to offensively, but I wasn't panicking,"" Mitchell said. ""Like I said, when you have teammates that back you like that, it's awesome. It makes it easy."" Mitchell finished 10 of 22 from the floor and went 7 for 10 at the foul line. Rubio added 18 points with eight assists, and Rudy Gobert scored 17. Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota with 35 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22. Jerryd Bayless had a season-high 19. Mitchell and Wiggins got hot trading baskets in the third. Minnesota briefly led 83-82 late in the period before Mitchell helped key a 21-9 run. Utah opened the fourth with three straight 3-pointers -- two by Kyle Korver and one from Joe Ingles -- to rebuild the lead to nine. ""Dribble penetration, that occurs a lot when you get sucked in and we don't take care of things at the point of attack. Then we have to help each other and then open 3s occur,"" Wolves interim coach Ryan Saunders said. Utah led by as many as 14 in the fourth. The Timberwolves pulled within seven multiple times but couldn't get another big stop on defense. PATIENCE PAYS OFF Along with Bayless, Luol Deng also had a season-high 15 points for Minnesota. Bayless has made the most of his opportunity filling in for the Wolves' banged-up backcourt, and Deng has seen his playing time increase since Saunders took over when Tom Thibodeau was fired. ""It means a lot,"" Bayless said. ""Obviously it's been a tough couple of years for me, realistically. So this is the first time I've really played in a long time, really got a chance to really play. So I'm just thankful for that, and hopefully it stays."" Deng went 5 of 6 from the floor, including 3 for 4 from 3-point range. ""It feels good. I've just been staying ready, knowing that it's a long season, staying positive and staying ready,"" Deng said. DEFENDING TOWNS Towns' 22 points were quiet compared to his team-high 33 on Friday night in Utah. The Jazz held him to two field goals in the second half. ""I had to focus more, not giving him the straight lane to the basket, make him earn everything,"" Gobert said. ""We did a good job as a team keeping him off the ball."" TIP-INS Jazz: Korver, a 16-year veteran, entered averaging 20.4 minutes in 28 games with Utah, nearly five more minutes per game than he was playing for the Cavaliers before they traded him in November. ""Kyle thinks he can play 42 minutes and he prepares that way,"" coach Quin Snyder said of his 37-year-old shooting guard. ""Kyle, at a certain point in his career became -- I don't know if I want to say obsessive -- but unbelievably dedicated to taking care of his body. That's why he's playing at the level he's playing at, at the age he is."" ... Utah didn't commit a turnover in the first quarter. Timberwolves: Second-leading scorer Derrick Rose, who dressed on Friday but didn't play, sat out with a sore right ankle. Rose joined G Jeff Teague (foot), F Robert Covington (knee) and G Tyus Jones (sprained ankle) on the injury report. Saunders said Covington, who hasn't played since Dec. 31, has been doing more work on the stationary bike. ... Josh Okogie caught an elbow from Gobert to the back of the head in the first quarter when both were going for a rebound. Gobert dunked on the play and Okogie stayed down for several moments before getting up.","401071413"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Gregg Popovich values every possession, so an uncontested dunk by the Washington Wizards on the opening play did not sit well. The Spurs coach quickly rose to call a timeout 16 seconds into the game to forcefully reinforce that communication is critical to defense. LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and the Spurs regrouped to beat the Wizards 132-119 on Sunday night to snap a two-game skid at home. ""We played the last two home games poorly and he wasn't going to let us slide with those small mistakes,"" forward Davis Bertans said of the early timeout. The Spurs were without leading scorer DeMar DeRozan, but had seven players in double figures. Bertans had a season-high 21 points after missing the previous two games due to personal reasons. Backcourt starters Derrick White and Bryn Forbes added 16 points each. Washington, which had won five of seven, lost its 19th straight in San Antonio. Tomas Satoransky had a season-high 21 points, which were matched by Bradley Beal. It was the fifth time the Spurs have scored 130-plus points this season, but it was their early defense that drew Popovich's ire after the Wizards' Thomas Bryant had an uncontested dunk shortly after Washington won the opening tip. ""It all starts with the first play,"" Forbes said. ""That kind of sets the tone for us. I think that's what he's trying to do, set that tone and show how serious he was about the first play and the beginning of games. We just made a dumb mistake to start the game off."" The Spurs would hold the Wizards to 2-for-9 shooting while going on runs of 11-2 and 15-2 in the first quarter and extending their lead to 13 points. But their defense was still absent in the first half. Washington rallied after each run with crisp ball movement and its final lead came at 69-67 with 1:25 remaining in the first half. ""It was pretty much whoever was going to defend first was going to win and it came out that they defended,"" Beal said. A few timeouts and a few choice words by Popovich helped the Spurs turn things around in the second half. ""He didn't even cuss that much, that's a surprise,"" Bertans said. ""He was just kind of talking to us, explaining the situation and asking, `What the hell is going on?' Just asking us to communicate."" The Spurs held the Wizards to 17 points on 7-for-24 shooting in the third quarter in regaining a double-digit lead. San Antonio's bench also outscored Washington's 54-27 led by Bertans. The 6-foot-10 forward from Latvia leads the league in 3-point shooting at 49 percent and continued that hot shooting against the Wizards. Bertans was 5 for 8 on 3-pointers and 8 for 11 overall. ""We had trouble keeping up with Bertans, he was all over the floor,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""We couldn't catch him on his 3s, he kept going by us on his dribbles. He got everything that he wanted."" TIP-INS Wizards: Washington has not won in San Antonio this century, last defeating the Spurs on the road Dec. 11, 1999. Mitch Richmond scored 31 points in leading the Wizards to a 99-89 victory. ... Forward Sam Dekker missed the game with back spasms. ... Center Ian Mahinmi sat out with a sprained right thumb. ... Satoransky's previous high was 20 points, which he scored twice with the most recent Jan. 24 against Golden State. Spurs: DeRozan missed his second straight game and third in two weeks with a left leg injury. DeRozan first sat out with a sore left ankle against Minnesota on Jan. 18 and missed the past two games with a sore left knee. San Antonio is 2-0 without the 10-year veteran. ... Pau Gasol made his sixth start of the season, giving him 1,150 career starts to move past Ray Allen for 19th in league history. ... Bertans has eight career games with at least five 3-pointers. STILL OUT Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray appears to be making significant progress in his rehabilitation from right ACL surgery, but will still not return this season. ""Zero,"" Popovich said of the chances of possible return. ""It's an ACL. Unless there's some new deal out there that someone came up with that we don't know about."" Murray was injured Oct. 7 while driving to the basket in a preseason game against Houston and underwent surgery Oct. 19. The Spurs said at the time that the third-year guard would miss the entire season and have not altered that prognosis since. Murray tweeted a video Saturday showing his progress in a recent workout. With no sleeve or brace on his right knee, the 6-foot-5 guard shoots a jumper and then makes a series of quick crossovers before tossing up a runner. ""God is great, back perfecting my craft,"" Murray wrote. ""Fall down and get back up always!"" EXCLUSIVE CLUB Patty Mills became the 13th player in franchise history to play 500 games with the Spurs. ""When I first heard it, I was like, `That's it,' "" Mills said. ""It felt like it was a lot more. I don't know if it was the amount of times we get yelled at."" Of the dozen other players, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, George Gervin, Sean Elliott, Avery Johnson, Bruce Bowen and Johnny Moore all had their numbers retired. Manu Ginobili will become the eighth member of the 500-game club to have his jersey retired during a ceremony March 28 and Tony Parker will become the ninth once he retires.","401071414"
"NEW YORK --  Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat got a big lift from an unlikely source. Wayne Ellington scored each of his 19 points in the second half, and the Heat handed the New York Knicks their ninth straight loss with a 106-97 victory on Sunday night. Miami had seven players score in double figures in its second straight win. Wade had 15 points and 10 assists, and Hassan Whiteside finished with 13 points and 16 rebounds. Ellington made four 3-pointers in just his third appearance since Dec. 26. It was his first game in double figures since he scored 12 points in a 102-100 victory over Utah on Dec. 2. ""No matter what else is going on you never stop putting in the work,"" Ellington said. ""You get out what you put in. I am a firm believer of that. It's been tough. But these guys right here in this locker room they always feed me that confidence, they feed me that energy. Tonight I was able to contribute and help get a win."" Wade, who plans to retire at the end of the season, received a standing ovation from the Madison Square Garden crowd when he was taken out in the final seconds. ""Over the years, Dwyane has risen to a different level in this building,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It's electric and he comes alive in this type of environment. It's cool to see that at the end."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 22 points for New York, and Trey Burke had 16. The Knicks have dropped 17 of 18 overall. Former Knicks star Carmelo Anthony watched from a courtside seat and waved to the cheering crowd when he was acknowledged on the scoreboard in the first quarter. Anthony, a Brooklyn native who played for New York for seven seasons, was traded from Houston to Chicago last week. The Bulls have no plans to play Anthony and are looking to either trade the 10-time All-Star before the Feb. 7 deadline or ultimately waive him and make him a free agent. ""You got a guy who can still help a team and affect the game,"" Wade said. ""It's about the right situation, and hopefully he is able to get back out there and go out the way he wants to go out when it's time."" The Knicks trailed 85-72 before putting together an 18-5 run. Hardaway's 3-pointer tied it at 90 with 4:01 left. Miami then regained control with a 10-2 spurt. Whiteside started the decisive sequence with a tiebreaking layup, and Ellington's 3 made it 100-92 with 1:08 left. James Johnson also scored 13 points for the Heat, and Josh Richardson finished with 12. Justise Winslow and Kelly Olynyk each had 11 points. TIP-INS Heat: Derrick Jones, Jr. hurt his right knee when he was fouled by Allonzo Trier on a drive to the basket with 10:45 left in the second quarter. Jones was carried by teammates to the locker room. Knicks: Damyean Dotson added 14 points. . New York leads the all-time series with Miami 64-57. . Emmanuel Mudiay, the Knicks' second-leading scorer, missed his second consecutive game with a strained left shoulder. . Frank Ntilikina suffered a groin injury in the second quarter and did not return.

The Heat put together a season-best five-game winning streak from December 14-23.","401071415"
"Lance Stephenson says that Michael Jackson's 'Beat it' was playing in his head during his air guitar performance. (0:19) LOS ANGELES --  Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton gave his short-handed team one important key going into Sunday's game against Phoenix: Attack the paint. The Lakers were able to do that, and in the process snapped a three-game losing streak with a 116-102 victory over the Suns. Ivica Zubac and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope each scored 24 points and Brandon Ingram added 22 as Los Angeles won for the first time with LeBron James and Lonzo Ball both out of the lineup. Walton was also missing Kyle Kuzma (hip) and Tyson Chandler (rest). Still, the Lakers dominated the inside against a small Phoenix lineup as it had a 70-46 advantage in points in the paint. ""I was boxing out my guy and my teammates were also boxing out their guys. Their guards weren't able to fly in and get the boards,"" said Zubac, who also had a career-high 16 rebounds. The Lakers' domination in the paint also opened up the perimeter. They were 10 of 23 on 3-pointers, including an 8-of-15 clip in the second half. ""When you're getting downhill and putting pressure on the rim like that, when you do get 3s, they have a tendency to go in more often,"" Walton said. ""We needed a win and we got a real nice game."" Devin Booker scored 21 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 17 and Mikal Bridges 16 for Phoenix, which has dropped eight straight for its second-longest losing streak of the season. The Suns dropped 10 in a row from Nov. 25 to Dec. 11. Phoenix's Deandre Ayton, the first pick in the NBA draft, missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left ankle. Rookie guard De'Anthony Melton missed his second game because of a sprained right ankle. While coach Igor Kokoskov is hopeful of having Ayton back this week, he said Melton will miss a significant amount of time. Richaun Holmes returned after missing the past four games with a sprained right foot and scored 12 points with 10 rebounds. ""They were attacking our bodies, they were attacking the paint and the rim. We were passive. We were just defending ourselves,"" Kokoskov said. ""We have to guard the yard. There was no secret."" The Lakers jumped out to a 12-2 lead less than five minutes into the game as the Suns missed eight of their first nine shots from the field. Phoenix found its shooting stroke, though, and went on a 14-4 run, which included three straight 3-pointers, to tie it at 16. It would be tied three more times in the first quarter before the Lakers went on a 6-2 run the final 1:06 to lead 31-27 at the end of the first. Los Angeles began to steadily pull away in the second quarter and saw its lead grow to 63-46 with 1:15 remaining on Rajon Rondo's driving layup. The Lakers were 16 of 26 from the field in the quarter as they led 65-53 at halftime. Phoenix slowly cut into the Lakers' lead in the second half and got within six at 90-84 with 11:25 remaining on a three-point play by Holmes. But the Lakers put it out of reach again with a 14-4 run, which included 11 points by Lance Stephenson.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nic Batum walked over to Malik Monk after Charlotte's 101-92 win over the New York Knicks on Monday night and told the reserve guard, ""thank you."" ""The starters have played a lot of minutes lately, especially on the road,"" Batum said. ""... We feel like we had heavy legs."" Monk and the others on the Hornets' bench helped bail out the starters. Kemba Walker finished with 15 points, and Charlotte got 63 points from its bench -- including 15 from Tony Parker and 14 from Monk, who added four clutch 3-pointers in the fourth quarter as the Hornets handed the Knicks their 10th straight loss. The Hornets entered the fourth quarter tied, but Monk scored 12 points during a pivotal 17-1 run. As they did in a 119-117 loss at Madison Square Garden last month, the Hornets struggled to shake the Knicks, shooting 36 percent overall and just 5 of 25 from beyond the arc in the first three quarters. But trailing 75-73, Monk knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers, one coming on a nifty play from Walker, who delivered a wraparound pass from underneath the basket to an open Monk at the top of the key. Monk and Walker accounted for all 17 points during the crucial run. Walker finished just 5 of 16 from the field, but made a big step-back 3 from the corner and assisted on three of Monk's 3s. The Hornets were 6 of 8 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter. Monk has struggled through some shooting slumps during the season and his defense has cost him playing time. But Hornets coach James Borrego said he's getting better at both, particularly since the team's recent West Coast trip. ""You're going to miss shots, there's going to be days when you miss shots, but it's in your mind to keep going,"" Monk said. ""When you keep shooting the same way, the ball is going to fall in, so I just kept my same routine, kept shooting the same and I was able to knock them down."" Said Borrego: ""He's one of those dynamic offensive players. He can get you 15 in a heartbeat. He can get hot quick. And I think he's getting better."" Kevin Knox had 19 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. 17 for the struggling Knicks, who have won one game since beating the Hornets on Dec. 14. Knicks coach David Fizdale said his team continues to struggle against teams that switch on defense. ""Right now, it's about getting our guys to learn how to play against switching and not holding the basketball -- it is our Achilles heel right now, learning how to play against a switching defense,"" Fizdale said. TIP INS Knicks: Outrebounded by the Hornets 53-45. Hornets: Walker spoke to the crowd before the game and thanked them for voting for him and helping him become an All-Star game starter for the first time. ... Improved to 17-8 at home. ALLEN SEES TIME With Frank Ntilikina and Emmanuel Mudiay out, the Knicks brought up Kadeem Allen and he finished with eight points in 18 minutes. Allen played three years at Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina -- the same school as NBA great and Hornets owner Michael Jordan -- before transferring prior to his senior season. ""It was cool playing at Laney. I got a couple of Jordans (shoes) and it was pretty cool to be represented by Jordan at that level,"" Allen said. As for his future, he could see some playing time in the coming games with injuries mounting for New York. ""He's come a long way since we first got him,"" Fizdale said. ""I'm just really happy with his growth and he fits our identity. He's tough. He guards. He shares the ball. I just really, really like this kid."" BENCH PLAY Borrego was pleased with the play of his bench, as Willy Hernangomez had 11 points and 11 rebounds and rookie Miles Bridges had 11 points and eight rebounds. ""That's when we're at our best,"" Borrego said. ""Our depth is our strength. When you look at our group, for us to get this done this season and become a better team than we are right now it's the depth of our that's going to get it done.""","401071417"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Stephen Curry's first-half shooting clinic was virtually flawless. His championship teammates pitched in, too. Curry scored 23 of his 26 points in the first half Monday and Golden State ran away with a 132-100 rout at Indiana for its league-leading 11th consecutive victory. The two-time defending champions still aren't satisfied. ""I feel like we can,"" Curry said when asked if the Warriors can get even better. ""We're not playing perfect basketball, by any stretch, but we're playing consistent, focused basketball and we're still working out some kinks with rotations and stuff like that."" It's a scary thought for the rest of the league, especially after the two-time MVP turned in another head-turning performance. Curry made his first eight shots and his first six 3-pointers, including a demoralizing 27-foot buzzer-beater that gave the Warriors a 69-48 halftime lead. He finished 10 of 13 from the field with six rebounds, three assists and two steals in just 27 minutes. DeMarcus Cousins had a season-high 22 points on a night five players scored in double figures and the Warriors had 39 assists. And all that came on the final leg of a five-game road trip without Draymond Green, who rested, and against the league's No. 1 scoring defense. ""I was a little worried about this game. Everybody's anxious to get home,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""But we finished off the trip the right way. We've been more dialed in the last month than we have all season."" Golden State has won a league-high 10 consecutive road games and swept a five-game trip for the first time since November 2014. The Pacers played without All-Star guard Victor Oladipo, who had season-ending surgery on his right knee Monday, and Tyreke Evans, Oladipo's replacement, because of a sore back. But even at full strength, they may have struggled to weather the Warriors' flurry. Indiana gave up a season-high 40 points in the first quarter, and never got closer than 16 after Curry broke a 16-16 tie by scoring eight points to start a decisive 24-6 quarter-closing run en route to its most lopsided loss this season. ""There's no doubt in my mind that this team is going on the up track,"" Pacers guard Darren Collison said. ""I think we saw tonight, playing against a team like that, how to execute and we can take something from that."" Myles Turner scored 16 points and Bojan Bogdanovic had 15 but Indiana lost for the second straight time since Oladipo was injured last week. It was the Pacers' worst loss this season. TIP-INS Warriors: Kevin Durant had 16 points and seven assists as his 22-game streak of scoring at least 20 points ended. ... Klay Thompson added 16 points. ... Jordan Bell replaced Green in the lineup and scored eight. ... The Warriors improved to 18-8 on the road, the league's best mark. ... They also snapped a two-game losing streak in the series. Pacers: Dropped to 7-6 this season without Oladipo, who missed 11 games in November and December with a sore right knee. ... Collison scored 13 points and had eight assists. ... Thaddeus Young finished with 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists. ....IndyCar drivers Ed Carpenter, James Hinchcliffe and Will Power attended the game. Power won last year's Indianapolis 500. OLADIPO UPDATE Oladipo might be out of sight, but he's not out of mind. After team officials announced Monday that Oladipo is expected to make a full recovery after undergoing surgery on a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee, the team handed out gold T-shirts with a message: ""Together 4 Vic."" And Oladipo delivered a pregame video message, thanking the fans for their support and encouraging his teammates to overcome his absence. While the Pacers have not established a timetable for his return, coach Nate McMillan acknowledged Oladipo would be on crutches for a ""couple of months"" and probably wouldn't travel with the team. ""I just spoke with him,"" McMillan said during pregame availability. ""He's doing fine. He's doing great."" HE SAID IT ""He (Curry) has this skill set you can't really fathom,"" Kerr said. ""It doesn't matter time, score -- he's always one shot away from getting on fire.""","401071418"
"Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens calls Aron Baynes and Marcus Smart the Splash Brothers of Boston. Marcus says they are ""nowhere near that"" and Baynes says that he's heard about it, but never referring to himself. (0:54) BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics blocked out an emotional loss to the Golden State Warriors over the weekend. They swatted away a franchise record-tying number of shots, too. Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart each scored 21 points, and the Celtics beat Brooklyn 112-104 on Monday night to snap the injury-riddled Nets' six-game winning streak. Aron Baynes had 16 points, Marcus Morris 15, and Al Horford and Terry Rozier each had 14 for Boston, which tied a franchise record with 16 blocked shots and won for the sixth time in seven games. Horford had 11 rebounds. The Celtics played without star guard Kyrie Irving, who was sidelined with a sore left hip. Boston lost a tough 115-111 contest against the Warriors on Saturday. ""We're professionals and you've got to move onto the next one,"" Smart said. ""We were short, Kyrie wasn't playing. A lot of guys needed to step up and they did tonight."" Brown said the Celtics wanted to carry some of the energy from the loss into the game. ""It's a hot team,"" he said. ""We wanted to come out and break some of their confidence."" D'Angelo Russell led the Nets with 25 points and Shabazz Napier had 20. Brooklyn had won 19 of its previous 24 games. ""I'm just disappointed; I didn't think we made the extra pass tonight,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said of the blocked shots. ""When they are coming, we've got to kick it for open shots. I felt like it was a little too much put your head down and go against two guys at the rim. We've got to do a better job of making that extra pass."" Brooklyn was missing five regular players. ""It is what it is. It's something that we're going into the game knowing that, so it's not our excuse,"" Russell said. ""Everybody has to step up. It's not the first time we've had to do that, but it's definitely tougher."" The Celtics took charge with an 11-0 run early in the final quarter. Brown capped the spree with a 3-pointer from the right corner, pushing Boston's lead to 102-90 with just over 7 minutes to play. Boston used a 14-2 run midway into the second quarter en route to a 60-50 halftime edge. Brown triggered the spurt with a 3 and scored seven points. TIP-INS Nets: Their next win will be the 28th, matching the total for last season. Also, they can match last season's road total of 13 with their next road victory. ... They had won 10 of their first 12 games in January. Celtics: Coach Brad Stevens explained the need to be smart handling Irving's days he doesn't play. ""He's very open and candid when he's not feeling great,"" he said. ""We're very alert to that and want to make sure we prioritize not only to the short-term health, but obviously to the long term. We were going to sit him eight to 12 games anyways, so when he has nicks and bruises it makes sense to sit."" ... F Gordon Hayward needed two stitches to close a first-quarter cut on his left hand, but he returned to the floor in the second. Smart also had a cut over his right eye. BLOCK PARTY The 16 blocked shots matched the record set on Jan. 21, 1983, against Chicago. Boston had a season-high 12 blocked shots -- with Horford getting a half dozen -- in the opening half, matching the most by an NBA team for a half this season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The New York Knicks also had a dozen. STICK TO THE PLAN As one of the NBA's surprise teams, Atkinson has tried not to waver from his concept on how to turn things around after two losing seasons. It's worked so far. ""What's hard when you're losing is to stick with that culture, not go off the rails and start changing things,"" Atkinson said. ""We did change some things, but the basic foundation of what we wanted to do was established in the beginning and kept on the same way. It's great that we're starting to reap some results."" BANGED UP Atkinson thinks his team has learned the hard way about dealing with injuries. ""That's been part of our maturity and our confidence, not looking for the guys that are out,"" he said. They were missing six players Monday -- five that get decent minutes: F Treveon Graham (sore lower back), G Spencer Dinwiddie (surgery Monday, right thumb), F Allen Crabbe (sore right knee), F Jared Dudley (strained left hamstring), F Caris LeVert (right foot injury) and G/F Dzanan Musa (left shoulder injury).","401071419"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets are off to the best start in franchise history. It only took until the last half of the fourth quarter for them to look the part Monday night. Jokic scored 24 points and made a go-ahead hook shot with 28.9 seconds left, and the Nuggets overcame a 25-point second-half deficit to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 95-92. The Nuggets rallied hard in the final 4 1/2 minutes, and Will Barton's 3-pointer with 43.9 seconds remaining gave them their first lead of the game at 91-89. After a 3-pointer from Memphis' Justin Holiday, Jokic's basket from 7 feet out put Denver ahead to stay. ""We just didn't give up,"" Jokic said, adding: ""That says something about the team. We don't want to quit. We were fighting."" Malik Beasley keyed the fourth-quarter burst, scoring 13 of his 18 points in the final period as the Nuggets erased a 13-point deficit with a 19-4 run. He scored seven points in that stretch and handed out the assist on Barton's basket that completed the rally, giving the Nuggets their first lead of the game. The 25-point margin was the largest of the season that Denver has overcome. The Nuggets trailed 77-60 entering the fourth. That 17-point deficit was the second-largest fourth-quarter deficit the team has come back from in franchise history. By overcoming a 19-point halftime deficit, the Nuggets matched the greatest comeback in franchise history (set in 1981). Overall, NBA teams leading by 25 or more in the second half had been 174-0 this season -- before Monday. Marc Gasol led Memphis with 28 points and nine rebounds, and Mike Conley had 23 points and 11 assists. The 25 points marked the largest regular-season blown lead ever for the Grizzlies. The atmosphere was somewhat somber in the Memphis locker room, not only because of the loss but because of the uncertainty of Gasol's and Conley's futures in Memphis, where the two players have spent their entire careers. The Grizzlies revealed last week they would entertain trade offers for the two, the longest-tenured teammates in the NBA. Memphis heads out on a three-game road trip and won't return home until Feb. 5. While still two days before the trade deadline, some wondered if this could be the last home appearance for one or both of them. ""It's been an awkward week for sure,"" Conley said. ""It's been feeling like it's our eulogy. People giving us hugs and asking for one last autograph, all that stuff. And I'm thinking: 'I'm not gone. I'm still here.'"" TIP-INS Nuggets: Barton had 20 points. ... G Jamal Murray missed his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. ... The previous two times the Nuggets started 33-15 after 48 games -- in 1976-77 and 2009-10 -- they lost the next game. ... The Nuggets had 16 first-quarter points, one off from a season-low for points in a quarter. Grizzlies: F Kyle Anderson returned to the starting lineup after missing eight games with left ankle sprain suffered Jan. 12. ... F Omri Casspi missed his second game with knee soreness. F JaMychal Green sat out with left knee soreness. ... The largest blown lead before Monday night was a 23-point advantage against the Los Angeles Lakers on April 4, 2003. ... Conley recorded his seventh double-double of the season. HALFTIME PEP TALK The Nuggets had scored at least 70 first-half points the last two games but got nowhere near that against Memphis. Denver shot 30 percent in the first quarter and finished the half at 38 percent to trail 60-41 at the break. ""I got onto our guys at halftime,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""I wasn't happy. I told my starters: 'You have five minutes to show them you guys want to play,' and in the third quarter I thought we played with great energy and effort. Really good defense.""","401071420"
"LOS ANGELES --  These young Atlanta Hawks are growing up over halfway through the season. Trae Young scored 26 points, John Collins added 22 and they beat the Los Angeles Clippers 123-118 on Monday night for the first time in nearly three years. Atlanta had lost five in a row to the Clippers dating to March 5, 2016. The Hawks earned their first win against a Pacific Division opponent this season after dropping their first five. Alex Len had 19 points and nine rebounds off the bench for the Hawks, whose starters all have less than six years in the league, including rookies Young and Kevin Huerter. ""We're fighting,"" Len said. ""We're always in games. That's what you want to see from a young team."" Tobias Harris scored 30 points for the Clippers, whose three-game winning streak ended on the second night of a back-to-back. Lou Williams finished with 21 points and nine assists, and Montrezl Harrell had 18 points. ""Atlanta was better prepared and played harder,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They came in with an intent to win the game. You could feel it through the game."" Atlanta stretched its lead to 16 points, its largest of the game, midway through the fourth quarter. The Clippers weren't done just yet. Harris scored 10 of their next 19 points to close to 118-112. But Dewayne Dedmon dunked and Young hit a 3-pointer that kept the Hawks ahead 123-114. ""He's really been composed over the last couple games,"" Collins said of Young. ""He's made an effort to really make the right play."" The Clippers overcame a 12-point deficit to tie the game five times in the third quarter. But the Hawks closed on a 17-6 run to lead 94-83 going into the fourth. Len scored nine points and 42-year-old Vince Carter drew cheers after connecting on a 3-pointer. The Hawks set the tone on their first basket of the game. Dedmon slammed a one-handed dunk, stopped and stared into the crowd. The Clippers led just once after that by three points. TIP-INS Hawks: Their bench outscored the Clippers' reserves, who lead the NBA in scoring, 51-45. ... They split the season series, having lost 129-117 at home on Nov. 19.

"CLEVELAND --  Larry Nance Jr. wasn't sure the clock would ever run out Tuesday night. The Cavaliers' forward wasn't the only one. Cleveland nearly squandered a 25-point lead in the fourth quarter before holding off Washington's comeback for a 116-113 win over the Wizards. ""We were at like 32 seconds for three minutes, I swear,"" Nance said of the harrowing finish. The Cavaliers seemed to be on their way to an easy victory most of the night. Jordan Clarkson scored 28 points and Cedi Osman had 26. Cleveland matched a season high with 15 3-pointers and led 105-80 with 6:58 remaining. Then the Cavaliers, who hit seven of 16 free throws in the final period, nearly fell apart as Washington's reserves almost pulled out a stunner. The margin was trimmed to nine, but Cleveland still led 115-103 with 42 seconds remaining. Jordan McRae hit two 3-pointers and Tony Brown Jr. had a layup as the Cavs missed three of four from the line. McRae's two foul shots with 18 seconds remaining cut the deficit to three. Osman missed two free throws with 11 seconds left and the Wizards called a timeout to set up a chance to tie the game. Osman stripped the ball from Brown at the 3-point line and Nance dribbled out the clock. Washington's starters were on the bench most of the fourth quarter and coach Scott Brooks kept them there for the last possession. ""They earned the right to win the game,"" he said of his backups. ""These guys earned the right to get us to overtime."" The Cavaliers were relieved to head home with the win. ""Momentum's a scary thing,"" Nance said. ""When another team has momentum it doesn't matter if you put the guys with the best plus-minus on the team in. Once it snowballs and gets rolling, it's hard to stop."" Ante Zizic had 12 points and 12 rebounds. Nance added 13 points with 11 rebounds. The Cavaliers, who defeated Chicago on Sunday, won back-to-back games for the second time this season. Cleveland (11-41) had lost 18 of 19 before beating the Bulls. Bradley Beal scored 31 but Washington lost in Cleveland for the second time this season. The Cavaliers topped the Wizards 116-101 on Dec. 8, a game Cleveland led by 29 points. The other time the Cavs won consecutive games was Nov. 23-24 when they stunned Philadelphia and Houston. Cleveland also broke a nine-game home losing streak and won at Quicken Loans Arena for the first time since beating New York on Dec. 12. Trevor Ariza had 13 points. McRae scored 15 points and Gary Payton II had 11 -- all in the final quarter. McRae was a reserve on Cleveland's 2015-16 team that won the NBA championship. HE SAID IT Beal had a simple theory on why the Wizards played so poorly until the final minutes. ""We probably thought that Cleveland was terrible, and they came out and punched us in the mouth, just like they did last time,"" he said. ""You can't overlook anybody. You've got to respect every team in the league."" THE NEXT STEP Kevin Love will likely participate in contact drills this week. Cleveland coach Larry Drew has been impressed with how the All-Star forward has moved in offensive drills. The Cavaliers are off until hosting Dallas on Saturday, but Drew doesn't anticipate Love will play this week. Love had foot surgery in November. TIP-INS Wizards: C Ian Mahinmi (sprained right thumb) and F Sam Dekker (back spasms) returned after missing one game apiece. Dekker began the season with Cleveland and was traded to Washington on Dec. 8 as part of a three-team deal that included Milwaukee. Cavaliers: Had six players in doubles figures. Collin Sexton scored 12 points and Matthew Dellavedova added 10. ... Sexton fouled Beal while the Wizards' guard was hitting a 3 in the first quarter. Beal completed the four-point play at the line. ... Osman was selected to the World Team for the Rising Stars game that will take place during All-Star weekend.","401071422"
"DETROIT --  The Milwaukee Bucks have been unbeatable after a loss. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 21 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds to help the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 115-105 on Tuesday night, keeping the distinction of being the league's only team without two straight setbacks. ""I love that about this team,"" said Antetokounmpo, who added three steals and two blocks. ""Every game we don't play well, the next game we try from the first minute to set the tone."" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said the feat speaks to the character and the competitiveness of the team. ""Really good teams historically, they usually bounce back after a loss,"" Budenholzer said. ""And, so far this team has been able to do that."" The NBA-leading Bucks improved to 13-0 after losing a game. ""We learn from our mistakes,"" said Bucks reserve Pat Connaughton, who matched a season high with 16 points. ""The unfortunate thing in sports is you tend to learn a lot more from losing than you do winning."" Milwaukee's Brook Lopez scored 12 of his 14 points in the first quarter when Antetokounmpo was limited to three points because he was on the bench for about half the quarter with two fouls. Eric Bledsoe had 20 points and seven assists, Khris Middleton scored 15 points and Tony Snell added 11 points for the Bucks, who have won seven of eight games. Detroit's Reggie Jackson matched a season high with 25 points and Andre Drummond had 20 points and 13 rebounds. Blake Griffin had 18 points, nine assists and seven rebounds for the Pistons, who have lost four of five and dropped to 21-28 overall. Griffin said he has not given up hope the team can make the playoffs. ""It's still within our grasp,"" said Griffin, who insisted he has not asked the Pistons to trade him. The Lopez-led Bucks had an eight-point advantage after the first quarter and built a 13-point lead at halftime. That cushion was big enough against the Pistons, who did not appear to be motivated to potentially rally for the win late in the game. Detroit's Stanley Johnson turned the ball over on a pass toward Reggie Jackson with 2:28 left, and Jackson stood and watched after Bledsoe took the ball near midcourt and went in for a layup. ""We're never trying to give up,"" Lopez said. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee swept the season series against Detroit for the first time in franchise history. Pistons: Owner Tom Gores said he's still hoping Detroit makes the playoffs, adding the franchise will explore all possibilities before the NBA trade deadline next week. ""I have not lost faith in this team,"" Gores said. ""There is something there. We just need some time. Dwane (Casey) just got here."" X-FACTOR Bucks reserve D.J. Wilson, a former Michigan star, scored all nine of his points on 4-of-6 shooting in the second quarter. Wilson's scoring helped Milwaukee build a 62-49 lead at halftime after the Pistons pulled into a 35-all tie. ""That was a critical stretch,"" Budenholzer said. ""We needed somebody to put the ball in the basket, and he did it."" Casey, meanwhile, lamented how poorly his team played late in the first half. ""They turned up the physicality and we didn't meet it in that stretch,"" he said. BIG PLAYMAKER The 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo scored twice and had two assists on 3-pointers instead taking shots of his own in the lane over the final 1:38 of the third after Detroit cut its deficit to four. ""He's a great decision-maker,"" Budenholzer said. ""Those are big momentum swings, going into a quarter."" INJURY REPORT Bucks: Shooting guard Malcolm Brogdon (bruised sternum) and guard Donte DiVincenzo (heel) missed the game. Pistons: Guards Reggie Bullock (left ankle) and Ish Smith (groin) were out with injuries.","401071423"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It's difficult for anyone on the Oklahoma City Thunder roster to steal the spotlight from Paul George and Russell Westbrook. Dennis Schroder managed to do it during a 126-117 comeback win over the Orlando Magic. ""Obviously, Dennis played an incredible second half in every aspect -- defensively, offensively -- and gave us great separation,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. George scored 31 of his 37 points in the first half and Westbrook had his fourth straight triple-double with 23 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists, but Schroder's five-minute run in the fourth quarter pushed Oklahoma City to its sixth straight victory Tuesday night. The backup point guard scored 18 of his 21 points -- including two 3-pointers and a pair of three-point plays -- in a stretch when he hit seven consecutive shots. He outscored Orlando 18-8 by himself during that spurt, helping the Thunder rally from a five-point deficit to a 13-point lead in the process. ""I do the same every night,"" Schroder insisted. ""I try to stay aggressive, look for my shot, look for open teammates and just make the right play. It's not like I'm out there 48 minutes, but it's working out so far."" The Thunder needed a boost after George cooled off considerably in the second half. He was 11 of 16 in the first two quarters, but only 3 of 8 after halftime. ""When you can do that, play with such unselfishness, it opens up things for everybody,"" Donovan said. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 27 points and 11 rebounds. Evan Fournier had 17 points and Aaron Gordon added 16 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Terrence Ross scored 16 off the bench. It was another familiar ending for the Magic, who have lost four straight and seven of eight. They had their chances, rallying from a 15-point third-quarter deficit to lead by five early in the fourth, but couldn't sustain the comeback. ""We lost No. 1 because (Oklahoma City) is good and played well,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""But when you're not going to run back on every single possession -- which takes no talent, by the way -- they're going to make you pay and they made us pay. ""No. 2, we're fouling them in the backcourt when they're in the bonus. It's crazy. It's stupid, losing basketball. And then we decide in the fourth quarter, we're not going to pass the ball to each other. We've got guys dribbling out the shot clock when you've got to move the ball. You're not going to win doing that."" The Thunder squandered a 15-point lead in the third and were down 101-98 in the fourth before Schroder righted the ship. He had a three-point play, a 3-pointer and a 15-foot jumper as Oklahoma City scored 10 straight points to take a 108-101 lead. He added another three-point play and 3-pointer to make it 116-103. Ross knocked down consecutive 3s to help Orlando cut the deficit to 116-111 with four minutes to play, but that was as close as the Magic got. TIP-INS Thunder: George has at least two 3s in 29 straight games. Stephen Curry and James Harden are the only other players in NBA history to do that. ... C Steven Adams sat out with a sore ankle. Magic: Gordon had eight points in the first two minutes, then missed his last six shots of the half. ... Orlando has lost four straight home games and is 12-15 at home. ...

"NEW YORK --  D'Angelo Russell credits Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson for giving him an extra push this season. A night after being benched for the entire fourth quarter during a tough loss at Boston, the Nets point guard stepped up with an impressive second-half performance. Russell scored 24 of his 30 points over the final two quarters, Shabazz Napier had 24 off the bench and the Nets beat the Chicago Bulls 122-117 on Tuesday night for their ninth straight win at home. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 18 points and Joe Harris had 17 for the Nets, who improved to 28-24 and matched last season's win total. ""I give him a lot of credit for the teaching moments,"" Russell said about Atkinson, who wasn't pleased with his guard's rebounding effort from the previous night. ""My knowledge and IQ has really rose to another level just from learning from my mistakes and him breaking it down and us (dissecting) the film together."" The Nets, who played their third straight game without injured key reserve guard Spencer Dinwiddie, have won 13 of 14 at Barclays Center and seven of eight overall. Brooklyn started slow in the first quarter, shooting just 8 for 29 from the field, after losing at Boston on Monday night. The Nets trailed by nine at one point and 54-50 at halftime but turned it around after Russell made three straight baskets during a one-minute stretch that bridged the end of the third quarter and the final period. Zach Levine had 26 points and Jabari Parker added 22 points and nine rebounds for the Bulls, who have lost four straight and 10 of 11. Lauri Markkanen had 18 points and a career-high 19 rebounds, each on the defensive end of the court. ""We need toughness and I think everybody stepped their game up and I am trying to do the same thing,"" Markkanen said. Markkanen scored five straight points late in the fourth to inch the Bulls closer 110-106 with 2:18 left. On the next possession, Parker blocked DeMarre Carroll's driving layup and Russell was able to recover the ball near the halfcourt area after a Chicago defender tried to scoop it up. Russell's hustle play was capped with a nifty pass to a cutting Harris that made it 112-106. ""I thought D'Angelo really managed the game well at the end of the game,"" Atkinson said. ""They're double-teaming him, he's getting it out, he's making the right play."" TIP INS Bulls: Markkanen is the first NBA player to notch 19 rebounds without tallying an offensive board. DeMarcus Cousins was the last to do so when he pulled down 20 rebounds in 2015. Nets: Napier's five 3-pointers matched a career-high. ... Brooklyn's nine-game winning streak at home is the second-longest active winning streak in the league. Toronto has won its last 10 at home. GUARDING THE BALL Russell recorded his league-leading third game this season with at least 30 points, five or more assists and no turnovers. Paul George is up next with two. UP FOR THE CHALLENGE Brooklyn rookie F Rodions Kurucs was selected to the Rising Stars game, which will be held Feb. 15, two nights before the All-Star Game in Charlotte. The Latvian will be play for the World team. He has been a pleasant surprise for the up-and-coming Nets this season. The 20-year-old is the lowest drafted player chosen to this year's game between the top first- and second-year players. Kurucs entered the night averaging 9.4 points off 49.4 percent shooting from the field in 34 games. He will be joined by starting center Jarrett Allen, Brooklyn's first-round pick in the 2017 draft. Allen, who will be on the U.S. squad, is averaging 11.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in 49 games this season. Markkanen will represent the Bulls. He has posted 17.1 points and 7.4 rebounds in 27 games after missing the first 18 to start his second season in the league due to a sprained right elbow.","401071425"
"HOUSTON --  If the drama between Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans is frustrating his teammates, it didn't show in their return to the court Tuesday night. Jahlil Okafor scored 27 points and the short-handed Pelicans overcame a big early deficit to beat the Houston Rockets 121-116 in their first game since Davis' agent said the five-time All-Star wants to be traded. Davis sat out his fifth straight game with a sprained left index finger, but Okafor and Jrue Holiday rallied New Orleans despite 37 points from Houston's James Harden. ""It wasn't no drama to us,"" Okafor said. ""A.D.'s here. He took us all to dinner last night. There's not really any drama for us. I know there's a lot of noise on the outside, but in the locker room we're still all together. We still love A.D. He still loves us. ... So we're all great."" Harden extended his streak of 30-point games to 24, but he had a tough shooting night, making 11 of 32 overall and going 6 for 18 from 3-point range. He had 11 rebounds, six assists and four steals. Houston coach Mike D'Antoni credited Holiday for making things tough on Harden. ""Jrue Holiday is probably one of the best defenders in the league, if not the best,"" he said. ""Obviously he did a heck of a job on him."" Holiday had 19 points, eight assists, six rebounds and a career-high six blocks for New Orleans. ""Obviously beating a team of this caliber and doing it on their home floor is rewarding,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I just think that the guys that we put out there they play extremely hard."" New Orleans used an 8-2 run to make it 114-102 with 3 1/2 minutes left. Holiday had six points for the Pelicans in that span, and Houston missed seven straight shots. The Rockets got going after that, using a 12-4 spurt -- with 10 points from Harden -- to get within 118-114 with 22.4 seconds left. Kenrich Williams missed two free throws after that, but Harden turned the ball over, and Houston opted to foul Tim Frazier. He made one of two free throws to extend the lead to five with 12.1 seconds remaining. Harden was fouled on a 3-pointer and made two of three to cut the lead to three with 6.3 seconds left, but Holiday made two free throws to secure the victory. ""Everything was hard tonight because we weren't stopping them, and when that happens obviously we paid the price,"" D'Antoni said. The Pelicans snapped a three-game skid amid the Davis drama. Davis' agent also said the star big man won't sign an extension with the team, a move that earned Davis a $50,000 fine because the league office said he violated a collectively bargained rule prohibiting players or their representatives from making public trade demands. Davis chatted with teammates while watching the game from the end of the bench. ""That's going to play out the way it plays out,"" Gentry said. ""I don't talk about it very much. I think it's out in the public now, and I think everything that needed to be said has been said."" The Rockets led by as many as 15 early, but the Pelicans used a 13-5 run in the third quarter to get within 83-81 with about four minutes left in the quarter. Okafor had four points in that stretch and Holiday added a 3-pointer. TIP-INS Pelicans: Julius Randle missed his third straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... Darius Miller had 14 points. ... Frazier added 15 points off the bench. Rockets: Holiday is the first guard in NBA history with at least 17 points, six rebounds, seven assists and six blocks in a game. ... Chris Paul had 10 points and nine assists in his second game back after missing 17 with a hamstring injury. ... Kenneth Faried had 19 points and 11 rebounds. ... Eric Gordon scored 17 points and made four 3-pointers. THEY SAID IT Holiday on his career-high six blocks: ""It's my inner Anthony (Davis), man."" HARDEN'S SCORING Tuesday was Harden's 11th straight game with at least 35 points, which is the fifth-longest streak in NBA history. He averaged 43.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 7.6 assists this month. In 14 games in January he scored 610 points, to become the first player to have 600 or more points in a month since Michael Jordan did it in March of 1987.","401071426"
"Gregg Popovich claims his Spurs did not deserve to win then quickly exits the room. (0:32) SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs mobbed Rudy Gay after his game-winning shot against Phoenix, but that celebration got a cold dose of reality once they hit the locker room. Gay hit a 21-foot jumper at the buzzer and the Spurs overcame Devin Booker's 38 points to escape with a 126-124 victory Tuesday night, extending the Suns' losing streak to nine games. ""We were really fortunate to win the game,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I thought that they outplayed us, outcoached us, out-physicaled us, out-executed us. We had no respect for them or for the game. We didn't play with each other. It was a pathetic performance, and Phoenix got robbed."" The Suns lost their previous four games by an average of 23 points and were without top draft pick Deandre Ayton, but the Spurs needed a clutch shot at the buzzer to win. ""It's a win,"" Gay said. ""I'm not happy about how it happened, but we got a win. That's part of being a good team -- you've got to find ways to get wins."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 29 points and 14 rebounds for San Antonio, which is 2-0 on a four-game homestand despite playing without injured DeMar DeRozan. Gay finished with 16 points, five rebounds and five assists. The Suns lost their 11th straight in San Antonio even as Booker matched his season high in points. ""Dropping nine straight and losing three or four to game-winners, you realize that you have to be locked in the whole game,"" Booker said. ""It's not just the final shot."" Phoenix tied this one with 19.6 seconds remaining. Booker stole a pass from Marco Belinelli and fed Josh Jackson for an uncontested dunk to make it 124-all. With time winding down, Gay was isolated and pulled up off the dribble for a jumper over Kelly Oubre Jr. on the left wing as the clock expired to help San Antonio avoid an upset. ""Salute to Rudy for hitting that,"" Oubre said. The Spurs entered allowing 109.7 points per game, 13th in the NBA, but struggled to contain the Suns. Phoenix had six players score in double figures, including 22 points by Jamal Crawford. ""We're just not as physical as we were when we were really playing well,"" said San Antonio point guard Derrick White, who had 15 points. ""We have moments where we're doing the right things but we haven't been consistent with it."" The Suns were 13 for 29 on 3-pointers and shot 60 percent from the field to turn a 12-point deficit in the third quarter into a near victory. San Antonio went on a 14-2 run starting midway through the third in taking a 94-82 lead. Phoenix pulled to 96-95 early in the fourth, 106-105 halfway through the period and 119-118 with two minutes remaining. ""We just weathered the storm,"" Crawford said. ""They threw some haymakers at us and we didn't fold. We showed some growth and continue to push forward. We gave ourselves a chance, that's all you can ask for."" The Spurs finished with seven players in double figures, including every starter. Davis Bertans had 18 points and Belinelli scored 17 off the bench. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix's last win in San Antonio was Feb. 27, 2013, when Jermaine O'Neal scored 22 points off the bench in a 105-101 victory. ... Ayton missed his sixth straight game with a sprained left ankle. Spurs: DeRozan sat out his third consecutive game with a sore left knee.

Aldridge has 17,968 career points, moving him past World B. Free, Calvin Murphy and Lou Hudson and into the top 75 scorers in NBA history. PUT HIM IN, COACHES Bertans was not invited to participate in the 3-point shooting contest during All-Star weekend despite leading the league in 3-point percentage. That confounds his teammates. ""I think he's one of the best 3-point shooters in the league,"" Gay said. ""I don't know why he's not in the 3-point contest."" TAKING A BREAK Phoenix has three days off before playing Atlanta. The Suns seek their first win since Jan. 12. ""At this point everybody's a little banged up,"" Crawford said. ""It may be good to get away from it for a day and then get back to it.""","401071427"
"LOS ANGELES --  Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown decided to experiment with his lineup during Tuesday night's game against the Los Angeles Lakers. If one game is any indication, Brown can consider it a success. The Sixers led throughout and were up by 24 in the second quarter as they rolled to a 121-105 victory over the short-handed Lakers. Joel Embiid scored 28 points and grabbed 11 rebounds from his usual spot in the middle, but Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons thrived in new roles. Butler had 20 points and six assists in his first game at point guard, and Simmons scored 19 while playing the stretch 4 -- power forward with the range of a shooting guard. ""I think Jimmy did an amazing job getting everyone open. We still need to work on stuff to get better, but it was an amazing start,"" said Embiid, who had his NBA-leading 34th game with at least 20 points and 10 boards. Brown said he changed the lineup because he wanted to learn more about his team with the trade deadline less than two weeks away and with an eye toward possible matchups in the playoffs. ""There were some good things that came out of it,"" Brown said. ""These are things to help us win and it gives us a greater level of knowledge about how we need to grow our team."" Brandon Ingram had a career-high 36 points for the Lakers, who were missing Kyle Kuzma (hip) along with LeBron James and Lonzo Ball. Butler was back after missing three games due to a sprained wrist. He got off to a quick start with nine points in the first quarter as Philadelphia ran off 12 straight points to take control early. The Sixers extended their lead to 38-17 late in the first and were up 39-20 at the end of the period as they went 15 of 27 from the field and forced eight turnovers. ""It felt good playing the point,"" Butler said. ""It's a different look. We've got so many guys that do so many things well that it allows us to get to the basket more."" Simmons, who had 11 points in the first 12 minutes, said he liked the new-look lineup because he felt less pressure. A 3-pointer by Landry Shamet gave Philadelphia a 48-24 advantage with 8:14 remaining in the second before Los Angeles scored 16 straight points to get within eight. Ingram scored nine of his 15 points in the quarter during that run. The Sixers answered with a pair of 3-pointers by Wilson Chandler and went into halftime with a 64-53 advantage. The Lakers got to 80-71 midway through the third quarter on a pair of free throws by Ivan Zubac, but Shamet and Embiid hit 3s to put Philadelphia's lead back in double digits. ""We definitely gave them momentum at the start. We fought back but they pretty much had a rhythm throughout the game,"" Ingram said. The Sixers went up by 19 in the second half. The only scary moment for them came early in the fourth quarter when Embiid appeared to hurt his back falling down on an alley-oop attempt. He returned later in the game and said he was fine. TIP-INS 76ers: Mike Muscala added 17 points off the bench. ... Embiid is tied with Utah's Rudy Gobert for the league lead in double-doubles with 41. ... Embiid also picked up his third flagrant foul of the season during the third quarter. ... It was the fourth straight game Philadelphia scored 30 points or more in the first quarter. The 76ers are averaging 30.7 points in the opening 12 minutes, second in the league to Golden State. ... The Sixers had 11 steals in the first half, their most in a half since Jan. 27, 2017, vs. Houston. Lakers: JaVale McGee had 17 points and 14 rebounds. ... Rajon Rondo had 14 assists and has 38 in three games since returning from a finger injury. ... Tyson Chandler, rested by coach Luke Walton in the previous game, had no points in four minutes.

"BOSTON --  Jaylen Brown had 24 points and 10 rebounds, Jayson Tatum scored 20 points, and the Boston Celtics rolled over the Charlotte Hornets 126-94 on Wednesday night despite Kyrie Irving's absence. Terry Rozier had 17 points and tied a career high with 10 assists in place of Irving, who missed his second straight game with a left hip strain. Marcus Morris scored 15 points, Al Horford had 14 and Gordon Hayward 12 for the Celtics, who won for the seventh time in eight games. Kemba Walker had 21 points to lead Charlotte, well short of the 43 he scored in a 117-112 home win over Boston on Nov. 19. Malik Monk scored 16 points, Nicolas Batum added 13 and Marvin Williams 10 in Charlotte's third loss in five games. Morris knocked down a 3-pointer from the right wing with 6:49 left in the third period to put Boston ahead 76-69 and started a 25-6 quarter-ending run. The Celtics led 98-75 after three and ran the lead up to 35 during the fourth. TIP-INS Hornets: After playing 19 minutes in Monday's win against the Knicks, PG Tony Parker sat to rest his sore right ankle. Rookie two-way G Joe Chealey was active for the first time in his NBA career. ... Coach James Borrego said C Cody Zeller, out since Dec. 31 while recovering from right hand surgery, is ""about a week away"" from returning. Celtics: Irving, who last week earned his sixth All-Star selection in eight seasons, missed his second straight game with an injury the team believes he suffered during Saturday's loss to Golden State. ""Hopefully he'll be available Friday (against the Knicks). If not, Sunday,"" coach Brad Stevens said. Boston improved to 6-2 without Irving this season. RISING RUMORS Tatum will play for Team USA in the Rising Stars game for a second straight season during All-Star weekend in Charlotte. The 20-year-old Celtics forward isn't as certain where he'll play after that with the NBA's trade deadline looming on Feb 7. ""I mean, it's good to be wanted,"" Tatum said about his name popping up in trade rumors surrounding New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis, whose agent publicly requested a trade Monday. ""I'm not a free agent. I don't have any control. I can control what I can control. Just go out there and play."" BEAT L.A. (AGAIN) With the Patriots set to face the Rams in Super Bowl LIII on Sunday, the Celtics were gifted Pats-themed T-shirts saying ""Beat LA"" from New England wide receiver Julian Edelman. The rally cry, which originates from the Celtics' rivalry with the Lakers, was also adopted by Red Sox fans during this year's World Series against the Dodgers.","401071429"
"MIAMI --  The Chicago Bulls are mired toward the bottom of the NBA standings and know the postseason isn't going to include them. That being said, there's no way coach Jim Boylen is going to let them merely play out the string as though the last 30 games are meaningless. Instead, he's challenging them. And on Wednesday night, they listened. Bobby Portis scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half, Wayne Selden added 20 and the Bulls ran away after halftime to beat the Miami Heat 105-89 -- getting a win to finish off the second-worst January in franchise history. ""I just think you make it a competitive experience,"" said Boylen, whose team went 2-13 this month. ""Look, this game today is what the league's about. You get in late after a competitive game and now you're playing at the Miami Heat, a great franchise. Now, a competitive person takes that challenge."" Lauri Markkanen had 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Bulls, who went 1-13 in January 2001 for their worst first month of the calendar year. Kris Dunn scored 14 and Robin Lopez added 13 for Chicago, which shot 51 percent. That, combined with a 50 percent showing at Brooklyn on Tuesday night, marked the first time the Bulls have made at least half their shots in consecutive games since October. ""We knew we've got a locker room with no superstars in here,"" Selden said. ""We didn't have any superstars out there tonight, but we had a whole bunch of guys that wanted to fight and we have some dogs in here."" Miami -- now without Derrick Jones and Goran Dragic -- held out Dwyane Wade with right knee soreness. Chicago was without Zach LaVine because of a sprained right ankle. Tyler Johnson scored 15 points for Miami, which got 14 from Justise Winslow and 13 apiece from Bam Adebayo and Wayne Ellington. The Heat shot 38 percent, including 12 of 42 from 3-point range. ""You could just feel missed shots sapped some of our energy and resolve at the other end,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Heat fell to 11-14 at home -- and the Bulls, who snapped a four-game slide, moved to 7-20 on the road. Portis had 15 points in the fourth, while Miami's entire roster managed 21 in the final 12 minutes. The Bulls led by 10 after the first quarter, took a two-point lead into halftime and then found themselves trailing by six early in the third. But they answered with an 18-5 run over the next five minutes, and led by three when Dion Waiters tried a 3-pointer with 1:38 left for the tie. It missed, and with that the Bulls were off and running. Chicago finished the quarter on a 7-0 run, led by 10 going into the fourth and kept the lead the rest of the way.

The official reason for him not playing is listed as ""trade pending."" ... Chicago has reached 100 points in 14 consecutive games, the team's longest streak since the 1991-92 season.

"Enes Kanter explains his smooch of the Knicks logo as his way of showing his appreciation to the fans and the city of New York for their support. (0:39) NEW YORK --  Dirk Nowitzki has been coming to Madison Square Garden for about two decades, scoring better there than at any road arena. If this was the last visit, he ended with a good one. Nowitzki scored a season-high 14 points, Luka Doncic warmed up after an airball on his first shot in the arena to score 16, and the Dallas Mavericks routed the New York Knicks 114-90 on Wednesday night. Dennis Smith Jr. had his second career triple-double, and Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 19 points, but most of the focus was on the team's star rookie and 21-year veteran, who may be in his final season. ""I always enjoyed playing here,"" Nowitzki said. ""If it was my last time it was definitely one of my most favorite places to play."" The 19-year-old Doncic also grabbed eight rebounds and made two 3-pointers, both in the second half after the game was long secured. ""It was great. For sure we needed that win. We were struggling on the road,"" Doncic said. ""It was great to play here and I'm looking forward to playing a lot of years here."" He shot airballs on two of his first four attempts and wasn't nearly as good as in his previous game, when he scored a season-high 35 points Sunday against Toronto, becoming the first teenager in NBA history with multiple triple-doubles. Then again, he didn't need to do nearly as much against the team with the NBA's worst record. The Knicks (10-40) lost their 11th in a row, though at least gave home fans something to cheer by giving Enes Kanter some playing time. They also cheered the 40-year-old Nowitzki when he walked toward the table to check in late in the first quarter, and stood and cheered when he got into the game. Nowitzki made his first three shots for nine points in seven minutes, then didn't come back on again until the fourth quarter, when he nailed another 3. He was bummed in Boston, when he couldn't reward the fans with a basket as they desperately cheered for him to knock one in during the final minutes. But after a solid warmup, he felt good about his chances at MSG, where he came in averaging 24.9 points in 17 games, his highest average in a road arena. ""I knew if I get a chance I was going to step into some,"" Nowitzki said. Kevin Knox scored 17 points and Trey Burke had 16 for the Knicks, while Kanter had five points in nine minutes. Fans began chanting ""We want Kanter! We want Kanter!"" in the third quarter. He waved from the bench and clapped along, then was actually inserted into the game a few minutes later, ending the former starting center's streak of four straight games where he didn't play. ""He just yelled out my name and I was like `Yo, really?"" Kanter said, referring to coach David Fizdale. ""I even looked around like, is he serious? And then I got up and the fans starting clapping and I thought this is really happening."" He kissed the Knicks logo at center court when he walked onto the floor. Kanter's first shot was an airball before he got on the board with a dunk. TIP-INS Mavericks: Smith finished with 13 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. ... Wesley Matthews scored 17 points. Knicks: The Knicks finished 1-12 in January. They were 2-12 in December. ... Tim Hardaway Jr. was 2 for 11 for six points. COACH DIRK Nowitzki will be the honorary coach of the World team in the Rising Stars Challenge, adding to his busy All-Star weekend in Charlotte in which he will also take part in the 3-point contest. Asked about playing for Nowitzki, Doncic joked that he was going to try to change teams. ""I told him he's got to play hard or I'm going to sub him out,"" Nowitzki said. ""I'm going to be tough on him. I'm going to teach him a lesson."" KANTER'S CHANCE Fizdale has made it clear he's focused on playing young big men such as Noah Vonleh and rookie Mitchell Robinson, wasn't happy with them Wednesday so turned back to Kanter. ""I didn't feel the bigs were playing at the level that I want them to play at. I don't want those minutes to feel like entitlement,"" Fizdale said. ""Like I've told Enes, any chance I could get to squeeze you in there within the framework of what we're trying to do with the young guys, I'm going to do it. I want to be upfront and stick with that.""","401071431"
"WASHINGTON --  Although consistency continues to elude them, the Washington Wizards have been playing winning basketball for a solid month and have a reasonable chance of sneaking into the playoffs. The Indiana Pacers are quickly heading in the opposite direction. Bradley Beal scored 25 points, Jeff Green added 23 to lead another productive night from Washington's bench, and the Wizards beat the reeling Pacers 107-89 on Wednesday night. Green had 16 points in the first half to help spell Beal, who came in second in the NBA in minutes at 37.2 per game, and the Wizards' reserves scored 58 points. Washington's second unit also led a fourth-quarter rally that just fell short against Cleveland a night earlier. ""In order to make the playoffs, be in the playoffs, succeed in the playoffs, you've got to have a good bench,"" Beal said. ""They did an excellent job the last two nights of carrying us, pretty much."" Thaddeus Young scored 13 points for the Pacers. They are 0-3 since a victory over Toronto in which leading scorer Victor Oladipo suffered a season-ending knee injury -- their first three-game skid of the season. ""It's just low energy right now. We've kind of lost our way here, and we've got to find it. Vic is not coming back. We've got to move past that and not look at what we don't have and focus on what we do have,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""But we've got to get more energy in the game. Defensively, we're not stopping anybody."" Indiana dropped to fourth place in the Eastern Conference, a half-game behind Philadelphia and a half-game ahead of fifth-place Boston. The Pacers could easily fall further if McMillan can't find a way to compensate for the absence of Oladipo, who averaged 18.8 points per game. The Pacers were held to a season low in points and lacked a go-to scorer, with Bojan Bogdanovic, Doug McDermott and TJ Leaf chipping in 12 apiece. ""We've just got to play defense, and then offense will come. Defense gets us into transition and into what we need to do as a team. We're getting stuck in half-court sets, and teams are locking in on that,"" Young said. ""At the end of the day, even when Vic went out early in the season, we were still playing defense, we were still locking down."" The Wizards never trailed after a 10-0 run in the first quarter that put them ahead 24-18. Washington pushed its lead to 22 points in the third quarter. Indiana briefly cut it to 10 but never got closer. Chasson Randle matched his career high with 13 points for Washington, and Jordan McRae scored 12 in a season-high 26 minutes. SECOND TIME'S THE CHARM The Wizards, who went 8-6 in January, continued an odd trend in back-to-back games. They are 7-2 on the back end but 1-8 in the first game. ""I guess that's kind of a good thing, but it's not necessarily a good thing. It's good that we're able to win on the second night. We've got to win on the first night,"" Beal said. ""It's always a good thing to be able to see positive mindsets, have amnesia about the last game, come out tonight and take care of business, but we've got to win on the road. ... I looked at our road record the other day (6-20). It's atrocious."" PORTER HURT AGAIN The Wizards, already missing John Wall, Dwight Howard and Markieff Morris, had another injury when Otto Porter Jr. landed awkwardly after a rebound early in the third quarter. He was diagnosed with a sprained left big toe and did not return. ""Hopefully it's only a day,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""We've got a couple days off before our next game so hopefully he responds well the next couple days of treatment."" Porter missed 10 games earlier this season with a knee injury. TIP-INS Pacers: McMillan gave two-way player Edmond Sumner his second career start. Sumner committed three quick fouls and finished with seven points in 22 minutes. ""The challenge is just getting familiar with our guys,"" Sumner said. ... The Pacers fell to 7-7 overall without Oladipo this season. Wizards: Brooks said the Cleveland loss was the first time ""in probably over a month"" that he'd had to talk to his team about its lack of effort. Coincidentally or not, it's been just over a month since Washington's highest-paid player, Wall, was last in the lineup. Wall, who was never fully healthy this season, last played on Dec. 26 and underwent season-ending surgery on his left heel on Jan. 8. ... Wall signed autographs at halftime, his left knee resting on a scooter and his foot in a plastic boot. ... Washington improved to 11-8 without Wall after going 11-21 with him. ... Morris, out since Dec. 28 with a neck injury, signed autographs and took selfies with fans before the game.","401071432"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Foul trouble forced Karl-Anthony Towns to watch much of the first three quarters from the bench. Luckily for the Minnesota Timberwolves, the star center was available -- and in the right spot -- in overtime. Towns hit a buzzer-beating desperation shot in overtime to lift Minnesota over the Memphis Grizzlies, 99-97 on Wednesday night. Memphis led twice during overtime, but Towns helped the Timberwolves close out their fourth win in a row. On the final possession, Andrew Wiggins ran the clock down to six seconds before shooting a pull-up 3. The rebound fell to the right side, where Towns grabbed it, dribbled once and floated up a shot as he faded toward the corner. The ball went in, and Towns tossed up his hands before getting mobbed by teammates. ""The basketball gods weren't treating me well, but I stuck with it,"" Towns said. ""I was saying, `All right, they owe me one. The gods owe me one and the next chance I get, I'm going to make it.""

"Alvin Gentry says he has no idea who's in the Pelicans' pregame video and wasn't paying attention to Anthony Davis leaving the bench in the fourth quarter. (0:55) NEW ORLEANS --  The generally unselfish, fundamentally sound and versatile Nikola Jokic did precisely what Denver Nuggets coach Mike Malone wanted with the game in the balance. He imposed his will with a pair of powerful, driving reverse layups that prevented the undermanned but scrappy Pelicans from pulling off a second straight victory over a contending team. Jokic finished with 20 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists for his eighth triple-double this season and also blocked two shots to lead the Nuggets past the Pelicans, 105-99 on Wednesday night. ""Everybody knows where the ball is going and Nikola Jokic is out closer -- and that's what you want from your franchise player, your All-Star, your MVP, whatever you want to call him -- down the stretch, give him the ball and let him make plays,"" Malone said. ""He wants it. He has the confidence and he's been delivering, which is the best thing about it."" Malik Beasley scored 22 points, and Monte Morris added 20 to help the Northwest Division-leading Nuggets win their fourth straight. Kenrich Williams hit five of nine 3-point shots and scored a career-high 21 for the scrappy Pelicans. For the second night in a row, they played without four usual starters and a top reserve. Their only available starter, Jrue Holiday, had 22 points, including a step-back, straight-on 3 that cut Denver's lead to 100-99 with 1:32 left. That's when Jokic responded with reverse layups while guarded by Jahlil Okafor to make it 104-99 with 42 seconds left. ""If they trust me, I'm going to try my best to score,"" Jokic said. ""I feel really confident out there."" After trailing 56-53 at halftime, Denver opened the third quarter with a 13-2 run during which Will Barton scored all eight of his points on three driving layups -- each while being fouled. But while the Nuggets led for good after that and went up by as many as 11 points, the Pelicans kept the gap in single digits for most of the second half as they attempted to build on their stunning victory at Houston on Tuesday night. ""You can see what kind of player Jokic is. When they needed baskets, they went to him,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They've got so many shooters around him that it's hard to then go get the ball out of his hands because he's such a great passer also. ""I was proud of the way our guys played. I thought they competed like crazy,"" Gentry added. ""That's all we can do right now. Obviously, we're a little short-handed."" TIP-INS Nuggets:  Guard Jamal Murray missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. Malone said Murray is ""feeling better"" but unsure if he'll return next game. ... Former Louisiana Tech star Paul Millsap had 13 points and eight rebounds ... The Nuggets have held opponents to fewer than 100 points in 17 games this season. Pelicans: For the second straight game, New Orleans was without five prominent players: forward Anthony Davis (sprained left index finger), forward Julius Randle (right ankle sprain), guard Elfrid Payton (right ankle sprain), forward Nikola Mirotic (right calf strain) and guard E'Twaun Moore (rest). ... Darius Miller hit four 3-pointers and finished with 15 points, while Okafor had 14 points. MOVING ON The Pelicans edited their usual pregame video shown on the large center scoreboard just before tip-off. Davis, their five-time All-Star who publicly requested a trade through his agent Monday, was conspicuously absent from the video. He was present at the game, however, sitting on the end of the bench in street clothes. YOUTH MOVEMENT Beasley, a third-year pro out of Florida State, reached 20 points for the sixth time this season after never doing it last season. Morris, meanwhile, complemented his scoring with seven assists, seven rebounds and no turnovers in just his second start this season. ""He did a great job. He knows his role -- score when he has to and facilitate,"" Beasley said of Morris. ""He's just a smart player.""","401071434"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Harry Giles carried Sacramento's offense for most of the third quarter, following a pattern set one period earlier by teammate Marvin Bagley III. The young duo might represent the future of the Kings, but both one-and-done Duke products are just beginning to blossom. Giles scored 12 of his season-high 20 points in the third quarter, Bagley added 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Sacramento romped past the Atlanta Hawks 135-113 behind its two prized rookies Wednesday night. ""That was just a big boost tonight,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""Marvin, without a doubt in my mind, had his best game as an NBA player and same thing for Harry. There was enough to go around for everybody and a lot of positive things."" Giles and Bagley have spent the majority of the season as part of Sacramento's second unit, and they came off the bench again to lead the Kings to their second lopsided win over the Hawks. Bagley, the No. 2 pick in last year's draft who made his first career start on Jan. 22, had 13 points in the first half when Sacramento rallied from 10 down to go up 67-53 at halftime. Bagley also scored on a reverse dunk early in the fourth quarter to bring the crowd to its feet. After the game, Bagley smiled when asked about the potential he and Giles bring to the Kings. ""He had a behind-the-back pass that I didn't even see coming,"" Bagley said. ""I like playing with Harry because he can pass the ball very well, he can dribble, he can rebound, score. He can do it all."" Giles, who missed last season mending from knee surgery, had his most dominant stretch in the third. He had a hand in four straight baskets with a pair of short hook shots, an assist and an offensive rebound that led to a 3-pointer by Bogdan Bogdanovic. Giles later threw down an emphatic dunk that put Sacramento ahead 105-77. ""We're going through the same journey. We come from similar backgrounds, too, so it's easy to kind of feed off each other,"" Giles said. ""We want to see each other do good but help each other at the same time."" Their emergence was particularly important for the Kings on a night when De'Aaron Fox struggled with his shot most of the game. The second-year point guard was scoreless in the first quarter and finished 4 of 10 from the floor. Fox had a rough night overall. He was initially credited with a steal that would have extended his streak to 20 consecutive games with at least one before a scoring change took it away. ""We didn't get in a stance and play with a lot of physicality the first 4-5 minutes,"" Joerger said. ""The bench came in, did a fantastic job and that energy gets contagious."" Bogdanovic had 16 points and seven assists for the Kings, who pulled away in the third thanks to Giles. Buddy Hield scored 18 and Nemanja Bjelica added 12 points and eight rebounds. Trae Young had 23 points with eight assists for Atlanta, which has lost four of six. The Hawks, beaten by the Kings 146-115 on Nov. 1, trailed by 29 and committed 21 turnovers. ""(The Kings) just for some reason have our number pretty good,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""We didn't have the energy or the effort to play a team like this tonight."" ODDS AND ENDS The Kings have won five consecutive home games for the first time since moving into the Golden1 Center three years ago. It is the franchise's longest run since 2007-08. . Bagley's double-double was his seventh this season. BACK-TO-BACK BLUES Atlanta fell to 1-4 in the second half of back-to-backs. The Hawks lost 123-118 to the Clippers in Los Angeles on Tuesday. ""I think it was more about a lack of effort than anything,"" Atlanta's John Collins said. ""But those guys were definitely playing harder. They had a little bit more energy in the game."" TIP-INS Hawks: Young made four 3s and needs four to break the Atlanta rookie record of 82 set by Salim Stoudamire in 2005-06. Kevin Huerter is close behind Young with 78. ... Tyler Dorsey was held out with a knee injury. ... Vince Carter received a loud ovation when he entered in the second quarter. Carter spent last season with the Kings.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  On a night in which they were without starting center Jusuf Nurkic, everything else went right for the Portland Trail Blazers. Damian Lillard had 36 points and 11 assists to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 132-105 win over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. Lillard's backcourt mate CJ McCollum was excellent as well, scoring 30 points in the win. Donovan Mitchell had 22 points to lead Utah. McCollum, only one game removed from his first career triple-double, had plenty of magic left in his bag. The Blazers guard made all nine of his shots in the first quarter and had 20 by the end of the period. Even when he wasn't shooting, he was still scoring. An attempted lob pass from McCollum to Blazers center Meyers Leonard went in the basket anyway. ""He's a magician out there, so you never know,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said when asked if it looked like a pass from his angle. In the eyes of Leonard, who finished with 16 points and six rebounds in place of the injured Nurkic, there was no doubt McCollum intended to pass. But it didn't matter. ""It was absolutely a pass,"" Leonard said. ""But I guess the basketball gods knew he was playing so well that it had to go in."" ""That's when you know you hot,"" LIllard said. McCollum didn't miss a shot until he clanked a free-throw with 9:02 left in the second quarter and didn't miss a field goal until later in the period. Portland put up 45 points in the first quarter and 74 in the half, which put the Jazz in a rough position. ""We just didn't execute the way we want to defensively,"" Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said of his team's performance. ""It's the same team and the same schemes. I thought we should have added more pressure but obviously we didn't come out with that pressure. That's on us."" Even when things went right for the Jazz, they went sour almost immediately. Perhaps nothing exemplified that like a steal and dunk by Donovan Mitchell in the second quarter that ended with the ball hitting a trailing Ricky Rubio in the face. After the Jazz cut the Blazers lead that had once been at 27 down to 10 with 7:57 left in the third quarter, the Blazers put the game away scoring the next 17 points. Lillard was only two rebounds shy of his first career triple-double but was pulled with about six minutes left and the game's result already wrapped up. ""I didn't want to chase it,"" Lillard said. ""Coach left me out there a little bit to see if I can go get a few rebounds and do it. After a few minutes I came to the side and was like, man just take me out. I don't want to be out here hunting it this bad."" With the win, the Blazers tied the season series with the Jazz at 2-2. TIP-INS Jazz: Since Dec. 15, the Utah Jazz have had the best defense in the NBA and they have the second-best in the defense overall. The Jazz improvement on defense has seen them rise in the standings and head coach Quin Snyder believes there were a lot of factors that contributed to the improvement. While the NBA has jumped in pace, averaging two more possessions per game league wide, Snyder believes the pace wasn't a determining factor in their slow start defensively. ""It was more stylistic and some of it was schedule,"" Snyder said. ""Some of it was the team kind of remembering on a little deeper level their identity. We had to make a couple of adjustments. Less so based on pace and more so based on certain personnel situations and how we can best utilize our players. Often times you have to see that and feel it not just as a coach but as a player. To commit to it on a deeper level you have to believe in it."" Trail Blazers: The Blazers and Jazz played on Wednesday night for the 4th time since December 21. With all of the games against the same team in such a short period of time, Blazers head coach Terry Stotts said it's somewhat similar to a playoff setting. ""A little bit,"" Stotts said when asked if it was at all like a playoff matchup. ""I talked to the team during shoot around today like, we should know some of these calls when they're going through their sets. We should know these calls by now. Granted it's not as compact amount of time in a playoff series but there is a degree that you know that team a little bit better than you would if you played them once a month.""","401071436"
"DETROIT --  Free throws have dogged Andre Drummond throughout his NBA career, so when he stepped to the line with a two-point lead and 3.3 seconds remaining, Detroit's victory was far from certain. Drummond then calmly made both shots to seal the game for the Pistons. ""Closing it out with a rebound and getting those two free throws -- is huge,"" Drummond said. ""Got the win, so that's really good."" Drummond had 24 points and 20 rebounds, and the Pistons rallied from a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the short-handed Dallas Mavericks 93-89 on Thursday night. Before the game, the Mavericks traded Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews to the New York Knicks in a seven-player deal . Dallas acquired injured star Kristaps Porzingis and others, but the Mavericks didn't have the players from the trade yet, and they were significantly undermanned for this game. In addition to the players they dealt, the Mavericks also were without star rookie Luka Doncic, who sat out with left ankle soreness. ""It affects it, but this is the NBA. These things happen, and it's next man up,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""You play with what you got. I'm proud of the way we competed. I'm disappointed we couldn't quite get over the hump. Our guys certainly played well enough to get the win."" Detroit had its problems with the depleted Mavericks, falling behind by 14 in the first half. The Pistons were down 74-65 in the fourth before going on a 14-4 run. The game was close the rest of the way. ""I'm totally disappointed in our approach. We have everything to play for, but looked down at the other bench and saw a lot of guys who don't play very often,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""If you don't play with heart and grit, you can't win in this league, and especially not in Detroit. When I grew up in this game, the Pistons stood for grit, grime and hard work."" On this night, the Pistons' belated surge was enough to win. Up by three, Detroit fouled Jalen Brunson with 5.4 seconds left. Brunson made the first free throw and missed the second, and Drummond came up with the rebound and was fouled. Drummond shot 38 percent on free throws through his first five seasons. He improved last season, when he shot 61 percent, and he's at 54 percent this season after finishing Thursday's game in clutch fashion. MILESTONES Blake Griffin had 24 points for Detroit and finished with 445 in January, the highest-scoring month in team history. The previous record was held by Isiah Thomas, who had 442 points in March 1983. Griffin was announced as an All-Star reserve Thursday, but like Casey, he wasn't pleased with his team's overall showing. ""We talked after the game about how we won the game, but we can't be happy about that performance,"" Griffin said. ""We have to work tomorrow like we lost this game, because we didn't play well. We have to fix this ourselves. No one else is going to provide us with energy."" Drummond passed Bill Laimbeer to become the Pistons' career leader in offensive rebounds with 2,431. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas fell to 1-8 in the second half of back-to-backs. Pistons: Reggie Jackson had 17 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. ... The Pistons went 9 of 33 from 3-point range, ending a franchise-record streak of 11 games with at least 10 3s.","401071437"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  After making his first All-Star team earlier in the day, Nikola Vucevic delivered another solid performance for the Orlando Magic. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers are struggling without their own All-Star as Victor Oladipo recovers from knee surgery. Terrence Ross scored 13 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, Vucevic added 17 points and 10 rebounds, and the Magic beat Indiana 107-100 on Thursday night to hand the Pacers their fourth straight loss. ""When you lose your best player,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said, ""your world changes."" D.J. Augustin scored 20 points for the Magic, including nine straight free throws in the final 1:26. Orlando broke a four-game losing streak and snapped an eight-game skid against Indiana. Myles Turner had 27 points and seven rebounds for the Pacers, who haven't won since Oladipo went down during a victory against Toronto on Jan. 23. It was their first loss at Orlando in almost five years. ""I thought we played harder than in the previous games,"" said Darren Collison, who had 16 points and 10 assists. ""I thought we got back to ourselves tonight and we made up for missing some open shots. But we still had some inexcusable mental lapses down the stretch, including me. We have to figure out a way to get out of this slump."" The long-term loss of Oladipo and the short-term loss of Tyreke Evans were obviously weighing on the Pacers. ""You're talking about something you have developed over the course of a year and a half and all of a sudden, that piece is missing,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""We're not panicking, even though it seems like everybody else is."" Ross came off the bench and shot 11 of 18, including five 3-pointers. He made three steals in the fourth quarter. Vucevic scored six points while the Magic were taking an 11-0 lead. The Pacers erased that deficit quickly, but never went ahead until Collison drove for a layup and three-point play with 9:56 left in the third quarter. That came during a 17-4 run in which Turner scored 10 points, lifting Indiana to a 65-57 lead, its largest of the game. Ross converted two straight steals into points to pull Orlando back in front early in the fourth, and Vucevic's basket put the Magic ahead for good at 91-89 with 5:08 left. Augustin followed with a 3-pointer and clinched the victory for Orlando at the foul line. HONORED Vucevic was selected Thursday to his first All-Star Game in his eighth NBA season. He was chosen as an Eastern Conference reserve, becoming the Magic's first All-Star since Dwight Howard in 2012. ""This is really an emotional night for me,"" Vucevic said. ""It's hard to describe when you put so much work into it for so many years and then it finally pays off. That is really satisfying. My teammates and coaches share just as much credit for this."" Vucevic is averaging 20.6 points and 12 rebounds per game. ""He does it every single night, no matter what,"" Augustin said. ""That's why he's an All-Star. A lot of guys can't do that every night."" STILL THE ONE Oladipo was picked as an All-Star reserve even though he won't be able to play in the game. ""I talked to some coaches and they basically said they were going to vote the right way, and the right way was they felt he was an All-Star and they kept their word,"" McMillan said.

The Bucks stayed atop the NBA, 1 1/2 games ahead of the Raptors (37-16) in the Eastern Conference. ""It was a great playoff atmosphere, a very good test for us,"" Milwaukee center Brook Lopez said. The victory ensures the Bucks will have the best winning percentage in the East through Feb. 3, meaning Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer will represent the conference at next month's NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It's a great honor,"" Budenholzer said. ""It says a lot about our team. The players are the ones who put the coaching staff in that position. I'm incredibly grateful to our entire roster."" Milwaukee, which has won eight of nine, had not won the season series against Toronto since 2012-13. ""We came in here and played our style of ball,"" Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon said.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs relied on LaMarcus Aldridge until they were able to put things together against a sneaky zone defense from the Brooklyn Nets. Leaning on Aldridge has worked out pretty well this season. Derrick White scored a career-high 26 points, Aldridge had 20 and the Spurs rallied in the fourth quarter to beat Brooklyn 117-114 on Thursday night, their 16th straight win at home over the Nets. White added six assists, including four in the second half as San Antonio improved to 3-0 on its four-game homestand. ""He's working hard,"" Aldridge said of White. ""He helps this team get better. He's making the right reads, he's growing offensively (and) he's getting to the basket. I think he's that difference maker right now."" Aldridge, fresh off his seventh All-Star selection, made a critical three-point play in the final minute and had 13 rebounds. ""He's had a great season and really kept us together when we were still learning,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""During the tough times when we were really discombobulated, he's been a beast all season. It's a good reward for him to make the All-Star team. He deserves it."" DeMar DeRozan added 15 points and 10 rebounds in his return from a three-game absence because of a sore left knee. After failing to make the All-Star Game as a reserve, D'Angelo Russell pressed his case to replace injured selection Victor Oladipo. Russell had 25 points, nine assists and four turnovers in 33 minutes for Brooklyn. The Nets eclipsed 100 points for the 12th straight game even without Spencer Dinwiddie, their third-leading scorer. ""They're not going to beat themselves,"" Russell said of the Spurs. ""So, when you go to an away game, you've got to come with your hard hat on and be ready to take that win."" Brooklyn shot 47 percent from the field and had 30 assists, which was four off its season high. Joe Harris and DeMarre Carroll had 18 points each for the Nets. Brooklyn, which had won seven of eight coming in, erased a 12-point deficit in the first half and led 97-90 with eight minutes remaining. The Nets used a zone defense off their own made shots and played man-to-man when they missed. The strategy threw the Spurs off-kilter. ""Zones are tough for everybody in the NBA,"" Popovich said. ""With the short clock, people just sort of stop. It's a good move. They've been really successful at it. They've used it quite a bit and it's really helped them out. There were times it gave us trouble, at times we had good shots and missed them, but it keeps you on your toes and keeps you off balance. It's a good tactic by coach (Kenny) Atkinson."" San Antonio rallied in the fourth quarter, when it started finding some seams in the zone. ""It was one of them nights where we couldn't make nothing to save our lives,"" DeRozan said. ""We just kept pushing, kept fighting and it turned for us."" Aldridge's three-point play after a foul on his own follow-up shot put the Spurs ahead 115-111 with 51.1 seconds remaining. Aldridge added two free throws with 3.6 seconds left, and Shabazz Napier missed a 26-footer at the buzzer that would have tied the game. ""Pop went zone,"" Atkinson said of the last shot. ""It's a good move by him. We obviously had a man-to-man play. Good job by him.""

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Warriors coach Steve Kerr figured it would be a tough challenge for DeMarcus Cousins to keep up with Joel Embiid at this stage, given Cousins has just returned from almost a yearlong absence recovering from a serious Achilles tendon injury. Embiid had 26 points and 20 rebounds to spoil Cousins' home debut with the Warriors, and the Philadelphia 76ers snapped Golden State's NBA-best 11-game winning streak with a 113-104 victory Thursday night. Philadelphia hadn't won a game in the series in nearly six years. Ben Simmons also scored 26 points and JJ Redick added 15 points for the Sixers, who grabbed 16 offensive rebounds to give them 10 or more in five straight games and 11 of 15. ""It's a fantastic win.

""To do it on the road, to do it in front of their fans against a team that is this good and had won that many in a row, it is a good night."" Embiid missed all five of his 3s and committed eight turnovers but also had five assists and two steals. ""I wanted that matchup,"" Cousins said. Stephen Curry scored 41 points with 10 3-pointers to go with six assists, and Cousins contributed seven points, six rebounds and six assists. Kevin Durant hit a 3-pointer with 4:52 remaining to trim the deficit to 102-96, but Draymond Green fouled moments later and received a technical for arguing. Durant finished with 25 points on 11-for-24 shooting but missed seven of his eight 3-point tries. Curry's baseline 3 with 2:46 remaining cut Philadelphia's lead to 106-101, and he hit another with just more than a minute left to make it a six-point game. Curry shot 14 for 27, 10 of 18 on 3s, and knocked down a long 3 midway through the first while doing a scissor-kick in the air before throwing his arm up to celebrate moments later. ""Shots didn't fall in the second half,"" Curry said. ""They didn't get frazzled by any of our runs."" Golden State's Alfonzo McKinnie hit all five of his shots for 11 points making his first career start in his 56th game after Klay Thompson was a late scratch because of an illness. The Warriors will try to get back on track at home Saturday against the Lakers, who left Oracle Arena on Christmas night with a 127-101 win despite losing LeBron James in the third quarter to a left groin strain. James returned from a 17-game absence Thursday night against the Clippers for his first game since the injury. Cousins went 3 for 10 and played 25 minutes in his sixth game overall since coming back from surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon he hurt last January with New Orleans. ""Obviously I'm still not where I want to be,"" Cousins said. ""... I'm working my tail off. Just be patient."" The Sixers went ahead 95-84 late in the third on Embiid's basket, outscoring Golden State 42-26 in the quarter. Golden State, which has a double-digit winning streak for the sixth consecutive season and is coming off a 5-0 road trip, shot 46.6 percent and was 11 of 38 from deep.

"LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James looked like his old self, even if he wasn't feeling like it after his first game since Christmas. James had 24 points and 14 rebounds in his return from a 17-game injury absence, and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Clippers 123-120 in overtime Thursday night after blowing a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead. ""Definitely ecstatic about being back out there with my guys,"" he said, ""but being out five weeks, I'm feeling it right now. I wish I could click my shoes together right now and be home in my bed."" James came up one assist shy of a triple-double. He made 5 of 7 free throws, had four turnovers and no fouls in 40 minutes of his first game since Dec. 25 at Golden State, when he strained his left groin. ""I'm looking forward to seeing how I feel tomorrow,"" he said. ""That's going to be the telltale sign of all the rehabbing and the working and everything I've been putting in these last five weeks."" The Lakers were 6-11 during the longest absence of his 16-year career. ""He looked good,"" said Tobias Harris, who guarded James much of the game. Tied 118-all, James scored the go-ahead basket in overtime. Lance Stephenson drove for a flailing layup, hitting Boban Marjanovic in the nose with his left elbow while getting fouled. After a review by the officials, no additional penalty was called. The review was for ""a possible or potential hostile act,"" crew chief John Goble told a pool reporter after the game. Goble said the on-court ruling was a defensive foul and there was no additional contact. Stephenson completed the three-point play that kept the Lakers ahead 123-118. ""I don't know how you can come to that call,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""You make contact with the head, it's a flagrant. It was too obvious. It was an elbow to the face. Why put in those rules if you're not going to call it?"" Marjanovic's teammate Lou Williams added, ""Boban gets penalized so much for being big. If you elbow a guy away from the basket, it should be an offensive foul."" Avery Bradley and Williams missed on the same possession, and Williams missed a free throw when Stephenson got called for a technical in a tussle with Bradley. The Clippers were 14 of 26 from the foul line. Williams couldn't get a potential tying 3-pointer off in the right corner before the final buzzer. Stephenson added 20 points and matched a career high with five 3-pointers for the Lakers. Brandon Ingram added 19 points, and Rajon Rondo had 14 points and 13 rebounds. They enjoyed strong support from the Staples Center crowd as the visiting team. Williams led the Clippers with 24 points. Patrick Beverley added 17. Harris hit a 3-pointer with 35 seconds left in regulation, tying it at 112-all after the Clippers fought back after trailing by 14 early in the fourth. ""The good thing is we kept fighting all night,"" Harris said. The Lakers led by seven with just under two minutes to play, but the Clippers erased the deficit on baskets by Williams and Marjanovic before Harris scored from near the right baseline. James scored five of the Lakers' first seven points in the fourth for a 94-85 lead. The Clippers made 5 of 7 free throws to close to 103-101. The Lakers gained a 14-point lead near the end of the third quarter on Stephenson's 3-pointer. They outscored the Clippers 33-22 in the period. TIP-INS Lakers: They improved to 11-13 on the road. ... James is the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game, where he will captain the Western Conference team. ... Kyle Kuzma (left hip strain) and Josh Hart (left knee tendinitis) also returned.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  At both ends of the court, the Charlotte Hornets had too much at the end for the Memphis Grizzlies. Kemba Walker scored 23 points, Marvin Williams hit two key 3-pointers and Bismack Biyombo swatted away a pair of late shots as the Hornets beat the depleted Memphis Grizzlies 100-92 Friday night. Memphis suited up just 10 healthy players and was minus star Mike Conley, who sat because of soreness in his left knee. Starters Kyle Anderson and Jaren Jackson Jr. were also sidelined. Williams' 26-foot shot with 2:55 left tied it, and his deep jumper 38 seconds later gave the Hornets the lead for good at 93-90. ""They were playing us the same,"" said Williams, who finished with 16 points. ""I was just able to make those shots. I wasn't doing that early on."" Malik Monk, who scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, had two 3-pointers in the final period. The Hornets were shooting just 36.8 percent from 3-point land through the third quarter. ""Marvin was great, Malik was great,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""The second half especially, just getting downhill and getting to the rim. Knocking that shot down, (Malik) is getting more and more comfortable down there. He looks really confident shooting the ball right now. So give those two guys a lot of credit."" Biyombo, who finished with seven rebounds and three blocks, had just one point but made a difference on the defensive end. The 6-foot-9 center blocked JaMychal Green's dunk attempt with 1:48 to go and swatted away a layup attempt by Shelvin Mack 20 seconds later. ""I think we struggled to find a bucket down the stretch,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""They had guys in Kemba, Tony Parker, those guys that are used to having the ball in their hands in big moments. We struggled from the offensive end to find a bucket. That was able to give them the opportunity down the stretch."" Parker finished with 15 points and seven assists for Charlotte. Charlotte had a tough time matching Memphis' energy and effort at the start, and Borrego said he didn't think his team ""came out with the right spirit."" But Monk and Williams came up big when the Hornets needed it. ""We expect that from those guys,"" Walker said. ""When teams are covering me the way these guys are covering me nowadays we expect guys to come in and make shots and Marv was huge and Malik was huge."" Mack led Memphis with 19 points and nine assists, Justin Holiday and Ivan Rabb added 15 points each and Joakim Noah and Green each had 10 points for the Grizzlies.

"David Fizdale explains what the Kristaps Porzingis trade means for the Knicks' future. (1:05) NEW YORK -- Kyrie Irving heard the ""We want Kyrie! We want Kyrie!"" chants that echoed through Madison Square Garden. He seemed more annoyed than flattered. ""It's nothing but a distraction at this point,"" he said. Irving and the Boston Celtics handled it as easily as they handled the overmatched Knicks, winning 113-99 on Friday night in the first game since New York traded Kristaps Porzingis. Irving had 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists before a crowd eager to start the free agent wooing five months early. The trade to Dallas gave the Knicks money to chase two top free agents this summer and fans showed Irving that they want him to be one of them, cheering him before and during his return from a two-game absence with a hip injury. Irving is one of the headline names in the 2019 free agent class, and though he said at a Celtics fan event last fall that he intended to re-sign in Boston, that may be no guarantee. He told reporters at the morning shootaround to ""Ask me July 1"" if his plans had changed. Discouraged earlier this season by the play of some of his younger teammates, his frustration now is with the talk about matters beyond basketball, with the trade deadline less than a week away and his name being tied to Anthony Davis' future as he seeks a trade from New Orleans. So the former New Jersey high school star figured it would be a scene when he was back in the area. ""Like I said, I'm appreciative of the fan support I get in any arena, but of course coming back home,"" he said. ""Obviously what's going on in terms of that noise and commentary is just a bunch of nonsense right now. Can't do anything about it so I'm just accepting, I'm appreciative, but at the same time I've got a game to focus on."" Marcus Morris added 18 points for the Celtics, who won for the eighth time in nine games and remain supportive of Irving. ""He's a guy that's very polarizing in the NBA and the world so everything he says, even if it's not really that serious, it's going to be taken out of proportion,"" Morris said. ""But like I said, he still comes in, he's a professional. We all love him, we all want him here."" Damyean Dotson scored 22 points and Kevin Knox had 21 for the Knicks, who dropped their 12th straight. The Knicks dealt Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke to Dallas along with the injured Porzingis, getting Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews in return, plus two future first-round picks. The new players weren't available, so the Knicks started with a backcourt of Dotson and Kadeem Allen. The short-handed lineup hung around into the fourth quarter before opening February with a loss after going a combined 3-24 in December and January. TIP-INS Celtics: Al Horford and Gordon Hayward each had 14 points. ... Irving gave his jersey to his father after the game. Knicks: Coach David Fizdale said the new players had been in the arena Friday before the game. ... Luke Kornet started at center and scored nine points after missing the last five games with a sprained left ankle. GOODBYE AND GOOD LUCK Fizdale said he and Porzingis had a nice chat Thursday, wishing each other and joking about never getting onto the court. He said he didn't question whether there was more he could have done to keep Porzingis happy in New York. ""I can't think that way. He's obviously been here and has dealt with whatever he's had to deal with throughout the course of his career. I can't personalize that and put that on me,"" Fizdale said. ""Obviously I really worked hard to build a great relationship with him, going over to Latvia and everything, and really trying to involve him in a lot of the stuff that we're doing."" KYRIE'S CHEERS Fizdale, on the chants for Irving: ""You know, I am on a whole other planet when it comes to that stuff. I am just constantly into how do I help these guys win the next play, how do I get them past the last play?""","401071444"
"Dwyane Wade is appreciative of his special addition to the 2019 All-Star game, and jokingly adds how LeBron James ""better"" draft him. (0:55) MIAMI --  Paul George has endured some rough nights in Miami. Friday was not one of them. George scored 43 points and had a career-high 10 3-pointers, Dennis Schroder scored 24 of his 28 points in the second quarter and the Oklahoma City Thunder extended the NBA's longest current winning streak to seven games by beating the Miami Heat 118-102. ""Paul George, tonight, was tremendous,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We basically tried every coverage we had in our playbook: regular man, trapping him, zone. ... One of the more impressive shooting displays I've seen this season."" George once lost 11 consecutive appearances in Miami, going through some brutal defeats when he was with Indiana and the Pacers couldn't break through the Heat in what seemed like their annual battle for the Eastern Conference title. But he was never better on the Heat home floor than he was Friday, connecting on 14 of 23 shots and 10 of 16 from 3-point land. At the end, he got to exchange jerseys with Heat guard Dwyane Wade. ""D-Wade is a guy I look up to and we've shared a bond through competition and now through a mentorship as a guy I look at and honestly want to model my brand and off-the-court stuff like,"" George said. ""It's great for him. He's had an amazing run. I couldn't say enough really about D-Wade and what he's been to this league and honestly for my development. He played a huge role in my development and who I am now as a player."" Russell Westbrook got his fifth straight triple-double and 18th of the season, finishing with 14 points, 12 rebounds and 14 assists. Steven Adams added 13 for the Thunder. Oklahoma City beat Miami for the sixth straight time, and became the second team to have two separate winning streaks of at least seven games this season. Golden State is the other, with streaks of 11 and eight games. ""There were some real good positive things to take from the game all the way around,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Kelly Olynyk scored 21 for Miami, which fell to the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference. Josh Richardson scored 18 and Hassan Whiteside finished with 12 points and 16 rebounds for the Heat. Wade was announced as an All-Star earlier in the day for the 13th time, after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver decided Wade and Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki merited becoming special additions to the player pool for the Feb. 17 game in Charlotte. Fans roared when Wade entered the game for the first time and was introduced as an All-Star. They didn't have much else to yell about, at least in a positive light. George, who set a franchise record for 3s in a game, had 16 points in the first quarter to get the Thunder going and 12 more in the fourth to finish things off. ""He's in a groove, man,"" Wade said. ""He's been playing phenomenal basketball. I've said it plenty of times: That's my favorite player. I love watching PG play."" TIP-INS Thunder: Schroder went 9 for 9 in the second quarter, helping stake Oklahoma City to a 72-53 halftime lead. ... Westbrook had eight assists in the first quarter.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Still feeling the sting of an NBA All-Star snub, Rudy Gobert responded by dominating on both ends of the court on Friday night. Gobert had 25 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Utah Jazz to a 128-112 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Gobert made all seven of his field goal attempts and became the second Jazz player to total 25 points and 10 rebounds while shooting 100 percent from the field. Gobert, the reigning NBA defensive player of the year, was not selected as a Western Conference reserve despite being a league leader in multiple defensive categories. He acknowledged the snub fueled his desire to make an impact. ""People know me. I know myself,"" Gobert said. ""I'm going to carry that for a while. It is what it is. I'm always going to come out to win and to be there for my teammates."" Gobert had to overcame early foul trouble to make a statement. He picked up two fouls just four minutes into the first quarter and played just 12 minutes in the first half. With him on the bench, the Jazz struggled to slow down the Hawks. Atlanta shot 22 of 49 (.449) from the field in the first half and led by as many as 11 points in the second quarter. ""We started the game a little slow defensively and we knew that we had to come out ready in the second half,"" Gobert said. ""We did a good job, after a rough first half, of coming back and getting some stops. It got us going offensively, too."" Gobert set the tone by tallying 19 points and 11 rebounds in 16 minutes over the final two quarters. His best stretch came during the first eight minutes of the third quarter. The Jazz outscored Atlanta 23-9 during that stretch. Donovan Mitchell and Kyle Korver scored back-to-back baskets to cap that lengthy run and give Utah an 81-69 lead. Gobert made the biggest impact during that stretch, however, scoring nine points, collecting four rebounds, and blocking two shots. ""He really kept himself in it mentally so that when he was able to come back in and get to play and not be in foul trouble, he was really ready to go,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. Ricky Rubio added 22 points and 11 assists, and Joe Ingles chipped in 19 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. Seven Utah players scored in double figures as the Jazz won their third straight at home. Trae Young had 28 points and nine assists to lead the Hawks. John Collins scored 19 points, Dewayne Dedmon added 15 and Kevin Huerter finished with 14. Atlanta lost for the third time in four games. Young said the Hawks got bogged down when they started misfiring on good looks in the third quarter. ""Utah's loaded at each position, and they all bring different skill sets,"" Young said. ""You gotta focus and lock in when you're playing against a really good team like them."" Utah made 10 of its first 14 shots to open the first quarter. Ingles had a pair of layups and a pair of 3-pointers to fuel the strong start and help the Jazz race to a 25-20 lead. Atlanta kept pace behind the hot shooting of Young. He had four baskets in the first six minutes, the last of which sparked a 12-0 run that gave the Hawks a 32-25 lead. The Jazz rallied late in the first quarter and took a 40-39 lead early in the second on back-to-back layups by Ingles and Korver. Atlanta surged back in front with a 14-2 run. Huerter dished to Collins for a layup to spark the run and ended it with a jumper that gave the Hawks their largest lead at 53-42. Utah made it a one-possession game at 60-58 on back-to-back baskets by Mitchell and Jae Crowder in the final minute before halftime. ""We just had to turn our intensity up,"" Mitchell said. ""They were a little bit too comfortable in the beginning of the game. Just made them feel us a little bit more."" Utah maintained a double-digit lead through much of the fourth quarter. Atlanta closed within eight at 113-105 on a dunk by Collins. The Jazz answered with a 15-5 run, punctuated by back-to-back baskets from Mitchell and Ingles, that gave them a 128-110 lead with 1:35 left. TWITTER AFFAIR Gobert broke down and became emotional while recounting his mother crying over his all-star snub during Utah's pregame shootaround on Friday morning. It generated tweets from Warriors players Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala and Nuggets guard Isaiah Thomas. He countered with a jab at Green, referencing a controversy involving the Golden State forward over a photo he posted on his Snapchat account in 2016. ""As long as he doesn't post anything on Snapchat, we're good,"" Gobert said. SWEET SEVENTEEN Utah has scored at least 100 points in 17 straight games. It is the longest single-season streak for the franchise since the 1983-84 season and third-longest such streak in Jazz history. TIP INS Hawks: Young made five 3-pointers to overtake Salim Stoudamire for the Hawks' rookie 3-point shooting record. Young has made 84 3-pointers this season.

"DENVER -- Nikola Jokic had 31 points, 13 rebounds and 9 assists, Malik Beasley had a career-high 35 points and the Denver Nuggets beat the Houston Rockets 136-122 on Friday night. Houston's James Harden scored 30 points to extend his streak to 25 games of scoring 30 or more points. He needed a late 3-pointer to keep the streak alive, and it came well after the game was in hand for Denver. The Nuggets couldn't stop Harden, but they ended a nine-game losing streak against Houston. Harden's streak started with a 50-point night against the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 13, and nearly ended on a tough shooting night for the reigning league MVP. He hit five of his first six shots and scored 15 points in the first quarter but then went cold. He missed 10 of his next 11 shots and also missed four free throws. He hit two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to pull Houston within nine points, but Jokic scored six straight points to put it away. Harden's step-back 3-pointer with 1:05 left gave him 30. Torrey Craig had a career-high 22 points for the Rockets, who scored 43 points in the first quarter. The Nuggets responded in the second with a 48-point outburst. They had 35 of those in the final 7:31 when they transformed a five-point deficit into an 83-71 lead at halftime. Denver led by 20 in the third quarter, but the Rockets got within nine twice before the Nuggets pulled away.

Murray is known for his ability to play through pain, so there is concern about how long he will be out. ""Jamal is a guy we're not used to see miss games, so you know it's a really serious injury he's dealing with,"" coach Michael Malone said.

The Clippers trailed by 25 in the second quarter and were down 83-60 in the third before storming back to tie the game at 89 in the fourth. It was 91-all before Williams scored every Los Angeles point during a decisive run that put the Clippers up 107-96. Williams finished with 39 points. Detroit's Blake Griffin had 24 points and 11 rebounds against his former team, and Reggie Jackson added 29 points for the Pistons.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker calls it ""messing with the bigs' timing."" Time and time again, Walker found a way to get to basket on Saturday night and get shots off -- and make them -- among 7-footers in clutch situations, a rare trait for a 6-foot-1 point guard that has made him a three-time All-Star. Walker has come as close as you can to perfecting the art of stopping and starting on his drives and finding ways to freeze much taller defenders for just a moment, long enough to get up a layup off the glass. ""I try to do my best to throw them off as much as possible. That is what I have to do at my size,"" Walker said. ""It's a lot of different things. Using my body, timing. A lot of times they just can't time my jumps. Just trying to be as crafty as I can."" Then he laughed and said, ""but I do get my shot blocked a lot honestly."" But the Chicago Bulls couldn't stop him on Saturday night. Walker had 15 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter, and the Charlotte Hornets pulled away late to defeat Chicago 125-118 for their fifth straight win at home. Walker, an All-Star game starter for the first time, had 10 assists and finished 5 of 6 from the field in the fourth quarter, sparking an 18-4 run to hand the Bulls their fifth loss in six games. ""He's so crafty that you never know which direction he's going,"" said Bulls 7-foot forward Lauri Markkanen, who struggled to defend Walker on switches. ""He's got so many moves and counters and counters. He uses his body real well to draw fouls and protect the ball."" Malik Monk added 18 points and Nic Batum added 16 for the Hornets, who pulled back to .500 for the first time since Jan. 2. Charlotte trailed 100-99 with eight minutes remaining before Walker scored nine straight points, including a drive through the lane where he lowered his head and got past Zach LaVine before flipping up a contested right-handed layup and drawing a foul for an old-fashioned three-point play. Bulls coach Jim Boylen called Walker a ""monster"" before the game, saying he has a way of making big shots that are ""depressing"" for an opposing defense. ""If he gets even with you (on his drive), then it's over,"" Boylen said. If you're not chest-to-chest with him, if you get side-saddle with him, it's over."" TIP INS Bulls: LaVine returned to the starting lineup after sitting out Chicago's win over Miami on Wednesday night with a sprained right ankle. He had 18 points and five rebounds. He appeared to lack some of his explosiveness, but did have a dunk after driving around Walker. Hornets: Walker has 14 30-point games this season, the same number he had all of last season and one shy of his career-high of 15 in 2016-17. BIG NIGHT FOR PORTIS The Hornets overcame 33 points from Chicago's Bobby Portis and 30 from Lauri Markkanen. Both had nine rebounds. It was Portis who put on a show in the first half. The 6-foot-11, third-year forward from Arkansas scored 22 points off the bench in the second quarter alone, and eclipsed his previous season high before halftime with 28 points. Portis was 12 of 16 from the floor in the first half with four 3-pointers, but limited to five points in the second half after the Hornets began double-teaming him. ""It's something he's got to learn to play with as a team,"" Boylen said of countering the double teams. ""We talked about it, our spacing. It's a learning moment for us and we'll get better at it."" MONK ON A ROLL Hornets second-year guard Malik Monk is heating up, averaging 17 points while shooting 46 percent from the field over the last four games. ""I'm in the gym working so I know it's going to come at some point,"" Monk said of his shooting.","401071449"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Nikola Vucevic, as usual, was the key player for Orlando. But it was unexpected contributions from Jonathan Isaac and Wes Iwundu that were the difference in the Magic's 102-89 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night, their second straight win. Vucevic, selected for his first All-Star Game on Thursday, had 12 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, when Orlando put away a Brooklyn team that never got it going offensively the entire night. Vucevic and Isaac had three blocks apiece as the Magic limited the Nets to 36.3 percent shooting for the game, including just 10 of 38 (26.3 percent) on 3-point attempts. ""The first two times we played (the Nets), they got a lot of points in the paint and that opened up their 3-point shooting,"" Vucevic said. ""But we played a really good game defensively this time. Jonathan and I were contesting shots and made it tough on them."" Isaac had his second straight double-double (he has three all season) with 10 points and 12 rebounds. Evan Fournier had 16 points, Aaron Gordon 15 and D.J. Augustin handed out eight assists to go with his 12 points. However, it was Iwundu's 10 points, seven in the final minute of the third quarter and a three-point play early in the fourth that ignited the Magic offense. Brooklyn had gone to a zone defense during that stretch, but came out of it after Iwundu's run. ""That's the Wes we need every game,"" Fournier said. ""That's part of being a consistent team. We need a guy to play like that every night. He was a big part of our win."" Brooklyn lost for the third time in its last four games and looked tired in doing so. The Nets were short with nearly every 3-point attempt and had three airballs from behind the line. D'Angelo Russell had 23 points for Brooklyn. Shabazz Napier added 15 points and Ed Davis was the only other Net in double figures with 11. ""We've got to freshen up a little bit,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I don't think we had great juice tonight, one through 12. We didn't have the pop we normally do. It happens. It's slippage, but this isn't the end of the world. I just wish we would have played better."" The Magic took a 78-70 lead into the final period and stretched it to 89-79 after Vucevic finally got free inside for six straight points. The Nets shot 7 for 24 (29 percent) in the fourth quarter. They made only 2 of 12 3-point attempts, nullifying any hopes for a comeback. Brooklyn committed 19 turnovers in the game. ""Everybody is a little banged up and fatigued at this point,"" said Nets guard Joe Harris, who was 3 of 12 for the game, including 0 for 5 on 3-pointers. ""Obviously people get to the All-Star break and you get a little time to rejuvenate yourself, but right now all the focus is on these last few games and we have to make them count."" TIP-INS Nets: Napier was bleeding after catching an elbow in the head from Vucevic late in the third quarter. He returned early in the fourth. ... Nets bench outscored Orlando's 46-25. That has happened a league-high 46 times. ... Brooklyn averaged 115 points in January, the second-highest monthly scoring average in team history. Magic: Backup C Mo Bamba missed the game with a sore left leg. ... F Terrence Ross, who had 30 points in his last game, had only seven against Brooklyn.

"WASHINGTON --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks are all smiles -- until game time. ""As a team, I feel like we think about the game less,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We just smile. We just have fun. And we know when the game starts at 7:30 or 7 o'clock, we're going to do whatever it takes to win. We don't try to overthink things."" Antetokounmpo scored 37 points, making all of his season-high 17 free throws in a perfect night at the line for Milwaukee, and had 10 rebounds to help the NBA-leading Bucks rout the Washington Wizards 131-115 on Saturday night. Coming off a big victory at Toronto on Thursday night, the Bucks have won three straight, nine of 10 and 20 of 24. Brook Lopez added 21 points, and Khris Middleton had 20 for Milwaukee. Starting point guard Eric Bledsoe sat out to rest a sore left Achilles. The Bucks were 24 of 24 from the free-throw line, hit 17 of their 39 attempts from beyond the arc, and played well enough to limit everyone other than Antetokounmpo to fewer than 30 minutes during the third stop of a four-game trip. They also avenged a 13-106 loss in Washington on Jan. 11, one of three games Antetokounmpo has missed this season. ""We came here off a big win last time where we had beaten Houston and sometimes the schedule catches up to you,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""And Washington played great the last time we were here. But for us to win Thursday night and to follow it up with a win tonight Saturday is a good sign."" Milwaukee had a 17-2 run late in the second quarter, led by 23 at halftime and 32 early in third quarter. Antetokounmpo scored seven of the last 10 points in big second-quarter run, including a thunderous slam over Jeff Green that led to a three-point play. Bradley Beal scored 24 points for Washington, Green added 20, and Otto Porter Jr. 18. The Wizards are 9-7 since losing All-Star point guard John Wall for the season because of a heel injury, and remain 10th in the East. Should they find their way into eighth, they could face the Bucks in the first round of the playoffs. ""There was a message that they were sending,"" Beal said. ""And we play them again next week. So that's got to be how I take it. They sent a message for next week."" WAKE-UP SLAM Wizards point guard Tomas Satoransky brought the home crowd to life early with an emphatic driving dunk over Lopez. That gave Washington a 4-0 lead and prompted Budenholzer to call a timeout with only 45 seconds played. ""We gave up a dunk in transition,"" Budenholzer said. ""We gave up a layup in transition. We turned it over twice. It was not a good 45 seconds."" Satoransky converted the three-point play following the timeout. But the Bucks responded with a 20-6 run to take the lead for good. TIP-INS: Bucks: Have six winning streaks of three games or more this season. ... Budenholzer hopes Bledsoe's absence won't be a long one. ""We'll see today and tomorrow. We play again on Monday. I think it's the right thing for Eric."" Wizards: Porter started despite entering the night as a game-time decision with a sprained toe. ... Coach Scott Brooks received a technical foul between the first and second quarters.","401071451"
"CLEVELAND -- Rookie Luka Doncic matched his season high with 35 points and did a little bit of everything for Dallas, and Harrison Barnes scored 13 in the fourth quarter to lead the undermanned Mavericks to a 111-98 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night. With a contingent of fans waving Slovenian flags to support Doncic, the 19-year-old showed why the Mavericks are so excited about their future. He added 11 rebounds, six assists and made a couple long 3-pointers that drew gasps from the Quicken Loans crowd. Barnes made three 3-pointers in the fourth and finished with 17 points, and rookie Jalen Brunson added 15 for the Mavericks, who played their second game since acquiring star Kristaps Porzingis from New York in a blockbuster trade. Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke also came in the deal but are not eligible to play until their physicals are completed. Jordan Clarkson scored 19 for Cleveland. The Cavaliers, who have been dealing with injuries all season, suffered another one as forward Cedi Osman went out in the first half with a right ankle injury and did not return. Due to the trade, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle had only nine dressed players. Fortunately, one of them was Doncic, who sat out Thursday's game in Detroit with a sore left ankle. Doncic scored 18 points in the first quarter, when he became the sixth player since 2000 to score 1,000 points before turning 20. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker and Dwight Howard did it before Doncic, who will be 20 on Feb. 28. Doncic finished the first half with 28 points, 10 in the final 3:56 after the Mavericks went more than six minutes without a field goal. However, it was Brunson and Barnes who had the bigger impact in the second half. Shortly after replacing Doncic, Brunson converted a 4-point play with 8:56 left and Barnes made his 3s, the last giving Dallas a 106-91 lead with 4:34 left. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki received nice ovations each time he checked in or out. The 40-year-old has not officially announced his retirement, but Cleveland fans showed their love to one of the NBA's most popular players. ... Carlisle hopes Hall of Fame voters recognize the accomplishments of former NBA coach Bill Fitch, whom he called ""a master"" with ""staggering accomplishments."" Fitch won 944 games over 25 seasons, but Carlisle believes he doesn't get enough credit for rebuilding several franchises, including the Cavaliers. Fitch gave Carlisle his coaching start, hiring him after cutting him with the Nets. Cavaliers: Rookie G Collin Sexton shot 4 of 17. ... Coach Larry Drew doesn't expect F Kevin Love to return for Tuesday's game against Boston. Love hasn't played since Oct. 24 following left foot surgery. Love began participating in contact scrimmages this week. ... G David Nwaba returned after missing 18 games with a sprained left ankle. He scored 12 points in 15 minutes. ... It was a doubleheader of sorts for three Cleveland players -- G Kobi Simmons, F Deng Adel and F Jarod Blossomgame -- who were on the floor earlier in the day as the G League Canton Charge hosted the Windy City Bulls.","401071452"
"MIAMI --  Indiana's offense was nowhere to be found in the fourth quarter. Luckily for the Pacers, neither was Miami's. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 31 points, Darren Collison added 20 and the Pacers had a big third quarter to beat the struggling Heat 95-88 on Saturday night. Indiana ended a season-long four-game losing streak, which started in the game following the one where All-Star Victor Oladipo left with a season-ending knee injury. ""It was mental, I think,"" Bogdanovic said about the slide after losing Oladipo. ""We needed this win to get it going. We have enough quality in this locker room without Victor to put up the numbers."" The Pacers feasted on Miami turnovers, turning 24 of them into 31 points -- while seeing their 14 giveaways become only seven Heat points. Indiana won despite scoring only 11 points in the fourth, because it held the Heat to exactly 11 in the fourth as well. ""That was pretty ugly in the fourth quarter for both teams,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""They were just able to hold on."" Myles Turner scored 14 points and Thaddeus Young added 11 for the Pacers. They swept the Heat 3-0 this season. ""It's all about adapting,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said about life without Oladipo. ""It takes time and with different guys in and out of the lineup, it's not going to be a quick fix."" Dwyane Wade scored 21 points for Miami, which dropped its third straight game overall and fourth in a row at home. Hassan Whiteside added 19 points and 14 rebounds, and Josh Richardson and Kelly Olynyk each scored 14 points for the Heat -- who leave Monday for a five-game West Coast trip. ""You lose three in a row at home, it's tough,"" Wade said. ""It's a lot of things combined. Got to figure it out, man."" Miami led 54-53 at the half, but Indiana quickly took control from there. Indiana scored the first 10 points of the second half, needing only 1:59 to do so, turning a one-point deficit at intermission into a quick nine-point lead. The Pacers eventually led by 18 late in the third, before the Heat found a way to claw back into things. A 13-2 run over the final 2:31 of the period -- started by a 3-pointer from Wade, and ended by another 3-pointer from Wade -- gave Miami new life, and cut Indiana's lead to 84-77. The Heat scored five points in five seconds to end that spurt, with Whiteside making a layup while getting fouled, missing the free throw, Miami corralling the rebound and Wade making a 3. But the Heat never got closer than five again, and fell to 2-13 this season when scoring less than 100 points. ""We've got to figure it out,"" Wade said. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana took 17 of the first 25 shots, largely because Miami committed seven of the game's first eight turnovers. ... Tyreke Evans returned after missing the last three games with lower back soreness. He was 0 for 7 in 16 minutes. ... The Pacers led for 29 minutes on Saturday, after leading for 17 minutes in their last four games combined. Heat: The Heat fell to 17-3 in games where they allow 101 points or less. ... The Heat aren't back home until Feb. 23, and play their next six on the road -- four of them against teams that are likely playoff locks. ... The Heat shot 9 for 30 from 3-point range. ... Starters Tyler Johnson and James Johnson were a combined 2 for 9 for five points in 34 minutes. SLOW START Neither team scored in the first 3 minutes of the fourth quarter. Justise Winslow took a pass from Wade for a layup with 8:54 left, the first points by either side in the final period. Indiana went nearly five minutes in the fourth before scoring. HOME-HOME Miami wrapped up the 21st home-home back-to-back in franchise history -- and the Heat have gone 21-21 in those games.","401071453"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs were hit by a couple of surprise attacks. They overcame both. LaMarcus Aldridge had 25 points and 14 rebounds and the Spurs withstood another bat intrusion -- with a nifty play from the team's coyote mascot -- and held off the depleted New Orleans Pelicans 113-108 on Saturday night. ""The hardest teams to play against in this league is the guys that want to be out there and play that don't get the opportunity to play that much,"" said San Antonio's DeMar DeRozan, who had 13 points, six rebounds and five assists. ""Because they're going to bring a whole type of intensity and type of play that you're probably not used to. A lot of things come unexpected and they really have nothing to lose."" The Spurs led for all but the opening basket in successfully sweeping a four-game homestand, but their fifth straight victory didn't come with some drama. A bat began hovering above the court three minutes into the game, causing officials to delay play. It was the second straight home game delayed by the winged intruders, with three bats buzzing the court Thursday night against Brooklyn. Arena workers were able to shoo the bats into the rafters against the Nets, but the Spurs were better prepared against the Pelicans. An arena official walked onto the court with a net, but missed the bat on his first attempt. Almost on cue, the Spurs' mascot charged onto the court dressed in a Batman costume with a net. He missed his first diving swipe at the bat, then dove again near the scorer's table and caught the bat in his net to huge cheers from Spurs players and fans. The worker placed the bat into a towel and took him from the court, with play resuming after a delay of only 1 1/2 minutes. ""I threw to hit it with the ball,"" Aldridge said. ""I tried to, but I wasn't the hero tonight."" Rudy Gay and Marco Belinelli added 17 points each for San Antonio. Anthony Davis was among five injured players out for New Orleans. Davis, who is listed out with a sprained left index finger, has not played since informing the Pelicans he wants to be traded from the franchise that drafted him first overall out of Kentucky in 2012. ""We never give up,"" Pelicans point guard Jrue Holiday said. ""I feel like people think because we're short-handed or whatever may be, that we're going to get blown out but we haven't had many blowouts this year. That's because we're always going to fight until there's zero on the clock, no matter who's playing."" Frank Jackson had a career-high 25 points to lead New Orleans. The Spurs emptied their bench while holding a 106-84 lead but were forced to put their starters back in after the Pelicans went on a 24-5 run. Jackson's layup pulled New Orleans to 111-108 with 38 seconds remaining. ""I won't say I wasn't nervous doing it,"" Popovich said of keeping the reserves in. ""I just decided to stick with them and let them sink or swim for a while but when it got to three obviously, I had to do something different."" After DeRozan missed a floater, New Orleans' Tim Frazier upfaked and spun around Rudy Gay, but his 3-pointer circled the rim and fell off with 4.4 seconds left. DeRozan closed the game out with a pair of free throws. DeRozan finished with 13 points, six rebounds and five assists. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis missed his seventh straight game. New Orleans is 2-4 in those games. ... The Pelicans also were without Nikola Mirotic, E'Twaun Moore, Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle. Spurs: Aldridge has 18,013 points, becoming the only player in the league with 18,000 points and 7,500 rebounds since 2006, the year he was drafted. ... Pau Gasol has 20,882 points, moving past Bob Pettit for 37th in NBA history. ... Dante Cunningham missed the game with a sore right ankle. HONORING ANTON The San Antonio Spurs honored media relations official Pete Anton, who is the oldest person employed by any NBA team, prior to the game. Anton, who is 98, has been with the Spurs since the franchise relocated to San Antonio from Dallas. The Spurs gave Anton a framed jersey with his name on it. ""Petey, he's like a father, a grandfather, a great grandfather, a brother, an uncle, he's got all that, all rolled into one,"" Popovich said. ""He's just the sweetest man. When you're around him, you know that he's a better guy than you. He's just one of those kinds of people. We all know a couple of people like that, and he's one of them. Obviously, he's been around here longer than anybody else. It's just fun to see that kind of continuity. He's always got a smile, no matter who it is, no matter what the situation.""","401071454"
"DeMarcus Cousins explains his recovery process after his injury, and how it impacted him physically. (1:07) OAKLAND, Calif. --  DeMarcus Cousins provided an emphatic dunk that might have been the timeliest play of the night and ignited the fiery big man's new home crowd. Klay Thompson's steady hand did much of the rest in a strange game when it took Stephen Curry more than 3 1/2 quarters to finally make a basket. Thompson returned from a one-game absence with an illness to score 28 points and light up the Lakers for the second time in 13 days, leading the Golden State Warriors to a 115-101 victory Saturday over a Los Angeles team again missing LeBron James. ""Luckily the sickness is nearly gone,"" Thompson said. ""I felt very refreshed."" Curry missed his first eight shots before a layup with 6:20 remaining and still wound up with 14 points, two days after going off for 41 in a loss to the 76ers when he hit 10 3-pointers. The other Warriors picked up the slack. Andre Iguodala hit a go-ahead 3 in the final minute of the third, two more early in the fourth as Golden State pulled away and finished with 17 points. Cousins contributed his first double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds in his second home game and seventh in all since coming back from a nearly yearlong recovery from surgery for a ruptured left Achilles tendon. Kevin Durant added 21 points and 11 of the Warriors' 31 assists. The Lakers hung tough without James just as they did here in a 127-101 victory Christmas night. They lost James in the third quarter of that game to a strained left groin. He returned from a 17-game absence Thursday night against the Clippers only to sit again Saturday. James' rest was for what coach Luke Walton called ""load management."" The four-time MVP had been set for his second game back but woke up Friday ""very sore"" after playing 40 minutes in the 123-120 overtime win against the Clippers. He finished with 24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists. ""It took us some time to adjust to what the new game plan was,"" Walton said. Cousins drove for a filthy one-handed slam against Kyle Kuzma at the 5:28 mark of the third then stared him down and trash-talked to pick up a technical. ""I thought his dunk brought the arena to life and brought the team to life,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""We were searching for energy and emotion up until that point. This was a typical game where you let your guard down a little because the other team's best player's not playing, so there was no life in the building and our guys weren't generating any energy. That play changed all of that."" Golden State had its 11-game winning streak, longest in the NBA this season, snapped with a 113-104 loss to the 76ers on Thursday night in Cousins' home debut. The Warriors missed Thompson in that one. He connected on his first four shots Saturday with a 3 and finished 10 for 15. On Jan. 21 at L.A., Thompson tied an NBA record by making his first 10 attempts from 3-point range -- going 10 for 11 from deep overall and hitting seven in the third quarter -- on the way to 44 points in the Warriors' 130-111 win. Thompson doesn't worry a bit about Curry's shooting touch, impressed at how he keeps firing. ""The man is not immune from an off night, even though it's very, very rare,"" Thompson said. ""Even when he's 0 for 8 he's going to have that gunner mentality, and I think he's earned that over his career."" TIP-INS Lakers: Reserve C Tyson Chandler also rested for the Lakers. ... Los Angeles shot 7 for 27 from 3-point range. Warriors: Durant notched his fourth points-assists double-double of the season. ... Upon learning Nuggets coach Michael Malone would coach the West All-Stars with Denver's 107-106 win at Minnesota, a beaming, laughing and fist-pumping Kerr said leaving the postgame interview room, ""Take care, guys, have fun in Charlotte."" ... Draymond Green had seven more assists to give him 75 in his past eight games. McGEE'S BLING Ex-Warriors center JaVale McGee received his championship ring at last. He had been sick and didn't travel with the team to the Bay Area for the Christmas game. McGee received his ring from Iguodala, who initially presented his former teammate with an empty box as a joke. McGee then held the ring to either side of the court and waved during a rousing ovation for the big man who spent two seasons in the Bay Area. ""JaVale was a big part of the last two championships,"" Kerr said. ""It's only right to honor him and present him his ring and give him his moment in front of our fans for them to say thank you."" RECRUITING KLAY Lakers fans way up in the rafters chanted ""We want Thompson! We want Thompson!"" -- he becomes a free agent this summer -- as he shot free throws in the second quarter. His father, Mychal, was a star for Los Angeles. ""They should want Klay,"" Kerr quipped. ""If I were sitting with them I'd chant the same thing.""","401071455"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Nikola Jokic took the ball for Denver behind the basket after a turnover by Minnesota and, seeing teammate Malik Beasley breaking open past the defense, fired a full-court pass as if he were playing football as a 7-foot quarterback. Beasley hauled it in and didn't even have to dribble, dropping in a layup for a three-point lead with 1:02 left. The Nuggets are catching everything in stride these days. Jokic had his 25th career triple-double with 13 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists, reaching the milestone with his bold heave to Beasley that helped the Nuggets hang on for a 107-106 victory over the Timberwolves on Saturday night. ""We just kind of find a way to win the games, especially the close ones. We never quit anymore,"" Jokic said. The Wolves felt like they did, at least on that fateful play. Andrew Wiggins was jogging back, but he was too many steps behind Beasley to catch him. Jerryd Bayless had his head down and didn't see the ball until it was too late. ""That ball was up in the air like a Ray Guy punt, for four seconds,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""But our guys find ways."" With a dunk by Luol Deng followed by a steal by Taj Gibson off Monte Morris, the Wolves took final possession with 14.5 seconds remaining with a prime opportunity to win. The play designed by coach Ryan Saunders for Bayless to drive to the basket with Karl-Anthony Towns near the rim was thwarted by Denver, forcing the Wolves to settle for a 3-point try by Deng from the corner that bounced out with 3.5 seconds to go, though. The rebound by Towns, who had 31 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists, was too late to create with. ""Got a good look,"" Towns said. ""It just didn't go in."" The Wolves were more upset by their defensive lapse a few seconds earlier. ""We just weren't paying attention,"" Bayless said. Said Wiggins: ""Bad awareness."" Beasley had 22 points, Will Barton pitched in 20 and Morris had 17 points and 10 assists for Denver. The resilient Nuggets (37-15) showed why they're tied with Golden State for the Western Conference lead while raising their record on the second half of back-to-back games to a gaudy 8-1. Winning their sixth straight game as they started a four-game road trip after arriving at their hotel around 4 a.m., the Nuggets added another accolade by ensuring that Malone will head to the All-Star Game with Jokic by virtue of a tiebreaker edge over the Warriors. ""To be going there with Nikola is going to be great. I told him that if he's on the other team, I'm going to double-team him every time. So his All-Star debut might be a tough one,"" Malone joked. THE JOKER The Wolves failed to take full advantage of Jokic's extended time on the bench in the second half after he argued a foul against him and was slapped with a technical foul by official Tony Brothers. When he was on the court, he was well-defended underneath by Taj Gibson, Gorgui Dieng and Towns, going just 4 for 13 from the floor. But the Serbian star is more than just a low-post scorer. The Nuggets are 23-2 when Jokic has a triple-double. He moved into a tie for 13th place with Clyde Drexler on the NBA's career list, with the 25th of his career. BAYLESS BOOST Bayless had 15 points and 10 assists for the Wolves, who welcomed Derrick Rose back in a reserve role for their banged-up backcourt, after he missed the previous three games and 11 of the last 19 because of right ankle trouble. They're still missing point guards Jeff Teague (six in a row and 15 of 23) and Tyus Jones (eight straight) to left ankle injuries. Then there's small forward Robert Covington, the centerpiece of the package that came back from Philadelphia for Jimmy Butler who has been out for 15 consecutive games because of a bone bruise on his right knee. The afterthought in that trade was Bayless, who needed more than a month after his acquisition to finish his left knee rehabilitation before finally making his debut for Minnesota. With little choice for Saunders but to play the 11th-year veteran, Bayless has scored in double digits in six straight games. TIP-INS Nuggets: With original backcourt starters Jamal Murray (sprained left ankle) and Gary Harris (right adductor strain) still out, the Nuggets improved to 7-2 with Beasley and 4-0 with Morris in the starting lineup. ... This was Beasley's ninth 20-point game this season. Timberwolves: Towns notched his 34th double-double and his 11th game with 30-plus points. ... The Timberwolves led 38-29 after the first quarter, their largest of the game and their second-highest opening-period total of the season.","401071456"
"PHOENIX --  The Atlanta Hawks were in a touchy situation in the final minutes against the ever-struggling Phoenix Suns. Then their two best young players pulled them out of danger. John Collins matched his career high with 35 points and fell one shy of his career best with 16 rebounds, and the Hawks handed the Suns their 10th straight loss, 118-112 on Saturday night. Trae Young scored 17 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter, when the Hawks pulled away. ""I don't think I helped my team in the first three quarters,"" Young said. ""I just felt like I needed to step up. Everyone on the team played well except for me so I decided to do a little bit more for my team in the fourth quarter."" Devin Booker scored 32, Josh Jackson 25 and Mikal Bridges 20 for Phoenix. Deandre Ayton, back after missing six games with a sprained left ankle, had 13 points and 11 rebounds. Booker said Collins and Young ""carried the weight"" for the Hawks, ""especially down the stretch. You know, that's `winning time.' I remember when I was at Kentucky, you know, we were down a lot late some games and we understand. We call it `winning time."" Atlanta won despite committing 25 turnovers, resulting in 33 Phoenix points, compared with 10 turnovers by the Suns for 13 Atlanta points. There were 11 ties and 10 lead changes in a tight first half with Atlanta leading 58-57 at the break. The Hawks' biggest lead in the first two quarters was 10, the Suns' five. A 12-2 run put the Hawks up 42-32 with 9:08 left in the half. But Phoenix responded with a 13-2 surge that put the Suns up 45-44 on Booker's three-point play with 5:52 left in the half. Kevin Huerter sank a pair of 3s to help boost Atlanta's lead to 55-49 but the Suns outscored the Hawks 8-3 the rest of the half to make it a one-point game. Phoenix built its biggest advantage of the night, 84-76, on Booker's breakaway dunk after an Atlanta turnover with 3:08 left in the third quarter. But the Hawks finished the quarter with a 10-4 spurt to cut the Suns' lead to 88-86 entering the fourth. It stayed tight with Phoenix taking its last lead at 103-101 on Jackson's hook shot with 3:59 left. Atlanta went on a 15-4 run to go up 116-107 on Collins' dunk with 57 seconds left and that was it for the Suns, who matched their longest losing streak of the season. ""Tough effort by our guys in the fourth,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce. ""I thought our guys didn't play great, obviously not smart all of the time with 25 turnovers, but I thought we were tough."" COMFORTABLE LOSS Booker said afterward the Suns have become too comfortable with losing after doing it for so many years. ""It's been a common theme here for the past couple of years. We need to break it,"" he said. ""The city deserves more. Everybody supporting us deserves more."" BAD BOARDS Phoenix was outrebounded 53-37 and gave up several critical offensive boards down the stretch. Collins had 10 of Atlanta's 16 offensive rebounds. ""We say we rebound the ball, we win the game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We didn't rebound the ball, we lost the game. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Once James Harden figures out the best way to take over a game, there isn't much other NBA teams can do to stop him. Harden attacked on both ends of the court and quickly filled up the stat sheet to power the Houston Rockets to a 125-98 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. Harden had 43 points for his 26th straight game with at least 30 points. The 30-point streak is the third-longest in NBA history, trailing only Wilt Chamberlain's runs of 65 and 31 games. ""It was a must win for us and we came out here and played like it,"" the reigning NBA MVP said. ""Defensively, we got after it. Offensively, we moved the basketball. Everybody played well. That's the effort it's going to take for us on every single night."" Harden also had 12 rebounds, six steals, five assists and four blocks. He was 12 of 22 from the field, making 4 of 12 3-pointers, and made all 15 of his free throws. ""He's so locked in,"" teammate Gerald Green said. ""He puts the work in. He's leading us in the right direction. Our job is to let him lead and follow him in this. He'll take us where we need to go."" Green added 25 points, and Kenneth Faried had 16 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out with 5:07 remaining. Houston snapped a two-game losing streak, holding the Jazz to 36 percent shooting and forcing 23 turnovers. ""The biggest thing is we turned that ball over way too much,"" Utah guard Donovan Mitchell said. ""That's what really hurt us."" Mitchell had 26 points and nine assists for Utah. Rudy Gobert added 10 points and 13 rebounds. Harden fueled the bulk of a 17-4 run that put Houston up 60-48 with 30.1 seconds left in the first half, making three baskets and four free throws. He punctuated it by scoring on three consecutive possessions. ""It never feels like he's selfish,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""It just feels like he's making the right play all the time and a lot of times the right play is him shooting the ball. He's playing at a level that is rare.""

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  On a night when Sacramento's Buddy Hield set a career-high for 3-pointers, teammate De'Aaron Fox felt that Hield's two dunks were just as important. It's something Fox wants to see more of, too, as the Kings continue to push to end their 13-year playoff drought. Hield scored 34 points and made seven 3s, and Sacramento weathered a fourth-quarter flurry from Jimmy Butler to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 115-108 on Saturday night. ""I tell him to do it more just to be able to get to the free throw line more,"" Fox said of Hield's dunks in the first and third quarters. ""When he does it it opens up the game not only for himself but for us as well."" Hield went into the game fourth in the NBA for 3-point percentage and had another outstanding game from the perimeter while going 7 of 13 beyond the arc. That gave Hield 180 this season, topping his previous best of 176 in 2017-18. He also showcased an improved mid-range jumper while trying to make more of an emphasis to drive to the basket as well. ""It's getting easy ones to get myself going and it's keeping the defense honest,"" Hield said. ""Just trying to make them play on certain areas on the court."" Fox had 19 points and eight assists, Willie Cauley-Stein also scored 19 and Marvin Bagley III added 14 points and 13 rebounds as the Kings won their sixth straight at home. With its third consecutive victory over Philadelphia, Sacramento (27-25) matched its win total from last season. Joel Embiid had 29 points and 17 rebounds for Philadelphia. Butler added 29 points, 18 coming in the fourth quarter when he made two four-point plays. ""It was one one of those games where they kept throwing punches,"" said Ben Simmons, who scored 22. ""We didn't respond the right way."" Hield did most of his scoring in the first half but made a pair of pivotal 3s down the stretch and made three free throws in the final 27 seconds. ""I saw a lot of positives,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We kept our composure down the stretch, made some free throws, contested some shots without fouling and got rebounds."" Two days after beating two-time defending NBA champion Golden State, the Sixers struggled from the perimeter and couldn't get much going offensively until the fourth quarter. Embiid shot 9 of 24 while Philadelphia went 7 of 33 beyond the arc. The Sixers led 2-0 on the first of five dunks from Ben Simmons but didn't lead again until Butler's four-point play put them ahead 98-97 with 4:35 remaining. The two teams traded buckets before the Kings closed on an 11-5 run. Hield had six points as part of the surge while Cauley-Stein had three. Philadelphia played without JJ Redick and Wilson Chandler. ""What you realize is we need a healthy team,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""You're not fighting with your whole arsenal and you need to. There's not much wriggle room as it sits."" TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia shot 1 of 13 on 3s in the first half. ... Wilson Chandler was held out with a strained right quad which he injured Thursday against Golden State. ... JJ Redick was given the night off. Kings: Fox left the game briefly in the third quarter and was taken to the locker room after getting hit in the eye. He later returned. ... Bagley's double-double was his eighth this season. The second overall pick continues to come off the bench for Dave Joerger's team. PLAYOFF CHATTER The Kings are in ninth place in the West, 1 1/2 games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final playoff spot. Getting Sacramento to the postseason for the first time since the 2005-06 season is an increasing focal point for the Kings players. ""If we were in the East we'd probably be the fifth or sixth seed,"" Hield said. ""Everybody's still doubting us but we believe in ourselves and we're going to keep believing."" HE SAID IT ""All of a sudden he just sort of exploded and really carried us. He was excellent defensively and offensively as we saw by the bottom line numbers.""

"NEW YORK --  Marc Gasol was conducting his postgame interviews when his cellphone began buzzing with a call from his agent. Gasol declined to answer. If it was trade news, it could wait until after he was done talking basketball. ""I'm not in the mood right now,"" Gasol said, smiling. ""I still want to enjoy this."" Especially because his team had just looked like the Memphis Grizzlies of old. Mike Conley scored 25 points, Gasol had 24 and Memphis snapped a nine-game road losing streak with a 96-84 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. Memphis had lost three in a row and 17 of its last 19 overall but didn't allow more than 22 points in a quarter Sunday in a performance that used to be the norm when the Grizzlies were a perennial playoff team, not one that could be preparing for a rebuild. ""This showed that we still have that, have that core grit-grind kind of mentality regardless of how we've been playing,"" Conley said. Conley added eight rebounds and seven assists in a strong return to the lineup after missing a game with left knee soreness. Gasol chipped in nine rebounds in what could have been the longtime teammates' final road game with the Grizzlies. The team has fallen from playoff contention after a strong start and told the players it will listen to offers for both ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline. Conley and Gasol both acknowledged it's been hard not to think about their futures in recent days. ""When we play together, we know the things that we can do,"" Gasol said. The Grizzlies have one more game before the deadline, at home Tuesday against Minnesota. Justin Holiday added 19 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 16 in the Grizzlies' first road victory since Dec. 23 at the Lakers. Kevin Knox scored 17 points and DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who lost their 13th straight overall and 14th in a row at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks started Dennis Smith Jr. and Jordan in their first game in uniform since coming to New York from Dallas along with Wesley Matthews on Thursday in the Kristaps Porzingis trade. Smith made the first basket of the game, but the Knicks -- with the newcomers not having practiced with the team yet -- shot just 38 percent against one of the league's best defensive teams. ""They don't know anything. They don't know any of our stuff,"" coach David Fizdale said. ""I thought the new guys came in and did a solid job."" Smith finished with eight points and six assists. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Jackson had also missed the previous game with a right quadriceps injury. ... The Grizzlies signed forward Bruno Caboclo to a second 10-day contract Sunday. He started and was scoreless. Knicks: Smith, Jordan and Matthews played their second straight game at MSG but for two different teams. Dallas won here on Wednesday night, when Smith had his second career triple-double. ... Matthews was 2 for 8 for five points. ... Fizdale split two meetings this season against the team he formerly coached. THAT'S DENNIS, NOT ENES Enes Kanter thought he was getting a chance to play in the second quarter, walking from the bench toward the scorer's table as fans cheered. Assistant coach Keith Smart actually wanted Smith, so Kanter returned to his seat as the cheers quickly turned to boos. ""He did say Dennis and I looked at him, I looked at the other players. They're looking at me. I am like, `OK, I guess he called my name,' and then I got up,"" Kanter said. ""I just walked in there and they said nope, sit down. The crowd was like, `Ugh."" NOAH IN NEW YORK Joakim Noah was booed nearly every time he touched the ball in his first game at Madison Square Garden since his failed run here that ended with him banished from the team after an argument with former coach Jeff Hornacek. Noah, who had been given a $72 million, four-year deal by Phil Jackson to return to his hometown, was eventually waived and signed with the Grizzlies. Noah, who scored four points, felt the Knicks underachieved while he was here. ""I take some blame. I didn't perform to what I was capable of, even though I had a lot of injures, I had a lot going on outside the court,"" Noah said. ""So it's disappointing. It's definitely something I have to live with.""","401071460"
"Paul George praises Russell Westbrook amidst criticism for his shooting struggles and says Oklahoma City has found its offensive identity. (1:55) BOSTON --  Eight days after letting a win slip away against the Golden State Warriors, the Celtics were able to finish the job against another tough Western Conference opponent. Kyrie Irving had 30 points and 11 assists as Boston overcame big games from Oklahoma City stars Paul George and Russell Westbrook to snap the Thunder's seven-game win streak in a 134-129 thriller on Sunday. Boston has won four straight since a 115-111 home loss to the Warriors on Jan. 26 and has won nine of its last 10 games overall. ""We battled against Golden State, but (this is) a good win,"" said Al Horford, who had 17 points and nine assists. ""This team has been playing really well and it's just good to get this win here at home."" Marcus Morris had 19 points, Marcus Smart added 18 and seven assists and Daniel Theis had 14 off the Celtics bench. George scored 37 points and Russell Westbrook notched his sixth straight triple-double and 19th of the season with 22 points, 16 assists and 12 rebounds. ""We just played a good team,"" George said. ""I thought they made some big plays, big shots. Gotta live with it."" Steven Adams and Dennis Schroeder each had 16 points for Oklahoma City, and Jerami Grant scored 15. Oklahoma City suffered its first loss since a 138-128 overtime setback against the Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 17. Westbrook made two free throws to pull Oklahoma City within 127-125 with 45.9 seconds remaining after Boston had led by six with 1:27 to go. Irving's driving finger-roll with 23.3 seconds left put Boston up by four, but Grant answered with a 3-pointer to bring the Thunder within 129-128. Oklahoma City squandered a chance to take the lead after Jayson Tatum missed one of two free throws. Irving stripped Westbrook with 8.1 seconds on the clock and Horford got the ball back to Tatum, who sealed the win at the line. ""In a (tight) game like that, I've just got to take care of the ball, so that's on me,"" Westbrook said. Irving said ""instincts"" led him to gamble on his steal of Westbrook. ""It's winning time,"" Irving said. ""I feel like when the ball's in my hand, I've just got to make the right play. Being down the stretch, just trying to make the right decisions."" TIP-INS Thunder: George has made at least two 3-pointers in 31 straight games. ... Oklahoma City enjoyed its best offensive month in franchise history in January, averaging 120.6 points and 44.1 made field goals while going 9-5. ... F Abdel Nader (illness) did not play in his return to Boston. Nader, a 2016 second-round draft pick of the Celtics, averaged 3.0 points in 48 games as a rookie last season with Boston.

C/F Robert Williams (back tightness) also sat and is considered day-to-day. THE BIG THREE Irving, George and Westbrook combined for 89 points in the nationally-televised affair that served as a warm-up act for the Super Bowl. ""Going against the best is always a great challenge,"" Irving said. ""You just want to stay consistent in this game. That's how you get respect. That's all I really care about, getting wins."" THUNDEROUS RESPONSE Oklahoma City began the season with four straight losses, the last a 101-95 home defeat by Boston on Oct. 25. ""They're 33-14 since, which is as good as anybody in the league and they look like that,"" Stevens said before tipoff. SUPER SUNDAY Patriots fans who didn't travel to Atlanta to watch New England face the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl made their presence felt at TD Garden. A sea of Tom Brady jerseys, ""Beat LA"" T-shirts and Pats-related signs accented the crowd. One fan shown on the video board wearing a Rams' Todd Gurley jersey was soundly booed. Before last year's Super Bowl, Stevens wore a hoodie after the Celtics game in honor of Patriots coach Bill Belichick. He stuck with his usual wardrobe this time -- because the Patriots lost a year ago. ""I'm not superstitious as a coach,"" Stevens said. ""I'm superstitious as a fan.""","401071461"
"TORONTO --  The rested Toronto Raptors made quick work of the weary Los Angeles Clippers. Kawhi Leonard scored 18 points, Serge Ibaka had 16 points and 12 rebounds and the Raptors beat the Clippers 121-103 on Sunday for their 10th victory in their last 11 home games. Before the game, Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers bemoaned the lack of rest his team got following a 5 p.m. start Saturday in Detroit, in which the Clippers erased a 25-point deficit to beat the Pistons 111-101. ""This is a ridiculous back-to-back,"" Rivers said. After watching his team trail by double digits throughout the second half, Rivers said he decided not to push his players and risk injuries. ""I felt like this was probably going to be a second-half game for us, you know, if we could keep within string distance and maybe steal it in the second half, but we just didn't have anything,"" he said. ""That's why I took guys out. ""We had dead legs. I thought you could see it defensively, we weren't moving our feet. It was one of those schedule losses, really. I thought it was going to be a tough night and it was."" Clippers guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said fatigue was ""definitely"" a factor in the outcome. ""It's hard to play a whole other 48 minutes in less than 24 hours,"" the rookie said. Gilgeous-Alexander, born in nearby Hamilton, had 19 points to lead Los Angeles. ""He came in and played great,"" Rivers said. ""He was the bright spot."" Lou Williams had 18 points as the Clippers lost for the third time in four games. Toronto improved to 8-0 when playing with at least one day of rest and facing an opponent playing the second game of a back-to-back. The Raptors are 4-0 at home in such games. ""That's a good stat,"" Wright said. ""I guess we're taking advantage of that."" Ibaka has a career-best six straight double-doubles, Toronto's longest streak since Chris Bosh had eight in November 2009. Pascal Siakam and C.J. Miles each had 15 points, and Delon Wright added 14.

"DETROIT --  For the second straight game, the Detroit Pistons had a big third-quarter lead at home. This time, they kept pouring it on. Andre Drummond scored 14 of his season-high 27 points in the third and the Pistons snapped Denver's six-game winning streak, beating the Nuggets 129-103 on Monday night. Detroit blew a 25-point lead in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, but the Pistons never allowed Denver to make much of a run in the second half. Blake Griffin added 17 points for Detroit, and Reggie Jackson scored 14. ""Played with the same energy we had in that Clippers game, but sustained it for the full game,"" Drummond said. ""That last game really hurt."" Trey Lyles had 20 points for the Nuggets, who dropped out of a tie with Golden State for the best record in the Western Conference. Denver was without forward Paul Millsap, sidelined by right ankle soreness, and the Nuggets were also missing Gary Harris (right adductor strain) and Jamal Murray (left ankle sprain). Denver looked sharp early, scoring 36 points in the first quarter, but the Nuggets managed only 19 in the second and trailed 68-55 at halftime. ""Regardless of how many bodies we had, we didn't defend at all,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""Andre Drummond completely dominated us all game. He's an outstanding player, but 14 points and eight rebounds is a really good game for most players, and he had that in the third quarter."" Drummond's work was done after three quarters. None of the Pistons' starters played in the fourth, and the backups extended the lead. Detroit's collapse against the Clippers began toward the end of the third, but that didn't happen this time. The Pistons were up 97-83 after three. Stanley Johnson then opened the fourth with a three-point play and a 3-pointer, and Luke Kennard added a 3 of his own to push the lead to 23. DEPTH Detroit's bench was outscored 80-17 in the loss to the Clippers, but the Pistons turned that around in a big way against the short-handed Nuggets. Detroit's reserves finished with a 60-28 edge. Johnson scored 21 points, and Langston Galloway added 18 for the Pistons. Kennard finished with 14. ""Tonight our bench was huge,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said.

"WASHINGTON --  As the old man on an Atlanta squad jammed with youngsters, Vince Carter knew what challenges the longest road trip of the season would present. Now he's the reason the Hawks are heading home on a rare high. The 42-year-old Carter scored 16 points in 16 minutes after halftime, helping Atlanta hold off the Washington Wizards 137-129 on Monday night to complete their seven-game trip with four wins. ""We've never been in a situation where we've played two weeks. Everybody is tired,"" said Carter, 12 years removed from his eighth and most recent All-Star appearance. ""And we find a way to close a road trip and we didn't lay down."" With center John Collins exiting at halftime due to a cut on his face, Carter came on midway through the third quarter to a notable ovation from the Washington crowd and promptly hit his first three shots -- including two 3-pointers. He finished 6 of 8 from the floor and 4 of 6 from beyond the arc to help the Hawks stay up by multiple possessions throughout the second half after nearly giving back a 19-point advantage in the first. ""He knew John was out,"" said Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce, whose team was 6-19 on the road prior to this trip. ""He knew we needed every boost that we could get from another guy, and he was that guy tonight. It's just a lot of fun as a fan. I think the fans here started rooting for Vince regardless of who they were really rooting for."" Taurean Prince scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and rookie Kevin Huerter added 19 points for the Hawks. Each hit five of Atlanta's 20 3-pointers. Collins finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds, Omari Spellman had 16 points and 10 rebounds, and Trae Young added 10 points and 10 assists. Nine players reached double figures for the Hawks, who outrebounded Washington 51-39 and finished 20 of 41 from behind the arc. ""Our whole team (is) probably just ready to get home,"" said Huerter, who hit two 3s during an early 16-2 run that put Atlanta up 28-16 late in the first quarter. Bradley Beal had 18 of his 27 points in the fourth for the Wizards, who slipped into a 10th-place tie with Orlando in the Eastern Conference playoff race, three games back of eighth-place Miami. Jeff Green scored 26 points, Trevor Ariza had 25 and Jordan McRae added a season-high 20 off the bench for Washington, which has 29 games left to make up ground. ""We've got to use these to our advantage to try to put ourselves in a position to get in the playoffs, and I think we will,"" Green said. HUERTIN' FOR HOME In Huerter's second game in Washington, fewer than 10 miles from where he played college ball at Maryland, he started quickly before a crowd that included several former teammates.

"NEW YORK --  They already had the NBA's best record, so Giannis Antetokounmpo knew the Bucks were a good team. A powerful finish to a five-game road trip showed him they might be even better than that. ""To finish our road trip with four wins in a row says a lot about this team and how great it can be,"" Antetokounmpo said. Antetokounmpo had 30 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists, and Milwaukee beat the cold-shooting Brooklyn Nets 113-94 on Monday night. The injury-depleted Nets missed 19 of their first 20 3-point attempts, making it another easy night for the team with the league's top record. Brooklyn finished 5 for 42 (11.9 percent) behind the arc and had its nine-game home winning streak snapped. Malcolm Brogdon added 16 points and Eric Bledsoe had 15 for the Bucks, who won their fourth straight -- all by double digits -- after dropping the first game of the trip in Oklahoma City. The teams entered with the two best records in the East since Dec. 7, with the Bucks coming in 22-6 and Brooklyn 20-8. But the Nets were minus a lot of the firepower that produced that strong stretch. ""Brooklyn's really banged up so it's almost not fair, but for us at the end of a road trip it's a good win,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. D'Angelo Russell scored 18 points for the Nets, who have been forced to go deep down their roster because of injuries and lost their third in a row. Brooklyn shot 32 percent overall while playing without Caris LeVert, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jared Dudley and Allen Crabbe, all either starters or key reserves. ""We obviously have some guys out and some guys back and are mixing and matching,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I like what we do offensively. Sure we can move it better, but it's tough when you're not making shots."" The remaining Nets were no match for the Bucks, especially with Shabazz Napier going 0 for 10 behind the arc and DeMarre Carroll missing his first eight overall before finishing 2 for 11. ""It just seemed like everything that we did, they had a plan for it. They just played their butts off defensively,"" Brooklyn center Jarrett Allen said. Despite all that, the Nets trailed by only nine at halftime. It was nearly 11, but Antetokounmpo's basket was ruled too late after he picked up an inbounds pass with three seconds left near one foul line and got all the way to the other basket to attempt a layup. But the Bucks broke out for 36 points in the third quarter, extending their lead to 87-64. TIP-INS Bucks: Bledsoe missed Saturday's game at Washington with a sore Achilles tendon. ... Antetokounmpo was the Eastern Conference player of the week last week for the second consecutive week. He has won the award six times this season. Nets: Atkinson said LeVert (dislocated right foot) and Crabbe (sore right knee) would practice with the Nets' G League affiliate on Tuesday. Atkinson said he wasn't sure yet if they would be able to get into games before the All-Star break. ... The Nets signed F Mitch Creek to a second 10-day contract. DRAFT STRATEGY Antetokounmpo, as the highest vote-getter among fans in the East, will draft one of the All-Star rosters Thursday. LeBron James has the first pick, so Antetokounmpo said he hasn't made a list of who he wants because James can get them first in the first round. But he did say he's leaning toward Stephen Curry with his first pick. ""I might pick Steph because he picked me first last year and I've got to return the favor,"" Antetokounmpo said. BACKCOURT BOOST Besides LeVert and Crabbe, the Nets are also without Dinwiddie (right thumb surgery) and Harris (sore right hip). So Atkinson said the nearing returns of some regulars is ""good timing."" ""Listen, it doesn't have to be 40 minutes, right?"" Atkinson said. ""I think that would be kind of the best scenario, just kind of integrating those guys slowly into the lineup. That's going to be a big boost for us. I think right now, like I said, it's good timing."" IN THE CROWD Former President Bill Clinton and Brooks Koepka, last year's U.S. Open and PGA Championship winner, were in attendance.","401071465"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Darren Collison came through with the kind of late-game heroics fans in New Orleans hoped to see when they welcomed him to the Big Easy as a 2009 first-round draft choice. All the more reason for the Indiana Pacers to be glad Collison plays for them now. Collison scored 22 points, highlighted by his 3-pointer and 20-foot jumper over 6-foot-11 center Jahlil Okafor during the final two minutes, and the Pacers held off the depleted Pelicans 109-107 on Monday night. ""It's always good memories of when I first got drafted,"" Collison said. ""And coming back here, you always want to have a good game against the team that drafted you."" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said his team might need Collison to play that way all the time, now that leading scorer Victor Oladipo is out for the remainder of the season following recent knee surgery. Collison ""is capable of doing that,"" McMillan said. ""He made some big shots tonight and he is the guy we've gone to as far as late in games, putting the ball in his hands."" Domantas Sabonis had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and Myles Turner added 15 points and nine rebounds for the Pacers, who won their second straight. The Pelicans had the ball, down 109-106, in the final seconds after Indiana guard Aaron Holiday was called for an offensive foul. But just before Jrue Holiday started to pull up for a 3-pointer, Pacers guard Corey Joseph astutely committed a reach-in foul, putting the Pelicans' guard on the foul line for just two free throws with two seconds left. Holiday made the first and purposely missed the second, but the Pelicans were unable to get the rebound they needed in order to attempt a tying shot. Playing without five of their most productive players -- including disgruntled All-Star Anthony Davis -- the Pelicans have lost three straight. Each loss has been by six or fewer points to teams currently occupying playoff positions in the standings. Okafor had 25 points and 13 rebounds for New Orleans. Jrue Holiday added 19 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Cheick Diallo had 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Pelicans, who outrebounded the Pacers 55-43. Ian Clark added 18 points and Darius Miller 16, but New Orleans missed 29 of 38 attempts from 3-point range. ""If we would have knocked down half our 3s, it would have been a different game,"" Jrue Holiday said, adding that he's seen ""a lot of encouraging things"" during the Pelicans' recent performances. ""A lot of us play very, very hard and we try to play together,"" Holiday continued. ""We make little mistakes here and there, but that's a part of growing with each other."" TIP-INS Pacers: Bojan Bogdanovic and Thaddeus Young each scored 14. ... Former Pelicans forward Tyreke Evans scored nine points and said a few words after one basket to former teammate Davis, who was on the bench in street clothes and laughed as Evans jogged past him. ... Aaron Holiday, who periodically was matched up against his brother, had eight points. ... F Doug McDermott missed his second straight game with bruised ribs. Pelicans: Coach Alvin Gentry said Davis, who last week asked to be traded, has been ""cleared to practice"" as he recovers from a sprained left index finger that has sidelined him since the end of a loss at Portland on Jan. 18. ... Gentry said he hopes by Wednesday that New Orleans' more prominent regulars will return to the lineup. For the fourth straight game, the Pelicans played without not only Davis, but also forwards Julius Randle (right ankle sprain) and Nikola Mirotic (right calf strain), as well as guards Elfrid Payton (right ankle sprain) and E'Twaun Moore (bruised left quadriceps). WORDS OF ENCOURGAMENT Collison said he told Gentry, who was a Los Angeles Clippers assistant when Collison played for that club, that ""I appreciate how he's handling things"" in New Orleans amid the uncertainly caused by Davis' trade request. ""A lot of things (are) going on over there and it seems like they're playing hard every night,"" Collison said. ""They made it competitive tonight. Jrue's trying to carry that team and they're trying to be scrappy, just like us.""","401071466"
"PHOENIX --  Another 40-point game for James Harden. That makes 20 of them this season. The reigning MVP scored 44 points and the Houston Rockets beat Phoenix 118-110 on Monday night to hand the Suns their season-worst 11th straight loss. Harden joined Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan and Rick Barry as the only players with 20 games of at least 40 points in the first 50 of a season. Harden, who also had eight rebounds and six assists, extended his streak of games with at least 30 points to 27, third-longest in NBA history. The only longer streaks are 65 and 31 games, both by Chamberlain. ""I'm just trying to keep going. Nothing can slow me down,"" Harden said. ""Nothing can stop me. I'm trying to give that same motivation to my teammates and it's not about scoring, it's about attacking the game, being aggressive with the game of basketball -- defensively, offensively. That's all I can give to them."" Chris Paul scored 18 and Kenneth Faried had 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Rockets, who were without two starters. Josh Jackson scored 25 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. 23 and Devin Booker 19 for the Suns. Deandre Ayton added 15 points and 11 boards. Booker left in the fourth quarter with a tight hamstring. The Suns never led but stayed close through the first half before falling behind by 20 in the third quarter. Phoenix cut it to single digits on several occasions in the fourth only to be thwarted by a basket from Harden or Paul. Harden scored 14 in the final quarter. Up by six at halftime, the Rockets opened a big lead in the third quarter. Harden sank a 3-pointer from the corner and Faried dunked a rebound to cap a 13-4 run that put Houston up 84-68. The Rockets boosted the lead to 20 three times in the quarter, the last at 94-74 on Paul's two free throws with 1:02 left. But the Suns finished the period on a 6-0 spurt as Oubre's 3-pointer at the buzzer cut the Rockets' advantage to 94-80 entering the fourth. The run reached 10-0 when Phoenix scored the first four of the final quarter, making it 94-84 on Oubre's dunk with 10:57 to play. Harden sank a pair of 3s in an 8-0 run and Houston led 101-88 with 7:05 remaining. The Suns kept it close in the first half, despite Harden's 22 points, five assists and five rebounds. Harden scored inside twice to ignite a 9-2 spurt that put Houston up 50-42 on Paul's wide-open 3 with 6:03 left in the half.  Austin Rivers' 3 gave Houston its biggest lead of the half, 57-46, with 3:21 left. The Rockets led 63-57 at the break. The Suns tried a new defensive strategy on Harden and, overall results notwithstanding, it worked pretty well some of the time. ""James forces teams to do a coverage that you usually don't do,"" Booker said. ""It was new for us, first time to do it. ... I feel we did pretty well, kept it close, (were) in striking distance most of the game."" KOBE'S TAKE Harden more or less agreed with Kobe Bryant's comments that the Rockets won't win a title with Harden dominating the ball so much. Harden doesn't expect to have to do that when the playoffs come around. ""I have to ball-dominate with all of the injuries,"" he said. ""We have had the injuries throughout the course of the year. Right now he is probably right. This way that we are playing won't happen in the playoffs, won't get us where we want to go, but we haven't had a full roster. Yet I am excited for that to come."" TIP-INS Rockets: Through 50 games, Harden has 658 3-point attempts, seventh-most for an entire season in NBA history. ... Houston was without Eric Gordon (right knee soreness) and Clint Capela (right thumb injury). ... Five former Suns are on the Rockets' roster: P.J. Tucker, Gerald Green, Marquese Chriss, Brandon Knight and Danuel House Jr. That's not counting Rivers, waived by the Suns immediately after he and Oubre came over from Washington in a trade for Trevor Ariza. Suns: Phoenix again didn't have T.J. Warren (right ankle soreness) and De'Anthony Melton (right ankle sprain). ... The Suns have lost 10 straight at home to Houston. They last beat the Rockets in Phoenix on April 15, 2013.","401071467"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Marvin Bagley III signaled for the ball, caught a lob from Yogi Ferrell and nearly did a full 360-degree turn in the air before dunking it. It was just the latest highlight during an impressive run for Sacramento's emerging rookie star. Bagley's alley-oop slam was his biggest play on a night when he had a career-high 24 points and 12 rebounds, leading the Kings past the San Antonio Spurs 127-112 on Monday for their seventh straight home win. ""I didn't know what was going to happen,"" Bagley said of his fourth-quarter dunk. ""We were running. He threw it up. Then I jumped, I was thinking about dunking it backwards. I caught it and I turned. It was just one of those things that when it happened in the moment I wasn't really thinking about what I was going to do. I just went up and it happened."" Bagley has posted double-doubles in three straight games and is finding his groove after returning from a knee injury last month. He is showing why the Kings thought highly enough of him to draft him second overall out of Duke last year. ""It's been fun, man,"" he said. ""I'm a totally different person from Game 1. I just feel different. I'm seeing a lot of things differently out there. The game is slowing down."" De'Aaron Fox added 20 points and Buddy Hield scored 18 to extend Sacramento's longest home winning streak since a 14-gamer in 2005-06. That was the last time the Kings made the playoffs, but Sacramento (28-25) is positioned to make a run at a postseason spot this season. The Kings trail the Los Angeles Clippers by a half-game for eighth place in the Western Conference. DeMar DeRozan had 24 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 for the Spurs, who lost the opener of their annual eight-game rodeo road trip. Sacramento coach Dave Joerger was fearful his team could have a ""hangover"" after an emotional win at home Saturday night against Philadelphia. But the young Kings responded with another victory, helping them seal their first season-series win over the Spurs since 2001-02. Sacramento had lost 14 straight to San Antonio before winning at home in November and followed it up with another. The teams meet for the final time in the regular season March 31 in San Antonio. The Kings started to pull ahead midway through the third quarter. Hield made a driving layup followed by a 3-pointer in transition to build the lead to 91-80, and Sacramento led by 12 heading into the fourth. The Spurs cut the deficit in half early in the fourth but Bagley energized the crowd with an alley-oop dunk when he rotated nearly 360 degrees after catching the lob from Ferrell to help stave off a comeback attempt. The Kings made seven 3-pointers and had 20 fast-break points in the first quarter to take a 14-point lead before the Spurs fought back in the second to briefly go back ahead. Fox's buzzer-beating layup put Sacramento up 63-59 at halftime. ""They got the crowd involved, got into transition, and they didn't slow down after that,"" DeRozan said. ""We just missed a lot of easy shots and didn't have a rhythm all game. And you can tell their comfort level was all the way on the 10. They had it going and we didn't."" TIP-INS Spurs: G Derrick White didn't join the team for the start of the road trip because of a heel injury. ""He'll be out for a while,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""The MRI wasn't great. So we'll see."" Davis Bertans started in place of White. Kings: Sacramento made 10 3-pointers in the first half to extend the franchise record for most games in a season with double-digit 3s. The Kings have done it 41 times this season, seven more than the previous mark set two years ago. ... The Kings outscored the Spurs 60-32 from the bench. FAN FAVORITE Ferrell scored 19 points on 7-for-7 shooting, including four from long range. That performance earned him a long run in the fourth quarter and chants from the crowd. ""That felt pretty good,"" he said. ""I thank them for that. It's pretty cool to have the whole arena chant your name."" BUZZER BEATERS There was a frantic end to the third quarter. Patty Mills missed a shot for San Antonio that Nemanja Bjelica rebounded with 4.1 seconds left. He got the ball to Fox, who went coast-to-coast for a layup with 1.4 seconds to go. But Bertans then threw an outlet pass to Mills, who responded with a layup of his own with 0.2 seconds left in the quarter.","401071468"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Still not quite healed from a shoulder strain he suffered last week, Tobias Harris came up big for the Los Angeles Clippers. Harris scored 34 points, including a running jumper in the lane with 4.3 seconds remaining, and the Clippers rallied from 20 points down to beat the Charlotte Hornets 117-115 on Tuesday night. ""It's as good as it's going to be,"" Harris said of his injured shoulder. ""It's not any better or worse. It's about pushing myself and battling through it, keeping my mental state at a high level to go into a game and be effective."" Lou Williams scored 31 points for the Clippers, Montrezl Harrell added 16 and Patrick Beverley 15. Los Angeles, playing its third road game in four days, shot 18 for 24 (75 percent) on 3-pointers. Charlotte had a chance to tie or take the lead on its last possession, but struggled to inbound the ball and Marvin Williams' 3-point attempt at the buzzer was short. ""That wasn't what we were looking for,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""I could have come up with something better."" Kemba Walker scored 32 points and Jeremy Lamb added 22 for the Hornets. Marvin Williams finished with 13 points and Malik Monk had 12. It was the second time this season Charlotte lost a game after leading by 20. The Hornets lost 126-121 to New York on Dec. 14 after leading by 21. ""There are a lot of teams that when they're up 20, they win the game,"" Lamb said. ""There are times when you're down 20 that you lose, or you're down 20 and you make a run. A 20-point lead in the NBA has always been something that's not safe."" Beverly's loose-ball foul with 21.1 seconds left put Marvin Williams on the line for Charlotte. Williams hit both to tie it at 115. The Hornets led 88-68 on a Miles Bridges 3-pointer with 3:17 to play in the third. Walker, held to 13 in a Clippers win this season, had 25 by halftime -- but just seven in the second half. The Clippers kept the ball from getting anywhere close to him for the final shot. ""We thought, `deny,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We did not want him to catch the ball, and we had already decided that we were not going to trap because we didn't want anyone getting the open 3-pointer. We said `at all costs, if we can deny him the ball, deny him the ball."" TIP INS Clippers: Los Angeles held Walker to 13 points in their first matchup this season, a 128-109 win. Walker scored 25 on 8-of-15 shooting (4 for 6 on 3s) in the first half Tuesday. ... Danilo Gallinari (back) did not play. ... The Clippers' third-period woes continued as they were outscored 34-31. Hornets: Center Cody Zeller, who missed 16 games after surgery on his right hand, entered the game at the 6:43 mark of the first period with a small brace on his hand, but didn't wear it in the second half. He finished with 11 rebounds.  ... Tony Parker left after 9 minutes on the court with a back injury and didn't return. . Marvin Williams tied a career high with four blocked shots. UNREAL SHOOTING NIGHT The Clippers kept a gaudy 3-point shooting percentage throughout and it didn't fade away late. Late in the third, it was 77 percent. ""I was like, are we really shooting 77 percent?"" Harris said. ""But we were. We should just be pulling up from anywhere at that point."" IMPRESSIVE MOVE Late in the first half, Walker picked up a loose ball on the Clippers' end. Teammate Bismack Biyombo fell to the court also the ball. Walker, with the ball still in play, helped Biyombo up before turning up court on the dribble, prompting a surprised smile from Biyombo.

"CLEVELAND --  Gordon Hayward finally got some closure at Quicken Loans Arena. He walked off the floor. Making his first visit to Cleveland since suffering a horrific broken left ankle in his debut for Boston in 2017, Hayward scored 18 points as the Celtics beat the Cavaliers 103-96 on Tuesday night for their fifth straight victory despite missing All-Star guard Kyrie Irving. A strained left hip prevented Irving from facing his former team, but Jayson Tatum helped make up for his absence with 25 points. Marcus Smart had 17 and Jaylen Brown finished with 13. Hayward came off the bench and made 9 of 14 shots and added six rebounds and five assists in 30 minutes. The 28-year-old admitted being nervous about coming back to where his leg grotesquely snapped as he jumped to catch a lob pass in his first game after signing as a free agent with the Celtics. His season was over in just five minutes, and Hayward was taken off the floor on a stretcher. ""I told my wife I was a little anxious about it for sure sitting in my hotel room last night,"" Hayward said. ""Just thinking about how everything changed and where I was sitting a year ago from now.  Just happy to try to find some perspective, I guess. Just happy that I was out there."" Rookie Collin Sexton scored 27 -- but none in the fourth quarter -- for the Cavs, who dropped to 3-20 since Dec. 19. Alec Burks, who has been linked to recent trade talks, added 21 for Cleveland. Larry Nance Jr. had 11 points and 12 rebounds. The struggling Cavs were still within 94-91 when Smart hit a pull-up jumper, and after a miss by Sexton, dropped a 3-pointer. Burks had a monster dunk and 3 to make it 101-96, but Tatum blocked a shot by Ante Zizic underneath and Tatum closed it out by making a pair of free throws with 1:35 remaining. Without Irving and starting forward Marcus Morris (sore right knee), the Celtics needed someone to pick up the scoring slack and make plays down the stretch, and Tatum came through at both ends. ""We're super confident with this lineup,"" Tatum said. ""We're young, but we were very battle tested last year together in the playoffs."" Celtics coach Brad Stevens was sure the Cavs would give his team all it could handle. ""Everybody just looks at records and makes assumptions that things are easy and they're not,"" Stevens said. ""It's hard to win. That team over there is playing hard. We were lucky to be where we were at halftime. You knew at the start of the third quarter it was going to be back and forth the rest of the way. "" TIP-INS Celtics: Irving has missed three of Boston's four visits since the Cavs traded him. ... Stevens said reserve center Aron Baynes (bruised foot) will be out through the All-Star break. He said Morris' injury is not a ""long-term"" thing and it's possible he'll play Thursday. ... F Daniel Theis was called for a rare, punching-the-ball violation while going after an offensive rebound in the fourth quarter. Cavaliers: F Cedi Osman missed his first game since rolling his right ankle on Saturday against Dallas. Osman averages 12.6 points. ...

IRVING UPDATE Stevens said Irving, who is averaging a team-high 23.8 points per game, may return on Thursday when Boston hosts LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, hours after the NBA's trade deadline. ""I would hope he would be able to go, but I don't know for sure,"" Stevens said. ""We'll know more tomorrow."" RACING ROOKIE Sexton came out in attack mode, scoring 18 points in the first half on 8-of-13 shooting. He cooled down after halftime and missed all five shots in the fourth quarter. Still, it was a strong performance to build upon. ""The last game I missed like six layups that I usually make, so that was one thing I've continued to work on this week,"" he said. ""Teams have been daring me to shoot and I got to knock it down for my teammates."" TRADE TALK Burks has already been traded once this season -- Cleveland got him from Utah in the Kyle Korver deal -- and he's not concerned about chatter that he'll be dealt again. ""I don't believe in rumors until something happens,"" he said. ""If nothing happens then I'm not going nowhere. If something happens it happens. I enjoy my time here and hopefully it keeps going."" PERFECT FORM Tatum went 12 of 12 from the free-throw line and Boston didn't miss any of its 14 attempts. ""I was just looking to be aggressive and attack the rim from the beginning,"" Tatum said. ""It's the easiest way to get points, getting to the line.""","401071470"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers have suddenly found a new winning combination. Not even LeBron James could slow it down Tuesday night. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 24 points and the Pacers tied an NBA franchise-record by making 19 3-pointers in a 136-94 rout over the Los Angeles Lakers -- the most lopsided loss James has endured in his 16-year career. ""They scored 33 points off our 19 turnovers and that was from the beginning of the game. We can't play from behind like that,"" James said. ""I think it (the jet lag) hit us. That first game flying across the country looked like it had a lot to do with it, but we didn't come out with the defensive mentality we had the last time we played them and they made us pay for it."" Twice previously James' teams had been blown out by 36: Against Washington in April 2008 and in the 2013 NBA Finals against San Antonio. But this was might go down as the most embarrassing of the three. Indiana led wire-to-wire and never allowed the Lakers to get within single digits after the first basket of the second quarter despite playing without All-Star guard Victor Oladipo and on the tail end of a back-to-back following a four-game trip. At one point, the Pacers led by 46. And after James left with 2:06 remaining in the third quarter, coach Luke Walton wisely kept the four-time MVP him on the bench for the rest of the night. James was not himself either after missing 17 of the previous 18 games with an injured groin. He missed three of his first five shots, was beaten three times early on defense and had five first-half turnovers before finishing with 18 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and six turnovers. JaVale McGee added 16 as the Lakers lost for the sixth time in eight games amid the continuing swirl of trade rumors, something Pacers fans noted by repeatedly chanting ""LeBron's gonna trade you."" ""I know it has to be tough on a lot of our guys -- especially our young guys,"" James said. ""They've just never been a part of it and they're hearing it every single day. I know that the worst thing you could right now is be on social media and I know all young guys love social media. So, that definitely can't help."" The Pacers, meanwhile, remained focused on regrouping. After losing four straight immediately following Oladipo's season-ending knee injury, they've rebounded with three straight wins. On Tuesday, they produced a season-high 69 points in the first half, a season-high single-game total and their widest victory margin of the Eason. They made it look easy, too. After Bogdanovic opened the game by scoring all of the Pacers' points in a 10-2 spurt, the Lakers never recovered. Myles Turner finished with 22 points while Thaddeus Young had 12 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. ""We look at it as another win, but it does feel good,"" Young said. ""It's not really about beating them by 42, but we played a complete game."" TIP-INS Lakers: Played without Lonzo Ball (sprained left ankle) and Josh Hart (left patella tendinitis). ...

New York., featuring a starting lineup with three new players, also lost at home for a franchise-record 15th straight game. ""The second night of a back-to-back, obviously coming off a big win (against Denver) and we got a lot of momentum, too,"" Griffin said. ""It's important to come out and not take any team lightly and come out and just execute, let our execution take care of the game for us."" Reggie Bullock and Reggie Jackson each added 19 points for the Pistons.

The Knicks have played only one such series this season, losing to the Bucks on Dec. 25 and 27.","401071472"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Kyle Lowry doesn't want to play for any team but Toronto. A detour through his hometown is always welcome, though. Lowry had a big first half amid reports that Toronto has offered him in a trade, Kawhi Leonard finished with 24 points, and the Raptors held off the Philadelphia 76ers 119-107 on Tuesday night in a matchup between two of the Eastern Conference's top teams. Lowry, a Philadelphia native and former Villanova star, had 17 points in the first half and finished with 20. He seemed unfazed by a report from Sports Illustrated that Toronto had offered him to Memphis as part of a trade package for Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. ""I personally want to be in Toronto,"" Lowry said. ""I've never asked for a trade. My goal is to try to win a championship here, and that's what I want to do."" Serge Ibaka also had 20 points to help the Raptors overcome the Joel Embiid-led Sixers. Embiid had 37 points and 13 rebounds for his league-leading 44th double-double, while Ben Simmons scored 20 points and Jimmy Butler had 18. With the Sixers trailing by 18 early in the fourth quarter, Embiid ripped off 12 points in a three-minute stretch to slice Toronto's lead to 108-101 with 6:59 left and get the home crowd on its feet for the first time all night. But the Raptors (39-16) never let the Sixers (34-20) get closer than seven. ""Offensively, defensively, they were just better than us,"" Embiid said. ""But I'm proud of our effort in the second half."" After erupting for 40 points in the first quarter behind 11-for-11 shooting from the free-throw line, the Raptors built a 21-point advantage midway through the second quarter. Lowry, who missed Toronto's last game due to back soreness, fueled the run with three 3-pointers in a two-minute stretch. ""He was awesome,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""You know, that's Kyle in a super-focused game. He took his 3s, he took his deep ones, he took some drives. Whenever you see him pull that little slam-on-the-brakes, spin-to-the-left fadeaway, you know he's in the game right."" Lowry added another 3, which bounced all around the rim before dropping in, four minutes before halftime to help Toronto take a 72-55 lead into the break -- the Raptors' best offensive first half of the season. ""I love playing at home,"" Lowry said. ""My mom's in the building. It's different."" TOO MANY MINUTES? The Sixers were without two starters as Wilson Chandler (quad) missed his second straight game while JJ Redick was a late scratch due to nausea. That led to the team's Big 3 of Embiid (42 minutes), Simmons (44 minutes) and Butler (39 minutes) all playing more than coach Brett Brown would have liked. ""We got two days off before we played and I just felt like it was our only chance to win,"" Brown said. ""But it is not an ideal volume of minutes that I played them."" DEFENSE COMES FIRST While the Raptors had a big offensive performance, they were mostly proud of the work they put in on the defensive end. That includes forcing Simmons into six turnovers. ""He's a great player, very good at getting to the basket and finding his teammates,"" Leonard said. ""I just tried my best to get in the passing lane and stick to our game plan."" TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto is now 17-11 on the road this season, the third best mark in the league. The Raptors' next two games will also be away from home. ... Toronto won the season series with Philadelphia, 3-1, with the Sixers' only win coming on Dec. 22 when the Raptors were missing Leonard and Ibaka, their top two scorers. 76ers: Tuesday's game marked the start of a four-game homestand after a 2-2 road swing out West. ... Some of the biggest cheers of the night came in the pregame when Sixers great Allen Iverson rang the team's ceremonial bell at midcourt. ... This was Embiid's NBA-leading 22nd game this season with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds.","401071473"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Mike Conley put together quite a performance in possibly his final game with the Memphis Grizzlies. Conley had 25 points and nine assists, and the Grizzlies beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-106 on Tuesday night on Justin Holiday's two free throws with .1 seconds remaining. Conley and longtime teammate Marc Gasol are being shopped around ahead of Thursday's trade deadline. Gasol was a late scratch amid reports about the Grizzlies being in trade talks. ""They knew what it meant to me and Marc,"" Conley said of the team opening with a 23-4 run and emerging with its second straight win. ""It's just a tough situation all the way around."" Memphis also got 23 points from rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. Ivan Rabb had a career-high 19 points to go along with 11 rebounds, while Holiday finished with 17 points. Karl-Anthony Town had 26 points and 18 rebounds for Minnesota, and Dario Saric finished with 22 points. Luol Deng scored 18. ""We had opportunities to win the game early,"" Minnesota interim coach Ryan Saunders said. ""When you dig yourself a 19-point hole, it's tough to come back from."" Before the Grizzlies could celebrate, they had to survive a late push by the Timberwolves. Towns tied it at 106 when he converted a pair of free throws with 15.7 second left. The game appeared headed to overtime until Holiday was fouled by Josh Okogie in the final second. Holiday converted both free throws for the final margin. Asked what he was thinking at the line, Holiday replied: ""These are money. They were going in. Once they fouled me, I knew the game was over. There was no way I was going to get two chances at it."" As Conley left the floor, he looked around FedExForum before heading to the locker room and slapping hands with fans in the hallway. ""It was a little surreal,"" Conley said, adding he wondered throughout if it possibly was his last game with his only NBA team. ""It would cross my mind almost every timeout,"" he said. ""Look into the crowd. Be looking back at the bench. Looking at coaches and players and seeing my wife and kids in the stands in the same spot they've been in for 12 seasons. It was all just trying to take it all in and enjoy it."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Saric reached double figures for the first time since scoring 11 against Philadelphia on Jan. 15. ... Minnesota made each of its 15 free throws in the first half and finished the game 19 of 20. ... Jerryd Bayless finished with five points, stopping his string of six straight games in double figures. .Towns recorded his 35th double-double of the season. Grizzlies: Rabb's previous career high was 16 on April 4, 2018, against New Orleans. ... Memphis had not won consecutive games since Dec. 23 and 26. .Conley has scored at least 20 points in 31 games this season. GASOL SIGHTING Despite not playing, Gasol came out of the locker room near the midway point of the first quarter and sat on the Memphis bench as fans responded with a standing ovation. ""I think it's obvious (that is) a guy who means a ton to this organization, this fan base, the people in this city and the respect that they have for him,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of the crowd reaction.","401071474"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook is on another one of those runs. The dynamic point guard had 16 points, 16 assists and 15 rebounds in his seventh straight triple-double, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Orlando Magic 132-122 on Tuesday night. Westbrook matched the longest triple-double streak of his career with his 20th of the season and No. 124 overall. He is averaging 20.0 points, 13.2 rebounds and 14.4 assists during the streak, and the Thunder are 6-1 during that span. With Westbrook leading the way, Oklahoma City is averaging 124.6 points in its last seven games. ""He is definitely the reason for that,"" said Paul George, who scored 39 points against Orlando. ""He is the reason we have had the highest (offensive) months in Thunder history. I cannot say enough for the credit he deserves for our offense being at the level it is at."" Dennis Schroder scored 20 points and Jerami Grant had 19 to help the Thunder win for the eighth time in nine games. Evan Fournier scored 25 points for the Magic, and Aaron Gordon added 18 points and 10 assists. The Magic committed 29 fouls and had two players foul out. George made 15 of 16 free throws. ""Well, I think the biggest thing that I'll watch on the film is the fouling,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We're on the road, we score 122 -- and that's with playing a really poor third quarter period. But I thought we played three good quarters, but we're not disciplined enough when people are driving the ball."" Orlando led 69-62 at halftime behind 15 points from Gordon and 58 percent shooting as a team. George scored 18 in the first half for the Thunder. Orlando stretched its lead to 79-67 early in the third quarter, causing the Thunder to call a timeout. Oklahoma City came back strong in a two-minute span. A lob from George to Grant for a two-handed jam cut Orlando's lead to 81-78, and the Magic called a timeout. Westbrook clinched his triple-double on a rebound with 3:33 left in the third quarter. His overall play sparked a 29-10 run that put the Thunder back in front for good. Oklahoma City led 98-92 at the end of the third quarter after making 15 of 24 shots in the period. ""We were getting busted the first half,"" Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson said. ""We just came together, started being aggressive, started making plays."" A steal and 3-pointer by Terrence Ross cut Oklahoma City's lead to 128-122 with 31 seconds to play, but the Thunder held on. Clifford said the Magic simply stopped doing what was working. ""We just -- I don't want to say we revert back or whatever, but we don't always just stay with it,"" he said. ""When you've got a way to play, especially against a team as good as them, you've got to stay with it.""

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Hassan Whiteside found his voice and the Miami Heat got a win. Whiteside had 28 points and 11 rebounds, and took on a vocal role as the Heat snapped a three-game losing streak with a 118-108 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night. ""We heard his voice tonight talking to us on both ends of the floor, talking to us in the huddle. He was engaged,"" teammate Dwyane Wade said. ""His presence was known and when he plays that way, when he is that active, we are a good team."" Wade added 22 points and nine rebounds for Miami in the first of a five-game road trip. CJ McCollum had 33 points including seven 3-pointers for the Trail Blazers, who had won three straight but were coming off a five-day layoff. The loss snapped an eight-game winning streak for Portland at home. Miami led by 15 points heading into the final quarter but Portland rallied with a 9-2 run capped by Seth Curry's 3-pointer that pulled the Blazers to 96-88. Evan Turner's layup and free throw got the Blazers closer. McCollum's 3-pointer closed the gap to 101-100 with 6:54 left. James Johnson answered with a 3 for Miami to momentarily slow Portland's momentum until Meyers Leonard's 3. Whiteside's basket and a pair of free throws from Johnson kept Miami in front 108-103, and the Heat were able to hold off the Blazers the rest of the way. ""McCollum started to get rolling and there wasn't too much more I told the guys we could do,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said about Portland's late rally.  ""We were trapping him, bringing a third guy over and he was still getting in the seasons or getting open behind the arc. In those moments, you don't want to beat yourself. We were competitive and found a way to get a couple of stops and Whiteside had some big rebounds."" Miami was coming off an 0-3 homestand, capped by a 95-88 loss Saturday to Indiana, The Heat had 24 turnovers in the loss. Spoelstra inserted Kelly Olynyk into the starting lineup, replacing Johnson. It was Olynyk's sixth start of the season. Portland was coming off a 132-105 victory at home over the Jazz last Wednesday. Jusuf Nurkic did not play because of right knee soreness, but he started against the Heat. Rodney Hood, acquired by the Trail Blazers in a trade with Cleveland on Sunday, did not play. He arrived in Portland on Monday and had not had a workout with the team. The Heat led by as many as nine points in the opening quarter. Tyler Johnson's layup gave Miami a 56-44 lead with 3:51 left in the first half. Whiteside's free throws stretched the advantage. The Heat were up 55-62 going into the break, paced by Josh Richardson with 16 points. Jake Layman came off the bench and led the Blazers with 16. Whiteside's short jumper gave the Heat a 75-63 lead midway through the third period, making him 7 for 7 from the floor to that point. Portland began to close the gap a bit with McCollum's 3-pointer pulling the Blazers to 77-70 but Miami led 94-79 heading into the final quarter. ""For whatever reason, we didn't seem to have a lot of pop for most of the game,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""I don't know if it was the five days off or what, but it seemed pretty obvious most of the first three quarters, we just didn't make the energy plays, whether it was in transition or defensively."" ADDING HOOD Hood met the media for the first time as a Trail Blazer before the game. He said it was no secret he wanted out of Cleveland, but it was kind of a surprise when he got the call as he was headed to a Super Bowl party. He thought he'd be a deadline deal, and he never expected Portland. The Blazers sent Nik Stauskas, Wade Baldwin and two future second-round picks to the Cavaliers in exchange. ""It's a really good fit for me, personality-wise, game-wise, everything,"" hood said about the move. ""I'm looking forward to a fresh start here."" Stotts said he expects Hood to be available on Thursday when the Blazers host San Antonio. TIP INS Heat: Goran Dragic and Derrick Jones Jr., did not travel with the team. Dragic is recovering from right knee surgery and Jones has missed four games with a bone bruise in his right knee. ... Wade was treated to a standing ovation from many in the Moda Center crowd when he came into the game in the opening period.

""I think it's a great opportunity for Seth to compete against his brother in Charlotte, that's awesome, and for Dame to get another shot at it, it's terrific,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ... Lillard finished with 13 points and 10 assists. ... Layman finished with 25 points.","401071476"
"NEW YORK --  Kenny Atkinson insisted before the game that his Nets didn't need more shooting, even though lately they were only good at missing. The Denver Nuggets sure wouldn't argue with him. D'Angelo Russell had 27 points and 11 assists, and Brooklyn surpassed last season's win total with a 135-130 victory over Denver on Wednesday night. Russell made six of the Nets' 19 3-pointers, one game after they made only five as a team in their poorest shooting performance of the season. ""We broke out of our shooting slump. I think that was evident,"" Atkinson said. ""We really shot the heck out of the ball."" DeMarre Carroll added 18 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for Brooklyn (29-27), which got two key injured players back and snapped a three-game skid. Joe Harris scored 17 points and Treveon Graham had 16, with four 3-pointers. ""Obviously any time you have a game like we did the last outing where we struggled to shoot the ball, it feels good once you start seeing them go in,"" Harris said. ""And then shooting is contagious, so once one guy gets it rolling, it seemed like everybody else was able to find a rhythm and get some good confidence."" Nikola Jokic had 25 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in his 10th triple-double of the season for the Nuggets, who have lost two straight games to fall out of a tie for the Western Conference lead. Mason Plumlee scored a season-high 24 points on 10-for-12 shooting against his former team, and Jamal Murray had 19 points and 11 assists after missing six games with a sprained left ankle. Nuggets coach Michael Malone yanked his starters in the third quarter, when the Nets blew open the game. ""This game is a game of mistakes. You're going to make mistakes, you're going to make shots, things are going to happen,"" he said. ""But when you're out there going through the motions, that is one thing I can't stand to watch and will not stand to watch."" Brooklyn had failed to score 100 in its previous two games and had season lows of 32 percent shooting overall and 11.9 percent (5 for 42) from 3-point range in a 113-94 loss to Milwaukee on Monday. The Nets made 13 of their first 18 attempts from behind the arc against the Nuggets. Harris, who missed the last game with a sore right hip, hit three 3s, and Allen Crabbe came off the bench to hit his first 3-point attempt after missing 26 games with a sore right knee. Looking to bounce back from a 129-103 loss at Detroit on Monday, Denver scored the first eight points and raced to a 16-5 lead. But it was down to five by the end of the first quarter, and it was clear by then it was going to have trouble stopping the Nets. ""We kind of had the lead in the first quarter but I don't know,"" Jokic said. ""Something probably happened in our heads. I don't know. Something happened."" Brooklyn was 7 of 9 from behind the arc in a 42-point second quarter, and then opened the third with a 12-4 run to push the lead to 84-64. TIP-INS Nuggets: Plumlee was 7 for 7 in the first quarter. ... Gary Harris missed his fourth consecutive game with a strained right groin. Paul Millsap missed his second straight with right ankle soreness. ... Malone, a New York native, said his parents would be at the game. His father, Brendan, coached 28 years in the NBA.

Atkinson said Caris LeVert, nearing a return from a dislocated right foot, practiced again with the Nets' NBA G League affiliate. He will be evaluated Thursday. PICK A WINNER Malone will coach Team LeBron in the All-Star Game on Feb. 17. LeBron James will draft his roster for the team on Thursday, and Malone was asked if he will watch when the results are unveiled to see if the captain picked him a good team. ""I think it's hard not to get good players. I mean, it's the 24 best players in the world -- now 26 because of Dirk (Nowitzki) and Dwyane Wade,"" Malone said. ""So I haven't sent LeBron my suggestions. I just hope that we get Nikola Jokic on our team because we really need to go through that game and that weekend with the future of that team."" NETS' PROGRESS Atkinson said surpassing last year's win total was real progress, and the playoff-contending Nets weren't surprised they could snap out of their slump against one of the league's top teams. ""I think we all understand what we can do. We know that we can compete with any team and I thought we were changing that perception about us,"" Crabbe said. ""You're playing the Nets tonight, now I think everybody has an idea that we mean business and I think that we just never stop.""","401071477"
"CHICAGO --  Anthony Davis watched near the end of the bench, looking sharp in a maroon sport coat as he waited to see if the New Orleans Pelicans would grant his wish. The All-Star forward wants to be traded. The Pelicans didn't need him to beat the struggling Chicago Bulls. Julius Randle scored 31 points to lead New Orleans to a 125-120 victory on Wednesday night. Davis was healthy enough to return from a sprained left index finger that has sidelined him since Jan. 18. But the Pelicans opted to hold him out with Thursday's trade deadline approaching. The six-time All-Star has made it known he wants out of New Orleans. He was even fined $50,000 by the NBA after his agent went public with that request. Davis' teammates would hate to see him go. ""Selfishly, I would love to be by him every day like I have been this year,"" fellow Chicago product Jahlil Okafor said. ""At the end of the day I want him to be happy. If I'm being selfish, of course I'm going to say I want you to be my teammate."" Jrue Holiday insisted it won't be awkward if Davis isn't dealt. ""Still a professional, still love having him around,"" Holiday said. ""Again, he's like a brother to all of us. Having him here would be a joy."" Randle scored 19 in a blistering fourth quarter and finished six points shy of his season high. He hit 4 of 6 3-pointers and shot 10 of 18 overall, helping the Pelicans pick up the win after losing six of seven. Holiday and Cheick Diallo each scored 18, and Chicago product Jahlil Okafor finished with 13 points. The Bulls agreed to trade Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis to Washington for Otto Porter Jr. shortly before tipoff. Then, they lost for the 16th time in 18 games. ""Everybody's gotta step up,"" Lauri Markkanen said. ""I thought the guys that played, they played well. We just adjust. Change is always tough, but next man up. It's not the first time. I can't say too much about it."" Markkanen led Chicago with 30 points and 10 rebounds. He tied a season high by nailing 5 of 10 3's. Zach LaVine scored 28, and Kris Dunn added 18 points and eight assists. ""We've got to do the little things,"" Dunn said. ""The little things help us win games, get over the hump, and that's what we have to do. There's some great fans. The journey we've been going through, it's a roller-coaster ride, and they keep showing up to the building. We definitely appreciate that."" Randle hit two 3-pointers in a span of just over a minute in the fourth quarter to make it 113-100 with 4:05 left. LaVine drove for a dunk to cut it to 123-118 with 10.9 seconds remaining, but Randle then hit two free throws to make it a seven-point game.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo called it ""a crazy game."" A little too crazy for the All-Star. Antetokounmpo scored 43 points, Eric Bledsoe had 22 points and 11 assists, and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Washington Wizards 148-129 on Wednesday night for their fifth consecutive victory. ""I think we were just trading baskets at one point,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We're a good team but we're trying to be a great team. ""Even though we scored a lot, we were sloppy. Defensively we have to pick it up a little bit because that's not the face we want to show."" The Bucks shot 60 percent (56 for 93) from the field and placed six players in double figures while becoming the first NBA team with 40 victories. Malcolm Brogdon had 18 points and Khris Middleton finished with 16. Washington trailed by as many as 25 in the first half, but closed to 120-113 on Chasson Randle's layup with 10:22 left. Bledsoe helped finish off the Wizards with 10 points in a quick scoring flurry, including a dunk off a missed free throw by Antetokounmpo. He made a 3-pointer with 7:07 remaining to make it 138-118. Bledsoe's electrifying dunk brought a huge reaction from the Fiserv Forum crowd. ""I just saw Brad (Bradley Beal) talking to the ref,"" Bledsoe said. ""That was my chance to sneak in and try to get a rebound. I didn't know I was going to dunk it. ""I just tried to make a play."" Beal led Washington with 30 points, and Thomas Bryant had 26. Jeff Green finished with 22 points for his fourth straight game with 20 or more. The Wizards (22-32) played without Otto Porter Jr. after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls for Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis and a protected 2023 second-round pick. A person familiar with the negotiations said late Wednesday that Washington had agreed to trade Markieff Morris to New Orleans for Wesley Johnson. There will be draft considerations in the deal as well, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the NBA trade call was pending. Antetokounmpo went 17 for 21 from the field in Milwaukee's highest scoring game of the season. He also had six rebounds, four assists and three steals. But he credited Bledsoe for making the difference. ""He's amazing,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""He's been amazing all year. He came in with a defensive mindset. He was in the passing lanes. He made Bradley Beal take tough shots. He gave us the extra energy and we were able to close the game."" The Bucks (40-13) rolled to 50 points in the first quarter on 20-for-27 shooting. They led 85-65 at the break. It was the highest scoring quarter of the season for Milwaukee. The halftime total was two shy of the franchise record for points in a half set on March 14, 1979, versus the New Orleans Jazz. ""We shot the ball really well,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We mixed in getting to the basket. It was just the normal stuff. We were playing fast a lot of possessions and they were scoring, too. ""It was like an ABA game or something."" WORTH NOTING Ersan Ilyasova broke out of a scoring slump with 12 points for Milwaukee. The reserve forward was 4 for 4 from the field.

"DALLAS --  Harrison Barnes stayed on the bench in the fourth quarter after news broke that the Dallas Mavericks forward had been traded to Sacramento. The seventh-year player lingered on the floor a few extra moments after the game to chat up some Charlotte opponents, then walked through a throng of fans who seemed to want to say goodbye after seeing all the social media activity on their phones during the second half. The makeover of the Mavericks continued even as parts of the blockbuster trade that brought Kristaps Porzingis from the New York Knicks were making their Dallas debuts. Porzingis isn't playing this season as he recovers from a knee injury. Rookie sensation Luka Doncic scored 19 points in his third triple-double, Dorian Finney-Smith had 15 points and 10 rebounds and the Mavericks made another move by dealing Barnes while beating the Hornets 99-93 on Wednesday night. ""That's really the first time I've witnessed it,"" Hornets forward Nicolas Batum said of seeing someone traded during a game. ""During practice, on the plane, bus, stuff like that, yes, that happened to me. But during the game? I have not witnessed that being live."" LeBron James of the Lakers blasted the move in an Instagram post late Wednesday. ""So let me guess this is cool cause they had to do what was best for the franchise right???"" James wrote. ""Traded this man while he was literally playing in the game and had ZERO idea."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 12 points in his first game since leaving the Knicks. Trey Burke went scoreless in four minutes while Courtney Lee didn't play. Barnes, who was traded for Kings forwards Zach Randolph and Justin Jackson, played most of the third quarter before reports of the deal surfaced, scoring seven of his 10 points. He wasn't available in the locker room after the game. Dirk Nowitzki started realizing something was up when Barnes didn't replace him early in the fourth quarter as usual with the 40-year-old playing a limited role in his record 21st season with the same franchise. Since Nowitzki credited Barnes for being a positive influence in his two-plus seasons with the Mavericks, he wasn't surprised that Barnes stuck around after word of the trade got out. ""He's a better man than me,"" said Nowitzki, who scored eight points. ""Everybody else would have bounced out. He's just a genuinely good dude and he's obviously got bonds with some of these players here for life. That's the kind of guy he is."" Kemba Walker had 30 points and a season-high 11 rebounds for the Hornets, who got swept by Dallas after losing to the Mavericks by 38 points at home about a month ago. With NBA Commissioner Adam Silver watching from not far behind the Mavericks bench, Doncic had a spinning layup for a 3-point play with Dallas leading by two and answered a bucket by Batum with a 3 to push the lead to six. The first teenager with multiple triple-doubles, Doncic had 11 assists and 10 rebounds on a rough shooting night (5 of 20, including 2 of 10 from 3-point range).

I have to let the dust settle and figure out who the hell is going to start.""","401071480"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz put away the Phoenix Suns with one impressive finish. Mitchell scored 21 points and Joe Ingles had a career-high 11 assists, leading the Jazz to a 116-88 victory over the lowly Suns on Wednesday night. ""Our communication picked up a lot in the second half,"" Mitchell said. ""That really propelled us to get out in transition. Obviously, hitting shots helps, but we were really doing well on communicating well defensively."" Rudy Gobert added 16 points and 12 rebounds as Utah won for the fifth time in seven games. Ingles and reserve Royce O'Neale each finished with 15 points. Phoenix committed 22 turnovers in its 12th straight loss. Josh Jackson matched his season high with 27 points, and DeAndre Ayton had 20 points and nine rebounds. The Suns closed to 75-71 on a three-point play by Kelly Oubre Jr. with 57.1 seconds left in the third quarter. But the Jazz responded with a 9-0 run. O'Neale's 3-pointer made it 84-71 with 10:58 left. The Jazz led by as many as 28 points in the fourth. ""It's not a three-quarter game,"" said Oubre, who finished with 16 points. ""It's a 48-minute game. We gotta stick with it."" Injuries and a trade that sent Ryan Anderson to Miami for Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington left Phoenix with just 10 available players. ""Fourth quarter we just ran out of gas,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""Didn't find the energy to keep competing."" NOT BAD AT ALL Ingles drove for a layup and assisted on a pair of baskets by Derrick Favors that fueled Utah's decisive run in the second half. ""He has a feel for the pick and roll and just making good reads,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Obviously, he's patient with the ball. Created a lot of good offense in pick-and-roll."" KOKOSKOV RETURNS Kokoskov faced Snyder and the Jazz for the first time since taking over in Phoenix. He was an assistant with Utah from 2015 to 2018 and played a key role in helping the Jazz reach the playoffs in each of his final two seasons in Salt Lake City. ""We loved Igor here,"" Ingles said. ""He was an unbelievable assistant coach. He taught all of our guys something at some point."" Kokoskov feels indebted to Snyder for launching his NBA career and credits him with being a visionary coach who influences how he approaches the game. ""He's my life mentor, not just basketball mentor,"" Kokoskov said. BLOCK PARTY Gobert blocked three shots in his 44th double-double of the year. He has registered two or more blocks in 13 straight games, the longest streak in the NBA this season. FROM DEEP Phoenix went 3 of 17 from 3-point range. The Suns have made a 3-pointer in an NBA-record 1,196 straight games. TIP-INS Suns: G Devin Booker was sidelined by right hamstring tightness. ...

"Chris Paul speaks on the acquisition of Iman Shumpert and the departures of Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss in Houston's latest trade. (0:36) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  James Harden and the Houston Rockets are finding their rhythm at the right time. Looks as if some help is on the way, too. Harden made eight 3-pointers and scored 36 points, helping Houston beat the Sacramento Kings 127-101 on Wednesday night. ""We played very, very well,"" Harden said. ""We're kind of catching a momentum and it feels pretty good. It's even more exciting once we get our full roster back."" The Rockets closed out a four-game trip with their third consecutive victory, and they appeared to be on the verge of adding Iman Shumpert to their array of talented shooters. Gerald Green matched his season high with 25 points, and Eric Gordon scored 20 points. Houston, Sacramento and Cleveland were working on a trade that most notably will move Shumpert from the Kings to the Rockets. Houston is sending Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss to the Cavaliers. Alec Burks -- now traded for the second time this season, after starting the year in Utah -- will go from the Cavaliers to the Kings. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the NBA trade call has not yet been completed. ""Shump is a vet who can help us defensively, ball-handling, shooting,"" Harden said. ""He's been playing very well this season. Once he gets here and gets a couple of practices in, let's go."" Houston has won seven games by 20 or more points this season, including twice on its road trip. ""That's a good trip for us,"" Chris Paul said. ""To get three on this road trip, we're playing the right way."" Sacramento also was working on a trade for Dallas' Harrison Barnes in another deal ahead of Thursday's deadline. The Kings had won three in a row and four of five. Buddy Hield had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Marvin Bagley III added 10 points and 10 boards. ""Tough night,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""We didn't shoot the ball well, they did. It's been a tough couple of hours and an interesting couple of hours."" Sacramento kept Harden off the line, but the reigning NBA MVP still scored almost at will. Harden collected 25 points while helping Houston to a 76-45 halftime lead. He made four 3-pointers during a 19-3 run over the final five minutes of the second quarter. Harden -- the NBA leader in average free-throw attempts -- was limited to two, matching his season low. But he went 13 for 26 from the field. ""Guys set the tone early,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Pretty impressive finish of the road trip. There's just a lot of good things that we did solid."" Things got chippy midway through the fourth when Harden was called for a technical foul after he exchanged words with Sacramento's Frank Mason near midcourt. The Kings struggled to keep up. They trailed by as many as 37 in the second half. TIP-INS Rockets: Paul had 15 points and 11 assists. ... Gordon returned to the lineup after sitting out Monday's win over Phoenix because of right knee soreness. ... Houston is 8-4 without Clint Capela, who is sidelined with a right thumb injury. Kings: Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 13 points while starting in place of Shumpert, who addressed his former Sacramento teammates in the locker room before the game and then left the arena. ... Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph are reportedly being sent to Dallas as part of the trade for Barnes. FARIED'S NIGHT Kenneth Faried had 13 points and 11 rebounds for Houston. He has settled in nicely after signing with the Rockets as a free agent on Jan. 21. He is averaging 16.1 points since joining his third team this season. ""It's always nice to know that, yes, he is a perfect fit,"" D'Antoni said. ""When Clint gets back and (Faried) comes off the bench, he can give us that spurt that we can have 48 solid minutes of high-energy centers running up and down the floor.""","401071482"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Kevin Durant wants everyone to forget the free agency chatter and speculation about where he might play next season, calling it ""unnecessary."" That's still months away and he is trying to win another championship with the Golden State Warriors. The two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP wants no part of any association with the New York Knicks, either, though that has been a destination some consider a possibility for him. KD says enough. ""I don't think about that type of stuff,"" Durant said. ""I have nothing to do with the Knicks. I don't know who traded (Kristaps) Porzingis. They got nothing to do with me, I'm trying to play basketball."" Durant had 23 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, Klay Thompson scored 26 points and the Warriors ran away in the second and third quarters to rout the San Antonio Spurs 141-102 on Wednesday night. The two-time defending champions scored 49 points on 16 assists in the third quarter alone, making 5 of 7 3-pointers. They made 24 of 25 field goals in one blistering stretch spanning halftime -- including 14 straight shots at one point. Durant was right in the middle of the impressive display, and then took a few more shots after the game was over. ""Every time I say something it's getting twisted up and thrown out in so many different publications, try to tear me down with my words that I say,"" Durant said, speaking to the media for the first time in more than a week before cutting short his postgame remarks. ""So when I don't say nothing, it's a problem. I just want to play ball. I want to go to the gym and go home, that's all. Is that a problem?"" Stephen Curry wasn't bad either: He had 19 points, seven assists, five rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. Curry and Co. were so good the starters weren't even needed for the final 12 minutes. Durant and Thompson combined to shoot 20 for 26 in a matchup of the NBA's top teams in 3-point shooting percentage -- the Spurs on top at 40.5 to Golden State's 38.6 going into Wednesday. Curry was 7 of 12 with three 3s. Patty Mills scored 16 points with four 3s for San Antonio in the first game of a back-to-back. The Spurs had their five-game winning streak snapped in a 127-112 loss at Sacramento on Monday, and coach Gregg Popovich rested LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan against Golden State. ""No loads will be managed on our part,"" cracked Warriors coach Steve Kerr. Durant made his first six shots and already had 15 points by the 4:28 mark of the opening quarter. Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins scored 15 points in his eighth game since returning from a nearly yearlong absence recovering from surgery for a ruptured left Achilles tendon. Golden State started the second with a 9-0 run and then used an 11-0 burst over a 1-minute, 28-second span to help open a 66-52 halftime advantage. The Warriors, who had used three different starting lineups in as many games before Wednesday, improved to 6-0 with the lineup of Curry, Cousins, Durant, Draymond Green and Thompson. The Spurs began 10 for 15 and 4 of 7 from deep before missing their next seven shots. ""We played against the best team in the league and we had too many turnovers and too many mistakes,"" guard Marco Belinelli said. HONORING SMITH As part of Black History Month, former Olympic sprint star and civil rights activist Tommie Smith received a custom No. 68 Warriors jersey from former Golden State big man Adonal Foyle.

""I think we've been connected,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Defensively playing good, offensively we've got ball movement and guys are knocking down shots. I felt like we lost a rhythm for a few games. That four-game losing streak, I thought we lost a rhythm. But, we seemed to have found it with the guys that we have out on the floor."" Myles Turner had 17 points and tied his career high with six blocked shots, while Thaddeus Young and Darren Collison each scored 14 points for the Pacers, who won their fourth consecutive game. Montrezl Harrell scored 19 points and Danilo Gallinari had 12 for the Clippers, who have a roster in transition after the NBA's trade deadline. ""It was tough, especially when you're playing against a very good team like Indiana,"" Gallinari said. ""We didn't do a very good job tonight. We started pretty well, but we were not able to keep up for the while game."" The Pacers scored 13 straight during a 17-2 run late in the second quarter to pull away.

Indiana led 71-53 at halftime. The Pacers led by as much as 27 when Collison made two free throws late in the third to make it 94-67. It was Indiana's second straight blowout win -- both coming against the two Los Angeles franchises. The Pacers beat the Lakers 136-94 on Tuesday while handing LeBron James the worst loss of his pro career. The last time Indiana had such lopsided wins over the two teams in the same season was 2005-06, when the Pacers beat the Lakers 105-79 and the Clippers 97-75. CLIPPERS' ROSTER MOVES The Clippers officially announced after the game trade deadline moves that include acquiring center Ivica Zubac and forward Michael Beasley from the Los Angeles Lakers for center Mike Muscala. The Clippers also got forward JaMychal Green and guard Garrett Temple from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for guard Avery Bradley.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The trade deadline came and went and Terrence Ross remained in Orlando, comfortable in his routine. Ross, whose expiring contract and big scoring production had set him up as a potential trade asset, scored 32 points and came up with a big defensive play to help the Magic to a 122-112 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday night. ""Right now is not the time to change anything you're doing,"" said Ross, who was relieved when the deadline passed. ""You've got to stay in your routine as much as possible."" Ross, who is averaging 19.7 points off the bench over his last 15 games, made six 3-pointers and shot 13 of 23 overall. ""There are nights in this league when you're driving home and say to yourself, `I'm blessed to be doing this,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Terrence is an exceptional shot-maker and he's a lot better off the dribble than I realized. He's playing at a really high level."" Nikola Vucevic added 21 points, Aaron Gordon 19 and Evan Fournier 18 for Orlando, which shot 54 percent and scored a season-high 71 points in the first half. Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points and 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who lost for the fifth time in six games. Andrew Wiggins added 23 points. Isaiah Canaan's jump shot gave Minnesota its last lead at 39-38 early in the second quarter, but things quickly unraveled for the Timberwolves, especially on defense. Ross had 20 points in the first half, leading the Magic to a 71-58 halftime lead. Orlando shot 65 percent in the half. ""They came out hot. We've got to do a better job contesting,"" said Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders. ""Terrence Ross got hot in the second quarter. We were aware of how hot he's been shooting the ball lately. You let him see one or two or even three go through early, it's going to be a long night."" Wiggins scored 10 points in the third quarter, but the Timberwolves could get no closer than 11 until Towns converted a three-point play with 2:39 left in the fourth. Wiggins followed with a mid-court steal and lined up a dunk that could have cut the lead to seven, but Ross chased him down and prevented a score that could cut the gap to seven. ""I didn't know if I was going to block it but it was worth the effort,"" said Ross, who was not officially credited with a block. ""You don't know.

Asked when the team expected Fultz to play, president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman said: ""We're going to do it right, we're not going to do it fast."" The Magic gave up F Jonathon Simmons, a protected 2020 first-round pick and a 2019 second-round pick for Fultz, who is out with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, a nerve problem in his shoulder.

"ATLANTA --  The Toronto Raptors have a new big man coming to help their push for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. In the meantime, the Raptors won by playing small. Pascal Siakam scored a career-high 33 points, Fred VanVleet added a career-best 30 and the Raptors rallied after trailing by 17 points in the first half to beat the Atlanta Hawks 119-101 on Thursday night. Toronto, which pulled within 1  1/2 games of Eastern Conference leader Milwaukee, acquired center Marc Gasol from Memphis before Thursday's trade deadline for Jonas Valanciunas, C.J. Miles and Delon Wright, and a 2024 second-round draft pick. The team should learn Friday when to expect Gasol's arrival. ""There are a lot of positives that come with a guy like Gasol and I think most of them come with being battle-tested,"" said Raptors coach Nick Nurse. ""He's got a hell of a career under his belt."" The Raptors were short-handed after trading four players in two deals. Toronto also traded center Greg Monroe to the Nets for cash considerations. Toronto used only nine players and relied heavily on Siakam, who also had 13 rebounds, and VanVleet with All-Star Kawhi Leonard resting. Rookie Trae Young and Taurean Price each had 19 points for Atlanta. Atlanta led 66-49 in the second quarter. ""I give them credit, man, they came out guns a blazing,"" Nurse said of the Hawks. After their big deficit, the Raptors used an 11-0 run to launch their comeback. Danny Green, who had 12 points, sank three free throws to cap the run. Toronto kept the momentum in the third quarter and led 88-85 entering the final period. The Raptors opened the fourth quarter with a 13-3 run to extend the lead in their third straight win. The Hawks scored 68 points in the first half and only 33 after halftime.

HAWKS DEALS The Hawks plan to release two players acquired in separate deals, Shelvin Mack and Jabari Bird.

"BOSTON --  LeBron James won't be playing alongside Anthony Davis this season. But he does have a team he's hoping can build on a big win over its longtime rival. Rajon Rondo hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired to lift the Los Angeles Lakers over the Boston Celtics, 129-128 on Thursday night. ""I practice those shots all the time,"" said Rondo, who hit his first career go-ahead field goal in the final 10 seconds of fourth quarter or overtime. ""Couldn't imagine it being in the Garden though. ... This is one I'll be playing for the rest of my life."" James had 28 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists. Kyle Kuzma added 25 points and Rondo had 17 points and 10 assists to help Los Angeles bounce back after a 42-point loss at Indiana on Tuesday. James is the third Lakers player with a triple-double in Boston, joining Magic Johnson and Elgin Baylor. ""I'm starting to get more and more back to myself,"" James said. ""Every possession, every quarter, every time I take a hit, I'm able to nudge it off and keep going. I'm working my way back and I'm getting better and better every single minute."" Rondo was in the right place at the right time for his final shot against the team he won an NBA title with in 2008. Brandon Ingram had his layup attempt blocked by Al Horford, but Horford whiffed on the rebound and the ball bounced into Rondo's hands. ""I thought the basketball gods rewarded the right team,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Kyrie Irving led Boston with 24 points and eight assists. Jayson Tatum added 22 points and 10 rebounds. Daniel Theis has 20 points off the bench but the Celtics had a five-game win streak snapped. It ended a wild, speculation-filled day in which the NBA's trade deadline expired with one of the players potentially on the wish list of both the Lakers and Celtics staying with his current team. ""I'm happy to still be on the team,"" said Tatum, whose name has been the subject of recent trade speculation. ""I'm glad that it's over with for now."" Los Angeles attempted to put together a deal for Davis, but New Orleans held onto the All-Star despite him saying recently that he would not sign an extension and wanted to be traded. It means any potential suitor will have to wait until the summer to make a run at him. The Lakers weren't completely quiet Thursday, trading Michael Beasley and Ivica Zubac to the Clippers for Mike Muscala. But for now, James will have to go forward with most of a roster that improved to 2-2 since his return from a groin injury that kept him out of action a month. TIP-INS Lakers: Shot 22 of 41 from the 3-point line. Celtics: Were outscored 50-42 in the paint. . Shot 16 of 38 from the 3-point line. WILD FINISH Boston led by as many as 18 in the first half. The Lakers erased it in third quarter, connecting on nine of their 13 attempts from beyond the arc and outscoring the Celtics 42-27 in the period to retake the lead entering the fourth. But the Celtics responded with a 15-4 run to start the final period to get it back. James and Irving traded shots down the stretch. In one exchange James' 3-pointer cut Boston's lead to 114-113. Irving then calmly responded with his own step-back 27-footer. Later, it was Irving assisting on a big basket. With Boston leading 121-118, Irving drove into the middle of the Los Angeles defense and kicked it out to a wide-open Marcus Morris for a 3 with just 1:24 left. But following an Irving turnover, James tied it with his own corner 3-pointer. TOUGHER EAST The Celtics stood mostly pat at the trade deadline, except for trading Jabari Bird to the Atlanta Hawks. The move opens a roster spot for the Celtics and allowed them part ways with a player who hasn't played this season after charged with beating up his girlfriend last September. But two of the teams currently in front of them in the East did make some changes. The Bucks, who had the best record in the NBA entering the day, picked up Nikola Mirotic in a deal with the Pelicans. The Raptors added former All-Star center Marc Gasol from Memphis in exchange for center Jonas Valanciunias. ""Those teams were already really good. And the assumption would only be that they'd only benefit from those moves,"" Stevens said.","401071487"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder got a familiar performance from Russell Westbrook while the Memphis Grizzlies struggled to get used to playing without Marc Gasol. Westbrook had his eighth straight triple-double, and Oklahoma City rolled past the trade-depleted Grizzlies 117-95 on Thursday night. Westbrook finished with 15 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds. He now has the longest triple-double streak of his career and is one short of Wilt Chamberlain's NBA record of nine straight set in 1968. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies were reeling from the news that Gasol was traded to the Toronto Raptors for three players. The Grizzlies also announced Thursday that they sent JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple to the Los Angeles Clippers for Avery Bradley, and Shelvin Mack to Atlanta for Tyler Dorsey. The loss of Gasol hit the hardest. He had played his entire 11-year career with the Grizzlies. ""You kind of try to prepare yourself as best you can, knowing that there's a possibility that Marc might not be with us come the trade deadline,"" Memphis point guard Mike Conley said. ""You think you've kind of figured it out and you're ready for it, but when it happens, it's a completely different locker room. It's a completely different feel.

Even with that, Memphis led 53-51 at halftime before the Thunder found their groove. Oklahoma City center Steven Adams stole the ball and drove nearly the length of the floor for a layup to put the Thunder ahead 57-55. Adams was scoreless in the first half, but he had nine points in the third quarter to help Oklahoma City take an 83-72 lead.

HE SAID IT Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson on continuing to shoot 3-pointers after a rough first half: ""Russ (Westbrook) told me he was going to beat me up if I stopped shooting, so I had to keep shooting.""","401071488"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Trail Blazers expected that a team like San Antonio would mount a rally. The key was withstanding it. CJ McCollum had 30 points, including seven 3-pointers, and Portland handed the Spurs their third straight loss with a 127-118 victory on Thursday night. The Blazers led by as many as 21 points early in the third quarter but the Spurs rallied to tie it at 88 before the end of the period. ""We never panicked. We know they're a good team, they're well coached, they're going to execute and play hard. We just wanted to get some stops and kind of stop the bleeding,"" McCollum said. It was the second straight game that McCollum has had seven 3s, which match his career high. With his second 3-pointer, McCollum passed Terry Porter for third on Portland's all-time list. Damian Lillard added 24 points and nine assists for the Blazers, who were coming off a loss at home to Miami but have won seven of their last nine games overall. DeMar DeRozan had 35 points for the Spurs, who were playing the third game of an extended road trip because of the rodeo visiting AT&amp;T Center. The Blazers led 96-90 going into the final period and extended it to 108-97 when Lillard found McCollum in the corner for a 3-pointer with 7:39 to play. Rodney Hood's 3 gave the Blazers a 125-110 lead with just over two minutes left. Hood, acquired by the Blazers in a Sunday trade with Cleveland, made his debut in Portland with 4:09 to go in the first quarter. He finished with 14 points. ""We just couldn't sustain it,"" DeRozan said. ""We didn't put the defensive energy we needed going into the fourth and they got it going again and got up 10. It's tough on the road against a team like the Trail Blazers with their great shooters. If you don't slow them down it's going to be tough to win."" In addition to Hood, the Blazers acquired forward Skal Labissiere from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for forward Caleb Swanigan just before the trade deadline on Thursday. Labissiere, taken 28th overall in the 2016 draft by the Kings, was averaging 2.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in 13 games this season. He was not available to play Thursday night. The Spurs did not make any moves prior to the deadline. Hood's running jumper gave the Blazers a 49-48 lead midway through the second quarter. Portland extended the lead to 67-54 after Al-Farouq Aminu's layup and led 70-57 at the break. Jusuf Nurkic led all players at the half with 14 points for the Blazers. The Blazers extended the lead by as many as 21 points in the third quarter, going up 84-63 on Lillard's step back jumper. But Rudy Gay made three straight 3-pointers to get the Spurs back within 86-74. The Spurs went on a 25-4 run, capped by DeRozan's jumper that tied the game at 88. ""They had a really good stretch. That happens. It's a game of runs,"" Lillard said. ""They had their run, but I was proud of who we handled that. We pulled out a good win."" Gay had 16 points in the third quarter, including four 4-pointers. He finished with 25 points. LaMarcus Aldridge had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs against his former team. ""We got down by 18 or 20 and they showed a lot of grit getting back into the game but after that McCollum was just too tough. He and Damian were great,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. Hood admitted after the game that he was a bit nervous in his first game with a new team. ""I know a few plays, there were couple of them they threw out there I didn't know,"" Hood said. ""They helped me through it, guys were talking to me."" TURNING 50 The Portland Trail Blazers have announced some of the plans for next season's 50th anniversary, including a special logo and a preseason game at the team's old arena, Memorial Coliseum. There will even be a commemorative Trail Blazers Pinot Noir in partnership with Oregon winemaker Adelsheim Vineyard. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the Blazers represent the ""ethos of what we have to offer: our pioneering spirit, our perseverance, and our trail-blazing mentality."" TIP INS Spurs: San Antonio remained without Derrick White because of a sore right heel for the third straight game, although coach Popovich said before the game that he expected White to be back ""pretty soon"" after the All-Star break. Trail Blazers: The Blazers sent Nik Stauskas, Wade Baldwin and two future second-round picks to the Cavaliers in exchange for Hood. Stauskas and Baldwin were traded three times in five days before they were waived Thursday by the Indiana Pacers. ... Portland outscored the Spurs 39-23 in the second quarter. ... Portland improves to 2-1 against the Spurs this season.","401071489"
"DETROIT --  It was another relaxing fourth quarter for Blake Griffin. Andre Drummond had 29 points and 20 rebounds, and the Detroit Pistons handed New York its 15th straight loss, beating the Knicks 120-103 on Friday night. The Knicks rallied from a 21-point second-quarter deficit, tying the game in the third. But Detroit avoided a repeat of its collapse last weekend against the Los Angeles Clippers, when the Pistons lost after leading by 25. Since that game, Detroit has won three in a row, and in two of those victories -- including Friday's -- the game was so lopsided down the stretch that Griffin didn't play at all in the final period. ""Beyond the wins, we're playing with the right spirit and playing basketball the right way,"" Griffin said. ""The basketball gods reward you when you play the right way, and being able to take a fourth quarter off has been really nice -- especially at this time of the season."" Griffin scored 26 points for the Pistons, who traded Reggie Bullock and Stanley Johnson in deadline deals but kept enough of their top players to make a postseason berth still plausible. Detroit began the day 1  1/2 games out of a playoff spot. The Knicks have lost 28 of their last 30, and they looked overmatched at the start against Detroit, falling behind 21-5. It was 41-22 after one quarter, and the Pistons led 63-54 at halftime. Drummond had 20 points at the break. New York kept chipping away in the third, but Detroit eventually recovered, leading 89-84 after three and pushing the lead back to double digits relatively quickly in the fourth. Dennis Smith Jr. scored 31 points for the Knicks. ""We've just got to bring that intensity every night and if we do that, I think the wins will start to pile up,"" Smith said. ""Tonight, I thought we brought it, but it was on me. I've got to make free throws."" AT THE LINE The Knicks finished 26 of 41 on free throws, and Smith was 11 of 19. He went 1 of 6 in the fourth. ""It just ends up breaking you when you don't hit those shots, especially after you gain so much momentum fighting back,"" New York coach David Fizdale said. ""But, I was pretty proud of the way the kids battled back and got themselves into that game."" NEW ARRIVALS The Pistons acquired Thon Maker and Svi Mykhailiuk in their trades. Both played sparingly Friday. Maker was scoreless and Mykhailiuk made a 3-pointer . LOOKING BETTER Point guard Reggie Jackson's struggles have exemplified Detroit's disappointing season so far, but he seems to be playing better of late. He scored 20 points with six assists Friday. ""Since the last month, or last three weeks at least, he's got a bounce to him and he is making good decisions,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""Defensively he is chesting up people, making sure he gets in the pick-and-rolls, but most of all he is making good decisions with the basketball."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York has been without Emmanuel Mudiay (strained left shoulder) and Frank Ntilikina (sore groin). Pistons: It was a league-high ninth 20-20 game for Drummond this season and his 29th overall. Since the 1988-89 season, only Dwight Howard (51) and Shaquille O'Neal (34) have more.","401071490"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The new-look Philadelphia 76ers made a strong first impression with little time practicing together. JJ Redick scored a season-high 34 points, Jimmy Butler had 22 and the Sixers beat the Denver Nuggets 117-110 on Friday night with four players making their debut. Tobias Harris had 14 points and eight rebounds in his first game for Philadelphia and Joel Embiid scored 15 and grabbed 12 boards despite playing with a stomach flu. The Sixers made a flurry of moves before Thursday's trade deadline, acquiring Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott from the Clippers, James Ennis from Houston and Jonathon Simmons from Orlando. ""You couldn't ask for any better,"" Harris said. ""To play like that, get that reaction from fans, it meant a lot to me. It was awesome. Feels good to be appreciated."" Nikola Jokic led Denver with 27 points and Jamal Murray had 23. The Nuggets, who have the second-best record (37-18) in the Western Conference behind Golden State, were missing two of their top five scorers: Gary Harris and Paul Millsap. ""You look at that starting lineup, aside from Redick, they have size, length and athleticism,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""They're tough to handle."" Harris hit a jumper to give the Sixers a 105-103 lead with under four minutes left and then grabbed a rebound to set up Embiid's layup. Butler stole the ball, got fouled and hit a pair of three throws to extend the lead to 109-103. Ben Simmons' driving, left-handed dunk over Mason Plumlee thrilled the crowd and deflated the Nuggets. Sixers legend Allen Iverson jumped from his courtside seat and smacked hands with fans after Simmons' thunderous slam. ""It's going to take time,"" Simmons said. ""Chemistry is going to start flowing. Right now, I'm happy with what I'm seeing."" Philadelphia (35-20) is ted with Boston for the fourth spot in the East. Sixers coach Brett Brown said his play sheet was ""frugal"" because he couldn't prepare much in the short time since the trades. ""I thought they were unselfish,"" Brown said. ""They shared the ball. We moved when we didn't have the ball. We have more to give."" The Sixers took a 50-34 lead when Simmons lobbed an alley-oop pass to Butler for a one-handed jam and Ennis hit a 3 off a cross-court pass from Harris. But Denver answered with a 22-6 run to tie it at 56 at halftime. Philly led 83-82 after three quarters. Harris helped ignite an early 10-0 run. He hit a 3-pointer, 8-footer and dished to Redick for an open 3 to cap the burst. Marjanovic got a loud ovation when he entered the game midway through the first and another one after he scored on a driving layup. KEEP THE CORE Sixers GM Elton Brand said the team plans to retain Butler and Harris, who are both playing the final years of their contracts. ""I've gotten all assurances from the managing partners that we can bring them back and sign them for whatever it takes to sign them. We want to keep this core long term,"" Brand said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Harris missed his fifth consecutive game with a strained right groin. Millsap missed his third straight with right ankle soreness. ...

Malone helped lead Philadelphia to its last championship 36 years ago. ... Members of the 1983 NBA championship team, including ""Dr. J"" Julius Erving, rang the team's ceremonial bell at midcourt before the game. ... Ennis had six points and Marjanovic had four.

"WASHINGTON --  When the Washington Wizards found out that All-Star point guard John Wall was going to need surgery for a ruptured left Achilles tendon, just a month after surgery to repair bone spurs in his left heel, they decided to regroup. Wall's surgery will cost him at least the majority of the 2019-20 season. After learning the news just ahead of the NBA's trading deadline, the Wizards quickly traded Otto Porter Jr. and Markieff Morris in separate deals. One of the players Washington acquired from the Chicago Bulls for Porter, Bobby Portis, had a spectacular debut, scoring 30 points to lead the Wizards over the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-106 on Friday night. Portis had 16 in the first quarter, hitting all six of his field-goal attempts in the period. ""When I first got here yesterday, I felt the love right off,"" Portis said. ""Everybody welcomed me in. All my teammates and my coaches wanted me to be myself."" Portis said the advice he received was succinct. ""`Don't try and fine tune. Come in and be who you are.' That's who I am,"" he said. The Wizards led 77-57 early in the third quarter, but the Cavaliers got to within 89-86 late in the period. Thanks in part to 10 more points from Portis in the fourth, Washington pulled away. ""Great pickup,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""That's an understatement."" Bradley Beal added 25 points and 12 assists. Jabari Parker, who came along with Portis from Chicago, had seven points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. ""I was actually surprised with how well (Portis) was able to mesh quickly on the fly, him and Jabari,"" Beal said. ""It was almost like free-flowing. That's how we play anyway."" Cleveland, which has lost 21 of 24, was led by Collin Sexton with 27 points. Jordan Clarkson scored 24, and Larry Nance Jr. had 10 points and a career-high 19 rebounds. ""We turned the basketball over five times in that first quarter, which you just cannot do on the road,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""They built the lead, a lead just too big for us to overcome."" In his first game back after left foot surgery forced him to miss 50 games, Kevin Love started and played the first six minutes, scoring four points. He did not return to the game. Drew said Love would not play when Cleveland plays at Indiana on Saturday night. NEW ACQUISTIONS Besides Parker, Wesley Johnson, who came from New Orleans for Morris, had two points in 15 minutes. Brooks was impressed with Parker, but said he could have done more. ""I'm probably the one that kept him from a triple-double,"" Brooks said. Marquese Chriss, who was picked up by the Cavaliers in a three-team trade, had 13 points in 23 minutes. ""I thought he did a good job for the first time, not really knowing what we're doing as far as our plays and defensive schemes,"" Drew said. ""We threw him into the fire and I thought he responded well."" WALL SPEAKS Wall, who will undergo surgery on Tuesday, said he was in ""great"" spirits and plans to spend time with his newborn son and his mother, who has cancer, during his rehabilitation. ""I guess God is telling me something,"" Wall said about the Achilles injury. ""To sit down and get yourself fully healthy. I've played through injuries my whole career. I know a lot of people who played through injuries and don't sit down. That's one thing I don't like to do. If something that's nagging or not broken, I want to play. I guess it kind of caught up to me."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: F/C Tristan Thompson, who is out with left foot soreness, missed his 10th straight game. ... F Cedi Osman, who has a sprained right ankle, missed his second straight game. ... G Brandon Knight, acquired in a trade Thursday, did not play. Wizards: Have just one home game between Friday and March 3. ... F Troy Brown missed his third game with a sprained left ankle. Brooks said Brown was ""probably another week or so"" from returning.","401071492"
"NEW YORK --  Otto Porter Jr. had a strong debut for the Chicago Bulls -- even without a practice or walkthrough with his new teammates. Two days after being acquired from Washington, Porter scored 18 points to help lift the Bulls to a 125-106 rout of the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night. ""He played great,"" Lauri Markkanen said. ""I'm glad we have him."" Markkanen wasn't bad, either. He led all players with 31 points and 18 rebounds, and has at least 30 points in three straight games for Chicago. He knocked down 11 of 18 shots from the field, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. And in the final minutes, the second-year pro finished the game at center after starting at power forward. ""He's smart,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. ""He knows if he rebounds, it gets him into the game. So he's trying to get every rebound he can and then he's suddenly driving the ball more."" Porter Jr. and Markkanen were hardly a two-man operation for Chicago, which has scored more than 100 points in 17 consecutive games. Zach LaVine added 23 points, Robin Lopez and Kris Dunn each had 12, and Wayne Selden Jr. finished with 11. The win snapped a two-game skid for the Bulls. Chicago has still lost three of five, seven of nine, and 16 of 19 dating to Dec. 30. ""We got a lot from a lot of guys,"" Boylen said. ""I felt like we looked like a team out there and played like a team. I'm happy for them. I'm happy for our guys. I'm proud of our guys."" While the Bulls were reveling in a job well done, the Nets left feeling as if they gifted a win to one of the worst teams in the league. D'Angelo Russell, named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team earlier in the week, led the Nets with 23 points but Brooklyn dropped to 29-28 with its third loss in five games. Allen Crabbe and Joe Harris each finished with 19 points. ""We just weren't really locked in defensively,"" Crabbe said. ""They got basically whatever they wanted, did whatever they wanted to do. I don't think we gave them any resistance on the defensive side. Guys were comfortable out there."" At first glance, the game seemed liked a mismatch. The Nets have been one of the NBA's surprise stories as they find themselves in the Eastern Conference playoff picture, while the Bulls are in a heated race with Atlanta, Cleveland, Phoenix and the New York Knicks to be in the best position to win the NBA draft lottery and potentially select Duke power forward Zion Williamson. But, the Bulls led 55-48 at halftime. Chicago's biggest lead in the first half was 10 at 40-30, but the Nets used 17-6 run spanning 6:28 to go up by 1 at 47-46, before the Bulls ended the first half by outscoring Brooklyn 9-1. Chicago made 21 of 44 shots from the field in the first half, including 6 of 11 from 3-point range, while the Nets struggled at 16 for 43 overall, and 5 of 17 from beyond the arc. For the game, the Bulls made 54.1 percent (46 for 85) of its shots from the field, and knocked down exactly 50 percent (14 for 28) of its 3s. By comparison, the Nets made 39 of 94 (41.5 percent) shots from the field, and misfired on 28 of 41 3-point attempts (31.7 percent). ""They outplayed us 1 through 12,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Chicago extended its lead to as many as 14 in the third quarter, and had a 93-80 advantage going into the fourth. The advantage grew to 19 in the fourth after LaVine's layup with 2:44 left. ""Our defense was just non-existent,"" Atkinson said. TIP-INS: BULLS: The win snapped Chicago's six-game losing streak to Brooklyn, and its four-game losing streak at Barclays Center. The Bulls had lost the three previous meetings this season. NETS: About 45 minutes before the opening tip-off, Brooklyn general manager Sean Marks spoke to reporters about the state of the team. While he spoke cautiously, Marks was unquestionably proud of how his team has played through the first 56 games. ""I give our players a heck of a lot of credit for how they've handled this first, you know, over half of the season,"" he said. ""It's really been led by them. They took the reins of this thing and they've been pushing and believing."" COMEBACK CARIS Nets third-year guard Caris LeVert played for the first time since suffering a subtalar dislocation of the right foot in a 120-113 loss to the Timberwolves in Minnesota on Nov. 12. He had missed 42 games. ""It felt good to get back out there with the team,"" said LeVert, who finished with 11 points in nearly 15 minutes. ""Obviously we didn't get the win out there, but it felt good to be back.""","401071493"
"DALLAS --  Giannis Antetokounmpo got the best of fellow Euro star Luka Doncic again, and Milwaukee's All-Star captain has help on the way. Doncic, the 19-year-old Dallas rookie sensation, is all that's left from the starting lineup the Mavericks put together in the offseason. Antetokounmpo had 29 points and 17 rebounds and the Bucks rolled to their sixth straight victory, beating the retooling Mavericks 122-107 on Friday night. The Bucks outscored the Mavericks 80-26 in the paint, led by Antetokounmpo going 13 of 19 from the field while repeatedly powering his way to dunks and layups. Brook Lopez scored 20 points for the Bucks, who have surged to the best record in the NBA (41-13) with a pair of six-win runs on either side of a loss. One of those victories was over the Mavericks at home, when Antetokounmpo scored 31 points to Doncic's 18 in a 10-point win. ""Antetokounmpo is a great player, but 80 points in the paint is just ridiculous,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""In this league, you have to be able to guard penetration ... with a level of force and will. We did not do that."" Doncic scored 20 points but had just three rebounds and two assists in his first game since the NBA's only teenager with multiple triple-doubles got his third. Dallas was without Harrison Barnes, traded to Sacramento two nights earlier while playing in a win over Charlotte. The Mavericks had already shipped starters Dennis Smith Jr., Wesley Matthews and DeAndre Jordan to the New York Knicks. Both deals were more about the future than the present, signified mostly by the plan to sit the biggest prize. Kristaps Porzingis won't play the rest of the season while recovering from a knee injury the 2018 All-Star sustained last February while with the Knicks. ""It's hard,"" Doncic said. ""They were four people that always played with me, a lot of time together. I just have to adjust to it."" Milwaukee didn't have Nikola Mirotic a day after acquiring him from New Orleans before the trading deadline. It didn't matter as the Bucks shot 54 percent despite going 10 of 36 (28 percent) from 3-point range. Antetokounmpo attacked from the beginning, getting a layup and dunk for the first two baskets of the game. Lopez had little trouble around the rim as well, making six of eight from inside the arc while going 2 of 6 from long range. Even guard Malcolm Brogdon backed down the Mavericks for easy buckets, finishing with 18 points along with backcourt mate Eric Bledsoe. ""We are scoring at a really high rate in the paint,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We sprinkled in a few 3s here and there."" TIP-INS Bucks: F Khris Middleton was given a night of rest on the front end of a back-to-back. ... Budenholzer said it wasn't clear whether Mirotic would be available for his Milwaukee debut on the second night of a back-to-back at home against Orlando. The fifth-year forward has been listed with a right calf strain and missed his last seven games with the Pelicans. Mavericks: Antetokounmpo's brother, F Kostas Antetokounmpo, was expected to be active before he was a late scratch because of an illness. The younger Antetokounmpo is a rookie who hasn't played for the Mavericks and has spent most of the season with their G-League team. He was active but didn't play when the teams met in Milwaukee last month. ... Trey Burke, one of four players to join Dallas in the seven-player blockbuster with New York, scored 18 points. Tim Hardaway Jr., another guard from that trade, had 12. TRY AGAIN Antetokounmpo shot an air ball on a 3-pointer in the first quarter but came back and swished one less than a minute later. He was 1 of 3 from long range. ""I love he missed one and ... two possessions later, shoots another and makes it,"" Budenholzer said. ""We've been saying for the whole year, when he's open we want him shooting with confidence."" BIG SWING IN THIRD The Mavericks had a season-high 22 3-pointers, going 9 of 16 in the third quarter. Milwaukee pushed a 13-point halftime lead to 23 before the Mavericks got back within eight going into the fourth quarter. NO RANDOLPH FOR MAVS Dallas waived Zach Randolph two days after acquiring the forward from Sacramento in the Barnes deal, a trade designed for salary-cap relief. The 37-year-old Randolph never played for the Kings in his second season with them. Justin Jackson, the other player in the deal, made his Dallas debut late in the fourth quarter and hit a 3-pointer.","401071494"
"PHOENIX --  Make it 18 wins in a row for the Golden State Warriors over the Phoenix Suns. The latest, though, was no cakewalk for the reigning NBA champions. Stephen Curry shook off a poor shooting performance by scoring 10 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and the Warriors finally broke open a tight game to beat the Suns 117-107 on Friday night. Klay Thompson scored 25 points for the Warriors. Kevin Durant added 21 points and DeMarcus Cousins 18. ""They totally outplayed us all night,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""The only reason we won is because we have a lot more talent, obviously."" Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 25 points and Deandre Ayton 23 for Phoenix, which was without scoring leader Devin Booker due to a tight right hamstring. Mikal Bridges and Josh Jackson added 19 apiece for the Suns, who led 85-82 entering the final quarter. Golden State's Draymond Green was ejected after drawing his second technical between the third and fourth quarters. The matchup of the teams at the top and bottom of the Western Conference standings was a lot closer than anticipated -- and in large part because it took Curry a while to find his stroke. Through three quarters, Curry was 2-of-12 shooting, including 1 of 8 on 3-pointers. But in the fourth quarter, he was 4 of 5, including 2 of 3 from beyond the arc. ""We can compete,"" said Ayton, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft. ""We're maturing even though we're young. We can challenge any team. Don't mind our record, there's a lot of guys with a lot of great potential and we could actually make a dynasty team."" Down 94-88, Golden State took control with a 13-0 run -- capped by Curry's 3-pointer that put the Warriors up 101-94 with 5:46 remaining. Richaun Holmes' tip-in cut the lead to 101-98 with 4:58 left. But Curry responded with another 3 and Golden State pulled away from there. ""I think we just started making shots,"" Durant said. ""They played extremely hard. "" Phoenix shot out to a 26-9 lead but the Warriors cut it to 31-26 after one quarter. Green's driving layup capped a 13-3 Golden State run that put the Warriors up 60-51 before Oubre's tip-in sliced the Warriors' lead to 60-53 at the break. Phoenix opened the second half with an 11-4 spurt to tie it at 64, and it stayed tight the rest of the third quarter. Oubre made one free throw with 4.9 seconds left, missed the second and grabbed the rebound for a dunk that put the Suns up 85-82 entering the final quarter. ""Sometimes in this league, it can be ugly for 44 minutes and the last four you kind of revitalize your team,"" Thompson said, ""and that's what Steph and DeMarcus did, K.D., and any win you get in this league you have to be grateful for."" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov liked his team's effort, but said the Warriors' ability and experience came through in the end. ""They were so precise in late switch, miscommunication, late shifts from the weak side, they made us pay,"" he said. ""It's just a learning experience for young guys. And it's a poised veteran team, a team with a high IQ. They knew how to close a game."" TIP-INS Warriors: Their 18-game win streak against Phoenix is the second-longest active streak against a single opponent behind only Oklahoma City's 21-game run against Philadelphia. ... Warriors have won 11 consecutive road wins. ... Golden State drew three first-half technical: on Green, Cousins and Shaun Livingston. Suns: Booker missed his 15th game of the season. ... Phoenix also was without T.J. Warren (right ankle soreness) and De'Anthony Melton (right ankle sprain). ...

"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis didn't need long to win back the crowd after being booed during his pregame introduction and the first few chances he had to handle the ball. But the Pelicans sought to close out a tight game without Davis on the court anyway -- and narrowly pulled it off. Playing for first time since asking to be traded, Davis had 32 points, nine rebounds and three blocks in 25 minutes, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 122-117 on Friday night. Davis said hearing boos surprised him a bit and was ""definitely awkward,"" but added, ""That's life, man. Some people aren't going to like it. I worry about playing basketball."" ""I just love the game, love playing,"" Davis continued. And as he glanced around the locker room, he added, ""Me and all these guys in here have a special relationship. And so obviously I want to be on the floor with them. They wanted me on the floor. And it was as simple as that. ""The other stuff, the outside noise, Twitter rants, it's all good,"" Davis said. ""It doesn't bother me. I want to play and being able to go out there and to be able to play the game I love for 25 minutes, it was fun."" Jrue Holiday had 27 points and nine assists and Kenrich Williams had 19 points -- and they led the Pelicans' offense in the fourth quarter, when Davis was kept on the bench despite the teams being separated by as little as one basket several times in the waning minutes. Gentry said he limited Davis' minutes because Davis had not played since spraining his left index finger on Jan. 18. ""I was not going to have him -- first game back -- play 38, 40 minutes,"" Gentry said. ""We had talked about playing between 22 and 25 minutes. That's why he didn't go back in the game. I thought he played well the minutes that he was in there and did a great job. He was typical Anthony."" Instead of playing Davis, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry sent in Julius Randle, who came through with a pair of inside baskets and clutch free throws in the final minutes. ""I guess he's giving a lot of people a chance to finish out games and be in important positions,"" Holiday said. ""Overall, it was a good win."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 32 points for Minnesota, which dropped its fourth straight. Towns shot 12 of 20, made four of five 3-point attempts, and his driving dunk pulled the Timberwolves as close as 114-112 in the final minute. But Randle responded with one of his late baskets inside and then rebounded Towns' missed jump hook with 16 seconds left. Andrew Wiggins had 23 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for Minnesota, which shot and rebounded marginally better than New Orleans, but was outscored 27-16 at the free throw line. The Pelicans also had a 28-7 advantage in fast-break points, helped by Minnesota's 16 turnovers, which led to 24 Pelicans points. The Timberwolves were playing their third straight road game and were coming off a loss Thursday night in Orlando. ""It has been a long road trip. Guys are fatigued and banged up, trying to figure out a way to win,"" forward Taj Gibson said. ""We came real close; we just didn't have enough to pull it off."" Randle and Time Frazier each scored 12 points for New Orleans, which has won two straight. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jerryd Bayless sat out with soreness in the big toe on his right foot. ... Jeff Teague was available coming off the bench after missing eight games with a left foot injury. He had 12 points, five assists and four rebounds in 17 minutes. Isaiah Canaan also scored 12. Pelicans: Randle finished with 12 points. Center Jahlil Okafor sat out with a left ankle sprain that occurred late in New Orleans' victory at Chicago on Wednesday night. ... Guard E'Twaun Moore also was ruled out shortly before tipoff with a left thigh bruise that also had sidelined him the previous five games. DETERMINED DAVIS Davis looked determined from the outset to justify his continued presence on the court, however awkward it may be for a franchise that had seemed inclined to move on without him. Pressured by the NBA not to sit a healthy star they had refused to unload by Thursday's trading deadline for this season, the Pelicans announced that Davis would return to the starting lineup. He scored 10 points in the first seven minutes. In the opening minutes, he went strong to the rim while being booed and dunked, at which point a segment of the crowd cheering largely drowned out the boo-birds. Later, as Davis stood on the foul line taking free throws, part of the crowd booed while others chanted, ""A-D, A-D!"" By halftime, Davis had 24 points and his highlights included a reverse alley-oop tip at the front of the rim while being foul and crashing to the floor on his back. Davis was fine, and reached the 30-point mark before the middle of the third quarter. ""The most important thing is just we got the win, guys played hard, guys played together,"" Davis said. ""I'm going to do everything I can. You know, I'm always going to remain professional at the end of the day. And any time I step on the floor, I want to be the best player I can be."" QUOTABLE ""It's kind of hard to boo somebody when he had like, 30 points in 20 minutes,"" Holiday said about the way Davis won over the crowd.","401071496"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Sacramento Kings have a legitimate chance to end their 13-year playoff drought and Dave Joerger is trying to impress upon his players the importance of doing the little things correctly. It took more than three quarters for them to get the message against Miami. Even then, it didn't pay off until a big run late in the final period. Buddy Hield scored 23 points and made a pair of free throws with 17 seconds left, and the Kings rallied from 11 down in the fourth quarter to beat the Heat 102-96 on Friday night. Sacramento pulled within one-half game of the Los Angeles Clippers for the final playoff spot in the West. ""I don't think maybe anybody thought we were going to be in this position at this point of the year,"" Joerger said. ""But things have happened in the Western Conference and we've got an opportunity, so now the little stuff matters. The silly quick shot, the silly turnover, not getting back on my guy fast enough. It really matters. Everything is amplified this time of year."" Bogdan Bogdanovic added 16 points and Harrison Barnes scored 12 in his Kings debut after being acquired from Dallas as part of a three-team trade earlier in the week. Josh Richardson scored 21 points and Dwyane Wade had 15 for Miami, all coming after the 12-time All-Star was involved in a scary fall with 15 seconds left in the first quarter. Wade landed awkwardly while going for a rebound and his head bounced against the floor. He immediately grabbed the back of his head, and then rolled onto his stomach, where he lay while being checked by a team trainer. Wade was eventually helped to his feet and walked off the court. He was examined by a team trainer and was checked for a possible concussion before returning with 4:35 remaining in the first half. ""I really don't know what happened,"" Wade said. ""I just know that I went up for the rebound and ended up on my (butt), and then my head hit the ground. But no concussion or anything. I did a lot of tests."" Hassan Whiteside added 17 points and 19 rebounds, while Dion Waiters scored 12 points for Miami. The Kings closed the game on a 9-0 run over the final 2 minutes to extend their winning streak to four over the Heat. Sacramento trailed 96-93 following Richardson's layup with 2:05 left. After Willie Cauley-Stein's dunk, Bogdanovic and Hield both made free throws. Hield then scored off an offensive rebound before he and Cauley-Stein combined for three free throws to end the run. The Kings rallied after Hield gave a pep talk in the huddle during a timeout. ""I was like, `We've been here before, we've done it before,"" Hield said. ""It comes down to confidence, wanting to be in that position and wanting to succeed and excel. As a young team, they don't expect us to excel but for us we have to put pressure on ourselves to do good in those situations so coach can trust us."" Before that, much of the attention was focused on Wade's final game in Sacramento that nearly ended early when Wade appeared to get hurt. After returning, Wade made a trio of 3-pointers then drove around Sacramento's 7-foot center Cauley-Stein for a layup that gave the Heat a 59-50 lead. Wade struggled down the stretch when Miami was trying to hold onto its lead. He committed a turnover while trying to lob a pass to Whiteside, then missed a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left. Richardson also missed a layup and had a pass go through his hands for a turnover in the final seconds. ""Defensively, they did a good job of pressuring up and making our shots tough,"" Wade said. ""They did a good job of making us get down late in the shot clock and having to force a few."" TIP-INS Heat: Whiteside's double-double was his fourth consecutive and 27th overall this season. ... Ryan Anderson, acquired in a trade from Phoenix at the deadline, did not play. Kings: Before the game, Corey Brewer signed a 10-day contract. The seventh overall pick in 2007, Brewer played in seven games with Philadelphia this season before being released by the 76ers earlier this week. QUIET DEBUTS Barnes played nearly 37 minutes, grabbed seven rebounds and shot 3 of 9 in his first game with Sacramento. Alec Burks, who was also part of the multi-team deal, had nine points and four rebounds.","401071497"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  When the Utah Jazz are executing their offense at home, it doesn't really matter what the defense throws at them. Playing against a triangle-and-two and zone at times, Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points, Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 13 rebounds and the Jazz beat the San Antonio Spurs 125-105 on Saturday. ""I haven't seen that kind of defense since maybe one time in college and a couple times in high school,"" Mitchell said. The Jazz shot 52.2 percent from the field and improved to 43-1 in their last 44 home games when making at least half their shots. ""We are moving the ball. We are putting a lot of pressure on the rim with our drives and the rolls, then we find the open guys, draw fouls or find the big man,"" said Gobert, who leads the league in field goal percentage at 65.3. Royce O'Neale, who spent his first extended time at power forward, tied his season high with 17 points and made all four of his 3-point attempts to help the Jazz win for the third time in their last four games. ""We got easy shots,"" O'Neale said. ""Once you see one go in, you get comfortable and you see another one go in, it feels good."" Ricky Rubio, who took to social media to celebrate surviving the trade deadline to stay with Utah, tallied 16 points, six rebounds, six assists and didn't turn the ball over. With the afternoon tip-off, his family in Spain watched the game at a more reasonable hour than the usual wee morning hours. ""I'm happy they could watch it and watch us win,"" Rubio said. ""It was a little weird in the beginning with that defense that we're not used to, but once we read the defense, we got what what we wanted and got the lead."" DeMar DeRozan scored 23 points and LaMarcus Aldridge had 15 for the Spurs, who have lost four in a row on their eight-game trip while their home arena hosts a 17-day stock show and rodeo. Their defense will need to improve if the Spurs want to end their skid on this road stretch. ""We got to stay in front of guys. It's our job as guards to stay in front of our man and not let that penetration get in and cause stress on our defense and let them get easy shots, easy layups, and put them on the free throw line. That's been a killer,"" DeRozan said. Tied at 32, the Jazz scored nine consecutive points, including two baskets at the rim by Gobert, to gain command. The Jazz got to the basket repeatedly and outscored the Spurs 22-2 in the paint during the second quarter and led 62-48 at the half. ""We turned the ball over. We had poor execution. That killed us right there, especially on the road where teams take advantage of it (by) getting out in transition with the crowd behind them,"" DeRozan said about the second-quarter collapse. This was the finale of the teams' three-game series. The Jazz own the tiebreaker and moved a full game ahead of the Spurs in the jumbled Western Conference standings. Aldridge, who was chosen for the All-Star Game while Gobert was snubbed -- prompting Jazz coach Quin Snyder to call for a different way of selecting participants -- went 5 of 16 from the field and had 10 rebounds. ""I liked the way we played today. We came locked in from the beginning and there was no slippage,"" said Gobert, who has 45 double-doubles and is tied for the league lead with Joel Embiid. This was Utah's third game making at least half their shots in the last four. The Jazz consistently found wide-open shooters against the Spurs' slow rotations and mismatched switches on pick-and-rolls. ""There's no time for sulking or anything like that. Utah played better than we did. They executed better. They made fewer mistakes over a 48-minute stretch and they won the game,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. GETTING DEFENSIVE ""That's our identity,"" said reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert. ""When we are all out there working and communicating with each other about the game plan, it's hard for us not to dominate defensively."" Though Gobert shrugged off his individual matchup against Aldridge and just complimented his opponent's skills, Mitchell said, ""The Big Fella took that one personally. ... I love seeing that. We all did a great job giving him help but he didn't really need that much of it."" That will be the key to extending Utah's run up the standings. ""We need to keep that same intensity on defense, like we had today. It starts with the Big Fella and leads to us, keeping the same poise and control."" TIP-INS Spurs: Rudy Gay missed the game with an ankle sprain. ... Jakob Poeltl started but fourth-quarter minutes went to Pau Gasol until the game was decided. ... The Spurs posted only four second-chance points as they were out-rebounded 52-36. Jazz: Gobert got a technical foul in the first quarter after a series of non-calls. ... O'Neale, who averages 4.9 points per game, hit three 3s in the second quarter. ... Favors had his eighth double-double of the season with 11 points and 10 rebounds. The Jazz are 7-1 in those games.","401071498"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers are sending a message to the rest of the NBA: Team basketball still wins games. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 23 points and the Pacers extended their winning streak to five with a 105-90 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night. Darren Collison added 18 points, Myles Turner had 14 points and eight rebounds and Domantas Sabonis came off the bench to score 13 points and grab 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who led by as many as 21 points. Indiana is third in the Eastern Conference standings. And, the Pacers have been doing this lately without Victor Oladipo, their lone All-Star who was lost for the season with a knee injury on Jan. 23. ""You can't just count on one player,"" Collison said. ""That's what's making us successful this year."" Collison pointed out the Pacers' reserves as having a big impact overall. ""You've got a guy like Cory Joseph, who you probably don't even notice, but he comes in the game and he has an impact,"" Collison said. ""Aaron (Holiday) has an impact. TJ (Leaf) who hasn't played, he has an impact. You've got a lot of guys that can have an impact on the game. Really underrated players."" Joseph had 10 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, falling one board short of a triple-double. Holiday had 4 points in 14 minutes, while Leaf added 8 points in just 8 minutes. Jordan Clarkson led the Cavaliers with 18 points, Larry Nance Jr. scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and Collin Sexton added 16 points for Cleveland. Bogdanovic and Turner shared the scoring load for Indiana to start the game, combining for 26 of the Pacers' 54 first-half points. Turner started off the game scoring eight of the Pacers' first 12 points, forcing Cleveland into an early timeout with back-to-back 3-pointers. The Pacers scored 30 points in the first quarter and led by 12 points at the half and never looked back. Earlier this week, Pacers coach Nate McMillan credited Indiana's ability to get back into a groove and play their style of basketball, which begins with good ball movement accompanying physical defense. ""We're moving the ball more, and I've always said when you have ball movement you're going to get good looks,"" McMillan said. ""We've been getting good ball movement. Guys have been kicking the ball out, they've been looking for each other, and that's how we want to play."" Indiana outscored Cleveland 54-32 in points in the paint. The Pacers used transition basketball to gain an advantage, outscoring the Cavs 16-9 in fastbreak points. ""(Indiana) makes it tough on you,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. ""They're a good team and they understand the magnitude of certain games and wanting to come out and play hard. They wanted to make a statement. I thought (Indiana) came out with a tremendous amount of energy and intensity in our last meeting (in Cleveland). I just kind of felt like they were (doing that) in tonight's game to try and set the tone."" DELAYED DEBUT Veteran swingman Wesley Matthews has cleared waivers, but as of Saturday, he had not yet officially signed with Indiana, his preferred destination, according to multiple reports. Matthews was waived by the Knicks following a deal that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas. SCARY MOMENT Just two weeks after Indiana lost Oladipo, Turner gave Pacers fans an all-too familiar fright. At the beginning of the third quarter, Turner appeared to injure his right leg, holding his knee when he landed. Turner gently limped off the floor under his own power and was taken to Indiana's locker room for several minutes before returning to the Pacers bench, eventually re-entering the game at the end of the third quarter. TIP-INS Cavs: Channing Frye is seven rebounds away from reaching 4,000 for his career. ... The Cavs are 3-12 since Jan. 2. ... Nance has recorded a double-double in five straight games. Pacers: For the third straight game, the Pacers scored at least 30 points in the first quarter. ... Indiana is two wins away from tying its largest winning streak of the season at seven games. ... Bogdanovic has scored in double figures in 32 straight games and scored 20 points or more in five of Indiana's last six games. ... Doug McDermott did not play due to bruised ribs.","401071499"
"ATLANTA --  Kemba Walker loved Charlotte's quick pace to begin the game. The Hornets were moving the ball briskly to hit open shots and put the Atlanta Hawks away early. ""I think it gave us great confidence, but for the most part I thought we did a great job of just moving the basketball,"" Walker said. ""Whenever guys had two defenders on them, they got rid of it and made the right plays and the right passes to each other. We just knocked the shots down."" Walker hit a season-high nine 3-pointers and scored 37 points, Marvin Williams added 27 points and Charlotte beat the Hawks 129-120 on Saturday night to snap a two-game skid. Jeremy Lamb had 24 points to help the Hornets win for the eighth time in their last 13 games. Walker, a three-time All-Star guard, is averaging 34 points and eight assists in his last four games. John Collins had 21 points and Trae Young added 20 for the Hawks. They have lost four of six. ""Kemba was doing what he's done all season,"" said Young, a rookie point guard. ""I didn't do a good job on him. I don't think I did a good job of talking, getting everybody to be where they needed to be. I've got to be better at doing that on both sides of the ball."" Miles Bridges' jumper, his sixth consecutive point, gave the Hornets their biggest lead at 19 in the final minute of the third before Devonte Graham's free throw made it 106-86. The Hornets got off to quick start, going up 23-13 after hitting their first eight field-goal attempts, including five from 3. It was big turnaround from the end of the loss at Dallas earlier in the week when they scored just seven points on their last 14 possessions. Charlotte led 41-25 when Bridges blocked DeAndre' Bembry's dunk attempt, dribbled up the court and passed to Nicolas Batum, who assisted on Cody Zeller's layup. The Hornets' biggest advantage in the first half was 17 on Walker's 3, but the Hawks pulled within five in the final minute on Taurean Prince's 3. Charlotte stayed in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. They won the season series 3-1. ""We knew how much we needed this game,"" Williams said. ""I think everybody's jockeying for playoff position now in both conferences."" TIP-INS Hornets: G Tony Parker was sidelined by a back strain. He is listed as day-to-day, but coach James Borrego said he should return for the next two games. ... Charlotte improved to 1-8 without Parker. All the losses came on the road. ... Zeller had 10 points and eight rebounds in his first start since Dec. 31. It was Zeller's third game back since he missed 17 games with a broken bone in his shooting hand. Hawks: Atlanta, rebuilding in hopes of getting a lottery pick, had no long-term answers on either end of the floor, but its defense was the biggest liability. After his team allowed 46 points in the first quarter and 73 in the first half, coach Lloyd Pierce called a timeout after his team pulled within two in third but left Lamb undefended on consecutive possessions that ended with a layup and a 3. The lead swelled to 11 a couple minutes later on Walker's 3, and Atlanta, despite pulling within eight of the lead midway through the fourth, didn't threaten again.","401071500"
"NEW YORK --  Marc Gasol felt like the new kid at school before his first game with the Toronto Raptors. To get ready, he spent time studying with Raptors assistant coach Sergio Scariolo -- who happens to be Gasol's coach on Spain's national team. ""Obviously I asked him a lot of questions about what should have been happening in each situation,"" Gasol said after a 104-99 win over the New York Knicks on Saturday night. ""But at the end of the day, it's about reads and reactions and understanding where you're going to get the ball and what kind of shot you're going to get,"" Gasol said. Gasol had seven points and six rebounds as Toronto sent the Knicks to their franchise record-tying 16th straight loss. Acquired from Memphis before Thursday's trade deadline, Gasol played 19 minutes. The three-time All-Star entered late in the first quarter and made a hook shot on his first try. The 7-footer, who spent his first 11 years in the league with the Grizzlies and is set to become a free agent at the conclusion of the season, was beaming about his new teammates. Gasol teamed up with Kyle Lowry for half a season in Memphis before the point guard moved on and developed himself into an All-Star with Toronto. And Gasol knows Kawhi Leonard well from their battles out in the Western Conference while Leonard was a member of the San Antonio Spurs. ""The mindset is all in. It's a clear goal, it's one goal and that's to play for a championship,"" Gasol said. Lowry scored 22 points and Serge Ibaka added 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Raptors. New York closed to 91-90 on a 3-pointer from Kadeem Allen with 5 minutes left. Danny Green hit back-to-back 3s to extend the lead 97-90. Mario Hezonja's 3-pointer with 11 seconds to go pulled the Knicks within 102-99. A pair of free throws from Lowry sealed it with eight seconds left. Green and Norman Powell each had 14 points for the Raptors, who have won their last three games, all on the road. Raptors coach Nick Nurse inserted Gasol into the game with 2:20 remaining in the first quarter. ""I think for a guy that hasn't been with us, you could see the offense moving pretty well,"" Nurse said. ""He's a guy who is in the right spots to keep things flowing. You throw it to him and there is cutting going on, there is flow to the offense."" Rookie Kevin Knox had 20 points and DeAndre Jordan had 10 points and 18 rebounds for a Knicks team that has not won a game since beating the Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 4. New York has lost 29 of its last 31. The Knicks last lost 16 straight games during the 2014-15 season. This year's squad, with three rookies and seven players with less than three years in the league, also extended a franchise-worst record of 16 consecutive losses on their home floor. ""We understand what this year is,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""Whatever happens to us this year will not make us crack or waver."" The Knicks took a 14-3 lead on Jordan's put-back dunk before the Raptors called a timeout. TIP-INS Raptors: Leonard returned to the lineup after missing Thursday's game at Atlanta due to a sore left knee. He scored 11 points, shooting 4-for-15 in 32 minutes. Knicks: Allen had a career-high 14 points and a career-best six assists in 28 minutes off the bench. . New York is 0-17 when scoring less than 100 points. . Rookie C Mitchell Robinson had a career-high 15 points and added seven rebounds in 22 minutes as a reserve. START SPREADING THE NEWS Leonard will be an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career and definitely a target of the rebuilding Knicks when the signing period opens up July 1. New York has enough room in its salary cap to sign two free agents to max contracts, but the low-key Raptors star, who will also be courted by a couple of other teams this summers, was quick to squash any potential free agency rumors in his first visit of the season to Madison Square Garden. ""Just playing my season right now,"" Leonard said. ""Just talk to people, see what I want to do."" Leonard spent some time in the New York area last year away from the Spurs while rehabbing. He credited the home crowd for supporting a team that dropped to a league-worst 10-45. ""They still come out and support the team even with a losing record,"" Leonard said. ""That's what you want, I guess, from an organization if you're playing for them."" A HELPING HAND Scariolo will definitely play a big role in Gasol's transitional period with so little practice dates left and 25 games remaining in the regular season before the playoffs start. The Italian assistant coach, who has led Spain's national team to three Eurobasket gold medals and a silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics and a bronze medal at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, glowed about some of the attributes that Toronto's prized acquisition brings to the court. ""He probably brings to this team something which they never had, a type of player who never was on this team,"" Scariolo said. ""Basically he is a great passer, someone who sees the next play a split-second before most of the opponents, most of the teammates as well, most of the coaches.""","401071501"
"BOSTON --  The ""Beat L.A.!"" chants turned to boos as the Boston Celtics blew another big lead to another Los Angeles team. One game after the Lakers rallied from 18 points down to win in Boston -- and six days after the Patriots beat the Rams in the Super Bowl -- the retooled Clippers erased a 28-point deficit on Saturday night to beat the Celtics 123-112. ""We didn't have it. We didn't have anything. To pull it out was special,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who led Boston to the 2008 NBA championship. ""We were taking notes already for the next game. That's how far we were out of it."" Montrezl Harrell, who scored 21 points, forced two turnovers in the final two minutes, and Patrick Beverley hit a pair of 3-pointers in front of the Boston bench to help the Clippers pull away. Danilo Gallinari had 19 points and 10 rebounds and trade deadline acquisition Landry Shamet scored 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. ""I learned a lot in a really short time about this team,"" said Shamet, who came from the 76ers in the deal that sent Clippers leading scorer Tobias Harris to Philadelphia. ""We played pretty well together for this being our first time as a group."" Gordon Hayward scored 19 points and Jayson Tatum and Terry Rozier had 16 apiece for Boston. The Celtics followed their highest-scoring half of the season with their lowest-scoring quarter, blowing a 28-point lead for the first time in 15 years. ""I guess it just kind of snowballs on you,"" Hayward said. ""It's the NBA, man, it's how it works."" The Celtics collapse corresponded to the loss of Kyrie Irving, who left with a sprained knee in the second quarter, when the game seemed comfortably in hand. Coach Brad Stevens said Irving would have more tests on Sunday. ""His knee buckled a little bit in the second quarter, and so that's all I know,"" he said. LOSING GROUND Boston scored 15 straight points and finished the first quarter with a 23-point lead, then extended it to 68-40 in the second. The Celtics led 74-53 at halftime, but the Clippers outscored them 28-12 in the third. Los Angeles finally tied it 100-all, bringing boos from the crowd that expected an easy victory against a team that added five new players at the trade deadline. Gallinari followed with a jumper to give the Clippers their first lead. The Celtics were down by a point when Marcus Smart missed a 3-pointer, then tried to take a charge on Harrell but didn't get the whistle. The Boston guard was on the floor, hoping for a call, when Beverley hit his first 3. Harrell followed by stealing the ball from Hayward, then bounding down the court with a Celtic on either side before going in for a two-handed dunk that made it 114-107. After Tatum hit a 3, Beverley answered, and then Harrell poked another ball free to preserve the lead. KYRIE OUT Irving left with 2 1/2 minutes left in the second quarter after spraining his right knee while weaving through traffic on defense. Boston led by 20 at the time, and the team quickly announced that he would not return. Irving finished with 14 points and two assists in 14 minutes. He missed the last 15 games and all of the playoffs last year with injuries to his left knee. BEAT L.A. The game was the last in a rivalry week for Boston and Los Angeles that began with the Super Bowl. The Celtics lost to the Lakers on Thursday night, and the Bruins beat the Los Angeles Kings earlier Saturday 5-4 in overtime. The Red Sox also beat the Dodgers in the World Series, back in October. NEW FACES Garrett Temple, Ivica Zubac, JaMychal Green and Shamet all made their debuts for the Clippers after being acquired by Los Angeles at the trade deadline. Temple scored 11 points, Zubac had 12 with nine rebounds and Green scored 2. TIP-INS Clippers: Monday's game against the Timberwolves completes a six-game trip, during which the team will have traveled approximately 6,659 miles -- the fifth-most in the league this season, according to travelmath.com. They improved to 3-2 on the trip. ... The 42 points in the fourth quarter tied a season-high for any quarter. Celtics: Fell to 22-8 at home. The Celtics went 25 for 31 from the free throw line, snapping a streak of two straight games without missing a foul shot. ... They shot 4 for 22 from the floor in the third quarter.","401071502"
"CHICAGO --  Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker hugged and smiled after they departed with 42 seconds left. It was a nice little party for Portis on the eve of his 24th birthday. Bradley Beal scored 31 points for Washington, helping Portis and Parker make a successful return to Chicago and leading the Wizards to a 134-125 victory over the Bulls on Saturday night. ""Games like this, you know, guys always have circled when guys are traded,"" Beal said. ""You face the team that traded you, you always want to get a win for those guys. So we came with that mentality tonight."" The Wizards got Parker, Portis and a protected 2023 second-round pick from the Bulls on Wednesday for Otto Porter Jr. Parker scored 20 points and Portis had 10 points and 12 rebounds against their former team, helping Washington to a 64-38 advantage in bench points. Portis took the trade particularly hard. He was selected by Chicago in the first round of the 2015 draft and spent his first three-plus seasons with the Bulls. ""I got my first taste of the business side of basketball,"" said Portis, who scored 30 points in Washington's 119-106 victory over Cleveland on Friday night. ""You don't really get your way all the time. It's not really your choice. I have to roll with it now. ""I was hurt the last, what, 48 hours, but when I got into the game yesterday those hurt emotions went away."" Washington shot 58 percent (55 for 95) from the field and placed seven players in double figures in the opener of a four-game road trip. Chassan Randle scored a career-high 20 points, and Trevor Ariza finished with 19. Zach LaVine scored 26 points for Chicago, which kicked off a three-game homestand with its seventh loss in nine games. Lauri Markkanen had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Porter finished with 17 points on 6-for-15 shooting. ""It was a little emotional playing against my former team, but once the ball went up all of that went out the window,"" Porter said. The Bulls trailed by 17 early in the second half, but Ryan Arcidiacono made two foul shots to trim Washington's lead to 108-102 with 10:57 left in the fourth. The Wizards then pulled away with a 12-2 run. Parker opened the sequence with a driving dunk and Wesley Johnson made a 3-pointer.

""Jabari, he brings a lot of force to our second unit right now,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""Makes plays, he's a playmaker. He's really good. We're lucky to have him."" Parker was 9 for 15 from the field. He also had six assists and five rebounds. ""He looked energized,"" LaVine said. ""They put him in the right position to be successful.""

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  On a night where new faces sprinkled Memphis' rotation, an old vet carried the Grizzlies to their first victory of a new era. Joakim Noah had season highs of 19 points and 14 rebounds to lead the new-look Grizzlies to a 99-90 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night. ""Ton of credit to Joakim,"" Memphis coach said about Noah -- in his 11th season and first with Memphis. ""He had a flashback to a few years ago. He was all over the place, and I think he led the charge with his energy."" Justin Holiday had 15 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. finished with 14 points, 10 of them in the fourth. C.J. Miles, playing his first game for Memphis added 13 points to help the Grizzlies win for the third time in four games. With three new players in the rotation, along with more minutes for former reserves, the Memphis offense was not very fluid early. The defense struggled, too, as New Orleans shot 61 percent in the first quarter. ""I think all the guys, they just wanted to come in and be effective on offense and defense,"" said center Ivan Rabb, who had 10 points and nine rebounds. ""I feel like we got off to a slow start because our communication wasn't there. Once we picked it up at the end of the first quarter and going into the second, we looked totally different."" Julius Randle led the Pelicans with 21 points, and Jrue Holiday added 15. Anthony Davis had 14 points and 16 rebounds in his second game returning to the lineup after seeking a trade. The smoother communication as the game progressed benefited the Memphis defense. After connecting on 11 of 18 shots in the first quarter, New Orleans went 15 of 50 over the next two frames, scoring only 34 points. ""I think we had too many dribble tantrums,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said, `where we would just dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble. This is not the team you do that against because they are very good at getting into the ball."" Memphis used the Pelicans struggles in the middle two quarters to carry a 10-point lead into the fourth. The lead would eventually stretch to 12 in the closing minutes as the Pelicans saw their two-game winning streak snapped. And even though players across the league are familiar with each other's games, it is a bit of adjustment to see them playing in different roles on a new team, said Pelicans forward Kenrich Williams, who had 10 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. ""We didn't even know who was starting until about 10 minutes before the game,"" Williams said. ""So, that's kind of tough. But you can't make excuses. You've got to go out there and get it done."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Jahlil Okafor missed his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. ... Davis, who did not play in the fourth quarter of Friday's win over Minnesota after reaching 25 minutes, played 8 minutes in the final frame against Memphis. ... Made only 6 of 33 from 3-point range, New Orleans' second-worst performance from outside the arc this season. Grizzlies: Jonas Valanciunas, acquired in Thursday's trade for Marc Gasol, did not play. ... Avery Bradley, acquired from the Clippers on Thursday, got the start in his first game with Memphis. ... Noah's previous season high in points was 13 against the Pelicans in New Orleans on Dec. 7. His previous high in rebounds was 11 at Charlotte on Feb. 1. A LOOK-IN AT TORONTO The Toronto Raptors played in New York against the Knicks on Saturday night, and Conley acknowledged he took a quick look at the television at halftime to see how Gasol, his long-time running mate, was doing. ""I just smiled and looked at him and said: `He's actually there. He's gone (from Memphis),"" Conley said. ""He looked like he was in good spirits and happy. You don't realize how much you miss somebody until they're gone.""","401071504"
"HOUSTON --  Paul George said it took a fiery halftime discussion to help the Oklahoma City Thunder overcome the largest deficit they've seen all season. ""We just knew we had to have a better second half,"" George said. ""Being down that much at the half, that's not the team we are. We know this team very well and we knew that wasn't us. So we had to come in here and talk and just light a fire under this team and we did that."" George scored 45 points, Russell Westbrook matched the NBA record with his ninth straight triple-double and Oklahoma City overcame a 26-point deficit to beat the Houston Rockets 117-112 on Saturday night. It was Oklahoma City's largest comeback victory. ""We just never got into any flow, but then I thought once we got some stops, we got out in transition,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Obviously, Paul with what he did tonight was phenomenal, the way he played. And he was on (James) Harden a lot. He was unbelievable tonight on both ends of the floor."" Defensively, George fought through screens in the final minute to stay on Harden. ""I look forward to playing against the best,"" George said. ""That's how I was taught the game -- just enjoy matchups and have fun with it."" Westbrook had 21 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds to match the record streak set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1968. Westbrook has 22 triple-doubles this season and 126 overall. He also had 10 turnovers and was 8 of 21 from the field. ""It's really incredible,"" Donovan said. ""It took whatever it was, 60 years, until somebody did it just to show you how hard it is to do and how unique of a player he is to be able to do it."" Harden led the Rockets with 42 points, reaching 30 points for the 29th straight game -- two shy of Chamberlain for the second-longest streak in NBA history, but far behind Chamberlain's record run of 65 games. Harden was 11 for 28 from the field, going 6 of 16 from 3-point range, and made 14 of 15 free throws. The 26-point deficit was Oklahoma City's largest of the season. Westbrook gave the Thunder a one-point lead with a driving layup with 26.9 seconds remaining. On the following possession, Harden missed a 3-pointer, and George got the rebound and was fouled with 3.4 seconds left. He made both free throws put Oklahoma City up three. Houston turned it over on the following inbound play. George made 12 of 22 shots, hit 6 of 14 3-pointers and made 15 of 18 free throws to finish four points shy of his career-high 49 points set in 2013 with Indiana. The Thunder made seven of their first eight shots in the third quarter to quickly cut Houston's lead in half. Oklahoma City outscored Houston 42-20 in the quarter to even the score at 90. ""We knew to get back into the game, we had to defend at a high level,"" Westbrook said. ""We got stops and won a big game on the road."" Oklahoma City fell into a deep hole in the first half following a sizzling second quarter from the Rockets. After dominating Sacramento 44-17 in the second quarter of a 127-101 win in their previous game on Wednesday night, the Rockets outscored the Thunder 42-23 on Saturday night. ""We have to be consistent for four quarters,"" Harden said. ""It's pretty simple."" Houston had won seven of eight home games against Oklahoma City. ""They're a good team and they played well,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We had our chances. We just didn't finish off. We came out flat the second half for whatever reason. Maybe being up 22 did it, I don't know."" Dennis Schroder had 17 points off the bench for Oklahoma City. Iman Shumpert, acquired by Houston from Sacramento ahead of the trade deadline, made a 3-pointer from the corner on his second shot attempt and finished with three points in 24 minutes. ""He'll help us defensively,"" D'Antoni said. ""I thought he may have gotten a little tired in the second half, but the first half, he was a dog out there. It was good. There are a lot of positive things."" TIP-INS Thunder: Reserve SG Alex Abrines was released Saturday, with the Thunder citing personal reasons. Abrines appeared in just two games since Dec. 23, sitting out because of undisclosed personal reasons. In 31 games this season, Abrines averaged 5.3 points. Rockets: Houston was outrebounded 53-39. The Rockets fell to 8-5 without leading rebounder Clint Capela. He has a right thumb injury. ... Kenneth Faried had 17 points and 12 rebounds.","401071505"
"MILWAUKEE --  With Giannis Antetokounmpo on the bench in street clothes, the Milwaukee Bucks had their lowest scoring output of the season and fell flat. ""We'll probably throw this one in the trash can and move on,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We just didn't have it tonight."" Antetokounmpo sat out with right knee soreness after scoring 29 points and grabbing 17 rebounds in Milwaukee's win over Dallas on Friday night. His absence was clearly felt in a listless 103-83 blowout loss to the Orlando Magic on Saturday night that snapped the Bucks' six-game winning streak. Jonathan Isaac scored 17 points and Nikola Vucevic and Terrence Ross each added 15 for Orlando. Vucevic also pulled down 17 rebounds. ""Obviously, without Giannis it is a different team. He is a huge part because he brings so much attention,"" Vucevic said. ""You have to game plan just for him. It did help a little bit that he wasn't out there because he is such a great player. I am glad that we took care of business and we got this win."" Aaron Gordon chipped in 14 points as Orlando prevented Milwaukee form sweeping the three-game season series. The Bucks, who have the league's best record at 41-14, lost for just the second time in 14 games. ""They played hard, they hit shots. They made us uncomfortable,"" Bucks forward Khris Middleton said. The Magic led by as many as 25 in the fourth quarter and clamped down on defense, especially in the second half, to stymie the Bucks high-powered offense. Milwaukee's previous low point total was 87 in a loss to Miami on Dec. 22. ""I thought in the second half we did a lot better job just keeping the ball out of the paint,"" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said. Eric Bledsoe had 19 points and Malcolm Brogdon 14 for Milwaukee, which shot just 33 percent overall and made only six of 35 shots from 3-point range, tying their fewest number of 3s made in a game this season. ""I'm thinking everybody was tired,"" Bledsoe said. ""We had no legs. We missed a lot of threes."" The Bucks took an early 8-0 lead, but Orlando answered with a 20-4 run and held a 20-19 lead after the first quarter. Milwaukee shot just 30 percent in the period. Orlando led 59-49 at the half, shooting 53 percent. TIP-INS Magic: Ross had 13 points in the second quarter. ... Rookie C Mo Bamba missed a fourth straight game with a stress fracture of his left tibia. Bucks: Middleton returned after sitting out Friday night to rest. ... With Antetokounmpo out, Tony Snell started. ... Scored a season-low 15 third-quarter points. The team's previous low was 17 on Oct. 22 against the Knicks. GIANNIS SITS Antetokounmpo missed his fourth game this season. ""The soreness and the pounding of his body is pretty significant,"" Budenholzer said. ""I don't think it's a long-term thing, but I think a back-to-back, and the loads his puts himself through for us, he needs this."" MIROTIC ARRIVES Nikola Mirotic, acquired from New Orleans in a three-team trade near the trading deadline, donned a Bucks uniform for the first time but didn't see action as he continues to recover from a right calf strain. The fifth-year forward missed his last seven games with the Pelicans and wasn't with the Bucks for their game at Dallas on Friday. ""We were very, very excited for him to be in our gym this morning, shooting and working,"" Budenholzer said. ""We'll just see how the next days go."" MORE THAN A SCORER With a reputation as a sharpshooter, Mirotic is eager to show his new Bucks teammates that he can do more than score. ""They want somebody who will spread the floor, someone who can shoot,"" Mirotic said before the game. ""There is much more I can do. This year has been (my) best year for rebounding. I am not just a shooter."" Budenholzer concurred. ""He can make shots from deep. As a big guy, he can also be a playmaker,"" Budenholzer said. ""He's just a really versatile player. I also think there's a toughness to him that's underappreciated. He's shown to be a better defender than people give him credit for.""","401071506"
"DALLAS --  Luka Doncic was summoned back to the court for a very brief speech to a group of about 100 Slovenians who made the 24-hour trek to see their countryman, the teenage rookie sensation for the Dallas Mavericks. The bigger thrill for the visitors came a little earlier when Doncic helped engineer a fourth-quarter comeback against the playoff-contending Portland Trail Blazers. Doncic scored 13 of his 28 points in the fourth, Tim Hardaway Jr. finished with 24 and the Mavericks erased a 15-point deficit in the final 10 minutes for a 102-101 victory Sunday. ""I don't normally play him the whole quarter, but when we began to make the push early in the fourth it was just one those times where he was going to have to finish for us to have a chance,"" said coach Rick Carlisle, whose team matched its biggest comeback of the season. Damian Lillard scored 21 of his 30 points in the last half of the third quarter to help the Blazers build a lead that grew to 96-81 early in the fourth before the Mavericks rallied to hand Portland its first loss in 34 games when leading after three quarters this season. Lillard made eight straight shots and in one stretch scored 16 straight Portland points in the third, but the All-Star guard missed his last four attempts as the Blazers went 10:10 without a field goal in a nine-point fourth quarter. The last miss from Lillard was a driving layup in the final seconds after Doncic had missed at the other end, and Dallas' Maxi Kleber hunched over with the rebound and hung on long enough for time to expire. ""Some missed opportunities, some turnovers, some poor decisions, and you have got to give Dallas a lot of credit,"" said Portland coach Terry Stotts, whose team entered the game with a 33-0 record when leading after three quarters this season. ""They play with a lot of energy."" There is plenty of debate over whether the Mavericks still want to make the playoffs after trading the other four starters around Doncic in a pair of deals that were clearly about the future over the present. Three of the starters went to New York, and the Mavericks have decided not to play the centerpiece of that deal. They instead plan to let 2018 All-Star Kristaps Porzingis continue his recovery from a knee injury sustained about a year ago with the Knicks. Hardaway was the second-biggest part of the deal for Dallas, and had his best showing in his third game. With the intensity of the rally building, he won a scramble for a loose ball and weaved through defenders for an emphatic left-handed dunk to get Dallas within one. Doncic gave the Mavericks their first lead since early in the second quarter with a finger-roll layup, then the 19-year-old put them ahead for good with a 3-point play on a driving layup for a 102-99 lead with 1:28 remaining. After CJ McCollum made a shot, the teams exchanged misses before Lillard's last-second attempt in the third loss in the past 10 games for Portland. ""I just think it's a message because they're a team that's below .500 right now,"" Lillard said. ""They just had a trade. They got all new guys and things like that, and it's a game that we should be able to win."" Justuf Nurkic had 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting and 10 rebounds before fouling out when Hardaway got the Mavericks to 97-all on free throws. They had been even at 67 in the third before Lillard took over and gave the Blazers a comfortable lead. Dwight Powell had 13 points and eight rebounds, including an alley-oop dunk from Doncic that kicked the comeback into another gear while getting Dallas within six. Doncic had nine rebounds and six assists. Dorian Finney-Smith started the game-ending 21-5 run by tipping in his own miss and finished with 11 points and six boards. TIP-INS Blazers: McCollum was just 6 of 17 from the field and finished with 14 points, ending his career-best streak of three straight games with at least 30 points. ... The Blazers had a double-digit lead in the first half as well after going on a 20-1 run. Mavericks: C Salah Mejri was re-signed three days after being waived as part of the trade that sent Harrison Barnes to Sacramento. ... Hardaway reached 5,000 career points with two buckets in the first quarter. His next two baskets were 3-pointers to give him 700 for his career. SLOVENIAN FIELD TRIP The group of Slovenians will see the Mavericks in Houston again Monday and Wednesday when Miami plays in Dallas. It's the first time a large group has traveled from their home country. There were local Slovenian contingents in Cleveland and New York. The idea was for this group to see the Slovenian showdown between Doncic and Goran Dragic, teammates on the national team. But Dragic hasn't played since Dec. 10 because of a right knee injury that required surgery. He isn't expected back until after the All-Star break.","401071507"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Magic Johnson and LeBron James have captured eight NBA titles between them. With Johnson in the stands and James on the court, the Philadelphia 76ers showed off their own championship potential. Joel Embiid had 37 points and 14 rebounds, Tobias Harris scored 22 points in his second game with Philadelphia, and the new-look 76ers beat James and the Los Angeles Lakers 143-120 on Sunday. JJ Redick added 21 points for the Sixers, who have won two straight after acquiring Harris and four others at Thursday's trade deadline. Jimmy Butler finished with 15 points in front of a packed Philly crowd that brought a playoff-like feel to the nationally televised game. ""The East better watch out,"" said Johnson, the Lakers president who made the trip to Philly for the game. ""This is a stacked team."" Kyle Kuzma led the Lakers with 39 points while James had 18 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. James was facing Philadelphia for the first time since the Sixers made a big push to sign the superstar as a free agent last summer. He and Kuzma both missed the last matchup with Philly on Jan. 29, which the Sixers won 121-105. ""I thought they were going to be very good anyway before they made any moves, before the season even started,"" James said. ""And they've made a bunch of moves to improve their club."" Fresh off a buzzer-beating win at Boston, the Lakers shot nearly 60 percent and scored 40 points in the first quarter. But fueled by Redick's four-point play, the Sixers closed the first half on a 19-6 run to take a 76-67 lead into halftime. Embiid, who was questionable to play because of gastroenteritis, led the charge with 25 points in the first half after lighting up the Lakers for 28 in the teams' first matchup. ""I must not be a big LA fan,"" said Embiid, who had his league-leading 23rd game with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. ""It's fun. I've been more consistent against both LA teams."" Philadelphia's lead ballooned to 109-94 at the end of the third quarter after T.J. McConnell's 3-pointer in the closing seconds. The Sixers ran away with the game from there while gleeful fans chanted ""Kobe's better"" at James. ""We had too many breakdowns,"" James said. ""Way too many breakdowns."" TIP-INS Lakers: Johnson said before the game that he didn't believe the New Orleans Pelicans engaged in good-faith negotiations at the trade deadline during the Lakers' pursuit of Anthony Davis. Johnson added that the LA players who were on the trade block are professionals who are capable of moving forward. ""This is how this league works,"" he said. ""They know it. I know it."" ... Mike Muscala, one of two players the Lakers acquired at the deadline, had eight points in 13 minutes against the team he spent the first half of the season with before being dealt. ... Coach Luke Walton said Josh Hart was available after dealing with knee tendinitis, but the former Villanova star did not get into the game. 76ers: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, film director M. Night Shyamalan, New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft and Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout were in attendance. So was new Philadelphia Union midfielder and Mexican national team star Marco Fabian, who swapped jerseys with fellow Philly newcomer Harris after the game. ... The Sixers scored at least 33 points in each quarter -- the first time the team has done so since 1986. ... Philly finished with 33 assists and seven turnovers. SIMMONS BELIEVES IN MAGIC Johnson revealed that Simmons has reached out to the Lakers about working out with him this summer to learn more about playing the ""position as a big guard."" Pending league approval, Johnson noted he'd be happy to accommodate such a wish. ""I love his game,"" Johnson said. ""I love his vision."" Said Simmons: ""Trying to learn from somebody like that would be huge."" SIMMONS FOR 3?!? Perhaps the most surprising part of the game came one minute into the second half when Simmons attempted just his third 3-pointer of the season -- and the first that wasn't an end-of-clock heave. ""I wasn't shocked by it,"" Redick said, before Embiid turned to him and replied, ""You sure?"" The shot rimmed out as much of the crowd gasped. Simmons has never made a 3 in his two seasons in the NBA, but believes he'll have more opportunities to expand his game with Harris joining a star-studded starting lineup alongside him, Redick, Butler and Embiid. ""With this new five I think it's going to be exciting in terms of what we can do,"" Simmons said. ""I'm just trying to take what they give me.""","401071508"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Marvin Bagley III was more than a little excited playing against Phoenix for the first time. The Sacramento rookie grew up in Tempe, Arizona, and was briefly high school teammates with the Suns' Deandre Ayton. Phoenix passed over Bagley with the No. 1 overall pick in last summer's draft, taking Ayton instead. Bagley fell to the Kings at No. 2 -- a little added motivation there, too. Bagley had another strong game off the bench with a career-high 32 points and six rebounds, and Sacramento beat Phoenix 117-104 on Sunday to hand the Suns their 14th straight loss. ""I love playing against the Suns,"" said Bagley, who missed the Kings first two games against Phoenix due to a knee injury. ""It's fun playing against Deandre, the whole organization, everybody involved. I got to meet them when I went there for my pre-draft work and I met a few of those guys. So it was good competing against them."" Buddy Hield scored 18 points, De'Aaron Fox had 17 points and nine assists, and Nemanja Bjelica added 10 points and eight rebounds to help Sacramento to its fifth win in six games. The Kings inched closer to ending the longest current playoff drought in the NBA. Sacramento, which last made the postseason in 2005-06, pulled within a half-game of the idle Los Angeles Clippers for the final playoff spot in the West. It's also the fastest the Kings (30-26) have reached 30 wins since 2004-05 when they did it in 43 games. ""We have this goal in our heads about getting to the playoffs and it's getting close right now,"" Bagley said. ""Every game matters. I'm excited, after we get done with this next game, how we come back from break and see where we can go from there."" Devin Booker had 27 points, eight rebounds and six assists in his return from injury for Phoenix. Ayton added 16 points and nine rebounds. The Suns' losing streak is one shy of its franchise record of 15 set last season. They'll try to avoid matching that dubious mark Wednesday against the Clippers. ""The Kings came better prepared, more ready and more aggressive,"" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We said before the game that they were going to throw the first punch hard at us. We were not ready to accept that punch."" Bagley had his best game as a pro while dominating in the paint. The second overall pick in the draft, Bagley shot 10 of 15 and went 11 for 13 from the free-throw line. He also scored Sacramento's first 12 points in the fourth quarter, including a driving 360-degree spinning layup. ""He's doing what we knew he could do in the beginning,"" Kings center Willie Cauley-Stein said. ""It's really on him. He's getting the time, he's putting in the work and it's showing. TIP-INS Suns: Jackson scored six straight points in the third on a free throw, dunk and 3-pointer. He was also called for a technical foul in the same period. ... Booker returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games because of right hamstring tightness. He had a scare in the third quarter when he banged knees with Bogdan Bogdanovic and limped off the court, but he came back to start the fourth and promptly made a 3-pointer. Kings: Sacramento had only two turnovers in the first half. ... Fox spent much of the first quarter on the bench after picking up his second foul early. FINISHING WHAT THEY START The Kings are 4-1 this season in games when they lead by 15 or more at halftime. The only blemish was a 115-11 loss to the Suns in Phoenix on Jan. 8 when Sacramento blew a 19-point lead at the break.","401071509"
"ATLANTA --  Nikola Vucevic played like an All-Star. Jonathan Isaac turned one possession into his own personal block party. And the Orlando Magic picked off road victories on back-to-back nights for the first time in nearly five years. Vucevic, who will be making his first All-Star Game appearance next weekend in Charlotte, scored 19 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the Magic to a 124-108 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night. Despite getting into Atlanta around 2:40 a.m. after a 20-point victory at East-leading Milwaukee the previous night, Orlando looked like the fresher team by far in recording its third straight victory, matching its best run of the season. The last time the Magic pulled off road wins on consecutive nights was April 3-4, 2014, when they defeated Minnesota 97-90 and Milwaukee 97-84. ""We really played well,"" Vucevic said. ""We took the lead and we never looked back."" The Magic began to pull away late in the first half, ripping off an 11-2 run that sent the road team to the locker room with a 63-48 lead -- its biggest of the game to that point. D.J. Augustin finished off the spurt, racing the length of the court after a couple of Atlanta free throws to lay one in with 1.2 seconds left. Atlanta's Trae Young hit a desperation shot from just inside the halfcourt line, but he clearly released the ball after the buzzer. That pretty much epitomized the night for the Hawks, who lost their third straight game at State Farm Arena -- giving up an average of 124 points in those defeats ""Our offense wasn't there too much,"" Atlanta's Kevin Huerter said. ""But I think our biggest problem is on the defensive end."" Orlando kept up the onslaught after halftime, scoring 12 of the first 14 points and pushing the lead as high as 26 points in the third quarter. The Magic led 98-74 at the end of the period, sending plenty of fans to the exits. Vucevic led seven players in double figures, including the entire starting five. Isaac and Evan Fournier each had 17 points. But Isaac really shined at the defensive end -- especially during a single possession midway through the second quarter. When John Collins attempted to lay one in from right under the basket, Isaac got a hand on it. Collins snatched the offensive rebound, went up again -- and was stuffed again by Isaac. The Hawks grabbed another offensive rebound, worked the ball around the perimeter before going inside a third time to Collins. Yep, same result. Isaac got a hand on the ball for his third block in a span of roughly 10 seconds. Isaac finished with five blocks. Orlando came into the night 2 1/2 games behind Miami for the final playoff spot in the East. The Magic haven't made the playoffs since 2012. ""We're playing for something,"" Augustin said. ""Tonight was all about fighting, fighting through fatigue."" Alex Len led the Hawks with 16 points, despite picking up four fouls in the first half. CORBIN HONORED During the first timeout of the game, the Hawks honored Orlando assistant Tyrone Corbin with a video tribute as part of Atlanta's 50th anniversary celebration marking the team's move from St. Louis before the 1968-69 season. Corbin played in 277 games over two separate stints with the Hawks in the 1990s, helping the team to four playoff appearances. LEN'S ROUGH PATCH The Hawks center bounced back from a rough first half. First, he managed to pick up four fouls in just under 9 minutes of playing time. Perhaps more embarrassing for the 7-foot-1 Len, both of his shot attempts were blocked by a pair of 6-9 players. A short jumper was swatted away by Khem Birch and an attempted dunk was stuffed by Aaron Gordon. Len bounced back in the second half to shoot 4-of-5, including a pair of 3-pointers, and didn't pick up any additional fouls. Not that it mattered. TIP INS Magic: Eight players connected from beyond the 3-point arc, led by Isaac's 3-of-7 performance. ... Augustin had 10 assists to go with 14 points. Hawks: The starting frontcourt had a rough night. Collins led the way with 15 points on 5-of-12 shooting, while Taurean Prince was held to eight points and Dewayne Dedmon managed only five. ... Atlanta was outrebounded 49-33.","401071510"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  A lackluster start for Golden State turned into a frantic finish and another win thanks to a big shooting night from Kevin Durant. Durant hit a game-tying 3-pointer in the final minute as part of a 39-point night and DeMarcus Cousins made two free throws with 5.4 seconds to play that helped the Warriors cap a comeback from a 19-point deficit in the first quarter to beat the Miami Heat 120-118 on Sunday. ""We started off sluggish,"" Durant said. ""They made shots, they were excited to play against us. We treated it like it was a Sunday walk in the park. ... After a while we just locked in."" Durant was a big reason why, scoring 11 straight points for Golden State down the stretch before finally missing a late 3-pointer that Cousins corralled for a rebound and drew a foul on the put-back attempt that gave the Warriors their 11th double-digit comeback of the season, and second straight after rallying from 17 points down in the first quarter Friday in Phoenix. The Heat were upset because they believed Durant double-dribbled before that late attempt and that there was a 26-8 free throw disparity in Golden State's favor. ""Those are tough calls to make, but everybody saw it. It's right there in front of everybody,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Durant losing the handle and starting to dribble again. ""That should be a violation and you can't miss those calls. But we had our chances, it was back and forth."" Miami overcame an eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter to tie the game on a 3-pointer by Justise Winslow. Josh Richardson and Dwyane Wade then had back-to-back steals and layups to put the Heat up 118-115 with 51.5 seconds to play. Durant then tied it with a 3-pointer and Cousins made his big shots after both teams missed from long range to give the Warriors their 15th win in 16 games. ""I was really happy that he was out there at the end of the game,"" coach Steve Kerr said of Cousins, playing his 10th game for Golden State.  ""It's good experiences for him because he hasn't been out there much since he's come back to close games."" Klay Thompson scored 29 points and Stephen Curry added 25 for Golden State. Richardson finished with a career-high 37 points with help from eight 3-pointers. Waiters added 24 and Winslow had 22 in Miami's fifth loss in six games. ""No moral victories really in this game, but we played pretty well and we lost a close one,"" Winslow said. ""Some things were out of our control, but the way we competed was what you like to see out of a team."" The Heat went on a 24-2 run early in the first quarter and quickly built a 19-point lead against the slow-starting Warriors. But Golden State scored the final six points of the frame to cut the deficit to 10 points after one. The Warriors went on a 12-0 run early in the third quarter starting with a 3-pointer from Curry to take a 66-61 lead and the game stayed close from there. TIP-INS Heat: Wade played despite a scary fall Friday in Sacramento that left him with a bruised back. ""Any one of us would probably be in a body brace right now. But he's built like Captain America,"" Spoelstra said. Wade got a standing ovation following a video tribute during the first quarter timeout in his final regular-season game in the Bay Area before retiring after the season. Wade finished with 10 points and exchanged jerseys with Curry after the game. ""It was an amazing video tribute,"" he said. ""They really put some thought into that. Afterward I said to my teammates, `That was dope.' That was a great tribute."" Warriors: F Andre Iguodala sat out after tweaking his left hamstring on Friday. ... The Warriors have scored at least 100 points in 26 straight games, their longest streak since a 36-gamer in 2016-17. ... Draymond Green was called for his 11th technical foul early in the fourth quarter when he wanted a goaltending called when Bam Adebayo blocked Shaun Livingston's shot. Durant was called for his 10th later in the quarter. FREE AGENCY TALK The Warriors have grown tired of talk about NBA free agency, but Kerr was happy to chime in when it came to baseball's market. When asked about the possibility that free agent slugger Bryce Harper could sign with the San Francisco Giants, the noted Los Angeles Dodgers fan was all in favor of it. ""I'd love it if Bryce Harper came here,"" Kerr said. ""Does my opinion matter? Bryce, come to the Giants. Let's go!""","401071511"
"CLEVELAND --  The New York Knicks' franchise-record 17th straight loss might have been the toughest one to take. The Knicks erased a 17-point deficit in the second half and had several chances to take the lead or tie the game in the final minute before falling to the Cleveland Cavaliers 107-104 on Monday night. ""It's incredibly hard,"" said guard Dennis Smith Jr. ""No one wants to lose, especially 17 in a row. Tonight would've been major for us if we'd have pulled it out."" Collin Sexton, who led Cleveland with 20 points, hit two free throws with 17 seconds remaining to put the Cavaliers up by three. John Jenkins missed a 3-pointer from the right corner, but Smith grabbed the rebound and dribbled to the left corner. He also missed a 3-pointer and Larry Nance Jr. tapped the rebound to midcourt as time ran out. Luke Kornet, who hit a pair of 3-pointers down the stretch, missed a wide-open 3 with 21 seconds remaining that would have put the Knicks ahead. ""When you've got a chance at the end, if you don't win, it hurts,"" coach David Fizdale said. ""We had a shot -- actually two -- and we got the look we wanted. It just didn't go down. And before that, we got a real good look from one of our best shooters in Kornet."" Nance had 15 points and 16 rebounds, while Jordan Clarkson scored 15 points. Kevin Love had 14 points and nine rebounds in his second game since returning from foot surgery. The All-Star forward played 16 minutes, all in the first half. Love was 4 of 10 from the field, including two 3-pointers, and had nine rebounds. Love played Friday against Washington after missing 50 games. He scored four points in six first-quarter minutes. ""I felt like the last game I wasn't able to open up my lungs like I was tonight,"" Love said. ""It felt pretty good to get out there and feel like I got in some sort of rhythm."" Love said he thinks he'll play Wednesday against Brooklyn in Cleveland's final game before the All-Star break. ""He's doing some things that we've really missed over his absence,"" coach Larry Drew said. ""You can put him in the post and he can manufacture a shot and get to the free throw line. He moves out to the 3 against a bigger guy. He looks good. He's moving very well."" Kadeem Allen scored a career-high 25 points for the Knicks. New York (10-46) has the worst record in the league, and has lost 25 of 26 and 30 of its last 32 games. Cleveland (12-45) broke a four-game losing streak. Kevin Knox scored 13 points while DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 10 rebounds for New York. Both teams are in the running for a prime spot in the draft lottery, which takes place May 14. The three worst teams in the league will have a 14 percent chance of getting the first pick in the draft and a shot at grabbing Duke center Zion Williamson. Phoenix (11-47) and Chicago (13-44) are also possibilities for a top-three pick. The Cavaliers led wire-to-wire and jumped to an 8-0 lead, leading Fizdale to use a timeout less than 90 seconds into the game. The Knicks, who traded injured star Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas on Jan. 31, have their longest skid within one season. New York lost 20 in a row over two seasons, March 23-Nov. 9, 1985. TIP-INS Knicks: Jenkins was signed to a 10-day contract earlier in the day. He scored seven points in nine minutes. .. G Emmanuel Mudiay (strained left shoulder) and G Frank Ntilikina (sore groin) remain out. Cavaliers: F Tristan Thompson (sore left foot) likely won't play until after the All-Star break. He has missed the last 12 games. ... F Cedi Osman (sprained right ankle) was out for the fourth straight game. .... C Ante Zizic (sore lower back) was a late scratch. THAT'S A LONG STREAK The Knicks' loss gives them the 34th losing streak of at least 17 games in NBA history and the longest skid since the Memphis Grizzlies dropped 19 in a row last season. New York hasn't won since a 119-112 victory over the Lakers on Jan. 4. A WIN Cleveland won for the first time this season with Love on the floor. He played the first four games in the Cavaliers' 0-6 start and returned for Friday's loss in Washington.","401071512"
"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons are enjoying one of their best stretches of the season, and the reason why is no surprise. Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond are rolling. Drummond had 32 points and 17 rebounds, and Griffin had 31 points, nine rebounds and nine assists to lift the Pistons to a 121-112 victory over the Washington Wizards on Monday night. Detroit has won four in a row, one shy of its longest winning streak of the season. ""It's incredible. They're playing the way we obviously need them to play,"" said Luke Kennard, who added 15 points for the Pistons. ""Obviously, Dre in the last couple games has been unbelievable. Reggie (Jackson) the past couple weeks has been great for us. Obviously, Blake all year has been really, really consistent."" Griffin scored 20 points in the first half for the Pistons, who haven't lost since blowing a 25-point lead in a home defeat against the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 2. Detroit began Monday tied with Miami for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards, who are without injured John Wall and Dwight Howard, traded Otto Porter Jr. away last week. Nevertheless, they came into the game on a two-game winning streak before falling short against Detroit. Griffin and Drummond have averaged 26 points apiece during Detroit's streak. ""We knew their power at the 4 and the 5 -- they are as strong as anyone in the league at those two spots,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""When Blake puts his head down, it is almost impossible to stop him from getting to the basket, but now he can step back and hit 3-pointers."" The Pistons led by 10 in the first quarter. They were up 61-59 at halftime before pushing the lead back into double digits in the third. Detroit went on a 13-2 run and took an 81-71 advantage on a 3-pointer by recently acquired center Thon Maker. Bradley Beal had 32 points and 10 assists for the Wizards. ""We gave them way too many points in the paint, especially early on, so we were always trying to fight back into the game,"" Beal said. ""This was an important night for us to take care of business, and we didn't get it done."" TIP-INS Wizards: Bobby Portis had 24 points and Trevor Ariza scored 23. ... Jeff Green, who has been dealing with left hip tightness, played 28:04 and scored four points. Pistons: Jackson had 16 points, six assists and seven turnovers. He went 4 of 4 from 3-point range. ... Detroit was 15 of 36 from beyond the arc. ... Kennard went 4 of 6 from 3. ... The Pistons won their first four games of the season, and they had a five-game winning streak from Nov. 23-Dec. 1.

HIGHLIGHT Maker met Portis at the rim and blocked his dunk attempt in the final seconds of the first quarter. Then he left the game to receive stitches to his upper lip. ""What a hustler that young man is,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I love the way he competes. His spirit is in the right place. He's about winning. He's not about himself. He's a good addition to our program, as far as what we're trying to build, with character. Basketball IQ is very, very important.""","401071513"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers signed Wesley Matthews to make a difference. They didn't necessarily expect it show up in his debut. Just two days after clearing waivers, the veteran guard scored eight points, had five rebounds and three assists and beat the shot-clock buzzer with the biggest basket of the game -- a 28-footer to help put away the Charlotte Hornets 99-90. The Pacers have won six straight -- all without two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo. ""We thought he (Matthews) was great,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""Part of the agreement was that he would start when he came and we were OK with that because we thought bringing that type of talent to this roster and having a guy like that going down the stretch and in the playoffs with that type of experience, we were going to need it."" It has been a whirlwind week for the veteran guard, who was traded Thursday from Dallas to New York and was subsequently released. After clearing waivers Saturday, the Pacers announced Sunday they had signed Matthews. By Monday night, he wasn't just wearing the blue-and-gold; he was starting. Initially, Matthews looked understandably out of sync. But as Matthews played on, he emerged as the difference-maker McMillan expected. While the stat line wasn't spectacular -- eight points, five rebounds and three assists -- his impact was huge. The long shot he made with 3:57 to play extended Indiana's lead to 92-82. And his second 3, with 2:15 left, gave Indiana a game-sealing 97-85 cushion. ""He'll take his shots, you see him, he struggled with his shot a little at the beginning but then he hits (two 3-pointers) toward the end that closes it out,"" Darren Collison said after finishing with 13 points and eight assists. ""That's what he brings to the table."" Three other Indiana players reached double figures, including Myles Turner, who had 18 points, eight rebounds and three blocks. Thaddeus Young added 11 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Charlotte was led by Kemba Walker, who scored 26 of his 34 points in the second half when the Hornets attempted to rally from a 16-point halftime deficit. Walker scored half of the Hornets' points during a 10-3 spurt to open the third quarter, made three consecutive free throws to get Charlotte within 64-57 and then made 3 with 1:02 left in the quarter to cut the deficit to 72-71. But Turner and Collison closed out the third with back-to-back baskets, Indiana scored the first eight points of the fourth and Matthews closed it out with his two big shots. ""Everybody's got to do their job,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""Tonight we didn't have all of our guys on board."" TIP-INS Hornets: Walker has scored at least 30 points in five consecutive games. He also had nine rebounds. ... Jeremy Lamb had 21 points and Cody Zeller added 18 points and nine rebounds while returning to his home state.  ... Tony Parker sat out with a sprained back. ... The Hornets were 7 of 40 on 3s, 25 of 33 on free throws and shot a season-low 32.2 percent. ... Charlotte lost the season series 2-1 and only has one series win since 2007-08. Pacers: The Pacers have won at least six straight three times this season, their highest single-season total since 2003-04. ... McMillan moved within three wins of tying Isiah Thomas for No. 6 on the Pacers' NBA franchise career victory list (131). ... Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 points. ... The Pacers were outrebounded 21-5 on the offensive end but were only outscored 16-8 in second-chance points. FAST START Indiana never trailed after taking a 12-11 lead in the first quarter. But the fast starts have become a staple since losing their first four games without Oladipo. They charged out to a 32-19 lead after one, their fifth straight game with at least 30 points in the first quarter, and extended the margin to 39-19 early in the second. ""It's encouraging when you get out to good starts like this, but it's really (all) defense,"" Turner said. ""I think we held them to 38 points in that first half."" THEY SAID IT Hornets: ""They're one of the best defensive teams, if not the best, in the league,"" Borrego said. Pacers: ""I'm happy to see them, happy to see them playing well now. I don't expect anything less than that,"" Oladipo said on a conference call Monday morning.","401071514"
"TORONTO --  Marc Gasol was a winner in his first home game with the Toronto Raptors  thanks to a sweet shot by Kawhi Leonard. Leonard banked home the tiebreaking basket with 4.2 seconds remaining and the Raptors edged the Brooklyn Nets 127-125 on Monday night. ""I asked if he called 'bank,'"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""He said he called 'game.'"" Leonard scored 30 points, Serge Ibaka had 18 points and 12 rebounds and Pascal Siakam scored 17 for the Raptors, who have won eight straight home meetings with the Nets. Gasol scored 16 points, 11 in the fourth quarter, in his home debut after being acquired from Memphis last Thursday. ""I definitely got more comfortable,"" Gasol said of his big quarter. D'Angelo Russell scored 28 points and had a career-high 14 assists for Brooklyn. Joe Harris scored 24 points and made a career-best seven 3-pointers, but the Nets lost for the fifth time in six games. The Nets gave the ball to Russell on their final possession, but his long shot bounced off the rim and into Kyle Lowry's hands. Lowry and Patrick McCaw each scored 13 for the Raptors, who have won 14 of 15 against Brooklyn. Allen Crabbe made six 3-pointers and scored 22 points, while Jarret Allen scored 15 for the Nets. Toronto led 120-114 on a 3 by Lowry at 2:45 of the fourth but Crabbe replied with back-to-back 3-pointers to tie it at 120 at 1:34. Russell hit a tiebreaking 3 with 50 seconds to go, but Danny Green answered with a 3 for the Raptors. With the teams tied at 92 to begin the fourth, Gasol scored 11 of Toronto's first 13 points in the final quarter. ""It was a heck of a stretch for him,"" Nurse said. ""Really fun, really impressive."" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson had praise for Gasol, too. ""I thought he commanded in the post,"" Atkinson said. ""I could really see him anchoring that second unit and making them very dangerous."" Gasol received a standing ovation when he replaced Ibaka at 3:03 of the first. ""It gives you the butterflies in your stomach,"" Gasol said of the rousing welcome. ""It made you feel like a rookie again. It's a great feeling to have."" Harris made five of six from 3-point range in the first quarter and Brooklyn led 29-21 after one. The five 3-pointers are the most Harris has made in a single quarter, and matched his season high for an entire game. The Nets led 60-56 at halftime. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn shot 20 for 41 from 3-point range, matching their season high for made 3-pointers. ... F DeMarre Carroll (left knee) was not available.

This was the first of six consecutive home games for the Raptors, who don't play on the road against until March 3 at Detroit. ... Musician Sting attended the game. CHANGING OF THE GUARDS Raptors guard Fred VanVleet was not available. Before the game, the Raptors said VanVleet will miss at least three weeks because of a ligament injury in his left thumb. VanVleet was hurt in the second quarter of Saturday's win at New York. Toronto acquired some insurance at the point guard position Monday when they agreed to sign veteran Jeremy Lin, who is being waived by the Atlanta Hawks. Lin will sign with Toronto later this week, said Jim Tanner, one of his agents. NOT CLICKING YET In his second game since missing 42 with a right foot injury, Caris LeVert shot 3 for 11 and scored six points. ""Is he clicking on all cylinders? No, but I don't care, quite honestly,"" Atkinson said.","401071515"
"CHICAGO --  The Greek Freak was back in action -- and the rest of the Milwaukee Bucks eventually got rolling to pull out a win. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 29 points and had 17 rebounds, Eric Bledsoe added 19 points and Milwaukee came on late to outlast the pesky Chicago Bulls 112-99 on Monday night. ""I liked our defensive focus for most of the fourth quarter, and offensively, I thought we were a little closer to ourselves in the second half,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Played with a little more pace, a little more purpose in the second half. I think it showed."" Antetokounmpo recorded his 39th double-double of the season in his return after sitting out his fourth game of the season Saturday, against Orlando in Milwaukee, due to right knee soreness The Bucks had their lowest scoring output of the season in that one as their six-game winning streak ended in a 103-83 loss to the Magic. Milwaukee built a 100-86 lead midway through the fourth quarter against Chicago, but the Bulls' 11-0 run late in the quarter cut the Bucks' advantage to three points with under 3 minutes left. The Bucks finished the game with a 12-2 spurt to seal the win. ""I think we just trust one another and were playing with a lot of effort,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Especially defensively, we tried to pick it up in the second half. We were just finding the open man offensively, and we were able to knock down some shots."" Malcolm Brogdon added 17 points and Khris Middleton had 16 to help league-leading Milwaukee win for the seventh time in eight games and improve to 13-2 over its last 15. The Bucks' ball control wasn't at its best as they committed 17 turnovers. ""They tried to get us with a little spoiler alert today, and we couldn't let it happen, said Bledsoe, who had 12 points in the fourth quarter, including two big 3-point baskets. Zach LaVine finished with 27 points after scoring 17 in the first half, and Lauri Markkanen had 20 points and 17 rebounds to help Chicago stay close until the end. Otto Porter Jr., acquired last week from Washington, added 18 points in his third game with the Bulls, but Chicago lost for the fourth time in five and dropped to 3-18 in its last 21. Coach Jim Boylen lauded his young team for staying close. ""I thought the first half we controlled the game a little bit,"" Boylen said. ""I thought the tempo was good. I thought our feel was good. . Got down, we battled back."" He praised the 21-year-old Markkanen, who helped try to cover Antetokounmpo. ""I thought Lauri matched force with force,"" Boylen said. ""I thought Lauri was aggressive."" Markkanen relished the matchup with one of the NBA's premier stars. ""I was trying to take the drive away,"" Markkanen said. ""I know (Antetokounmpo) prefers the right, so that's what I was trying to do. But obviously he can go both ways, so it's a difficult task."" Milwaukee led 22-21 after one quarter and a sluggish start for both teams, with Chicago making nine of 28 shots from the floor and the Bucks hitting just eight of 24. Antetokounmpo put the Bucks in front in the final seconds on a free throw to complete a 3-point play. Milwaukee tried to pick up the pace in the second quarter, but couldn't sustain it to pull away. The Bucks opened an eight-point lead midway through the quarter, but LaVine and Markkanen came on and helped Chicago trim Milwaukee's lead to 50-49 at the half. Milwaukee opened the second half with a 15-4 run for a 12-point lead, but Chicago replied with an 11-2 spurt to stay close. The Bucks led 79-71 after the three quarters.

"HOUSTON --  There was only a little over a minute left in Houston's game and it looked as if James Harden's streak of 30-point games would be ending. Harden brought the ball down the court and was enveloped by two defenders near the 3-point line, so he passed to Chris Paul, who drew the defense away. After a couple of dribbles Paul turned and got it back to Harden, who stepped back and sunk a 3-pointer over Dorian Finney-Smith to keep the streak alive. Harden scored 31 points for his 30th straight 30-point game despite dealing with a shoulder injury, leading the Rockets to a 120-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. Paul was asked if he was determined to help Harden extend the streak. ""For sure. He had what 28, so yeah, why not? We was up,"" Paul said. Harden, who had eight rebounds and seven assists, seemed to be a bit slowed early by the strained left shoulder that he injured on Saturday against Oklahoma City, making just one of his first seven shots. But he warmed up after that and finished 9 of 23, capped by his sixth 3-pointer with 52.9 seconds remaining. Fans chanted ""MVP! MVP!"" after he sunk the shot. Harden denied that he was concerned about getting 30 points, but he did say it was a ""credit to"" Paul that he got the ball back to him. ""I was worried about winning,"" Harden said. ""They were making their shots. They were coming back, cut the lead to I think 10 or nine points ... so I just wanted to get the proper shots ... I was just trying to make the right play."" He's now just one game from tying Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest streak of 30-point games in NBA history. Chamberlain also holds the top 30-point game streak with 65 in a row. Harden, who usually shies away from discussing any ailments, acknowledged that his shoulder was bothering him on Monday night and said he'd been receiving treatment around the clock since Saturday night. ""I couldn't get the lift that I usually have from my shot,"" he said. ""But that's no excuse. I'm just happy we won the game."" Coach Mike D'Antoni could see that Harden's shoulder was slowing him, and when he had just 20 points with less than three minutes left he thought Monday would be the end of the streak. ""I didn't think there was ... (a) way,"" D'Antoni said. ""But he was amazing."" Houston had a 14-point lead entering the fourth quarter and was up 106-90 when Harden entered the game for the first time in the period with about 6 1/2 minutes left. The Mavericks went on a 7-0 run after that, with a 3-pointer from Jalen Brunson, to get within 106-97 with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining. Harden heated up after that, making two 3-pointers in a 9-3 run to extend the lead to 115-100 with about 2 minutes left and put the game out of reach. ""We had a couple of good runs in the fourth and then they would come down and make a play,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Luka Doncic had 21 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for the Mavericks, who lost for the first time this season to Houston after winning the first two meetings. Paul added 17 points with 11 assists, and Gerald Green scored 19 points with five 3-pointers to help Houston to its fourth win in five games. The Rockets were up by 14 at halftime and Harden scored seven points in the first few minutes of the third quarter to help push the lead to 76-58. Harden later dished to Green for a 3-pointer to make it 85-66. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dwight Powell scored 12 points. ... Brunson had 13 points and five rebounds. ... Dallas made 13 of 36 3-pointers.

No one is even close to the 15,806 assists and 3,265 steals Stockton had in his 19-year career with the Utah Jazz. ""I don't like saying never but ain't nobody catching him.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Derrick Rose and Jeff Teague gave a beleaguered backcourt a needed boost and lifted the Minnesota Timberwolves to a victory. Rose scored 22 points and Teague added 19 points and 10 assists for the Timberwolves, who played without the ill Andrew Wiggins but beat the Los Angeles Clippers 130-120 on Monday night. Rose and Teague both have missed significant time with injuries recently. ""We're veterans,"" Rose said. ""I think we know how to gauge a game a little bit. Play us at the same time, and I think it will work out."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, while Dario Saric had 19 points. Lou Williams scored a season-high 45 points off the bench for the Clippers, making a season-best 16 free throws while going perfect from the line. ""It's hard to kind of digest that when you lose a game,"" Williams said. ""Grand scheme of things, career-wise, it's pretty cool."" Montrezl Harrell added 18 points off the bench for Los Angeles, part of an 89-point effort from the reserves. The Clippers came in leading the league in bench scoring at 51.6 points per game. Minnesota had lost its previous four games and six of its previous seven while struggling with injuries at the point guard position. On Monday night, the Timberwolves had both Rose and Teague on the court at the same time for the first time since Jan. 20 against the Phoenix Suns. ""Obviously we're not satisfied with one win, but it's hard to win in this league,"" Saunders said. Teague returned to the lineup Friday in New Orleans. He had missed the previous eight games with soreness in his left foot. Rose played Monday after missing six of the previous seven games with soreness in his right ankle. The Timberwolves had played nine games without having both Teague and Rose available. ""It felt good,"" Rose said. ""I was just trying to read the situation, take my time and be patient while I was out there."" Neither team led by more than eight points in the first half. The Timberwolves closed the half on a 10-2 run to take a 63-55 lead into the locker room. Rose scored 12 of his 22 points in the first half, including a difficult layup just before the halftime buzzer. Teague had nine of his 19 points in the first half. ""Two guys who can handle the ball and make plays,"" Teague said. ""He is a tremendous player. He can get to the rack at any time. Having another guy that's special with that basketball like that makes my job so much easier."" Minnesota then scored the first 10 points of the third quarter to open up a double-figure lead. The Timberwolves would go on to lead by as many as 23 points. They held on against a Clippers team that has rallied from 20 or more points down on the road three times this month. ""We were awful defensively,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""The game was 48 minutes of single mistakes. We made so many mistakes."" TEAM-FIRST TAJ Saunders moved Saric into the starting lineup Monday. His start came at the expense of veteran forward Taj Gibson, who willingly moved into a reserve role. Both Saunders and Saric were full of praise for Gibson, who scored 14 points off the bench while playing both power forward and center. ""Lucky for me, I've got a guy like Taj Gibson on my team,"" Saunders said. ""I can't say enough about him. I brought him the idea. It was actually yesterday. And he was all for it. It just shows his professionalism in the fact that he has 14 points off the bench playing both the 4 and the 5. You can't say enough about him.""

"ESPN Thunder reporter Royce Young describes the emotion Russell Westbrook felt in the locker room following his 10th consecutive triple-double. (0:55) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Chalk up another triple-double record for Russell Westbrook. Westbrook set an NBA record with his 10th straight triple-double, Paul George scored 47 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Portland Trail Blazers 120-111 on Monday night. Westbrook broke a tie with Wilt Chamberlain, who had nine straight triple-doubles in 1968, by finishing with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. Westbrook already was the only person to average a triple-double in consecutive seasons, and he set the single-season record for triple-doubles with 42 in 2016-17. He downplayed this record while still showing respect for Chamberlain. ""I just go play the game the right way,"" he said. ""It's what I do. Go out and compete every night and leave it on the floor, and whatever happens, happens. I'm very, very blessed to be able to go out and play, and I don't take it for granted."" Westbrook clinched the record on an assist to George for a 3-pointer with 3:52 remaining in the fourth quarter. ""I thought he had it already,"" George joked. ""Usually, Russ has that by the first quarter. I didn't know it was that close."" It was Westbrook's 23rd triple-double of the season and the 127th of his career. Most important to the Thunder, the team has a 9-1 record during his triple-double run. ""I do know the most important thing for him is to win,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""That's what he's about. He wants to win. I think a lot of the things he does that he gets attention for in terms of the triple-doubles are things that impact winning for our team."" George had 12 rebounds and 10 assists for the third triple-double of his career. Rookie Deonte Burton had a career-high 18 points and Raymond Felton added a season-high 15 for the Thunder. Damian Lillard scored 31 points and Jake Layman added 17 for Portland. The Thunder shot 56 percent in the first half to lead 68-49 at the break. George scored 21 points and Felton added 15. The Trail Blazers started the second half on a 7-0 run to make things interesting, and they trimmed Oklahoma City's lead to 87-82 by the end of the third quarter. Westbrook had five assists heading into the fourth, and after a rest, he re-entered the game with 9:36 remaining. He got his first assist of the quarter with 6:54 left and was up to his ninth with 4:57 to play. Westbrook made a 3-pointer in the final minute that gave George his triple-double. Westbrook told George that he was one assist away. ""Yeah, we talked about it right before that play,"" George said. ""I was clueless at that moment. But he told me the situation. So, it's cool to be on the other end of the triple-double."" Westbrook figured he might as well get a different kind of assist. ""It's amazing to go out and compete,"" he said, ""to see your teammate, your brother, do amazing things, and you can be right on the side of him doing something special as well."" TIP INS Trail Blazers: CJ McCollum was called for a technical in the second quarter. ... McCollum shot 4 for 15. ... Portland shot 33.3 percent in the first half.

"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets halted a three-game skid by turning up their defense and turning things over to their deep guard rotation which will only get deeper when Gary Harris and Isaiah Thomas return to action after the All-Star break. ""We were tired of losing, three in a row, and coach wasn't too happy about it,"" said Monte Morris, who scored 17 points in Denver's 103-87 win over the Miami Heat on Monday night. ""We just needed to get back to our old style, our old Nuggets basketball, flying around and covering for mistakes."" The Nuggets have found a way to keep all their guards happy. ""Nobody cares, I mean, it's a different guy every single night,"" Morris said. ""That's what you get when you have a deep team. We've still got guys that haven't even played yet that's coming back. So, if winning is as important as everyone preaches on our team, we shouldn't have a problem."" On a night when Jamal Murray (3 for 12) wasn't shooting well, two other guards stepped up. Not only did Morris score 17, but Malik Beasley chipped in 20. With Thomas and Harris coming back soon, fans wonder how coach Michael Malone will get enough playing time for all his guards over the final 25 games. Malone can't wait. ""It's going to be a great problem to have,"" Malone said. ""Our depth is something that we think we can wear teams down with and we've shown that we're more than willing and capable of playing small at times. So, you can throw a small lineup out there. So, we'll figure it out. But let's let them get healthy first and then we'll figure out what the best lineup is to win that game. ""After our first two possessions tonight, I wasn't sure if we had a point guard who could run the team. That was comical. But after that, we got settled and played pretty good basketball from that point on."" Murray was at the point when the Nuggets turned the ball over on their first two possessions, leading to fast breaks by the Heat, who would hang tough until the third quarter. Nikola Jokic had 23 points and 12 rebounds for Denver, which swept the season series from the Heat for the first time since 2008-09 and improved to 18-1 when holding opponents under 100 points. It marked the first time they did that since a 105-99 win at New Orleans on Jan. 30. And they had allowed an average of 127 points during their losing streak. The Nuggets struggled especially with 3-point defense in their losses at Detroit, Brooklyn and Philadelphia, yielding a combined 48 percent success rate from long range in their East Coast swing. And Miami was coming off a heartbreaking two-point loss at Golden State on Sunday in which they sank 18 3-pointers. ""I hope they got all their makes last night and left that in San Francisco,"" Malone cracked before tip-off. The Heat, who were led by Justise Winslow's 15 points, did indeed go cold from long range, finishing 9 of 23 for a 27-percent clip. The Nuggets regained their shooting touch, sinking 16 3-pointers including four in a 16-0 run they used to build a 75-57 lead. ""Our focus and intensity is in the right place, but our execution was a bit off for a bunch of reasons,"" Winslow said. ""But they outplayed us tonight. That's the bottom line. They're the better team."" FATIGUE FACTOR The Heat scored 38 second-half points and shot 36 percent from the field. ""I kept reminding our guys, `They played last night. Wear them down,"" Malone said. They did. ""They wanted to run and it got away,"" Dwyane Wade said. ""Losing last night was a tough loss. But this was the toughest one of the trip.""

"ATLANTA --  Trae Young knew he'd have to carry a heavy load, and that was OK with him. The rookie was pumped to face LeBron James. Young had 22 points and 14 assists, John Collins also scored 22 points despite foul trouble, and the Atlanta Hawks defeated James and the Los Angeles Lakers 117-113 on Tuesday night. The Hawks snapped a three-game losing streak despite a triple-double from James, who had 28 points, 16 assists and 11 rebounds. ""I try to live in big moments,"" Young said. ""I feel like I belong here. He's one of the best players of all time. But when I'm out on the court, I'm trying to compete and get a win."" Young matched his season high by playing 38 minutes, taking on a greater burden after the Hawks bought out the contract of his veteran backup, Jeremy Lin. With Jaylen Adams sidelined by a sprained right ankle, Young was the only true point guard on the roster. ""It was definitely different,"" Young said. Asked if he was tired, he said with a smile, ""A little bit."" Despite chants of ""Kobe's better"" from the sellout crowd of 16,824, James was cheered loudly by a hefty contingent of Lakers fans. He turned in a dazzling effort, equaling his season high by playing 43 minutes, but it wasn't enough to make up for the subpar group around him. The Lakers dropped 2 1/2 games behind Sacramento for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. ""We either make it or we don't make it,"" James said. ""Don't worry about it."" But the frustration was apparent on his face when he stormed straight to the locker room as soon as the horn sounded. ""Some guys have never played a playoff game before,"" James said. ""You can't teach them that. It's very important to understand how important every game is, no matter who you're playing or where you are."" Both teams struggled mightily in the final quarter after an up-and-down track meet over the first three periods. The Hawks made just 5 of 19 shots over the final 12 minutes; the Lakers weren't much better, hitting 6 of 22. The teams combined to go 3 of 18 from 3-point range. The Hawks scored just seven points in the final 6:33 but managed to hold on. Taurean Prince delivered a key 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining, and Young darted past James for a lay-in and a foul that thwarted any hope of a Lakers comeback. It sure didn't start out that way. Atlanta tied a franchise record for 3-pointers in a quarter, going 10 of 17 in the opening period for a 38-32 lead. The Lakers fought back to take a 69-65 edge at the half, but Atlanta pulled ahead for good to lead 100-95 going to the fourth. The Lakers had a chance after an Atlanta turnover led to a driving basket by James, cutting the Hawks' lead to 116-113. But after desperately trying to come up with a steal, Los Angeles was forced to foul Kevin Huerter with 4.3 seconds left. He made the second of two free throws to seal the victory. TIP-INS Lakers: James' triple-double was his fifth this season. ... Rajon Rondo was charged with six turnovers. ... Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram scored 19 points apiece. Hawks: After matching its record for 3s in a quarter, set Oct. 21 at Cleveland, Atlanta missed all six of its attempts beyond the arc the next period. ... Forty-two-year-old Vince Carter turned in some crucial minutes, contributing 11 points, five rebounds and three assists after sitting out Sunday's loss to Orlando. ... Collins picked up his fifth foul with 7:19 remaining but managed to make it to the end. INJURY REPORT The Lakers were without center Tyson Chandler, who was sidelined by a toe injury. Mike Muscala dressed despite a sprained right ankle, but didn't play against his former team. Adams is set to take over as Atlanta's backup point guard as soon as he is recovered from his ankle injury. In his absence, DeAndre' Bembry and Kent Bazemore shared the playmaking duties when Young wasn't on the court. ""Those guys did a good job of keeping up afloat,"" Carter said. STAYING PUT The Lakers stuck with the same starting five they used in Sunday's loss at Philadelphia. Newcomer Reggie Bullock, acquired last week from Detroit, took the court with James, Kuzma, Ingram and JaVale McGee. Coach Luke Walton said he wanted to give that group another look before deciding if further changes are needed.","401071521"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The Boston Celtics still own the Philadelphia 76ers no matter who is on the court. Gordon Hayward scored 26 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:50 remaining, and Boston beat Philadelphia 112-109 on Tuesday night. Al Horford had 23 and Jayson Tatum scored 20 and grabbed 10 rebounds to help the Celtics continued their dominance over the Sixers. Playing without All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, who sprained his right knee Saturday night, the Celtics beat the Sixers for the third straight meeting this season after defeating them in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. ""Against a very quality opponent was big, especially on the road without Kyrie, it was huge,"" Hayward said. Joel Embiid had 23 points and 14 rebounds and Jimmy Butler scored 22 for Philadelphia. Hayward's 3 from the corner put Boston up 105-103 and Marcus Smart added a free throw. The Sixers had a chance to tie when Jimmy Butler went to the line for three free throws but he missed two. After a turnover, Embiid lost the ball with under a minute left. Smart then blew past Ben Simmons for a dunk to extend the lead to 108-104 with 24 seconds left. Butler made a driving layup and a free throw to cut it to 108-107. After Horford sank two free throws, Tobias Harris missed a 3 and Embiid put it back in with only 2.4 seconds left. Butler couldn't get a desperation 3 off in time before the buzzer sounded as the Sixers dropped their first game in three since acquiring Harris in a flurry of moves last week. ""This is a new team,"" Simmons said. ""There are things we're going to work on, things we need to get better at, but it's a good test for us to see where we're at with this new team. But I'm excited with everyone we have and to see how far we can go."" The Celtics answered the call in their first game since Marcus Morris questioned the team's toughness after they surrendered leads of 28 points to the Clippers and 18 points to the Lakers on their home court. ""Good teams have clunkers, but good teams respond to those with the right effort and approach,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Both teams are tied for the fourth spot in the East with a 36-21 record. ""We understood Philly's been playing at a high level,"" Horford said. ""We had disappointing losses at home. I felt like our backs were against the wall, so we all needed to come out and set the tone and we did that."" After trailing for nearly the entire first half, the Sixers opened the third quarter on a 9-0 run to take a 55-52 lead. JJ Redick's 3-pointer capped the run. Minutes later, Simmons thrilled the crowd by driving around Tatum and throwing down a thunderous right-handed jam. But Tatum answered at the opposite end with a spin move around Embiid and dunk over Simmons. NO TAMPERING The NBA said Los Angeles Lakers president Magic Johnson did not break any league tampering rules when he spoke about possibly working with Simmons in the offseason. The investigation was initiated after it was revealed Sunday that Simmons wanted to meet with Johnson to talk about the art of being an elite point guard. Johnson complimented Simmons publicly on Sunday. Sixers GM Elton Brand said Monday he already told Simmons he wouldn't allow it. TIP-INS Celtics: Improved to 14-13 on the road. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  After a night of successful 3-point shooting for the San Antonio Spurs, LaMarcus Aldridge took over inside in the closing minutes. Aldridge scored 22 points, including San Antonio's final seven, as the Spurs broke a four-game slide with a 108-107 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. Aldridge's inside baskets to close the game were contrary to a Spurs offense that benefited from going 13 of 21 from outside the arc on the night, including 13 of 16 through the first three quarters. ""When (teammates) are knocking down shots like that, it gives me space to play one-on-one on the block, and I can get to my moves,"" Aldridge said. That is what happened down the stretch. Avery Bradley, who led Memphis, with a career-high 33 points, scored on a 16-footer with just under 4 minutes left for a 102-101 Memphis lead. Aldridge would then score on tip-in, an 8-footer followed by a short hook to put San Antonio ahead to stay. He split a pair of free throws with 51.1 seconds left to give San Antonio a 108-106 lead. Memphis rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. had a chance to tie the game with two free throws with a second left. He missed the first, and, in attempting to miss the second, banked it in, giving San Antonio the final possession to run out the clock. ""He helped us be in the position we were in,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of his 19-year-old forward. ""This is part of his growth. He's a rookie, and it's going to take him some time and some experience. But you have to go through these situations to get better."" Patty Mills also scored 22 for San Antonio while Davis Bertans added 17. Rudy Gay finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds. The victory was a relief for the Spurs. The annual Rodeo Road Trip had been particularly rough this year, as they lost the first four games by an average of almost 21 points. Part of the problems stem from starting guard Derrick White being out with right heel soreness. ""It is difficult to lose your point guard,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""As you go out on the road on a road trip and you have to reconstitute everything. You can't run things the same way, everybody doesn't know where to go. It makes it just a little bit tough."" Jonas Valancunius -- like Bradley -- a trade deadline acquisition, had 23 points and 10 rebounds in his first game with Memphis. He brought a spark in the first half and finally slowed Aldridge after the Spurs forward muscled inside against a slimmer Memphis defenders. ""He's a big help,"" Jackson said of Valanciunas. ""Great size. Great strength. He uses his body effectively."" TIP-INS Spurs: In its second-quarter rally, San Antonio connected on 14 of its first 20 shots in the frame. .Have given up 100 points in last 17 games. The last time they held an opponent under 100 was on Jan. 9 in a 96-86 loss to Memphis. .The 62 percent success from 3-point range marked the fifth time this season, San Antonio shot better than 61 percent from outside the arc.

"NEW ORLEANS -- Anthony Davis doesn't want to play for New Orleans anymore. In a blowout loss Tuesday night, he noticed his teammates might have felt the same way. ""We sucked,"" Davis said. ""Nobody was interested in playing, is what it looked like."" Davis scored just three points on 1-of-9 shooting and was thoroughly outplayed by Orlando center Nikola Vucevic as the Magic beat the listless Pelicans 118-88. ""Obviously I missed a lot of shots, a lot of easy shots -- layups and stuff that I normally make -- early in the game,"" Davis added. ""But they came out more desperate. They played like they were playing for something, and they showed it."" Davis played 24 minutes in his third game since his agent told New Orleans the six-time All-Star wanted to be traded to a championship-contending team and won't sign an extension with the Pelicans. It was also his third game since returning from an injured left index finger. In his first game back, he had 32 points in a win over Minnesota, but he has averaged 8.5 points over the two games since. Davis' scoring output Tuesday was the lowest of his career in any game where he played at least 21 minutes. The reeling Pelicans (25-33), who've lost six of seven, sit in 13th place in the West, six games behind Sacramento for that conference's final playoff spot with 24 games left. While the Magic (26-32) remain below .500, they've won four straight -- including three straight on the road by 16 or more -- to pull within a two games of the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot as the All-Star break approaches. Vucevic had 25 points and 17 rebounds, Evan Fournier scored 22 points, and Jonathan Isaac scored a career-high 20 points, including 16 in the first quarter, when Orlando raced to a 39-11 lead. Aaron Gordon added 20 points for the Magic, who led by as many as 31 points and kept the lead above 20 the rest of the way en route to their fourth straight victory. ""It was an impressive show of games by us, the last three games. We really took care of business and really executed the game plans that the coaches put in,"" Vucevic said. ""We talked about the stretch right before the (All-Star) break and how it is an important one, how we can win some games and put us back in a good spot going into the second part of the season. We did that so far."" The normally up-tempo Pelicans, who came in averaging almost 116 points per game, shot 38.3 percent (36 of 94) en route to their lowest single-game point total this season. E'Twaun Moore, who has struggled with injuries this season, scored 19 points in his first start since Jan. 22. Jrue Holiday had 16 for the Pelicans, who briefly got as close as 14 in the middle of the second quarter but trailed by 63-46 at the half. ""It's definitely embarrassing,"" Holiday said of the 30-point loss. ""You don't want to do that anywhere but especially at home."" TIP-INS Magic: Outrebounded New Orleans 58-42. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State wasn't as crisp offensively as it usually is, and the two-time defending NBA champs certainly know they'll need to get better coming out of the All-Star break. Some heady defense early and late, along with some timely perimeter scoring from Stephen Curry helped make up for it. Curry made a pair of pivotal 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, Kevin Durant had 28 points and seven assists, and the Warriors beat the Jazz 115-108 on Tuesday night. ""We have spurts where we look unstoppable and then we have some spurts where it just gets a little congested and bogs down a little bit,"" Curry said. ""We're getting better. Everybody's attention is on those details to try to get better. We have 26 games left to figure it out."" At 41-15, the Warriors have the second-best record in the NBA behind Milwaukee. The Warriors have won five straight and 16 of 17 but have been slowing down heading into the break. The win over Utah was the third straight in which coach Steve Kerr's team has had to rally from behind. ""They were rolling offensively,"" Kerr said of the Jazz. ""We turned up the volume defensively down the stretch. Steph got hot and we were able to push (ahead)."" Curry had 24 points on 8 of 19 shooting. The two-time MVP missed his first five shots beyond the arc and finished 5 of 14 on 3s. Klay Thompson scored 22 and DeMarcus Cousins added 12 points and 10 rebounds for Golden State. ""We need to play better,"" Durant said. ""I believe my coaches and teammates think the same thing. I just don't want to get complacement."" Donovan Mitchell had 25 points and seven rebounds for Utah. Rudy Gobert added 13 points and 16 rebounds. Gobert's double-double is his 46th of the season. ""They made some tough shots and then I thought we just wore down a little bit and had some breakdowns defensively late where they were able to get clean looks,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""They're too good to give them good looks, and they got some."" The Warriors came back from 17 down to beat Phoenix on Friday and were down 19 to Miami on Sunday before winning. Both of those deficits were at halftime. This time Golden State fell behind 91-84 early in the fourth before going on a 21-4 run. Andre Iguodala helped spark the surge with a steal and dunk while Thompson had a 3-pointer and reverse layup, but it was Curry's burst that was key. Curry made back-to-back 3s then drove around Ricky Rubio for an easy layup that put the Warriors up 105-95. ""We turned up the volume defensively down the stretch, Steph got hot and we were able to push (ahead),"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. Before the game Curry, Durant and Thompson received their All-Star jerseys from general manager Bob Myers. The Warriors got off to a rough start with their perimeter shooting, going 1 of 9 beyond the arc in the first quarter, and didn't find their stroke until late in the second. Curry made back-to-back 3s, Iguodala added one and Thompson -- who appeared to dislocate the ring finger on his left hand in the first quarter -- made another. Golden State led 62-53 early in the third before Mitchell got Utah rolling with a pair of 3s and seven points as part of an 18-7 run. Neto later made consecutive layups to put the Jazz up 84-81. TIP-INS Jazz: Rubio missed an open layup and shot an airball on a 3-point try in the first quarter. ... Utah committed 16 turnovers that led to 27 points for Golden State. .

Thompson made three 3s to move past Dale Ellis into 17th place on the NBA's list for career 3-pointers with 1,721. DRAYMOND'S DEFENSE Green made one of the biggest defensive plays of the game when he blocked a 3-point try by Jae Crowder early in the fourth quarter. It came in the midst of an 11-2 run by the Warriors and not long after Green deflected an alley-oop pass to Gobert. ""Just what he always does,"" Kerr said. ""Guards everybody on the floor, gets out to shooters, protects the rim. You have to have somebody like Draymond to anchor your defense.""","401071525"
"CLEVELAND --  DeMarre Carroll saved the day for the Brooklyn Nets, and D'Angelo Russell took advantage of the extra opportunity. Russell scored 14 of his 36 points in the third overtime after Carroll's desperation 3-pointer in the second OT tied the game, and the Nets outlasted the Cleveland Cavaliers 148-139 on Wednesday night. Russell's big finish wouldn't have been possible if Carroll hadn't shocked everyone with his buzzer-beating shot. The fact the play wasn't even designed for Carroll made the result even more improbable. ""It was for Joe (Harris) or Allen (Crabbe),"" he said. ""It was a broken play. I saw an opening and I took it."" Cleveland seemed to have sealed the win when Jordan Clarkson, who scored a career-high 42 points, made a go-ahead jumper in the final minute to put the Cavaliers ahead and added two free throws for a 128-125 lead. Brooklyn called timeout and Carroll was double-teamed in the corner after taking the inbounds pass. He took a couple of dribbles to his left and put up the shot. Carroll fell to the floor and was mobbed by his teammates, who stormed off the bench. Russell, who is headed to play in his first All-Star game, had two points in the first half and scored Brooklyn's first 11 points in third overtime, including two 3-pointers. Russell's teammates pulled him aside at halftime with a clear message. ""They kept pushing me,"" he said. ""They weren't letting me get down. I made sure I got the ball."" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said: ""He was really strong in the second half and all the overtimes, but that's the sign of an All-Star."" Harris scored 25 points and Carroll had 18 as the Nets improved to 30-29 -- above .500 at the All-Star break for the first time since 2012-13. The teams were playing their final game before the break, likely a good thing after going 63 minutes in a contest that saw 23 lead changes. Clarkson, playing a career-high 47 minutes, was 16 of 34 from the field and made 7 of 17 3-point attempts. ""We tried to leave everything on the floor trying to get a win knowing we've got these days off,"" he said. ""We didn't expect to go to three overtimes. But I'm in shape. I'll go all day."" Collin Sexton had 24 points and Marquese Chriss added 23 for Cleveland. Russell made two free throws with 16 seconds remaining to break a 116-all tie in the first overtime, but Sexton drove the lane and scored to tie the game with 2.8 seconds left. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love sat out to get additional rest following foot surgery. Brooklyn dressed nine players because of several injuries. Chriss, Larry Nance Jr, David Nwaba and Ante Zizic fouled out for Cleveland, which played its first overtime game of the season. The Cavaliers (12-46) were trying to win consecutive games for the third time this season. Cleveland has the third-worst record in the league. TIP-INS Nets: G Spencer Dinwiddle (torn ligaments in right thumb) F Treveon Graham (personal reasons), F Rodions Kurucs (sprained left elbow), F Jared Dudley (strained left hamstring) and G Dzanan Musa (G-League assignment) are out. Cavaliers: F Cedi Osman and C Ante Zizic returned to the starting lineup. Osman (sprained right ankle) missed four games and Zizic (sore lower back) didn't play Monday. ... F Tristan Thompson (sore left foot) is expected to return sometime after the break. He has missed the last 13 games. LOOKING AHEAD Love plans to increase his playing time following the All-Star break. The Cavaliers resume play against Phoenix on Feb. 21. ""I don't know minutes-wise what it's going to be like, but a good progression after that because I will be fully prepared to go,"" Love said. ""He's in a really good place right now both physically and mentally,"" Cavaliers coach Larry Drew said. STREAK SNAPPER The Nets, who had lost two straight and five of six, are sixth in the Eastern Conference. ""That was one of those weird games before the break,"" Atkinson said. ""It would have been tough with a loss, but this really keeps our morale up.""","401071526"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Giannis Antetokounmpo delivered the finishing touch Wednesday. The Milwaukee Bucks needed everything he could muster. Antetokounmpo rallied the Bucks from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit, recorded his fifth triple-double of the season and led Milwaukee past Indiana 106-97. He finished with 33 points, 19 rebounds and 11 assists to keep the Bucks atop the Eastern Conference heading into the All-Star break. ""There are only so many things you can do,"" said Pacers forward Thaddeus Young, who spent most of the night trying to defend Antetokounmpo. ""But when he's trying to post you up in the middle and is just spinning, he's already at the rim. It's just a tough battle. He did what he's supposed to do."" Time after time. Antetokounmpo opened the game by making five of the Bucks' nine first-quarter baskets, assisting on the other four. And after Milwaukee fell into an 86-76 hole early in the fourth, he bailed them out by scoring 12 points on 4-of-6 shooting with six rebounds and three assists over the final 11 1/2 minutes. Every moment the Bucks needed a big play, Antetokounmpo made it. His driving layup out of a timeout with 9:17 to go ended Indiana's 7-0 run. His dunk with 5:06 remaining gave Milwaukee a 93-92 lead. His 10-foot turnaround jumper at the 3:51 mark tied it at 95, and his nifty pass to a wide open Ersan Ilyasova for a tiebreaking layup with 2:36 left gave Milwaukee the lead for good. It was that kind of night. Antetokounmpo closed out the first half with a flourish -- his 13th game with at least 25 points, 15 rebounds and five assists to break a tie with Shaquille O'Neal for the most in a single-season since 1976-77. Malcolm Brogdon scored 17 points and Khris Middleton added 15. ""The team did a great job keeping its composure,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We changed the lineup, played harder and switched everything. We were able to make Indiana go 1-on-1, and I think we did a better job rebounding the ball and running the floor."" For a while, it looked as if the Pacers had a pretty solid handle on the three-time All-Star. Antetokounmpo followed his 5-of-7 start by missing six of his next seven shots as the Pacers charged back from 26-18 first-quarter deficit and a 55-47 halftime deficit to take the lead midway through the third quarter. They extended the margin to 10 on Tyreke Evans' 3-pointer with 9:37 left. But then the Bucks' best player steadied himself and his teammates, helping Milwaukee outscore the Pacers 30-11 the rest of the way. Bojan Bogdanovic led the Pacers with 20 points as Indiana's six-game winning streak ended. ""He's a monster,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""Nineteen rebounds? He is starting their break rebounding the ball and they were able to score 23 fast-break points off our misses and turnovers."" TIP-INS Bucks: Have won 20 road games, one more than they did all of last season. ... Milwaukee improved to 11-1 against Central Division foes this season by ending a four-game losing streak at Indianapolis. ... Middleton had six rebounds and five assists. ... George Hill scored 12 points in his home state while Ilyasova finished with 11. ... Recently acquired Nikola Mirotic sat out with a strained right calf. Pacers: Bogdanovic has 20 games with 20 or more points this season, a career high. ... Darren Collison and Domantas Sabonis each scored 14 points. Collison also had seven assists and six rebounds. ... Myles Turner had 11 points, six rebounds and two blocks. ... The Pacers scored 18 points in the first and fourth quarters and fell to 4-10 when scoring fewer than 100 points. TAKING A BREAK Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer is putting a planned trip to Costa Rica on hold so he can coach the Eastern Conference this weekend. But Budenholzer and McMillan both encouraged their players to spend some time doing things other than basketball over the next week. ""It would be nice to do a littler cardio, a little something to stay in shape. If that involves some basketball that's fine,"" Budenholzer said. ""Certainly, though, a break is probably needed by everybody."" THEY SAID IT Bucks: ""It's a good way to go into the break, beating a good team on the road,"" Budenholzer said. Pacers: ""We got away from what got us there,"" Turner said. ""The ball movement stopped and we just fell apart.""","401071527"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics haven't played as well as they've expected at times this season. They're hoping the games they've put together over the last six weeks are a sign of better things to come after the All-Star break. Jayson Tatum scored 19 points and Gordon Hayward finished with 18 to help the Celtics hold off the Detroit Pistons 118-110 on Wednesday night. Hayward added eight assists and five rebounds in his first start since Dec. 21. Al Horford finished with 17 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists. Jaylen Brown had 17 points and seven rebounds. The Celtics have won seven out of their last nine. The loss ended the Pistons' four-game win streak. Coach Brad Stevens said he liked the way his team gutted things out coming off a close win over the 76ers on Tuesday. ""This was a good two days for this group,"" Stevens said. ""I thought it showed a lot of good character and hopefully we can enjoy the rest."" After trailing by 11 in the first half, Boston outscored Detroit 34-20 in the third quarter and led by as many as 28 in the fourth. Celtics All-Star Kyrie Irving sat for the second straight game with a strained right knee, and Terry Rozier was also sidelined with an illness. Stevens adjusted to their absences by starting Smart and Tatum in the backcourt and rounded out his lineup with Hayward, Horford and Marcus Morris. It was another strong showing for Hayward, who now has scored 15 or more points in four of his last five games. He had only 10 such games in his first 48 games this season. Over his last five outings Hayward has averaged 17 points on 61 percent shooting (9 of 18 on 3-pointers), 5.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists. ""It was good the way we ended going into the break,"" Hayward said. ""It definitely builds some momentum."" Blake Griffin led Detroit with 32 points and eight rebounds. Andre Drummond added 21 points and 17 rebounds. Despite the loss, Drummond said he is also encouraged. ""This past week, week and a half, I think we played really, really good basketball,"" he said. ""We set a goal to go 5-2 and we succeeded with that. ... Got a week off, take a break, come back and it's off to the races from there."" TIP-INS Pistons: Were just 5 of 19 from the field (26 percent) and 2 for 9 (22 percent) from 3-point range in third quarter. Celtics: Improved to 9-2 this season without Irving. .  Rookie Robert Williams (illness) also sat along with Aron Baynes (left foot contusion). . Smart's 3-pointer early in the third quarter ended his 0-for-20 slump from beyond the arc. `GREAT ACTOR' Horford and Griffin made contact going for a loose ball near the sideline late in the fourth quarter. Following a video review by officials, Horford was called for a flagrant foul. Asked about the play after the game, Horford rolled his eyes and smiled. ""Blake is a great actor,"" Horford said. ""I was going for the ball, and he sold it well. So, yeah, I don't think that was a flagrant foul."" RUN TIME The Celtics were energized early, jumping out to an 8-0 lead. But Detroit negated it, responding with a 24-5 run to nudge back in front as Boston relied heavily on jump shots and went through a nearly five-minute scoring drought. The Celtics settled down, ending the opening period on a 15-5 run. Boston controlled the pace in the second quarter and led 57-52 at the half. IRVING UPDATE Stevens said Irving's status is officially ""day-to-day,"" but that he could theoretically be cleared to play if the Celtics had a game scheduled for Friday or Saturday. As far as Irving's availability for the All-Star Game, Stevens said he should only suit up if his knee is completely healthy. ""If there's any issues at all and he's not 110 percent, I would not play,"" Stevens said.","401071528"
"NEW YORK --  With a big lead and bigger games ahead, Joel Embiid could have opted for safety. He could have simply let the ball go out of bounds, without putting a scare into people in the 76ers' front office or along the Madison Square Garden sideline. That's not his style. ""I only know one way to play and that's to play hard and compete,"" Embiid said. The All-Star center had 26 points, 14 rebounds and one flying leap over an award-winning actress into the crowd, and Philadelphia handed the Knicks their 18th straight loss with a 126-111 victory on Wednesday night. Tobias Harris scored 25 points and Ben Simmons had 18 for the 76ers, who bounced back from their 112-109 home loss to Boston on Tuesday, sending themselves into the All-Star break with a 37-21 record. They went 7-5 during a difficult stretch of their schedule that included the trade with the Clippers to acquire Harris. ""We're in a good position,"" Simmons said. They had times Wednesday where it appeared they'd win easily, and other moments where the game became much more difficult than necessary against the team with the NBA's worst record. Allonzo Trier scored 19 points and fellow rookie Mitchell Robinson had 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks (10-46), who remain mired in the longest losing streak during one season in franchise history. ""All we can do is keep building on the good things we're doing and try to fix the things that are mistakes for us,"" Trier said. The 76ers made 14 of 18 shots (78 percent) in the first quarter, yet only led 37-33 after the Knicks outworked them on the offensive boards to get up nine more shot attempts. Philadelphia then pushed the lead to 71-55 at halftime. Philadelphia seemed headed for a rout when it scored eight straight points in the third to open an 88-62 advantage after a free throw by Simmons, but the Knicks put up 36 points in the period and were within single digits going to the fourth. It was during the third that Embiid gave the 76ers and plenty of people sitting courtside a scare when he tried to chase down a ball going to the sideline. He went flying just over the head of actress Regina King , who won the Best Supporting Actress award at the Golden Globes, and crashed feet-first into the MSG Network statistician working next to broadcaster Mike Breen. ""It's good that I saved her life I guess, but someone else had to, like, take that,"" Embiid said. ""I'm sorry about that."" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown's thoughts on Embiid's dive? ""Just like I think our owners and our fans back home were thinking,"" he said. ""You respect his aggression, and his passion, but you don't want that. I say that out of love and care. It's stuff you hope to avoid."" The statistician somehow stayed in the game. ""I didn't see him but I know he's going to feel it tomorrow,"" Simmons said. The Knicks had their moments, highlighted by rookie Kevin Knox's powerful slam over Simmons . But they don't have the firepower to beat a team like the 76ers, or anyone else in the league over the last 2  1/2 months. TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia has won the last eight meetings. ... Jimmy Butler had 13 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. ... Embiid had his 10th straight double-double. Knicks: Dennis Smith Jr. had 13 points and DeAndre Jordan, who came with him from Dallas in the Kristaps Porzingis trade, scored 12. KANTER'S CHANCE Coach David Fizdale said he was happy for Enes Kanter, who announced Wednesday he was signing with the Portland Trail Blazers. The Knicks waived their former starting center last Thursday after they weren't able to find a trade for him. ""Seriously, that's a great deal for him,"" Fizdale said. ""He landed with a playoff team."" PAY UP Embiid was fined $25,000 for his public criticism of the officiating, which included profanity, following Tuesday's loss. ""I knew what I was getting into,"" Embiid said. ""I haven't seen the Last 2-Minute Report but I did get fouled and everybody knew that. I felt like it changed the outcome of the game. The game could have been tied and I was in the heat of the moment."" The report did say Al Horford should have been called for fouling Embiid with 35 seconds remaining.","401071529"
"TORONTO --  Pascal Siakam isn't pleased to be taking it easy over All-Star weekend and took out his frustration Wednesday night. Siakam scored a career-high 44 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, OG Anunoby scored a career-best 22 points, and the Toronto Raptors beat the Washington Wizards 129-120 for their sixth straight win. ""If he keeps playing like this, he's a 2020 All-Star,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Siakam. Toronto's third-year forward was asked whether his big night was a message to those who passed him over for an All-Star spot this year. ""Take it as you want,"" Siakam said. ""I wish I was going to Charlotte."" Newly signed Raptors guard Jeremy Lin said he was impressed with Siakam's diverse skill set. ""I knew he was good but tonight was something special,"" Lin said. ""He showed the full package tonight."" Toronto improved to 13-3 without All-Star Kawhi Leonard, who sat for the second time in four games because of a sore left knee. Leonard also missed last Thursday's win at Atlanta. Coach Nick Nurse said he wouldn't mind if Leonard played in Sunday's All-Star Game. Serge Ibaka had 10 points and 13 rebounds, and Kyle Lowry had 14 points and 13 assists as the Raptors used a big third quarter to overcome a 12-point deficit and post their fifth straight victory over the struggling Wizards. Bradley Beal has 28 points and 11 assists, Jeff Green scored 23 and Jabari Parker 22 as Washington lost for the fifth time in seven games. ""We're down right now,"" Brooks said. ""We've got a lot of work ahead of us."" Down 103-93 to begin the fourth, Washington cut it to 112-111 on a 3-pointer by Bobby Portis with 4:55 left. Lowry replied with a 3 for Toronto, and Siakam made back-to-back baskets, putting Toronto up 119-111 at 3:44. Toronto faced its biggest deficit, 80-68, at 8:48 of the third. The Raptors answered with a 15-0 spurt, reclaiming the lead at 83-80 before Washington called timeout at 4:43. Siakam scored 19 points in the third, and Toronto closed the quarter on a 35-13 run, taking a 103-93 lead into the final quarter. Washington led 65-59 lead at halftime. LINSANITY IN THE NORTH Lin played 25 minutes in his Toronto debut after signing earlier in the day. He was recently waived by the Atlanta Hawks. ""I almost feel like I'm cheating, jumping into a 40-something win team,"" Lin said. ""I'm happy to be here."" Lin received a brief ovation when he checked in for Norman Powell at 4:05 of the first. He finished with eight points, five assists and five rebounds. ""Even though I was trying to be stoic and figure out what we were going to do on the defensive end, it was very heartwarming,"" Lin said. ""Every time I've come to Toronto, it's always felt like a home game."" Lin can expect plenty of action when play resumes after the All-Star break. Before the game, the Raptors said guard Fred VanVleet had surgery in New York to repair ligament damage in his left thumb. VanVleet, who was hurt in Saturday's win at New York, is expected to miss at least three weeks. TIP-INS Wizards: G Tomas Satoransky was inactive because of personal reasons. ... The Wizards missed nine of their first 10 attempts from 3-point range. ... Washington is 7-23 on the road. Raptors: F Patrick McCaw was inactive because of a sore right shoulder. ... Ibaka has scored at least 10 points in 20 straight games, the second-longest streak of his career. He did it in 21 games in 2014. ... Siakam made a career-best four 3-pointers, and Anunoby also had a season-high four. THIS IS 40 Siakam is the 11th player in Raptors history to reach the 40-point plateau.","401071530"
"CHICAGO --  Otto Porter Jr. is no longer taking a back seat when it comes to scoring. Porter scored a career-high 37 points on 16-for-20 shooting, Robin Lopez added season-high 25 points, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-110 on Wednesday night. Lauri Markkanen added 21 points as Chicago ended a franchise-record 11-game home losing streak with their first win at the United Center since beating Orlando on Dec. 21. Porter scored at ease, getting the Bulls' first six points in the third quarter and capping it off with a dunk off a pass from Zach LaVine. Porter later set up LaVine for a three-point play to give the Bulls a 80-66 lead with 7:21 left in the quarter. Porter was acquired a day before the deadline in a trade with Washington, where Joh Wall and Bradley Beal were the primary options. Porter is adjusting just fine to his new scoring role in the Chicago offense. ""It's totally different. I mean I'm just getting here, so I'm still figuring it out,"" Porter said. He was 3 for 5 from 3-point range in his third career 30-point game. ""Obviously, Otto had a big night. He let it come to him, he took good shots, had a nice rhythm, got the ball in his hands. His versatility, I thought, really showed,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said. Bradley got Memphis to 109-101 with 4:48 left, but the Bulls answered with a 10-0 run. Markkanen made a 3 to give the Bulls a 118-101 lead with 2:33 left. The Bulls also won for just the fourth time in 22 games. Avery Bradley scored 15 points for the Grizzlies, who lost for the second straight night. ""I think we were tired. There was no about it. We had a bunch of guys put forth a ton of effort in a game that went down to the wire. Guys were competitive and the energy level was high, the spirit was high. Tonight, we just couldn't find a spark,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Mike Conley was back in the Grizzlies' lineup after missing Tuesday's 108-107 loss to the Spurs with an illness. He finished with 12 points. Porter shot 8 for 9 from the field and 3 for 3 from 3-point range for 21 points in the first half. ""He (Porter) played very well, but not only him, but Lopez as well, Robin. He had a really good game. I thought he was the difference maker. He set the tone for the game for their team,"" Bradley said. The Bulls led 67-62 at the half. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jonas Valciunas each had 10 points for the Grizzlies and they each finished with 12 points. TIME FOR SOME REST The break couldn't come at a better time for Bradley, who was traded from the Clippers at the deadline to Memphis. ""I'm going to enjoy it. Go see my family now. It's been a crazy few days so it is going to be nice to get home with my wife and my kids,"" he said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: C Joakim Noah, who received a nice ovation when he checked in the first quarter, played against his former team for only the third time. Noah was the 2013-14 Defensive Player of Year with the Bulls. ""My years in Chicago were just so special and I feel I learned so much. In that 10-year span we were really going for it, we were going for a championship, and I thought there was a couple of years where we really had a chance,"" Noah said.

"DALLAS --  Dwyane Wade finished his pregame warmups by re-enacting his launch of the basketball toward the rafters from the moment he won his first championship with Miami on the home floor of the Dallas Mavericks nearly 13 years ago. The Heat star closed his night on the bench, with a win secure and many of his fans wearing or holding No. 3 jerseys standing and chanting, ""We want Wade,"" in the closing minutes. Wade had done enough already in what was almost certainly his last game in Dallas, scoring 22 points in one his better games of the season to help the Heat to a 112-101 victory over the Mavericks on Wednesday night. The 37-year-old who has already said this is his final season was a little better despite a gallant effort from Dirk Nowitzki, his two-time NBA Finals foe whose record 21st season with the same franchise has the feel of an unofficial farewell tour. The 40-year-old German finished two points shy of his season high with 12, although most of the highlights in their first meeting of the season came in the first half before the Heat outscored the Mavericks 32-16 in the third quarter and led by as many as 21 points in the fourth. ""Talking to Dirk at the end, he was just like, `Man, you look good,"" said Wade, relating their conversation while surrounded by cameras during a jersey swap at midcourt after the game. ""I said, `You have those days, right?' But those are the scary days, those days that you can mess around and be like, `Well, I can keep playing.' And then it'll be a day that you're like, `No, there's a reason why I'm retiring."" Nowitzki and Wade, both added to this weekend's All-Star game to recognize their decorated careers, entered the final game before the break together midway through the first quarter , which eased the boos on a Wade farewell tour that has been well-received everywhere else. There were some boos as they took the court, but those were quickly drowned out when many in the crowd stood and cheered two players mostly relegated to supporting roles on mediocre teams after so many years of leading championship-chasing franchises. ""There was a lot of obviously Wade fans in the building, well-deserved,"" Nowitzki said. The true reaction of Dallas fans to Wade came later when they booed the 13-time All-Star whenever he touched the ball. The Mavericks have always thought Wade was the beneficiary of questionable calls in the 2006 NBA Finals, which the Heat clinched with a Game 6 win in Dallas. Fans probably still remember the video of Wade and LeBron James faking coughs while leaving the Mavericks' arena after losing Game 4 of the 2011 Finals when Nowitzki, who was sick before the game, hit the winning shot. Dallas took Game 6 in Miami to win the series. For those who forgot, there were plenty of Twitter posts before the game noting the irony of Wade missing Miami's shootaround because of an illness in what should be his final Dallas appearance. Wade, who went on to win two more titles with James, was healthy enough to play, and had some vintage moments in the first half. He hit a 3 over Nowitzki before the smooth-shooting 7-footer answered with his familiar one-legged fadeaway over Wade at the other end. ""There's a great karma to each one of them,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""As soon as Wade got his opportunity to go one-on-one against him in the corner, you just knew that somehow Dirk was going to get him with an opportunity on the other end."" Some of the loudest boos for Wade came with him dribbling out the final seconds of the first half isolated on Dallas rookie Jalen Brunson. Wade swished a jumper over the two-time NCAA champion from Villanova to finish the half with a team-high 14 points. The Heat took control without Wade in the third quarter, with Josh Richardson scoring six of the first eight points on a 12-0 run that extended a one-point lead and put Miami ahead by double digits for good. Richardson scored 14 points, and Dion Waiters had 20. Justise Winslow had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Dallas rookie sensation Luka Doncic had 18 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. The only teenager in NBA history with multiple triple-doubles just missed his fourth. Tim Hardaway Jr. led the Mavericks with 20 points. ABOUT THAT RE-ENACTMENT Wade and Nowitzki ended up next to each other at the scorer's table waiting to enter the game for the first time. They shared a laugh. Turns out Nowitzki was giving Wade a hard time about recreating his 2006 ball toss. ""We just had a little laugh about it,"" Wade said. ""It's moments when you go through this, for me this is the last dance and there are certain games, there's certain ones that are a little bit more special."" Nowitzki smiled when asked about the exchange after the game. ""I was like, `That's bringing some bad memories back.' He had to laugh. He's like, `Yeah, I had to do it man. This is the building where everything started for me."" TIP-INS Heat: Finished with seven players in double figures. The others were James Johnson with 12 points and Kelly Olynyk and Bam Adebayo with 10 apiece. ... Richardson and Winslow had six assists each. Mavericks: C Salah Mejri returned after missing three games and made his second start of the season. The 7-foot-2 Tunisian was re-signed after getting waived as part of the trade that sent Harrison Barnes to Sacramento. Brunson started the second half instead of Mejri, who had two points and one rebound in eight minutes.","401071532"
"DENVER --  Ejected in the first half, Nuggets coach Michael Malone didn't get to an in-person look at Isaiah Thomas' first 3-pointer in a Denver uniform. He also didn't watch from his usual vantage point as Nikola Jokic tipped in the winner. The raucous reverberations from inside the arena told him everything. Jokic knocked in a basket with less than a second remaining, Thomas hit two big 3-pointers in his long-awaited Denver debut and the Nuggets held off the Sacramento Kings 120-118 on Wednesday night. ""This was one of the few home games that's gone down to the wire, which is good for us,"" said Malone, who watched from the locker room after receiving two technicals just before halftime. ""We need to continue to be challenged and be forced to execute and get stops."" Jokic finished with 20 points, 18 rebounds and 11 assists for his 28th career triple-double, and Paul Millsap matched a season high with 25 points to help Denver overcome a 17-point first-half deficit. Down six late, the Kings tied it on Buddy Hield's layup with 15.1 seconds. In a timeout, it became next-coach-up time in the Denver huddle. Wes Unseld. Jr., filling in for Malone, helped design a play to get Jokic open. Jokic went to work down low, missing his first shot attempt before tipping it in. Hield's last-gasp 3-pointer was off the mark at the buzzer. ""Coach Wes, everybody, all stepped up,"" said Jamal Murray, whose team is a league-best 25-4 at home this season. Hield wouldn't mind another crack at that shot. ""I was trying to find the rim but I didn't get my eye on the rim,"" said Hield, who led six Sacramento players in double figures with 25 points. ""On to the next. Enjoy the weekend we have coming up."" The Nuggets head into the All-Star break with a 39-18 record and on the heels of Golden State for the top spot in the Western Conference. Denver's trying to make the postseason for the first time since 2012-13. Thomas proclaimed his surgically repaired hip good to go prior to the game and was anxious to step back onto the court. He received a standing ovation when he entered the game late in the first quarter. The 30-year-old Thomas showed flashes of his talent in shaking off some rust. He played 13 minutes and scored eight points -- all in the third quarter -- in his first NBA game since March 22 when he was with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Nuggets signed the two-time All-Star to a one-year deal in the offseason and gave him plenty of space to recover from his hip operation. Thomas scored his first basket of the season on a 3-pointer with 2:16 left in the third quarter. Moments later, he drained another 3-pointer that gave Denver its first lead since early in the game. ""When my name is called, I'm going to always be ready,"" Thomas said. ""When I'm in the game, I'm going to make it hard for the coach to take me out."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento scored 41 points in the first quarter. ... F Harrison Barnes had 19 points and 11 rebounds. ... De'Aaron Fox had 15 points and 10 assists. Nuggets: G Gary Harris sat out a seventh straight game with a strained adductor. ... G Malik Beasley was ejected in the fourth quarter after picking up a second technical. He had 21 points. WELCOME, FLACCO Asked to talk about Thomas, Malone quipped: ""I was hoping we could talk about Joe Flacco."" The veteran QB was acquired by the Denver Broncos on Wednesday in a trade with Baltimore that will become official next month when the league's new year begins, a person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press. ""I want to welcome him to Nuggets country,"" Malone cracked. KINGS AT THE BREAK At 30-27, Sacramento is very much in the playoff picture and quickly developing chemistry after acquiring Barnes and Alec Burks in deadline deals. ""We're competing. We like each other. They get along great,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""It's a time to take a breath, get your feet up a little bit, get some mental rest."" JOKIC'S NIGHT Jokic did a little bit of everything, including a pass off the backboard to himself for a layup and another full-length pass for an easy basket. The team is now 24-4 when Jokic goes for a triple-double, including 16-0 at home.","401071533"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  James Harden was Josh Okogie's responsibility for much of Wednesday night. Even though Harden piled up 42 points, Okogie's teammates were full of praise for the Nigerian rookie. ""It wasn't a good 42,"" Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""It wasn't a 42 that he's been getting recently, you know. He had to work for it."" Towns had 25 points, Jeff Teague had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and Okogie locked down Harden when it counted most to help the Timberwolves beat the Houston Rockets 121-111. Harden scored 30 or more points for the 31st consecutive game, tying Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest streak in league history. But it was Okogie -- who had 16 points -- drawing the most praise for making some key defensive stops. Most notably, Okogie brought the crowd to its feet with an impressive block that helped turn the tide. After being stripped by Okogie a few plays earlier, Harden made one of his trademark step-back moves behind the arc to attempt a 3. The ball didn't even leave his hand before Okogie leaped forward and stuffed it. ""I knew the shot clock was winding down, and I knew that he had to create some space to get a shot off,"" Okogie said. ""And I knew obviously the step back is one of his go-to moves, so I kind of just guessed, and I was right."" A few plays earlier, Okogie sparked the Timberwolves to retake the lead with an 18-2 run in the third, including a breakaway dunk and a 3-pointer to give Minnesota a 77-74 lead. ""We saw him grow up tonight in a lot of ways, I thought,"" Timberwolves interim coach Ryan Saunders said of Okogie. ""In terms of game plan, following the game plan, just staying within the moment and not getting outside of himself."" Derrick Rose completed a three-point play with 1:43 left in the third to give Minnesota an 85-76 lead. Harden's 12-footer made it 89-all in the fourth before the Timberwolves hit four 3-pointers to take a six-point lead. Harden hit three-straight 3-pointers to pull Houston within 115-111 with 1:52 to play. But Okogie dunked and forced Harden into an airball, and Towns hit a layup to give Minnesota just enough breathing room. ""You could feel the whole game there wasn't enough enthusiasm, not enough want,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""When we do that, we struggle because we're not physical like the other teams."" TYING WILT'S RECORD Harden shot 15 of 34 from the field, including 8 of 22 from 3-point range. He passed the 30-point mark on his 15th four-point play of the season, getting Okogie in the air with a step-back 3 to put Houston up 74-67 midway through the third. It was also his 22nd 40-point game of the season. He wasn't in a mood to say much about it afterward. ""To me, we have no tendencies right now. The tendency is just to come out slow in the third quarters,"" he said. BRUTAL PAINT JOB Minnesota outscored Houston 70-36 in the paint, as the Timberwolves used sharp passes to find several open layups. ""The way they're scoring was almost effortless,"" Houston guard Chris Paul said. ""We just couldn't stop them. Teague lived the paint. Guys were driving. I think we're 0-2 against them, so we've got to be better."" TIP INS Rockets: D'Antoni said C Clint Capela is expected to practice next week to determine if he can play next Thursday at the Lakers. Capela missed his 15th game with a right thumb injury suffered at Orland on Jan. 13. ... Gerald Green scored 10 points off the bench in the first quarter, including 2 of 3 from the arc. Timberwolves: Teague is averaging 19.3 points and nine assists in his three games since returning from a sore left foot. ... F Andrew Wiggins missed his second straight game with an illness. F Robert Covington (knee) and G Tyus Jones (ankle) missed their 20th and 13th games, respectively. ... Dario Saric again started in place of Taj Gibson.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  With a drama-filled victory over the Warriors that included the ejection of Golden State coach Steve Kerr, the Portland Trail Blazers got a confidence boost heading into the All-Star break. Damian Lillard scored 29 points and the Blazers snapped Golden State's five-game winning streak with a 129-107 win Wednesday night. Jake Layman added 17 points off the bench for the Blazers, who rebounded after a two-game skid. ""It's really important when you can collect yourself and come home against the best team in the league right now, and just get it done,"" Lillard said. ""I thought that said a lot about our team, our growth."" Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry each had 32 points for the Warriors, who rested DeMarcus Cousins following a victory at home over Utah the night before. Despite the loss, which ended an 11-game winning streak on the road, Golden State still goes into the break with the best record in the Western Conference. After a tight three quarters, Layman's long jumper gave Portland a 104-101 lead in the final period before Zach Collins blocked Damion Lee's layup on the other end. Collins and Klay Thompson exchanged words, and the frustration spilled over to players from both sides. The two players were given offsetting technical fouls. Portland led 110-103 before Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul on Collins with 3:54 left. Kerr reacted angrily, throwing his clipboard to court and yelling at the officials before he was ejected. Lillard made the three technical shots and Collins made his free throws to give Portland a 115-103 lead. Layman added a 3-pointer to all but seal the win. The Warriors finished with just 12 points in the final quarter. Green praised Kerr for standing up for him: ""That was amazing, he was great. I enjoyed that."" Kerr said he was shocked when officials looked at the replay and determined it was a flagrant. ""We'll obviously get an explanation from the league, but I just thought it was a good, hard foul,"" Kerr said. ""I guess I was wrong."" In addition to Cousins, the Warriors rested guard Shaun Livingston and forward Andre Iguodala. Kerr said before the game that Cousins and Livingston got the night off because of the back-to-back games, and Iguodala was additionally a ""little banged up."" The Warriors started Kevon Looney in Cousins' place. Durant led all scorers with 16 points in the first quarter, and Golden State led 33-31. Durant played just five minutes of the second quarter as the Warriors turned to their bench and finished the half with 20 points. The first half was close -- Portland held a slim 64-61 lead at the break -- and it stayed close in the third quarter. Looney's basket tied it at 75 with just under nine minutes to go in the period. The game first got testy midway through the quarter when Durant pushed Nurkic after the two appeared to exchange words, but the officials quickly diffused the situation. Curry made back-to-back 3-pointers and the Warriors took a 93-88 lead, but Lillard answered with a 3. The Blazers had eight players in double figures for the second time this season. Jusuf Nurkic had 11 points and 11 rebounds. It was the last game before the All-Star break for both teams. ""(I'm) really pleased with where we are at the All-Star break,"" Kerr said. ""Everybody's gonna have a chance to get away a little bit, then come back for the stretch run."" Earlier in the day, the Blazers signed center Enes Kanter. The New York Knicks, who decided to focus on younger players, were unable to deal Kanter before the trade deadline and waived him instead. Blazers coach Terry Stotts said Kanter will join the team for the Feb. 21 game against Brooklyn following the All-Star break. Kanter will back up Nurkic. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said before the game the team would rely on its bench with three key players missing. Among those expected to see extended minutes was Jordan Bell, who went to Oregon. ""He deserves some action. I'm excited to play him. He's got his Oregon shoes on tonight, representing the Ducks."" Bell had six points and nine rebounds in 16 minutes. Blazers: In addition to Kanter, Portland strengthened its bench prior to the trade deadline with the addition of Rodney Hood. Portland's second unit will now consist of Seth Curry, Layman, Hood, Kanter and Evan Turner. ""The addition of Enes fortifies our front court for this critical late season push,"" said Neil Olshey, Blazers president of basketball operations. ""He's an impact player with playoff experience that will be an excellent fit with our style of play.""","401071535"
"LOS ANGELES --  Lou Williams has a well-earned reputation of providing instant offense off the bench. The Los Angeles Clippers veteran guard did it at a historic level on Wednesday night. Williams scored 30 points and had 10 assists in 22 minutes as the Clippers routed the Phoenix Suns 134-107. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he is the first player in NBA history with at least 30 points and 10 assists in fewer than 23 minutes. It was also the 27th game of his 13-year career in which he has scored 30 or more off the bench, tying Ricky Pierce. Williams -- who scored a season-high 45 in Monday's loss at Minnesota -- was just as quick out of Staples Center. He showered and left before the locker room was open to the media. One reason might have been was that it was the final game before the All-Star break. ""That's impressive but he's been doing that all year,"" Clippers guard Patrick Beverley said of Williams' night. ""It's been fun to watch. Sometimes you get caught up watching him sometimes."" Williams scored 11 points during the first quarter as the Clippers led 32-22 after going 12 of 21 from the field. It was also a record night for the Suns, but for the wrong reason. They have lost 15 straight, tying a franchise mark set late last season (March 2 to April 1). The average losing margin during the streak is 16.3 points and six of the defeats have been by 20 points or more. Phoenix (11-48) has the worst record in the Western Conference and second-worst mark in the league. ""It's very discouraging. We show signs here and there but we have to put it all together,"" said guard Kelly Oubre Jr., who had a career-high 28 points. ""The only way is up. Right now, we're at the bottom."" Danilo Gallinari scored 20 points and Montrezl Harrell 19 for the Clippers, who shot a season-high 59.5 percent from the floor. Los Angeles is still a work in progress after a series of moves before last week's trade deadline. Landry Shamet, who was acquired from Philadelphia on Feb. 6, got his first Clippers' start while Garrett Temple and Ivica Zubac, who came in separate deals on Feb. 7, also played over 20 minutes. ""We're getting there. We still don't have a lot of the offense in but we'll have two important practices next week before going back on the road,"" coach Doc Rivers said. The Clippers led for most of the game and pushed the margin to double digits for the final 27 minutes. They led by as many as 31 during the third quarter. Los Angeles led 67-51 at halftime, and put the game out of reach during a two-minute stretch in the third quarter when it scored 13 straight points to lead 82-55 with 7:12 remaining. Gallinari fueled the run with three straight 3-pointers. The Clippers go into the break 32-27 while holding the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference. ""I don't know what the number (of wins) is to get to the playoffs,"" Gallinari said. ""We just have to take every game and win as many as possible."" TIP-INS Suns: Deandre Ayton added 20 points along with eight rebounds. Kokoskov said T.J. Warren is making progress from his right ankle injury and is likely to return after the All-Star break. The forward has missed the last 10 games. Clippers: Zubac scored 16 points and had seven rebounds. Los Angeles had 100 points at the end of three quarters, marking the fifth time this season it had reached the century mark before the start of the fourth quarter.","401071536"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic ended one streak and stretched another. The Magic snapped a 13-game losing streak to Charlotte, routing the Hornets 127-89 on Thursday night behind 21 points from reserve Terrence Ross. ""It's like there has been a paradigm shift, if that makes sense,"" Magic forward Aaron Gordon said. ""They've been whipping us for so long, but I'm glad we got `em this time."" The Magic have won five straight for the first time in more than three years. Nikola Vucevic had his fifth straight double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds, while Gordon added 10 points and 10 rebounds. Jonathan Isaac scored 16 points. ""It's been a great performance by this team the last five games,"" Vucevic said. ""Not only the wins, but the way we've been playing. Really impressive performances on both ends of the floor. A lot of guys scoring in double digits, playing together, defending well."" The Magic led 71-36 at halftime, their biggest lead in any game this season. Guard D.J. Augustin drilled a 3-pointer on the first possession of the second half and the Hornets never got closer than 29 points after halftime. Malik Monk scored 15 points, Jeremy Lamb had 14 and Cody Zeller added 13 for the Hornets. It was Orlando's first victory over Charlotte since Dec. 16, 2015. ""I don't know what it is, what has ignited this stretch, but we've finally found a way to come together,"" Isaac said. Charlotte started poorly and got worse throughout a forgettable first half. The Hornets were only 6 of 24 in the first quarter and were already down 15 by the end of the period. The deficit grew to 36 when Orlando outscored the Hornets 16-6 in the final three minutes of the half. ""We were terrible tonight. We were awful and they were good,"" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. ""We were not competing, not having pride about your job, not making shots . we were just terrible and we need a break."" The Magic probably are thinking just the opposite. They have beaten opponents by an average of 22.5 points during the win streak and limited them to below 40 percent shooting from the field. Orlando made 17 3-pointers against the Hornets. ""When the ball goes in the basket, everything else becomes much easier,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""In terms of how we're playing, yes, the All-Star break is coming at a bad time. This is the best we've played all year, but you can see we're tired. We all need a break."" The Magic dominated the game at both ends of the court, but most of it was fueled by a relentless defense that limited Charlotte to 26.4 percent shooting for the half. All-Star Kemba Walker, who has made a career of shooting down the Magic during the 13-game winning streak, was 1 for 10 at the start and only 4 of 17 by halftime. He had a plus-minus rating of minus-27 at halftime and only played seven minutes in the second half before sitting down for the night. Orlando was almost as good offensively, getting contributions from every player, especially the fast-developing Isaac. The Magic's top pick in the 2017 draft had 13 points and six rebounds at halftime, and was the anchor at the back end of the team's defense. Charlotte hit just nine of 25 shots in the paint in the first half. TIP-INS Hornets: PG Tony Parker (back) and C Bismack Biyombo (knee) sat out. Charlotte is 1-10 without Parker. . The Hornets are 1-10 when they score fewer than 100 points. Magic: Isaac's streak of seven straight games with two or more blocks ended. . Orlando is limiting opponents to just 39.6 percent shooting during its five-game winning streak. FULTZ APPEARS Markelle Fultz, traded to Orlando on Feb. 7, made his first appearance in front of the Magic media Thursday, but won't be in town long. Fultz answered questions and sat on the Magic bench during their game, but will be on a flight to Los Angeles on Friday to resume rehabilitation on his injured shoulder. ""Rehab is going great,"" said Fultz, who added there was no timeline for his return to action. ""This is an opportunity for me to get a fresh start with the team, coaching staff and organization. They've been about building me up both as a man and on the court. That's music to my ears, really."" Fultz, the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA draft by Philadelphia, was traded to the Magic in exchange for reserve forward Johnathon Simmons, a top-20 protected first round pick in 2020 and a second-round pick this summer.","401071537"
"ATLANTA --  Knicks coach David Fizdale gives his team credit for not giving up during a losing streak that lasted nearly six weeks. ""I keep talking about this team's character,"" Fizdale said. ""It would've been very easy for us to check out and get on to wherever we're going to go, but we were desperate men. Those guys wanted this game really badly, and they came out and showed it."" Dennis Smith Jr. scored 19 points and New York snapped a franchise-worst, 18-game losing streak with a 106-91 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. The Knicks ended their longest skid within a single season with their first victory since Jan. 4 at the Los Angeles Lakers. New York, with the Eastern Conference's worst record and second-worst overall, had dropped 26 of 27. Kadeem Allen and John Jenkins each added 14 points. Damyean Dotson finished with 13 points and DeAndre Jordan had 13 rebounds for New York, which never trailed and only was tied twice, in the second quarter. ""I think we did a great job of guarding the pick-and-rolls tonight,"" Smith said. ""Our bigs did a good job of calling out the screens and switching and not giving them too many second chances."" The Hawks, coming off an exciting victory over the Lakers two nights earlier, were flat throughout. They never pulled within single digits after John Collins' hook shot made it 87-78 with 9:39 remaining. Dewayne Dedmon led Atlanta with 21 points. Trae Young had 16 points and 11 assists. The Knicks were up 14-0 before ending the first with a 28-13 lead. Mitchell Robinson closed the period by blocking DeAndre' Bembry's 3-point attempt. Atlanta missed its first 11 shots as its starters combined for two points. ""We can't start the game like we did and expect to get a win,"" Young said. ""We've just got to learn from it and get better and regroup after the All-Star Game."" The Hawks, who trailed 54-51 at halftime, have lost four of five. ""I like where we're headed,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said of his team's overall play this season. ""As a first-time coach, I didn't know if I'd be fighting players every day or disgruntled guys or guys not buying into it, but I think the guys buy into it and they enjoy each other. They enjoy my staff, which is very important."" TIP-INS Knicks: Mario Hezonja missed the game with a left leg contusion. Fizdale said Hezonja was kicked in Wednesday's home loss to Philadelphia. ... Luke Kornet made his 11th start and finished with 11 points. Hawks: Young began the game averaging 16.9 points and 7.6 assists. Since 1997-98, only Chris Paul in 2005-06 and John Wall in 2010-11 averaged at least 16 points and seven assists over a full rookie season. STAY IN SHAPE Fizdale wants the Knicks to use the upcoming All-Star break to rest and maintain their conditioning. ""I'm not letting my foot off the gas,"" he said with a smile. HAIL TO THE CHIEF Former President Jimmy Carter, 94, and his wife Rosalynn, 91, attended the game and were introduced to a standing ovation during a timeout early in the first. The Hawks did a video presentation of Carter's career in humanitarian causes, politics and philanthropy. Carter, the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2002, just won his third Grammy for best spoken word album on ""Faith: A Journey for All."" PRIDE TIME The Hawks held a Love Wins Pride Night promotion that featured the Atlanta Gay Men's Chorus singing the national anthem and the team calling attention throughout the night to the LGBT community. The outside ""Atlanta"" facade of State Farm Arena was lit in rainbow colors. The Hawks dressed their mascot Harry in a rainbow Mohawk and had him waving a large rainbow flag with their logo in the center.","401071538"
"Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry brushes off questions regarding Anthony Davis, opens up about the Pelicans' season, then walks away to end his media session. (0:47) NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis grimaced and didn't move his left arm as he walked off the court at halftime. Whether those were Davis' final moments in a Pelicans uniform -- or whether he even plays in this weekend's All-Star Game -- remains to be seen. Julius Randle capped a 33-point, 11-rebound performance with three clutch baskets in the final three minutes, Jrue Holiday scored 32 points and effectively defended Paul George, and New Orleans beat Oklahoma City 131-122 on Thursday night despite losing Davis to a shoulder injury. Davis, who has asked to be traded, left the Smoothie King Center with his agent, Rich Paul, during the second half to get an MRI exam, the results of which were expected by Friday. But it's only a matter of time before the Pelicans have to learn to play without Davis for good anyway, and they managed rather well following the six-time All-Star's departure against record-setting guard Russell Westbrook and the Thunder. ""To tell you the truth, this whole thing has been a dumpster fire,"" coach Alvin Gentry said, alluding to the effect Davis' trade demand has had on the rest of the team. ""It's hard for guys to go through what they've been through, and to be able to come out and beat a team of that quality, I'm happy for all the guys."" But Gentry lost his patience when asked to elaborate on Davis leaving the arena during the game. ""I'm going to talk about the guys that played. They did a great job,"" Gentry said. ""We found a way to win the game. That's what's important."" Gentry then stormed off, ending his postgame interview session in uncharacteristically abrupt fashion. Westbrook increased his record triple-double streak to 11 games with 44 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. But he missed a late 3-point attempt when the Thunder trailed by five just inside the final minute of the game. New Orleans rebounded and held on from there. ""They played good, man,"" Westbrook said of the Pelicans, who snapped the Thunder's four-game winning streak. ""Honestly, the stuff that's going on around here, I don't really know much about, but they won tonight and that's all the matters."" Paul George scored 28 points for Oklahoma City, but made only 3 of 17 3-point attempts. ""A couple of them was in and out where it felt really good. A couple of them I wish I could have back,"" said George, who also gave Holiday credit for his defensive effort. ""He's scrappy and he takes pride in defense. Not a lot of guys do. I have the utmost respect for his approach and how he defends and wants to play defense."" Davis was in the game when the first half ended, but kept his left arm still as he walked to the locker room shortly after fouling Nerlens Noel on an attempted shot block with his left hand in the final second of the second quarter. When the second half began, the Pelicans announced that Davis was out of the remainder of the game with a left shoulder injury, putting his availability for this weekend's All-Star Game in doubt. Davis was in the starting lineup and played 16 minutes, scoring 14 points to go with four rebounds, two assists and a block. His performance helped New Orleans take a 66-63 lead into halftime. Coming off a listless, 30-point loss to Orlando two nights earlier in which Davis scored just three points on 1-of-9 shooting, the Pelicans bounced back with a far superior showing against a team with the third-best record in the Western Conference. The Pelicans led for most of the game and by as many as 17 in the third quarter. The Thunder pulled as close as 121-118 with 2:52 left, when George hit a straight-on 3, hollering and pounding his chest after the shot went down. But the Pelicans didn't fold thanks to Randle, who responded by tipping in Kenrich Williams' missed 3-pointer, then added a layup with 1:30 to go and an 8-foot fall-away with 1:12 left. TIP-INS Thunder:  Noel had 22 points and 13 rebounds. He was the only other Thunder player besides Westbrook and George to score as many as 10 points. ... Oklahoma City had 72 points in the paint but missed 34 of 44 3-point attempts. ... Westbrook was 4 of 12 from deep. Pelicans: E'Twaun Moore intentionally fouled Ray Felton so he could check out of the game and limped to the bench favoring his left knee with 31 seconds left in the first quarter. He returned in the second quarter and finished with 15 points. ... Jahlil Okafor scored 12 points. ... Gentry said before tip-off that guard Elfrid Payton is expected to return from a right ankle sprain after the All-Star break. RECORD SETTER In addition to increasing his triple-double streak, Westbrook surpassed Gary Payton (18,207 points) as the career scoring leader in franchise history. Westbrook's tally in New Orleans gives him 18,247. ""I didn't know I was close, honestly. So that's crazy, man,"" Westbrook said. ""Just truly honored and blessed obviously to be in one place, organization. To be able to be the all-time leading scorer in a place is a pretty big accomplishment, I must say, so I'm just truly thankful and humbled.""","401071539"
"CLEVELAND --  Kevin Love's presence makes an obvious difference for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Playing his third game since returning from foot surgery, Love had 16 points and 11 rebounds and Cleveland sent the Phoenix Suns to a franchise-record 16th straight loss, 111-98 on Thursday night. ""He's a walking double-double,"" Cleveland forward Larry Nance Jr. said ""That's something he's been his whole career and it's certainly not going to change now."" Cedi Osman scored 19 points for Cleveland while NBA-worst Phoenix (11-49) topped the record of 15 set March 2- April 1, 2018. The Suns' last victory was Jan. 12 over Denver. Devin Booker scored 30 points for Phoenix, and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 23. The Suns have allowed at least 110 points in each game of the losing streak. ""You have to change something where we're at the point we're at,"" Booker said. ""We have to hold people accountable. You can't take things personally when a guy calls you out. We need to start not being scared to step on people's toes when something is wrong."" Love played 22 minutes and was 6 of 13 from the field. He played nearly 16 minutes Feb. 21 against New York and sat out the final game before the All-Star break against Brooklyn two days later. Love, who committed three turnovers in the first quarter, admitted he's still shaking off some rust. ""I looked like I hadn't played many games lately and looked like I had just come off break,"" he said. ""That will go away. Couple shots were pretty short, getting my legs underneath me, but overall I felt pretty good and just kind of progress in these minutes."" The Cavaliers plan to steadily increase Love's playing time over the next several games as he rebuilds his stamina after missing over 50 games because of the surgery in November. Ante Zizic had 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers. Cleveland trailed 72-71 late in the third quarter before taking control with a 12-0 run. The Cavaliers scored 34 points in the fourth quarter, leading by as much as 17. Cleveland had 34 assists -- one short of a season high -- led by Matthew Dellavedova with 11. TIP-INS Suns: F T.J. Warren (sore right ankle) missed his 11th straight game. He worked out at Quicken Loans Arena but has not progressed beyond shooting drills. ... Interim co-general manager James Jones accompanied the team to Cleveland. He spent the final three seasons of his career with the Cavaliers and was a member of their 2016 NBA championship squad. Cavaliers: Love picked up four fouls in the first half. .... F Tristan Thompson (sore left foot) practiced Wednesday, but missed his 14th straight game. LOOKING AHEAD Cleveland (13-46) has the second-worst record in the East. Both teams are in line for a prime spot in the May 14 draft lottery. The league's three worst teams will have a 14 percent chance for the first pick in the draft and a chance to take Duke star Zion Williamson. IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE Cavaliers coach Larry Drew hadn't seen the video of Williamson's knee injury when the projected top pick blew out his shoe Wednesday night. Drew said the same thing happened to him in the early 1990s during training camp while he played for the Los Angeles Lakers, but he wasn't injured. ""It was kind a weird thing that happened,"" he said. ""I was in Hawaii. We were playing in a small gym that had no air conditioning. Shoes got saturated very quickly. I tried to come to a step and my foot right came out the side of my shoe."" NUMBERS DON'T LIE Suns coach Igor Kokoskov admitted there's no way to sugarcoat his team's predicament. ""We all feel bad about it, but that's who we are right now with our record,"" he said. ""That's not opinion, that's just fact. You can't be lackadaisical and take any possession off. When you have a young team, players need to understand that every possession, every shot, every screen is important.""","401071540"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Boban Marjanovic covered up All-Star center Joel Embiid's absence -- at least for a night. Marjanovic had 19 points and 12 rebounds and made three key free throws in the final 1 1/2 minutes to help Philadelphia 76ers beat the Miami Heat 106-102 on Thursday night. ""He was our bell-ringer tonight,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Tobias Harris had 12 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and JJ Redick hit a late 3-pointer to help Philadelphia win its first game without Embiid. He's expected to miss at least a week with a sore left knee. Dwyane Wade scored 19 points for Miami, and Dion Waiters added 18. Miami led 99-98 after Wade's runner with 1:56 left. Marjanovic made two free throws to put Philadelphia ahead 100-99. Following Wade's missed jumper, Redick drained the 3 from the top of the key to make it 103-99 with 1:04 left. Kelly Olynyk then missed a 3-point attempt, and Marjanovic made the first of two free throws with 38.3 ticks left to put Philadelphia up five. ""He was fantastic,"" Redick said about Marjanovic. ""He really stepped up for us tonight."" Perhaps the only way Marjanovic didn't impersonate Embiid was after the game, as he was unavailable for comment due to treatment -- quite unlike the loquacious and quotable Embiid. It was left to his teammates to speak for his performance. ""He's a bucket,"" Butler said. ""All you have to do is throw it to him."" Added Harris, ""I was surprised he didn't shoot a 3 tonight because he had it going."" Marjanovic, starting for Embiid, had 11 points and seven rebounds to help Philadelphia to a 23-13 lead before being lifted with 3:34 left in the first quarter. He returned 3 1/2 minutes into the second, finishing the half with 16 points and eight rebounds while making all six of his field-goal attempts to help the 76ers to a 57-50 halftime lead. He finished 6 for 7 from the field and 7 for 10 from the free-throw line. ""He's incredibly skilled for a man of his size,"" Brown said. WADE'S EXIT The 37-year-old Wade, playing in his last season, was honored early in the first quarter with a highlight video that included a tribute from 76ers great Allen Iverson. Philadelphia fans gave Wade a standing ovation following the video, and the Miami star pounded his heart and waved back in appreciation. Wade was touched by the tribute, particularly by Iverson's inclusion. After Michael Jordan, Iverson was Wade's favorite player growing up. ""To take myself out of the moment and think 20-something odd years later, Allen Iverson would be the one, his voice would be the one dedicating something to me in this arena, in his city, I couldn't have written it any sweeter, any better,"" Wade said. PASSING THE TORCH Simmons and Wade exchanged jerseys after the game. Fresh off his first All-Star appearance and a rising star in the league, Simmons reflected on playing against Wade. ""It's cool to be on the floor with a legend,"" Simmons said. ""It's an amazing feeling."" Simmons, who had 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists, said he wore Wade's brand of sneakers as a kid. TIP-INS Miami: G Goran Dragic was inactive. Dragic, who had right knee surgery in December, practiced Wednesday and a return to the court on Thursday was thought to be a possibility. An All-Star last season, Dragic is averaging 15.3 points and 4.9 assists. ... The Heat dropped to 15-15 on the road. They are 11-16 at home. ... James Johnson left with an apparent left shoulder injury with 8:31 left in the first half and didn't return. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said X-rays were negative and Johnson would have an MRI when the team returns home. ... Derrick Jones Jr. returned after missing eight games due to bone bruises in his right knee. He had nine points. Philadelphia: Philadelphia leads the season series 2-0. The 76ers won 124-114 on Nov. 12 in Miami. The teams will wrap up the series April 9 in Miami. ... Philadelphia improved to 24-7 at home.","401071541"
"NEW YORK --  When Jusuf Nurkic went to the bench, the Portland Trail Blazers inserted a player who barely knew their offense. Imagine how good Portland's center combination can be once Enes Kanter gets up to speed. Nurkic had 27 points and 12 rebounds, Kanter added 18 points and nine boards in his Portland debut, and the Trail Blazers beat the Brooklyn Nets 113-99 on Thursday night. ""Obviously, our two big guys really dominated inside,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. The tandem was so good that the Trail Blazers didn't even need a big night from All-Star guard Damian Lillard, who was just 5 for 21 from the field. He finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""They're going to change the dynamic for a lot of teams, how they guard us obviously,"" Blazers guard CJ McCollum said. Kanter signed last week with the Blazers after losing his job with the Knicks and then getting his release after they couldn't find a deal before the trade deadline. He made his first seven shots and finished 8 for 9, missing only a 3-pointer, as the Blazers relied on a steady diet of pick-and-rolls when he was in to compensate for his unfamiliarity with their sets. Languishing on the bench during much of what became an 18-game losing streak for the Knicks, Kanter was excited to be on the floor in meaningful situations. ""Last time I got a win I think it was like almost two months,"" he said. McCollum added 21 points in a good return from the break for the Blazers after going into it with a 129-107 victory over Golden State. They opened a seven-game road trip and don't play their first home game after the All-Star break until March 7 against Oklahoma City. Allen Crabbe had 17 points for the Nets, who came out of the All-Star break above .500 for the first time since 2013. All-Star guard D'Angelo Russell shot only 4 for 16, finishing with 14 points and eight assists. ""We didn't have great rhythm tonight, didn't play well. I think that's across the board. Didn't coach well, didn't play well,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It was just one of those games where I think Portland was simply the better team. There's just no way around it."" Lillard's 3-pointer midway through the third -- his only one through three quarters -- gave Portland a 69-63 lead that the Blazers would extend largely through Kanter's work inside. He followed with four baskets in the period, including one that gave Portland its largest lead at 82-67. The lead was 14 after his free throws with 10:40 to play before Ed Davis, Shabazz Napier and Crabbe -- all former Blazers -- fueled a 15-2 surge that trimmed it to 90-89. But Portland pushed the lead back into double digits, with Lillard contributing a 3-pointer with a little over 3 minutes to go and Nurkic getting a three-point play when he was fouled on a powerful dunk. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland has won four straight in Brooklyn. ... Al-Farouq Aminu had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Nets: F Jared Dudley returned after missing 16 games with a strained left hamstring. That leaves just sixth man Spencer Dinwiddie on the Nets' injured list, and Atkinson said he is doing plenty of things on the court as he recovers from surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right thumb. BROOKLYN'S BROADCASTER The Nets honored YES Network announcer Ian Eagle for his 25 years calling the team's games. Eagle was presented with a No. 25 Nets jersey with his name on it, and a video tribute featuring former Nets players was played on the video screen. LEVERT IN THE LINEUP Caris LeVert had 12 points on 4-for-11 shooting. He was just 13 for 36 in his first three games since returning from a lengthy absence with a dislocated right foot, but Atkinson kept him in the starting lineup. Atkinson said he still trusted LeVert and thought he was looking good even with his shot not falling yet. ""Obviously we have a long relationship now. He's been here from the beginning and so I'm not thinking of just the past three games, three or four games,"" Atkinson said. ""I'm thinking of preseason and last season and how well he started the season and listen, I think from a physical standpoint he's looked pretty sharp.""","401071542"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo initially thought Kyrie Irving's game-winning attempt was good, but believes he was not fouled on the drive. (0:57) MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks shook off any All-Star break hangover in a hurry. Antetokounmpo scored 12 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, Khris Middleton hit a 3-pointer in the closing seconds and the NBA-leading Bucks held off the Boston Celtics 98-97 on Thursday night. On the second-to-last position, Marcus Smart forced a jump ball with Antetokounmpo. Antetokounmpo tipped the jump to Brook Lopez, who deflected it toward the basket, but missed as the shot clock expired. The referees huddled during the timeout and put 3.5 seconds on the clock for the Celtics. Crew chief Mike Callahan explained the call to a pool reporter after the game. ""With 0.2 seconds, the 24-second clock didn't start until Lopez possessed the ball,"" Callahan said. ""When he possesses the ball, you cannot have a legal shot attempt with 0.2 on the shot clock."" Callahan explained that ""a legal tip play can occur with 0.1 or 0.2 of a second."" Smart inbounded the ball over the towering Lopez and dropped a pass into Kyrie Irving's hands at the top of the key. With Eric Bledsoe draped all over him, Irving drove the lane, seemed to stumble and missed an awkward shot as time expired. The Bucks won the season series 2-1, their first over the Celtics since 2014-15. The Celtics drew up a final play that put the ball in Irving's hands. ""Kyrie with the ball. That's what we wanted,"" Al Horford said. ""Get the ball in Kyrie's hands. Let him create. I felt like we put ourselves in a good position there."" Irving took a philosophical approach. ""It happens,"" he said. ""Just part of the break and coming off and playing the first game, getting the cold ones out."" For Antetokounmpo and Irving, who had 10 of his 22 points in the fourth, it was a rematch since squaring off Sunday at the All-Star Game. Antetokounmpo captained Team Giannis, while Irving started for Team LeBron. Irving, who has battled a variety of injuries this season, used the All-Star Game to get ready for his return to action. He had missed the two previous games with a strained right knee and 11 overall. Antetokounmpo added 13 rebounds, Middleton had 15 points and a season-high 13 rebounds, and Malcolm Brogdon had 15 points for the Bucks. They have won 15 of the last 17 games, including nine of the last 10, to improve to 44-14 and a season-high 30 games over .500. Horford added 21 points and a season-high 17 rebounds for Boston, and Jayson Tatum had 17 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Celtics: F Gordon Hayward did not play after spraining his right ankle during a workout on Tuesday. ... F/C Aron Baynes (left foot contusion) is sitting out the three-game trip. Bucks: Mirotic made his Bucks' debut at forward with three minutes left in the first quarter. He scored 8 points and grabbed three rebounds in almost 14 minutes of action. He missed his first four games with a calf injury. ... G Donte DiVincenzo (bilateral heel bursitis) did not play. QUOTABLES ""That 3 by Middleton at the top of the key really hurt us,"" Horford said about the basket from 27 feet that snapped a 95-all tie. ""I knew it was going in,"" Antetokounmpo said about Middleton's 3. ""I've seen that play a million times happen in practice, in games. He is just so calm in those situations."" ""That's a tough one,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said about not fouling Giannis on the Bucks' last possession. ""We rolled with that. It ended up as good as it could've ended up."" WAYNE EMBRY HONORED Wayne Embry, former Bucks general manager and player, was honored for his accomplishments and impact on the NBA. The State of Wisconsin and the City of Milwaukee declared that Thursday was Wayne Embry Day in a pregame ceremony.  The Bucks also played a video tribute to Embry during the second quarter and introduced him to a standing ovation. Embry became the NBA's first black general manager when the Bucks tabbed him to run the organization from 1972-79. He was NBA Executive of the Year in 1992 and 1998, serving as general manager and later president of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Embry, a five-time NBA All-Star, capped his 11-year playing career with the Bucks in their inaugural 1968-69 season. He won an NBA championship in 1968 with the Celtics.","401071543"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Fresh off his MVP performance in the All-Star game, Kevin Durant made certain the Golden State Warriors got off on the right foot for their stretch run to the playoffs. He also gave Sacramento's prized rookie Marvin Bagley III quite a lesson on defense. Durant had 28 points, nine rebounds and tied his career-high with seven blocks, and the Warriors survived a hectic finish to beat the Kings 125-123 on Thursday night. ""Kevin was tremendous in every aspect, the energy, the cutting, the aggressiveness,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""Defensively he was all over the place. He was really on his game tonight in every way."" Durant's scoring helped the Warriors stay close early but it was his defense that stood out the most. Five of his blocks came against Bagley, the second overall pick in the draft. All five came in the first half. ""Just got lucky,"" Durant said. ""Marvin being the rookie and showing me the ball, I was just swiping."" Stephen Curry scored 36 points, hitting 10 3-pointers. DeMarcus Cousins added 17 points and 10 rebounds in his first game against his former team since signing with the Warriors this past offseason. The Warriors led most of the fourth quarter behind Curry's 11 points. The two-time MVP shot 12 of 23 overall and was 10 of 16 beyond the arc. ""Just figured out the end of the game,"" Durant said. ""We made shots, Steph got it going in the fourth knocking down 3s off the screen. Sometimes you're not going to win it with the team game, the way we always play. Sometimes you're just going to have street ball."" Golden State still had to hold on to avoid back-to-back losses. Sacramento trailed 123-117 with 25.5 seconds remaining but closed within 125-123 following back-to-back 3s by Buddy Hield. After Andre Iguodala missed a pair of free throws, the Kings had a chance to tie but Hield shot an airball as time expired. Golden State won all four games against Sacramento this season. ""They're tough to guard,"" Kerr said of the improving Kings. ""Down the stretch it felt like they got every offensive board. We had to get some big contributions late from Steph and KD, some big baskets from Klay, just to squeak it out."" Bagley III had 28 points and 14 rebounds for the Kings. Hield had 19 points and seven rebounds while De'Aaron Fox added 18 points and eight assists. ""I just want to beat them really bad,"" Bagley said. ""I hate losing to them. We come up close every single time. We have to figure out how to get over that hump."" Sacramento got an early boost from Bagley and led by 11 early in the second quarter. He had 10 points and four rebounds in the first half and spent part of the time trying to defend Durant. Golden State chipped away behind Curry and Durant, and Iguodala dunked off a lob pass from Green. The Kings pulled away again before Durant made a pair of big plays to close out the third quarter. He drove around three Sacramento defenders for an emphatic one-handed dunk then made a deep 3 with two-tenths of a second remaining to pull Golden State within 91-89. TIP-INS Kings: Corey Brewer scored the team's first eight points in the fourth quarter in his first game with Sacramento. Brewer is on his second 10-day contract with the club. ...

"James Harden and Chris Paul voice their frustrations with NBA referee Scott Foster, with Harden saying Foster is ""arrogant"" and that things have become personal. (1:24) LOS ANGELES --  LeBron James knows that he needs to turn up his intensity if the Los Angeles Lakers are going to make the playoffs. He certainly did that on Thursday night against the Houston Rockets when his team needed it the most. James scored 16 of his 29 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from a 19-point deficit midway through the third quarter to defeat the Rockets 111-106. It was Los Angeles' largest comeback win of the season and its sixth when trailing by 15 or more at any point. The previous biggest comeback came on Feb. 7 at Boston when it was down 18 in the second quarter. ""I need to be in that level right now. Knowing the circumstances we are in and kick starting something,"" said James, who also had 11 rebounds and six assists. ""I like where I am at and will continue to get better. Tonight was a step in the right direction."" The Lakers were down 95-88 with 7:49 remaining when they went on a 17-4 run over a six-minute span to take control. James, who scored eight points during the run, gave Los Angeles a 99-97 lead with 4:15 remaining. They would lead by as many as eight in the final minute. After struggling from the field the first three quarters, the Lakers were 8 of 13 from the field and 10 of 11 from the foul line in the final 12 minutes. Houston, which made close to half its shots the first 36 minutes, was just 7 of 19 from the field and 2 of 12 on 3-pointers. It also didn't get to the foul line the final 20 mintues. ""It looked like we got our defensive mojo, our defensive confidence, back as the game went along,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We had to get to different match-ups but we kept scrapping a found a way to give ourselves a chance."" Brandon Ingram had 27 points -- including 11 of 14 from the foul line -- and 13 rebounds. Kyle Kuzma added 18 points. James Harden led Houston with 30 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists before fouling out with 1:24 remaining. It is his 32nd consecutive game where he has scored 30 or more points, overtaking Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest streak in NBA history. Chamberlain also holds the record at 65 games. ""It's a few things like it has been throughout the entire season,"" said Harden on not sustaining a large lead. ""Sooner or later, you have to be able to correct them."" Paul, who had 23 points and 10 rebounds before also fouling out, was an assist shy of a triple double. ""It comes down to where LeBron makes big shots and we didn't,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We probably ran a little bit out of gas. It was a lot of little factors."" Houston led 32-22 at the end of the first quarter when it ended the period with eight straight points, including back-to-back 3-pointers by Faried and Austin Rivers. Harden's jumper gave the Rockets a 52-39 advantage with 4:20 remaining before the Lakers went on an 9-0 run. The Rockets would lead 58-52 at halftime. PLAYOFF CHASE The Lakers evened their record at 28-28 but remain in 10th place in the Western Conference and 2 1/2 games behind the Clippers for the final playoff spot. Their next three games are against teams with losing records and they face the Clippers twice down the stretch. Walton said he has seen a more intense James since the Lakers returned from the All-Star break. ""He's had a more serious look to his face,"" Walton said. ""He recognizes where we are at and the sense of urgency. He was huge tonight but he's always great.""

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nic Batum is back in his comfort zone. The Hornets moved the 10-year NBA veteran back to shooting guard -- a position he's played for the better part of the last seven seasons -- and it paid immediate dividends. Kemba Walker had 27 points and 11 assists in his first outing since the All-Star game, Batum added 20 points -- one shy of his season high -- and Charlotte beat the Washington Wizards 123-110 Friday night. ""That's me,"" a smiling Batum said of playing shooting guard. The Hornets overcame a season-high 46 points from Washington's Bradley Beal to improve to 20-9 at home and pull within two games of .500. Hornets coach James Borrego made the decision to move Batum to shooting guard on Thursday, opting to replace Jeremy Lamb in the starting lineup with rookie small forward Miles Bridges, giving the team more size. Lamb had started all 54 games he was healthy before the All-Star break. It's the first time Borrego has deviated from the starting lineup for a reason other than an injury. Batum responded by shooting 7 of 13 from the field with five 3-pointers, and had eight rebounds after coming into the game averaging just 9.3 points. He was taking heat from home fans who wanted him to produce more, given he is making $24 million per season. He had 17 points by halftime, helping the Hornets outscore the Wizards 38-22 in the second quarter. He mostly played the role of facilitator in the second half. ""He came out aggressive offensively, ignited a lot of our offense in transition,"" Borrego said. ""He was aggressive with his shot and he defended like he does every night."" Bridges finished with 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting in his first career start. He said he was excited to learn the news at practice on Thursday, just five days after participating in the NBA All-Star dunk competition. ""I definitely got a lot of confidence playing on a big stage, or dunking on a big stage, in front of everybody,"" Batum said. ""Just being around all that talent just gave me extra motivation, I want to be there playing (in the All-Star game) on Sunday someday."" Lamb wasn't bad in the sixth-man role, scoring 16 points to hand the Wizards their sixth loss in the last eight games. He said he still wants to be a starter, but added that he's OK with the move if it means getting into the playoffs. Beal kept the Wizards in the game until late in the fourth quarter, proving to be a one-man wrecking crew. He finished 16 of 25 from the field and made all 10 of his foul shots. ""I just have to elevate my play, that's all I know I can do is elevate my play and my leadership to do whatever it takes,"" Beal said of trying to help the Wizards turn things around. TIP INS Wizards: Beal had 20 points in the first half on 8-of-12 shooting. ... Turned the ball over on three straight possessions at midcourt in the second quarter on poor passes. Hornets: Outrebounded the Wizards 53-43. BEAL'S PLAYING TIME Beal played 41 minutes on the first night of a back-to-back, which Wizards coach Scott Brooks said he doesn't like to do. But he thought it was necessary for his team to have a chance to win an important game against a conference foe they're battling with for a playoff spot. ""We've got another game (Saturday) and then we've got three days off. We just had a long break,"" Brooks said. ""So that's all in consideration, but we need some better all-around play with everybody in the game."" BRIDGES' ROLE Borrego said the Hornets want to groom Bridges to guard the opposition's best offensive player, something he believes the athletic rookie has the talent to do. But it will be a work in progress, as Bridges struggled in the times he tried to cover Beal. CODY'S BIG PLAYS Charlotte took control of the game in the third quarter behind defense from Zeller. Zeller swatted Thomas Bryant's shot in the paint twice, then raced down court to score a layup in transition to give the Hornets their first double-digit lead at 78-67. Zeller finished with 11 points and nine rebounds.","401071546"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  With All-Star guard Victor Oladipo out, new addition Wesley Matthews has helped the Indiana Pacers adapt. Matthews scored 15 of his 24 points during a third-quarter rally and the Pacers overcame a 20-point deficit to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 126-111 on Friday night. ""What you saw was a team that looked like they had come off a break and was still on break for the first half,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""The second half, we came out there and started playing the basketball we're capable of playing."" The Pacers also took advantage of a short night from disgruntled Pelicans star Anthony Davis. New Orleans interim general manager Danny Ferry said Thursday that Davis would see limited minutes the rest of the season while New Orleans focuses ""on the future of the team."" Davis played 20 minutes, getting 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists. It's unclear if he'll play against the Lakers on Saturday night. In his third game since being cut by the Knicks and joining Indiana, Matthews sparked a second-half surge when he drained a 3-pointer with 2.5 seconds remaining in the second quarter, cutting New Orleans' lead to 13 after it reached 20 a few minutes earlier. Indiana trailed 71-58 at halftime and didn't lead until Matthews' three free throws with 6:23 remaining in the third quarter. Matthews provided momentum for Indiana through the remainder of the quarter, setting up Tyreke Evan's 3-pointer with 3 seconds left in the third. Indiana took a three-point lead and never looked back. ""We didn't come out with the right energy to start this game,"" Matthews said. ""It was up to us to correct it in the second half."" Domantas Sabonis had 18 points and 12 rebounds. Sabonis got his 23rd double-double of the season, and Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points for Indiana. Six Pelicans scored in double figures, led by Cheick Diallo's 16 points. Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton each had 15 points. New Orleans outscored Indiana in the paint and on fast breaks, but the Pacers' performance in the final two periods overcame that. It was the first time Indiana won by at least 10 points after trailing by at least 20 since December 2015. ""I don't think we played with the same energy starting the third quarter that we started the game with,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We had a couple of plays that was such a momentum swing, a couple of layups here and there (missed) and they come down and make a 3-point shot. They're a really good team and they're going to stay in the game and continue to claw away at it."" BIG EASY Davis has made it clear he won't re-sign with New Orleans when his contract ends after next season, so the Pelicans plan to scale back his usage. He still has to play, though, due to NBA rules that dictate healthy players must suit up, especially on the road and on national television. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans' 71 first-half points were one point shy of its season high. ... The Pelicans are 0-17 on the road when they trail at the end of the third quarter. ... New Orleans blew a double-digit lead against Indiana in both meetings this season. Pacers: Myles Turner was ruled out with a bruised left hip. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Lauri Markkannen shooting free throws was a fitting way for the Chicago Bulls to finish off the Orlando Magic on Friday night. After being fouled by Aaron Gordon on a 3-pointer with 1.5 seconds left, Markannen missed the first attempt -- the Bulls' only miss of the game in 19 attempts -- and made the next two for a 111-109 victory. The Magic missed 11 of 24 free throws, two by B.J. Augustin with 34 seconds left. He went into the game as the NBA's 12th-leading free-throw shooter at 87.3 percent. ""When you look back at the game, we lost on so many things, like free throws, the fouling, the missed coverage on Markannen,"" said Evan Fournier, who led Orlando with 22 points. ""It's tough."" The Magic came out of the All-Star break on a season-high five-game win streak. A win night would have given them their longest winning streak since a nine-game run in the middle of the 2010-11 season. Markannen finished with 25 points and 11 rebounds. Zach LaVine added 22 points for the Bulls, Robin Lopez had 18 and Otto Porter Jr. 17. ""That was a lot of back and forth basketball,"" LaVine said. ""We're making a shot and they're making a shot. It's fun basketball, as long as you end up with the win."" The Magic's streak ended because of their failures at the finish. Aside from the foul on Gordon was coach Steve Clifford's decision to keep All-Star center Nikola Vucevic on the bench after a timeout in the final minute. Bulls center Lopez promptly came up with an offensive rebound and scored, putting the Chicago up 108-106. ""I didn't see they put Lopez back in the game and we ended up too small out there and ended up giving up an offensive rebound, and that was as big a possession as the foul, as big a possession as the missed free throws,"" Clifford said. ""So nobody made a bigger mistake than I did."" Vucevic, who finished 19 points and 13 rebounds, appreciated Clifford's candor. ""You respect when a coach comes in like that and takes accountability for a mistake. It shows he means what he says,"" Vucevic said. ""But it doesn't come down to one play. There were a lot of things we didn't do as players.' The Bulls won their second straight, but only their fifth in the last 23 games. ""Both teams threw punches and both teams had deficits they had to overcome,"" coach Jim Boylen said. ""That's the kind of game you want to play in."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago split four games against the Magic this season. Magic: David Steele, who called his 2,396th game as the team's radio or TV voice, was inducted as the eighth member of the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame.","401071548"

Kawhi Leonard stole the ball from DeRozan to score the go-ahead dunk with 15 seconds left and the Raptors beat the San Antonio Spurs 120-117 on Friday night, spoiling the former Toronto star's return to Canada. ""Tonight was like a playoff game,"" Leonard said. ""We had to grind it out all the way to the end."" Leonard scored 19 of his 25 points in the second half, and combined with Kyle Lowry to strip DeRozan at midcourt before racing in alone for a one-handed slam. ""I knew they were going to be aggressive, trying to make a play on the ball and then foul,"" DeRozan said. ""I've just got to be more aware."" Traded to San Antonio in the offseason deal that sent Leonard to Toronto, DeRozan received a warm welcome but was denied a second victory over his former team. He finished with 23 points. Lowry and DeRozan embraced near center court following the final whistle as the sellout crowd of 20,058 cheered its approval. Fans rose for a standing ovation when DeRozan and the Spurs jogged out for pregame warmups, and were on their feet again when San Antonio's starters were introduced. The longest, loudest cheer came after a tribute video that ran during the first timeout. With the crowd roaring, DeRozan got up from the bench and walked onto the court, acknowledging the fans with several waves. ""To come back here and get a reception like that is definitely humbling, beyond gratifying,"" DeRozan said. ""I appreciate it."" Pascal Siakam scored 22 points to help Toronto win its seventh straight game. Lowry and Danny Green each had 17, Serge Ibaka had 13 points and 15 rebounds, and Jeremy Lin had 11 points in his second game with the Raptors. ""It was fun, pretty fun,"" Lowry said. ""Especially because we got the win. If we lost, it would have been terrible."" Marco Belinelli scored 21 points for San Antonio, Davis Bertans had 16, and former Raptor Rudy Gay added 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Spurs have lost five of six. ""I thought it was a great game, a real competitive game,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. The Raptors took a 101-100 lead on Lin's jumper with 6:52 to go -- part of a 9-0 run. San Antonio overcame a six-point deficit, reclaiming the lead on Bertans' two free throws with 1:36 left -- the first of four lead changes in the final 1:36. Bertans missed a potential go-ahead basket with less than 3 seconds left, and Lowry sealed victory by grabbing the rebound. Leonard made two free throws with less than a second to play before Belinelli missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer at the final buzzer. TIP-INS Spurs: DeRozan had eight assists. He had his first career triple-double when the Spurs routed the Raptors 125-107 in Texas on Jan. 3, finishing with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. ... G Derrick White returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous five games because of a sore right heel. He scored seven points in 20 minutes. ... C Jakob Poeltl, who was traded along with DeRozan, got a nice cheer when he entered the game late in the first. Raptors: Raptors coach Nick Nurse was ejected after picking up a pair of technical fouls for arguing a blocking call against Green in the third. ... Leonard shot 2 for 12 in the first half and Toronto was 5 of 30 on 2-point attempts in the opening two quarters. ... G Jodie Meeks dressed but did not play in his first game since signing a 10-day contract Wednesday. ... Toronto is 17-6 against Western Conference opponents. SERGE-ING Ibaka has scored 10 or more in 21 straight games, matching a career-best streak. He also did it in 2014. EXCHANGE RATE Lowry said DeRozan picked up the tab when the two friends met for dinner Thursday night. ""His American dollars are strong right now so we took advantage,"" Lowry joked.","401071549"
"ATLANTA --  The Detroit Pistons were upset to see Blake Griffin ejected -- especially when they believed their best player didn't deserve the punishment. Even so, the Pistons answered their coach's call to add fuel to their playoff push. Thon Maker sank a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 16.7 seconds remaining and the Pistons overcame Griffin's absence to beat the Atlanta Hawks 125-122 on Friday night. Reggie Jackson scored a season-high 32 points, Andre Drummond had 26 points and 21 rebounds, but the Pistons struggled to overcome Griffin's third-quarter exit following his second technical foul of the period. ""The tape pretty much speaks for itself,"" Griffin said. ""I shouldn't have been back here (in the locker room), but it was an unbelievable job from our guys."" Griffin drew his first technical following a brief battle for the ball with Dewayne Dedmon. After hitting a 3-pointer less than a minute later, Griffin yelled at the Hawks bench and drew the technical for taunting with 4:19 remaining in the period. With the second technical, the ejection was automatic -- much to the dismay of Griffin and coach Dwane Casey. Casey said each technical was ""questionable"" and said ""I've never seen that in my coaching career."" Hawks forward Vince Carter said he was too far down the court to hear what Griffin yelled. ""I don't know what he said, but he was barking and directed it at coach,"" Carter said. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said he wasn't upset even if Griffin's taunt was directed his way. ""I don't know what he said, but it was aggressive and it was in front of the official and it was toward our bench, maybe toward me,"" Pierce said. ""Guys do it all the time. I don't take it personally. ... It's just the technicality of it, you can't taunt a bench when you have a tech already."" Griffin scored 15 points, ending a streak of four straight games with at least 25. Drummond made two free throws to tie it at 122 with 43 seconds remaining. Trae Young, who led Atlanta with 30 points and 10 assists, missed on a short floater. The 7-foot-1 Maker, playing in only his fourth game with Detroit following his Feb. 6 trade from Milwaukee, sank the go-ahead 3-pointer from the corner. ""It means a lot, but we shouldn't have to dig ourselves out of a hole like that,"" Maker said. Young and Vince Carter each missed 3-pointers on Atlanta's final possession. Detroit led 88-77 when Griffin left the game. The Hawks immediately began to cut into the lead, pulling ahead 101-100 on Carter's 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter. Bruce Brown's three-point play gave the lead back to the Pistons. The Hawks have lost five of six but seemed energized in their return from the All-Star break. Atlanta took a big first-half lead of 14 points at 59-45 with a 12-0 run. Young scored on an explosive drive; set up Dedmon's jam with a behind-the-back, through-the-legs dribble ; and sank a 3-pointer to cap the run. Jackson had 15 second-quarter points -- matching Young -- as Detroit cut the Atlanta lead to 70-68 at halftime. The Pistons took the lead early on the second half on two free throws by Jackson. Dedmon had 14 points and 12 rebounds. TIP-INS Pistons: G Wayne Ellington had nine points on three 3-pointers in his first start since signing with the Pistons on Feb. 9. Ellington averaged 8.4 points with Miami this season before he was traded to Phoenix and then waived. Luke Kennard moved to the bench. Hawks: G Kent Bazemore had 12 points as the fill-in starter for rookie Kevin Huerter (left ankle sprain). Huerter is not expected to play in Saturday night's game against Phoenix. ... Young leads all Eastern Conference rookies with 19 double-doubles. DRUMMOND'S DOUBLE-DOUBLES Drummond recorded his fifth straight game with at least 15 points and 15 rebounds. He leads the NBA with 20 games with 20 or more points and rebounds. PLAYOFF PUSH The Pistons, who have won five of six, are eighth in the Eastern Conference's eight-team playoff standings, one-half game behind Charlotte. Casey said before the game, ""Our playoff push begins tonight.""","401071550"
"NEW YORK --  Taj Gibson didn't know when he drove by an accident back in Minnesota that Karl-Anthony Towns had been involved. Gibson greeted his teammate with a hug when he saw him in New York, relieved Towns was OK. Then Gibson helped the Timberwolves win the first time they had to play without Towns as a pro. Derrick Rose scored 20 points, Gibson added a season-high 19, and the Timberwolves overcame the first missed game of Towns' career to beat the New York Knicks 115-104 on Friday night. ""It's tough but it just shows the resiliency that this team has, the number of guys that can step up,"" Gibson said. Towns' streak of 303 consecutive starts was snapped when he was placed in the concussion protocol. Towns was able to fly to New York after the accident Thursday, but was ruled out after further medical examination Friday. The 2015 No. 1 draft pick's streak of starts was the longest to begin a career since 1970-71. He just appeared in his second straight All-Star Game and would have been playing not far from where he grew up in New Jersey had he not been hurt. Towns was at the arena, but was prevented from playing by league rules once in the concussion protocol. The Wolves' next game is Saturday at Milwaukee, and Towns would have to clear the return-to-participation steps before he can play again. In his absence, Andrew Wiggins added 17 points after missing Minnesota's two victories leading into the break with an illness, while Anthony Tolliver came off the bench for a season-high 16 points. ""Lean on whoever,"" coach Ryan Saunders said. ""Wherever the contribution comes from, we will take it."" Damyean Dotson and Allonzo Trier each scored 20 points for the Knicks in their 18th straight home loss. DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 19 rebounds, while Kevin Knox scored 18 points. Dotson made five 3-pointers and scored 18 points in the first quarter, when the Knicks also got an emphatic dunk from Dennis Smith Jr. and led 33-29. But the Wolves largely controlled the game from there, though the Knicks did trim it to single digits with about 4 minutes to play. But New York couldn't overcome its 23 turnovers that led to 20 Minnesota points. ""I don't know if it was rust or whatever, but we can't use the break as an excuse. We were just throwing the ball everywhere,"" guard Emmanual Mudiay said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: G Tyus Jones returned after missing 13 games with a sprained left ankle and had four points. ... C Gorgui Dieng was out for personal reasons. Knicks: Mudiay returned from a 12-game absence with a strained left shoulder. He had 15 points and six rebounds. ... Coach David Fizdale said injured G Frank Ntilikina (groin) was getting further evaluation Friday and the Knicks would know more about his status Saturday. STREAK SNAPPED Saunders said Towns' streak wasn't discussed when he spoke with his player Friday. Saunders said Towns' only concern was trying to be on the court to help his teammates. ""I'd just like to have him out there because he's a pretty good player,"" Saunders said . ""So the streak, I think that is something that everybody should definitely take note of with Karl's durability and his toughness and how he approaches the game, but from a coach's viewpoint you'd like to have like Karl on the floor whenever you can."" ANTHONY ANNIVERSARY It was the eighth anniversary of a trade the teams were part of, though the Wolves were a largely forgotten part of it. The Knicks' acquisition of Carmelo Anthony from Denver was actually a three-team trade involving Minnesota, which got Eddy Curry and Anthony Randolph from New York.","401071551"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Danilo Gallinari went on a scoring spree midway through the fourth quarter Friday to make sure the Los Angeles Clippers maintained their hold on the last playoff spot in the Western Conference. Gallinari scored 23 points, including 10 straight in the fourth quarter, Montrezl Harrell matched his career high with 30 points, and the Clippers beat the Memphis Grizzlies 112-106. ""I was just reading the defense, and my team needed me to be aggressive,"" Gallinari said of the scoring outburst. ""I was just trying to control the game as much as possible on the offensive and defensive end."" Lou Williams was 6 for 15 from the field and finished with 18 points, while Harrell was 11-for-14 shooting. The two reserves have become a dynamic pair for the Clippers running the pick-and-roll. Harrell said the Grizzlies' defense hedged toward Williams, taking his shot away and opening opportunities for Harrell. ""That's definitely what (the Grizzlies defense) did,"" Harrell said of Memphis concentrating on Williams. ""Every pick-and-roll we were in, whether it was the four or the five, they jumped down and showed as hard as they can. . Now, you've got me rolling down the middle of the floor and low guys trying to roll over and replace and step up for that spot."" Clippers coach Doc Rivers added: ""(Harrell) and Lou Williams had the pick-and-roll going."" The victory left the Clippers in eighth place in the West, two games up on Sacramento. Mike Conley scored 25 points and Joakim Noah had 22 as the Grizzlies lost their third straight. Avery Bradley scored 17. Memphis was within 108-104 with less than 20 seconds left when Bradley got a steal. But Noah couldn't handle the pass on the fast break, ending Grizzlies' chances. ""I think we were able to make shots, but first you have to get stops in order to get the ball to be able to make shots,"" Bradley said of the Grizzlies remaining competitive down the stretch. ""That's what we were able to do."" TIP-INS Clippers: The game marked the return of Garrett Temple and JaMychal Green, traded by the Grizzlies at the deadline for Bradley. . Harrell also scored 30 points earlier this season, on Nov. 26 at Houston. ... Los Angeles was 6 of 25 from outside the arc. Grizzlies: F Chandler Parsons, who hadn't played since the third game of the season, returned to the rotation, playing almost 20 minutes and scoring three points, hitting one of his seven shots. . Noah also had 11 rebounds, recording his third double-double of the season. ... Bradley has scored at least 15 points in three out of four games since joining Memphis. DIPLOMATIC DOC Rivers was asked before the game about Thursday night's rift between the Houston Rockets and the officials, although the question didn't specify the players or official. Rivers said there are times when a call goes against you and your first impression is someone has it out for you. ""That doesn't mean the official's doing anything wrong,"" he said. Then he added: ""Look at me, defending the officials. I'm so proud of myself right now, I don't know what to do. It's the after-the-All-Star-Break version of me."" JAREN JACKSON UPDATE Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said after the game, that rookie Jaren Jackson Jr., who sat out with right quad soreness, aggravated the injury in practice Thursday. He said the team would be cautious before he returns from the ""deep bruise."" Jackson missed a Feb. 1 game at Charlotte with the same right quad issue. ""There must have been a moment (Thursday) in practice where he re-aggravated it,"" Bickerstaff said. As for his return, the Memphis coach said Jackson could have played, but the team didn't want to risk further injury. ""At this point for him, it's not something we are willing to risk, so we'll be cautious with him,"" Bickerstaff said.","401071552"
"DALLAS --  Nikola Jokic watched a lot of shots go up and come back down in the Denver Nuggets' hands Friday night. Jokic finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds to lead a deep offensive effort, and the Nuggets broke out in the second half to beat the Dallas Mavericks 114-104. Denver won the rebound battle 63-42, cruising to its third straight victory. The Mavericks have lost three in a row, this one without star rookie Luka Doncic due to a sore right ankle. He is considered day to day. Denver outscored Dallas 39-23 in the third quarter to turn a one-point halftime lead into a 91-74 advantage. Paul Millsap had 17 points and 13 rebounds, Mason Plumlee had 12 points and 13 boards, and Isaiah Thomas had 16 points over 16 minutes in his second game since offseason hip surgery. Denver had seven players with at least 10 points. ""We had a deep bench already,"" Millsap said. ""But adding (Thomas) in the mix, I think he makes us even more deep."" The Nuggets also had three players with 13 rebounds each. Dorian Finney-Smith led Dallas with nine. ""Rebounding was the biggest problem all night,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""They have three phenomenal rebounders with Jokic, Millsap and Plumlee, and they just beat us to death there."" There were plenty of opportunities, too. Neither team shot better than 41 percent. ""We were aggressive,"" Jokic said. ""We were going to the boards because they couldn't make shots."" Jalen Brunson started in Doncic's place and had a career-high 22 points. Dwight Powell had a season-high 20. ""I loved the way (Brunson) started the game,"" Carlisle said. ""He had a rough patch. But I like the way he keeps a steady approach."" Powell gave Dallas a spark after entering midway through the first quarter. He scored eight points and grabbed three rebounds in six minutes. Powell's layup with 3:31 left gave the Mavericks a 21-20 lead. They entered the second quarter up 30-25. With Jokic in foul trouble, Millsap and Plumlee took over inside in the second quarter, which ended with the Nuggets leading 52-51. The Nuggets scored the first eight points of the second half, including 3-pointers by Barton and Beasley. Denver led by 20 points in the third quarter and 24 in the fourth. ""They just started playing a little harder,"" Brunson said. ""They turned it up a little bit, and they got a little mojo going, got a run."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic got his 40th double-double of the season. ... G Gary Harris (groin injury) returned after missing seven games, but F Trey Lyles was out after straining his left hamstring in practice Wednesday. ... Denver outrebounded Dallas 17-8 in the third quarter. ... Jokic missed his 13th triple-double of the season by two assists. Mavericks: Each team shot 41 percent from the field, but Dallas had 19 fewer attempts. Brunson was 8 for 12 (67 percent) and Powell was 6 for 12 (50). LOTS OF HELPERS By dominating the boards, Denver generated 103 field goal attempts that produced 26 fast-break points and 22 second-chance points. Coach Michael Malone also cited his team's unselfish passing. ""When you get 32 assists on 42 field goals only shooting (41) percent from the field, the ball was moving, guys were finding their teammates.""","401071553"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George cut through two defenders, lofted a shot over 7-foot-1 Rudy Gobert and waited just like everyone else. George's high-arching lob fell with less than a second remaining in double-overtime, capping a 45-point night with the winning shot in the Oklahoma City Thunder's 148-147 victory over the Utah Jazz on Friday. George dribbled out the final seconds before making his move and connecting with 0.8 seconds remaining. ""I knew I just had to step over and put it up,"" George said. ""I saw a little gap and so I put up the floater. It's a shot I work (on). Just thank God it went in."" Kyle Korver got off a desperate 3 for Utah, but it went long as the buzzer sounded. ""Tip your hat to him for making that play,"" Jazz coach Quinn Snyder said of George. ""It's a heckuva play and that's why he is who he is. He's right there in the MVP conversation. It certainly looked like that tonight."" Russell Westbrook added 43 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, helping Oklahoma City overcome 38 points from Donovan Mitchell. Westbrook fouled out with 1:09 left in the first overtime, ending his NBA streak of 11 consecutive games with a triple-double. The teams were well rested coming off an All-Star break that included an extra day off after many other teams resumed action Thursday. Oklahoma City is chasing Denver for the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference, and coach Billy Donovan was pleased with his team's effort late into the night. ""I thought our guys showed a lot of toughness in the game,"" Donovan said. ""There were different points in time, especially in regulation, where we needed to make a play and we did. Obviously with Russell and Terrance (Ferguson) fouling out, we had a lot of guys absorb minutes. The game went to overtime after the Thunder's Jerami Grant completed a tying three-point play, then blocked Mitchells shot at the other end. Grant had 18 points. In the first overtime, Abdel Nader hit a 3-pointer to give the Thunder a 139-137 lead in the final minute after Westbrook and Ferguson had fouled out. Gobert tipped in the tying basket with 33.7 seconds left, and George and Mitchell each missed jumpers in the closing seconds. Gobert hit two free throws with 1:10 left in the second overtime for a 147-146 lead, but Utah went cold from there. Mitchell's driving shot off the glass missed the rim, and Joe Ingles missed on a long 3-point try as the shot clock expired with 13.2 seconds left. Steven Adams played a game-high 47 minutes for Oklahoma City, returning from a pre-All-Star break ankle injury to score 16 points and grab 10 rebounds to go along with five steals. Derek Favors hit his first 10 shots, finishing with 24 points and 11 rebounds for Utah. Gobert had 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Jazz. The teams were physical throughout. Westbrook got a flagrant foul for crashing into Gobert while defending a layup, and there was a fracas late in the first half after Jae Crowder fouled the Thunder's Dennis Schroder. TIP-INS Jazz: It was the first time Utah had scored more than 140 points in a game in seven years and the first time they had allowed more than 140 points since 2009. Thunder: Oklahoma City scored at least 115 points for the 19th straight game, passing the Cincinnati Royals for the second longest such streak in NBA history. The Denver Nuggets hold the record with 22 straight. ... Oklahoma City swept the season series against Utah. ... The Thunder have won seven straight at home. WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME Markieff Morris received a rousing round of applause when he made his first appearance on the court for the Thunder. Morris, signed as a free agent Wednesday, checked in 3 1/2 minutes into the first quarter after Grant picked up two quick fouls, but was ineffective in his first stint. He played the rest of the quarter without taking a shot or grabbing a rebound, picking up two fouls of his own. He played 17 minutes, missed his only shot and had two assists.","401071554"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Jusuf Nurkic and Enes Kanter took advantage of Joel Embiid's absence. Nurkic scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, Kanter had 16 and eight, and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Philadelphia 76ers 130-115 on Saturday. ""It was an early game. Whoever wakes up first wins,"" Nurkic joked of the 1 p.m. start. The Sixers struggled in their second game without Embiid, the All-Star center who is expected to miss at least a week with a sore left knee. Ben Simmons had 29 points and 10 assists and Tobias Harris scored 20. ""They're not the same team without Embiid, obviously, he's a big part of what they do,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""I thought we really played well defensively."" The Blazers had a 53-33 rebounding edge, including 19 offensive boards. Damian Lillard had 17 points as seven players reached double figures. ""We just didn't rebound well enough against a team like this,"" Simmons said. ""It's a group effort rebounding. I think just all of us combined, I don't think we did enough."" Without Embiid, the Sixers couldn't keep up in a matchup between the fourth-place teams in each conference. The Blazers (36-23) have won three in a row, including a 22-point victory over Golden State before the All-Star break. Philadelphia (38-22) is 4-4 this month. ""Obviously, once you have Joel out here you slow the game down a little bit and feed him the ball, you let him do his thing,"" Simmons said. ""But it's obviously different playing without him and trying to find a flow and to not really get that."" Portland opened the second half on a 17-6 run to build a 76-62 lead. Maurice Harkless had consecutive dunks and CJ McCollum also had a dunk in that stretch. Jake Layman's dunk off an alley-oop pass from Lillard extended the lead to 99-80, and the Blazers were up 100-82 going into the fourth. The Sixers never challenged in the final quarter, scoring more than two straight points only once after they were already down 21. Portland, which won at Brooklyn on Thursday night, has five more road games before returning home to play the Thunder on March 7. ""It's a long road trip,"" Kanter said. ""We are 2-0, but I think now we just learn from it and move forward. We know we can score the ball. For us to get to the next level, we have to do it on the defensive end."" The game was back and forth in the first half until the Blazers outscored Philadelphia 16-7 over the last four minutes of the second quarter to take a 59-56 halftime lead. Nurkic had 10 of the 16. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Improved to 12-15 on the road. ... Kanter played in his second game with his team after being waived by the Knicks. ... G Evan Turner sat out because of left knee soreness.

"ATLANTA --  Taurean Prince sensed before Saturday's game that the Atlanta Hawks had learned from their mistakes in the closing seconds the night before. Trae Young and Kent Bazemore each scored 23 points, Prince added 21 and Atlanta extended the Phoenix Suns' franchise-worst losing streak to 17 games with a 120-112 victory. ""It means we're growing,"" Prince said. ""We're not letting what happened in the past affect us in the future. We put that Pistons game behind us and capitalized on the game today. I think we did a good job."" John Collins finished with 19 points and 14 rebounds for Atlanta, which snapped a two-game skid to avoid a home loss against the NBA's worst team. Just two weeks ago at State Farm Arena, the Hawks allowed the New York Knicks, last in the Eastern Conference, to snap an 18-game slide. Atlanta fell apart in the final minute Friday night against Detroit, but Bazemore liked how his team didn't fall into similarly bad habits against Phoenix. ""You look at this last bunch of games we've had, and we've been playing some good basketball,"" Bazemore said. ""We've been a play away or a rotation away or a little poor execution away from those games coming out in our favor. These have been good learning experiences."" There were 13 lead changes and three ties in the first half, but the Suns were just 1 for 1 on free throws while Atlanta was 14 of 15. The Hawks led 63-59 at the break, but Phoenix got 17 points from Tyler Johnson in the third quarter to lead by one heading into the fourth. The Suns took their biggest lead at eight on a pair of free throws by DeAndre Ayton with 5:46 remaining. Omari Spellman answered with five points on Atlanta's next two possessions, and Phoenix went without a field goal for the final 4:16. ""I thought we played really hard,"" Johnson said. ""I thought we got into our offense a lot faster than we have in the past. We were really moving. Other than that, just the lapses in judgment at the end."" Young stepped back and made a deep straightaway 3-pointer to force a 105-all tie. He hit a pair of free throws at the 2:56 mark to give Atlanta the lead for good. Johnson scored 29 points, and Devin Booker added 26 for the Suns. Ayton had 14 points and 12 rebounds.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Six days after his first All-Star appearance, D'Angelo Russell believes his confidence is at an all-time high. ""For sure, because I feel like when you have that All-Star badge, you have to be aggressive,"" Russell said. ""Teams expect it already, they game plan for you and they are trying to stop you -- and I feel like I can't be stopped."" Russell celebrated his 23rd birthday by tying a career high with 40 points, making some huge shots down the stretch to lead the Brooklyn Nets to an important 117-115 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. The victory kept the Nets alone in sixth place in the Eastern Conference and gives them 2-1 edge in the series entering Friday night's game at Brooklyn. Russell called it a ""must-win game."" The big effort came on the same floor where Russell played in the All-Star Game last Sunday night. Russell made 14 of 31 shots from the field with six 3-pointers to go along with seven assists. The Nets repeatedly turned to him to make plays, setting screens to free him up on drives and long jumpers. On several occasions, the Hornets were caught in a switch on the pick-and-roll and Russell buried jumpers over Charlotte's big men. ""We just jumped on his back,"" said Nets guard Joe Harris. ""He carried us offensively and made some huge plays."" The Hornets -- and their fans -- left the arena upset at the way the game ended. After Russell knocked down a fade-away jumper from 15 feet, and then buried a long 3-pointer from the top of the key with 39 seconds left to give the Nets the lead, the Hornets had a chance to win the game on the final possession. However, Caris LeVert blocked Kemba Walker's 3-point shot as time expired on a bang-bang play. Hornets players threw their arms up in the air looking for a call, thinking LeVert had fouled Walker as the ball bounced harmlessly to the sideline. Walker, a three-time All-Star, sat on the floor in utter disbelief at the no-call with his hands raised to the sky. The crowd booed as the officials gathered their coats and walked off the floor. ""You guys watch the film, you tell me what that was,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said in a brief news conference after the game. ""I know what I saw. I saw it live and I just saw it on film. I know what I saw, but I'll see it in a 2-minute report."" Walker refused to comment on the play, saying he didn't want to get fined by the league. ""It's over and there is nothing I can do about it at this point, so it's whatever,"" Walker said. LeVert thought he blocked the ball with his elbow, but wasn't completely sure. ""With plays like that the refs are looking at every little thing, if your hands are in the air,"" LeVert said. ""So the best thing to do is show your hands. If they call it, they call it. Like I said, I feel like it was clean."" Walker finished with 32 points, including 28 in the second half to rally the Hornets. TIP-INS Nets: Different weekend, same result for Joe Harris. Harris was 3 of 4 on 3-pointers on the same floor he won the NBA All-Star 3-point contest last weekend. Hornets: Cody Zeller fouled out with 3:24 left in the game with 13 points and 11 rebounds, a big reason the Hornets lost the late lead. ... Miles Bridges made his second straight start, but had to make an early exit after picking up two quick fouls. He had just four points. TALKING CHEMISTRY Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said he loves his team's chemistry, calling it a special group. ""They enjoy being around each other,"" Atkinson said. ""That's worth something. That sounds corny but I think it pushes you through in a tough game like this. And there's a confidence level. I think we're led by D'Angelo, whose confidence is off the charts. I think we're a much more confident team than we've been the past two seasons."" PARKER STILL HAS IT The loss overshadowed a terrific game from Hornets 36-year-old point guard Tony Parker, who had 21 points, five assists and five rebounds and provided a huge spark off the bench. Parker was instrumental in a 34-9 Hornets run that stretched from the third quarter into the fourth as the Hornets battled back from 19 down to take the lead.","401071557"
"CLEVELAND --  Kevin Love is having fun in his return to the basketball court. After a season of losing streaks, injuries and trades, the Cleveland Cavaliers finally are, too. Love scored a season-high 32 points, Cedi Osman hit the go-ahead 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter and Cleveland defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 112-107 on Saturday night. Love, playing in back-to-back games for the first time since foot surgery, had 10 points in the fourth quarter. He was 9 of 15 from the field overall, hit six 3s and made all eight of his free throw attempts. The five-time All-Star had surgery on his left foot in November and returned Feb. 8. He's averaging 16.5 points in four games since coming back. ""I feel like a big part of my life, my identity, is taken away when the game is taken away from you,"" he said. ""So I feel really good and really fortunate just to be out there."" Love had 12 rebounds in 26 minutes -- his most since returning from the injury -- but was on the bench for the final 5:23 because he's still on a minutes restriction. He lobbied coach Larry Drew to go back in, but was turned down. ""I told him with two or three minutes left I was available and he said, 'No, you're done,'"" Love said. ""It was right in the heat of everything,"" Drew explained. ""It was hard to get him out, but we knew going into the fourth quarter he had anywhere from five to six minutes to play."" The Cavaliers pulled ahead even though Love was done for the night. Osman's 3-pointer gave Cleveland a 104-103 lead with 1:58 to play. He scored on a layup following a turnover before Collin Sexton hit a 3 to put the Cavs up 109-103. ""We're really happy that we have Kevin back, but after he came out we knew we had to finish the game out,"" Osman said. Sexton had 20 points and Ante Zizic scored 18 for Cleveland, which also beat Phoenix on Thursday. The Cavaliers (14-46) won consecutive games for the third time this season. Cleveland has yet to win three in a row. Jonas Valanciunas had 25 points 11 rebounds for Memphis, which has lost four straight and 16 of 20. Mike Conley scored 18 and Joakim Noah 16. Valanciunas arrived from Toronto, which has the NBA's second-best record, at the trade deadline. ""Losing stinks,"" he said. ""We're trying to learn how to win games. Stats are stats. We don't look at the stats. We look at the results."" The Grizzlies, who lost at home to the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, were on the second part of a back-to-back. Love hit three 3-pointers and a technical foul shot early in the third quarter to help the Cavaliers build a double-digit lead. Memphis trailed 79-64 but outscored Cleveland 20-3 over the last seven minutes of the third. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff was hit with a technical foul early in the third. Noah, a constant target of boos by Cavaliers fans, received sarcastic cheers when he picked up a technical in the second. Bickerstaff left the postgame interview room without taking questions. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Valanciunas returned after not playing Friday because of personal reasons. He has appeared in three games since being acquired from Toronto on Feb. 7 and made his first start Saturday. ... F Chandler Parsons scored four points in 18 minutes. He returned Friday for the first time since the third game of the season. Cavaliers: Osman finished with 11 points. ... Cleveland dominated the first quarter, holding a 21-5 rebounding edge and making all nine of its free throw attempts. ... Cleveland led 44-26 early in the second. STILL SIDELINED Drew isn't sure when forward Tristan Thompson, who missed his 15th straight game because of a sore left foot, will return. ""It's still going slow,"" Drew said. ""We're going to take it very slowly as far as bringing him back."" BAD TIMING Bickerstaff knows his team must adjust without rookie guard Jaren Jackson Jr., out indefinitely with a bruised right thigh. ""It's tough, obviously,"" Bickerstaff said before the game. ""We were beginning to feature him more in fourth quarters.""","401071558"
"WASHINGTON --  Hardened by the loss of their best player, the Pacers keep doing whatever it takes to win. Saturday night, that meant overcoming their own mistakes and two late Wizards rallies. Thaddeus Young scored 22 points on 9-of-11 shooting, Bojan Bogdanovic added 18 and Indiana held on for a 119-112 victory. Domantas Sabonis added 13 points and 12 rebounds, while Darren Collison scored 11 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter to help the Pacers sweep a second straight back-to-back set despite 23 turnovers. ""Winning the game by any means necessary,"" Collison said. ""It felt like I set my teammates up the first three quarters. I felt like at some point I had to put my head down to be an option in the offense, and that's what happened."" Indiana sits third in the Eastern Conference after winning eight of nine. The Pacers previously dropped four in a row following the loss of All-Star guard Victor Oladipo for the season with a ruptured tendon in his right knee. ""It's not so much about playing without Vic, we're just playing our games,"" Collison said. ""Vic goes down for the season a month ago, so I think we've been finding ourselves."" Bradley Beal scored 35 points for the Wizards, a night after posting a season-high 46 at Charlotte. He converted an exceptional four-point play that brought Washington within two midway through the fourth quarter. Thomas Bryant added 23 points and 12 rebounds after being dropped from the starting lineup. But with their 22 turnovers adding to continuing defensive struggles, the 11th-place Wizards dropped their fourth straight and sit 4  1/2 games behind eighth-place Charlotte. Washington lost star point guard John Wall to a season-ending heel injury in December, and dealt starter Otto Porter Jr. at the trade deadline. Beal still believes a playoff run is possible. ""For sure,"" Beal said. ""Scoring is not the problem. It's not our problem. It's just defending and getting stops, and controlling stuff we can control."" After overcoming an early 20-point deficit at home Friday against New Orleans, the Pacers shot nearly 62 percent (29 of 47) in the first half and led by as many as 17 in the second quarter. Washington chipped at the lead and then made a 13-2 run in the fourth. Beal pulled the Wizards within 99-97 when he crossed over his dribble, hit a 3 from the right wing, absorbed a bump from Wesley Matthews and sank a foul shot with 5:55 left. Collison answered with a baseline 3 and then a pull-up jumper a possession later to quell the threat. Washington mounted one last 10-2 charge inside the final 90 seconds, with Bryant's 3-pointer closing it to 115-112 with 28 seconds left. After another Indiana turnover, Bryant missed another 3 attempt, and Collison hit two free throws. ""You could easily give in to that game,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""But our guys made plays, got stops, made free throws when they needed to."" AHEAD OF SCHEDULE? Indiana (40-20) hit the 40-win benchmark 19 days earlier than last year with Oladipo healthy. ""Forty is not the number that we want,"" McMillan said. ""We can't be satisfied with anything we've done."" LEAKY D The Wizards have now allowed at least 119 in eight of their last nine games (seven losses), despite continued efforts to fix their defensive woes. ""The only way you can do it is by doing it on the floor,"" Beal said. ""I don't know how else to really put it."" TIP-INS Pacers: Young made his first eight shots before missing a jumper with 7:11 remaining in the third quarter. ... F/C Myles Turner missed his second consecutive game with a hip injury and is day-to-day, McMillan said. ... Sabonis recorded his 24th double-double, and 21st coming off the bench. Wizards: In place of Bryant, F Bobby Portis made his first start since joining the Wizards in the trade that sent Porter to the Bulls, and his seventh this season. ... It was Bryant's eighth double-double.","401071559"
"NEW ORLEANS --  The boos showering the court when LeBron James handled the basketball left little doubt that fans in New Orleans suspect the Lakers star had something to do with why the Pelicans are cutting playing time for healthy All-Star Anthony Davis -- and sitting him out entirely when possible. James, however, was far more concerned about the performance of his own teammates. Jrue Holiday hit five 3-pointers and scored 27 points while Davis watched from the bench in street clothes, and the Pelicans beat the Lakers 128-115 on Saturday night to stunt Los Angeles' playoff push. ""That urgency has to be there and we dug ourselves a hole,"" said James, whose Lakers are 3 1/2 games out of a playoff spot in the Western Conference. ""It's how you approach the game every day, how you think the game every day. It's how you play the game, prepare for the game. It's not even like when you get to the arena. It's like way before that,"" James added. ""It's the most important thing in your life at this time."" Brandon Ingram scored 29 points for Los Angeles, but the Lakers struggled throughout to keep pace with the Pelicans, who led most of the game and by as many as 20 points. Former Laker Julius Randle had 24 points for the Pelicans. ""It's not personal because there are players and coaches over there that I have a great relationship with, but to get a win against old teammates is always cool,"" Randle said. "" James was greeted by a mixture of cheers and boos by a crowd that included a conspicuous number of fans wearing Lakers purple and gold. Pelicans fans, meanwhile, made James the object of their ire as they vented displeasure over Davis' decision to ask for a trade in late January, less than six months after Davis fired his previous representation and signed with James' agent, Rich Paul. James has denied having any influence over Davis' decision to ask out of New Orleans, which would represent a violation of the NBA's tampering rules. The Pelicans had the flexibility to sit a healthy Davis against the Lakers because New Orleans was playing for the second time in two nights, was at home and not on national television. ""If you're looking along the lines of having any significance because we're playing the Lakers, that had nothing to do with it,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said before the game. ""If we were playing the Baltimore Claws, we would sit him out that game too, OK? ""It gives us an opportunity to minimize the minutes that he's going to be playing and as a team we think that's best for our franchise right now."" The Lakers aggressively tried to acquire Davis before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. New Orleans, however, was uninterested in dealing Davis before this offseason, when more teams, including Boston, are expected to be in position to make stronger trade offers. While Davis spent the game on the bench wearing a dark suit, the players in uniform for New Orleans lit up the scoreboard and filled the stat sheet against a Lakers team needing a strong finish to the regular season to make the playoffs. ""The theme is similar to what we talk about all of the time: it's turnovers, it's making free throws, and it's being the aggressor on defense,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""When we struggle, those are kind of a common theme throughout."" TIP-INS Lakers: Committed 23 turnovers, leading to 23 Pelicans points. ... Shot 54.3 percent (44 of 81), including 10 of 29 (34.5 percent) from 3-point range. ... Kyle Kuzma scored 16 points and JaVale McGee had 10. Pelicans: Shot 52.1 percent (50 of 96), including 15 of 40 from 3-point range. .. Elfrid Payton scored 14, one night after he scored 15 in his return from a right ankle sprain that sidelined him nine games. BENCH PRODUCTION Pelicans reserve forward Cheick Diallo, now in his third season out of Kansas, had one of the better games of his career. He was perfect on eight shots from the field and tied a season high with 18 points. He also grabbed 10 rebounds and twice blocked Ingram near the rim. Guard Ian Clark added 17 points as Pelicans reserves outscored Lakers reserves 42-24. ""Those two guys were great,"" Gentry said. ""It was one of those total team wins.""","401071560"
"MIAMI --  If there's been an area of concern for Detroit coach Dwane Casey in this playoff push, it's been the play of the Pistons' second unit. The concern was unfounded Saturday. Ish Smith scored 22 points off the bench, fellow backup Langston Galloway added 15 points in the first five minutes of the fourth quarter to almost single-handedly turn a close game into a rout and the Pistons moved into seventh place in the Eastern Conference by downing the Miami Heat 119-96. Detroit's bench outscored Miami's 66-35. ""Guys responded,"" Casey said. ""Now it's the consistency part. We are on a journey. We can't relax."" Blake Griffin had 20 points while Galloway and Luke Kennard each scored 17 for the Pistons (28-30), who are 1 1/2 games behind Brooklyn for the No. 6 spot. Reggie Jackson added 13 points and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 14 rebounds for Detroit, which started the fourth quarter on a 25-8 run. Galloway was the catalyst of all that, hitting four 3-pointers in the opening minutes. He had scored a total of 28 points in February before his dazzling fourth-quarter spurt put the game away for the Pistons. ""That's what they're supposed to do,"" Casey said of Detroit's bench. ""They did the job and that's all you ask."" Josh Richardson scored 22 for Miami, which is 0-5 at home and 5-12 overall since Jan. 12. Dion Waiters scored 17, Dwyane Wade added 15 and Hassan Whiteside had 13 points and 15 rebounds for the Heat (26-32), who fell to 10th in the East. ""It's tough to explain,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It is one game and we're just going to keep plugging away, as painful as it is."" Miami got point guard Goran Dragic on the floor for the first time since Dec. 10, after a two-month rehab to recover from right knee surgery. The rest of the Heat injury news was bad. Miami was without Justise Winslow -- who has been the starting point guard in Dragic's absence -- because of a sore left knee, and James Johnson also missed the game while dealing with a sprained left shoulder. If that wasn't enough, the Heat then lost starting forward Rodney McGruder in the first half with a bruised right knee and said his status would be evaluated further on Sunday. Dragic came off the bench and finished with four points in 16 minutes. Duncan Robinson, who didn't play in the first half, started in McGruder's spot to open the third quarter. The Heat were up 29-18 late in the first quarter, after making 13 of their first 23 shots. The rest of the night was all Detroit. The Pistons outscored Miami 46-20 over the next 15 minutes, and never lost the lead again. Miami got within five in the third, but found itself down by as many as 26 in the fourth. ""They got momentum, they got confidence and they started making shots,"" Dragic said. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit, which went 6-10 in January, is 6-2 so far in February. ... The Pistons are exactly 28-30 after 58 games for the third consecutive year. They were 29-29 at this point in 2015-16. ... University of Miami coach Jim Larranaga and assistant Chris Caputo were at the game to watch Pistons rookie Bruce Brown, who played for the Hurricanes. Brown had two points. Heat: It was Miami's first home game in three weeks. Saturday started a run where the Heat play 10 times at home in a 12-game stretch. ... Miami was 7 for 28 from 3-point range, and was outrebounded 41-33. ELLINGTON RETURNS Former Heat guard Wayne Ellington, traded earlier this month to Phoenix and then waived to sign with Detroit, returned to Miami as an opponent for the first time since the moves. Ellington spent a good part of his pregame warmup greeting former teammates, coaches and Heat officials. He had six points. SECOND SWING Detroit outscored Miami 34-17 in the second quarter -- the biggest margin for the Pistons in a second quarter all season. It was the fifth time that Miami has been outscored by at least 15 points in that period this season.","401071561"
"CHICAGO --  The last time they played Boston, the Chicago Bulls walked off the court with the most lopsided loss in franchise history and little signs of hope. Consider this quite a change. Zach LaVine scored a career-high 42 points, Lauri Markkanen finished with a personal-best 35 points and 15 rebounds, and the Bulls got some payback with a 126-116 victory over the Celtics on Saturday night. ""That's in the past, a couple of months ago,"" Markkanen said. ""We had it in the back of our minds. We didn't talk about it too much. The coaches didn't say anything about it."" LaVine and Markkanen became the first Chicago teammates to score 35 or more in the same game since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen each had 37 points at Phoenix on Nov. 20, 1996. LaVine surpassed his previous high of 41 at New York on Nov. 5. Markkanen, whose best coming in was 33 against the Knicks last season, became the fourth Chicago player in 10 years to score 20 or more in eight straight games. And the Bulls won their season-high third in a row while returning the favor for a 133-77 beating at the United Center in December that was also the biggest romp in the Celtics' storied history. Kyrie Irving led Boston with 37 points and 10 assists. Al Horford scored 19, but the Celtics lost for the fourth time in six games. ""You're going to have clunkers in the NBA,"" coach Brad Stevens said. This was one. But Irving isn't concerned the Celtics' struggles will carry into the playoffs. ""No,"" he said. Why not? ""Because I'm here,"" Irving said. PULLING AHEAD The Bulls went on an 18-3 run to start the second quarter, wiping out a five-point deficit, and got up by as much as 15 in the first half before taking a 64-51 lead to the locker room. They scored eight straight early in the third to go up 72-53, Robin Lopez's hook and floater capping that spurt. Markkanen's 3 made it 87-62 with 6:25 left in the period, and the Bulls withstood a push down the stretch. Irving hit a 3 to cut it to 94-86 early in the fourth. But Markkanen answered with one of his own, then drove for a three-point play to make it a 14-point game with 9:28 remaining. LOOKING BACK It was a big change from the previous meeting, when Chicago's starters got benched for about the final 20 minutes in what was Jim Boylen's third game as coach after replacing the fired Fred Hoiberg. Some players raised the possibility of boycotting practice the following day. Instead, they held a players-only meeting and another with coaches and management. ""I think it brought us together as a team because there were things that were said that maybe you didn't want to hear -- both sides, coaches and players,"" LaVine said. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens had positive reviews for Northwestern's renovated Welsh-Ryan Arena, after the Celtics practiced there on Friday. ""I've always thought it's fun to go to different places and sometimes it's an opportunity to see something new, be in a new gym. With (Northwestern coach Chris Collins') connection with our Duke players I knew that would be fun. I know a lot of guys on that staff and have a couple friends on the football staff as well. We had an extra time to come."" Collins played at Duke and was a longtime assistant there before taking the Northwestern job in 2013. He was on Mike Krzyzewski's staff for Irving's lone season there in 2010-11. Jayson Tatum -- now in his second year -- also played at Duke. Stevens made two visits to Northwestern when he coached Butler. Bulls: Boylen had no update on F Otto Porter Jr., who sat out the second half because of a strained lower left leg. ... The Bulls outrebounded the Celtics 49-32 and made 20 of 21 foul shots. ... Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy got a standing ovation when he was shown seated along the baseline during a timeout late in the first half.","401071562"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Sacramento Kings finally got that big win they've been looking for. After two-point losses to the Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets -- the top two teams in the Western Conference -- in their previous two games, the Kings were left frustrated. Sacramento broke through against third-place Oklahoma City as Buddy Hield scored 34 points to help the Kings beat the Tunder 119-116 Saturday night. ""A game ago, it's, `Oh my gosh, we're so close,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We had the Warriors. We feel like we had the Warriors, and then they got away. So it's a little bit of relief, also."" Hield, who played college ball at the nearby University of Oklahoma, shot 12 for 22 from the field. He said holding on for the win was a big deal because of Oklahoma City's Paul George and Russell Westbrook. ""It's big, especially the way Russ and PG are playing,"" Hield said. ""They're playing great. They're a great team, great defensive team, and we came out to be resilient."" George, who hit the game-winner the night before in a 148-147 double-overtime win over Utah, missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer against the Kings that could have forced overtime. He scored 14 points and shot just 4 for 19 after entering the night averaging a league-best 38.9 points per game in February. ""PG got a good look at the end, and thank God it didn't go down,"" Hield said. Westbrook had 41 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder in his third straight game with at least 40 points. De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley each added 19 points for the Kings. Hield scored 18 points in the first half to help the Kings take a 63-49 lead at the break, but back-to-back 3-pointers by Terrance Ferguson and George cut Sacramento's lead to 67-64. Back-to-back 3s by Yogi Ferrell and Hield put Sacramento up 90-74 in the third quarter. Oklahoma City stormed back in the fourth, and Westbrook's 3-pointer with about a minute to play tied the score at 116. Fox made two free throws with 29.3 seconds left to put Sacramento up 118-116. Westbrook came back with a shot that appeared to tie the score, but he was called for an offensive foul after Willie Cauley-Stein took a charge with 11.5 seconds remaining. ""It was a charge,"" Westbrook said. ""They called a charge. That's it. I can't change the call. It's over with now."" The Kings broke through Oklahoma City's pressure, and Harrison Barnes was fouled with 4.2 seconds left. He made the second of two free throws to give the Kings a 119-116 edge, setting up the final sequence. The Kings shot 46 percent for the night. ""For the most part, we made them shoot some tough ones, and they made them,"" George said. ""It was just a night they made mid-range shots, but they've got guys who can make those plays."" TIP-INS Kings: Hield was cheered loudly during pregame introductions. He attended Oklahoma's win over Texas earlier in the day. ... Bagley hit a deep 2-point jumper at the third-quarter buzzer. Thunder: Westbrook was called for a technical in the third quarter. It was his 13th of the season, three short of the threshold for a one-game suspension. Coach Billy Donovan was called for one in the second quarter. ... Recent addition Markieff Morris debuted and played 17 minutes without scoring against Utah on Friday. He scored 10 points on 2-for-8 shooting on Saturday. HE SAID IT Hield on playing in Oklahoma: ""It's a good place to come in when you've really got to lock in in Oklahoma. Just being here, I feel comfortable."" BIG MINUTES George played 50 minutes, 26 seconds against Utah on Friday, then followed it with 38:29 of action against the Kings.

"MILWAUKEE --  Despite his team's latest win, Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer thought it was a subpar performance. Khris Middleton scored 20 of his 28 points in the second half, Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 10 rebounds, and the NBA-leading Bucks pulled away for a 140-128 victory over the short-handed Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night. The Bucks (45-14) have won 10 of 11 and 16 of 18 to move a season-high 31 games over .500. They also surpassed last season's victory total. ""Our focus, our effort, everything wasn't to our standards,"" Budenholzer said. ""I feel from start to finish (it wasn't good defense), except in the fourth quarter."" Antetokounmpo felt the same way. ""At the end of the day, we cannot just rely on our talent,"" he said. ""The past couple of games, we haven't been ourselves."" Milwaukee just slipped by Boston 98-97 on Thursday when Kyrie Irving missed a potential game-winner in the lane as time expired. ""Not every night are we going to score 140 points,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We have to play better defense. Hopefully, moving forward we can pick it up defensively."" Derrick Rose had 23 points for the Timberwolves, who played without Karl-Anthony Towns for the second consecutive game. After the score was tied at 113, the Bucks finally pulled away in the fourth quarter with a decisive 16-2 run capped by Nikola Mirotic's driving layup and two free throws from Middleton that gave Milwaukee a 129-115 advantage with 4:58 to play. Minnesota never threatened after that as the Bucks dialed up their energy and improved to 25-5 at home. ""We just ran out of gas in the fourth quarter,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Brook Lopez had 19 points for the Bucks and a technical foul for scowling at a prone Dario Saric after a dunk in the closing minutes. Taj Gibson scored a season-high 20 points for Minnesota, one better than his previous best set in Friday's night win over New York. Andrew Wiggins had 18 points and nine rebounds, and Anthony Tolliver finished with 17 points. The Timberwolves overcame the first missed game of Towns' career to beat the Knicks 115-104 on Friday, but not the second. Towns' streak of 303 consecutive starts ended when he was placed in concussion protocol after being involved in a car accident Thursday on the way to the airport. He was cleared to fly to New York, but ruled out after further medical examination Friday. He accompanied the team to Milwaukee, but was unable to play due to the league's concussion program. The 2015 No. 1 draft pick's streak of starts was the longest to begin a career since 1970-71. He just played in his second All-Star Game last weekend and is the team's leading scorer, averaging 23.1 points and 12 rebounds per game. With Towns watching in street clothes, the Timberwolves' bench came up big, outscoring the Bucks' reserves 37-20 and hustling their way to a 70-69 Minnesota lead at halftime. Tolliver, averaging 4.3 points, had 14 in the first half. Gibson and Wiggins each scored 12 and Rose had 10, including a floater in the lane that put Minnesota ahead at the break. Rose scored seven points in the third, including a three-point play at the end of the period that gave Minnesota a 109-107 lead. Middleton scored 13 straight points in the quarter to keep the Bucks close. The Timberwolves fell to 9-21 on the road. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Before the game, Towns took some initial steps toward being cleared to return. ... G Tyus Jones played in his third consecutive game after missing 13 with a sprained left ankle. Bucks: G George Hill exited with a left adductor strain in the first half and did not return. ... The last time the teams met in October, the Bucks routed the Timberwolves 125-95 for Minnesota's worst home loss since 2011. STAT LINE It was the fifth time the Bucks have scored 140 points this season, a franchise record. Milwaukee is 5-0 in those games. Prior to this season, the Bucks had scored 140 or more points four times in 30 seasons. TAKE THAT Tolliver stuffed Antetokounmpo's driving dunk attempt with 11 minutes left in the second quarter. ""It felt good,"" Tolliver said. ""I mean, he's dunked on me plenty of times in his career. Finally, I was able to get one back on him. He spun, and I jumped, and it worked out."" Antetokounmpo was shocked. ""I didn't expect that, but he's a solid defender,"" he said. ""I looked at the tape. Maybe I didn't get as high as I thought. I hope next year he's not underneath the basket because I'm going to make sure that next time, I'm going to get it done."" QUOTABLE ""We're missing him a lot,"" Wiggins said of Towns' absence. ""He's our rim protector. He challenges a lot of shots. He changes the game in a lot of different ways. We're definitely missing him.""","401071564"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Even without NBA scoring leader James Harden, the Houston Rockets took it to Golden State from the very start. Eric Gordon scored 25 points with four 3-pointers, Chris Paul converted two free throws with 1:08 left on the way to 23, and the Rockets outplayed the Warriors without the ill Harden for a 118-112 victory Saturday night. Stephen Curry's 3 with 1:57 to play pulled the Warriors to 114-108 and his two free throws at 1:26 made it a four-point game before Houston came through at the line. Kevin Durant scored 29 points and Curry added 25 with five 3s, nine rebounds and seven assists, but the Warriors had their five-game home winning streak snapped in a matchup of West powers who met in the 2018 Western Conference finals won in seven games by Golden State. ""You can come in here and win on a Monday night in February or a Tuesday night in November or December,"" Paul said. ""But in the playoffs is when you have to beat a team four out of seven times. It's great tonight that we won this but in two days y'all will forget this. We all will."" Early in the fourth, Golden State's Draymond Green exited the game with a sprained left ankle after grabbing at his foot in clear pain from stepping on teammate DeMarcus Cousins' foot. There wasn't an immediate update on Green, who Curry said ""was in good spirits after the game so I'm assuming it's not anything serious."" ""He'll be back for the playoffs. That's the only thing we worry about here, right?"" Durant said. Paul handed out 11 of his season-high 17 assists in the first half to reach 9,000 for his career, helping Houston avoid a third straight road loss. Cousins notched his third straight double-double with 13 points and a season-best 14 rebounds, while Klay Thompson had 20 points and six assists. Curry's 3 in the final 30 seconds of the first half and a jumper to beat the buzzer by Andre Iguodala got Golden State to 61-54 at halftime after the two-time defending champions trailed by 20. While Harden also has a strained neck, coach Mike D'Antoni said the reigning MVP probably could have played through that. Harden hurt the neck when he got hit during a practice leading up to Thursday's road loss to the Lakers and woke up sore the next day. ""He might've played even with a sore neck. He had a little touch of the flu. It was a combination of everything,"" D'Antoni said. In the Rockets' last visit to Oracle Arena, Harden hit a contested 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left in a 135-134 overtime win on Jan. 3 in which he finished with a triple-double and his fifth straight 40-point game. He was 13 for 32 with 10 3s. Kenneth Faried started in Harden's place and delivered 20 points and 10 rebounds. Clint Capela grabbed 15 boards. The Warriors, who held off Sacramento 125-123 on Thursday night, began 9 for 32 -- 3 of 12 on 3s -- and didn't lead for the first time until Curry's layup at the 9:54 mark of the third. Curry was 5 for 11 from deep. ""Right from the start they played harder and smarter than we did,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Much like last time, Golden State's biggest stars missed key shots when it mattered. The Warriors dug themselves an immediate hole, falling behind 15-0 before consecutive 3s by Thompson and Curry. They went 14 of 37 on 3s in last month's matchup, with Curry 5 for 15 and Durant 1 of 5. After that loss, the Warriors won 11 straight. ""As a whole our energy was just bad and our attention to detail in those first six minutes,"" Curry said. ""Yeah, we've got some stuff to work on. We know we're not playing our best even through running off a lot of wins in that last little stretch. We know who we are. We've just got to get to that point."" CP 9,000 Of his milestone, Paul called it ""an honor and a privilege."" ""When you get assists, I've got the easy part. I just pass it,"" he said. ""The other guys are the ones who have to make the shots."" TIP-INS Rockets:  Harden, who missed three games in the opening month with a strained left hamstring, is averaging an NBA-best 36.5 points. Houston is 2-2 in games without him this season after going 6-4 with him out last season. ... Houston held a 48-47 rebounding edge in the January win and 48-26 this time.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  In their first home game after the NBA All-Star break, the Utah Jazz had plenty of energy down the stretch. Utah pulled away for a 125-109 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night by taking care of the ball and picking up the pace on offense. The Jazz shot the ball efficiently and turned it over just seven times. It was a significant contrast from Friday's 148-147 double-overtime loss to Oklahoma City, when Utah committed 25 turnovers. The Thunder ultimately scored 30 points off those miscues. ""We played a good offensive game,"" Jazz guard Ricky Rubio said. ""Not as good defensive game. But our offense helped us stay in the game, take the lead, and control the tempo every time."" Rubio and Donovan Mitchell each scored 25 points to lead the Jazz. They also combined for 11 assists for the second straight game. Rubio totaled zero turnovers one night after finishing with eight. Jae Crowder contributed 22 points off the bench and Joe Ingles added 18 for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Utah didn't trail after the first quarter and took control on both ends of the court. The Jazz shot 48 percent from the field and finished with a 53-42 advantage on the glass. They played under control and consistently executed well. ""The enemy for us is mistakes,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""Turnovers is one example of that. The more mistakes we make, the more things we've got to do really well. Against the very best teams, you can't overcome mistakes."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 21 points for the Mavericks, who were without rookie Luka Doncic for a second straight game because of a sore right ankle. Trey Burke added 20 points off the bench in Dallas' fourth consecutive loss. ""Both teams were on a shortage of gas tonight,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""But ours was a little shorter than theirs, I guess."" Both teams shot nearly 60 percent in the second quarter, when Utah opened a double-digit lead. The Jazz carved out their largest lead of the first half when Mitchell nailed a 3-pointer to put Utah up 49-38 midway through the period. Dallas hung around and whittled the deficit to 59-58 on a 3-pointer from Hardaway with 29 seconds remaining in the half. Mitchell answered with a jumper at the other end to keep Utah's lead from getting completely erased. The Mavericks couldn't get any closer after enduring a miserable start to the third quarter. Dallas missed 13 of 15 shots and scored just five points over the first 7 1/2 minutes of the quarter. ""The biggest thing for us was making sure that they get one possession,"" Mitchell said. ""They were getting a lot of stuff in the paint, making the extra play. We just really locked in on them and got out in transition."" It opened the door for Utah to pull away. The Jazz ran off four straight baskets, culminating in a layup from Royce O'Neale, for a 78-63 lead with 4:40 left in the quarter. Dallas made another rally early in the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-83 on a 3 from Dirk Nowitzki. Utah got baskets on five straight possessions to maintain its lead. Ingles fueled the run with a pair of 3s, and Gobert capped it off with a finger-roll layup that put Utah up 98-86 with eight minutes remaining. ""Tonight was one of those games where we just kind of let it go at the end,"" Burke said. NOWITZKI'S FIRST START Nowitzki made his first start of the season for the Mavericks. He responded with a season-high 15 points in 25 minutes. Nowitzki also made a season-best six field goals. The veteran forward has played in just 28 games this season after sustaining a tendon injury in September. He came in averaging 4.7 points and 1.9 rebounds in 11.3 minutes per game. ""That's what I've been doing for two decades,"" Nowitzki said. ""It wasn't that new. It's a little easier to get into the game when you start. You have a rhythm right away. It's a lot easier than coming off the bench."" IRON MAN Ingles appeared in his 281st straight regular-season game. Now in his fifth season with the Jazz, Ingles has missed just four games. He has played in 383 out of a possible 387 games for Utah during that stretch. ""He wants to be out there,"" Snyder said. ""He doesn't want to be out there to break a record or earn a streak. He wants to be out there because he likes to play."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Burke scored at least 20 points for the fifth time this season. It was his first 20-point game with the Mavericks. ... Dallas committed a season-low three turnovers. ... The Mavericks finished with 50 bench points. It was the ninth time their second unit scored at least 50 points this season. Jazz: Derrick Favors grabbed 11 rebounds, his 13th game this season with 10 or more. ... Mitchell has scored at least 20 points in 20 of his last 21 games. ... Utah had a 16-9 advantage in fast-break points.","401071566"
"TORONTO --  Terrence Ross and the Orlando Magic shook off the disappointment of a difficult loss by taking down Ross' former team. Ross scored 28 points, Nikola Vucevic had 23 points and 12 rebounds and the Magic beat the Raptors 113-98 on Sunday, ending Toronto's winning streak at seven. Jonathan Isaac scored 16 points and D.J. Augustin had 12 as the Magic won for the sixth time in seven games. Orlando had won a season-best five straight before a 110-109 home loss to Chicago on Friday, its first game following the All-Star break. ""This is the part of the season where you've got to move forward, no matter what,"" Ross said of moving past Friday's narrow defeat. ""You can't let that determine how you start the next game. You've got to make sure that you're ready to play."" Ross, who played 4 1/2 seasons in Toronto, connected on nine of 21 attempts, including three of eight from 3-point range, and matched his season high with nine rebounds. He has led the Magic in scoring 11 times this season, including five of the past 10 games. ""He's been great,"" Vucevic said. ""When he scores for us like that, it just gives us a huge advantage."" Orlando made 12 of 20 field goals in the fourth quarter and led by double digits for the final nine minutes. ""I thought we played hard, with a ton of intensity, and we had good purpose of play,"" coach Steve Clifford said. Kyle Lowry had 19 points and 10 assists and Pascal Siakam had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Raptors, who lost for the first time since Jan. 31 against Milwaukee. ""Just never really got in a rhythm,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""They made some big shots every time we thought we were right where we needed to be."" Raptors forward Kawhi Leonard (rest) did not play after scoring 25 points, 19 of them in the second half, in Friday's home win over San Antonio. Nurse said Leonard will return for Tuesday's game against Eastern Conference rival Boston. Toronto is 13-4 without Leonard. ""We just didn't execute,"" Lowry said. Marc Gasol scored 16 points and Serge Ibaka had 14, extending his streak of consecutive games with at least 10 points to a career-best 22. The Magic led 53-30 at halftime and took an 80-71 lead into the final quarter. TIP-INS Magic: G Isaiah Briscoe (NBA concussion protocol) was inactive. Briscoe matched his career high with 10 points against Chicago on Friday. ... Orlando handed Toronto its biggest defeat of the season on Dec. 28, a 116-87 home victory. Raptors: Gasol made his first start for Toronto, replacing Ibaka. ... Anunoby started in place of Leonard. ... G Jodie Meeks scored 10 points in his Raptors debut. ... Toronto is 7-1 in February. FAIR AND FOUL After hitting just 13 of 24 free throws against the Bulls, the Magic were better at the foul line against Toronto. Ross connected on all seven of his attempts from the stripe and Orlando made 15 of 20 overall. UNDER 100 The Magic are 13-3 when holding their opponent to fewer than 100 points. Orlando has done it three times in its past four victories. EXCLUSIVE COMPANY The Magic are one of three Eastern Conference teams with multiple victories against Toronto this season. Milwaukee (three wins) and Boston (two) are the others. Toronto has also lost twice to Denver.","401071567"
"DENVER --  Paul Millsap wasn't about to let Nikola Jokic's foul trouble hinder the Denver Nuggets. Millsap helped the Nuggets breeze past the Los Angeles Clippers 123-96 with a vintage performance that had his coach marveling at his youthful and infectious energy Sunday. Jokic had 22 points and 16 rebounds, and Millsap had 21 points and 16 boards, doing much of his damage after Jokic took a seat two minutes into the second half with his fourth foul. Millsap said he knew he had to step up, ""not just scoring inside, but leading the team."" He said that was easier for him to accomplish thanks to a break earlier this month when he missed three games with a sore right ankle. Since his return, he said, he's in better shape and better rhythm. ""I feel great,"" Millsap said. ""Having that break was definitely beneficial."" His refreshed body and mind has, in turn, injected Denver's deep bench with even more energy. ""Paul found the fountain of youth or something,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He's playing like a young Paul Millsap. He's flying around. We chart everything, Paul Millsap by himself, he contested 18 shots tonight. Eighteen shots, 21 points, 16 rebounds and just impacting the game. His energy is infectious for all the other guys. ""And Nikola obviously, we expect that from him every night. It's a good win."" One that helped the Nuggets pull within a game of the Western Conference-leading Golden State Warriors. At 41-18, the Nuggets are also three games ahead of the third-place Oklahoma City Thunder, who visit Denver on Tuesday night. Lou Williams scored 24 and Danilo Gallinari had 19 for the Clippers, who couldn't capitalize on Denver's uncharacteristic 22 turnovers and 12 missed free throws because they were ice cold themselves. The Clippers made just 3 of 24 3-pointers. That wasn't all that went wrong for the Clippers. ""I didn't think we played very well,"" L.A. coach Doc Rivers said. ""I would love to say it was shots missed, I thought they were the tougher team, the more physical team. They got to most of the loose balls, they beat us down the floor. I thought it started on the defensive end, and then in the third quarter I thought it was our offense let us down."" It wasn't just Millsap who hurt the Clippers when Jokic went out, Rivers insisted. ""I think they all hurt us for the most part. They just kept going downhill all game. Millsap was great,"" Rivers said. ""We had a couple of good efforts overall, but I just didn't like how we played."" BIG THREE: During Denver's big third-quarter run, Mason Plumlee found himself unguarded at the top of the key and banked a 3-pointer, just his second of the season, triggering a timeout by the Clippers. Gary Harris called it the play of the game and suggested opponents might want to put a hand up when Plumlee gets the ball deep. ""I didn't hear him call `bank,"" joked Malone. Millsap said he heard ""Glass!"" At least he thinks he did. ""Um, yeah,"" Millsap said. ""I knew it was good when it left his hands."" ROOKIE HICCUPS Clippers rookie guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander came in averaging 10 points a game on 47 percent shooting from the field and 33 percent from long-range. But he scored just one point in 30 minutes, going 0 for 8 from the floor, 0 for 3 from the arc and 1 for 2 from the stripe. ""Just keep playing. No one's going to feel sorry for you. I'll hug him or whatever, but this is the NBA,"" Rivers said. ""You're going to have bad games, you just have to be willing to go 0-for and not change your body language. I thought it did tonight, Shai started pressing. He's young and he'll learn from that. If you want to be great you have to be willing to go 0 for 20 and still keep doing other things."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles missed all 12 of its 3-point attempts in the first half and was 0 for 14 by the time they finally made one -- Williams' 3 made at the 6:11 mark of the third quarter cut Denver's lead to 80-64. ... The Clippers lost the season series 3-1. Nuggets: Harris, who returned Friday after missing seven games with a right adductor strain, came off the bench and scored 14 points in 22 minutes for Denver. ... Harris' best play, however, was his deflection of Williams' pass into the paint that he subsequently spiked volleyball style downcourt for Monte Morris' breakaway basket.","401071568"
"NEW YORK --  This Broadway smash even made news on Hollywood's big night. Hey, when the Knicks win a home game, Spike Lee needs to know. Even if he's across the country at the Academy Awards, busy getting his own big victory. So when the Knicks snapped their franchise-record losing streak at Madison Square Garden at 18 games by beating the San Antonio Spurs 130-118 on Sunday night, actor Samuel L. Jackson made the announcement from on stage to Lee . Lee was in the audience on the night he won the award for best adapted screenplay for ""BlacKkKlansman,"" but for so long sat courtside when the Knicks used to win home games. ""It's major,"" guard Dennis Smith Jr said after his first home victory as a Knick. ""We've been having our fans come out and support every night and haven't won here since Dec. 1. I wasn't part of that one, so I'm glad that we could get it tonight and just give the fans something to see."" Damyean Dotson scored 27 points, and Smith, Kevin Knox and Emmanuel Mudiay all had 19. Smith had 13 assists and Knox had 10 boards, while rookie Mitchell Robinson finished with 15 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots. Coach David Fizdale said the Knicks never talked about their home skid, which began after a victory over Milwaukee. ""They get over it, they get back to work,"" he said. ""And at some point you know the basketball gods will look out for you when you're doing that."" DeMar DeRozan had 32 points and nine rebounds for the Spurs, who fell to 1-6 on their trip that ends Monday night in Brooklyn. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 18 points, but was limited to just 13 minutes through three quarters because of foul trouble. The Spurs came in as the NBA's best 3-point shooting team but were just 6 for 24 behind the arc, far too poor to make up for a dismal defensive effort that had the Knicks wearing out the rims with slam dunks and shooting 51 percent. Coach Gregg Popovich credited his reserves for getting the Spurs back into the game in the second half, but the hole was too big. ""That group gets credit for playing and doing their job the way they should,"" he said. ""Other than that, it was a pathetic performance defensively, but the Knicks had something to do with it."" The Spurs were so off early that they didn't even make one of their baskets. Knox and Smith both went for the rebound of Aldridge's miss with no Spurs around and knocked it into the basket, with Aldridge getting credit for the field goal. The Knicks led by nine at halftime and then started to run the Spurs off the floor in the third quarter. Pushing the pace and getting some easy dunks on lobs, they opened a 90-67 advantage on a 3-pointer by Dotson. The Spurs had to call three timeouts in the period -- two at the same time when they couldn't get the ball in after the first one -- and were still down 19 with just over 2 minutes left in the period. They scored the final eight to cut it to 94-83 entering the fourth, but whenever they seemed to have any momentum, they would throw the ball away, allow an offensive rebound or commit a foul to stall. ""We crawled back from 20, got back in the game, gave ourselves an opportunity,"" DeRozan said, ""but it's really hard to find positives when you're supposed to come in a building like this, against a team like this and get a win."" TIP-INS Spurs: Popovich said G Derrick White, recently returned from a heel injury, would play Monday in Brooklyn after sitting out the front end of the back-to-back. ... Jacob Poeltl had 12 points and nine rebounds. Knicks: C DeAndre Jordan sat out with a sprained left ankle. ... Fizdale said G Frank Ntilikina was progressing in his recovery from a sore groin and now able to do some running. ... Fizdale was asked if he had considered any different types of techniques to deal with the Knicks' struggles at home. ""Like incense?"" he responded. COACH ON COACH Popovich coached against Jeff Van Gundy when the Spurs beat the Knicks in the 1999 NBA Finals, and selected him to coach the U.S. team in qualifying games for this summer's Basketball World Cup, where Popovich will lead the Americans. Popovich praised the work of Van Gundy, who hasn't been an NBA coach since going 52-30 with Houston in 2006-07. ""He's better than most of us as a coach. I think most people know that, but that's not always what gets you hired,"" Popovich said. ""It's circumstances and those sorts of things and personal situations, and timing has to be right and all that. But he certainly is somebody who would make a franchise better, without any doubt."" FAMILIAR FACE David Lee sat courtside with his fiance, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. Lee played for both teams, beginning his career with the Knicks in 2005 and playing his final season with the Spurs in 2016-17.","401071569"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  DeMarcus Cousins was getting tired of Kevin Durant cussing him out. So he finally took Durant's advice. ""He's been telling me to stop thinking about it and just go play my game -- be aggressive,"" Cousins said. Cousins did just that. Klay Thompson scored 26 points, Cousins had a season-high 24 points and 11 rebounds, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-110 on Monday night. Coach Steve Kerr said it was the most comfortable Cousins has looked in a Warriors uniform. ""He made a couple of moves around the hoop where he showed great agility, but I think this is the best he's looked,"" Kerr said. Cousins was happiest that he finally eclipsed 30 minutes of playing time. ""I have to hug coach Kerr for that,"" he said. Durant knows how important Cousins' presence will be as the Warriors take aim at another NBA championship -- but equally as important for the center's confidence. ""It's huge for him to get his legs up under him and see the ball go in the rim and getting back to making the moves he normally makes,"" Durant said. ""So hopefully he builds on it."" But Cousins wasn't all smiles and jokes after the game. He remained miffed that he received a technical foul in the second half when he tossed Jeremy Lamb's shoe -- which had fallen off in the middle of a play- into the crowd. The shoe was intercepted in the front row by longtime Carolina Panthers outside linebacker Thomas Davis. ""Next time I will just step on the shoe, roll my ankle, break it, tear an Achilles, just leave it out there next time -- I guess that is what they want,"" Cousins said. Stephen Curry joked that next time Cousins should ""gently"" toss it next time, saying he's too strong. ""Well, he didn't have an insole in his shoe so it messed with the weight of the shoe and I put a little extra on it,"" Cousins said with a grin. The Warriors took a 1  1/2-game lead over the Denver Nuggets in the race for the best record in the Western Conference and erased the memory of a home loss against Houston on Saturday night. Durant had 20 points and seven rebounds for the Warriors, who have not lost back-to-back games since Dec. 27. It was an off night for Curry in his return to his hometown, finishing with 16 points on 4-of-14 shooting from 3-point range. He went 4 of 17 from beyond the arc on this court at the NBA All-Star game eight days ago. After trailing by 17 during the fourth quarter, Charlotte clawed within seven with 3:24 left before Curry stole a pass and fed Thompson for a fast-break layup. Curry sank a 3-pointer with a minute left and raised his hands to show his relief. Cody Zeller made 13 of 14 shots from the field and finished with a career-high 28 points to lead the Hornets, who have lost two straight. Zeller was largely the beneficiary of the Warriors putting added pressure on point guard Kemba Walker and not allowing him to shoot. ""The rest of us have to continue to make plays,"" Zeller said. ""All of my buckets were right around the rim, a lot of easy buckets, but a lot of credit to Kemba and Nicolas (Batum) and those guys for making the unselfish play. It's on me to continue to score myself or find shooters in the corners."" TIP-INS Warriors: Had eight dunks in the second quarter. Hornets: Were 3 of 14 from 3-point range in the first half. ... Walker became the franchise's career leader in field goals made with 3,952, passing Dell Curry. CURRY'S TOUR During his stop in Charlotte, Curry hosted the ""Underrated Tour,"" a first-of-its-kind series of basketball camps designed to highlight underrated prep athletes looking to make it to the next level. The camp is free and available to unsigned high school players with a 3-star ranking or below -- like Curry had in high school -- giving overlooked athletes the opportunity to refine their skills, gain exposure and achieve a deeper understanding of the game. About 100 players participated in the event at the new Curry Court, an indoor court that he helped renovate at a downtown recreation center. Curry is hosting the same event at seven cities around the country. BIG ON ASSISTS The Warriors passing was outstanding at times and they finished with 35 assists. ""We did a good job of exploiting the mismatches and letting the offense work for us,"" Durant said.","401071570"
"CLEVELAND --  CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard made sure Portland didn't turn an easy win into a crushing loss. McCollum scored 35 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter, and Lillard hit two crucial 3-pointers down the stretch as the Trail Blazers hung on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 123-110 on Monday night. The Blazers led 71-48 at halftime, but needed a 14-0 run late in the fourth quarter to finally put away a game that looked like a rout in the first half. McCollum finished the night hitting 12 of 18 shots, including 7 of 8 3-pointers. Lillard scored eight of his 21 points in the final period. McCollum, a native of Canton, Ohio, played in front of a large contingent of family and friends. ""I had about 60-100 people here,"" he said. ""They spent a lot of money on tickets and drove in for the game, so I figured I had to give them something tonight."" ""CJ carried us on the offensive end,"" Lillard said. ""We tried to just keep that rolling because it seemed like he was making every shot. When a scorer gets in that rhythm, it's important not to cool him off."" Cleveland cut the lead to 88-84 going into the fourth and was behind 105-102 with 4:42 left, but Portland's backcourt duo took over from there. Cleveland coach Larry Drew was asked about the pair before the game. His words turned out to be hauntingly accurate for the Cavaliers. ""They can change a game,"" he said. ""They can make big shots. Either guy can have not a big night, but a huge night. They're going to score. They're just that good."" Cedi Osman scored 27 points for the Cavaliers, who were attempting to win three straight for the first time this season. Kevin Love, playing his fifth game since returning from foot surgery, had 18 points and 12 rebounds in 28 minutes. The Blazers, coming off road wins over playoff contenders Brooklyn and Philadelphia, seemed to be on their way to a comfortable win against the Cavaliers, who have the league's third-worst record. Portland scored the game's first 14 points and continued to pour it on in the second quarter. Cleveland rallied in the third, and Matthew Dellavedova's 3-pointer with a second left cut the lead to 88-84. ""We were saying how it didn't feel like a double-digit loss,"" Love said. ""It just got away from us a little bit there at the end."" Cleveland appeared to tie the game early in the fourth, but Larry Nance Jr.'s 3-pointer was waved off after the Blazers were charged with a common foul on a screen set by Dellavedova. Seth Curry hit all five 3-point attempts and finished with 15 points for Portland, which is in fourth place in the Western Conference.

""In the second half we took for granted all of the things we were doing to get out front."" ""Obviously the first half was fun to watch,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""In the second half they played harder than us. But I like the way we finished.""

"DETROIT --  Detroit coach Dwane Casey downplayed the revenge factor after the Pistons beat Indiana. ""This is the way that we have to play, no matter who we play,"" Casey said. Andre Drummond had 26 points and 16 rebounds, Blake Griffin had a triple-double and the resurgent Pistons won for the seventh time in eight games, beating the Pacers 113-109 on Monday night. Indiana won the previous meeting with Detroit, 125-88 on Dec. 28 -- a blowout that was hard for the Pistons to forget. ""It left a bad taste in our mouth the last time we played these guys. They outworked us pretty much in all facets of the game,"" Griffin said. ""We wanted to come out and impose our will in a lot of different ways."" Griffin had 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for Detroit, which is battling for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference -- and right now is on the right side of that cutoff. Indiana lost for only the second time in 10 games. Pacers center Myles Turner returned after missing two games with a bruised left hip. He scored seven points. Domantas Sabonis scored 23 for Indiana, but he left with a sprained ankle with just over a minute remaining. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 25 points. Detroit raced out to a 17-point lead in the first quarter. Indiana trimmed the deficit to four by halftime and tied the game at 75 in the third quarter. Detroit answered with nine straight points, including six by Drummond . The Pistons later went on a 13-2 run in the fourth, taking a 100-86 lead on a 3-pointer by Langston Galloway. Detroit held on at the end in what became an increasingly contentious game. ""This is the type of basketball that we're going to see for the rest of the season,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""Tonight you've got a team that's holding down the seventh spot trying to play themselves into the playoffs just as we are. You're going to see this type of game and you've got to expect that. I thought we kind of lost our composure."" STANDINGS The Pacers are in solid playoff position with the third-best record in the East. The Pistons remain in seventh but increased their lead to 1 1/2 games over Charlotte and two games over Orlando. CHIPPY McMillan was called for a technical foul in the third, and Bogdanovic and Griffin were hit with a double technical with 3:43 to play in the fourth. Thaddeus Young flagrantly fouled Drummond with 1:57 to go, and then Young and Drummond were given a double technical 25 seconds later. ""We've got to keep our head. The only way they were going to get back in that game was to get us discombobulated, and get us upset and out of sorts, and they did,"" Casey said. ""Nobody backed down, and that's the way you have to play, with that chip on your shoulder. But with that said, we've got to have an understanding of what they're trying to do. They're trying to just junk it up, mess it up, mess you up, and they did."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana is now 14-10 without guard Victor Oladipo this season. He ruptured a quad tendon in his right knee Jan. 23 and is out for the season. Pistons: Luke Kennard scored 19 points. He and Griffin made five 3-pointers apiece.","401071572"
"NEW YORK --  Worst scoring performance of the season. Worst rodeo road trip of any season. The San Antonio Spurs have rarely looked this shaky so close to the playoffs. D'Angelo Russell had 23 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and the Brooklyn Nets beat the slumping Spurs 101-85 on Monday night. A night after their defense was absent in a loss to the Knicks, the Spurs went across town and couldn't get their offense going. San Antonio was held to its lowest point total of the season, and the NBA's leading 3-point shooting team was a season-worst 16.7 percent behind the arc. Unable to get a win, the Spurs had to settle for a positive. ""I was very angry after the game last night. I'm very pleased about this game because we held a good team to 101 points and if we continue to do that we'll be in good shape,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Just, you can't control whether the ball goes in or not, so I think it was a good night for us."" San Antonio came in shooting a little better than 40 percent on 3s but finished 4 for 24. ""We gave them different looks in the pick-and-roll defense but it was key shutting down their 3-point shooters,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. That sent the Spurs to a third straight loss and a 1-7 finish on their annual road trip that began in 2003 when the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo takes over their arena. Joe Harris and Caris LeVert each added 15 points for the Nets, who made 19 3-pointers. LaMarcus Aldridge had 26 points and 10 rebounds, and DeMar DeRozan added 23 points for the Spurs. The Spurs have made 21 consecutive playoff appearances, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history. But they entered tied with the Clippers for the final two playoff spots in the Western Conference, just ahead of ninth-place Sacramento, heading into their final 20 games. ""You have to stay confident, got to believe in yourself that hard work is going to make it better. Got to believe that shots are going to fall. Got to believe that if you put effort into defense and into doing the schemes that it'll work,"" Aldridge said. ""Like I said, going home doesn't guarantee wins, but hopefully it'll put some new life into us and try to get some wins."" San Antonio gave up at least 30 points in every quarter Sunday in its 130-118 loss as New York snapped its franchise-worst home losing streak at 18 games. The Spurs then surrendered 28 in the first quarter in Brooklyn, falling behind by eight. The Spurs tightened up in the second but this time couldn't get their own offense going, missing all six 3-point attempts in the period and getting outscored 15-4 to end the half as Brooklyn opened a 52-38 advantage. It grew to 72-51 when Russell hit a 3-pointer just in front of the Spurs bench that seemed much deeper than the 26 feet it was credited as. ""When he's got it rolling like that you want him to continue to just be aggressive, to play with that confidence,"" Harris said. TIP-INS Spurs: Rudy Gay had 13 points. ... The Spurs' previous worst was 86 points at Memphis on Jan. 9. ... San Antonio had won the last seven meetings. Nets: The Nets beat the Spurs for the first time since Dec. 3, 2014. Their longest skid against a West team is now seven in a row against Golden State. ... St. John's coach and Hall of Famer Chris Mullin, who is from Brooklyn, was at the game. HOPE AT HOME It was the start of an important week for the Nets, who host Washington on Wednesday and Charlotte on Friday before a road-heavy March that includes a seven-game trip that will have them away for more than two weeks. ""I think it's an advantage playing here,"" Atkinson said. ""I think we have to make some money, especially knowing what comes after that.""","401071573"
"MIAMI -- Devin Booker came into his final matchup against Dwyane Wade looking to be the next player on the list of those who have snared a retirement-season jersey from the Miami star. Turns out, the jersey wasn't even the biggest prize. Booker scored 20 points, Phoenix played a nearly flawless fourth quarter and the Suns snapped their club-record 17-game losing streak by topping the reeling Heat 124-121 on Monday night. The Suns shot 78 percent in the final period, and scored 72 points after halftime to stun a Heat team that dropped its sixth straight home game. ""It feels like we're out,"" Booker said. ""It feels like we were in prison."" Deandre Ayton offered an even more-succinct analysis: ""Hallelujah,"" said the Suns' rookie and No. 1 pick in last year's draft. Former Heat guard Tyler Johnson scored 18 points for Phoenix, which hadn't won since Jan. 12. Jamal Crawford and Kelly Oubre Jr. each had 16 and were huge down the stretch for Phoenix, while Ayton and Troy Daniels each had 14 and Josh Jackson scored 11 for the Suns. Hassan Whiteside scored 29 points and Kelly Olynyk added 28 for the Heat, who have dropped six straight at home for the second time this season. Missing four often-starters or regular rotation players, Miami went largely with an eight-man rotation and could barely get any stops in the final quarter. ""It went back and forth until we ran out of time,"" said Wade, who scored 13. ""It's obviously unfortunate. This game hurts."" Phoenix improved to 2-42 this season when trailing after three quarters, and snapped a 42-game losing streak in road games when trailing entering the final period. ""We played desperate, we played with a sense of urgency and we came here not just to play -- we came to win a game,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""And I'm glad we did."" After the Booker free throws, the next Miami possession saw Wade miss a turnaround jumper even after getting a good look over the 7-foot Ayton. Bam Adebayo had a chance at the tip-in, couldn't get it to fall, and Oubre went to the line with 2.1 seconds left. He made both, Miami had no time-out left to call, and Wade's desperation 55-footer wasn't close. ""Ball didn't go in the hole, bruh,"" Adebayo said of the missed tip. ""Not going to sleep over that one tonight."" Johnson got the return to Miami he wanted -- a win against his former club. Now, he can resume rooting for the Heat, even after he helped deal their quest for an Eastern Conference playoff berth a serious blow. ""These are my guys,"" said Johnson, who was traded earlier this month. ""Obviously, I want to see them be successful. I would never wish for anything negative on their careers. Luckily I'm in the opposite conference, so it is a little bit easier to cheer for them. I hope they figure it out. I know they will."" TIP-INS Suns: Amid all the losing, it's perhaps difficult to remember that Phoenix has beaten Milwaukee, Denver, Boston and San Antonio this season. ... The Suns shot 51 percent for the game and 62 percent in the second half. Heat: This is now the second season in franchise history with multiple home losing streaks of six or more games. The 2007-08 Heat had a six-game and two seven-game home slides. ... Miami lost despite scoring 70 points in the paint. ... The Heat were without James Johnson (shoulder), Rodney McGruder (knee), Justise Winslow (knee) and Derrick Jones Jr. (flu). MISERY HAS COMPANY Phoenix avoided joining New York as the second team to have an 18-game losing streak this season. This would have been the first NBA season since 1981-82 in which multiple franchises have lost at least 18 consecutive games; that season, Utah (18), Cleveland (19) and the San Diego Clippers (19) endured such a streak. WADE VS. SUNS Wade played against the Suns for the 23rd and final time. The Heat were 17-5 with him against Phoenix, and Chicago went 1-1 against the Suns in Wade's one season as a member of the Bulls. He averaged 22.9 points in the 23 games against the Suns.","401071574"
"CHICAGO --  Giannis Antetokounmpo spent most of the game standing on the sideline and cheering just about every play, big and small. That was all he could do for the NBA-leading Bucks. Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon each scored 22 points, and Milwaukee beat the Chicago Bulls 117-106 Monday night without Antetokounmpo. While the All-Star forward sat out with a sore right knee, the Bucks overcame a sluggish start to pick up their 17th win in 19 games. ""We have one of the best players in the NBA,"" Brogdon said. ""But when he's out, we still have a really good team."" The Bucks used a huge second quarter to grab a nine-point lead after falling behind by 14. That propelled them to their eighth straight road win -- their best streak since a nine-game run during the 1981-82 season. Brogdon hit 4 of 7 3-pointers. Middleton nailed 3 of 5 from beyond the arc. Nikola Mirotic scored 13 in his first game in Chicago since the Bulls traded him to New Orleans last season. And the Bucks moved a season-high 32 games over .500. ""Would not surprise me in the least,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said about the possibility of Milwaukee winning the NBA championship. Lauri Markkanen and Robin Lopez each scored 26 for Chicago. But the Bulls' season-high three-game win streak came to an end. It was the ninth straight 20-point game for Markkanen, who scored a career-best 35 against Boston on Saturday. Lopez had his highest scoring game of the season. But coming off a career-best 42-point performance, Zach LaVine finished with 11. He scored just one point after the first quarter, though he did have nine assists and eight rebounds in the game. TAKING CONTROL The Bucks trailed by 14 late in the first quarter, only to outscore Chicago 38-16 in the second to grab a 63-54 halftime lead. Brogdon had nine points in a 16-2 run to start the period as Milwaukee erased a 13-point deficit. Middleton scored 12 over the final 4:07, including a step-back 3 in the closing seconds to send Milwaukee to the locker room up by nine. And the Bucks never really were threatened after that. ""I just thought we weren't organized (in the second quarter),"" Boylen said. ""I just thought we made some poor decisions. I called a timeout and drew a baseline out-of-bounds and we ran it poorly. Can't do that. I can't use my timeout and draw something up that's worked for us before and you come out and don't execute it. That's unacceptable here. And it aggravates me."" TIP-INS Bucks: Coach Mike Budenholzer said Antetokounmpo worked out Monday and the Bucks are ""hopeful"" his absence is ""very short term."" Antetokounmpo is averaging 27.2 points and 12.7 rebounds per game, putting him among the league's top 10 in both categories. ... The Bucks were also missing guards George Hill (strained left groin) and Sterling Brown (right wrist). Budenholzer said Hill likely will be out at least a few games. ... Milwaukee signed G Isaiah Canaan to a 10-day contract and recalled F Christian Wood from the G League's Wisconsin Herd. ... The Bucks completed a four-game sweep against Chicago this season. Bulls: G Kris Dunn (migraine) and F Otto Porter Jr. (strained lower left leg) missed the game. Boylen said he thinks Porter ""will for sure"" travel with the team to Memphis on Tuesday, though he was less certain about Dunn. ... The Bulls are scheduled to visit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis on Tuesday.","401071575"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden isn't exactly lamenting the end of his impressive scoring run. Harden had 28 points, snapping his 32-game streak with at least 30 while the Houston Rockets beat the Atlanta Hawks 119-111 on Monday night. He's glad it's over, too -- especially since he had no expectation of matching Wilt Chamberlain's 65-game streak, the longest in NBA history. Harden's stretch with 30 or more points ranks second. ""Yeah I am. It was cool but I knew I wasn't going to get to No. 1,"" Harden said before walking away chuckling. Houston overcame a scoring outburst from Hawks rookie Trae Young, who set career highs with eight 3-pointers and 36 points. Harden returned after missing Saturday's win over Golden State with a neck injury and missed all 10 3-pointers he attempted. ""This was the first time I was able to move it since a few days,"" he said. ""So it kind of felt good to go out there and just move it and run around. I hadn't really done any movement or working out. I've been in bed really."" He got to 28 points with 23.3 seconds left and had the ball on Houston's last possession but did not attempt a shot from half court with the game in hand. When asked if the injury affected his shot he said: ""I don't care. Made shots, missed shots, we won the game."" Harden last came up short of 30 points in a Dec. 11 win over Portland, when he had 29. During the streak, he scored 50 or more points four times, including a career-high 61 in a win at the Knicks on Jan. 23. ""Eventually it was going to have to end one of these days,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""He's unbelievable. He'll start another one."" Chris Paul added 20 points, and Eric Gordon hit four 3-pointers for 16 points. The Hawks cut the lead to five on a basket by John Collins with about 2 1/2 minutes remaining. Harden missed his 10th 3-pointer seconds after that, but Harden was fouled on a 3-pointer on the next possession and made all of the free throws to make it 115-107. Atlanta scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter, with five points including a long 3-pointer from Young, to cut the lead to one. P.J. Tucker got the Rockets going again when he made a 3-pointer to make it 98-94 with 8 1/2 minutes remaining. Young's hot shooting continued after that when he made his seventh 3 to cut the lead to one again. Harden made four quick points later in the quarter, but Young was at it again after that, sinking his eighth 3-pointer to cut the lead to 107-102 with about five minutes left. Young said he couldn't appreciate his big night since the Hawks came up short. ""For me, I've grown up with a dad who raised me that winning is the only thing that matters,"" he said. ""So for me, of course you want to play well, of course you want to do well in the game and help your team, but at the end of the day I don't feel good about it."" Vince Carter got the Hawks within one with a 3-pointer later in the third quarter before Houston scored five quick points, capped by a basket from Harden to make it 82-76 with about four minutes left in the third. Alex Len added a 3 for Atlanta after that but the Rockets padded the lead to 90-79 with an 8-0 run. The Hawks got within seven late in the third, but Paul made a shot while being foul and completed the 3-point play to leave Houston up 95-85 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Hawks: Collins had 20 points. ... Kevin Huerter had seven points in his return after missing the last two games with a sprained left ankle. ... Carter received a flagrant 1 foul in the third quarter when he knocked Austin Rivers to the court on a fast break. Rockets: It was Paul's third straight 20-point game. ... Iman Shumpert returned after missing the last two games with a sore right knee. ... Kenneth Faried had 13 points and has scored at least 10 points in all 15 games as a Rocket, which is the longest streak of his career. OLD FRIENDS Vince Carter took a second to chat with Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon, who was sitting courtside on Monday night. The Dream and Carter were teammates in Olajuwon's final NBA season in 2001-02, when he left the Rockets after 17 seasons to play for the Raptors at 39. Carter, who is in his 20th season, is currently the oldest player in the NBA at 42. THEY SAID IT Paul on Young's performance: ""He was hooping. It's funny because coach (D'Antoni) and everybody was like, `Man he can play.' I was like, `Yeah we knew that.""","401071576"
"LeBron James discusses how the Lakers should approach games against teams under .500, as well as the importance of Reggie Bullock. (0:38) MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Lakers got a triple-double from LeBron James and 32 points from Brandon Ingram but still suffered another dent to their playoff hopes. Mike Conley had 30 points including key free throws in the final minute, Jonas Valanciunas finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds, and the Memphis Grizzlies beat Los Angeles 110-105 on Monday night. The loss to the Grizzlies, in next-to-last place in the West, came two days after the Lakers lost 128-115 to the Pelicans in New Orleans. That game had James wondering if his teammates' lack of experience in the playoff hunt had them prepared for the pressure and grind of trying to reach the postseason. This time, James, who finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, couched his comments with optimism, saying it is up to him and his teammates to continue their push. ""Just to stay positive and keep knocking on the door,"" James said when asked about improving through the final stretch of the regular season. ""I feel like if we play like we did (Monday), then we've got to continue that consistent effort to get us over this hump while we make this push."" Kyle Kuzma finished with 22 for Los Angeles, which is tied with Minnesota in 10th place in the Western Conference -- three games out of the final playoff spot occupied by San Antonio. ""I was very pleased with the effort and the togetherness of our group,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""I thought we got back to what we were doing earlier in the season. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough plays."" Joakim Noah had 14 points and 12 rebounds, while Avery Bradley scored 15 points for Memphis, which ended a four-game skid. Memphis led 105-98 with 1:42 left, but a 3-pointer from Kuzma and layup from James pulled the Lakers within 105-103 with a minute left. Conley converted 3 of 4 free throws down the stretch, and one Lakers possession ended with an offensive foul on James. An airball on a 3-point attempt by James with 16 seconds left gave the Grizzlies the ball with a 108-103 lead. Bradley made a pair of free throws with nine seconds left to provide the winning margin. It was the first time that Valanciunas had been a part of a win at FedExForum since joining the team at the trade deadline. ""It felt really good and was really needed,"" the 7-foot center said. ""It's fun to play with this group."" TIP-INS Lakers: G Lonzo Ball missed his 12th straight game with a left ankle sprain. ... With an assist in the first quarter, James moved past Andre Miller for 10th place in NBA history. James entered the game tied with Miller with 8,524 assists. ... Los Angeles shot 70 percent (14 of 20) in the first quarter, but trailed 34-31. For the game, the Lakers shot 45 percent. ... James had 10 points in the fourth. ... Ingram was 12 of 18 from the field, including all three of his 3-pointers. Grizzlies: Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said before the game there was no medical update on F Jaren Jackson Jr. (right thigh bruise) or timetable for his return. ... He also had no update on Kyle Anderson, who missed his 10th straight game with right shoulder soreness. Anderson sought a third opinion on the injury last week. ... Bradley was helped to the locker room with 2:22 left in the third quarter when he rolled his ankle in front of the Grizzlies bench after trying to block Kuzma's shot. He returned in the fourth quarter. HAPPY BIRTHDAY Noah, the Grizzlies' reserve center, turned 34 on Monday. ""I'm really happy that we got the win,"" Noah said. ""I got my people in the building too. And, you know, that's what it's all about -- playing against the best players, beating the Lakers, competing, winning and just coming back to the locker room happy."" ONE OF A KIND Noah has brought a new energy to the Grizzlies. Asked if he had played with anyone as intense as Noah, Valanciunas replied: ""Uh, no. I've never played with a guy like this. I'm happy to be part of that.""","401071577"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns took full advantage of his unexpected weekend off. There won't be any more breaks down the stretch for him or the Minnesota Timberwolves. Towns had 34 points and 21 rebounds in his return from the concussion protocol, helping the Timberwolves stave off the Sacramento Kings 112-105 on Monday. Derrick Rose added 20 points and Tyus Jones pitched in 16 points, eight assists and three steals for the Timberwolves, who split the previous two games without Towns, while he recovered following a highway crash last week involving the car he was riding in . The accident ended Towns' streak of 302 consecutive starts to begin his NBA career. ""You're so used to just grinding your body to dust every single day, and you don't get a chance to realize how much you appreciate being there,"" Towns said. ""I've always wanted to be available for my teammates, be available for the Wolves, but when you sit out you're looking at a different perspective."" Rookie Marvin Bagley III had 25 points and 11 rebounds and De'Aaron Fox scored 23 points for the Kings (31-29), who like the Timberwolves (29-31) are just below the cut for the Western Conference playoffs along with the Los Angeles Lakers (29-31). The Kings, who haven't reached the postseason since 2006, began the night tied in the loss column with the seventh-place San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers. ""We've got to set a different intensity, a different edge, a different animal,"" said Towns, who went 13 for 18 from the floor and also had five assists. ""This is the time. We've got to make a push."" The fast-breaking Kings wore down the Wolves, who had Jones in the starting lineup at point guard for the injured Jeff Teague, as they whittled away at a 17-point deficit in the third quarter. After Andrew Wiggins bricked a 3-pointer -- he went 1-for-7 from behind the arc and finished with only eight points -- to bring boos from the home crowd, Harrison Barnes sank two free throws for his first points of the game that cut the lead to 106-101 with 3:43 remaining. Bagley's 3-pointer brought the Kings within 108-104 with 3:05 left. The Wolves had 22 turnovers, one off their season high, but Jones stole the ball from Fox on consecutive possessions in the closing minutes. Rose sank the game-sealing jumper with 29 seconds left to push the lead back past two possessions. ""We're growing, and it's the level of experience that is required,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They've got a lot of older guys that have been through it."" Joerger slid Barnes back to the small forward spot, sent Bogdan Bogdanovich to the second unit and gave the 6-foot-11 Bagley, the second overall pick in the draft last summer, just his second start of the season in the desire for a bigger lineup. Still, Towns took over the game with an 18-point second quarter. The Kings actually led by as many as 13 points late in the first quarter, a start fueled as much by a 0 for 10 start by the Wolves from 3-point range, but Taj Gibson sparked the rally with his usual grinding work underneath before Towns got going. The two-time All-Star who's just 23 years old made three 3-pointers and a windmill dunk to finish a fast break during a 20-1 run by the Wolves that put them up 48-39. ""He was fresh,"" Gibson said. BENCHED BUDDY Buddy Hield, who had 18 points on 7-for-16 shooting and five turnovers, was on the bench for the final 5:42. Joerger declined to elaborate on his decision, other than declaring Hield had ""a tough night."" He posted a minus-18 rating. ""I'm not going to lie to you. It's hard,"" Hield said. ""It's hard to watch. You want to be out there. But you've still got to respect the guys out there, too."" TIP-INS Kings: Barnes finished with just two points on 0-for-4 shooting from the floor, his lowest total since a one-point game for Golden State on March 31, 2015. In six games since arriving in a trade with Dallas, Barnes is just 21 for 65 from the field and 7 for 30 from 3-point range for 62 points. ... Bagley had his 13th double-double. Timberwolves: This was the seventh 30-point, 20-rebound, five-assist game in franchise history, the second by Towns. ... Rose hit a 3-pointer with 3:56 left in the third quarter for an 86-70 lead, ending a 0-for-22 stretch from long range. Having missed six games to an ankle injury over that stretch, Rose's last make was on Jan. 15.","401071578"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Ben Simmons' razzle-dazzle passes and Tobias Harris' shooting were enough to put the Philadelphia 76ers in firm control until it all nearly unraveled and 7-foot-3 center Boban Marjanovic went down clutching his right knee. Harris scored 29 points, Simmons had 14 points and 12 assists, and the Sixers narrowly held off the New Orleans Pelicans 111-110 on Monday night. ""We wanted to win. We won. We're happy that we won. A teammate got hurt. ... It's sad to see a teammate go down,"" Simmons said when asked to sum up the night. Marjanovic had 12 points, 10 rebound and two blocks in less than 22 minutes to help fill the void in the middle created by the absence of 7-foot All-Star Joel Embiid, who has missed all three of  Philadelphia's games since the All-Star break. But Marjanovic's right leg got tangled up between Pelicans forward Cheick Diallo's legs as both players crashed to the court after pursuing a rebound. Marjanovic needed assistance getting off the court and later used crutches to get the team bus. Shortly after Sixers coach Brett Brown sought out Marjanovic in the trainer's room, a team spokesman said the injury would be further evaluated on Tuesday, when an MRI was scheduled. ""It was tough to see him go down and be in pain. So, I'm praying that everything will be all right for him and we can get him back ASAP,"" Harris said. ""He did an amazing job out there when he was playing."" Philadelphia nearly squandered a 10-point lead after Jimmy Butler's 12-foot jumper made it 110-100 with 2:48 left. The Sixers missed five shots and three of four free throws -- including two misses by Jonathon Simmons with 9 seconds left -- allowing the Pelicans a chance to win it with any type of field goal on their last possession. ""My head at the moment is completely with Boban, to be frank,"" Brown said when asked about his team nearly squandering the lead. ""So whatever level of disappointment I may have, I don't feel it so much now. We won the game and I'm really thinking about him."" With no timeouts, New Orleans scrambled to get the ball up the court after Philadelphia's last missed free throw and E'Twaun Moore attempted a 25-foot heave from the left wing with about 3 seconds on the clock when he pulled up. The shot was not close and Harris secured the rebound as time expired. Gentry said the first option as to get the ball to guard Jrue Holiday. ""Obviously, we weren't able to do that,"" Gentry said, adding that Butler ""did a great job"" of hustling to contest Moore's shot. ""E'Twaun shooting that shot -- we have to live with that."" Anthony Davis scored 18 points in 21 minutes, but was taken out of the game for good with 5:11 left in the third quarter as the Pelicans continue limiting his playing time since his trade request in late January. Holiday had 22 points for New Orleans. His 3-pointer pulled New Orleans as close as 110-107 with 1:36 left, but he missed a 3-point attempt that could have tied it with 45 seconds left and also missed a free throw with 18 seconds left. Julius Randle added 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Pelicans, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the third quarter. TIP-INS 76ers: Mike Scott scored 12 on 4-of-5 shooting from 3-point range. He missed all four of his 2-point attempts ... Butler had 11 points, but missed 11 of 16 shots. ... Philadelphia turned the ball over 20 times, leading to 23 Pelicans points. Pelicans: Elfrid Payton scored 10 points, giving him double figures scoring in all three games since he returned from a right ankle sprain that sidelined him the last nine games before the All-Star break. ... Reserve forward Cheick Diallo made all four of his shots for eight points in 18 minutes, making him 12 of 12 from the field during his last two games. EARLY EXIT Davis said he knew he would not play in the fourth quarter because he and Gentry discussed bunching his limited minutes on the court closer together during the first three periods. ""That way I can stay in a rhythm longer,"" Davis said. ""I've never been a guy who sat in the fourth quarter, you know, so it's a little tough. But I'll sit on the bench and cheer for these guys and they did a good job.""","401071579"
"LOS ANGELES --  Fully recovered from a stomach bug that slowed him a day earlier, Montrezl Harrell brought his trademark energy against Dallas. Harrell scored a career-high 32 points, Lou Williams added 21 and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Mavericks 121-112 on Monday to move into the seventh spot in the Western Conference playoff picture. Harrell had eight dunks, rattling the rim with one- and two-handed jams, including five in the first half. ""The win, that's what it's about right now,"" Harrell said. ""That's more important than those stats."" Rookie Luka Doncic returned after missing two games with a sore right ankle to post his fourth triple-double for the Mavericks, who lost their fifth in a row. He had 28 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Danilo Gallinari added 20 points for the Clippers. Williams had 10 assists. Led by Harrell and Williams, the Clippers' bench scored 71 points. ""He dominated his position,"" Williams said of Harrell. Los Angeles led by nine points early in the fourth, with Harrell storming the lane for two more dunks. The Mavericks closed to 105-103 on seven straight points, including Tim Hardaway Jr.'s 3-pointer. Dallas never got closer. The Clippers got 3-pointers from Williams and Patrick Beverley and Harrell completed a three-point play to extend their lead to 116-108. ""We didn't do a good job,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When you have a guy like Williams out there that you run around trapping, the Harrell's of the world are going to be more effective."" Doncic's 3-pointer tied the game at 78-all in the third, when he had 11 points. Harrell and Williams combined to score 12 of the Clippers' last 15 points of the third, giving them a 91-88 lead going into the fourth. Dwight Powell had 24 points and Hardaway Jr. finished with 20 points for the Mavericks. DONCIC'S TURNOVERS Doncic had nine turnovers, something Carlisle says he's prone to because he gets trapped every game. ""He thinks he can thread any needle and throw the ball through one guy's nose and out his rear end,"" the coach said. ""You just can't do that in this league on a consistent basis."" WEST CAN'T WAIT Clippers consultant Jerry West says he ""can't wait for summer to get here."" That's when the Clippers are expected to be a major player in the free agent market. West told a pre-game gathering of select Clippers fans that he's ""shocked"" in a good way by the team's 34-28 record. ""We have guys with no ego on this team. The future is bright,"" West said. HONORING DIRK With nine seconds to go in the game, Clippers coach Doc Rivers grabbed the public address announcer's mic to salute Dirk Nowitzki, who received a standing ovation. ""I just felt he deserved that,"" Rivers said. Nowitzki scored 12 points on 3-of-10 shooting in his 1,500th career game. ""I got the game ball,"" he said. ""Coming in 20 years ago, my first year struggling like that, I never thought I'm getting to 1,500 NBA games. It's been a great rollercoaster career with a lot of ups and downs."" The 14-time All-Star hasn't announced that he's retiring, saying only that he'll wait to make the decision based on how his body feels at season's end. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic turns 20 on Thursday. He visited with boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. after the game. ""He said he play like me,"" Doncic said. ""I said I want to see it live.""... They fell to 2-17 against the West on the road. ... Split the season series with LA 2-2. Clippers: Harrell had 30 points at Memphis last Friday. ... They improved to 5-6 overall and 1/3 at home in the second game of a back-to-back, having lost at Denver on Sunday.","401071580"
"NEW YORK --  If the Knicks are supposed to be tanking, someone forgot to tell their back-ups. Emmanuel Mudiay, Mitchell Robinson and the rest of the New York Knicks who came off the bench outscored the Orlando Magic's reserves by a whopping 75-7 in a 108-103 win on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. Mudiay finished with 19 points and Robinson added 17 points, 14 rebounds, six blocks, and three steals to help the Knicks win their second straight game at home after they dropped 18 in a row at MSG. Robinson joined Ralph Sampson (1984) and David Robinson (1989) as the only rookies to post those numbers in a game since blocks became an official stat in 1973-73. ""He's making history right now,"" said Knicks Coach David Fizdale. ""Every single day he continues to grow and get better. His impact on the defensive end is special. The guy is blocking jumpers. He's guarding guards."" The Knicks never led in the game until Robinson's free throw with 2:57 remaining put New York in front 101-100. Henry Ellison followed with a 3-pointer and Mudiay hit two free throws with 33 seconds left. Ellison, who is on a 10-day contract and was only appearing in his second game with the Knicks, played 36 minutes off the bench and finished with 13 points, nine rebounds and five assists. ""Coach Fiz left me in there for a while,"" Ellison said. ""I looked back a couple of times because I didn't expect it. He just gave me an opportunity to go out there and play. It was a lot of fun. I couldn't tell you the last time I played 36 minutes."" Terrence Ross' 3-pointer with 28 second remaining brought the Magic within three. Allonzo Trier, another back-up, then hit two free throws five seconds later for the final margin.  He finished with 18 points. ""Coach is doing what he does with the lineup based on how he feels during the game and he had the whole bench together and it worked tonight,"" Trier explained. Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon each scored 26 points for the Magic, who held a 16-point lead in the second quarter. They were still up 90-78 entering the fourth. New York outscored Orlando 11-1 to open the final quarter and eventually pulled even on Robinson's alley-oop dunk from Trier with four minutes left. The Knicks have now won three of four after losing 18 straight games. ""They play with nothing to lose,"" Gordon said. ""When they get confidence and start making shots, they feel like they can play with anybody so that's what they did."" Jonathan Isaac scored 16 points and Evan Fournier added 15 for the Magic, who had won six of their previous seven games. TIP-INS: Magic: Markelle Fultz, the top pick of the 2017 NBA Draft, was traded by Philadelphia to Orlando on Feb. 7. He played in 19 games for the 76ers, but is suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome and has yet to take the floor for the Magic. Knicks: DeAndre Jordan, who leads the Knicks in rebounding (12.4 rpg in his five games with the team), missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle. . Frank Ntilikina has missed 13 consecutive games with a groin injury. NO PLAYOFF PAYOFF A Magic victory on Tuesday would have put them into eighth place and the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference by a percentage point over the Charlotte Hornets. Orlando hasn't made the playoffs since the strike-shortened 2011-12 season (37-29), the last of six straight playoff appearances. STANDING ALONE Only one player from each team has played in every game this season. Ross has seen action in all 62 games for the Magic and Noah Vonleh is the only Knick to have played in all 61 of their games. Vonleh has started 50 times, while Ross has never been on the floor for tipoff.","401071581"
"TORONTO --  A lack of togetherness is turning into big trouble for the struggling Boston Celtics. Pascal Siakam scored 25 points, Kawhi Leonard had 21 and the Toronto Raptors used a huge second quarter to rout Boston 118-95 on Tuesday night. Marcus Morris scored 17 points, and Jayson Tatum and Terry Rozier each had 11 as Boston lost for the fifth time in seven games. The Celtics are 0-3 since play resumed following the All-Star break. ""We have to be a lot more connected as a team,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""That's been the theme for a while."" Celtics guard Marcus Smart echoed his coach's assessment. ""Nobody is together,"" Smart said. ""We've got to have everybody on the same page doing the same things at the same time."" Still, Celtics guard Kyrie Irving wasn't on the same page when asked to respond to Smart's comments. ""That's Marcus' opinion,"" Irving said, declining to answer after being asked whether he agreed with his teammate. Irving also had little to say about Stevens' comment that Boston is taking too many ""shortcuts"" on defense. ""I don't know,"" Irving said. ""It's up to Brad."" Irving scored seven points. It was his lowest-scoring game since he had three points against Detroit on Oct. 27. Serge Ibaka scored 14 points and Norm Powell added 11 as Toronto extended its home winning streak over Boston to eight. The Celtics have not win in Canada since a 117-116 overtime victory on April 4, 2015. Kyle Lowry had 11 assists and Toronto led by as many as 31, turning the game around by outscoring Boston 36-13 in the decisive second. ""Everything they did took us out of what we wanted to do,"" Boston's Al Horford said. The Raptors have won 15 of 17 at home, where they're 26-6 overall. Toronto made 17 3-pointers, one shy of a season-high. Siakam matched his career-best by connecting four times in five attempts from long range. The Celtics led 32-30 after one quarter and scored the opening points of the second, but the Raptors answered with an 18-0 run to lead 48-34 at 7:14. Leonard's fast break dunk at 3:06 put Toronto up by 20, 59-39. ""We locked in a little more,"" Siakam said. ""We got some stops. Obviously, when we get stops we're dangerous in transition."" The Celtics had twice as many turnovers in the second quarter (eight) as made baskets (four). ""I thought we were outplayed in every which way,"" Stevens said. Toronto led 66-45 at halftime. TIP-INS Celtics: G Brad Wanamaker (illness) was not available. ... The Celtics shot six for 30 from 3-point range. ... Boston has lost three straight on the road. Raptors: Toronto had 11 assists on 14 made baskets in the second. ... The Raptors went 8-1 in February. ... Toronto lost both visits to Boston this season, including one overtime defeat.

"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic is making his presence felt down the stretch, and that's the way the Denver Nuggets want it. Jokic scored 36 points, including five free throws in the final moments, and the Nuggets fended off Oklahoma City's late rally for a 121-112 victory Tuesday night in a matchup between two of the top three teams in the Western Conference standings. ""When the game's on the line, we're going to one guy: Nikola Jokic,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He's been able to score in the post against single coverage, double teams. We've won so many close games ... and a lot of those you can attribute to Nikola being effective and efficient in the post and score, make the right play or go to the foul line and make a free throw."" Jokic said he's getting to the point where he's looking for the ball and anticipating it will come his way at crunch time, and it's a role he is embracing. ""Even if I don't score, I think I can bring something. I can make a good pass,"" Jokic said. ""I think the coaches are comfortable to call plays for me and I think the team trusts me."" Jokic added 10 assists and nine rebounds to finish just shy of his 13th triple-double this season for the Nuggets who won their fifth straight and ninth in a row at home. They improved to 3-0 against the Thunder this season, clinching the four-game season series between the Northwest Division rivals. ""To have beaten them three times this year says a lot about our team. I don't even think we've played our best basketball yet,"" Malone said. Will Barton added 23 points and Jamal Murray 20 for Denver, which extended its division lead over the Thunder to four games. Paul George had 25 points to lead Oklahoma City which fought back from an 18-point deficit in the second half but could not sustain its rally in the late going. Russell Westbrook finish an assist shy of a triple-double with 22 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists. Jerami Grant added 21 points. Oklahoma City got back into the game by turning up its defense, forcing five turnovers in six Denver possessions in one stretch, to pull into a 97-all tie on a 3-pointer by Dennis Schroder with 6:02 left to play. Westbrook followed by hitting a 3-pointer to give the Thunder its first lead since early in the first half. Denver, though, fought back, retaking the lead on a 3-pointer by Murray. The game remained tight down the stretch. Murray hit another 3-pointer and Jokic put in a layup around a Westbrook layup for a 112-106 Denver lead with 1:36 remaining. Jokic helped Denver solidify its lead and quash Oklahoma City's comeback in the final moments by making five of six free throws to boost the Nuggets' advantage to 117-108 with 44 seconds remaining. ""We had some things that we were able to control that we didn't do a good enough job of, and that part of it was disappointing,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Because the guys, I thought, battled and worked so hard to get back in the game to give ourselves a chance."" Trailing by 13 at the half, the Thunder scored the first eight points of the third quarter, including 3-pointers by Westbrook and George to equal the number of 3s Oklahoma City had in the first half. But the Nuggets' got going on offense again and pulled in front by as many as 18 points before George hit a 3-pointer from the half-court line as the Thunder pulled to 91-78 going into the fourth quarter. Jokic connected on successive 3-pointers in the last 56 seconds of the second quarter, and Denver moved in front 64-51 at the half. KEY CONTRIBUTOR Jokic wasn't the only one with impact plays down the stretch. Paul Millsap, who had 12 points and 10 rebounds, delivered a huge block in the fourth quarter to help blunt Oklahoma City's comeback and in the late going grabbed an offensive rebound and put back a key layup. ""I just thought all his hustle plays down the stretch were tremendous for us,"" Malone said. TIP-INS Thunder: G/F Andre Roberson, who has yet to play this season because of a left patellar tendon injury, has resumed light basketball activities and the Thunder remain hopeful he can return this season. ""We're all optimistic that maybe at some point, we can get him back,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""He's working really hard. He's making strides. How that progresses, we'll have to wait and see, but to me it's encouraging to see he is kind of jogging around a little bit out there and he is shooting the ball."" Nuggets: F Trey Lyles missed a third consecutive game with a left hamstring strain.","401071583"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni replaced Kenneth Faried in the starting lineup with Eric Gordon on Wednesday night, a move designed to cut down wear and tear on Chris Paul's body. The reasoning behind the move was D'Antoni doesn't want Paul chasing point guards like Charlotte's Kemba Walker all over the court and running off screens this late in the season. Instead, the goal was to have Gordon cover Walker. Well, that plan got ditched after one half. Paul told D'Antoni at halftime he wanted to guard Walker after the Hornets three-time All-Star erupted for 27 points on 9-of-10 shooting. D'Antoni agreed, and the change worked -- Paul helped hold Walker to eight points in the second half as the Rockets escaped with a 118-113 win. James Harden scored 30 points, Clint Capela had 23 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, and the Rockets won their third straight. Paul also heated up in the fourth quarter and finished with 17 points and 10 assists for the Rockets (36-25). ""I would rather not (guard Walker) as much as possible, but I also like playing defense,"" Paul said, adding that nobody in the league changes pace like Walker does, making him a difficult cover. In his first game since ending his streak of 30-point games at 32, Harden struggled from the field, missing his first eight shots from 3-point range -- even having one blocked by Nic Batum, who gave the MVP candidate fits all night with his defense. Harden finished 10 of 29 from the field and 1 of 11 from 3-point range, but he made two clutch free throws with 14.6 seconds left to put the game away. Harden has been bothered by a neck injury the past few games. ""I'm trying to figure out how to run and move my neck at the same time,"" Harden said. ""Just getting a feel for the game, but I will be all right."" ""He was just out of sync,"" D'Antoni said, saying the recent schedule got to him. ""And, the start to the year it takes him about three or four games to get back into rhythm. He will be fine and that is the least of my worries."" Harden had plenty of support, especially from Capela, who was all over the glass. The Rockets trailed by four entering the fourth quarter but opened with an 18-4 run behind six points from Paul, including four on fall-away mid-range jumpers. The Hornets battled back behind Walker and Jeremy Lamb, who had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and had a chance to tie with 17 seconds left. Walker missed a leaning 3-pointer from the right wing and the Hornets fouled Harden, who made two free throws to make it a five-point game. Walker missed another 3 with seven seconds left. ""Maybe it was some attitude adjustments,"" D'Antoni said of his team's second-half defense. ""We just played harder. In the second quarter, we lost our spirit completely and (the Hornets) played well."" The Hornets are a half-game ahead of the Magic in the battle for the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. ""We just have to stay confident,"" Walker said. ""We are playing really hard, competing our butts off. That's really all that matters."" TIP INS Rockets: Scored 41 points in the first quarter on 61 percent shooting. ... Faried didn't start but still managed to pick up his fourth foul by the middle of the second quarter. ... Gordon had six points and missed all five 3-point attempts in the start. Hornets: Walker became the first Eastern Conference player to reach 200 3-pointers when he buried a step-back jumper against Harden in the first quarter. PAUL'S RETURN Paul, who grew up in Winston-Salem and played at Wake Forest, said he enjoyed finally getting a chance to play a regular-season game in his home state. He'd missed the last two because of injuries. ""So I'm sure my grandparents and all my family -- all 300 of them that came to the game -- enjoyed it,"" Paul said with a laugh. ""It's nice to play here and not be in a suit."" BATUM'S DEFENSE Batum's defense on Harden was outstanding all night as he flustered the MVP candidate at times and made a couple steals which led to dunks. But Batum wasn't relishing in his effort after the game, saying ""we still lost the game so it doesn't mean anything to me. ... We did a good job, trying to contain them, had a game plan. But they made plays.""","401071584"
"ATLANTA --  Trae Young and John Collins showed a glimpse of the Atlanta Hawks' long-range plan. In the process, they helped make it more difficult for Minnesota to realize its playoff dream this year. Young matched the career high he set earlier in the week with 36 points, Collins had 34 and the Hawks beat the Timberwolves 131-123 in overtime Wednesday night. Young, a rookie, and Collins, in his second season, are the foundation of the Hawks' rebuilding effort with first-year coach Lloyd Pierce. Veteran Vince Carter, still playing important minutes at 42 -- 10 years older than Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders -- said he's enjoying watching the kids grow into winners. ""It's just great to see two guys having wonderful games like that while still making plays for others,"" said Carter, who scored 17 points, including a 3-pointer to open overtime. ""That's what it's all about."" Collins scored 18 points in the fourth quarter as Atlanta, which trailed by 13 points late in the third period, rallied to force the extra period. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves with 37 points and 17 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins had 21 points. It was a damaging loss for Minnesota, which fell four games behind San Antonio and the Los Angeles Clippers, in an eighth-place tie in the Western Conference playoff race. ""We hope that one game isn't gonna affect our chances at the end but you can point to a lot of one games,"" Saunders said. ""We just need to bounce back."" The Timberwolves (29-32) fell to 9-22 on the road. ""We made it tough on ourselves,"" Towns said. ""It was that simple. ... We made the same mistakes. Costs us every time. So we'll learn, we'll learn one day."" Atlanta's DeAndre Bembry scored six of his 16 points in overtime, including back-to-back baskets for a 125-118 lead. Following a timeout, Towns had a jam and a 3-pointer -- his season-high fifth of the game. Bembry, who had only 10 points through regulation, answered with his third basket of the extra period, giving the Hawks a 127-123 advantage. Each team missed last-second shots in regulation. After Young's basket tied it at 118, Derrick Rose missed a short jumper for Minnesota. ""Derrick is one of the best point guards that ever lived so I'm OK with him taking that shot, but obviously I wanted the ball so I could shoot,"" Towns said. Atlanta called timeout with 0.5 seconds remaining. Young made a jumper off the inbounds pass from Carter, but a video review confirmed the shot came after the buzzer. Josh Okogie, the Timberwolves' rookie from Georgia Tech, had 15 points in his return to Atlanta. TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Luol Deng did not return after leaving with a sore left Achilles in the first half. ... F Robert Covington was sent to G League Iowa as he moves closer to his return from a bone bruise on his right knee. He has missed 23 consecutive games since suffering the injury on Dec. 31. Covington is expected to practice only at Iowa while the Timberwolves are on the road. ... F Cameron Reynolds was signed to a 10-day contract. Hawks: Dewayne Dedmon had seven points and 10 rebounds before fouling out with 3:06 remaining. ... Kent Bazemore's frustration grew as he missed each of his 12 shots through three quarters. He complained when no foul was called on a miss late in the period and drew a technical foul. He missed two shots -- a 3-pointer and a layup -- on Atlanta's next possession and didn't attempt another shot. ... Bembry also had a double-double with 14 rebounds.

Young, who scored a career-high 36 points in a loss at Houston on Monday night, stayed hot with 20 first-half points. He had help; every Atlanta starter had scored by the time the Hawks led 19-10.","401071585"
"Kyrie Irving says he is tired of ""talking over and over and over again"" about the Celtics getting better as he just wants to play playoff basketball. (0:29) BOSTON --  The Portland Trail Blazers have come to the other side of the country and beat up some of the Eastern Conference's best teams. Of course, at the moment, it's not clear where in that hierarchy the Boston Celtics belong. The Trail Blazers beat Boston 97-92 on Wednesday night for the Celtics' fourth straight loss. It was the fifth consecutive win overall for Portland, and the fourth during a five-game swing that has also included victories over playoff hopefuls Philadelphia and Brooklyn. Damian Lillard scored 33 points, Maurice Harkless had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Portland improved to 18-4 against the East this season. ""We're playing together offensively. Defensively, we've been sharp,"" Lillard said. ""We're getting it from everybody on both ends of the floor and just being consistent. When you get that type of consistent effort from multiple guys -- everybody in the rotation -- this is what it looks like."" Jusef Nurkic scored 16 points, and CJ McCollum finished with 14 points for the Blazers. ""There's a lot to like about that game,"" coach Terry Stotts said. The struggling Celtics are winless since the All-Star break. Kyrie Irving scored 31 points to lead Boston, which was coming off a 118-95 rout at Toronto and didn't lead after the first quarter Wednesday. While Boston played better, the Celtics' recent struggles continued. ""It just wasn't enough,"" Irving said. ""We know what we're capable of. When we don't play to that level, we know it. There's no sugar coating it."" Jaylen Brown had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, Jayson Tatum had 14 points, and Marcus Smart and Al Horford scored 13 each. Boston coach Brad Stevens said the Celtics seemed to be pressing for a better performance than the previous night. Boston is fifth in the conference, well behind East-leading Milwaukee. ""I think we were disappointed in ourselves and we looked like a team that really wanted tonight to go well. And it didn't,"" Stevens said. ""You're going to have games like that and so, (I'm) a lot more encouraged tonight than I was last night."" Irving gave Boston a chance with a 3-pointer with 28 seconds left, cutting Portland's lead to 95-92, but the Celtics were forced to foul, and Lillard sealed it with two free throws with 12 seconds left. Lillard also pulled down seven rebounds, and Portland outrebounded the Celtics 48-41. MONSTER MO Lillard credited Harkless for helping keep the Celtics from establishing much inside and hustling throughout the night. Harkless made 8 of 15 shots, had three steals and committed just one foul and one turnover. ""He was a monster,"" Lillard said. NO CANADA Portland's Enes Kanter will not travel with the team for its game at Toronto on Friday, remaining in the United States because of visa concerns. A native of Turkey and outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Kanter's Turkish passport was revoked in 2017. Kanter did not travel for a game in London when he was still a member of the New York Knicks last month. Kanter, who scored eight points Wednesday, said it was especially disappointing that he couldn't be with his new team when they take on the top team in the East. ""The Toronto game is one of our, you know, most important games,"" Kanter said. ""So that's why it's just, just because of one dictator I can't even go out there and do my job. It's pretty sad.""

"NEW YORK --  Bradley Beal capped off the best month of his career with yet another 30-point night. Now the All-Star guard is looking to carry his hot shooting into March with the eighth and final spot in the Eastern Conference up for grabs. Beal scored 31 points, Trevor Ariza had 23 points and 10 rebounds, and the Washington Wizards beat the Brooklyn Nets 125-116 on Wednesday night. Beal finished February averaging a career-high 30.9 points while shooting 52.2 percent from the field. ""It's a huge accomplishment. I just want to win, whatever it looks like,"" said Beal, who scored 17 points in the first half. ""Sometimes it's going to involve me scoring 30-plus and some nights I won't have to. So whatever it looks like, I want to go out there and get it done. Super confident right now in my game. Just trying to make the playoffs."" The victory moved Washington within three games of eighth-place Charlotte. Reserve Thomas Bryant had 18 points and Bobby Portis finished with 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Wizards, who led by as many as 28 points. Washington had lost four straight and nine out of 12. D'Angelo Russell scored 28 points for the Nets, who had their two-game winning streak snapped. Washington looked like a team on its way to another loss after Brooklyn jumped out to a 10-0 lead on Joe Harris' 3-pointer before Wizards coach Scott Brooks called a timeout with 9:39 to play in the opening quarter. Washington regrouped and outscored the Nets 34-18 the rest of the period as Beal scored 13 points. ""This one stings. You know you could feel it when everybody was walking into the locker room afterwards,"" Harris said. ""It was really uncharacteristic of our team."" The Wizards then took a 68-60 lead heading into halftime after recording 23 assists on their 26 field goals. The Wizards then put the game out of reach midway through the third quarter during a five-minute stretch in which the Nets turned the ball over six times and missed four shots. Beal scored four straight points to open the second half for a 72-60 lead. Ariza later had 11 points in a 17-3 run as Washington extended its lead to 89-65 with 5:55 left in the period on a pair of free throws from Jeff Green. Brooks, who before the game lauded Ariza for his leadership and said he could have used the forward during his previous coaching stint at Oklahoma City, credited his veteran's activity on defense for breaking open the game. ""Brad has done a great job and I think Trevor has come in and stepped in also,"" Brooks said. ""We need veteran guys that play with that type of edge and he does. He's making some shots tonight. Hopefully that keeps going."" A jumper by Jared Dudley ended Brooklyn's scoreless drought with 5:35 remaining in the quarter. TIP-INS Wizards: C Dwight Howard (back surgery) joined the team for its short two-game road trip. He did some agility drills prior to the game. Brooks said he was unsure when Howard will return. Nets: G Allen Crabbe's first 3-pointer of the night was his 287th as a member of the Nets, moving him past Richard Jefferson into sole possession of 10th place in franchise history. Crabbe has made 288 3s as a Net since coming over last season. REINFORCEMENT IS ON THE WAY Spencer Dinwiddie, who has missed his last 13 games due to torn ligaments in his right thumb, is close to returning for the Nets. Dinwiddie participated in a pregame workout and Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson is aware the combo guard's return to the lineup could balance an offense that has relied more often on the 3-point shot instead of driving in the lane. The Nets shot 19 for 50 from long distance in Monday night's win over San Antonio. ""I'll say this, he is very close to returning. Very close,"" Atkinson said. ""I'll leave it at that. Very close. He's been doing a lot on the court. I think he's close to being ready."" GET WELL SOON, MR. BASKETBALL Atkinson considers New York City playground legend ""Pearl"" Washington as perhaps the best high school basketball player in the city. But he also recalls the handful of times he matched up against Nets great Kenny Anderson, who is recovering from a stroke he suffered Saturday night. Atkinson was on the 13th-seeded University of Richmond team that surprised Anderson's fifth-seeded Georgia Tech team in the second round of the 1988 NCAA Tournament. ""Incredible, incredible player. Incredible high school player. Incredible college player,"" Atkinson said of the 48-year-old Anderson. ""He had a sixth sense, like that city sense that guys like me didn't have,"" Atkinson said. ""Incredible instincts to steal the ball, to see the court, quick as .Tiny Archibald. I loved that. I was a huge Kenny Anderson fan and I know what a great player he was.""","401071587"
"MIAMI -- Dwyane Wade jumped onto a courtside table and thumped himself on the chest three times. He took a victory lap, waving a towel. He got mobbed by teammates. He's been part of games that meant more. But bigger moments -- there haven't been many, if any, than this one. Wade's one-legged, off-the-glass, straightaway 3-point heave as time expired lifted the Miami Heat to a 126-125 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, a game where the Heat wasted every bit of a 24-point lead and had to rally from four points down in the final minute. ""I've been in this position so many times and so many times you don't make the shot,"" Wade said. ""And the one I make is a one-legged flick from my chest. It's crazy. Great to do it in front of fans."" Kevin Durant made one of two free throws with 14 seconds left, putting Golden State up by two. The Heat had no timeouts, no way to set up a play, and there was no way anyone could have drawn up what happened. Wade brought the ball up, drove into the lane, stutter-stepped and lost the ball for a brief moment. He gathered it and shoveled it to Dion Waiters, who was double-teamed and couldn't get off a shot. Waiters tossed it back to Wade, who shot-faked Durant in the air and then had his first try blocked by Jordan Bell. Wade caught the rebound with about a second left. Off the glass, for the win. From there, bedlam. The fans erupted in cheers. Some of the Warriors watched the replay on the overhead screens with a look of disbelief, and after a moment Warriors star Stephen Curry came over to offer congratulations after presumably their last head-to-head meeting before Wade retires after this season. ""I told Steph, `I needed this one on my way out. Y'all get enough,"" Wade said. ""But it was cool. I think the one thing cool for me was I've got younger teammates that heard about some of the things you do but don't always get an opportunity to see it."" Wade scored 25 points to help Miami snap a six-game home losing streak. ""Sometimes you just need to be lucky,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said after giving Wade a long bear-hug in a jubilant postgame locker room. ""We've had so many of these breaks go against us."" Goran Dragic led the Heat with 27 points. Josh Richardson added 21, and Miami made 18 3-pointers. Klay Thompson scored 36 points for the Warriors. Durant added 29 and Curry scored 24 for the Warriors, whose lead over Denver atop the Western Conference dropped to a half-game. Golden State rallied from 19 down to win 120-118 at home on Feb. 10, and dug its way out of an even bigger hole this time -- but couldn't finish it off. Wade's 3-pointer with 15 seconds left got Miami to 124-123, and he came up with one more when the Heat needed it most. ""Dwyane just hit an unbelievable shot,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It was going in as soon as it left his hand."" Dragic had 25 points by halftime, getting 20 of those in the second quarter alone -- setting Heat single-quarter and any-half records for a reserve. He had 11 points in a span of 69 seconds in the second quarter, and a pair of free throws with 2:59 left in the half put Miami up 69-45. Against most teams, even in the first half, a 24-point lead might have been enough. The Warriors, of course, are not most teams. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Durant and Thompson helped Golden State get the lead down to 74-59 by halftime. The Warriors cut the lead to seven on two separate occasions in the third quarter, and kept whittling away in the fourth -- getting within six when Draymond Green rattled in a 3-pointer from the right corner with 8:20 left, then 106-103 when Curry connected from deep on the next possession. The Warriors led for all of 1:14 in the second half. Wade didn't let them leave with the lead. ""There is something special about him making a play like that, this his last year in this building,"" Curry said. ""I'd much rather see him jumping on the scorer's table when we're not on the court. Deep down, it was cool to see even though we lost."" TIP-INS Warriors: DeMarcus Cousins (load management and Achilles recovery) got the night off, and the Warriors said he will play in Orlando on Thursday. ... Wednesday was the sixth anniversary of Curry's career-high 54-point game at Madison Square Garden, and the third anniversary of his game-winner from about 40 feet to win at Oklahoma City. Heat: Wade, who has exchanged jerseys with an opponent after almost every game this season, kept this one as a keepsake. ... Miami was without Hassan Whiteside (hip strain) and James Johnson (shoulder sprain). Justise Winslow (knee) and Derrick Jones Jr. (flu) ... The 74 first-half points tied the second-most in Heat history. Miami scored 75 against the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 19, 1997, and 74 against Dallas on Nov. 11, 1999. ... Udonis Haslem checked in during the third quarter, playing at home for the second time this season. WADE ANNIVERSARY Wednesday marked exactly one year since Wade hit a winner to beat Philadelphia, also in Miami. ROAD WARRIORS Golden State remains one win shy of finishing with a road record over .500 for the sixth consecutive season. That would extend the longest current streak in the league, one that Toronto would match with two wins in its final 11 road games. Before this six-year road run of success, the Warriors had a road record over .500 in six of their previous 65 seasons.","401071588"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Despite sitting near the bottom of the Eastern Conference, the Chicago Bulls are on a bit of a roll and closed out their best month of the season. Zach LaVine scored 12 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter and the Bulls beat the Memphis Grizzlies 109-107 on Wednesday night. The win was the fourth in five games for Chicago, and the Bulls finished February 5-5, the first time they reached .500 in a month this season. Lauri Markkanen finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Otto Porter Jr. added 20 points for Chicago, which defeated Memphis 122-110 on Feb. 13, a victory that started the Bulls' success over the last half of the month. ""A hard-fought win for us,"" Bulls coach Jim Boylen said, noting the 20 lead changes and 15 ties. ""I don't like the 33-point fourth (quarter), and I don't like that we lost the boards (46-42), but overall, I thought our defense was pretty darn good."" On a key play in the closing seconds, Memphis was taking the ball out with 17 seconds left and trailing 106-102. As Memphis guard Mike Conley tried to use a screen by Jonas Valanciunas, he fell near midcourt and the inbounds pass sailed past him out of bounds. The turnover gave the Bulls the ball, ending any chance of the Grizzlies overtaking Chicago. That led to a postgame rant from Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff regarding the lack of respect for Conley. ""Clear as day, center of the floor, Mike Conley gets tackled,"" Bickerstaff said. The Memphis coach noted if the foul was called, Memphis would have gotten a foul shot and the ball back with a one-possession deficit. He later said of what he perceived as a lack of calls for Conley: ""It's maddening."" Avery Bradley led Memphis with 23 points and seven assists, while Conley added 21 points and six assists. Justin Holiday and Valanciunas scored 13 points apiece. In game featuring two teams residing near the bottom of their respective conferences, Chicago carried a 75-74 advantage into the fourth after three quarters with 18 lead changes, 14 ties and no team having a lead of more than six points. Chicago extended the lead to 93-85 when Markkanen scored inside with 5:30 remaining. From there, the Bulls maintained leads of five to seven points until a four-point play by Conley tightened things at 103-100 with 1:20 remaining. But Memphis couldn't overtake Chicago, as a 3-pointer at the horn by Valanciunas provided the final margin. ""We're just learning, and we're trying to get wins,"" Porter said. ""We're trying to build for the future, and trying to start something new."" TIP-INS Bulls: G Kris Dunn and F Porter both returned to the lineup after missing Monday's loss to Milwaukee, Dunn with a migraine and Porter with a left shoulder strain. . Wayne Selden reached a career-high four steals in the first half. ... Markkanen has led the Bulls in rebounds 12 of the last 14 games. . Robin Lopez scored two points, ending a string of eight straight games in double figures. Grizzlies: C/F Ivan Rabb missed the game with right heel soreness. Bruno Caboclo started in his spot. ... Before the game, Conley was awarded the NBA Cares Community Assist Award for January. .Valanciunas has scored in double figures all five games he's played with Memphis since he joined the team in a trade deadline deal. MORE BICKERSTAFF Bickerstaff's entire postgame press conference -- more than four minutes long -- was on the play where Conley was knocked down in the closing seconds with no call. He repeatedly said the team has talked to the league about the lack of calls for the Memphis point guard, but the Memphis coach sees no change in what he believes is a lack of well-earned respect for Conley. ""This season we've had the same conversation about Mike Conley and nothing has changed,"" Bickerstaff said, later adding: ""I don't know how far we have to go to get results. I'm trying to be respectful of the process. We've done that all year, and it's led to absolutely nothing. It's led to no change."" Bickerstaff went on to emphasize that a player like Conley is the kind of person the league should want to promote. ""He's not the type of person you want to continually disrespect.""","401071589"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Home never felt so good for the San Antonio Spurs. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 24 points, DeMar DeRozan had 17 points and 13 points, and the Spurs returned home after a 25-day absence to beat the Detroit Pistons 105-93 on Wednesday night and snap a three-game skid. ""They played desperate and I don't think we did the entire game,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""We played in spurts, but we didn't play desperate as long and as much as they did."" The Pistons had won three straight and seven of eight but were facing a team in dire need of a homecoming. The Spurs returned to the AT&amp;T Center for the first time since Feb. 2 after going 1-7 on their rodeo road trip, the worst they have fared on their annual excursion. San Antonio fell to eighth in the Western Conference during that stretch with 20 games remaining prior to Wednesday's outing. ""We haven't done well on the road, so we have to take care of home court at the least,"" Aldridge said. ""Tonight was a good start."" The road trip included a 12-point loss in New York against a Knicks team that had lost 18 straight at home. San Antonio ensured there wasn't a repeat of that lackadaisical effort. Marco Belinelli had 17 points off the bench and Derrick White had 15 points, six rebounds and four assists. San Antonio shot 52 percent from the field and held an opponent under 100 points for the first time since Jan. 9. The Pistons were limited to seven free throws and shot 36 percent from the field. ""When we play good defense, we have a chance to win games,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""When we were at our best this year, for that one run, we were first, second or third in every category, defensive efficiency and all that sort of thing. Then all of a sudden it went bye-bye. This is who we have to be."" Reggie Jackson scored 22 points for Detroit, which had not lost since Feb. 13 at Boston. Blake Griffin added 17 points and Andre Drummond had 10 points and 17 rebounds. The Spurs opened the game 5 for 7 on 3-pointers in building a 12-point lead, but the inconsistency that plagued them on their trip made the return flight. The Pistons went on a 17-4 run to take a 48-47 lead. San Antonio missed two shots and committed five turnovers during the drought. Belinelli's off-balance shots helped steady the Spurs. The 12-year veteran was 3 for 4 on 3-pointers, giving San Antonio the lead on his first two shots and his final 3 extending the advantage to 75-64 late in the third quarter. His off-balance, 16-footer gave the Spurs a 97-88 advantage with 3:39 remaining. ""That's how we've got to play,"" DeRozan said. ""We can't get down on ourselves when we make mistakes offensively (and) defensively. We've got to just go out there and focus, play hard, playing together and communicating. When we do those things, something always tends to go our way."" Belinelli's jumper was part of a 9-0 run after Detroit point guard Ish Smith's layup had cut it to 90-88 with 5 minutes remaining. ""I don't think we executed offensively, we just took bad shots,"" Griffin said. Jakob Poeltl added 11 points and 14 rebounds for the Spurs and also had a key block against Drummond with 2:21 remaining and the Spurs up 99-91. ""I thought he had 10 blocks but he had three,"" Aldridge said. ""It felt like 10. He was great, he was active. He definitely gave us a big spark."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit has lost four straight in San Antonio with its previous win coming Jan. 6, 2015. ... Spurs fans are still upset with Zaza Pachulia, who injured Kawhi Leonard in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals while with Golden State by stepping under the All-Star forward on a 3-pointer. Pachulia was loudly booed when he was introduced and touched the ball. ... Wayne Ellington had 11 points, leaving him one shy of 5,000. Spurs: Bryn Forbes exited the game with a bruised right calf with 5:34 remaining in the first quarter. Forbes needed assistance walking to the locker room after he and Griffin got tangled up after diving onto the floor to corral a loose ball. ... Forbes made a pair of 3-pointers before exiting, giving him 237 to surpass Manu Ginobili (236) for third among Spurs' players in their first three seasons. Gary Neal tops the list with 301 3-pointers in his first three seasons, followed by Davis Bertans at 276. . Poeltl had his first double-double as a member of the Spurs. NOT AGAIN San Antonio hosts Oklahoma City on Saturday in the second contest of a three-game homestand. The Spurs defeated the Thunder 154-147 in double overtime on Jan. 10 in their previous meeting in San Antonio. Aldridge had a career-high 56 points in the victory, the first time he hit the half-century mark in his 13-year career. ""That's not happening again,"" Aldridge said. ""No one lets you do that twice.""","401071590"
"DALLAS -- Luka Doncic made a long 3-pointer on a pass from Jalen Brunson before getting the ball to his fellow Dallas rookie for another big bucket from behind the arc. The first-year sensation's final game as a teenager turned into a big night for the two-time NCAA champion from Villanova as well. Doncic had 26 points and 10 rebounds, Brunson scored a season-high 24 points and the Mavericks ended a five-game losing streak with a 110-101 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. Doncic, the only teenager in NBA history with multiple triple-doubles, didn't have a shot at his fifth late. But the budding star and No. 3 overall draft pick who turns 20 Thursday had two of his seven assists on a pair of key 3-pointers, one of those by Brunson for an eight-point lead with a minute to go. ""I'm there to help keep the energy,"" said Brunson, a second-round pick who was 9 of 14 from the field and had five assists. ""Obviously Luka means a lot to this team, but I try to play pickup defense and stay available for my teammates. I'm there to play hard."" Wesley Matthews scored 20 points in his first game against his former team after going to New York in Dallas' blockbuster deal with the Knicks. Matthews signed with the Pacers as a free agent. Bojan Bogdanovic led the Pacers with 22 points as Indiana lost consecutive games for the first time since the last of a season-high four straight losses on Jan. 31. Indiana had won eight of 10 coming into the game. ""It's a great home team,"" Matthews said of the Mavericks, who are playoff long shots in the Western Conference but improved to 21-10 at home. ""They do tend to make more shots at home. Couple breakdowns on the defensive end kind of get them in rhythm early."" The Mavericks were in a rhythm late too, making their last six 3-pointers in the final six minutes. That clutch stretch was capped by another shot from well behind the arc by Doncic for a 110-101 lead with 40 seconds remaining. Doncic hit the clincher in front of the Indiana bench and stared in that direction, saying after the game that an assistant coach had been talking trash throughout the game. He also had some good-natured banter with his former backcourt mate in Matthews. ""He's my guy,"" said Doncic, who was matched up with Matthews most of the game. ""He was talking a lot in the game. It was real fun."" Tim Hardaway Jr. had one of the late Dallas 3s and finished with 20 points, while Dirk Nowitzki hit one early in the fourth for a five-point lead and finished with 11 points in the 40-year-old's first home start in his record 21st season with the same franchise. Indiana's Myles Turner, a former high school standout in the Dallas area, scored 13 points. Thaddeus Young had 11.

Darren Collison (seven points, four assists) was with the Mavericks in 2012-13, while Doug McDermott (three points) spent part of last season with them. In the second quarter, the Mavericks played a video tribute to Matthews, who stood up from the Indiana huddle on the bench and waved to the fans. ""I was surprised, not with the reception, but with the tribute,"" said Matthews, who spent three-plus seasons in Dallas. ""I'm grateful for all the people here in Dallas.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  In a tight race to secure playoff spots in the Western Conference, the Utah Jazz earned a valuable tiebreaker. Utah rallied from a 17-point first-half deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 111-105 on Wednesday night. The victory gave the Jazz their second win over Los Angeles, and Utah clinched the season series and earned a playoff tiebreaker over the Clippers. ""That's a big win for us,"" Derrick Favors said. ""Everybody is so close in the standings. We need every win that we can get."" Donovan Mitchell scored 32 points to lead the Jazz, and Rudy Gobert added 20 points and 13 rebounds. Favors and Ricky Rubio chipped in 13 points apiece and Favors also collected 11 rebounds. Utah won its fourth straight home game by overcoming early shooting struggles and clamping down on defense at critical junctures. The Jazz shot just 41 percent from the field but limited the Clippers to 39 percent shooting. ""We just went dry,"" Lou Williams said. ""We missed a lot of opportunities that we usually will make, shots that we can usually make with our eyes closed."" Williams and Danilo Gallinari scored 18 points each to lead Los Angeles, and Montrezl Harrell added 16. The Clippers lost despite forcing 16 turnovers and scoring 19 points off them. After trading the lead for much of the second half, Utah pulled ahead for good with a 10-2 run late in the fourth quarter. Joe Ingles bookended the roll with two baskets to give the Jazz a 103-96 lead with 2:53 remaining. Los Angeles cut it to 109-105 on two free throws from Gallinari with 39.4 seconds left. Williams missed a 3-pointer that would have cut it to one, and Mitchell hit two free throws to secure the win. ""We didn't win the game, but it gave me a lot of confidence,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""This was a big atmosphere. And, overall, we showed up."" Los Angeles built a double-digit lead in the second quarter, going up 43-32 on a jumper from JaMychal Green, before the Jazz made a charge to erase the deficit. Utah made it 48-45 on back-to-back baskets from Mitchell and Gobert, but the Jazz couldn't draw any closer before halftime. Utah finally charged in front after Ingles buried a long jumper to cap off a third-quarter opening 11-2 run and put the Jazz up 60-58. ""They weren't feeling us early,"" Gobert said. ""They were feeling way too free. We had to pick it up. We did. We communicated better. We made everything a little harder for them."" BLOCK PARTY Gobert picked up his second foul with 2:16 left in the first quarter. With the Jazz center facing early foul trouble, Favors and Ingles stepped up defensively. Each player recorded three blocks. It marked a career-high for Ingles. As a team, Utah finished with a season-high 12 blocked shots. Their efforts helped the Jazz turn the tide defensively starting late in the first quarter. ""My mindset every game is to come out and be aggressive,"" Favors said. ""If he's in foul trouble, I just got to make sure I'm ready to go."" DISHING IT OUT Williams finished with a team-high six assists to reach 3,000 career assists.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  With Giannis Antetokounmpo watching from the bench because of a minutes restriction and Khris Middleton joining him after cramping up, Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer leaned on two other starters in overtime. Eric Bledsoe and Malcolm Brogdon were up to the task. Bledsoe scored five of his 26 points in overtime, Brogdon added 25 points and a 3-pointer late in the extra period while Milwaukee's two All-Stars rested, and the Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings 141-140 on Wednesday night. ""It builds a lot of confidence,"" Budenholzer said. ""All year we've been talking about different guys can step up and make plays. For Malcolm to make a shot, for Bled to make all the big plays he did, it speaks well for us going forward."" Bledsoe added 13 assists and 12 rebounds to help the Bucks to their sixth straight win. Middleton and Nikola Mirotic scored 21 points apiece. Milwaukee improved to an NBA-best 47-14. It's the Bucks' best record since finishing the 2000-01 season 52-30. Winning while Antetokounmpo and Middleton sat down the stretch made it sweeter for Milwaukee. ""We've got the best record in the league for a reason,"" Bledsoe said. ""Even though those are our two best players we still have a full, complete team out there playing."" Antetokounmpo scored 17 points in 25 minutes and made a pair of key baskets for Milwaukee late in the fourth quarter, but spent nearly all of overtime on the bench with a grey towel wrapped around his shoulders in his first game back from a sore right knee. He came back with 11.8 seconds remaining and made three inbounds passes but did not take a shot. ""He feels good,"" Budenholzer said. ""It's not just about the pain or what he's feeling today. It's how are we going to have him healthy, have him fresh, have him feeling good going forward. Sometimes you just have to maybe put a little money in the bank.""

Sacramento rookie Marvin Bagley III departed with a left knee strain. The second overall pick in the draft, Bagley appeared to bang knees with Brogdon while trying to go around a screen. Bagley lay on the court for several moments before being helped to his feet and taken to the locker room. ""That's definitely a cloud over our locker room,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""Was it a foul or not? I'm not going to get into whether (Brogdon) hit him or not. I wouldn't think it was a bad or dirty play at all."" Milwaukee led by 17 midway through the third but was outscored 12-4 over the final 3  1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter.

"LOS ANGELES --  Anthony Davis' first night in Los Angeles since the trade deadline started with a loud pregame ovation from Lakers fans still hoping he'll wear their team's uniform someday soon. The superstar forward ended it on the New Orleans bench while the Pelicans failed to keep up with another superstar who already made his way to Hollywood last summer. LeBron James capped his 33-point performance with a one-legged, fallaway 3-pointer with 31 seconds to play, and the Lakers weathered strong performances by Davis and Julius Randle for a 125-119 victory on Wednesday night. Davis had 22 points and eight rebounds in the first three quarters after getting a warm reception from Lakers fans who eagerly followed Los Angeles' fruitless pursuit of a trade for the forward earlier this season. But Davis sat out the fourth quarter again under the Pelicans' strange version of a minutes restriction, and James made two enormous shots in the final 2:18 to safeguard the Lakers' victory. ""It was tough not to be on the floor, especially in crunch-time situations,"" Davis said. ""But they battled. They hit some tough shots toward the end. It was just tough not being on the floor."" And though Davis heard his cheers during player introductions, he didn't return the love: ""I don't care about that."" Lakers fans are still hoping for good news this summer after their team spent several weeks attempting to make a deal for Davis, whose trade request last month threw both of these teams into upheaval. While the Pelicans were forced into a future that won't include the best player in franchise history, practically everyone on the Lakers' roster outside of James spent the next few weeks reading daily speculation about their possible departure for New Orleans in a trade. The Pelicans elected to hold onto Davis despite the Lakers' strenuous efforts, but the saga is likely to continue this summer. Until then, the Lakers will continue their pursuit of a playoff berth without Davis, who doesn't seem bothered on the court by his unclear future or his curious restrictions -- he got only 21 minutes. ""I'm actually great mentally,"" Davis added. ""I go out and play basketball. I don't let nobody steal my joy, no matter what it is."" The Pelicans elected to sit Davis for the entire game last week during the Lakers' visit to New Orleans, but the Pelicans won anyway. ""We knew playing New Orleans that we owed them a little bit of revenge because of the way they killed us there,"" said Kyle Kuzma, who scored 22 points for LA. Randle scored 35 points against his former team, but couldn't finish a comeback against James and the Lakers' new core during New Orleans' fifth loss in seven games. TIP-INS Pelicans: Frank Jackson had 15 points in his highest-scoring performance of February. ... Jrue Holiday added 19 points. ... Miller scored all of his 11 points in the fourth quarter. Lakers: Lance Stephenson limped to the locker room early in the fourth quarter and didn't return. He sprained the second toe on his left foot, but X-rays were negative. ... Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was an even bigger superstar than Davis when he demanded a trade and ended up with the Lakers in his prime, was in attendance. ... Other fans near courtside included Adam Sandler, Todd Gurley, Halsey, NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes and David Beckham, who high-fived Dean Tran after the Lakers fan hit a half-court shot to win $100,000 before the fourth quarter began. CLOSE GAME Brandon Ingram scored 23 points for the Lakers, who had a 12-point lead early in the fourth quarter before the Pelicans trimmed it to 118-117 on Darius Miller's 3-pointer with 1:38 to play. After Ingram hit a layup, Reggie Bullock forced a turnover by Holiday before James drilled that one-footed 3-pointer from the corner. ""I just trusted my mechanics, trusted my shot and gave it a chance,"" James said. Rajon Rondo had 16 assists for the Lakers, who avenged a loss in New Orleans four days earlier with just their third win in nine games overall. JULIUS RULES Randle finished two points off his career high. The big man also appeared to have words with the Lakers' coaching staff after nearly every one of his baskets, although the smiles on the Lakers assistants' faces indicated it might have been good-natured. Randle spent his first four NBA seasons with the Lakers before leaving as a free agent last summer. He already had his homecoming game at Staples on Dec. 21, getting 21 points and eight rebounds in a loss. ""It's tough, because we started so strong,"" Randle said. ""Wish we could have that (final) stretch back.""","401071594"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The short-handed Indiana Pacers overcame the absence of two keys players -- and Minnesota star Karl-Anthony Towns' fast start. Bojan Bogdanovic scored a season-high 35 points and Pacers beat the Timberwolves 122-115 on Thursday night. Towns had 42 points and 17 rebounds, scoring 23 points and grabbing seven rebounds in the first quarter. Indiana played without Domantas Sabonis (sprained left ankle), and Tyreke Evans (food poisoning). ""All we need is (who) we've got in this (locker) room,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We've been adapting, really, all season long with guys being out. Losing Victor early in the season, losing him later in the season for the year ... Our coaches do a good job of keeping guys ready to play, and they've been able to step in win games. We're still trying to establish who we are."" With the game tied at 107 with less than four minutes remaining, Bogdanovic drove for the go-ahead layup. Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins then missed two free throws on the next possession, and Bogdanovic extended the Pacers lead on the other end of the floor with a wide-open 3-pointer. The Pacers closed with a 15-8 run, with Bogdanovic scoring 11 points. ""It shows how resilient we are, how strong we are mentally,"" Bogdanovic said. ""We were short-handed without Domantas, then our big (men) early on get into foul trouble. But we did a great job at the beginning of the second quarter. Again, great effort, great team defense."" TJ Leaf added a career-high 18 points for Indiana. The Pacers overcame an early 12-point deficit and led 64-60 at halftime. ""It's rough. I mean, it's not easy to win in the NBA. And we didn't do the things we needed to do to win and execute in the end,"" Towns said. ""We just got to be better on the defensive end. We had too many miscues and it cost us."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns had his 52nd 30-plus point game and the 15th of the season. He has had 30 or more in three straight games. ... Minnesota is 4-23 when trailing after three quarters, and 41-12 when leading or tied after three.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic proved again they can beat the best of the NBA. They've also shown this week they can lose to some of the worst. Aaron Gordon had 22 points and 15 rebounds, Terrence Ross added 16 points and the Magic rallied in the final three minutes to beat the Golden State Warriors 103-96 on Thursday night. The win completes a week in which the Magic went 2-2, also beating Atlantic Division leader Toronto, but losing to the lowly New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls. ""It's complacency, we've got to beat complacency,"" Gordon said. ""We showed again tonight we're a good team, but we've got to learn to play at that level against everybody and not be complacent."" A night after they were stunned in Miami by Dwyane Wade's buzzer-beater, the Warriors blew an 11-point lead in the fourth quarter and lost for the fourth time in six games. D.J. Augustin scored 14 points and Nikola Vucevic had 12 points and 13 rebounds to help Orlando end an 11-game losing streak to the Warriors. Orlando's last win over Golden State was on Dec. 14, 2012. ""Playing up-and-down has been an issue for us all year, but we're finally showing confidence in ourselves, especially in the fourth quarter,"" Vucevic said. ""We didn't have any focus against the Knicks the other night, but we stayed with it against (the Warriors) and it paid off. We need to do that every night now."" Stephen Curry scored 33 points, but was only 1 for 6 in the fourth quarter. Klay Thompson and DeMarcus Cousins each had 21 for the Warriors, who played without Kevin Durant (rest) and Andre Iguodala (sick). Golden State was just 7 of 23 in the fourth quarter, getting outscored 33-15. The Warriors hit just 9 of 40 (22.5 percent) from behind the 3-point line in the game. Curry was 5 of 17 on 3-pointers. ""Steph is beating himself up a little bit because he knows he had a lot of open shots that didn't go,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I thought Orlando did a better job executing down the stretch than we did. I didn't think we executed very well at either end of the floor, especially in the fourth quarter."" It was the first time Golden State lost to Eastern Conference teams in back-to-back nights since March 1-2, 2013, at Boston and Philadelphia. The Warriors, who trailed by eight at halftime, outscored Orlando 30-11 in the third period, limiting the Magic to 5-of-23 shooting (21.7 percent) and forcing four turnovers to take an 81-70 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Magic roared back behind Ross, who hit three 3-pointers to ignite a 15-4 run. His last 3-pointer tied the game at 89-all with 4:16 left. Curry then fed Jordan Bell for a layup and converted an open 3-pointer to put Golden State back in front 94-89, but the lead didn't last long. The Magic ran off 10 straight points, including a 3-pointer by Gordon, who had nine points and six rebounds in the period. ""Considering the way we finished the third quarter, we were pretty much in control of the game,"" Curry said. ""But we missed a lot of shots and didn't get any stops so it's a frustrating way to end. This is a tough one."" Golden State trailed from the opening minute until Draymond Green converted a fast-break layup to give the Warriors their first lead, 65-63 midway through the third quarter. That was part of a 16-3 run sparked mostly by the defense. Curry scored 10 straight Warriors points to help Golden State to an 11-point lead by the end of the period. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State needs one more road win to assure the Warriors a winning record in road games for the sixth straight season. . Warriors are first in the NBA with 6.7 blocks per game, but had only three against Orlando. . The Warriors had their first seven games against the Southeast Division. Magic: Augustin, who had one blocked shot all season, blocked two of Curry's jump shots. . Backup PG Isaiah Briscoe returned after missing the last two games with a concussion. He had eight points and nine rebounds. . The Magic limited Golden State to just 5-of-22 shooting (22.7 percent) on 3-pointers in the first half. .

He scored 29 points in 39 minutes of Golden State's 126-125 loss Wednesday in Miami. ""He's just wiped out,"" Kerr said. ""He's been going at it hard and playing every game, so with this back-to-back made it obvious. He's earned a day off.""","401071596"
"NEW YORK --  Leading by nine points with just under four minutes remaining, it appeared that the Knicks would have company at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings. But, the Cavaliers wanted no part of that. They used a late 12-0 run to overcome their deficit and post a 125-118 victory on Thursday night. Kevin Love led the Cavs with 26 points. Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton each had 22 and Cedi Osman added 21 as Cleveland (15-47) avoided landing in the basement alongside the Knicks (13-49). ""When we're sharing the ball, it's fun to be out there,"" Sexton said. ""We were down in the fourth quarter and we all came together and said `We have to win this.' We got the `W' and that's really the most important thing."" Cleveland has now won three of its last four games, while the Knicks had their modest two-game winning streak snapped. Allonzo Trier led New York with 22 points. The Knicks led by as many as 14 early in the fourth quarter and were ahead 113-104 following Kevin Knox's jumper with 3:51 left. But Sexton's three-point play and layup brought Cleveland within 113-109. After Knox followed with two free throws, the Cavs scored the next 12 points. ""We always felt we were in the game,"" Love said. ""I told Collin he really won us the game. I thought Cedi played exceptional and JC (Clarkson) came up and hit a big shot for us. We just executed down the stretch."" New York led by nine points in the second quarter. But, a 20-10 run culminated by Ante Zizic's short hook with 3:07 left in the first half gave the Cavs their first lead, 51-50. Mitchell Robinson's alley-oop dunk gave the Knicks a 59-57 halftime lead. Dennis Smith Jr., who finished with 16 points, increased New York's lead to 97-85 on a four-point play with 3 seconds left in the third and Damyean Dotson increased the advantage to 14 by opening the final quarter with a bucket. ""Any win we get feels good. I don't care who it is against,"" said Cavs coach Larry Drew. ""With the struggles that we have had this year and what we had to deal with from an injury standpoint, being down players, any win is a good win."" Noah Vonleh finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks. Henry Ellenson scored 13 points, Robinson had 12 and Emmanuel Mudiay and Lance Thomas each scored 10. ""We totally let our foot off the gas. We got casual,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale. ""We got up 10 and decided that we weren't going to get back on defense. We got a little full of ourselves thinking that we had the game. They made us pay for it.""

DOMINATION The Cavaliers have beaten the Knicks in all three meetings this season. They have swept the season series for the third time in four years and have won 15 of the last 18 meetings between the teams. SEEKING CONSISTENCY The Knicks used the same starting lineup (Smith Jr., Dotson, Knox, Thomas, and Vonleh) for the third straight game. New York hadn't utilized the same starting five in three consecutive games since January 7-11. Only Knox and Vonleh were members of that quintet. The other starters during that stretch were Luke Kornet, Mudiay and the since-departed Tim Hardaway Jr. HITTIN' THE ROAD After playing four straight games at home, the Knicks go west for a three-game road trip which will take them to California (LA Clippers, Sacramento Kings) and Arizona (Phoenix Suns). After a quick stop back at Madison Square Garden for a rematch with the Kings, New York travels to the Midwest and Southwest for games against the Timberwolves, Pacers and Spurs.","401071597"
"HOUSTON --  After scoring 58 points, James Harden pointed to the Houston Rockets' defense and team effort. Harden also had 10 assists and seven rebounds and the Rockets overcame a 21-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Miami Heat 121-118 on Thursday night. ""We were lackadaisical on defense, especially in that second quarter,"" Harden said. ""They gained confidence and knocked down shots. They were just too comfortable, so we had to pick the pressure up in the second half, create some turnovers and energy with our defense."" He fell three points short of his career high set at New York on Jan. 23, and had the most points ever against the Heat -- breaking Willie Burton's mark of 53 for Philadelphia on Dec. 13, 1994. ""We get the stat sheet at the end of the game, and I saw he had 58,"" Rivers said. ""All of us were like, `He had that many points?' We had no idea he had that many points. That's a lot of points. He was incredible."" Harden made 8 of 18 3-pointers and was 16 of 32 overall from the field and 18 of 18 on free throws. ""I wanted to be aggressive and continue to attack the rim,"" Harden said. ""I took my shots when I had the opportunities, and not only myself, but Austin (Rivers), Gary (Clark), Chris (Paul) made some plays down the stretch. It was a total team effort tonight."" Rivers scored 17 points, and Paul and Clark each had 14 to help Houston win its fourth straight game. The Rockets shot 49 percent, including 19 of 46 on 3-pointers. Houston held Miami to 20 points in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Heat by 15 in the decisive quarter. ""I just really think it was a big win for us,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Just for a lot of reasons -- spirit wise, we did it the right way. We got into them defensively. ... This is a character win, and when you get in the playoffs, that's what counts."" Kelly Olynyk and Goran Dragic each had 21 points for Miami, Justise Winslow added 19 points and eight assists, and Josh Richardson had 18 points. The Heat shot 52 percent, making 15 of 28 3-pointers. ""We were in the driver's seat and had an opportunity to close it out and really buckle down defensively, and we started to foul,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Double-digit lead all of us a sudden you look up and they were right there. That was probably more deflating than anything."" Miami was coming off a home victory over Golden State on Wednesday night on Dwyane Wade's banked 3-pointer at the buzzer. Houston played at Charlotte on Wednesday night. With Houston down 113-103 after Dragic's 3-pointer with 6:18 remaining, Harden scored 10 points on a 14-0 run that made it 117-113. Miami had a chance to regain the lead after Paul missed a 3-pointer, but Wade missed a jumper, and Richardson missed a 3-pointer. Paul hit a jumper with 46 seconds left to finish the scoring. ""Obviously, he (Harden) had the ball a lot and his teammates made timely plays when they needed to,"" Wade said. ""They just got it going, and defensively, we weren't as good as we were early on in the game when we had that lead, and that allowed them to come back."" TIP INS Heat: James Johnson (shoulder sprain) and Hassan Whiteside (hip strain) did not play. ... Wade had 12 points, Waiters had 11 and Adebayo 10. ... The Heat outscored Houston 46-32 in the paint.

"DENVER --  Kyle Korver had the hot hand from deep and Donovan Mitchell from everywhere else. It added up to a big night in a place that's proven tough for the opposition. Mitchell scored 24 points, including six in the final two minutes, and the short-handed Utah Jazz ended Denver's nine-game home win streak by holding off the Nuggets 111-104 on Thursday. Korver hit six 3-pointers on his way to 22 points as the Jazz showed plenty of energy despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back and with two of their guards out of the lineup. Utah led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter, only to see the lead trimmed to five with 8:41 remaining. Korver helped the Jazz on a 13-0 run to gain some separation and send them to their third straight victory. ""We thrive on moments like this,"" Mitchell said. ""I think that's a testament to our character as a team."" Jamal Murray and Will Barton each had 21 points for Denver. All-Star big man Nikola Jokic dealt with foul trouble but still finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. A Nuggets win would've vaulted them into first place in the Western Conference after a Golden State loss earlier in the night. But they were done in by their long-range woes, shooting 28 percent from 3-point range. It was Denver's first loss at the Pepsi Center since Jan. 15. ""I thought our defense was really, really great,"" Korver said, ""and probably won us the game."" The Jazz wore their colorful uniforms with some players accessorizing with brightly colored shoes. Joe Ingles went with red sneakers, Mitchell salmon, Derrick Favors red and Royce O'Neale green/yellow. But it was their play that stood out. Ingles had 15 points and 10 assists, while Favors added 15 points and 11 rebounds. After a fourth-quarter spurt, the Jazz led 97-79 with 6:17 remaining. Denver mounted one final rally and cut it to three on a 3-pointer by Paul Millsap with 1:14 left, before Mitchell took over to wrap things up. ""Through everything we went through in that game, after everything, I mean, we came back and fought,"" Murray said. ""That shows how good we are."" Utah turned up the defensive intensity in the first half, forcing the Nuggets into 10 turnovers and 1-of-13 shooting from 3-point range. That, coupled with the play of Ingles (12 points in the opening half) and Thabo Sefolosha (nine in the second quarter alone) allowed the Jazz to take a 52-37 lead into the locker room. The 37 points were a season-low in a first half for Denver. ""We know they're a great team,"" Mitchell said. ""We just tried to find a way to make it difficult for all those guys to get those shots."" TIP-INS Jazz: Guards Ricky Rubio and Raul Neto were both out with left hamstring tightness. Rubio left Wednesday's win over the Los Angeles Clippers in the third quarter. Nuggets: F Trey Lyles missed a fourth straight game with a strained left hamstring. ... Denver missed 10 straight 3-pointers before Murray connected in the second quarter. ... Denver is 8-2 against the Northwest Division -- both losses to Utah. ... Barton had 13 rebounds. FAT LIP Center Rudy Gobert took an accidental elbow to the mouth from teammate Grayson Allen late in the first half. Gobert appeared to have a cut on his lip, but stayed in the game. Moments later, Gobert countered with a ferocious dunk. He trails only Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo in dunks this season. Gobert finished with 16 points and four blocks. ""Rudy Gobert, hell of a defensive player,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. TOUGH TO COVER Korver and Mitchell combined for 10 3-pointers, including one at the buzzer by Mitchell to end the third quarter. As a team, Denver had seven. ""We have to be a little bit more disciplined with who we're guarding and the situation they're in,"" Malone said. PATIENCE Guard Isaiah Thomas played just 11 minutes and had four points as he works his way back from a hip surgery. ""He's trying to find that rhythm and get comfortable with the ball in his hands,"" Malone said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Philadelphia 76ers looked pretty good for a team that claims to be still figuring things out. Good enough to end a 19-game losing streak to the Thunder. Tobias Harris scored 32 points and Ben Simmons had a triple-double to help the 76ers beat Oklahoma City 108-104 on Thursday night, ending the NBA's longest active winning streak by one team over another. Harris, acquired earlier in February in a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers, posted his highest point total in eight games with the 76ers. Philadelphia needed his offense because center Joel Embiid, the league's No. 6 scorer, missed his fourth straight game with left knee soreness. The 76ers did fine, dropping 33 assists on 42 baskets. Harris thinks they might have actually overdone it with the passing at times. ""There were a couple plays there in the fourth quarter where we could have made the simple play and we would have been fine with,"" Harris said. ""But I think as a `we' team, we're just trying to feel each other out and make extra passes. Sometimes tonight, I felt we should have went for the easier play. It's not bad, though."" Philadelphia won in Oklahoma City for the first time. The 76ers' last victory had been at home in 2008 in the Thunder's first visit after moving from Seattle. Simmons finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists for his ninth triple-double of the season. Russell Westbrook posted his 25th triple-double of the season with 23 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, but he made 8 of 24 shots. Jerami Grant added 23 points for the Thunder, who lost their third straight. Thunder forward Paul George, the league's No. 2 scorer, sat out with soreness in his right shoulder. Thunder coach Billy Donovan said before the game that George was injured during a loss at Denver on Tuesday night. The 76ers led by 16 in the first half and were up 60-49 at the break. ""I thought we got some good looks, we just didn't shoot the ball particularly well in the first half,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought when we played closer to the basket on post-ups, that helped us get back into the game."" The Thunder cut their deficit down to two late in the third, but the 76ers handled the surge and led 86-79 heading into the fourth. The 76ers led by two with 2.1 seconds left and barely got the ball inbounds. JJ Redick made two free throws with 1.5 seconds remaining to put the game out of reach. ""We're getting there,"" Harris said. ""Obviously, there's still time. There's things that we've still got to work on. But there were some really good spurts out there on the floor with us playing the right way."" TIP-INS 76ers: Grant, who started his career in Philadelphia, made 10 of 17 shots and had six rebounds. ... Jonah Bolden, a rookie from Australia, matched a season high with 14 points on 6-of-7 shooting. Thunder: Free agent pickup Markieff Morris got his first start with the Thunder. It was just his fourth game with Oklahoma City. He finished with 17 points in 19 minutes. ... It was the 129th triple-double of Westbrook's career. STAT LINES Westbrook went 1 for 9 from 3-point range. He entered the night shooting 27 percent from deep for the season. ""He's great downhill,"" Simmons said.

HE SAID IT Thunder guard Dennis Schroder on if the Thunder are worried about their losing streak: ""Hell no. We're in the third spot. We didn't have P (George), who is the MVP in my opinion this season. We had people step up from the bench. When we play the right way, ain't nobody can beat us."" OUCH!

"ATLANTA -- Lauri Markkanen made three free throws to give Chicago the lead for good late in the fourth overtime, and the Bulls overcame Trae Young's career-high 49 points to beat the Hawks 168-161 in the third-highest-scoring game in NBA history. The 329 combined points trailed only the 370 scored by the Pistons and Nuggets in triple overtime in December 1983 and the 337 from the Bucks and Spurs in March 1982. Markkanen finished with 31 points and 17 rebounds. He snapped a 159-all tie by making three free throws after he was fouled by Alex Len. ""I've never been a part of a game that long,"" said Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who finished with a career-high 47 points. ""I air-balled one because I was so damn tired."" Young, the rookie who played almost 56 minutes, had his third straight game of setting or matching his career scoring high after back-to-back games with 36 points. He added 16 assists, 8 rebounds and 9 turnovers. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Young is the first rookie with 120 points in a three-game span since Allen Iverson in April 1997. His stat line put Young in a rare class. He is one of four players in NBA history to have put up at least 45 points, 10 assists and 5 rebounds in a game as a rookie. He also became the first rookie to have a 45-point, 10-assist game since Michael Jordan did so on Jan. 26, 1985. ""That was a fun game to play in. Probably one of the most fun games I've played in my career,"" Young said. ""I'm proud of the way we fought even though we came up short."" Young and DeAndre' Bembry had turnovers in the final 30 seconds of the third overtime, preventing the Hawks from an opportunity to snap a 155-all tie. Ryan Arcidiacono's 3-pointer forced the third overtime. LaVine's 3-pointer gave Chicago a 139-138 lead with 1:31 remaining in the first overtime. Following Young's errant pass for a turnover, Wayne Selden made one of two free throws to increase the lead to two points. Young's tiebreaking, step-back 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds remaining in regulation forced the first overtime. The rookie's last-second layup tied it at 140 to force the second overtime. Chicago led 99-88 early in the fourth period before Atlanta rallied. Young's steal and basket sparked a string of 11 straight points for a 121-116 lead. The Bulls have the NBA's youngest roster, with an average age of 24.1 years. The Hawks made their own statement about youth by starting three rookies. Omari Spellman moved into the lineup as the third rookie, joining Young and Kevin Huerter. However, it was the Hawks' oldest player, Vince Carter, who logged the second-most minutes on the team. At 42, Carter is the oldest player in NBA history to play at least 45 minutes in a game. ""You know, I don't know if Vince is getting younger or what, but he's had just unbelievable games this year,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""He's just a remarkable example of what our young guys should be and see."" Hawks forward John Collins, who scored 34 points in an overtime win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, was held out because of flu-like symptoms. Collins was told to rest at home as the team tried to protect other players from becoming ill. Spellman started for Collins but didn't return after he was helped to the locker room with a sprained left ankle late in the third quarter. There was a delay with 8:49 remaining when Huerter had a hard fall under the Bulls' basket and didn't immediately return to his feet. Huerter walked off the court without assistance and returned to the game. Otto Porter Jr. had 31 points and 10 rebounds for Chicago. Len had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Dewayne Dedmon had 14 points and 12 rebounds. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"NEW YORK --  Frank Kaminsky was told Friday the opportunity he wanted was finally going to come. Charlotte coach James Borrego hadn't make Kaminsky part of his rotation for much of this season, but that was going to change, at least for one night. ""He told me today just to compete. Help us on offense. Defend. Rebound. Do the things you know how to do,"" Kaminsky said. ""I just tried to do that."" He did just what the Hornets needed in a game they really needed to have. Kemba Walker scored 25 points, Jeremy Lamb added 22 and Charlotte snapped a three-game skid with a 123-112 victory over the Brooklyn Nets to inch back ahead of Orlando for eighth place in the Eastern Conference. Kaminsky had played in just 26 games, but Borrego figured the 7-footer's passing ability would be helpful against the zone defense the Nets like to employ. ""Frank gives us a different dimension offensively and I think we saw the effects of that tonight,"" Borrego said. Nicolas Batum had 17 points and Kaminsky re-emerged after sitting out the last four games to score 15. The Hornets put seven players in double figures and shot 53 percent from the field. D'Angelo Russell scored 22 points for the sixth-place Nets, who were easily beaten for the second time in three nights at home, where they have now lost four of five. DeMarre Carroll had 20 points. ""We have given up 68 points in the first half two games in a row. It starts on the defensive end,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It's not about the lineups or working guys back in from injury. It's about defense and we have to do a better job on that end. Right now, we just aren't getting it done."" The Nets had won in Charlotte last Saturday behind a career high-tying 40 points from Russell, and the Hornets followed that by falling to Western Conference powers Golden State and Houston. But they took charge of this game with a 17-2 run in the second quarter that turned a one-point game into a 62-46 cushion that really was never threatened much. And when the Nets finally did get it into single digits in the fourth quarter, Batum scored eight straight Charlotte points as the Hornets regained control. The Nets shot 51 percent but were woeful defensively, just as when they trailed by as many as 28 in a 125-116 loss to Washington on Wednesday. ""We can't dig ourselves in holes and expect to get out of it by us scoring,"" Russell said. ""We got to get stops."" Brooklyn led 32-31 after one, but Charlotte then made 16 of 26 shots (61.5 percent) while outscoring the Nets 37-18 in the second. Walker had a couple layups in a 9-0 run that extended a one-point lead to 54-44, and after a Nets basket the Hornets quickly answered with an 8-0 spurt, extending it to 62-46 on Lamb's layup. The lead grew to 21 in the third quarter and even when the Nets finally got untracked late in the period and early in the fourth, they never stopped the Hornets enough to make any serious dent in the deficit.

HAPPY AS A HORNET Despite his difficult season, Kaminsky said he wanted to remain in Charlotte, where he was a first-round pick in 2015. He denied a report that he wanted to be bought out by Friday's deadline to be eligible to sign with another team and be eligible for the playoffs. ""It's been a tough season, a lot of reports and stuff has come out, but none of that has been said by me,"" Kaminsky said.","401071602"
"TORONTO --  One day after the Toronto Raptors practiced ""game-winning shots,"" Kawhi Leonard made one against the Portland Trail Blazers. Leonard scored the go-ahead basket with three seconds remaining and the Raptors held on to beat the Trail Blazers 119-117 Friday night. Toronto won it when Leonard used a screen by Kyle Lowry to drive against Portland's Damian Lillard, then rose over his smaller opponent for the decisive basket. ""We just practiced that exact scenario yesterday,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""It was great. Kyle sets a screen and we try to get the smaller guy so (Leonard) can just vault up over him and shoot."" Toronto had run the same play moments earlier, with Lowry making a layup. When the play was called again, Leonard was more interested in keeping the ball himself. ""I was looking to get baseline,"" Leonard said. ""That first time I had seen I could be a little bit more aggressive and that's what I did the second time down."" Leonard scored 38 points and Lowry had 19 points and 10 assists as the Raptors won for the ninth time in 10 games. Toronto is an NBA-best 11-4 in games decided by three points or fewer. ""Just staying composed and understanding that situations aren't always going to be perfect,"" Lowry said. Marc Gasol scored 19 points and Pascal Siakam had 16 for Toronto, which has won four straight home meetings with Portland and seven of the past eight overall. C.J. McCollum scored 35 points and matched a career best by making seven 3-pointers, but it wasn't enough to extend Portland's season-best five-game winning streak. Lillard scored 24 points and Jake Layman had 13 as the Trail Blazers suffered their first lost after winning four straight to begin a seven-game trip. ""Obviously it's disappointing to lose but I like the way we competed,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Ahead 93-84 to begin the fourth, the Raptors missed nine consecutive field goal attempts, allowing Portland to close to within one, 95-94, on a 3-pointer by Lillard at 6:47. Leonard ended Toronto's drought with a layup, but the Raptors couldn't hold the lead, and Lillard tied it 103-all with another 3 at 3:27. Lillard made another tying 3 with 13 seconds left, but Leonard won it with his baseline jumper. ""The ball hit every part of the rim,"" Lillard said. ""That took time off. If it had gone straight in, it almost would have been better."" By the time Portland inbounded the ball, there was barely enough time for a full-court heave. The Raptors connected on 11 of 17 shots in the first quarter and led 31-24 after one. Leonard scored 10 points in the second and Toronto led 61-54 at halftime. McCollum scored 14 points in the third but the Raptors responded with five 3-pointers, taking a 93-84 lead into the fourth. ""They had an answer every time,"" Lillard said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Slowed by foul trouble, C Jusuf Nurkic did not attempt a shot in five first-half minutes. ... Portland is 18-5 against Eastern Conference opponents. ... The Trail Blazers are 0-15 on the road when trailing through three quarters. Raptors: Toronto had nine assists on 11 made baskets in the first. ... The Raptors made their final six shots of the game. ... Lowry has had at least 10 assists in three straight games. MAKING HIS MARC Gasol's 19 points were his most with Toronto. He also had six assists and eight rebounds. ""He was really good tonight,"" Nurse said. ""It looked like all of a sudden the rust was gone."" LONG DIVISION Portland lost for the first time in nine games against Atlantic Division opponents. Toronto, which is 9-0 against the Pacific Division, is the only NBA team with an unbeaten record against a single division. BORDER BLUES Portland center Enes Kanter did not travel to Toronto with the team. An outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Kanter's Turkish passport was revoked in 2017, and Turkish prosecutors have accused Kanter of membership in a terror organization. While playing for the Knicks earlier this season, Kanter did not accompany the team for a game in London because he feared he could be killed over his opposition to Erdogan.","401071603"
"BOSTON --  Some late defense helped the Boston Celtics snap a four-game losing streak. Kyrie Irving had 13 points and 12 assists, Al Horford scored 18 points and the Celtics shut down the Washington Wizards in the fourth quarter in a 107-96 victory Friday night. Boston won for the first time since the All-Star break to avoid its first five-game skid in more than four years. The Celtics held Washington without a point for a stretch of more than forced the Wizards into seven turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""Tonight was fun for everybody. You could see that,"" said Marcus Smart, who had 16 points. ""Tonight the ball was popping. It was moving. We made every right play."" Marcus Morris added 17 points and nine rebounds, and Jaylen Brown added 13 points. Boston held Washington scoreless for more than four minutes in the fourth quarter, when the Wizards committed seven of their 18 turnovers. ""That one stretch of defense separated the game and that was fun to see,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Bradley Beal had 29 points and 11 rebounds for the Wizards, and Tomas Satoransky and Jeff Green each had 15 points. Washington had a 53-46 rebounding advantage, but couldn't overcome the turnovers and a cold stretch in the fourth quarter. ""Turnovers were the difference. I thought we actually played a really solid defensive game against a team that's loaded with a lot of talent,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""We game them so many easy opportunities."" The Wizards lost for the fifth time in six games. Jabari Parker hit a 3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer to pull the Wizards to 82-81, then opened the fourth with a 16-foot jumper. The lead didn't last long. After shooting 62.5 percent (15 for 24) in the third quarter, Washington opened the fourth 3 for 11 and went 4:21 without scoring. Brown scored five points during a 9-3 run that put Boston up 91-86. DEFENSIVE RETURNS Boston's defense kept the Wizards off balance through much of the fourth quarter. Washington was just 6 for 20 in the fourth quarter, getting outscored 16-8 over the final seven minutes. ""We needed to get back to this -- making guys really shaky with the ball, questioning bringing the ball up against us. Just imposing our will,"" Smart said. ""We did that tonight and that helped us a lot. We have to continue that from here on out."" SKID ENDS Boston won for the first time since beating Detroit 118-110 on Feb. 13. ""I just was happy to see the effort from everyone. Guys were diving on the floor, really getting after it,"" Horford said. TIP-INS Wizards: Entered the game three games back of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. ... Beal had 10 points in the first quarter to account for half of Washington's scoring. ... Beal averaged 30.9 points in February while shooting 52.2 percent from the field. ... The Wizards didn't get a field goal until Beal's dunk with 6:16 left in the first quarter.

"PHOENIX --  Whatever New Orleans Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry said to Julius Randle at halftime worked. Randle scored 16 of his 22 points in the third quarter, leading the Pelicans to a 130-116 win over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. ""I encouraged him in a different way,"" Gentry said with a laugh. ""We have to rely on ball movement and people movement. That's when we're at our best."" Jrue Holiday scored 21 points, E'Twaun Moore added 20 and Anthony Davis, on a team-imposed playing-time restriction, had 17 points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes. The Pelicans snapped a two-game skid. Devin Booker scored 26 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 19 and Deandre Ayton 16 as the Suns lost their first game after ending a 17-game skid. The Pelicans took control in the third quarter and led for all but 1:13 of the second half. Booker hit a 3-pointer with 2:18 remaining as Phoenix closed within 119-112, but the Pelicans scored the next eight points. ""We just came out with a lack of focus, a lack of energy from the start of the game,"" Randle said. ""It just wasn't good, so we just tried to lock in for that second half and play like we know how to play."" The Suns led by as many as 11 in the first quarter. The Pelicans cut the lead to two, 34-32, but Phoenix hit four 3-pointers in the first five minutes of the second quarter -- two each for De'Anthony Melton and Troy Daniels off the bench -- to take a 48-38 lead. Moore made a 3 that cut the Suns' lead to 54-53 with 1:15 left in the first half, but Phoenix carried a 57-56 lead into halftime. Davis scored 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting in 13 minutes of the first half. The Pelicans took their first lead of the game 42 seconds into the second half, 58-57, when Davis hit an 11-foot jumper. They went on an 11-0 run early in the third quarter and took a 77-66 lead. ""A lot of good shots. A lot of good wide open shots,"" Holiday said. ""To be able to play together and get wide open, good shots makes the game easy."" The Suns trailed by as many as 12 in the third, before Booker scored a vicious one-handed dunk over Davis that got the fans out of their seats and made it 80-74. But Booker said energy was lacking. ""Just a vibe,"" he said. ""On the court, it wasn't there."" Davis left the game for good with 3:29 left in the quarter, and the Pelicans rebuilt their lead. Holiday's 3-pointer with 1:32 left made it 92-81 for New Orleans. ""We felt that all of the work we did, we only had a one-point lead (at halftime),"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""We didn't open the third quarter well. It was a wake-up call for them. They just put it in next gear and we couldn't match that."" TIP-INS PELICANS: Davis heard boos from the Phoenix crowd when at the foul line in the second quarter. He requested a trade in late January, but was not dealt. ... Former Phoenix player Elfrid Payton had eight points and 10 assists. ... The Pelicans made 16 of 27 3-point attempts. SUNS: F Josh Jackson heard a few derisive whistles from the crowd when checking in for the first time in the first quarter. Jackson was fined by the Suns for a violation of team rules on Thursday, after reportedly missing a scheduled autograph session. He was also heckled when he missed a dunk. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Clippers finally gained some ground in the crowded Western Conference playoff race, although coach Doc Rivers knows it's still too early to make much of it. If nothing else, Rivers realizes his squad has an important tiebreaker against Sacramento after dealing a serious blow to the Kings' bid at ending the NBA's longest active playoff drought. Landry Shamet scored eight of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, Lou Williams made two free throws with 7.9 seconds left and the Clippers held off the Kings 116-109 on Friday night. Danilo Gallinari had 19 points and nine rebounds, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 and Ivica Zubac added 10 points and 10 rebounds to help the Clippers complete a season sweep of the Kings in a game that was critical for both teams' postseason hopes. ""This was an important game for sure,"" Shamet said. ""You pay attention to the playoff standings, where teams are. You don't want to look too far ahead but they're right with us. Definitely the playoff race adds motivation."" Los Angeles moved a half-game ahead of San Antonio for seventh place in the West. Sacramento, which has lost four of five since the All-Star break, is two games behind the Spurs for the final postseason spot in the conference. ""Our guys responded to their runs,"" Rivers said. ""They had the lead at halftime and guys just kept playing. They played the game like they were going to win the game. That was on their mind. They didn't know how we were going to win but they wanted to win and we played like that."" It wasn't easy. The Kings trimmed a 13-point deficit to 110-107 with 1:16 remaining following back-to-back dunks from Harrison Barnes and Cauley-Stein. Williams made a short jumper then added two free throws after De'Aaron Fox scored on a layup. Montrezl Harrell added a pair of free throws with 1.5 seconds left. The Clippers have won nine straight against the Kings, including all four matchups this season. That gives Los Angeles a critical advantage should the teams finish the regular season in a tie. Shamet thought the playoff atmosphere of this game will help the Clippers prepare for the stretch run. ""You don't ever want to be comfortable,"" he said. ""If you can build that mentality now, especially at the end of the season going into the playoffs and then you already have it at that point, it's definitely an advantage."" Buddy Hield had 23 points for Sacramento. Fox added 12 points and 12 assists, and Willie Cauley-Stein had 16 points and 12 rebounds. ""They have been a tough team for us and a tough matchup for us all year,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They got a lot of loose balls and it seems like we didn't make a lot of shots. They just made more plays."" Neither team gained much of an advantage during a back-and-forth first half. The Clippers led by 10 midway through the first quarter but Harry Giles made back-to-back shots and Hield added three free throws to put the Kings ahead 56-52 at halftime. TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles grabbed a season-high 58 rebounds and improved to 27-5 when beating opponents on the boards. . The Clippers had seven players score in double figures. . Zubac's double-double was his fifth of the season. ... Wilson Chandler sat out his ninth game with a quad injury. Kings: Giles had 15 points off the bench on 7-of-13 shooting. ... Rookie forward Marvin Bagley III will be sidelined indefinitely with a left knee strain sustained during Wednesday's 141-140 loss to Milwaukee. Bagley, the second pick in last year's draft, underwent an MRI that was negative. He will be re-evaluated within the next two weeks. STREAKING IN SACRAMENTO The Clippers have won 13 straight games in Sacramento dating to 2013, a franchise record for most consecutive road wins against one team. LOU TIME Williams scored 17 points in 28 minutes, 10 coming in the fourth quarter. Williams led the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring last season and is second this season behind Houston star James Harden. ""Fourth-quarter Lou, that's basically what he was tonight,"" Rivers said. ""He didn't have his rhythm but he found it when we needed it at the end of the game.""","401071606"
"LOS ANGELES --  Eric Bledsoe began the day with a contract extension. He ended it leading the Milwaukee Bucks to their eighth consecutive victory and 10th in a row on the road. Bledsoe scored 31 points, Malcolm Brogdon added 21 points, and the Bucks beat the Los Angeles Lakers 131-120 on Friday night. ""We've got a talented young team, we're growing together,"" said Bledsoe, who reportedly received a $70 million, four-year extension. ""We compete for something bigger than ourselves. I just wanted to be part of it."" The NBA's best team had its hands full for much of the fourth quarter, when the game was tied six times over the final seven minutes. ""We've been doing it all season. Team's going to run, we keep our composure and make our run,"" Bledsoe said. Bledsoe's basket tied it for the last time at 118-all. That launched a game-ending 15-2 run with all but four of the points scored by Bledsoe and Brogdon. ""Everybody talks about Giannis (Antetokounmpo),"" LeBron James said, ""but it's the supporting cast. They've surrounded Giannis with a great cast."" Antetokounmpo was held to 16 points -- below his 27-point average -- and 15 rebounds for Milwaukee. ""When the season started we knew we had something special and had a great team, but to be honest with you I never thought we'd have the best record in the NBA,"" he said. ""We've worked hard for it, we've played every game, go out there, show up every game, try to win every game."" The Lakers got after the Bucks defensively for the first three quarters, but had three of their nine turnovers in the final five minutes, including two by Rajon Rondo. ""We had our chances,"" James said. ""We broke down individually down the stretch defensively."" Brandon Ingram and James scored 31 points each. James had 10 assists. Rondo added 20 points. James and Rondo combined to score 15 straight points during a stretch in the fourth that drew the Lakers to a 113-all tie. But Los Angeles scored just seven points the rest of the game. ""For some reason we kind of fell apart at the end,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""One thing we did a poor job of was defending Bledsoe and Brogdon. We couldn't keep them in front of us."" Ingram powered the Lakers to their largest lead of the game, 79-67, with eight of their first 14 points to open the third. He had a highlight one-handed dunk over 7-foot Brook Lopez that brought the Lakers' bench to its feet. Ingram and James had 10 points each in the quarter. From there, the Bucks closed on a 26-15 run, including nine by Bledsoe, to trail 94-93 going into the fourth. ""We were kind of on life support there for a lot of the first half, going into halftime and going into the third quarter,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We caught a good wave there and Bled was a huge part of it."" The Lakers outscored the Bucks 15-9, with six by Kyle Kuzma, to end the first half leading 65-59. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo played 32 minutes without restriction after sitting out with right knee soreness on Monday at Chicago and being limited to 24 minutes on Wednesday at Sacramento. ... They've won four in a row against LA. ... They improved their NBA-best marks to 48-14 overall and 23-9 on the road.

"CLEVELAND --  Due to an arena-wide computer glitch, there were still several seconds remaining on the scoreboard clock when the officials signaled the game was over. The Pistons ended it much earlier. Luke Kennard scored 26 points, Reggie Jackson added 24 and Detroit made sure it didn't have a letdown against a depleted Cleveland team as the Pistons built a 33-point lead in the first half and rolled to a 129-93 win Saturday over the Cavaliers, who were without star forward Kevin Love. After coach Dwane Casey said he wanted his group to play ""as a desperate team"" while pushing toward the playoffs, Detroit came out flying. The Pistons, who entered holding the No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference, scored 42 in the first quarter while taking a 71-38 halftime lead.  The score could have been more lopsided, but the officials convened at halftime and took away a basket by Detroit. It may have been Cleveland's best defensive stop of the night. ""We put together a really solid game, offensively, defensively,"" said Blake Griffin, who had 14 points, nine assists and seven rebounds in 26 minutes. ""The ball was moving. We played the right brand of basketball. I know I keep saying that, but we've been on a much better streak regardless of wins or losses."" Andre Drummond had 13 points and 10 rebounds and got some extra rest for the Pistons, who play at Toronto on Sunday. Rookie Collin Sexton scored 14 for the Cavs. Cleveland was again missing Love, who was rested while he continues to build up strength following a foot surgery that sidelined him for 50 games earlier this season. Love isn't ready to play in consecutive games, and with the Cavs hosting Orlando on Sunday, the team sat him. Even Love wouldn't have helped much. His absence, along with big men Tristan Thompson (foot) and Ante Zizic (concussion) both being out, left Cleveland vulnerable inside and Detroit took advantage. The Pistons did whatever they pleased on offense, getting easy looks in the lane and behind the arc. ""They came out and punched us in the mouth early,"" Cavs forward Larry Nance said. Jackson scored 12 points in the first quarter on 5-of-5 shooting, making a pair of 3-pointers as the Pistons began pulling away. Kennard picked it up from there. He scored 14 in the second half, draining a 29-foot 3-pointer in the fourth quarter to put Detroit ahead 103-72. ""The one was deep,"" Kennard said. ""I was kind of surprised it went in. It felt good."" Nearby, teammate Langston Galloway warned reporters to be careful around the hot-shooting Kennard. ""Back up,"" he joked. ""You'll catch on fire."" TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond has reached double-digits in points and rebounds in 14 straight games. ... Detroit has made at least 12 3-pointers in 11 straight, extending the franchise record. ... Came in averaging 107 points, their highest average since 1987-88. Cavaliers: Sexton missed his first seven field-goal tries and finished 3 of 13. ... Thompson has missed 18 straight games. ... Zizic remains in concussion protocol. He was injured in Thursday's win at New York. ... Cleveland had won its previous four home games against Detroit by at least 17. STEP BACK The Cavs have been without Love for much of the season, but Nance said that's doesn't excuse for selfishness. ""Not pleased with it from top to bottom,"" he said. ""It's easy to point fingers and blame one another. That's certainly what I thought we did. There was whole lot of finger pointing. I thought we took a step back, even without Kev. That shouldn't have been a 40-point game. ""We gotta look in the mirror tonight and come back tomorrow with a better attitude."" FRYE'S GOODBYE Cavs forward Channing Frye said his decision to retire after this season was easy. Family first. ""The straw that broke the camel's back, I was on vacation,"" explained Frye, who announced Friday on Twitter that he intends to stop playing after his 13th NBA season. ""I went to Puerto Rico with my kids and I saw our best friends who live down there and their kids are 12, 11, 10. My son is eight now. I'm like, `I want to go his practice and not have to worry about my practice.' I want to make time for them."" The 35-year-old Frye, who played on Cleveland's title team in 2016, hopes to be remembered for his honesty. ""By being real, whether it was goofy or rude or brash, whatever it is, just know that I was me all the time, I tried to be,"" he said. ... I met some amazing guys.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Orlando Magic are becoming more confident by the day. Nikola Vucevic scored 27 points, Terrence Ross added 23 and the surging Magic continued their push for a playoff berth with a 117-112 win over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. Evan Fournier finished with 19 points, eight assists and five rebounds for Orlando, which shot 51 percent from the field. The Magic are 10-3 in their last 13 games and improved to 30-34, a half-game ahead of Charlotte for eighth place in the Eastern Conference. Orlando last qualified for the playoffs in 2012. Coming off a home win against defending league champion Golden State, coach Steve Clifford's crew suffered no letdown. ""Right now we're playing for something, man,"" Ross said. ""It's getting fun."" Bojan Bogadnovic scored 25 points and Darren Collison finished with 23 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who shot 55 percent. After Indiana closed within 114-112 with 29.7 seconds left, Orlando worked the shot clock down before Fournier hit a game-sealing 3-pointer from the right wing with 8.4 seconds left. ""You rarely get to the rim late in the game,"" Fournier said. ""I was just trying to clear space. I wasn't thinking about anything. I knew a jump shot was coming. It felt good. It's the most enjoyable thing you can have in basketball: hit a clutch shot and then win the game."" The Pacers pulled within four points when Collison hit a 3-pointer with 35 seconds left. Orlando raced to a 10-0 lead before Indiana steadied itself and tied the score at 27-all at the end of the first quarter. The Pacers weren't sluggish for too long. Coming off a 35-assist night in a win over Minnesota, Indiana racked up 18 more on the way to a 60-55 halftime lead. The Pacers pushed their lead to 10 points in the third, but the Magic scored on five of their final seven possessions and closed within 87-83 entering the fourth quarter. ""We've got to get back to calm in big situations,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said, ""especially the fourth quarter where emotions are high."" That's when Ross heated up. He hit a 3-pointer that gave Orlando a 107-102 lead with 4:08 to go. With 1:34 left, Ross drew a three-shot foul and made all the free throws for a 114-107 advantage. ""(Ross) has five points, and then the `Human Torch' changes the whole game,"" Fournier said. ""He was a huge spark. He comes out of nowhere.""

"MIAMI --  Getting big leads hasn't been a problem lately for the Miami Heat. Keeping them, however, has been an enormous issue. That is, until Saturday. Kelly Olynyk scored 25 points, Derrick Jones Jr. added 18 off the bench and the Heat never trailed on the way to easily topping the Brooklyn Nets 117-88. ""We needed that. We needed to keep that lead,"" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. ""Obviously, at this time of the year everyone has games coming rapidly. You don't always want to be in a fourth-quarter battle."" Rodney McGruder scored 17, Justise Winslow added 13 points and Josh Richardson added 12 for the Heat. Bam Adebayo grabbed 16 rebounds for Miami -- giving him three more than the entire Brooklyn starting lineup had combined. The Heat were without Goran Dragic (left calf strain) and Hassan Whiteside (left hip strain). James Johnson, who has been out with a sprained shoulder, was in uniform but did not play. ""We haven't had many games like this all year,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Actually, none. The 29-point margin was Miami's largest win of the season, and Brooklyn's largest loss. Brooklyn remained No. 6 in the Eastern Conference race, percentage points ahead of No. 7 Detroit. Miami remained No. 10 in the East, a game behind No. 8 Orlando and No. 9 Charlotte. ""Tonight we were searching for everything -- offense, defense, rebounding, just Miami was unbelievable,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Give them a lot of credit. I think they dominated us in every fashion."" Joe Harris scored 15 and Rodions Kurucs scored 11 for Brooklyn, which has dropped 10 of its last 15 games. D'Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie each scored 10 for the Nets. It's the first time Miami has won back-to-back home games since Jan. 10 and 12. The Heat haven't had a three-game home winning streak this season. Miami led 54-44 at the half, and pushed the lead out to 20 for the first time with about 4 minutes left in the third when Jones muscled in a left-handed layup. And this time, a big lead wasn't problematic. The Heat wasted double-digit leads in each of their last four games before Saturday -- 11 in what became a blowout loss to Detroit, 13 in a close loss to Phoenix, 24 against Golden State (the game where Wade hit the miracle buzzer-beater for the win) and 21 on Thursday in a loss to Houston. But this time, they finished the job. The lead was 84-64 going into the fourth, and it stayed one-sided the rest of the way. ""They had more intensity,"" Brooklyn's Caris LeVert said. ""They played a lot better defense than we did. Our defense, again, wasn't up to par and it definitely showed in the score, the stat sheet, and just watching the game as well."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn left a game below the .500 mark for the first time since Jan. 14, when it was 22-23. ... The Nets had won each of their last three games in Miami. ... It's been a season of wild swings for the Nets -- they started 8-18, then went 19-5, and are 5-10 since. Heat: This game started a stretch during which Miami will play seven of eight at home. ... Wade was a very rare 0 for 6 in the first quarter -- the third-worst opening-period shooting effort of his career. He was 0 for 7 twice, once in 2006 and once in 2016, and finished with nine points after making four of his final five shots. ... Udonis Haslem got first-quarter minutes at home for the first time since Dec. 22, 2017. WADE BLOCKADE Wade has 1,050 blocked shots in his career -- counting regular-season and playoff games. That has him one shy of matching Michael Jordan's all-time block mark for guards. Jordan still has the regular-season record of 893, with Wade at 875 when not factoring in postseason games. Wade has the playoff-record for guards, at 175. EAST MESS The gap in the East standings between No. 6 Brooklyn and No. 10 Miami is now down to just 2 1/2 games.","401071610"
"Sccop Jackson looks at the possibility and anticipation of the 76ers going up against the Warriors in the NBA Finals, a chance for Philly to dethrone a dynasty. (1:41) PHILADELPHIA --  Stephen Curry shook off foul trouble to score 28 points and spark the Golden State Warriors down the stretch of a 120-117 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Curry seemed invisible in long stretches, especially in the third when he played just 3:45 of the quarter and watched the 76ers keep competitive in his absence. With Curry back in the lineup in the fourth, the Warriors squashed Philly's upset bid in front of a sellout crowd that included plenty of Philadelphia Eagles and the first appearances of Philadelphia Phillies Bryce Harper jerseys. Curry buried a 3-pointer for a 111-109 lead, the Sixers tied it, then Curry scored the next six points over the final 2:35 of the game to do what he does best -- carry the Warriors in the clutch. The Sixers had one last shot to at least tie but lost the ball out of bounds with 1.7 seconds Kevin Durant scored 34 points and DeMarcus Cousins had 25 for the Warriors. Each team played without a franchise star: 76ers center Joel Embiid missed his fifth straight game with a sore left knee. Embiid, averaging 27.3 points and 13.5 rebounds in 54 games for the Sixers, said he expected to return next week. Golden State's Klay Thompson sat out with a sore right knee suffered in Thursday's loss at Orlando. Without Embiid, Mike Scott scored 22 points and was a surprise star for the Sixers. Ben Simmons had his second straight triple-double and 22nd of his two-year career with 25 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists. Curry picked up his fourth foul with 8:15 left in the third and sat the rest of the quarter. The game got wild without him. Damion Lee, former star at nearby Drexel, hit a pair of 3s in Curry's absence that kept it a one-point game. Considered a throw-in as part of the Tobias Harris trade with the Clippers, Scott hit a pair of 3s that stretched Philly's lead to five. Golden State's stars put them ahead to close the quarter. Durant hit a step-back jumper and Andre Iguodala, the once-popular former Sixers, connected on a 3 for a 93-90 lead to close the third. Philly and Golden State combined for 11 3s in the third and Durant scored 12 points (4 of 9 shooting). TIP-INS Warriors: Big man Kevon Looney sat out because of right pelvic soreness. Alfonzo McKinnie left the game with left hip contusion. ... Kerr enjoyed Golden State's only visit of the season to Philly. ""This building's one of my favorites in the league,"" he said. ""Just the atmosphere, the fans, the engagement, now that they have it rolling."" 76ers: Played short-handed against the Warriors: big men Boban Marjanovic (right knee sprain) and Amir Johnson (upper-back tightness) also sat out with injuries. Jonah Bolden started for Embiid, and the backup was Justin Patton, who hasn't played this season. ... Franklin the mascot wore a Harper No. 3 Phillies jersey. COMEBACK KID Zhaire Smith, a 2018 first-round pick acquired from Phoenix on draft night, made his return to basketball this week in the G League. He suffered a broken left foot, and he had a severe reaction to food allergies that dropped his weight to 164 pounds. Smith is up 206 pounds and will finish the Blue Coats season before it's decided if he'll play this season for the Sixers. WILT'S 100 It was the 57th anniversary of Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game for the Philadelphia Warriors.

"DALLAS --  Jonas Valanciunas brought physical play to the new-look Memphis Grizzlies, and the Dallas Mavericks noticed. Valanciunas had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and backup center Joakim Noah scored 12 points to lead Grizzlies to a 111-91 victory over the Mavericks on Saturday night. Memphis had its largest margin of victory this season in winning for the second time in seven games. Dallas suffered its most lopsided loss of the season. The Mavericks have won one of their last seven games. ""We got our butts kicked, plain and simple,"" Tim Hardaway Jr. said. ""That's a physical basketball team, especially on the defensive end."" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle listed ways the Grizzlies excelled against his team. ""They were physical, they controlled the paint. They set a very physical tone. The NBA game isn't a game where you can come out and ease into it. You have to jump into it, and we just didn't do that."" Avery Bradley and rookie Jevon Carter each scored 15 points for the Grizzlies. Mike Conley and C.J. Miles each contributed 12 points. Valanciunas has had at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in three of his six games with Memphis, since being traded from Toronto. Valenciunas said he, Bradley, Miles and Tyler Dorsey, all acquired on Feb. 7, are becoming integrated into the team. ""Slowly we are. That's what we're working towards. We're trying to learn small things, little things like how to play with each other, how to know your teammates."" Conley, who has played his entire 12-year career with Memphis, noticed that progression. ""It feels good to just see guys really developing in front of your eyes. With so many new faces and young guys, having a game like this just shows you what we can do when everything's clicking."" Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 22 points. Dwight Powell had 13 and Hardaway scored 10. The Mavericks shot a season-low 31 percent (26 for 85) from the field. They made only 7 of 40 3-pointers (18 percent). ""We let our shot making, or lack thereof, kind of dictate the game,"" Mavericks guard Devin Harris said. ""They came out and played harder."" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said his defense was prepared. ""We knew they were going to shoot a bunch of 3s. What we wanted to do was limit the amount of open space that we gave up."" The Grizzlies used a 9-0 run to take a 33-21 lead after the first quarter. The Mavericks didn't shoot or rebound well in the first 12 minutes. They were 7 for 21 (33 percent) from the field, including 1 for 8 on 3-pointers. They were also outrebounded 14-8. Dallas pulled within six points at 41-35 midway through the second quarter, but the Grizzlies increased their lead to as many as 16 points and led 62-49 at halftime. Dallas scored the first six points of the second half on 3-pointers by Dirk Nowitzki and Doncic, but it was mostly downhill from there. TIP-INS Grizzlies: They led by as many as 36 points. The previous largest margin of victory was 21 points, 117-96, against Phoenix on Oct. 27. . F Justin Holiday slipped to the floor and injured his right knee in the first quarter. The Grizzlies said he could have returned to the game, but didn't. . Only Kobe Bryant has scored more career points against Memphis than Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki's 1,467. Bryant had 1,636. Mavericks: Dallas previous most lopsided loss this season was 26 points, at New Orleans on Dec. 5. . Doncic missed all five 3-point attempts in the first half. When he canned his first 3-pointer 54 seconds into the second half, he raised his arms triumphantly. His missed his final two attempts. .

"SAN ANTONIO --  A change of scenery has made all the difference for the Spurs. After a lackluster defensive performance during a recent road trip, San Antonio is suddenly back on its feet. LaMarcus Aldridge had 27 points and 10 rebounds and the Spurs led for all but 30 seconds in defeating Oklahoma City 116-102 on Saturday night, handing the Thunder their fourth straight loss. ""We've played more like we did during that stretch about mid-season,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I guess, for about 10 or 12 games, we did really well in all defensive categories. Then it kind of went away, it was kind of mercurial. Now, we're hoping that we're going to get consistent with it down the stretch here because when we do play defense we're a pretty good team."" Rudy Gay added 22 points and DeMar DeRozan had 18 points, seven assists and six rebounds for the Spurs. Oklahoma City, which has lost five of six, remains third in the Western Conference but has the same record as Portland at 38-24. San Antonio moved into seventh in the West past the Los Angeles Clippers, who have an identical 35-29 record. The Spurs have won six consecutive home games, including two since going 1-7 on their annual Rodeo Road Trip. San Antonio held Detroit to 93 points in their previous game. ""Just communicating, playing hard, getting to our spots and just trying to make things difficult on our opponents (defensively),"" DeRozan said of the turnaround. ""We're doing it each quarter and each quarter being more conscious of it."" The Thunder were without leading scorer Paul George, who missed his second straight game with a sore right shoulder. The team struggled to replace George's 28.6 points per game, which obviously impacted their offense. ""A lot, obviously,"" Russell Westbrook said, bristling at the question. ""When the MVP is not on the floor, he averages 30 points a game, it changes the offense a lot. You know the answer to that question."" Oklahoma City was held to 39 points and went 3 for 15 on 3-pointers in the second half while losing their eighth straight in San Antonio. The Thunder's only lead came at 7-6 when Dennis Schroder made one of two free throws with 9:05 remaining in the first quarter. Schroder finished with 18 points. Westbrook added 19, but Oklahoma City's fiery point guard was 7 for 17 from the field. San Antonio set a season high with 72 points in the first half, fueled by a strong start by Aldridge. Aldridge had 17 points in the first quarter, making his first five shots and combining with Derrick White to open the game 8 for 9. Among the baskets was White driving through the lane to deliver a no-look pass to Aldridge under the rim for a layup. White finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. The Spurs made 29 mid-range jumpers and shot 50 percent overall. ""They lead the league, that's what they do,"" Westbrook said of the mid-range jumpers. ""If that's what they do, you've got to be able to adjust to what they do and figure out how to best benefit our defense and how we play."" Gay had 14 points in the first half on 5-for-7 shooting. ""He's been able to be the focal in that group and score and kind of carry that group and keep it going,"" Aldridge said. ""It's been good lately and tonight it was really good. He got going and he carried that unit and gave myself and DeMar a longer break."" The scoring surge was capped in the third quarter when both teams combined to score 35 points. The Thunder were held to 15 points, one below their season-worst for the third quarter. TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City's last win in San Antonio came Dec. 25, 2014, when Westbrook had 34 points and 11 assists. ... The Thunder scored five points in the final minute of the first quarter to avoid equaling their previous low in the opening period of 20 points against the Clippers on Oct. 19. ... Oklahoma City's lowest production in the third quarter was 14 points at Dallas on Dec. 30. ... Adams picked up his third foul with 4:45 remaining in the first half, but remained in the game and picked up only one other foul while playing 23 total minutes. Spurs: Recently retired San Antonio guard Manu Ginobili was in attendance watching the game with his sons. Ginobili's jersey will be retired March 28 following the Spurs' game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. ... San Antonio's previous high for a half was 70 points, which they achieved three times. ... Aldridge has scored the most points against the Thunder since 2006. Aldridge surpassed Dirk Nowitzki's 876 points in the opening quarter. STILL SHOOTING White, who spent much of last season in the G League, only had two assists but helped settle the Spurs into their offense with his steady pace at point guard. White shot 6 for 10 from the field and had only two turnovers in 30 minutes. ""I'd say he has probably shown he belongs,"" Popovich said.","401071613"
"DENVER --  After falling into a big deficit in the first half, the New Orleans Pelicans had to play their way out of their early struggles. Jrue Holiday scored 29 points, Julius Randle had 28 and the Pelicans rallied from 19 points down to beat the Denver Nuggets 120-112 on Saturday night. Frank Jackson added 16 points for New Orleans, which was without Anthony Davis (rest) and E'Twaun Moore (thigh). ""We were just the hardest playing team, both offensively and defensively,"" Jackson said. ""We were able to get stops, we shared the ball well, we fed off our leaders' energy."" It also helped that they sent Denver's best player to bench with early foul trouble. Nikola Jokic finished with 20 points but was limited to 6:23 in the first half when he accumulated three fouls, including two in the opening minutes. ""We got him in foul trouble and if he's not on the floor he can't score,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Even in limited minutes, he gets 20 points. He's a great, great player, a terrific player. We did about as good a job as you're going to do on him from the standpoint of not allowing him to be a facilitator."" Jokic wound up playing for 21:34 in the game. ""Yeah, it's always nice if you can have your best player on the floor for more than 21 minutes,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""That's back to back games where he has been in foul trouble. We have to avoid that because Nikola on the bench does not help us in any way, shape or form."" Jamal Murray also had 20 points for Denver. It was the biggest blown lead of the season for the Nuggets, who have lost consecutive home games for the first time since early November. They lost 111-104 to Utah on Thursday night. ""We let other factors affect us,"" Jokic said. ""We let them take control of the game. We had the lead and were playing good defense. Then, we kind of relaxed and they used that against us."" New Orleans took a 111-102 lead with 7:12 remaining on a 3-pointer by Holiday. Denver fought back within five points with just under a minute remaining but a turnover by Gary Harris denied the Nuggets a chance to get closer. Holiday, who had stolen the ball from Harris, converted a three-point play on the other end with 20.6 seconds left to play to seal the win for the Pelicans. ""I thought he was going to shoot the 3. I felt like they needed a 3 and when he kept going I felt like he had me beat so I tried to let him slide by and once he exposed the ball, get a hand in there,"" Holiday said of his late-game steal. The Pelicans used a 13-2 run to take an 82-81 lead, their first since the game's opening moments, on Holiday's layup with 7:03 left in the third quarter. New Orleans led 96-93 going into the fourth on Cheick Diallo's dunk in the final moments of the third off Elfrid Payton's alley oop pass over a Denver defense that was slow to get back against a New Orleans fast-break. The Nuggets led by 19 points early in the second quarter but settled for a 71-67 lead at the half. After Isaiah Thomas hit a 10-foot floating jumper to put Denver up 49-30, New Orleans outscored the Nuggets 37-22 over a nearly 10-minute stretch during a 40-point second quarter to get back in the game. It was the eighth time this season the Pelicans have scored 40 or more points in a quarter. TIP-INS Pelicans: F/C Davis was given the night off. Gentry said before the game that Davis was dealing with a bit of the flu. ... G E'Twaun Moore was held out of the game with a thigh issue. ... G Dairis Bertans has been signed out of the EuroLeague.

"PHOENIX -- The Suns took a unique approach to guarding LeBron James, putting 7-foot-1 center Deandre Ayton on him. James got his numbers, but the Suns frustrated the Los Angeles Lakers star and were able to push back when he tried to lead a late charge. Ayton had 26 points, 10 rebounds and primary defensive duties against James, helping the Suns hold off the Lakers 118-109 on Saturday night. ""That was a fun game,"" Ayton said. ""I'm going to sleep well tonight."" Phoenix lost the first three games this season against Los Angeles by double digits, but the Suns had the Lakers a bit discombobulated through three quarters in the season series finale. The Suns' defense on James, led by Ayton, helped. The four-time league MVP was frustrated at times with Phoenix's defense and his team's inability to hang with the NBA's worst team. But as he has so many times, James tried to lead the Lakers back. With Los Angeles trailing by 14 with 6:06 left, James scored on a three-point play, hit a 3-pointer and kicked out to Brandon Ingram for a corner 3 on the break. He followed with a dunk off a baseline drive to get the Lakers within 112-109. Los Angeles got no closer, losing a game it couldn't afford to lose while fighting for a playoff spot. It dropped 4 games out of the eighth spot in the West with just 19 regular-season games left. ""We needed this game for obvious reasons,"" said James, who had 27 points, 16 assists and nine rebounds. ""It is just unfortunate with the opportunities we've had that we haven't been able to seize the opportunity."" Phoenix, which entered the game an NBA-worst 12-51, is the worst team James has lost to while playing in his NBA career (minimum 25 games into a season), according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. The Suns appeared as if they would wilt down the stretch, as they had done so many times. Instead, Phoenix shut down the Lakers and made six free throws in the final 52 seconds to win for the second time in three games following a 17-game losing streak. Devin Booker added 25 points for the Suns. ""We showed we can close games, execute in crunch time, having enough discipline,"" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. ""They were coming hard at us."" Both teams were in the second game of a back-to-back. The Lakers lost 131-120 to Milwaukee after the Bucks closed the game on a 15-2 run. The Suns followed their first win in six weeks with a 130-116 loss to New Orleans, allowing the Pelicans to hit 16 3-pointers and shoot 67 percent in the second half. The Lakers won the most recent meeting against Phoenix 116-102, despite playing without James, Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma. The Suns got off to a much better start Saturday, leading by 10 and making 13 of 19 shots in the first quarter. Phoenix stretched the lead to 14 early in the second quarter, but Los Angeles used a late run to pull within 66-59 by halftime. The Suns continued to frustrate James and the Lakers in the third quarter, stretching the lead to 95-78 behind Booker's 12 points. Midway through the fourth quarter, James led a push, but the Suns shoved back. ""We need to be better. We need to be a lot better,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""I am happy with the fight we showed in the fourth quarter, but where we are at in the season, that is the desperation that we need to start the game with."" McGEE'S LIFT Looking for a boost after Ayton dominated early, Walton turned to 7-footer JaVale McGee. He responded by hitting all 10 of his shots while scoring 21 points and grabbing seven rebounds. TIP-INS Lakers: Ball missed his 16th straight game with a bone bruise and sprained left ankle suffered in a collision with Houston's James Harden on Jan. 19. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell plays best when he feels free and just lets his instincts take over. Down 17 in the 4th quarter to the NBA's best team Saturday night, Mitchell turned to his Jazz teammates and said: ""We've got nothing to lose now. Let's go!"" Mitchell scored a career-high 46 points and led Utah back from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to a 115-111 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. ""You take certain risks that maybe you don't take when you are up 17. But we made the right plays and we got stops,"" said Mitchell, who said it was probably his best regular-season game of his NBA career. Mitchell scored 17 in the final 8:10, including a 28-foot jumper with 43.7 seconds left to put Utah up 111-105. Mitchell could have made the game a bit less suspenseful, but missed two free throws with a three-point lead with 12.7 seconds left. He came back and made two foul shots with 8.6 seconds remaining. ""My teammates were saying, `We need you for these two free throws. Forget about what happened,"" Mitchell said. ""When you have your teammates backing you like that, you feel confident."" But Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had been brilliant all night and had 43 points and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes, also missed three free throws in the final 10 seconds. ""Down the stretch they were making shots and we just couldn't get a stop,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""That was playoff basketball."" On a night during which Rudy Gobert was ineffective, Derrick Favors had 23 points and tied a career best with 18 rebounds. ""He was the real MVP of the game,"" Mitchell said. Joe Ingles had 14 points and eight assists for the Jazz, who won their fourth straight. Khris Middleton scored 29 points and Brook Lopez had 16 points, eight rebounds and seven blocks for the Bucks, whose seven-game winning streak was snapped on the second night of a back-to-back. In an incredible game of runs, the Jazz made the plays down the stretch to outlast the team with the best record in the league. Utah has won 17 consecutive games against the Bucks at home. While Antetokounmpo sat in the fourth quarter, the Jazz went on 17-2 run on the strength of Mitchell's drives to the basket. It was back and forth the rest of the way. Antetokounmpo relished going against Gobert, the reigning defensive player of the year, in space but also often initiated the offense and played the ballhandler role on the pick-and-roll. ""He kicked my (butt),"" Gobert said. Antetokounmpo scored or assisted on the first 15 points of a 17-2 spurt as the Bucks extended a 73-71 lead to a 90-73 advantage. Malcolm Brogdon was out with plantar fasciitis and Eric Bledsoe was a late scratch because of a bad back, so Antetokounmpo started at point guard even though he was originally being listed as questionable with right foot soreness. Antetokounmpo powered a 23-4 run bridging the second and third quarters to put the Bucks back in front, 64-57. Time after time, the Greek big man bullied Utah's vaunted front line as he drove the lane and finished at the rim. Facing one of the tallest lineups in NBA history with the five Bucks averaging more than 6-foot-10, the Jazz fell behind 11-0 and didn't score until Mitchell hit a pair of free throws with 8:41 left in the first quarter. Lopez had six blocked shots in the first six minutes of the contest as the Bucks led by as many as 14. ""They were attacking the rim really hard and we did a great job of protecting the paint,"" Lopez said. Utah led 53-46 lead at halftime. Antetokounmpo played without restriction at Los Angeles on Friday after sitting out with right knee soreness on Monday at Chicago and being limited to 24 minutes on Wednesday at Sacramento. PLAYING PRIME TIME Favors has been working back from a knee injury more than two years ago and finally feels like himself again. ""It's been a long road just getting my body back and making sure my knee's stronger so I can do that (big dunks in traffic) again,"" Favors said. ""It feels great to that again."" Favors starts but rarely finishes games. This time around, he was on the court at the end and tried to just stay focused as Mitchell was mesmerizing down the stretch. ""Once he starts making shots like that, all the attention goes to him so you get open. ... You've just got to be ready, keeps your hands open and be ready to take that shot,"" said Favors, who made all five attempts and had 13 points and seven rebounds in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Bucks: Tony Snell appeared to hurt his shoulder badly on a nasty fall in the first half. He punched a chair and kicked a sign in frustration on his way to the locker room, but then returned to the court before halftime. ... The Bucks shot just 38.5 percent on 3s and 2s. Jazz: Former Jazz greats Darrell Griffith, Mark Eaton and Mehmet Okur all attended the game ... Raul Neto missed the game with a tight hamstring. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nicolas Batum said the Hornets' game plan was to stop Portland's backcourt tandem of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. He didn't expect Rodney Hood to beat them. Hood broke out of a shooting slump with a season-high 27 points -- all in the second half -- and Jusuf Nurkic added 26 points and 15 rebounds to help the Trail Blazers beat Charlotte 118-108 on Sunday. ""I've been through worse slumps before. The biggest thing I did the second half was not think as much as I have,"" said Hood, who was acquired in a trade from Cleveland last month. ""You know, trying to learn the plays, try to figure everything out. When we just play ball I think I can affect the game in a positive way."" In the Blazers' last five games, Hood had made just 7 of 32 shots from the field, including 1 of 10 from 3-point range. And he didn't score Sunday until making a pull-up jumper with 2:26 left in the third quarter. But he carried that momentum over to the fourth quarter, when he made 7 of 10 shots -- including three 3s -- and all four free-throw attempts for 21 points. By the middle of the period, teammates could sense his confidence and were setting screens to free him up. ""I think C.J. was 2 for 12 and (Lillard) was 9 for 20-something,"" Batum said. ""We contained those guys pretty well and I think when you get like 21 points (from Hood) in the fourth, we didn't see that coming."" Lillard added 23 points for the Blazers, who have won six of their past seven. Portland entered the game tied with Oklahoma City for the third-best record in the Western Conference. The Thunder were hosting the Grizzlies later Sunday. ""Tonight it was Rodney Hood. CJ (McCollum) had a game against Toronto,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""It's just been different things on different nights, not one thing."" Jeremy Lamb had 23 points and Kemba Walker had 18 points and a season-high 12 assists for the Hornets, who entered the day tied with the Magic for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East. The Blazers limited Walker to 5-of-21 shooting. It was a back-and-forth game until the six-minute mark of the fourth quarter, when the Blazers went on a 12-2 run sparked by Hood to break it open. Portland scored from a variety of spots including a fast-break layup from a hustling Nurkic, an 18-foot jumper by Hood and a put-back from Al-Farouq Aminu that led to a three-point play. Hood ended Charlotte's chance of a comeback when he drilled a 27-footer from the top of the key to push the lead to 14 with 2 1/2 minutes left. The Blazers built a 56-50 halftime lead behind Nurkic, who dominated the paint in the first half with 14 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Lamb, who was benched earlier this month for rookie Miles Bridges, was the primary reason the Hornets stayed in the game, outscoring his team's entire starting five in the first half with 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Seth Curry, who is from Charlotte, played in his first NBA game at the Spectrum Center and finished with eight points. Hornets: Were outrebounded 48-35 by the Blazers. INSIDE PLAY Behind Norkic, the Blazers dominated the Hornets in the paint, outscoring them 58-38. ""He worked at getting position,"" Stotts said. ""When he had a matchup, he was able to finish around the basket. It's a tough matchup for (Cody) Zeller, so they tried to keep a bigger body on them."" KAMINSKY'S SPARK Frank Kaminsky has gone from afterthought to contributor in the last two games for the Hornets. Kaminsky had a second straight solid outing with 18 points and seven rebounds for Charlotte after playing in just three other games since the start of the New Year. ""He looks really aggressive right now, asserting himself,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said.

"James Harden is pleased with how the Rockets are playing and points to the fact that the team is getting healthy. (0:28) BOSTON --  James Harden and the Houston Rockets are at their best when they are knocking down 3-pointers, getting points in the paint and racking up points to the foul line. They did all three against the Boston Celtics and it added up to a mostly easy outing against a team that is continuing to struggle. Harden had 42 points before fouling out late in the fourth quarter and Houston held on to beat Boston 115-104 on Sunday for its fifth straight victory. Harden made six 3-pointers and scored 40 or more points for the 24th time this season. Houston entered the day in fifth place in the Western Conference standings, a game behind of fourth-place Oklahoma City. Eric Gordon added 32 points and had eight 3-pointers. ""We're finally healthy, so yeah. It feels good,"" Harden said. ""We winning, guys know their roles, we're executing defensively, we're helping each other out, we're talking. That's all it's about."" Boston has lost five of six since returning from the All-Star break. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics with 24 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Al Horford finished with 19 points. Boston did a decent job trying to contain Harden, limiting him to 14-of-31 shooting from the field and nine free throw attempts. But the Celtics were inefficient when they had the ball, shooting 48 percent (37 of 77) for the game and 29 percent (8 of 28) from beyond the arc. The Celtics started the fourth quarter with a 17-6 run to cut what had been a 28-point deficit to 106-96 with 6:08 to play. Terry Rozier got fouled on a 3-pointer at the five-minute mark, but missed all three free throws. It was 109-100 when Nene's rebound gave Houston a second opportunity after a Gordon miss. It wound up in Harden's hands and he stepped back and swished his final 3 of the game to push the lead back up to 12. But leading 112-104 Harden fouled out when he was called for an offensive foul with 1:44 left. The Celtics came up empty on their next trip down the floor and they were forced to foul after failing to corral Austin Rivers' miss from deep. Boston earned its first victory since the All-Star break on Friday night against Washington. But on Sunday the Celtics fell back into many of the same bad habits that had caused them to lose four straight prior to that win over the Wizards. Horford said he couldn't point to just one thing as the main culprit of their issues right now. ""We've had some good moments. But right now, unfortunately, we're going through a really bad stretch,"" Horford said. ""This is when our group needs to make sure that we stay together."" Things don't get any easier for Boston, which plays its next four on the road. Its trip out West begins with a matchup against Golden State and ends with games against the Lakers and Clippers. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden and Gordon combined to score 74 points on 51 percent shooting. ... Iman Shumpert missed his second straight game with a sore right calf Celtics: Shot 1 for 13 from 3-point line in the first half. FAST START Houston was the more aggressive team on both ends from the outset and led 65-43 at the half. Harden (23 points) and Gordon (20 points) matched the Celtics' output by themselves in the opening 24 minutes. The Celtics were often careless in the half court on offense. They turned it over five times in the five minutes of the game, leading to 10 Rockets' points. Boston's giveaways were exacerbated by its slowness getting back in transition. Other times the Celtics failed to help out teammates when they were beaten off the dribble, allowing the Rockets -- and particularly Harden -- to get uncontested layups. Houston scored 16 of its first 31 points in the paint. Boston hoped to get some defensive help with Aron Baynes returning to action after missing this last 11 games with a left foot contusion. But Harden repeatedly forced the Celtics to switch Baynes onto him on defense. Harden easily drove past the big man for layups on three occasions. When Boston did have the ball, they often settled for jumpers or tried to attack Houston one-on-one. With the Celtics trailing 53-36 late in the first half Marcus Morris airballed a desperation 3-pointer as the shot clock wound down, prompting a chorus of boos from the home crowd.","401071618"
"Trae Young reacts after he was ejected for hitting a 3-pointer and then staring down Kris Dunn. (0:45) CHICAGO --  Trae Young was on his way to another big outing before he got thrown out of the game. That left the Atlanta Hawks without one more important player. They still had enough to beat the Chicago Bulls and get some payback for a quadruple-overtime loss at home two nights earlier. Alex Len scored a season-high 28 points and Atlanta held on to beat Chicago 123-118 on Sunday. Len finished three points shy of his career high . He also made a personal-best five 3-pointers. Young scored 18 before getting ejected early in the third quarter for taunting Chicago's Kris Dunn. ""I'm proud of my teammates, the way they played with everybody being out,"" Young said. ""It's unbelievable. To get a win on the road is tough."" The Hawks had to get by again without leading scorer and rebounder John Collins. The 6-foot-10 forward missed his second consecutive game because of flu-like symptoms. But Atlanta pulled this one out after losing 168-161 to the Bulls at home on Friday. Lauri Markkanen led Chicago with 19 points, though he shot just 6 of 21. Antonio Blakeney scored 17, but the Bulls came up short after winning five of six. The teams went down to the wire again, coming off the third-highest scoring game in NBA history. The Hawks had to sweat out this one after leading most of the way. Markkanen hit two free throws to cut it to 118-117 with 1:14 left before Atlanta's Kevin Huerter answered with a floater. With fans ready to let out a deafening roar, Dunn missed a wide-open 3 from the wing with 21 seconds remaining. Huerter then missed two free throws with 15.7 seconds left. Chicago's Wayne Selden got the rebound. But after a timeout, Markkanen missed a 3 from the top of the key. The Hawks' Kent Bazemore got the rebound, then hit one of two free throws to make it a four-point game with 7.7 seconds remaining. ""It was fun,"" Markkanen said. ""They're a young team. We're a young team. We're going to be here for a while."" YOUNG TOSSED Young, who scored a career-high 49 in the previous game, got tossed after nailing a pull-up 3-pointer early in the third to make it 78-62. He stood with his hands on his hips as he stared at Dunn, leading to his second technical and an ejection. Both players seemed surprised, with Young saying, ""They made a call, I live with it. I looked at someone and that was about it."" But the way referee Mark Ayotte saw it, Young crossed a line. ""Taunting is directed at an opponent specifically,"" he told a pool reporter. ""Celebration is not directed at an opponent."" Hall of Famer Reggie Miller disagreed, tweeting : ""What's happened to my beloved NBA game? So damn SOFT and SENSITIVE now, nooooo way Trae Young should be given a technical for this.. I would have been broke and out of the league in 2 years. ... (hash)LetBallersBall."" Young and Dunn also had an exchange in the first quarter that resulted in both players getting technicals. There was some contact between the two after Young took a shot with play stopped following a timeout call. Dunn also appeared to shove Young in the back of the head or neck before Lopez got between them. ""I don't think I was too upset at all. It's basketball at the end of the day,"" Dunn said. TIP-INS Hawks: Collins did not travel with the team. ... F Omari Spellman could miss the remainder of the season because of a high left ankle sprain. Spellman was helped to the locker room late in the third quarter of Friday's game. He had an MRI on Saturday. The Hawks said he will be re-evaluated in a month, and coach Lloyd Pierce wasn't sure if Spellman will return this season. ""That one's tough,"" Pierce said. ""He sprained it very (badly). It's a legit ordeal."" The No. 30 overall pick in last year's draft, Spellman is averaging 5.9 points and 4.2 rebounds. ... F Taurean Prince, awaiting the birth of his second child, missed the game. Bulls: The Bulls held out F Otto Porter Jr. for precautionary reasons after he played 54 minutes on Friday. He recently missed a game because of a strained lower left leg.","401071619"
"LOS ANGELES --  Landry Shamet's mind was blank. His teammates were feeding him the ball and setting screens and the rookie took full advantage in his ninth game with the Clippers. He scored all of his 21 points on 3-pointers, Danilo Gallinari added 20 and Los Angeles routed the Knicks 128-107 on Sunday, sending New York to its 50th loss of the season. ""It was just free-flowing and the ball was going in,"" Shamet said. ""They were telling me constantly to keep shooting."" Shamet and Gallinari combined for 27 of the Clippers' 38 points in the first quarter when they raced to a 38-20 lead. ""It's tough to play defense against shooters and two or three at the same time is tough,"" Gallinari said. Shamet scored 18 of his 21 points in the opening 12 minutes. Shamet, acquired from Philadelphia last month in the Tobias Harris trade, tied the franchise record for threes in a quarter (six) and a half (seven). His seven 3-pointers set a franchise rookie record for 3s in a single game. ""We all know our roles since the trade,"" Shamet said. ""I feel like we all play very well together and take ownership."" Damyean Dotson scored 17 points, Noah Vonleh added 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Mitchell Robinson had 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, the worst team in the Eastern Conference at 13-50. Only Phoenix, the West's worst team, has lost more games (51) this season. ""We've got a lot of young guys who are still learning the game, who are still learning how to compete,"" injured center DeAndre Jordan said. ""We have a great coach in Fiz who's teaching them the right things and how to work in this league. It's a great culture."" The Clippers led 82-46 at halftime, the second-most points in the first half in franchise history and the most in any half since a club-record 87 on April 14, 1987, according to Elias Sports Bureau. ""It's nice to be able to take care of your business early and spread minutes around,"" Shamet said. ""That's valuable, especially in a back-to-back."" The Clippers tied a franchise record with 14 3-pointers in the half and their nine 3s in the first quarter set a franchise record for the most in any quarter. ""When he (Shamet) gets it going they see it and they made sure he got the ball,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. The Clippers' 38-point lead in the second quarter was their largest of the game. ""We were in mud,"" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. ""No matter who I put out there they were just heavy-legged and just really out of it mentally. It was a total lack of competitive preparation."" With most of the Clippers' starters resting in the fourth, Montrezl Harrell scored 10 of his 18 points. Lou Williams added 18 points. Ivica Zubac had 11 rebounds and Patrick Beverley added 10 rebounds. The Knicks outscored the Clippers 61-46 in the second half when they were in catch-up mode.

"CLEVELAND --  Kevin Love makes the Cleveland Cavaliers a different basketball team. The Orlando Magic learned that lesson Sunday night in what could be a costly loss for their playoff hopes. A night after being held out of a 36-point loss to Detroit, Love had 16 points and 14 rebounds and the Cavaliers pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 107-93 win. Orlando, which was coming off wins over Golden State and Indiana, rallied to tie the game at 81 with seven minutes to play before Cleveland took over. The Cavaliers hit seven 3-pointers in the period, including two each by Jordan Clarkson and Cedi Osman. Love is still progressing from foot surgery in November and has yet to play on back-to-back days. The five-time All-Star was ready after watching Saturday's 129-93 debacle. ""It was just sticking to the plan,"" Love said. ""I was very excited when I got asked the question (after the All-Star break) that I wanted to play in every game, that I wasn't going to miss any more games, but we're taking it day by day. It was a huge win for us against a team fighting for position."" Nikola Vucevic scored 28 points for Orlando. He was 13 of 16 from the field and had 13 rebounds. D.J. Augustin added 19 points for the Magic, who hold a very slim lead over Charlotte and Miami for first place in the Southeast Division and the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Orlando coach Steve Clifford held a long meeting with his players after the game. ""This is a bad loss, man,"" guard Evan Fournier said. ""We feel like we were too casual. We've got to grow. Cliff said a lot of stuff after the game. He said a lot of things."" ""Every game counts the same,"" Clifford said. ""To not look at it that way, that every game is important, it's a losing mentality and a total lack of understanding what the NBA is."" Playing his seventh game since returning, Love made two free throws and hit a 3 from the top of the arc during Cleveland's game-clinching run. Clarkson scored 19 points. Rookie guard Collin Sexton had 17 points and Osman scored 14 for the Cavaliers, who have won five of eight. Larry Nance Jr. and Matthew Dellavedova each added 11 points. Cleveland scored 17 straight points during a run that began late in the third quarter with Orlando leading 72-63. The Magic tied the game on Augustin's 3-pointer midway through the fourth. Vucevic scored 10 points in the third when the Magic pulled ahead after trailing by four points at halftime. Orlando, trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2012, has won eight of 11.

He played only 17 minutes against the Pacers, but told Clifford he was available after pregame warmups. ""You can't take any team lightly in this league,"" Augustin said. ""The Cavs deserved to win.

"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons may be peaking at the right time, winning nine of 11 games to surge in the standings, and would probably feel confident about their chances if they match up with Toronto in the playoffs. The Pistons, though, will likely have to get past the Raptors with their best player on the court when the games truly matter. Blake Griffin scored 14 of his 27 points in the first quarter and Detroit finished with plays at both ends of the court to beat Toronto 112-107 in overtime on Sunday, taking advantage of Kawhi Leonard having the night off. The Raptors rested Leonard less than 48 hours after he made the go-ahead shot in the closing seconds of their win over Portland. ""They're just doing the right precautions to make sure I'm healthy down the road,"" said Leonard, who has played in 46 of 64 games. ""I only played nine games last year so the boost is like 200 percent or something like that. It's all about the body. I know what the bigger picture is."" The highly charged, closely contested game might be a first-round matchup in the Eastern Conference playoffs. It looked and sounded like the postseason in Detroit, where a lot of Raptors fans could be seen and heard all night. ""It was definitely a playoff atmosphere out there,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""I'm not sure how many fans were cheering for us, but they were loud."" Both teams had chances to win in regulation, and in the extra period. Reggie Jackson put the Pistons up 96-91 with 1:56 left and turned the ball over on a no-look pass on their next possession. Kyle Lowry scored Toronto's next five points and OG Anunoby tipped in a shot with 25.6 seconds left to tie the score at 100. Lowry had the Raptors' first seven points in overtime, giving them a 107-102 lead with 2:22 remaining. The cushion wasn't big enough. The Pistons rallied and Andre Drummond made two free throws to put them ahead 109-107 with 46.1 seconds left. Lowry missed a contested layup with 7 seconds left and Detroit made free throws to seal the win. ""About the only thing he didn't do really good was make that layup to tie it late,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. ""He was amazing."" Lowry scored a season-high 35 points, grabbed seven rebounds and had five assists. ""He's the head of the snake,"" said Casey, who coached Lowry in Toronto. Toronto's Pascal Siakam had 21 points while Marc Gasol and Anunoby each scored 13 points. Jackson scored 19 points and Drummond added 15 points and 17 rebounds. ""We matched their effort and intensity the whole way,"" Drummond said. Detroit led by 13 points in the opening quarter and didn't trail until Gasol made a 3-pointer with 8-plus minutes left in the third. The go-ahead shot came shortly after Toronto got fired up because Siakam and Danny Green were called for technical fouls for arguing with officials. ""We started playing better after that, but it cost us some points,"" Green said. ""They're a tough team and they're playing well."" COSTLY BUMP Detroit's Zaza Pachulia was ejected after getting called for two technical fouls for screaming at officials and he will likely be disciplined by the NBA for bumping a referee. ""A veteran gets pushed in the back twice with no call and it is tough, but it is also tough to officiate in this league with all those bodies flying around and the emotion and passion,"" Casey said. TIP-INS Raptors: Jeremy Lin started in Leonard's place and was 0 for 8 and scored only one point. .... Leonard went through a workout on the court before the game and studied previous games on a laptop in a front-row seat. Pistons:  Luke Kennard became the 10th player in franchise history to make at least five 3-pointers in two straight games and finished with 19 points. ... Reggie Bullock, who now plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, made the winning shot as time expired on Nov. 14 when Detroit won at Toronto 106-104 as Casey made an emotional return to face his former team. ...

"WASHINGTON --  Bobby Portis' shooting touch returned Sunday and the Washington Wizards picked up a win. Portis had 26 points and 12 rebounds and the Wizards beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 135-121. ""Coming out after the All-Star break, really haven't had a good shooting night,"" said Portis, who had made 35.7 percent from the field over his last four games. ""Been rebounding the ball pretty well, but haven't had that good shooting night like I wanted. So, I was due for one and tonight it happened."" Portis was 10 for 18 from the field, including 3 of 6 from 3-point range. ""Bobby's a good spacer and a good filler behind the screen and he can roll, and he has a nice floater,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""I mean, his floater hasn't been falling for him, but that's his shot and it fell tonight."" Bradley Beal and reserve Jabari Parker each scored 22 points for Washington, which had lost five of six and trail eighth-place Orlando by three games. Beal added eight assists. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves with 28 points -- on 12-of-18 shooting -- 10 rebounds and seven assists. He had scored over 30 points in each of his last three games. Towns started slowly and went 1 for 4 with four points in the fourth quarter. Derrick Rose scored 18 points off the bench for the Timberwolves, who have lost three straight, all on the road. Taj Gibson had 14 points and 10 rebounds, and Andrew Wiggins had 14 points. ""We missed a lot of coverages, especially in the second half,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. ""It's harder to win on the road in the NBA when your defensive intensity is not there, and it hasn't been there for these three games here."" Minnesota, which scored 84 points in the paint, converted just 4 of 27 attempts from beyond the arc. The Wizards, meanwhile, had been averaging 18 turnovers per game since the All-Star break, but committed just nine. They made 11 of 33 from 3-point range while scoring 72 points inside. Parker scored on a dunk and followed with a 3-pointer to give the Wizards a 93-82 lead late in the third quarter. He finished with 11 points in the quarter and Washington led 97-87 at the start of the fourth. ""Just trying to get downhill,"" Parker said. ""My game is looking for others, but if I don't look out for myself, then I can't create for others, so I just try to keep that in mind and that kind of helped."" Minnesota got within 110-105 on a dunk by Towns before Sam Dekker (11 points, three assists) scored six straight points that started a 10-0 run, and the Wizards led by as many as 16 in the final minutes. ""(Portis and Parker) played with energy,"" Towns said. ""They hit some timely shots, tough shots. They're good players. The X-factor was Dekker coming in and playing the way he did.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook turned back the clock a bit on Sunday. Oklahoma City's All-Star point guard scored 12 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, and the Thunder rallied from a 13-point deficit in the final seven minutes to snap a four-game losing streak with a 99-95 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Westbrook shot 3 of 13 in the first three quarters, then went 4 for 7 in the fourth. It was similar to the late-game scoring binges he went on during his MVP season two years ago. The Thunder needed every bit of it -- forward Paul George, the NBA's No. 2 scorer and league leader in steals, missed his third straight game with a sore right shoulder. Oklahoma City supported Westbrook's late surge by holding the Grizzlies to 6-for-21 shooting in the fourth. ""One of the things we talked about that I said before the game tonight is that we've got to create a defensive identity regardless,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We have to defend at a higher level every single night. Offensively, we struggled to get any kind of flow or continuity there, but I give our guys credit -- they still tried to work as hard as they could to defend, even though offensively, we had our challenges."" It was the first time since Jan. 6 that the Thunder failed to score at least 100 points. ""With Paul out, certainly offensively, it's been a challenge the last several games,"" Donovan said. ""I've been trying to find a way to keep helping our guys offensively in order to create an identity with him being out."" Dennis Schroder added 17 points and a career-high 11 rebounds, and Steven Adams had 13 points and 22 boards for the Thunder. Avery Bradley scored 27 points, Delon Wright had 17 and Jonas Valanciunas added 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies. Mike Conley, the team's floor general and leading scorer, sat out with general soreness. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Conley's presence was missed in the fourth quarter. ""I think the guys put forth a hell of an effort to get themselves an opportunity to win the game, but it's a matter of learning who we are and who gets the touches where,"" Bickerstaff explained. ""You know in the fourth quarter we rely heavily on Mike, so it was somebody different we were having to find tonight, and that's just a matter of us getting comfortable and familiar with one another and growing and learning from it."" Memphis led 75-67 heading into the fourth, and the Grizzlies were up 89-76 before the Thunder found their footing. A 3-pointer by Westbrook cut the deficit to 91-86 and led to a Memphis timeout. Westbrook hit another 3 to tie the game at 93 with 1:04 to play, then a jumper from near the free throw line to put the Thunder ahead 95-93 with 31.9 seconds left. Wright missed a 3 and Schroder made two free throws at the other end with 14.9 seconds remaining. After Wright made a layup to trim the Thunder's lead to two, Oklahoma City's Terrance Ferguson hit two free throws with 6.5 seconds left to seal the win. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Wright had 15 points at halftime. ... Memphis held Oklahoma City to 31.9 percent shooting through three quarters, but allowed the Thunder to shoot 45.8 percent in the fourth.

"NEW YORK --  The Nets needed a win, and they got their easiest one ever in Brooklyn. DeMarre Carroll scored 22 points, Rodions Kurucs had 19 and the Nets easily snapped a three-game losing streak with a 127-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. Caris LeVert added 18 points and Spencer Dinwiddie finished with 16 on a night the Nets shook up their starting lineup but were fueled by their reserves. The 39-point margin was their most lopsided victory at home -- and matched their biggest victory overall -- since moving from New Jersey in 2012. ""This was definitely a game for us to build off of,"" guard D'Angelo Russell said. ""Coming into this one, we knew we had to get it. We know we've got a tough stretch coming up so we need all the confidence we can get."" The Nets were routed by teams below them in the standings in their last three games but led nearly the entire way, with the lead ballooning to 44 points. Brooklyn moved back into a tie for sixth place in the Eastern Conference. Dwight Powell scored 20 points and Luka Doncic had 16 for the Mavericks, who lost for the seventh time in eight games. Dallas did finally get Dirk Nowitzki a couple late baskets after he missed his first nine shots in what could have been his last game in Brooklyn. ""It was ugly from start to finish,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When you lose every quarter in an NBA game, you certainly haven't done what you needed to do, so very disappointing night."" With Treveon Graham out with back soreness, Kurucs started at power forward, and coach Kenny Atkinson also inserted Allen Crabbe for LeVert at shooting guard. LeVert had started the previous seven games after coming off the bench in his first two after a returning from a 42-game absence with a dislocated right foot. ""I think we wanted to change something up, do something different. Him coming off the bench or starting, he told me this morning, `I really don't care, Coach, as long as I get my minutes,"" Atkinson said of LeVert, who was the team's leading scorer when he got hurt. ""He got his minutes."" Atkinson said before the game that Brooklyn's problem in its recent losses to Washington, Charlotte and Miami was poor shooting affecting their effort on defense. Neither side of the floor was a problem in this one, as the Nets were shooting above 60 percent into the fourth quarter before finishing at 56.5 percent. They limited Dallas to 35.6 percent. The Nets led 31-21 after one and quickly pushed the lead to 18 led by Carroll and Dinwiddie. They maintained that 18-point cushion at halftime -- after Doncic threw in a halfcourt shot for the final basket -- for their biggest halftime advantage of the season. They extended it to 26 after three, also their biggest margin of the season, and all that was left from there was cheering for Nowitzki to get on the board. Fans screamed his name as soon as the Mavs started bringing the ball up the floor, and booed the Mavericks players who took shots rather than pass to Nowitzki, who still hasn't said if he will retire. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas opened a three-game road trip. It has won five straight and 16 of the last 17 matchups with Washington, its next opponent. ... Nowitzki finished 2 for 13. Nets: Kurucs and Carroll both made five 3-pointers. ... Russell had 13 points and 11 assists. SUPPORT FOR DIRK Nowitzki said the receptions he has received on the Mavericks' trips to the East have been phenomenal, but he wishes the Mavericks could play better. They lost by 30 at Memphis in their previous game. ""So I am really appreciative,"" he said. ""I enjoy it, but I enjoy winning a little better."" ON THE ROAD Kristaps Porzingis has been traveling with the Mavericks, even though he won't play this season while recovering from his torn left ACL. Carlisle said it's doubtful Porzingis takes part in full practices this season, but that he's been doing a lot of things behind the scenes and vocal in huddles during the games. The 7-foot-3 forward hadn't been traveling with the Knicks before they dealt him to the Mavs. ""The No. 1 thing right now is his health, getting him back 100 percent, which will happen,"" Carlisle said. ""But in the meantime he's picked up his workouts, he's doing more aggressive 1-on-1, controlled banging-type stuff with some of our assistants and making great progress.""","401071625"
"MIAMI --  Dwyane Wade got into the record book for defense. And he saved the Miami Heat with offense. Wade scored 14 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and the Heat won their season-high third straight home game by topping the Atlanta Hawks 114-113 on Monday night. It was the highest-scoring quarter of the season for Wade, and it helped Miami beat Atlanta for the first time in four tries. ""That's textbook, Hall of Fame poise,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He's playing his best basketball of the season right now."" Josh Richardson scored 19 points and Justise Winslow added 18 for the Heat, who pulled into a tie with Charlotte for ninth place in the Eastern Conference. Dion Waiters scored 14 and Kelly Olynyk added 12. Vince Carter scored 21 points, all on 3-pointers, for the Hawks -- in his final head-to-head duel with Wade, and tipped his cap afterward. ""He's been a very dominant player for a long time and on your way out it's easy to say, `I'm going to ride this out and enjoy it,"" Carter said. ""But he's doing it like most Hall of Famers would do it -- go at it and leave my greatness on the floor every night until you don't see it anymore."" Kent Bazemore had 18 points and Trae Young finished with 14 points and eight assists for the Hawks. Atlanta also got 14 points from Dewayne Dedmon and 13 from Kevin Huerter. Wade made three consecutive jumpers, including a 3, to spark a 12-2 run in the fourth that took the Heat from down one to up by nine with about five minutes left. ""Got a couple shots to fall, you get in a rhythm,"" Wade said. ""We needed it. Obviously, we've had a lot of trouble with this team."" The end was frantic, starting when Carter hit a pair of late 3-pointers to start the Atlanta rally. Winslow fouled Young with 2:04 left, then picked up a technical as well. Young missed the technical free throw, then made both for the personal to get the Hawks to 111-107. And down by three, after a Heat turnover, Young had a blow-by for a layup that cut Miami's lead to 112-111 with 1:02 left. Wade got free for a layup on the next possession to put Miami back up by three. Bazemore made a pair of foul shots with nine seconds left, but the Heat inbounded the ball and wound up running out the clock -- with the Hawks never catching anyone to foul. ""We just fell asleep at the end,"" coach Lloyd Pierce said. Wade's block of Atlanta's B.J. Johnson in the second quarter was a record-setter of sorts. It was the 1,052nd blocked shot of Wade's career, including playoffs -- the most ever by a guard, one more than Michael Jordan. The regular-season mark still belongs to Jordan, who has 893 to Wade's 877. ""Either way, it's pretty cool,"" Wade said. TIP-INS Hawks: Bazemore took six free throws in 23 seconds during the third quarter, after getting fouled on 3-point attempts on consecutive possessions. He went 4 for 6, missing the middle free throw each time. ... Young is the 32nd rookie (and first for the Hawks) to have 500 assists in a season. He entered Monday with 499. ... John Collins, a South Florida native, missed the game with flu-like symptoms. Heat: Richardson, the biggest soccer fan in the Heat locker room, did some futbol-style juggling of the basketball during a fourth-quarter stoppage. Then he hit a 3 for a 104-95 lead. ... Hassan Whiteside (hip strain) returned after missing three games. He played as a reserve for the first time since April 8, 2016, ending a streak of 202 consecutive games played as a starter (including postseason). ... James Johnson (shoulder) was again active, but missed his sixth straight game. .. Goran Dragic (left calf strain) missed his second consecutive game. MOVING UP Carter passed Reggie Miller on the career scoring list -- doing so, fittingly, on a 3-pointer. Carter's third 3 of the first half gave him 25,280 points, one more than Miller for 20th place. Carter and Miller are both among the top seven 3-point shooters in NBA history. WADE'S BLOCKS Johnson became the 449th player to have a shot blocked by Wade. Joe Johnson and Ben Gordon each got blocked 12 times by Wade, more than any other player. The tallest players who Wade got were both listed at 7-foot-3 -- former Heat center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and Dallas' Kristaps Porzingis. The shortest to have one swatted by Wade was Earl Boykins, listed at 5-foot-5.","401071626"
