"Jae'Sean Tate drives towards the basket, goes behind the back and slams home the impressive dunk. (0:21) James Harden was back in a Houston uniform. It’s still unclear how many more times that’ll happen. The three-time defending NBA scoring champion made his preseason debut with the Rockets on Tuesday night, after starting to practice with his team just one day earlier following a late arrival to training camp amid incessant trade speculation. Harden scored 12 points in 21 minutes and the Rockets beat the San Antonio Spurs 112-98. Harden also had four assists, three rebounds and two steals. He checked out for the final time with 5:02 left in the third quarter, having missed his final four shots. John Wall and Ben McLemore each had 15 points for the Rockets, who got 11 points apiece from Eric Gordon and Jae’Sean Tate and 11 rebounds from DeMarcus Cousins. As expected, Wall and Harden were the starters in the Houston backcourt. “It can be really good,"" first-year Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “To have two dynamic ballhandlers on the floor who can do a bunch of different things, play off each other, create for each other, it can be really, really good."" Harden was not planning to address reporters after the game. “Just happy to see him back out there on the floor,"" McLemore said. Lonnie Walker IV scored 17 for the Spurs, who got 13 points, seven assists and five rebounds from Dejounte Murray. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 12, while Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell each added 11 for San Antonio. Harden seemed anything but disinterested to start his first live game action of the season. He stood immediately to the right of Silas in the pregame huddle, his eyes staring intently at whatever the coach was sketching on a dry-erase clipboard before taking the floor. Harden's first shot was a made straightaway 3-pointer and his second attempt led to him getting fouled from beyond the arc and making three free throws. So, his shooting touch was there, at least at the outset — as was his touch on passes. He connected with Danuel House on a three-quarter-court chest pass to set up a dunk late in the opening quarter, timing clearly not much of an issue after a couple months off. Harden went 3 for 10 from the field, including 2 for 6 from 3-point range. He also went 4 for 5 at the free-throw line. “I thought our young guys played him pretty wisely,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “I think we fouled him one time on a 3-point shot, but that's going to happen with him. He's pretty clever. We were better on him than we were John Wall. I thought John Wall got by us much too often."" Wall said he isn't recruiting Harden to stay in Houston, focusing instead on how they can work best together as teammates now. “He's going to do what's best for him. ... I don't try to ask him about that because that's his personal business,"" Wall said. The Rockets lost guard Chris Clemons with 9:58 left, after he was taken off the court in a wheelchair. Clemons made a 3-pointer for an 87-74 Houston lead, and after retreating to the defensive end for the ensuing possession, appeared to take a bad step and immediately began reaching for his right Achilles area. There was no immediate diagnosis of Clemons’ injury, but given his reaction when it happened and as he was being wheeled off the floor it was reasonable to think that the Rockets were bracing for bad news. “Right when it happened, I knew exactly what it was,"" said Wall, who has dealt with Achilles surgery himself. There are four games Wednesday, followed by seven on Thursday, eight on Friday and then three in the preseason finales Saturday. The regular season begins on Dec. 22. Tuesday’s games: 76ERS 108, CELTICS 99 At Philadelphia, Shake Milton scored 19 points, Joel Embiid added 18 and Tobias Harris finished with 16 points and a game-high nine rebounds for the 76ers in the preseason opener for both clubs. Ben Simmons had 10 points and six assists for Philadelphia. Jeff Teague scored 18 for Boston. He shot 7 for 9 on a night where some Celtics struggled mightily from the field; Jaylen Brown made his first shot and went 0 for 10 the rest of the way, and Jayson Tatum finished just 4 for 13. Payton Pritchard had 12 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for Boston. Tatum finished with 10 points.","401265849"

"Duncan Robinson knocks down a Christmas Day record-tying seven 3-pointers to help the Heat beat the Pelicans. (1:10) MIAMI -- — Erik Spoelstra remained perfect on Christmas, and a record-tying show from Duncan Robinson helped him stay that way. Robinson made seven 3-pointers — tying the Christmas single-game mark — and scored 23 points, helping the Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-98 to start the NBA’s holiday quintupleheader Friday. “It's super special to play in Christmas,"" Robinson said. “I certainly don't take it for granted."" Goran Dragic scored 18 points, Bam Adebayo had 17 and Avery Bradley finished with 12 for Miami, and Spoelstra improved his Christmas record as Heat coach to 8-0. “I wasn't even aware of that,"" Spoelstra said. “Just shows you that we've had some really good teams here and teams that have had the opportunity to play on Christmas."" Precious Achiuwa and Tyler Herro each scored 11 for Miami, which lost Jimmy Butler at halftime with right ankle stiffness. Zion Williamson had 32 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes for New Orleans — the rebounds and minutes both being career highs. Brandon Ingram finished with 28 points. But the Pelicans shot 40% to Miami’s 51%. “We made some defensive mistakes that we shouldn't have,"" said Josh Hart, who scored 12 for New Orleans. “Lack of communication. We've got to communicate better on the defensive end."" Robinson’s seven 3s tied the Christmas mark Ingram set last year. “The guy is a great, great shooter. He's going to have nights like that,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “But at least three of them were ones where we could have done a better job."" JJ Redick’s 3-pointer with 7:43 left cut Miami’s lead to 91-85 and came during a stretch when the Heat went five minutes without a field goal. But the Pelicans got no closer. The Heat restored order by scoring 11 of the game’s next 13 points, and when Achiuwa — the rookie who had strong defensive minutes — forced Williamson into a turnover with 3:55 left, the entire Miami bench rose in celebration. “We knew they would make a run, but we stayed composed,"" Dragic said. New Orleans led 17-9 midway through the opening quarter — and got outscored 52-21 by Miami over the next 13½ minutes, with the Heat hitting nine of their 13 first-half 3s in that span on the way to a 23-point lead. The Pelicans chipped away, getting within 66-53 at the half and 88-79 after three. But New Orleans shot only 30% in the final quarter and Ingram went scoreless in those 12 minutes after playing the entire third period. Van Gundy lamented playing Ingram so much in the third. “Probably not optimal play-calling on my part, either,"" Van Gundy said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson's previous career high was 34 minutes. ... Redick fouled out for the second time in 898 career regular-season games, and missed six of his seven shots. ... The Pelicans are now 1/3 on Christmas. Heat: Andre Iguodala started the second half for Butler. ... Miami improved to 11-2 on Christmas. It hadn’t played on the holiday since beating New Orleans in 2015, and hasn’t lost on Dec. 25 since 2007. SEASON’S GREETINGS Heat forward Moe Harkless this week helped pay rent for about 50 New York families in dire economic circumstances this holiday season, plus covered lost wages and other essential expenses. “Means the world to me,” Harkless said. COMING HOME Veteran ref John Goble was crew chief and got to be home for Christmas; he’s a Miami native. Marc Davis (lives in Chicago, crew chief Friday in Milwaukee) and John Goble (lives in Connecticut, crew chief Friday in Boston) also got to work near home for Christmas.","401266794"
"Kawhi Leonard goes for 23 points and Paul George adds 21 in the Clippers' 121-108 win vs. the Nuggets. (2:21) DENVER -- — Kawhi Leonard was hurt and the Denver Nuggets were mounting a rally like they did three months ago. This time, the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t allow Denver to complete the comeback. Leonard had 21 points before taking an elbow to the face in the fourth quarter, Paul George scored 23 points and had nine assists, and Los Angeles beat the Nuggets 121-108 on Friday night. It was the second straight big win for LA, which beat the Lakers on Tuesday night. “We’re a different team than last year,” George said. The Clippers led by 11 with 6:11 left Friday night when Serge Ibaka went up for a rebound and caught the side of his teammate’s face with his right elbow. Leonard lay bleeding on the court before walking to the locker room. “He got up and walked off the floor, so he’s going to be good,” LA coach Tyronn Lue said. Leonard was ruled out shortly thereafter and was being evaluated postgame, but it did put a scare into George. “Really worried. I was thinking the worst,” George said. “I didn’t know if he was concussed or what actually happened, I just saw him laying on the ground. That was first and foremost, making sure he was OK.” The Clippers didn’t need Leonard to close out a Nuggets team that upset them in the second round of the Western Conference semifinals last season. Nikola Jokic finished with 24 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds for Denver, which has dropped its first two games of the season. Jamal Murray added 23 points, 13 coming in the fourth. The Nuggets rallied from double-digit second-half deficits in Games 5, 6 and 7 of the second-round series in September, winning all three and wiping out LA’s 3-1 lead to advance to the Western Conference finals. It was a surprising end for a team many thought could beat the Lakers and advance to the NBA Finals. George said he has put that disappointment in the past. “I buried last year, left last year in the bubble,” he said. “This is a new season, new team, new goals, new everything. I was ready and poised and confident coming into this year, and I was prepared coming into this season.” Denver wasn’t able to do it again but made a run after trailing by 24 late in the third quarter. The Nuggets used an 11-0 run into early in the fourth, and two 3-pointers by Murray sliced a 98-74 deficit to 106-95 with 7:35 left. “When you’re down 25, it’s about pride and about effort,” Murray said. “We wanted to play hard and let the lead take care of itself. We saw the lead chip away like we did in the playoffs, we just couldn’t get over the hump.” Leonard went out soon after but Denver never got the deficit under 10. “They made a run, we lost Kawhi so we could have lost our composure, lost our game, but we took a good timeout,” Nicolas Batum said. “We kept moving the ball and made big shots.” TIP-INS Clippers: F Marcus Morris (sore right knee) missed his second straight game, but coach Lue said he is day-to-day. “He’s been doing his own rehab with the sports science team and he’s progressing,” Lue said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green sat out with a left calf strain. Green, who played for the Clippers last season, has yet to play in the regular season after signing with Denver in the short offseason. SCROOGED AGAIN Denver was playing on Christmas night for the second straight season, with both ending in double-digit losses. Last year the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Nuggets 112-100 in Denver, stopping a seven-game winning streak. “Two years in a row we weren’t ready to play on Christmas night,” coach Michael Malone said. “Bah humbug.”","401266795"

"Steph Curry drains a 3-pointer in the second quarter to pass Rick Barry for second on Golden State's all-time scoring list. (0:23) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton scored 31 points and the Milwaukee Bucks routed the Golden State Warriors 138-99 on Friday to win their first Christmas Day home game in over half a century. Middleton went 10 of 15 overall and 6 for 8 from 3-point range, leading a strong performance from deep for his team. He totaled 58 points in his first two games of the season. “The weeks before the season, I just tried to put in good work, work on my game,” Middleton said. “So far, it's been working for me.” Milwaukee was 20 of 37 on 3-point attempts, while Golden State was 10 of 45. The Warriors were outscored by 65 points in their first two games, the second-highest total in NBA history through two games to 71 points for the 1987-88 Clippers. Golden State lost 125-99 at Brooklyn in its season opener. This was the second-most lopsided score of any Christmas Day game in NBA history. The Syracuse Nationals beat the New York Knicks 162-100 on Dec. 25, 1960. “The thing I was most disappointed in is we just had two good days of practice with our execution working on getting in our offense and making hard cuts and reads, and we did not execute much of anything,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “It was kind of scattered and disorganized. I'm disappointed in that. I've got to take the blame for that. I'm the head coach.” Milwaukee's only other Christmas home game came during the franchise’s inaugural season in 1968. The Bucks were on the road for Christmas the last two seasons, losing at Philadelphia in 2019 and winning at New York in 2018. Bucks players got a Christmas surprise before the game when they received videotaped messages from their families in a move orchestrated by team officials. “It was definitely the best gift that I got today,” Bucks guard Jrue Holiday said. Then they went out and delivered a dominant performance to bounce back from a season-opening  122-121 loss at Boston  in which Celtics star Jayson Tatum banked in a go-ahead 3-pointer and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw in the final second. Antetkounmpo had 15 points and 13 rebounds against Golden State, but the two-time reigning NBA MVP shot 4 of 15 from the floor and 7 of 15 from the foul line. Stephen Curry scored 19 points for Golden State, and rookie James Wiseman had 18. Andrew Wiggins had 12. Jordan Poole and Brad Wanamaker added 11 each. Donte DiVincenzo and D.J. Augustin each scored 13 for Milwaukee. Holiday had 12 and Bobby Portis added 10. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green sat out for the second straight game because of a sore right foot. … This marked the 12th time Kerr was part of a Christmas Day game. He has played in five and coached in seven. … The Warriors dropped to 13-17 in Christmas Day games. This was their eighth straight Christmas Day appearance. Bucks: Augustin made his Bucks debut after sitting out the Celtics game due to a strained left calf. The 33-year-old Augustin signed with the Bucks last month after spending the last four seasons with Orlando. CURRY MILESTONE WATCH Curry increased his career points total to 16,458, overtaking Rick Barry (16,447) to move into second place on the Warriors' list. Wilt Chamberlain holds the franchise record after scoring 17,783 points for the Warriors. Curry was 2 of 10 from 3-point range to give him 2,499 career 3-pointers. The two-time MVP is looking to join Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) as the only NBA players to make at least 2,500 3-pointers. Curry went 5 of 5 from the line to extend his streak of consecutive successful free-throw attempts to 55. He is chasing Barry's franchise record of 60 straight from 1976-77.","401266797"
"Kevin Durant throws the lob up to DeAndre Jordan for the slam, then on the next possession Kyrie Irving puts in the impressive transition layup. (0:30) BOSTON -- — Kyrie Irving scored 37 points with eight assists in his return to Boston and Kevin Durant added 29 for Brooklyn on Friday to lead the Nets to a 123-95 victory over the Celtics. Jarrett Allen added 11 rebounds for the Nets, who remained perfect so far this season and sent Boston to its first loss. Irving was 7 of 10 from 3-point range in his first regular-season game at TD Garden since he opted out of his Celtics contract in 2019. “We’re going to continue to see them. We’re in the same division,” Irving said, adding that there was “nothing added” to his motivation in playing his former team. Jaylen Brown scored 27 with eight rebounds for the Celtics and Jayson Tatum had 20 points and eight boards. The Celtics beat Milwaukee in their opener on Wednesday on Tatum's last-second shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo, but they couldn't do it again in their second straight matchup against a team expected to contend in the Eastern Conference this season. “The benefit of playing these two games against two other great teams is that it forces you to be better,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""It tests you to see where you’re at, it sets the bar, and now you know what you have to strive for.” The game began after a moment of silence for former Celtics player and coach K.C. Jones, who died earlier Friday. Durant scored 16 points in the third quarter, when the Nets outscored Boston 35-23 to turn a three-point deficit into an 86-77 lead. He scored nine straight Brooklyn points at the beginning of the third when the Nets took the lead for good. ""It’s still impressive to watch after all these years,"" Nets coach Steve Nash said. “For him to have little runs like that is nothing in his mind. For mere mortals in the NBA, it’s impossible to think of.” Boston led by three at the half before being outscored 35-23 in the third quarter, including a 9-0 run that turned a three-point edge into a 82-70 lead. It was 86-79 early in the fourth when the Nets, even with Irving and Durant on the bench, again scored nine in a row to open a 16-point lead.

"LeBron James jokes about how he has to drink wine to alter his free throw shooting, especially after an air ball at the line tonight. (0:44) LOS ANGELES -- — When LeBron James checked the stat sheet as he left the Staples Center court after his latest high-scoring Christmas victory, he realized the Lakers had scored 138 points with a mere 22 from him. The NBA champions already look like they could be even better this year. In their second game of the new season, even Luka Doncic didn't stand a chance of keeping up. Anthony Davis scored 28 points and James became the second-leading Christmas scorer in NBA history during the Los Angeles Lakers' 138-115 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. Montrezl Harrell scored 17 of his 22 points in the second half, and Dennis Schröder had 18 points and six assists in a second strong game for both new additions to the champs. Los Angeles outrebounded Dallas 53-27 and closed out its first win of the season with a dominant fourth quarter. “We have the ability to where we can have four, maybe even five guys that can score in the 20s any given night,” James said. “As long as we defend and we’re efficient, it’s a beautiful thing to see.” Doncic had 27 points and seven assists in his first starring role in the NBA’s showcase Christmas evening game for Dallas. Josh Richardson and Trey Burke had 17 points apiece as the Mavs started 0-2 with a late fade. Dallas' three offensive rebounds were fewer than Harrell, who had five. “You can’t win a game where the second-chance points are 35-0,” Doncic said. “It’s as simple as that. We box out, we win the game."" The Lakers were aggressive and accurate from the opening tip, taking a 69-57 halftime lead while hitting 61.4% of their shots. Doncic went 3 for 10 in the first half but combined with Burke for 22 points in the third quarter to keep it close. “The more we play with each other, the more we’re going to figure things out,” Davis said. “We prided ourselves on not losing two in a row last year, so we wanted to come out and make sure we do that.” HOLIDAY CHEERS James moved into second place behind Kobe Bryant for the most points scored on Christmas, passing Oscar Robertson in the third quarter. James has 383 points in 15 games on Christmas, while Bryant had 395 in 16 holiday appearances. TIP-INS Mavericks: Kristaps Porzingis is on the Mavericks’ trip while recovering from knee surgery in October. Coach Rick Carlisle said the Latvian big man is “making progress all the time.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo says he's upset he missed the tying free throw but hopes to learn from it moving forward. (1:29) BOSTON -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn't stop Jayson Tatum from knocking down a “tough, tough, tough” shot. Then the reigning MVP and defensive player of the year missed one of the easiest. Tatum banked in a fallaway, go-ahead 3-pointer in the final second, and Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw with 0.4 seconds left, allowing the Boston Celtics to escape with a 122-121 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night in the teams' season opener. “Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be in that position,” said Tatum, who scored 30 points. “If it goes down or not, that’s what I work so hard for. You just want to be in that moment.” Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for Boston, which entered the fourth quarter leading by 17 points. The Celtics trailed 120-119 when Tatum dribbled the clock down from 8.9 seconds before lofting a high-arcing 3 over Antetokounmpo  that kissed the glass on its way down. “I think aside from the ball going in the basket, I’m not sure we could have defended Tatum much better than we did,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I thought Giannis did a great job individually, great contest. Credit to Tatum, he banked in a 3 at the end of the clock.” Antetokounmpo called it a “tough, tough, tough 3.” Tatum said the glass wasn't really part of the plan. “Once I let it go I knew it was going to hit the backboard,” he said. “But I didn’t necessarily try.” The ensuing inbounds pass was thrown at the rim and Antetokounmpo tried to tip it in, but he was fouled. He made the first foul shot, but bounced the second off the front of the rim. “Obviously, there’s a bit of a weight on your shoulder because you know if you miss, that’s it for your team,"" said Antetokounmpo, who scored 18 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter. “I’m a winner. I want to do whatever it takes for my team to win. But you learn from every situation that basketball puts you in.” Khris Middleton had 27 points and 14 rebounds and big offseason acquisition Jrue Holiday scored 25 points for Milwaukee. The Bucks had the best record in the NBA in each of the past two seasons but didn’t make it out of the Eastern Conference finals. Milwaukee led by nine points, 48-39, midway through the second quarter before Boston rolled off 10 straight points and 19 of the next 23. Boston led 101-84 after three, but Antetokounmpo outscored the Celtics 10-2 over a two-minute span midway through the fourth to cut a 10-point Celtics lead to 109-107. “We took a good hit and kept ticking,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. TOMMY POINT The Celtics observed a moment of silence for Tommy Heinsohn before the game and played a tribute video at the first break for the player, coach and broadcaster who was with the team for more than 60 years and all 17 of its NBA titles. Heinsohn, who died last month at the age of 86, won eight championships in nine years as a Celtics player from 1956-65. He won three more titles as a coach and was the fourth person inducted in the basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. The Celtics lowered eight of their championship banners courtside, picking the ones they deemed to have special meaning to Heinsohn. TIP-INS Bucks: During the game, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on guard Donte DiVincenzo for the 2021-22 season. DiVincenzo had 15 points and five assists. Celtics: Newcomers Jeff Teague scored 19 points in 25 minutes, and Tristan Thompson had 12 points and eight rebounds.","401266804"
"Steph Curry goes for 20 points and 10 assists in his first regular-season game since March as Golden State falls to Brooklyn on opening night. (1:41) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant shook off 18 months of rust in a matter of minutes. Durant looked good as new against his old team, Kyrie Irving was even better and the Brooklyn Nets emphatically kicked off the Steve Nash era with a 125-99 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night in the NBA's season opener. Durant finished with 22 points in 25 minutes of his first official game since rupturing his Achilles tendon while playing for Golden State in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. It's a new start for Durant, but he did the same things he's been doing for years. “I tried not to make too big a deal out of this whole thing and realize I’ve been playing this game since I was 8 years old, so just got to revert back to what I know,” Durant said. Irving led Brooklyn with 26 points and Caris LeVert scored 20 as the Nets led by as many as 38, pouring on the points the way the Phoenix Suns did when Nash was their point guard, or more recently Golden State did when Durant was their All-Star forward. The Nets made the playoffs last season but now are expected to contend for the Eastern Conference title after finally getting Durant and Irving on the court together. They used the first game of the shortened, 72-game season to prove they might be worth the hype. “I think our goals are a lot higher this year and we just want to be able to come in and dominate and do that consistently,” Irving said. Stephen Curry had 20 points and 10 assists for the Warriors, a depleted team that looks nothing like the powerhouse that won two titles in Durant's three seasons there. Durant left shortly after having surgery following his injury and was expected to sit out the entire 2019-20 season even before it was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Teammates who have worked out with him said the four-time scoring champion was back in top form and Durant quickly backed up their boasts in a mostly empty Barclays Center. He made his first three shots, one a 3-pointer and another while being fouled, and was in double figures in fewer than five minutes. He did everything but keep up with Irving, who made three 3-pointers and had 17 points in 9 1/2 minutes of the opening quarter, when the Nets led by as many as 21. Irving, himself coming back from injury after playing just 20 games last season because of shoulder problems, had Brooklyn’s last two baskets of the first half, including a deep 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds left that made it 63-45. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he was happy for Durant but upset with what he saw from his team, trying to bounce back after winning a league-low 15 games last season. “Both Kevin and Kyrie just kind of had their way in the first half,"" he said. ""So the lack of physicality and competition were the most disappointing things.” Durant then scored 10 more in Brooklyn's 36-point third quarter, ending his night for good late in the period. No. 2 pick James Wiseman started at center despite his limited preparation and had 19 points and six rebounds. But the Warriors, playing without Draymond Green because of a sore right foot, need to find more shooting around Curry with Klay Thompson set to miss a second straight season. Andrew Wiggins was 4 for 16 for his 13 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. was 3 for 14. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said Green planned an individual workout Tuesday and would hopefully do some group work Wednesday when they remained in New York to practice. ... Wiseman, at 19 years, 266 days, became the third-youngest Golden State player to start a game behind Andris Biedrins (18, 352) and Anthony Randolph (19, 179). ...

"The Clippers are fueled by Paul George scoring 33 points on 13-of-18 shooting from the field as they go on to defeat the Lakers on opening night 116-109. (2:15) LOS ANGELES -- - After the Los Angeles Lakers got their championship rings, the Los Angeles Clippers gave a performance that showed this retooled team is determined to contend for its own jewelry several months from now. Paul George scored 26 of his 33 points in the second half, Kawhi Leonard added 26 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied past the Los Angeles Lakers on the NBA champions' ring ceremony night for a 116-109 victory Tuesday. George went 13 of 18 with five 3-pointers in an outstanding first game since agreeing to add four years and $190 million to his contract with the Clippers, who never trailed in the latest meeting of Southern California's two NBA powerhouses. The Clippers beat the Lakers in the season opener for the second straight year while winning coach Tyronn Lue's debut. The Clippers stayed in their locker room while the Lakers received their rings, but they emerged with purpose and determined play - from their two superstars in particular. ""Our focus was on us,"" Lue said. ""The Lakers, they deserved that ring. They had a great year, and you can't take nothing away from them. Our focus wasn't really on the Lakers. They were the best team last year, so congratulations to them again, but now we're moving on."" LeBron James scored 22 points and Anthony Davis had 18 for the Lakers just 72 days after they finished off the Miami Heat in the NBA bubble.

The Lakers returned from the shortest offseason in league history and celebrated  the franchise's 17th title, but they couldn't keep up with George and Leonard down the stretch. Lakers coach Frank Vogel also limited James' playing time and kept Davis to 31 minutes, anticipating the long grind ahead on his veterans after a 10-week offseason. ""It's not ideal, but I do feel it's necessary to manage those guys' minutes the right way,"" Vogel said. ""Getting through this stretch healthy is a priority, and evaluating how our new guys fit is a priority when we haven't had a normal amount of time to do that. The five guys on the floor have got to be better than they were tonight."" Serge Ibaka scored 15 points in his debut for the Clippers, who hadn't played since blowing a 3-1 playoff series lead to Denver and ruining a much-anticipated conference final showdown with the waiting Lakers in the bubble. The collapse led to coach Doc Rivers' departure, and Lue moved down the bench to take over a star-studded team with several new additions. The Lakers fell behind by 22 points under the ring hangover in the first quarter, but they erased all but two points of the deficit in the second. The Clippers pulled away late in the third with George scorching a series of one-on-one defenders. He scored 11 more points in the fourth to seal it. ""We're not thinking about last year,"" Leonard said. ""It's a different team. I'm just happy that we kept playing basketball the right way. Even if we lost the lead, we turned around and kept playing our basketball. We ran our offense, and that's what we take pride in tonight. Everybody had each other's back and was staying positive.""

"Damantas Sabonis goes for 32 points as the Pacers win their season opener vs. the Knicks 121-107. (2:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Victor Oladipo took matters into his own hands after a sluggish first half Wednesday night. He drove to the basket, made shots and wound up scoring 16 of his 22 points in the final 24 minutes to lead the Indiana Pacers past the New York Knicks 121-107 on opening night. “He wanted to be assertive in that second half,"" new coach Nate Bjorkgren said after collecting his first career win. “I thought he was very aggressive, attacking the basket more, looking to shoot it more. I liked his aggressive mentality on both ends of the floor."" Domantas Sabonis finished with a career-high 32 points, along with 13 rebounds and five assists to help Indiana win its fourth opener in five years. RJ Barrett finished with 26 points and Alec Burks had 22 for New York, which lost on opening night for the fourth time in five years and the first time in coach Tom Thibodeau's tenure. And after a strong start, Thibodeau certainly expected a stronger finishing punch from his team. “The way we played in the first half is the way we need to continue to play,"" he said. “We probably played 24 minutes of good basketball and to win on the road, you have to do more than that."" It wasn't pretty and with only a few dozen people in the Bankers Life Fieldhouse stands, the energy was lacking, too. But Oladipo's opening outburst in the second half changed everything.

Indiana never trailed again. The Pacers extended the margin to 83-77 after three, made it a double-digit game early in the fourth and pulled away midway through the fourth. “I’m just going to go out there and be assertive, be aggressive,"" Oladipo said. “Everything else will take care of itself.""

"Nikola Vucevic sends a beautiful assist to Evan Fournier who cuts backdoor to the hoop for an and-1 in the final minute of action. (0:20) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — For a third time in the past four years, the Orlando Magic opened their season on their home court with a stirring victory beat the rival Miami Heat. Clearly, though, it will take more than just a victory over the defending Eastern Conference champion Heat for the Magic to back up forward Aaron Gordon’s bold talk of the team being ""overlooked.’’ Evan Fournier hit a go-ahead 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter, converted a three-point play off another driving layup in the final minute and scored 25 points in the Magic’s 113-107 victory over Miami on Wednesday. ""It was a good win and you always want to win the first game, especially when it’s at home,’’ said Fournier, who scored nine points in the final period for Orlando. ""It’s definitely rewarding to win against a team like Miami because it’s always tough to play against them.’’ The Sunshine State rivals opened the regular season against one another for the sixth time. Oddly, the two rivals have started their seasons in Orlando four times in the past five years. The Magic are 5-1 in their six openers against their rivals from South Florida. Bam Adebayo led Miami with 25 points and 11 rebounds, Goran Dragic added 20 points, and Jimmy Butler had 19 points and seven assists. The Heat turned the ball over 22 times, leading to 24 Magic points. ""One, empty possessions. Two, we didn’t get the necessary ball movement … and thirdly, (the Magic) are a good defensive team,’’ said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra’s, whose team was playing for the first time since losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals in October. Miami led 83-79 after three periods and it was up 93-91 with 4:29 to play following Adebayo's dunk. However, Fournier soon after swung the momentum to the Magic’s side with his strong finish. Fournier, who is looking to bounce back this season after struggling in last season’s playoffs, made all three of his shots in the fourth quarter. Gordon had 20 points and seven rebounds, Terrence Ross chipped in 19 and Nikola Vucevic added 15 points and 11 rebounds. Point guard Markelle Fultz added 15 points and made two clutch free throws with 1:11 to play. Gordon is confident that the Magic can open some eyes with their play this season. ""I don’t think, outside of Orlando, people have a lot of belief in us,’’ said the forward, who made 8 of 11 shots. ""I don’t think they think that we’re going to become potential contenders or even have a playoff slot and I don’t think that’s true. I feel like we’re really ready to make that next leap.’’ TIP-INS Heat: Dragic, who played well despite struggling with a foot injury much of training camp, was upset with his team’s hustle. ""We talked and thought we did not play hard enough,’’ Dragic said. ""This is what we need to correct.’’ Magic: The Magic held a moment of silence prior to tipoff to honor franchise co-founder Jimmy Hewitt. He died last month at the age of 79.

"Russell Westbrook scores 21 points, while dishing 15 assists and bringing in 11 rebounds vs. the 76ers. (1:29) PHILADELPHIA -- — The 76ers have gone more than a year without losing in Philadelphia, a stretch that included a coaching change, a roster revamp, and a pandemic hiatus. The constant? Joel Embiid simply dominant down the stretch. Embiid scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 113-107 win over Washington on Wednesday night and spoil Russell Westbrook’s triple-double Wizards’ debut. The Sixers haven’t lost at home since Dec. 20, 2019. Westbrook and Bradley Beal were fantastic in spurts in the opening-night backcourt pairing that nearly handed 76ers coach Doc Rivers a loss in his Philadelphia debut. Westbrook had 21 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds to wow the Wizards after being acquired in the big deal that sent former cornerstone John Wall to the Houston Rockets. Beal, a two-time All-Star who was second in the league in scoring last season, had 31 points. “Not good enough. I’m kind of disappointed in myself,” Westbrook said. “There were plays where I could have had a better game.” Embiid, sensational in the fourth, and Shake Milton, who scored 19 points off the bench, were the go-to scorers late, and Ben Simmons sealed the win with a monster dunk in the waning moments. Simmons had 16 points — one less than Embiid scored in the fourth. “He’s the focal point. The ball is going to Embiid on every single play,” Beal said. “He’s a hassle down there.” Embiid was nearly unstoppable in the post in the fourth, getting the ball on five straight possessions at one point and turning them into buckets that wiped out a 10-point deficit. His driving layup with 1:09 left put the Sixers up 105-103, and he finished 10 of 17 from the floor. “I don’t think anybody can stop me, especially with the mentality I have this year,” Embiid said. The Sixers made their major change on the bench, hiring Rivers to replace Brett Brown and wake up a team that was swept out of the first round of the playoffs last year. Rivers has to find a way to make the Embiid-Simmons pairing work — two All-Stars who have yet to get the most of their prodigious talents and have frustrated fans with their flaws. Simmons showed an early willingness to try and fix his — making shots from beyond 15 feet. Simmons was encouraged by new teammate Dwight Howard, who won a ring last season with the Lakers, to stick around postgame and work on his shooting. Both players stayed on the court and Howard waved toward the stands — mostly security guards and team employees — to get louder during a shooting drill. Simmons was the subject of trade rumors, though new head decision maker Daryl Morey said the guard was not on the trading block. “Dwight’s been pushing me to get better. He wants me to be great,” Simmons said. “I really appreciate that. It makes you want to work.” TIP-INS Wizards: Israeli teen Deni Avdija scored seven points in his NBA debut for the Wizards. The 19-year-old was the ninth overall pick in the draft and had played for the Tel Aviv Maccabi club in Israel’s Premier League. “I know he’s only 19 years old but he plays with a passion, plays with a determination that I like,” coach Scott Brooks said. ... Beal and Westbrook each had six turnovers and Washington had 20 overall. 76ers: The 76ers bench largely outplayed the starters. Howard had 10 rebounds, Furkan Korkmaz scored 11 points and first-round pick Tyrese Maxey was a burst of energy early and had six points. SIR CHARLES PREDICTS TNT analyst Charles Barkley played with Brooks and roomed with him, too, when they played for the 76ers. Barkley put some pressure on his old teammate when he predicted the Wizards would make the playoffs. “I’ll tell you what, he’s guaranteed a lot and very rarely it comes through,” Brooks said. “My job is to take care of my former roommate and pay him back. ... Hopefully, we can have a good year and make the playoffs. I like our chances.” Brooks is entering the final season of his five-year, $35 million contract. THAT’S ENTERTAINMENT The 76ers had drummers, the cheer team held signs that read “Make Some Noise,” a DJ blasted music and the mascot Franklin roasted the Wizards with humorous signs to liven up an empty Wells Fargo Center.","401267173"
"Zion Williamson climbs the ladder and gets a big block on OG Anunoby. (0:23) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Toronto Raptors had their home floor shipped 1,300 miles when they relocated to Tampa for at least the start of the NBA season. Yet it was the New Orleans Pelicans who looked at home at Amalie Arena in the season opener for both teams. JJ Redick converted a four-point play with just over a minute remaining and finished with 23 points, and Brandon Ingram led all scorers with 24 points as the Pelicans rallied from an 11-point deficit and beat the Raptors 113-99 on Wednesday night. Zion Williamson had a big second half for the Pelicans and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams scored 18 and 16 points, respectively, in their first games with the Pelicans, who delivered new coach Stan Van Gundy a victory in his New Orleans debut. “I’d say that we fought very hard in a game that was very, very frustrating,” Van Gundy said. “We were turning the ball over, we were in foul trouble, not a lot was going right for us. We hung in there and kept fighting and then made enough plays and enough shots to pull away.” Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 20 points. Kyle Lowry finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Because of the current Canadian restrictions on cross-border travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Raptors are scheduled to play their first 17 “home” games at Tampa’s Amalie Arena. The second half of the NBA’s schedule will be released later. Lowry hit four 3-pointers in the second quarter, and when Siakam made consecutive 3-pointers, the Raptors opened their largest lead of the game at 11 points. Redick hit a couple 3s late in the second period, but the Pelicans went into the break trailing 57-50. Ingram spoke on the importance of Redick to the Pelicans. “He’s good to have around from a professionalism standpoint, so we like to have him around,” Ingram said. “We love that he can shoot the basketball and when he’s open he needs the basketball.” Early in the second half, Lonzo Ball and Bledsoe hit 3-pointers in a 9-0 run. Then, Ball and Ingram did all the scoring for the Pelicans on a 10-2 run that finished the third quarter and gave the Pelicans an 88-79 lead. They scored 38 points in the period. <U+2033>(The third quarter) ... zapped our energy pretty big time,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “We did seem to lose a little energy and maybe ran out of a little gas, too.” About 3,800 people attended the game, and Siakam said fans in the stands makes a difference. “I don’t know if it’s all Raptors fans or what the case might be, but I thought it was cool, just having people around it,” Siakam said. “Obviously we’re blessed that we have some people, some type of energy in the crowd to make the atmosphere a little better.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson, who averaged only 27.8 minutes over 24 games in an injury-filled rookie season, went to the bench with three fouls with 8:10 left in the first half. He did play 30 minutes. ... New Orleans shot 52.5% in the game and hada 45-35 rebound advantage. Raptors: The loss ended Toronto’s seven-game win streak in season openers. ... It was Lowry’s ninth straight opening-day start for the Raptors. ... The Raptors have seven undrafted players on their season-opening roster.","401267174"
"Trae Young throws an alley-oop from half court to John Collins who goes up to throw down a one-handed dunk to cap the fast break for the Hawks. (0:19) CHICAGO -- — Trae Young was tough to stop in his first two NBA seasons. Surrounded by more talent than ever before, he could become a nightmare for the league in his third year. Young scored 37 points and the revamped Atlanta Hawks pounded Chicago 124-104 on Wednesday night, spoiling Billy Donovan's debut as Bulls coach. “Just being able to go out there and put on a show in the first game was really good,” Young said. “Not every night obviously is going to be like this, but it's really good to have an opening game like this.” Atlanta shot 54% (43 for 80) from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Cam Reddish had 15 points and John Collins finished with 14. “All of our guys played well. All of our guys played together,” coach Lloyd Pierce said. Looking for their first playoff berth since 2017, the Hawks signed Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn during free agency. Rondo and Dunn were held out on opening night, but Bogdanovic had 15 points and seven rebounds, and Gallinari scored 13. While the newcomers could give Atlanta a big lift, the dynamic Young remains the engine that drives the Hawks. He seemingly scored at will against the Bulls, going 10 for 12 from the field, 5 for 6 from 3-point range and 12 for 14 at the line. He also had seven assists and six rebounds in just 26 minutes. “The way we spaced, it opened up a lot of driving lanes and gaps to the rim for either shots at the rim or if they helped, we had shooters open,” Young said. Chicago cleaned out its front office and fired coach Jim Boylen after it went 22-43 last year during its third consecutive losing season. Donovan was hired in September, and it looks as if he has quite the job ahead of him. Zach LaVine scored 22 points and Lauri Markkanen had 21 points and seven rebounds in a solid start to an important season for the 23-year-old forward. But the Bulls struggled defensively and were careless with the ball at times, finishing with 17 turnovers. “We did not help each other well enough defensively,” Donovan said. Patrick Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in this year's draft, had 16 points for Chicago in his NBA debut. The 19-year-old Williams became the youngest player in Bulls history to start their first game of the season. Young led the way as Atlanta grabbed control in the first half. He found Collins for an alley-oop jam that made it 66-46 with 4:49 left. He had 27 points on 7-for-9 shooting at the break, helping the Hawks to an 83-59 halftime lead. “We just didn't come to play as a team,” Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr. said. TIP-INS Hawks: Dunn (right knee) missed the game against his former team. Dunn played for the Bulls for the past three seasons before signing a $10 million, two-year contract with the Hawks in free agency. “He's just at a point where he's trying to get right,” Pierce said. “He's been doing some non-contact activity.” ... C Clint Capela (left Achilles soreness) and Rondo (health and safety protocols) also were held out. Asked if it could be a lingering issue with Capela, Pierce said: “No, I just thought he was sore.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young missed the opener because of an infection in his lower left leg. ... Donovan didn't reveal his starters until right before his first game. He went with Williams, Markkanen, LaVine, Carter, and Coby White, but he said staying flexible is important this year because of COVID-19 protocols. “I think we've got to do a good job, players and coaches, of making sure we're all staying ready,"" he said. ROOKIES While Williams started in his NBA debut, Atlanta rookie Onyeka Okongwu was sidelined by a foot injury. Okongwu, a 6-foot-9 center from Southern California who was selected by the Hawks with the No. 6 pick in the draft, will be re-evaluated on Monday, the day of Atlanta’s home opener against Detroit.","401267175"
"Ja Morant stuns the Spurs with an impressive dunk after throwing the ball off the glass to himself for a two-handed slam. (0:29) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and nine assists, Dejounte Murray added 21 points as the San Antonio Spurs used a balanced attack to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 131-119 on Wednesday night, overcoming a huge game by Ja Morant. Morant -- the reigning rookie of the year -- had 34 of his career-high 44 points in the second half. While that helped carry the Grizzlies offensively, it wasn’t enough to put a deep dent in San Antonio’s double-digit lead through much of the second half. “I’m not happy at all,” Morant said when asked about the career-high, adding: “We came up short. So, learning from this game and prepare for the next.” While the game tipped off the Grizzlies 20th season in Memphis, things were toned down from the normal baptism of a new campaign. FedExForum was void of any fans, leaving any crowd noise to recorded reactions. “I thought our guys, our young guys competed hard, really showed themselves well for the first game we played together,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. He later added that Murray’s defense “did a good job making Morant work.” “At the end, I think we were probably a little bit tired. But Morant just took it in his own hands and decided to attack the rim. I don’t think we got back really well the last six, seven minutes of the game. But, fortunately, we were able to continue scoring.” LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for San Antonio, while Lonnie Walker IV and Keldon Johnson had 16 each, part of seven Spurs finishing in double figures. “I think we got a little sloppy toward the end,” Murray said. “But like I said, we fought, we played together, and we made it happen and we came out with a win.” Dillon Brooks scored 16 for the Grizzlies, while Jonas Valanciunas added 15 points and 13 rebounds. The Spurs, who fell behind early as Memphis was connecting on 3-pointers, clamped down on defense in the second quarter. The stingy defense and much better shooting by the Spurs helped San Antonio to a 66-53 lead at the break. “They really picked up their pressure in the second quarter, which I think really think impacted both sides of the ball,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. TIP-INS Spurs: Fourth-year G Derrick White was out recovering from left toe surgery. …Wore their City Edition jerseys with the fiesta colors – teal, pink and orange – across the chest and down the side of the shorts. … G Patty Mills connected on a 3-pointer in the second quarter, moving him ahead of Allen Iverson for 99th on the all-time made 3-pointer list with 1,060. Grizzlies: Are 9-17 in home openers, and had won six of their last eight entering the game. …Memphis remained without F Jaren Jackson Jr. (left knee meniscus surgery) and swingman Justise Winslow (left hip displacement). … Valanciunas reached 1,000 career rebounds in the third quarter. DANCIN’ POP: Spurs swingman Lonnie Walker IV apparently is trying to help coach Gregg Popovich into music, teaching the San Antonio coach about some of the better rap artist. “The only ones that I listen to are the ones you can dance to,” Popovich said. “If you can’t dance to it, then it’s not good.”","401267177"
"Karl-Anthony Towns describes the struggle he has been going through as he recovers emotionally from the death of his mother. (1:32) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Minnesota's season-opening victory over Detroit was winding down, and Karl-Anthony Towns was urged by teammate D'Angelo Russell to grab the game ball as a keepsake. For mom, in memory. Towns had 22 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, leading the Timberwolves past the Pistons 111-101 on Wednesday night after a pregame moment of silence and moving tribute video for the All-Star center's mother. Jacqueline Cruz-Towns died of complications from COVID-19 in April. “When you go through what I’ve been through, you just find a different source of strength. I don’t know how to explain it. I made a promise to these guys to be here for them,” Towns said. Malik Beasley scored 23 points, Russell pitched in 18 points, and Anthony Edwards — the first overall draft pick last month — added 15 points in his debut as the Timberwolves overcame a deficit that often reached double digits and was still 12 points midway through the third quarter. In a promising sign for this long-languishing franchise, they leaned on their defense to come back. “We grew up, man,” Towns said. Towns had to do a lot of that off the court this spring and summer, while the NBA paused for the pandemic. “You may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13th,"" Towns said. ""He’s never coming back. I don’t remember that man. I don’t know that man. You’re talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago,” Towns said. Towns, who made Minnesota’s first basket after an 0-for-7 start by the team, gave the Timberwolves their first lead of the game at 98-97 on a 3-pointer with 3:38 remaining. Russell hit one with 2:05 left for a 103-101 edge, Towns rebounded a missed deep shot on the other end by Derrick Rose, and Beasley buried one with 1:28 to go to send the Wolves on their way. Josh Jackson (19 points) and Rose (15 points) provided plenty of production off the bench, but the Pistons sputtered down the stretch and were outscored 31-16 in the fourth quarter. Rookie Killian Hayes, one of the team's three first-round draft picks, had three turnovers in the fourth quarter. “That’s what this is for, for him to learn from and get better in those situations,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Blake Griffin, the six-time All-Star, had 15 points and seven rebounds after his 2019-20 season was limited to 18 games by another left knee injury. The first overall pick in the 2009 draft, one of the few prominent players left after the overhaul commissioned by new general manager Troy Weaver, took only one shot in the fourth quarter. Jackson was the standout of a disappointing night. The rest of the Pistons shot 5 for 28 from 3-point range. “That’s part of my role on this team, to come out and spread the floor,” Jackson said. TIP-INS Pistons: Mason Plumlee pitched in 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. He went 7 for 8 from the floor. Timberwolves: Towns and Jarrett Culver (10 points, 10 rebounds) became the first Minnesota pair to record point-rebound double-doubles in a season opener since Kevin Garnett and Rasho Nesterovic in 2002.","401267178"
"Nikola Jokic attacks Marvin Bagley and takes the contact while flipping in the shot. (0:16) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic recorded his standard triple-double but his cohort was on the bench fouled out by overtime and his late-game heroics were a little rusty. Harrison Barnes stole the ball from Jokic with 2.6 seconds left and Buddy Hield tipped in his miss at the buzzer, sending the Sacramento Kings storming off the court with a stunning 124-122 win over the Denver Nuggets in overtime Wednesday night. Jokic recorded a triple-double with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists, but he had a crucial offensive foul with 2.6 seconds left in regulation that denied Denver a chance to win it in regulation and he watched helplessly as Barnes stole the ball in the chaotic closing moments of overtime. Hield led Sacramento with 22 points and Barnes and De’Aaron Fox each added 21 for the Kings, who snapped a six-game skid in Denver, where they had last won on Jan. 3, 2017. Fox also had a key block of Will Barton’s layup with 10.6 seconds remaining in overtime and Barnes grabbed the long rebound and raced downcourt to for a layup that tied it at 122 with 6.5 seconds left. Denver called timeout, but Barnes punched the ball away from Jokic, then raced for a 4-foot dunk that Barton blocked. Hield tipped it in just before the buzzer, then raced off the court and through the tunnel at the newly renamed Ball Arena. Michael Porter Jr. scored 24 points for Denver despite early foul trouble, but playoff star Jamal Murray was held to five points and was 1-for-9 shooting before fouling out late in regulation. “I’d be lying if I told you our defense had a lot to do with that,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “When you’re as good as Jamal Murray and you have a shooting night like that, that’s more him having an off-night. Now, I give our guys credit for competing and making it hard for him. But he sees that every night. “I actually feel bad for whoever has to guard him next time out. I’m assuming he’ll probably have a pretty good game. But our guys did a heck of a job competing.” Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was asked if Murray could match his playoff prowess in the new season, and he used the opportunity to talk about how the team’s first trip to the Western Conference Finals in a decade last summer was already old news. “As great as last season was -- I’m going to keep saying this -- that season is over,” Malone said. “That was a different team. Yes, we have our core back, but we have seven new players. As great as it was to win our division, to get to the Western Conference Finals, to comeback from two 3-1 deficits; starting tonight, who cares? That’s over.” Murray emerged as a bona fide star in the bubbled playoffs in Florida, but Malone said Murray, Jokic and everyone else has to forget about that run now. “We can’t rely on that,” Malone said. “That is ancient history in my eyes. Now, Jamal has a challenge of being that player for 72 games. He did it at a high level for 19 games in the playoffs. Now, this is the beginning of the 2020-2021 season, can Jamal Murray bring it every night and help this team reach even greater heights? “Our goal has still been, we haven’t obtained our goal yet, and that is to win a championship. Jamal is going to be a big part of that.” After the game, Malone pointed to the Kings' 36-24 third quarter as the key to Denver's disappointment, and Jokic concurred, saying, “We relaxed. We played a really good first half. They came out of (halftime) really aggressive with a lot of energy and picked up the tempo of the game. We didn’t match it.” TIP-INS Kings: Corey Joseph had 12 points in 12 minutes off the bench in the first half. ... Sacramento didn't lead at all in the first half, and there was only one tie before halftime, at 7-7. Nuggets: Murray missed all five of his 3-pointers but made all seven of his free throws. ... The Nuggets were outrebounded 53-45 although no Kings reached double digits off the glass (four Sacramento players had nine boards).","401267179"
"Donovan Mitchell feeds it inside to Rudy Gobert and he throws down a dunk on Jusuf Nurkic. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 17 rebounds in a dominant season-opening performance, leading the Utah Jazz to a 120-100 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Gobert controlled the inside and got plenty of support from the outside as Utah shot 19 of 50 from the 3-point line. “It’s fun when we play the way we played tonight,” Gobert said. Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic all made four 3-pointers and Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson knocked down three apiece. Mitchell also scored 20 points. Damian Lillard was scoreless in the first half and finished with only nine points and seven assists for Portland. “They came out from the jump and they were blitzing and trapping. I wasn’t really expecting that,” Lillard said. “But I just didn’t play a good offensive game.” Utah started quickly from outside and pushed its lead to 52-33 with 6:29 left in the first half. The Jazz led by as much as 23 before taking a 64-44 lead at halftime. Lillard was held scoreless in a half for the first time in six seasons. Lillard broke the drought with a layup early in the third quarter. Perhaps no play summed up the night for Portland better than a 3-on-1 break that left Lillard wide open with 31 seconds left, before Lillard took a hesitation dribble and missed the 3-pointer with nobody around him. The frustration extended to his backcourt mate CJ McCollum, who picked up a late technical foul arguing a call in the fourth quarter. McCollum led the Blazers with 23 points. “I don’t think it was for a lack of effort. I think we played hard, we just didn’t play well on both sides of the ball,” McCollum said. Utah’s held the Blazers to barely 40% shooting and had a 59-40 rebounding advantage. It wasn’t just Gobert, but the Jazz had four other players who grabbed at least six rebounds, including Clarkson with seven boards off the bench. TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic played for the first time since March 9. He elected to have wrist surgery in May during the NBA’s hiatus and did not join the team in the NBA bubble. Bogdanovic, who averaged 20 points last season, finished with 15. Blazers: Wednesday was the first game for Portland newcomers Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. Both players are starters for the Blazers. Jones Jr. had a good night shooting the ball, hitting 3 of 5 3-pointers. Covington was 0 for 3 from the field and scoring only one point.","401267180"
"Late in the fourth quarter, Grayson Allen and Trae Young's feet get tangled up causing Young to stumble on the play. (0:25) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Trae Young scored eight straight points down the stretch and finished with 36 points as the Atlanta Hawks beat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-112 Saturday night. Kevin Huerter added 21 points for the Hawks, who won their second straight. De’Andre Hunter finished with 15 points and rookie Nathan Knight added 14 points, going 4 of 5 from the field and 2-for-3 shooting from 3-point range. Ja Morant led Memphis with 28 points and seven assists, and Kyle Anderson finished with 20 points and 14 rebounds. Dillon Brooks added 19 points before fouling out in the closing seconds. Huerter said the goal was to stop the Grizzlies’ transition game and keep them out of the paint, where they are one of the best teams in the league. “For the most part, I think we did a pretty good job at that. We tried to turn a lot of them into shooters,” Huerter said, later adding: “Trying to keep them out of the paint, and we did our thing offensively.” The game was a showdown between two of the league’s top young point guards in Young and Morant, both of whom had big season-openers. Young had 37 points in the Hawks’ 124-104 win at Chicago, while Morant scored a career-high 44 in a home loss to San Antonio. Young, who was limited to 12 points in the first half, scored 10 points in the final 2:40 against the Grizzlies, starting with the eight straight to keep Memphis from overtaking Atlanta. “I think shots just went down,” Young said of the second half. “I was getting some really good looks in that first half. Shots just weren’t going in. For all of us. … I think we got the rust off (in the first half) and played really well as far as scoring throughout the rest of the game.” The young guards carried their teams through the first half, with the Hawks also getting an early burst from Huerter, who had 13 points at the break, hitting all five of his shots. The Hawks held a 58-56 lead at the half. “We’re both young talents trying to be the face of the league,” Morant said. “We’ve played against each other many times. ... The sky’s the limit for (Young).” TIP-INS Hawks: Split a pair of preseason games against the Grizzlies in Memphis. …Starting frontline player Danilo Gallinari did not play due to a left foot contusion. … Knight, who signed a two-way contract with the Hawks after a four-year career at William &amp; Mary, scored his first NBA points in the first quarter. Grizzlies: Reserve G De’Anthony Melton was a late scratch Saturday morning due to health and safety protocols. “In terms of a return date, I’m new to this process,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, adding: “We don’t have a firm timeline yet. It’s to be determined.” ... Kyle Anderson reached 2,000 career points in the first quarter. … Morant reached 500 assists in the second quarter. INJURY KNOWLEDGE: When asked about the availability of certain Hawks injured players, coach Lloyd Pierce candidly said he can only coach the ones available. And that’s how he approaches it. “I never pretend to know about injuries,” the Hawks coach said. “I’ve never sustained an injury in my life, so I don’t pretend to know what an ACL or and MCL or anything else or foot or ankle. I don’t know anything about it, so I don’t try to pretend to know.”","401267181"
