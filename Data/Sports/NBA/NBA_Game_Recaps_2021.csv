"Jae'Sean Tate drives towards the basket, goes behind the back and slams home the impressive dunk. (0:21) James Harden was back in a Houston uniform. It’s still unclear how many more times that’ll happen. The three-time defending NBA scoring champion made his preseason debut with the Rockets on Tuesday night, after starting to practice with his team just one day earlier following a late arrival to training camp amid incessant trade speculation. Harden scored 12 points in 21 minutes and the Rockets beat the San Antonio Spurs 112-98. Harden also had four assists, three rebounds and two steals. He checked out for the final time with 5:02 left in the third quarter, having missed his final four shots. John Wall and Ben McLemore each had 15 points for the Rockets, who got 11 points apiece from Eric Gordon and Jae’Sean Tate and 11 rebounds from DeMarcus Cousins. As expected, Wall and Harden were the starters in the Houston backcourt. “It can be really good,"" first-year Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “To have two dynamic ballhandlers on the floor who can do a bunch of different things, play off each other, create for each other, it can be really, really good."" Harden was not planning to address reporters after the game. “Just happy to see him back out there on the floor,"" McLemore said. Lonnie Walker IV scored 17 for the Spurs, who got 13 points, seven assists and five rebounds from Dejounte Murray. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 12, while Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell each added 11 for San Antonio. Harden seemed anything but disinterested to start his first live game action of the season. He stood immediately to the right of Silas in the pregame huddle, his eyes staring intently at whatever the coach was sketching on a dry-erase clipboard before taking the floor. Harden's first shot was a made straightaway 3-pointer and his second attempt led to him getting fouled from beyond the arc and making three free throws. So, his shooting touch was there, at least at the outset — as was his touch on passes. He connected with Danuel House on a three-quarter-court chest pass to set up a dunk late in the opening quarter, timing clearly not much of an issue after a couple months off. Harden went 3 for 10 from the field, including 2 for 6 from 3-point range. He also went 4 for 5 at the free-throw line. “I thought our young guys played him pretty wisely,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “I think we fouled him one time on a 3-point shot, but that's going to happen with him. He's pretty clever. We were better on him than we were John Wall. I thought John Wall got by us much too often."" Wall said he isn't recruiting Harden to stay in Houston, focusing instead on how they can work best together as teammates now. “He's going to do what's best for him. ... I don't try to ask him about that because that's his personal business,"" Wall said. The Rockets lost guard Chris Clemons with 9:58 left, after he was taken off the court in a wheelchair. Clemons made a 3-pointer for an 87-74 Houston lead, and after retreating to the defensive end for the ensuing possession, appeared to take a bad step and immediately began reaching for his right Achilles area. There was no immediate diagnosis of Clemons’ injury, but given his reaction when it happened and as he was being wheeled off the floor it was reasonable to think that the Rockets were bracing for bad news. “Right when it happened, I knew exactly what it was,"" said Wall, who has dealt with Achilles surgery himself. There are four games Wednesday, followed by seven on Thursday, eight on Friday and then three in the preseason finales Saturday. The regular season begins on Dec. 22. Tuesday’s games: 76ERS 108, CELTICS 99 At Philadelphia, Shake Milton scored 19 points, Joel Embiid added 18 and Tobias Harris finished with 16 points and a game-high nine rebounds for the 76ers in the preseason opener for both clubs. Ben Simmons had 10 points and six assists for Philadelphia. Jeff Teague scored 18 for Boston. He shot 7 for 9 on a night where some Celtics struggled mightily from the field; Jaylen Brown made his first shot and went 0 for 10 the rest of the way, and Jayson Tatum finished just 4 for 13. Payton Pritchard had 12 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for Boston. Tatum finished with 10 points.","401265849"

"Duncan Robinson knocks down a Christmas Day record-tying seven 3-pointers to help the Heat beat the Pelicans. (1:10) MIAMI -- — Erik Spoelstra remained perfect on Christmas, and a record-tying show from Duncan Robinson helped him stay that way. Robinson made seven 3-pointers — tying the Christmas single-game mark — and scored 23 points, helping the Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-98 to start the NBA’s holiday quintupleheader Friday. “It's super special to play in Christmas,"" Robinson said. “I certainly don't take it for granted."" Goran Dragic scored 18 points, Bam Adebayo had 17 and Avery Bradley finished with 12 for Miami, and Spoelstra improved his Christmas record as Heat coach to 8-0. “I wasn't even aware of that,"" Spoelstra said. “Just shows you that we've had some really good teams here and teams that have had the opportunity to play on Christmas."" Precious Achiuwa and Tyler Herro each scored 11 for Miami, which lost Jimmy Butler at halftime with right ankle stiffness. Zion Williamson had 32 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes for New Orleans — the rebounds and minutes both being career highs. Brandon Ingram finished with 28 points. But the Pelicans shot 40% to Miami’s 51%. “We made some defensive mistakes that we shouldn't have,"" said Josh Hart, who scored 12 for New Orleans. “Lack of communication. We've got to communicate better on the defensive end."" Robinson’s seven 3s tied the Christmas mark Ingram set last year. “The guy is a great, great shooter. He's going to have nights like that,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “But at least three of them were ones where we could have done a better job."" JJ Redick’s 3-pointer with 7:43 left cut Miami’s lead to 91-85 and came during a stretch when the Heat went five minutes without a field goal. But the Pelicans got no closer. The Heat restored order by scoring 11 of the game’s next 13 points, and when Achiuwa — the rookie who had strong defensive minutes — forced Williamson into a turnover with 3:55 left, the entire Miami bench rose in celebration. “We knew they would make a run, but we stayed composed,"" Dragic said. New Orleans led 17-9 midway through the opening quarter — and got outscored 52-21 by Miami over the next 13½ minutes, with the Heat hitting nine of their 13 first-half 3s in that span on the way to a 23-point lead. The Pelicans chipped away, getting within 66-53 at the half and 88-79 after three. But New Orleans shot only 30% in the final quarter and Ingram went scoreless in those 12 minutes after playing the entire third period. Van Gundy lamented playing Ingram so much in the third. “Probably not optimal play-calling on my part, either,"" Van Gundy said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson's previous career high was 34 minutes. ... Redick fouled out for the second time in 898 career regular-season games, and missed six of his seven shots. ... The Pelicans are now 1/3 on Christmas. Heat: Andre Iguodala started the second half for Butler. ... Miami improved to 11-2 on Christmas. It hadn’t played on the holiday since beating New Orleans in 2015, and hasn’t lost on Dec. 25 since 2007. SEASON’S GREETINGS Heat forward Moe Harkless this week helped pay rent for about 50 New York families in dire economic circumstances this holiday season, plus covered lost wages and other essential expenses. “Means the world to me,” Harkless said. COMING HOME Veteran ref John Goble was crew chief and got to be home for Christmas; he’s a Miami native. Marc Davis (lives in Chicago, crew chief Friday in Milwaukee) and John Goble (lives in Connecticut, crew chief Friday in Boston) also got to work near home for Christmas.","401266794"
"Kawhi Leonard goes for 23 points and Paul George adds 21 in the Clippers' 121-108 win vs. the Nuggets. (2:21) DENVER -- — Kawhi Leonard was hurt and the Denver Nuggets were mounting a rally like they did three months ago. This time, the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t allow Denver to complete the comeback. Leonard had 21 points before taking an elbow to the face in the fourth quarter, Paul George scored 23 points and had nine assists, and Los Angeles beat the Nuggets 121-108 on Friday night. It was the second straight big win for LA, which beat the Lakers on Tuesday night. “We’re a different team than last year,” George said. The Clippers led by 11 with 6:11 left Friday night when Serge Ibaka went up for a rebound and caught the side of his teammate’s face with his right elbow. Leonard lay bleeding on the court before walking to the locker room. “He got up and walked off the floor, so he’s going to be good,” LA coach Tyronn Lue said. Leonard was ruled out shortly thereafter and was being evaluated postgame, but it did put a scare into George. “Really worried. I was thinking the worst,” George said. “I didn’t know if he was concussed or what actually happened, I just saw him laying on the ground. That was first and foremost, making sure he was OK.” The Clippers didn’t need Leonard to close out a Nuggets team that upset them in the second round of the Western Conference semifinals last season. Nikola Jokic finished with 24 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds for Denver, which has dropped its first two games of the season. Jamal Murray added 23 points, 13 coming in the fourth. The Nuggets rallied from double-digit second-half deficits in Games 5, 6 and 7 of the second-round series in September, winning all three and wiping out LA’s 3-1 lead to advance to the Western Conference finals. It was a surprising end for a team many thought could beat the Lakers and advance to the NBA Finals. George said he has put that disappointment in the past. “I buried last year, left last year in the bubble,” he said. “This is a new season, new team, new goals, new everything. I was ready and poised and confident coming into this year, and I was prepared coming into this season.” Denver wasn’t able to do it again but made a run after trailing by 24 late in the third quarter. The Nuggets used an 11-0 run into early in the fourth, and two 3-pointers by Murray sliced a 98-74 deficit to 106-95 with 7:35 left. “When you’re down 25, it’s about pride and about effort,” Murray said. “We wanted to play hard and let the lead take care of itself. We saw the lead chip away like we did in the playoffs, we just couldn’t get over the hump.” Leonard went out soon after but Denver never got the deficit under 10. “They made a run, we lost Kawhi so we could have lost our composure, lost our game, but we took a good timeout,” Nicolas Batum said. “We kept moving the ball and made big shots.” TIP-INS Clippers: F Marcus Morris (sore right knee) missed his second straight game, but coach Lue said he is day-to-day. “He’s been doing his own rehab with the sports science team and he’s progressing,” Lue said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green sat out with a left calf strain. Green, who played for the Clippers last season, has yet to play in the regular season after signing with Denver in the short offseason. SCROOGED AGAIN Denver was playing on Christmas night for the second straight season, with both ending in double-digit losses. Last year the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Nuggets 112-100 in Denver, stopping a seven-game winning streak. “Two years in a row we weren’t ready to play on Christmas night,” coach Michael Malone said. “Bah humbug.”","401266795"

"Steph Curry drains a 3-pointer in the second quarter to pass Rick Barry for second on Golden State's all-time scoring list. (0:23) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton scored 31 points and the Milwaukee Bucks routed the Golden State Warriors 138-99 on Friday to win their first Christmas Day home game in over half a century. Middleton went 10 of 15 overall and 6 for 8 from 3-point range, leading a strong performance from deep for his team. He totaled 58 points in his first two games of the season. “The weeks before the season, I just tried to put in good work, work on my game,” Middleton said. “So far, it's been working for me.” Milwaukee was 20 of 37 on 3-point attempts, while Golden State was 10 of 45. The Warriors were outscored by 65 points in their first two games, the second-highest total in NBA history through two games to 71 points for the 1987-88 Clippers. Golden State lost 125-99 at Brooklyn in its season opener. This was the second-most lopsided score of any Christmas Day game in NBA history. The Syracuse Nationals beat the New York Knicks 162-100 on Dec. 25, 1960. “The thing I was most disappointed in is we just had two good days of practice with our execution working on getting in our offense and making hard cuts and reads, and we did not execute much of anything,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “It was kind of scattered and disorganized. I'm disappointed in that. I've got to take the blame for that. I'm the head coach.” Milwaukee's only other Christmas home game came during the franchise’s inaugural season in 1968. The Bucks were on the road for Christmas the last two seasons, losing at Philadelphia in 2019 and winning at New York in 2018. Bucks players got a Christmas surprise before the game when they received videotaped messages from their families in a move orchestrated by team officials. “It was definitely the best gift that I got today,” Bucks guard Jrue Holiday said. Then they went out and delivered a dominant performance to bounce back from a season-opening  122-121 loss at Boston  in which Celtics star Jayson Tatum banked in a go-ahead 3-pointer and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw in the final second. Antetkounmpo had 15 points and 13 rebounds against Golden State, but the two-time reigning NBA MVP shot 4 of 15 from the floor and 7 of 15 from the foul line. Stephen Curry scored 19 points for Golden State, and rookie James Wiseman had 18. Andrew Wiggins had 12. Jordan Poole and Brad Wanamaker added 11 each. Donte DiVincenzo and D.J. Augustin each scored 13 for Milwaukee. Holiday had 12 and Bobby Portis added 10. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green sat out for the second straight game because of a sore right foot. … This marked the 12th time Kerr was part of a Christmas Day game. He has played in five and coached in seven. … The Warriors dropped to 13-17 in Christmas Day games. This was their eighth straight Christmas Day appearance. Bucks: Augustin made his Bucks debut after sitting out the Celtics game due to a strained left calf. The 33-year-old Augustin signed with the Bucks last month after spending the last four seasons with Orlando. CURRY MILESTONE WATCH Curry increased his career points total to 16,458, overtaking Rick Barry (16,447) to move into second place on the Warriors' list. Wilt Chamberlain holds the franchise record after scoring 17,783 points for the Warriors. Curry was 2 of 10 from 3-point range to give him 2,499 career 3-pointers. The two-time MVP is looking to join Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) as the only NBA players to make at least 2,500 3-pointers. Curry went 5 of 5 from the line to extend his streak of consecutive successful free-throw attempts to 55. He is chasing Barry's franchise record of 60 straight from 1976-77.","401266797"
"Kevin Durant throws the lob up to DeAndre Jordan for the slam, then on the next possession Kyrie Irving puts in the impressive transition layup. (0:30) BOSTON -- — Kyrie Irving scored 37 points with eight assists in his return to Boston and Kevin Durant added 29 for Brooklyn on Friday to lead the Nets to a 123-95 victory over the Celtics. Jarrett Allen added 11 rebounds for the Nets, who remained perfect so far this season and sent Boston to its first loss. Irving was 7 of 10 from 3-point range in his first regular-season game at TD Garden since he opted out of his Celtics contract in 2019. “We’re going to continue to see them. We’re in the same division,” Irving said, adding that there was “nothing added” to his motivation in playing his former team. Jaylen Brown scored 27 with eight rebounds for the Celtics and Jayson Tatum had 20 points and eight boards. The Celtics beat Milwaukee in their opener on Wednesday on Tatum's last-second shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo, but they couldn't do it again in their second straight matchup against a team expected to contend in the Eastern Conference this season. “The benefit of playing these two games against two other great teams is that it forces you to be better,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""It tests you to see where you’re at, it sets the bar, and now you know what you have to strive for.” The game began after a moment of silence for former Celtics player and coach K.C. Jones, who died earlier Friday. Durant scored 16 points in the third quarter, when the Nets outscored Boston 35-23 to turn a three-point deficit into an 86-77 lead. He scored nine straight Brooklyn points at the beginning of the third when the Nets took the lead for good. ""It’s still impressive to watch after all these years,"" Nets coach Steve Nash said. “For him to have little runs like that is nothing in his mind. For mere mortals in the NBA, it’s impossible to think of.” Boston led by three at the half before being outscored 35-23 in the third quarter, including a 9-0 run that turned a three-point edge into a 82-70 lead. It was 86-79 early in the fourth when the Nets, even with Irving and Durant on the bench, again scored nine in a row to open a 16-point lead. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn has beaten the Warriors with Klay Thompson and Draymond Green sitting out and the Celtics with Kemba Walker injured. “We just need to stay hungry. This means nothing,” Nash said. ... It was Durant’s 10th visit to the TD Garden in 14 seasons -- his fewest in any NBA city. Celtics: Jeff Teague was perfect from 3-point range in the exhibition season and 4 for 4 in the regular season opener before missing his first in the third quarter on Friday. ... Tatum scored zero points in the first quarter and 12 in the second. ... Tatum’s passed Walter McCarty and moved into eighth place on the Celtics’ all-time 3-pointer list, with (418). Isaiah Thomas is seventh with 460 and Paul Pierce is first with 1,823. ... Celtics coach Brad Stevens was called for a technical foul arguing about a foul call against Daniel Theis in the second quarter.","401266798"
"LeBron James jokes about how he has to drink wine to alter his free throw shooting, especially after an air ball at the line tonight. (0:44) LOS ANGELES -- — When LeBron James checked the stat sheet as he left the Staples Center court after his latest high-scoring Christmas victory, he realized the Lakers had scored 138 points with a mere 22 from him. The NBA champions already look like they could be even better this year. In their second game of the new season, even Luka Doncic didn't stand a chance of keeping up. Anthony Davis scored 28 points and James became the second-leading Christmas scorer in NBA history during the Los Angeles Lakers' 138-115 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. Montrezl Harrell scored 17 of his 22 points in the second half, and Dennis Schröder had 18 points and six assists in a second strong game for both new additions to the champs. Los Angeles outrebounded Dallas 53-27 and closed out its first win of the season with a dominant fourth quarter. “We have the ability to where we can have four, maybe even five guys that can score in the 20s any given night,” James said. “As long as we defend and we’re efficient, it’s a beautiful thing to see.” Doncic had 27 points and seven assists in his first starring role in the NBA’s showcase Christmas evening game for Dallas. Josh Richardson and Trey Burke had 17 points apiece as the Mavs started 0-2 with a late fade. Dallas' three offensive rebounds were fewer than Harrell, who had five. “You can’t win a game where the second-chance points are 35-0,” Doncic said. “It’s as simple as that. We box out, we win the game."" The Lakers were aggressive and accurate from the opening tip, taking a 69-57 halftime lead while hitting 61.4% of their shots. Doncic went 3 for 10 in the first half but combined with Burke for 22 points in the third quarter to keep it close. “The more we play with each other, the more we’re going to figure things out,” Davis said. “We prided ourselves on not losing two in a row last year, so we wanted to come out and make sure we do that.” HOLIDAY CHEERS James moved into second place behind Kobe Bryant for the most points scored on Christmas, passing Oscar Robertson in the third quarter. James has 383 points in 15 games on Christmas, while Bryant had 395 in 16 holiday appearances. TIP-INS Mavericks: Kristaps Porzingis is on the Mavericks’ trip while recovering from knee surgery in October. Coach Rick Carlisle said the Latvian big man is “making progress all the time. I’m confident in saying it’s weeks, not months (before his return, but that’s all I’m going to tell you. He has a ways to go.” ... This was Dallas' only scheduled meeting with the Lakers this season. Lakers: Davis was accidentally elbowed in the face by Burke in the first quarter. He had a split lip, but stayed in. ... ESPN reported Schröder has already opened contract extension talks with LA, and the German guard confirmed he would “love to” sign a long-term deal: “It's just got to be fair on both sides.” ... Wesley Matthews, Marc Gasol and Alfonzo McKinnie all scored their first points for the Lakers after going scoreless in the opener. ... They wore powder-blue warmups over their silver-on-white Christmas uniforms with blue accents.","401266799"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo says he's upset he missed the tying free throw but hopes to learn from it moving forward. (1:29) BOSTON -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn't stop Jayson Tatum from knocking down a “tough, tough, tough” shot. Then the reigning MVP and defensive player of the year missed one of the easiest. Tatum banked in a fallaway, go-ahead 3-pointer in the final second, and Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw with 0.4 seconds left, allowing the Boston Celtics to escape with a 122-121 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night in the teams' season opener. “Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be in that position,” said Tatum, who scored 30 points. “If it goes down or not, that’s what I work so hard for. You just want to be in that moment.” Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for Boston, which entered the fourth quarter leading by 17 points. The Celtics trailed 120-119 when Tatum dribbled the clock down from 8.9 seconds before lofting a high-arcing 3 over Antetokounmpo  that kissed the glass on its way down. “I think aside from the ball going in the basket, I’m not sure we could have defended Tatum much better than we did,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I thought Giannis did a great job individually, great contest. Credit to Tatum, he banked in a 3 at the end of the clock.” Antetokounmpo called it a “tough, tough, tough 3.” Tatum said the glass wasn't really part of the plan. “Once I let it go I knew it was going to hit the backboard,” he said. “But I didn’t necessarily try.” The ensuing inbounds pass was thrown at the rim and Antetokounmpo tried to tip it in, but he was fouled. He made the first foul shot, but bounced the second off the front of the rim. “Obviously, there’s a bit of a weight on your shoulder because you know if you miss, that’s it for your team,"" said Antetokounmpo, who scored 18 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter. “I’m a winner. I want to do whatever it takes for my team to win. But you learn from every situation that basketball puts you in.” Khris Middleton had 27 points and 14 rebounds and big offseason acquisition Jrue Holiday scored 25 points for Milwaukee. The Bucks had the best record in the NBA in each of the past two seasons but didn’t make it out of the Eastern Conference finals. Milwaukee led by nine points, 48-39, midway through the second quarter before Boston rolled off 10 straight points and 19 of the next 23. Boston led 101-84 after three, but Antetokounmpo outscored the Celtics 10-2 over a two-minute span midway through the fourth to cut a 10-point Celtics lead to 109-107. “We took a good hit and kept ticking,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. TOMMY POINT The Celtics observed a moment of silence for Tommy Heinsohn before the game and played a tribute video at the first break for the player, coach and broadcaster who was with the team for more than 60 years and all 17 of its NBA titles. Heinsohn, who died last month at the age of 86, won eight championships in nine years as a Celtics player from 1956-65. He won three more titles as a coach and was the fourth person inducted in the basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. The Celtics lowered eight of their championship banners courtside, picking the ones they deemed to have special meaning to Heinsohn. TIP-INS Bucks: During the game, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on guard Donte DiVincenzo for the 2021-22 season. DiVincenzo had 15 points and five assists. Celtics: Newcomers Jeff Teague scored 19 points in 25 minutes, and Tristan Thompson had 12 points and eight rebounds.","401266804"
"Steph Curry goes for 20 points and 10 assists in his first regular-season game since March as Golden State falls to Brooklyn on opening night. (1:41) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant shook off 18 months of rust in a matter of minutes. Durant looked good as new against his old team, Kyrie Irving was even better and the Brooklyn Nets emphatically kicked off the Steve Nash era with a 125-99 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night in the NBA's season opener. Durant finished with 22 points in 25 minutes of his first official game since rupturing his Achilles tendon while playing for Golden State in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. It's a new start for Durant, but he did the same things he's been doing for years. “I tried not to make too big a deal out of this whole thing and realize I’ve been playing this game since I was 8 years old, so just got to revert back to what I know,” Durant said. Irving led Brooklyn with 26 points and Caris LeVert scored 20 as the Nets led by as many as 38, pouring on the points the way the Phoenix Suns did when Nash was their point guard, or more recently Golden State did when Durant was their All-Star forward. The Nets made the playoffs last season but now are expected to contend for the Eastern Conference title after finally getting Durant and Irving on the court together. They used the first game of the shortened, 72-game season to prove they might be worth the hype. “I think our goals are a lot higher this year and we just want to be able to come in and dominate and do that consistently,” Irving said. Stephen Curry had 20 points and 10 assists for the Warriors, a depleted team that looks nothing like the powerhouse that won two titles in Durant's three seasons there. Durant left shortly after having surgery following his injury and was expected to sit out the entire 2019-20 season even before it was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Teammates who have worked out with him said the four-time scoring champion was back in top form and Durant quickly backed up their boasts in a mostly empty Barclays Center. He made his first three shots, one a 3-pointer and another while being fouled, and was in double figures in fewer than five minutes. He did everything but keep up with Irving, who made three 3-pointers and had 17 points in 9 1/2 minutes of the opening quarter, when the Nets led by as many as 21. Irving, himself coming back from injury after playing just 20 games last season because of shoulder problems, had Brooklyn’s last two baskets of the first half, including a deep 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds left that made it 63-45. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he was happy for Durant but upset with what he saw from his team, trying to bounce back after winning a league-low 15 games last season. “Both Kevin and Kyrie just kind of had their way in the first half,"" he said. ""So the lack of physicality and competition were the most disappointing things.” Durant then scored 10 more in Brooklyn's 36-point third quarter, ending his night for good late in the period. No. 2 pick James Wiseman started at center despite his limited preparation and had 19 points and six rebounds. But the Warriors, playing without Draymond Green because of a sore right foot, need to find more shooting around Curry with Klay Thompson set to miss a second straight season. Andrew Wiggins was 4 for 16 for his 13 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. was 3 for 14. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said Green planned an individual workout Tuesday and would hopefully do some group work Wednesday when they remained in New York to practice. ... Wiseman, at 19 years, 266 days, became the third-youngest Golden State player to start a game behind Andris Biedrins (18, 352) and Anthony Randolph (19, 179). ...

They are 1-0 for the first time since Nov. 3, 2012, their first game at Barclays Center after moving from New Jersey. ... Brooklyn re-signed G Chris Chiozza to a two-way contract Tuesday. He played in 18 games for the Nets last season. ... The Nets honored the essential workers who have helped New York fight the coronavirus, raising a banner on one end of Barclays Center.

"The Clippers are fueled by Paul George scoring 33 points on 13-of-18 shooting from the field as they go on to defeat the Lakers on opening night 116-109. (2:15) LOS ANGELES -- - After the Los Angeles Lakers got their championship rings, the Los Angeles Clippers gave a performance that showed this retooled team is determined to contend for its own jewelry several months from now. Paul George scored 26 of his 33 points in the second half, Kawhi Leonard added 26 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied past the Los Angeles Lakers on the NBA champions' ring ceremony night for a 116-109 victory Tuesday. George went 13 of 18 with five 3-pointers in an outstanding first game since agreeing to add four years and $190 million to his contract with the Clippers, who never trailed in the latest meeting of Southern California's two NBA powerhouses. The Clippers beat the Lakers in the season opener for the second straight year while winning coach Tyronn Lue's debut. The Clippers stayed in their locker room while the Lakers received their rings, but they emerged with purpose and determined play - from their two superstars in particular. ""Our focus was on us,"" Lue said. ""The Lakers, they deserved that ring. They had a great year, and you can't take nothing away from them. Our focus wasn't really on the Lakers. They were the best team last year, so congratulations to them again, but now we're moving on."" LeBron James scored 22 points and Anthony Davis had 18 for the Lakers just 72 days after they finished off the Miami Heat in the NBA bubble. James said he turned his ankle ""pretty good"" in the second half, leading him to play just 28 minutes. ""I'm happy today is over with and we can focus on the season, but it's just a lot to process,"" James said. ""It felt weird having a basketball game today."" The Lakers returned from the shortest offseason in league history and celebrated  the franchise's 17th title, but they couldn't keep up with George and Leonard down the stretch. Lakers coach Frank Vogel also limited James' playing time and kept Davis to 31 minutes, anticipating the long grind ahead on his veterans after a 10-week offseason. ""It's not ideal, but I do feel it's necessary to manage those guys' minutes the right way,"" Vogel said. ""Getting through this stretch healthy is a priority, and evaluating how our new guys fit is a priority when we haven't had a normal amount of time to do that. The five guys on the floor have got to be better than they were tonight."" Serge Ibaka scored 15 points in his debut for the Clippers, who hadn't played since blowing a 3-1 playoff series lead to Denver and ruining a much-anticipated conference final showdown with the waiting Lakers in the bubble. The collapse led to coach Doc Rivers' departure, and Lue moved down the bench to take over a star-studded team with several new additions. The Lakers fell behind by 22 points under the ring hangover in the first quarter, but they erased all but two points of the deficit in the second. The Clippers pulled away late in the third with George scorching a series of one-on-one defenders. He scored 11 more points in the fourth to seal it. ""We're not thinking about last year,"" Leonard said. ""It's a different team. I'm just happy that we kept playing basketball the right way. Even if we lost the lead, we turned around and kept playing our basketball. We ran our offense, and that's what we take pride in tonight. Everybody had each other's back and was staying positive."" TIP-INS Clippers: Nicolas Batum and Ibaka started for their new club. ... Former Lakers Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac scored 11 points apiece. Lakers: James believes he will be fine to play on Christmas, saying he'll get extensive treatment. He also joked about another solution: ""I'll drink some wine that will flow right to the ankle."" ... Dennis Schröder and fellow newcomer Marc Gasol were in Vogel's starting lineup. Gasol had no points and five fouls in 12 minutes. ... Wesley Matthews also went scoreless in his Lakers debut. DEBUTS Batum had three points and six assists in 28 minutes in his Clippers debut, while new $64 million swingman Luke Kennard had four points in 21 minutes off the bench. Montrezl Harrell had 17 points and 10 rebounds in a strong debut after moving down the hallway from the Clippers to the Lakers last month. Schröder also was impressive in his Lakers debut, with 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. ""Those guys are going to be big-time players for us,"" Vogel said.","401266806"

"Damantas Sabonis goes for 32 points as the Pacers win their season opener vs. the Knicks 121-107. (2:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Victor Oladipo took matters into his own hands after a sluggish first half Wednesday night. He drove to the basket, made shots and wound up scoring 16 of his 22 points in the final 24 minutes to lead the Indiana Pacers past the New York Knicks 121-107 on opening night. “He wanted to be assertive in that second half,"" new coach Nate Bjorkgren said after collecting his first career win. “I thought he was very aggressive, attacking the basket more, looking to shoot it more. I liked his aggressive mentality on both ends of the floor."" Domantas Sabonis finished with a career-high 32 points, along with 13 rebounds and five assists to help Indiana win its fourth opener in five years. RJ Barrett finished with 26 points and Alec Burks had 22 for New York, which lost on opening night for the fourth time in five years and the first time in coach Tom Thibodeau's tenure. And after a strong start, Thibodeau certainly expected a stronger finishing punch from his team. “The way we played in the first half is the way we need to continue to play,"" he said. “We probably played 24 minutes of good basketball and to win on the road, you have to do more than that."" It wasn't pretty and with only a few dozen people in the Bankers Life Fieldhouse stands, the energy was lacking, too. But Oladipo's opening outburst in the second half changed everything. The two-time All-Star scored the Pacers' first 11 points in the third quarter then found T.J. Warren for a breakaway layup to give the Pacers a 78-77 lead with 5:50 left in the quarter. Indiana never trailed again. The Pacers extended the margin to 83-77 after three, made it a double-digit game early in the fourth and pulled away midway through the fourth. “I’m just going to go out there and be assertive, be aggressive,"" Oladipo said. “Everything else will take care of itself."" TIP-INS Knicks: Barrett played a nearly perfect first half, going 8 of 8 from the field, 3 of 3 on 3s and 1 of 2 at the free throw line. He finished 11 of 15 from the field. ... No. 8 pick Obi Toppin had nine points on 3-of-12 shooting in his NBA debut. ... Mitchell Robinson, who broke the league's single-season field goal percentage record last season, struggled with fouls all night and was 1 of 2 from the field with three points. ... Julius Randle had 17 points and nine rebounds. ... The Knicks had 16 turnovers. Pacers: T.J. Warren, who was so impressive in the bubble, wasn't himself after returning from a foot injury.

Malcolm Brogdon had 21 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. ... Indiana had a 49-40 rebounding advantage. HURTING Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley's debut didn't last long. The 25th overall pick in last month's draft played just 12 minutes and took only three shots before leaving with a hip pointer. He finished with five points, one rebound, one assist and one steal — and his status for Game 2 is unclear, too. “He’ll be examined (Wednesday and Thursday),"" Thibodeau said. “He had a great impact when he went into the game in the first half.

"Nikola Vucevic sends a beautiful assist to Evan Fournier who cuts backdoor to the hoop for an and-1 in the final minute of action. (0:20) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — For a third time in the past four years, the Orlando Magic opened their season on their home court with a stirring victory beat the rival Miami Heat. Clearly, though, it will take more than just a victory over the defending Eastern Conference champion Heat for the Magic to back up forward Aaron Gordon’s bold talk of the team being ""overlooked.’’ Evan Fournier hit a go-ahead 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter, converted a three-point play off another driving layup in the final minute and scored 25 points in the Magic’s 113-107 victory over Miami on Wednesday. ""It was a good win and you always want to win the first game, especially when it’s at home,’’ said Fournier, who scored nine points in the final period for Orlando. ""It’s definitely rewarding to win against a team like Miami because it’s always tough to play against them.’’ The Sunshine State rivals opened the regular season against one another for the sixth time. Oddly, the two rivals have started their seasons in Orlando four times in the past five years. The Magic are 5-1 in their six openers against their rivals from South Florida. Bam Adebayo led Miami with 25 points and 11 rebounds, Goran Dragic added 20 points, and Jimmy Butler had 19 points and seven assists. The Heat turned the ball over 22 times, leading to 24 Magic points. ""One, empty possessions. Two, we didn’t get the necessary ball movement … and thirdly, (the Magic) are a good defensive team,’’ said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra’s, whose team was playing for the first time since losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals in October. Miami led 83-79 after three periods and it was up 93-91 with 4:29 to play following Adebayo's dunk. However, Fournier soon after swung the momentum to the Magic’s side with his strong finish. Fournier, who is looking to bounce back this season after struggling in last season’s playoffs, made all three of his shots in the fourth quarter. Gordon had 20 points and seven rebounds, Terrence Ross chipped in 19 and Nikola Vucevic added 15 points and 11 rebounds. Point guard Markelle Fultz added 15 points and made two clutch free throws with 1:11 to play. Gordon is confident that the Magic can open some eyes with their play this season. ""I don’t think, outside of Orlando, people have a lot of belief in us,’’ said the forward, who made 8 of 11 shots. ""I don’t think they think that we’re going to become potential contenders or even have a playoff slot and I don’t think that’s true. I feel like we’re really ready to make that next leap.’’ TIP-INS Heat: Dragic, who played well despite struggling with a foot injury much of training camp, was upset with his team’s hustle. ""We talked and thought we did not play hard enough,’’ Dragic said. ""This is what we need to correct.’’ Magic: The Magic held a moment of silence prior to tipoff to honor franchise co-founder Jimmy Hewitt. He died last month at the age of 79. Hewitt, along with Pat Williams, helped bring the NBA in the 1989-90 season.","401267152"
"Russell Westbrook scores 21 points, while dishing 15 assists and bringing in 11 rebounds vs. the 76ers. (1:29) PHILADELPHIA -- — The 76ers have gone more than a year without losing in Philadelphia, a stretch that included a coaching change, a roster revamp, and a pandemic hiatus. The constant? Joel Embiid simply dominant down the stretch. Embiid scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 113-107 win over Washington on Wednesday night and spoil Russell Westbrook’s triple-double Wizards’ debut. The Sixers haven’t lost at home since Dec. 20, 2019. Westbrook and Bradley Beal were fantastic in spurts in the opening-night backcourt pairing that nearly handed 76ers coach Doc Rivers a loss in his Philadelphia debut. Westbrook had 21 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds to wow the Wizards after being acquired in the big deal that sent former cornerstone John Wall to the Houston Rockets. Beal, a two-time All-Star who was second in the league in scoring last season, had 31 points. “Not good enough. I’m kind of disappointed in myself,” Westbrook said. “There were plays where I could have had a better game.” Embiid, sensational in the fourth, and Shake Milton, who scored 19 points off the bench, were the go-to scorers late, and Ben Simmons sealed the win with a monster dunk in the waning moments. Simmons had 16 points — one less than Embiid scored in the fourth. “He’s the focal point. The ball is going to Embiid on every single play,” Beal said. “He’s a hassle down there.” Embiid was nearly unstoppable in the post in the fourth, getting the ball on five straight possessions at one point and turning them into buckets that wiped out a 10-point deficit. His driving layup with 1:09 left put the Sixers up 105-103, and he finished 10 of 17 from the floor. “I don’t think anybody can stop me, especially with the mentality I have this year,” Embiid said. The Sixers made their major change on the bench, hiring Rivers to replace Brett Brown and wake up a team that was swept out of the first round of the playoffs last year. Rivers has to find a way to make the Embiid-Simmons pairing work — two All-Stars who have yet to get the most of their prodigious talents and have frustrated fans with their flaws. Simmons showed an early willingness to try and fix his — making shots from beyond 15 feet. Simmons was encouraged by new teammate Dwight Howard, who won a ring last season with the Lakers, to stick around postgame and work on his shooting. Both players stayed on the court and Howard waved toward the stands — mostly security guards and team employees — to get louder during a shooting drill. Simmons was the subject of trade rumors, though new head decision maker Daryl Morey said the guard was not on the trading block. “Dwight’s been pushing me to get better. He wants me to be great,” Simmons said. “I really appreciate that. It makes you want to work.” TIP-INS Wizards: Israeli teen Deni Avdija scored seven points in his NBA debut for the Wizards. The 19-year-old was the ninth overall pick in the draft and had played for the Tel Aviv Maccabi club in Israel’s Premier League. “I know he’s only 19 years old but he plays with a passion, plays with a determination that I like,” coach Scott Brooks said. ... Beal and Westbrook each had six turnovers and Washington had 20 overall. 76ers: The 76ers bench largely outplayed the starters. Howard had 10 rebounds, Furkan Korkmaz scored 11 points and first-round pick Tyrese Maxey was a burst of energy early and had six points. SIR CHARLES PREDICTS TNT analyst Charles Barkley played with Brooks and roomed with him, too, when they played for the 76ers. Barkley put some pressure on his old teammate when he predicted the Wizards would make the playoffs. “I’ll tell you what, he’s guaranteed a lot and very rarely it comes through,” Brooks said. “My job is to take care of my former roommate and pay him back. ... Hopefully, we can have a good year and make the playoffs. I like our chances.” Brooks is entering the final season of his five-year, $35 million contract. THAT’S ENTERTAINMENT The 76ers had drummers, the cheer team held signs that read “Make Some Noise,” a DJ blasted music and the mascot Franklin roasted the Wizards with humorous signs to liven up an empty Wells Fargo Center.","401267173"
"Zion Williamson climbs the ladder and gets a big block on OG Anunoby. (0:23) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Toronto Raptors had their home floor shipped 1,300 miles when they relocated to Tampa for at least the start of the NBA season. Yet it was the New Orleans Pelicans who looked at home at Amalie Arena in the season opener for both teams. JJ Redick converted a four-point play with just over a minute remaining and finished with 23 points, and Brandon Ingram led all scorers with 24 points as the Pelicans rallied from an 11-point deficit and beat the Raptors 113-99 on Wednesday night. Zion Williamson had a big second half for the Pelicans and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams scored 18 and 16 points, respectively, in their first games with the Pelicans, who delivered new coach Stan Van Gundy a victory in his New Orleans debut. “I’d say that we fought very hard in a game that was very, very frustrating,” Van Gundy said. “We were turning the ball over, we were in foul trouble, not a lot was going right for us. We hung in there and kept fighting and then made enough plays and enough shots to pull away.” Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 20 points. Kyle Lowry finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Because of the current Canadian restrictions on cross-border travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Raptors are scheduled to play their first 17 “home” games at Tampa’s Amalie Arena. The second half of the NBA’s schedule will be released later. Lowry hit four 3-pointers in the second quarter, and when Siakam made consecutive 3-pointers, the Raptors opened their largest lead of the game at 11 points. Redick hit a couple 3s late in the second period, but the Pelicans went into the break trailing 57-50. Ingram spoke on the importance of Redick to the Pelicans. “He’s good to have around from a professionalism standpoint, so we like to have him around,” Ingram said. “We love that he can shoot the basketball and when he’s open he needs the basketball.” Early in the second half, Lonzo Ball and Bledsoe hit 3-pointers in a 9-0 run. Then, Ball and Ingram did all the scoring for the Pelicans on a 10-2 run that finished the third quarter and gave the Pelicans an 88-79 lead. They scored 38 points in the period. <U+2033>(The third quarter) ... zapped our energy pretty big time,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “We did seem to lose a little energy and maybe ran out of a little gas, too.” About 3,800 people attended the game, and Siakam said fans in the stands makes a difference. “I don’t know if it’s all Raptors fans or what the case might be, but I thought it was cool, just having people around it,” Siakam said. “Obviously we’re blessed that we have some people, some type of energy in the crowd to make the atmosphere a little better.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson, who averaged only 27.8 minutes over 24 games in an injury-filled rookie season, went to the bench with three fouls with 8:10 left in the first half. He did play 30 minutes. ... New Orleans shot 52.5% in the game and hada 45-35 rebound advantage. Raptors: The loss ended Toronto’s seven-game win streak in season openers. ... It was Lowry’s ninth straight opening-day start for the Raptors. ... The Raptors have seven undrafted players on their season-opening roster.","401267174"
"Trae Young throws an alley-oop from half court to John Collins who goes up to throw down a one-handed dunk to cap the fast break for the Hawks. (0:19) CHICAGO -- — Trae Young was tough to stop in his first two NBA seasons. Surrounded by more talent than ever before, he could become a nightmare for the league in his third year. Young scored 37 points and the revamped Atlanta Hawks pounded Chicago 124-104 on Wednesday night, spoiling Billy Donovan's debut as Bulls coach. “Just being able to go out there and put on a show in the first game was really good,” Young said. “Not every night obviously is going to be like this, but it's really good to have an opening game like this.” Atlanta shot 54% (43 for 80) from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Cam Reddish had 15 points and John Collins finished with 14. “All of our guys played well. All of our guys played together,” coach Lloyd Pierce said. Looking for their first playoff berth since 2017, the Hawks signed Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn during free agency. Rondo and Dunn were held out on opening night, but Bogdanovic had 15 points and seven rebounds, and Gallinari scored 13. While the newcomers could give Atlanta a big lift, the dynamic Young remains the engine that drives the Hawks. He seemingly scored at will against the Bulls, going 10 for 12 from the field, 5 for 6 from 3-point range and 12 for 14 at the line. He also had seven assists and six rebounds in just 26 minutes. “The way we spaced, it opened up a lot of driving lanes and gaps to the rim for either shots at the rim or if they helped, we had shooters open,” Young said. Chicago cleaned out its front office and fired coach Jim Boylen after it went 22-43 last year during its third consecutive losing season. Donovan was hired in September, and it looks as if he has quite the job ahead of him. Zach LaVine scored 22 points and Lauri Markkanen had 21 points and seven rebounds in a solid start to an important season for the 23-year-old forward. But the Bulls struggled defensively and were careless with the ball at times, finishing with 17 turnovers. “We did not help each other well enough defensively,” Donovan said. Patrick Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in this year's draft, had 16 points for Chicago in his NBA debut. The 19-year-old Williams became the youngest player in Bulls history to start their first game of the season. Young led the way as Atlanta grabbed control in the first half. He found Collins for an alley-oop jam that made it 66-46 with 4:49 left. He had 27 points on 7-for-9 shooting at the break, helping the Hawks to an 83-59 halftime lead. “We just didn't come to play as a team,” Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr. said. TIP-INS Hawks: Dunn (right knee) missed the game against his former team. Dunn played for the Bulls for the past three seasons before signing a $10 million, two-year contract with the Hawks in free agency. “He's just at a point where he's trying to get right,” Pierce said. “He's been doing some non-contact activity.” ... C Clint Capela (left Achilles soreness) and Rondo (health and safety protocols) also were held out. Asked if it could be a lingering issue with Capela, Pierce said: “No, I just thought he was sore.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young missed the opener because of an infection in his lower left leg. ... Donovan didn't reveal his starters until right before his first game. He went with Williams, Markkanen, LaVine, Carter, and Coby White, but he said staying flexible is important this year because of COVID-19 protocols. “I think we've got to do a good job, players and coaches, of making sure we're all staying ready,"" he said. ROOKIES While Williams started in his NBA debut, Atlanta rookie Onyeka Okongwu was sidelined by a foot injury. Okongwu, a 6-foot-9 center from Southern California who was selected by the Hawks with the No. 6 pick in the draft, will be re-evaluated on Monday, the day of Atlanta’s home opener against Detroit.","401267175"
"Ja Morant stuns the Spurs with an impressive dunk after throwing the ball off the glass to himself for a two-handed slam. (0:29) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and nine assists, Dejounte Murray added 21 points as the San Antonio Spurs used a balanced attack to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 131-119 on Wednesday night, overcoming a huge game by Ja Morant. Morant -- the reigning rookie of the year -- had 34 of his career-high 44 points in the second half. While that helped carry the Grizzlies offensively, it wasn’t enough to put a deep dent in San Antonio’s double-digit lead through much of the second half. “I’m not happy at all,” Morant said when asked about the career-high, adding: “We came up short. So, learning from this game and prepare for the next.” While the game tipped off the Grizzlies 20th season in Memphis, things were toned down from the normal baptism of a new campaign. FedExForum was void of any fans, leaving any crowd noise to recorded reactions. “I thought our guys, our young guys competed hard, really showed themselves well for the first game we played together,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. He later added that Murray’s defense “did a good job making Morant work.” “At the end, I think we were probably a little bit tired. But Morant just took it in his own hands and decided to attack the rim. I don’t think we got back really well the last six, seven minutes of the game. But, fortunately, we were able to continue scoring.” LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for San Antonio, while Lonnie Walker IV and Keldon Johnson had 16 each, part of seven Spurs finishing in double figures. “I think we got a little sloppy toward the end,” Murray said. “But like I said, we fought, we played together, and we made it happen and we came out with a win.” Dillon Brooks scored 16 for the Grizzlies, while Jonas Valanciunas added 15 points and 13 rebounds. The Spurs, who fell behind early as Memphis was connecting on 3-pointers, clamped down on defense in the second quarter. The stingy defense and much better shooting by the Spurs helped San Antonio to a 66-53 lead at the break. “They really picked up their pressure in the second quarter, which I think really think impacted both sides of the ball,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. TIP-INS Spurs: Fourth-year G Derrick White was out recovering from left toe surgery. …Wore their City Edition jerseys with the fiesta colors – teal, pink and orange – across the chest and down the side of the shorts. … G Patty Mills connected on a 3-pointer in the second quarter, moving him ahead of Allen Iverson for 99th on the all-time made 3-pointer list with 1,060. Grizzlies: Are 9-17 in home openers, and had won six of their last eight entering the game. …Memphis remained without F Jaren Jackson Jr. (left knee meniscus surgery) and swingman Justise Winslow (left hip displacement). … Valanciunas reached 1,000 career rebounds in the third quarter. DANCIN’ POP: Spurs swingman Lonnie Walker IV apparently is trying to help coach Gregg Popovich into music, teaching the San Antonio coach about some of the better rap artist. “The only ones that I listen to are the ones you can dance to,” Popovich said. “If you can’t dance to it, then it’s not good.”","401267177"
"Karl-Anthony Towns describes the struggle he has been going through as he recovers emotionally from the death of his mother. (1:32) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Minnesota's season-opening victory over Detroit was winding down, and Karl-Anthony Towns was urged by teammate D'Angelo Russell to grab the game ball as a keepsake. For mom, in memory. Towns had 22 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, leading the Timberwolves past the Pistons 111-101 on Wednesday night after a pregame moment of silence and moving tribute video for the All-Star center's mother. Jacqueline Cruz-Towns died of complications from COVID-19 in April. “When you go through what I’ve been through, you just find a different source of strength. I don’t know how to explain it. I made a promise to these guys to be here for them,” Towns said. Malik Beasley scored 23 points, Russell pitched in 18 points, and Anthony Edwards — the first overall draft pick last month — added 15 points in his debut as the Timberwolves overcame a deficit that often reached double digits and was still 12 points midway through the third quarter. In a promising sign for this long-languishing franchise, they leaned on their defense to come back. “We grew up, man,” Towns said. Towns had to do a lot of that off the court this spring and summer, while the NBA paused for the pandemic. “You may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13th,"" Towns said. ""He’s never coming back. I don’t remember that man. I don’t know that man. You’re talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago,” Towns said. Towns, who made Minnesota’s first basket after an 0-for-7 start by the team, gave the Timberwolves their first lead of the game at 98-97 on a 3-pointer with 3:38 remaining. Russell hit one with 2:05 left for a 103-101 edge, Towns rebounded a missed deep shot on the other end by Derrick Rose, and Beasley buried one with 1:28 to go to send the Wolves on their way. Josh Jackson (19 points) and Rose (15 points) provided plenty of production off the bench, but the Pistons sputtered down the stretch and were outscored 31-16 in the fourth quarter. Rookie Killian Hayes, one of the team's three first-round draft picks, had three turnovers in the fourth quarter. “That’s what this is for, for him to learn from and get better in those situations,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Blake Griffin, the six-time All-Star, had 15 points and seven rebounds after his 2019-20 season was limited to 18 games by another left knee injury. The first overall pick in the 2009 draft, one of the few prominent players left after the overhaul commissioned by new general manager Troy Weaver, took only one shot in the fourth quarter. Jackson was the standout of a disappointing night. The rest of the Pistons shot 5 for 28 from 3-point range. “That’s part of my role on this team, to come out and spread the floor,” Jackson said. TIP-INS Pistons: Mason Plumlee pitched in 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. He went 7 for 8 from the floor. Timberwolves: Towns and Jarrett Culver (10 points, 10 rebounds) became the first Minnesota pair to record point-rebound double-doubles in a season opener since Kevin Garnett and Rasho Nesterovic in 2002.","401267178"

Jokic recorded a triple-double with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists, but he had a crucial offensive foul with 2.6 seconds left in regulation that denied Denver a chance to win it in regulation and he watched helplessly as Barnes stole the ball in the chaotic closing moments of overtime. Hield led Sacramento with 22 points and Barnes and De’Aaron Fox each added 21 for the Kings, who snapped a six-game skid in Denver, where they had last won on Jan. 3, 2017. Fox also had a key block of Will Barton’s layup with 10.6 seconds remaining in overtime and Barnes grabbed the long rebound and raced downcourt to for a layup that tied it at 122 with 6.5 seconds left. Denver called timeout, but Barnes punched the ball away from Jokic, then raced for a 4-foot dunk that Barton blocked. Hield tipped it in just before the buzzer, then raced off the court and through the tunnel at the newly renamed Ball Arena. Michael Porter Jr. scored 24 points for Denver despite early foul trouble, but playoff star Jamal Murray was held to five points and was 1-for-9 shooting before fouling out late in regulation. “I’d be lying if I told you our defense had a lot to do with that,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “When you’re as good as Jamal Murray and you have a shooting night like that, that’s more him having an off-night. Now, I give our guys credit for competing and making it hard for him. But he sees that every night. “I actually feel bad for whoever has to guard him next time out. I’m assuming he’ll probably have a pretty good game. But our guys did a heck of a job competing.” Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was asked if Murray could match his playoff prowess in the new season, and he used the opportunity to talk about how the team’s first trip to the Western Conference Finals in a decade last summer was already old news. “As great as last season was -- I’m going to keep saying this -- that season is over,” Malone said. “That was a different team. Yes, we have our core back, but we have seven new players. As great as it was to win our division, to get to the Western Conference Finals, to comeback from two 3-1 deficits; starting tonight, who cares? That’s over.” Murray emerged as a bona fide star in the bubbled playoffs in Florida, but Malone said Murray, Jokic and everyone else has to forget about that run now. “We can’t rely on that,” Malone said. “That is ancient history in my eyes. Now, Jamal has a challenge of being that player for 72 games. He did it at a high level for 19 games in the playoffs. Now, this is the beginning of the 2020-2021 season, can Jamal Murray bring it every night and help this team reach even greater heights? “Our goal has still been, we haven’t obtained our goal yet, and that is to win a championship. Jamal is going to be a big part of that.” After the game, Malone pointed to the Kings' 36-24 third quarter as the key to Denver's disappointment, and Jokic concurred, saying, “We relaxed. We played a really good first half. They came out of (halftime) really aggressive with a lot of energy and picked up the tempo of the game. We didn’t match it.” TIP-INS Kings: Corey Joseph had 12 points in 12 minutes off the bench in the first half. ... Sacramento didn't lead at all in the first half, and there was only one tie before halftime, at 7-7. Nuggets: Murray missed all five of his 3-pointers but made all seven of his free throws. ... The Nuggets were outrebounded 53-45 although no Kings reached double digits off the glass (four Sacramento players had nine boards).","401267179"
"Donovan Mitchell feeds it inside to Rudy Gobert and he throws down a dunk on Jusuf Nurkic. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 17 rebounds in a dominant season-opening performance, leading the Utah Jazz to a 120-100 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Gobert controlled the inside and got plenty of support from the outside as Utah shot 19 of 50 from the 3-point line. “It’s fun when we play the way we played tonight,” Gobert said. Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic all made four 3-pointers and Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson knocked down three apiece. Mitchell also scored 20 points. Damian Lillard was scoreless in the first half and finished with only nine points and seven assists for Portland. “They came out from the jump and they were blitzing and trapping. I wasn’t really expecting that,” Lillard said. “But I just didn’t play a good offensive game.” Utah started quickly from outside and pushed its lead to 52-33 with 6:29 left in the first half. The Jazz led by as much as 23 before taking a 64-44 lead at halftime. Lillard was held scoreless in a half for the first time in six seasons. Lillard broke the drought with a layup early in the third quarter. Perhaps no play summed up the night for Portland better than a 3-on-1 break that left Lillard wide open with 31 seconds left, before Lillard took a hesitation dribble and missed the 3-pointer with nobody around him. The frustration extended to his backcourt mate CJ McCollum, who picked up a late technical foul arguing a call in the fourth quarter. McCollum led the Blazers with 23 points. “I don’t think it was for a lack of effort. I think we played hard, we just didn’t play well on both sides of the ball,” McCollum said. Utah’s held the Blazers to barely 40% shooting and had a 59-40 rebounding advantage. It wasn’t just Gobert, but the Jazz had four other players who grabbed at least six rebounds, including Clarkson with seven boards off the bench. TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic played for the first time since March 9. He elected to have wrist surgery in May during the NBA’s hiatus and did not join the team in the NBA bubble. Bogdanovic, who averaged 20 points last season, finished with 15. Blazers: Wednesday was the first game for Portland newcomers Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. Both players are starters for the Blazers. Jones Jr. had a good night shooting the ball, hitting 3 of 5 3-pointers. Covington was 0 for 3 from the field and scoring only one point.","401267180"
"Late in the fourth quarter, Grayson Allen and Trae Young's feet get tangled up causing Young to stumble on the play. (0:25) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Trae Young scored eight straight points down the stretch and finished with 36 points as the Atlanta Hawks beat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-112 Saturday night. Kevin Huerter added 21 points for the Hawks, who won their second straight. De’Andre Hunter finished with 15 points and rookie Nathan Knight added 14 points, going 4 of 5 from the field and 2-for-3 shooting from 3-point range. Ja Morant led Memphis with 28 points and seven assists, and Kyle Anderson finished with 20 points and 14 rebounds. Dillon Brooks added 19 points before fouling out in the closing seconds. Huerter said the goal was to stop the Grizzlies’ transition game and keep them out of the paint, where they are one of the best teams in the league. “For the most part, I think we did a pretty good job at that. We tried to turn a lot of them into shooters,” Huerter said, later adding: “Trying to keep them out of the paint, and we did our thing offensively.” The game was a showdown between two of the league’s top young point guards in Young and Morant, both of whom had big season-openers. Young had 37 points in the Hawks’ 124-104 win at Chicago, while Morant scored a career-high 44 in a home loss to San Antonio. Young, who was limited to 12 points in the first half, scored 10 points in the final 2:40 against the Grizzlies, starting with the eight straight to keep Memphis from overtaking Atlanta. “I think shots just went down,” Young said of the second half. “I was getting some really good looks in that first half. Shots just weren’t going in. For all of us. … I think we got the rust off (in the first half) and played really well as far as scoring throughout the rest of the game.” The young guards carried their teams through the first half, with the Hawks also getting an early burst from Huerter, who had 13 points at the break, hitting all five of his shots. The Hawks held a 58-56 lead at the half. “We’re both young talents trying to be the face of the league,” Morant said. “We’ve played against each other many times. ... The sky’s the limit for (Young).” TIP-INS Hawks: Split a pair of preseason games against the Grizzlies in Memphis. …Starting frontline player Danilo Gallinari did not play due to a left foot contusion. … Knight, who signed a two-way contract with the Hawks after a four-year career at William &amp; Mary, scored his first NBA points in the first quarter. Grizzlies: Reserve G De’Anthony Melton was a late scratch Saturday morning due to health and safety protocols. “In terms of a return date, I’m new to this process,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, adding: “We don’t have a firm timeline yet. It’s to be determined.” ... Kyle Anderson reached 2,000 career points in the first quarter. … Morant reached 500 assists in the second quarter. INJURY KNOWLEDGE: When asked about the availability of certain Hawks injured players, coach Lloyd Pierce candidly said he can only coach the ones available. And that’s how he approaches it. “I never pretend to know about injuries,” the Hawks coach said. “I’ve never sustained an injury in my life, so I don’t pretend to know what an ACL or and MCL or anything else or foot or ankle. I don’t know anything about it, so I don’t try to pretend to know.”","401267181"
"LaMelo Ball makes two 3-pointers in the first quarter of the Hornets' game vs. the Thunder, the first of his career. (0:26) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — After watching his team surrender a 13-point lead in the final two minutes, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said he needed to clear his head. He did, and then he went to work. Gilgeous-Alexander knocked down a tiebreaking jumper with 1.4 seconds left and finished with 24 points, helping the Oklahoma City Thunder hold off a furious rally by the Charlotte Hornets to win their season opener 109-107 Saturday night. Taking the last shot is a role the third-year player said he's become comfortable with. “The greats do it,” he said. “It’s a role I'm blessed to have. But I work extremely hard and I want to take full advantage of it.” The Thunder led 102-89 with 1:50 to go, but Miles Bridges spurred Charlotte with 11 of his 14 points in the final 1:06 — including a trio of 3s in the last 25 seconds. His final 3 tied it at 107 with 10.3 seconds left. Gilgeous-Alexander then took the inbound pass, brought the ball up the floor and pulled up from 23 feet to drain a contested jumper over Caleb Martin from the top of the key. “He understood how much time he had and got to his spot,"" said Mark Daigneault, who won in his debut as Oklahoma City's coach. George Hill was 8 of 9 from the field and finished with 21 points, and Darius Bazley and Luguentz Dort each had 15 points for the Thunder after their first scheduled game against the Rockets was postponed earlier in the week. “When coach drew it up, he told Shai to go at six, I was like, he’s hitting the shot,” Bazley said. Hill said he liked what he saw from the new-look Thunder. “This season is a going to have a lot of ups and downs, some wins and losses, but the more we can stay together and be resilient, we will be fine,"" Hill said. Terry Rozier, who had 42 points on 10 3-pointers in Charlotte’s loss to the Cavaliers to open the season, had 19 points to lead the Hornets, but his desperation heave at the buzzer fell short. P.J. Washington added 18 points and rookie LaMelo Ball scored 13 points off the bench. Ball was held scoreless in the NBA regular season debut against the Cavaliers but scored nine in the first quarter Saturday, including two 3s. He later got a floater to fall from 13 feet and added a dunk off a steal, finishing the first half 5 of 6 from the floor for 13 points to give the Hornets a 59-57 lead at the break. However, he did not score in the second half, missing all four shots from the field. “I thought LaMelo played extremely well tonight,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “There may be more minutes for him. Tonight was a good step for him.” TIP-INS Thunder: Outrebound the Hornets 54-47 behind 13 boards from Al Horford. Hornets: Charlotte shot 6 of 31 from the field in the third quarter after shooting 50% in the first half. ... Bismack Biyombo started at center for Cody Zeller, who is out at least four weeks after breaking a bone in his left hand in the team's season-opening loss at Cleveland. CLOSING THE DEAL The Thunder struggled with putting the game away in the final 2 minutes, missing free throws and turning the ball over. Daigneault said that will be an area the team must improve upon. “We could have handled it better,” Daigneault said. “Hopefully we learn from it and handle it better next time.” As for his own performance in his coaching debut, Daigneault said he gave himself a “C-plus.""","401267182"
"Andre Drummond blocks the floater then corrals the ball for an outlet pass to Collin Sexton in transition who drills a 3-pointer on the other end. (0:22) DETROIT -- — The Cleveland Cavaliers took full advantage of Detroit's inability to close out games. Collin Sexton scored 32 points and three of his teammates had at least 21 points, helping Cleveland  beat Detroit  128-119 in two overtimes Saturday night. “Multiple opportunities where we could’ve given in, multiple opportunities that we could've lost the fight,"" Pacers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Every player, to a man, decided that was not going to happen. We will not quit and that’s a testament to those guys and building our identity."" While the Cavs improved to 2-0, the rebuilding Pistons dropped to 0-2 after also struggling down the stretch in their season-opening loss at Minnesota. “The positive is we put ourselves in a position to win two straight games,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. Cleveland center Andre Drummond had 23 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks against his former team. “A lot of memories just rushed into my head,"" said Drummond, who was drafted No. 9 overall by Detroit in 2012 and traded to the Cavs last season. Darius Garland added 21 points and a career-high 12 assists, setting the tone for a young backcourt with Sexton that combined to score 49 points in the season-opening win over Charlotte. “Our two young guards carried us and put us in a position to win,"" Bickerstaff said. Cleveland reserve Cedi Osman had 22 points, Kevin Love scored 15 points after missing the opener with a calf injury and JaVale McGee had 11 points off the bench. Jerami Grant had 14 of his 28 points in the third quarter, when the Pistons took control before blowing it, and Blake Griffin finished with 26 points. Detroit's Derrick Rose had 13 points, missing 11 of 15 shots, and had some costly turnovers. Cleveland led 59-53 at halftime with three scorers — Sexton, Osman and Garland — already in double figures. Griffin had 18 points at halftime, scoring all his points on 3-pointers with just two misses beyond the arc. Detroit closed the third with a 14-0 run, capped by Grant’s 3-pointer from the team’s logo at midcourt, after the Cavs led by 11 earlier in the quarter. The Pistons were ahead 101-93 with three-plus minutes left in regulation and allowed the Cavs to score the final eight points — five on Drummond's free throws — in the quarter to extend the game. Rose helped the Pistons take a nine-point lead in overtime. He later lost opportunities to seal the victory with an unforced turnover while being guarded by Drummond with 13 seconds left and by losing the ball by dribbling it off Drummond's foot to give it back to the Cavs with 1.2 seconds left. “I’ll take Derrick Rose going to the basket,"" Casey insisted.

"Russell Westbrook goes full throttle towards the basket and finishes layup in the lane. (0:16) WASHINGTON -- — The Orlando Magic beat Washington 130-120 on Saturday night, overcoming another triple-double by Russell Westbrook in his home debut for the Wizards. Westbrook had 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists to become the fourth player in NBA history to record a triple-double in his team’s first two games. Magic Johnson (twice), Jerry Lucas, and Oscar Robertson previously accomplished the feat. Westbrook is the first player to do it with a new team after being acquired from Houston in the off-season for John Wall. “This one is on me,” Westbrook said after the Wizards dropped to 0-2. “For us we didn’t put ourselves in position to win the game, especially myself. Missing easy shots — it wasn't nothing that they did.” Terrence Ross scored 25 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Markelle Fultz added 21 points to help the Magic win its second straight to start the season. “I think it was a team effort,” Fultz said about trying to contain Westbrook. “He’s a great player. He gets to the rim. He creates for others. He’s on the glass.” Bradley Beal had 39 points for the Wizards, while Thomas Bryant had 19. Westbrook, who averaged a triple-double three straight seasons from 2016-17 to 2018-19 with Oklahoma City, had just two points at the half and finished shooting 6 for 19 from the field. “I feel fine,” Westbrook said when asked how he felt physically. “I just hate losing.” Despite the triple-double from Westbrook and big night from Beal – who had 11 points in the fourth – the Magic were in control for most of the game. Washington’s final lead came at 101-100 on a dunk by Robin Lopez with 8:46 left. Orlando then used a 13-2 run in which five different players scored to go up 113-103 and seal the game. “I think they’re a bear to guard,” Clifford said about the new look Wizards. “They play at a pace that makes it difficult to stay in touch with them.” Washington has dropped five straight to Orlando. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando’s reserves outscored their Wizards counterparts 53-32. ... Clifford said pregame that James Ennis (hamstring strain) remained in Orlando to continue his rehab schedule. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said pregame that he wasn’t sure if Westbrook would play in the second half of back-to-backs but is hopeful Davis Bertans play between 18 to 20 minutes. Bertans had nine points in 20 minutes. ... HONORING WES Washington honored late Hall of Famer Wes Unseld before the game with a moment of silence and video tribute from Beal. The Wizards will wear the number 41 on their jerseys this season. Unseld died on June 20 at the age of 74.

"Ben Simmons cleans up on the offensive board with a putback dunk vs. the Knicks. (0:17) NEW YORK -- — The Philadelphia 76ers moved the ball around so well Ben Simmons felt like they were the Harlem Globetrotters. He and Embiid keep turning the New York Knicks into their Washington Generals. Embiid had 27 points and 10 rebounds while remaining unbeaten against the Knicks, leading the 76ers to a 109-89 victory Saturday night. Simmons had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists while also leading the defensive effort that forced New York's RJ Barrett into a miserable shooting performance. The Sixers beat the Knicks for the 13th straight time since early in the 2017-18 season, the first with Embiid and Simmons playing together. They did it by breaking open a close game in the third quarter, when they had seven assists on their 11 baskets. “Team basketball wins games and championships,” Simmons said. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry each scored 17 points as Philadelphia improved to 2-0 and got off to a good start in turning around its road woes after finishing with a 12-26 road record last season. Having Curry and Danny Green aboard should help with their ability to hit from deep. “If you want to double, I dare you because we’re going to knock down those shots,” Embiid said. New coach Doc Rivers earned his 945th victory, moving ahead of Bill Fitch into sole possession of 10th place on the career list. “It’s a great feeling,” said Rivers, in his 22nd season. “I don’t count and it’s not why I coach but it’s an honor.” Julius Randle scored 25 points and Alec Burks added 22 for the Knicks, who fell to 0-2 under Tom Thibodeau. Barrett, after a 26-point season opener, shot 2 for 15 and had 10 points. “Our responsibility is to improve each and every day. Come in, put everything you have into it,” Thibodeau said. “The games reveal exactly where we are and obviously it’s showing us that we have a lot of work to do.” The Knicks were without both their first-round rookies. Obi Toppin is sidelined by a strained right calf and Immanuel Quickley was still sore after sustaining a hip pointer in their season opener. The Sixers' lead was just three a minute and a half into the third quarter before six straight points made it 68-59 on Curry's 3-pointer. Randle made a free throw, but two baskets by Embiid and 3-pointers by Curry and Green made it a 16-3 run and extended the lead to 78-62 midway through the period. The Knicks cut it to nine midway through the fourth, but Embiid nailed a 3-pointer before a nice flurry by Simmons pushed it to 104-85 TIP-INS 76ers: With Philadelphia completing its first back-to-back of the season Sunday at Cleveland, Rivers wouldn't say if Embiid would be rested. ... Philadelphia's last loss to New York was April 12, 2017, long after Embiid's rookie season had ended early because of injury. Knicks: Toppin, the No. 8 pick and last season's college player of the year, had an MRI on Saturday. The Knicks said he will be re-evaluated in a week to 10 days. ... New York also remained without G Austin Rivers (groin), leaving him unable to play against his father's team. WARDROBE MALFUNCTION The Knicks debuted their City Edition jerseys and one needed a quick alteration. Reggie Bullock's jersey had his No. 25 on the front but No. 23 on the back. Mitchell Robinson is No. 23, so Bullock had to change his jersey to the correct one after it was noticed.","401267185"
"Victor Oladipo gets bumped as he's shooting a 3-pointer and still buries it. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Domantas Sobonis had 22 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Indiana Pacers used big scoring runs in the second and third quarters to cruise to a 125-106 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. T.J. Warren scored 23 points and Victor Oladipo added 22 as Indiana beat its Central Division rivals for a 10th straight time, including five straight at the United Center. Sabonis, who had a career-high 32 points in the season-opening win against New York, finished 8 for 11 from the field before fouling out with just over five minutes remaining. “My teammates really helped me,” Sabonis said. “All game long they were reminding me where to be and helping me keep my energy up. In these games, with no fans out there, that's really important.” Zach LaVine scored 17 points and Lauri Markkanen had 16 points and nine rebounds for Chicago, which dropped its second straight to start the season. After getting off to a horrid start in the season-opening loss to Atlanta, the Bulls started fairly well on Saturday, building a 40-34 advantage early in the second quarter. But the game quickly turned as Indiana ran off 21 straight points to grab a 55-40 lead. Chicago went scoreless for five minutes and fell apart at both ends. The Bulls went 0-for-8 from the field with six turnovers during the drought — with three of the turnovers coming in the backcourt against Indiana's full-court trap. Defensively, they broke down repeatedly and allowed easy baskets. “Whatever the run was in the second quarter, we have to be able to stop it sooner than that,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “They don't handle it — they don't handle it at all. They internalize it and try to do it themselves. They have to do it together. “The bottom line is this is pro basketball and you have to be able to handle it.” LaVine agreed with his coach's assessment. “We have to fight,"" he said. ""We can't let those lapses go that long.” The Pacers had a 66-56 halftime lead and started the third quarter with 18 straight points for an 84-56 edge to essentially put the game away. Chicago missed its first seven shots of the quarter and didn't score until a Markkanen layup with 7:12 left. “In the third quarter, we knew we had to come out and change things,” Sabonis said. The Bulls rallied, trimming the deficit to 114-103 with just under four minutes to play, but Warren converted a layup and Oladipo added a 3-pointer to build the lead up to 119-103. TIP-INS Pacers: C Goga Bitadze (right ankle sprain), F Brian Bowen II (right groin) and G Jeremy Lamb (left knee) each missed a second straight game.

"DeMar DeRozan gets the steal off the inbounds and throws it up to Keldon Johnson who hammers it home with two hands. (0:18) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio is emphasizing a youth movement this season. The team's veterans are still capable of pulling out a victory. DeMar DeRozan had 27 points and the Spurs rallied in the final minute to beat the Toronto Raptors 119-114 on Saturday night. San Antonio’s Dejounte Murray added 11 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double. Murray became just the 14th player in franchise history to accomplish the feat. DeRozan’s 3-pointer with a minute remaining pulled the Spurs within 114-113. The 12-year veteran was 3 for 4 on 3-pointers as he joined the list of top 100 scorers in league history. “DeMar, that’s part of his game this season, to shoot more 3s,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “He’s more confident with it and it shows.” The Spurs took a 115-114 lead on LaMarcus Aldridge’s fadeaway put-back with 29.9 seconds remaining. In his 15th season, Aldridge outfought a host of Raptors and even Murray for the rebound after San Antonio missed two previous shots. “It was impressive,” Murray said of Aldridge’s effort. Toronto’s Kyle Lowry missed a pull-up 19-footer with 22.3 seconds left, and 34-year-old Rudy Gay made two free throws at the other end. Fred VanVleet had 27 points and Chris Boucher added 22 points for the Raptors in their first road game. Toronto had six players score in double figures, including all five starters. Patty Mills added 21 points, Lonnie Walker IV had 14 and Aldridge and Keldon Johnson each had 12 for San Antonio. The Spurs had 36 assists to achieve a balanced scoring. “It was all over the place,” DeRozan said of the team’s pace. “That’s how we need to play. When we move the ball the way we did tonight, you’re going to have more outcomes like tonight.” San Antonio was playing its first home game since March 10 prior to the league imposing a four-month layoff due to the pandemic. The Spurs played a standard message outlining league rules for fans in attendance even as the AT&amp;T Center was essentially empty. There were a few family members scattered in the lower bowl, but their support was drowned out by recorded cheers. Popovich expects more 3-point shooting this season, and the Spurs responded by going 14 for 34 after attempting 25 in their season opener against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Spurs had four 3-pointers in the second quarter to match their output in the opening period, but quickening their pace enabled them to add three dunks in the second. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had 16 points and 10 rebounds for his second double-double in two games. He is averaging 17 points and 10 assists for Toronto. ... Aron Baynes made his San Antonio debut as a member of the Raptors. In his ninth season, Baynes spent his first three seasons in the NBA with the Spurs before moving on to Detroit, Boston, Phoenix and Toronto. Spurs: Popovich said Derrick White is progressing and “should return soon” after not playing in the preseason and missing the team’s opener following left toe surgery. The team’s starting point guard was running, cutting and shooting 3-pointers prior to the game with no visible signs of discomfort. ... The last two Spurs triple-doubles both came at home against the Raptors. Prior to Murray’s triple-double on Saturday, DeRozan had the team’s previous on Jan. 3, 2019.","401267187"
"Timberwolves rookie Anthony Edwards takes coast-to-coast straight at Rudy Gobert for a turn away jumper. (0:27) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Tough defense is becoming a crucial part of Minnesota’s basketball identity. That was evidenced by what the Timberwolves did in the closing seconds of their 116-111 victory over Utah on Saturday night. The Jazz had a chance to set up a tying 3-pointer and force overtime with 4.2 seconds left. Minnesota did not even let it get to that point. The Timberwolves forced Bojan Bogdanovic to commit a five-second violation on an inbounds pass. Utah got the turnover and Minnesota got the win. “We played a tough game today,” center Karl-Anthony Towns said. “We gutted this one out. Played great defense all around.” D’Angelo Russell had 25 points and six assists to lead the Timberwolves. Towns added 16 points and 12 rebounds. Minnesota had five players score in double figures. Jordan Clarkson scored 23 points and Donovan Mitchell added 21 to lead the Jazz. Mike Conley added 20 points and Rudy Gobert chipped in 18 points and 17 rebounds. Utah trailed over the final three quarters. The Jazz rallied from a double-digit deficit and closed within 107-103 with 2:27 left on back-to-back 3-pointers from Mitchell. Russell hit a jumper and Josh Okogie cut to the basket for a dunk on Minnesota’s next two possessions to keep Utah from erasing the Timberwolves’ lead. Utah made it a one-possession game on Gobert’s putback dunk with 5.9 seconds left. Russell made only 1 of 2 free throws, giving the Jazz a chance to set up a tying 3-pointer that never materialized. “They were the more aggressive team, and they took us out of our actions,” Mitchell said. “We couldn’t use their aggression against them.” Anthony Edwards tallied nine of his 18 points in the first quarter. “He’s going to continue take steps because he has a growth mindset,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “I thought he made plays within the offense too. You don’t see that a lot from a teenager.” The Jazz cut the deficit to a single possession near the midway point of the second quarter, pulling within 44-41 on a floater from Clarkson. Minnesota stamped out the rally with a 10-2 run, punctuated by a banked floater from Beasley, and extended its lead to 54-43. Utah struggled with defending the perimeter and could not adapt enough on offense to handle consistent pressure from the Timberwolves. Minnesota shot 55% from 3-point range in the first half. The Timberwolves made 11 3-pointers before halftime. On the other end, they forced 12 Jazz turnovers and turned those into 17 points. “Minnesota was the more aggressive team in the first half,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “They ran, they defended, and we didn’t do either of those things.” Not much changed for either team in the third quarter. Minnesota led by as many as 17 points in the quarter, going up 86-69 on a Naz Reid 3-pointer. TIP INS Timberwolves: Towns blocked four shots, his highest number of blocks in a game since the 2018-19 season. … Jarrett Culver went 3 of 3 from 3-point range and finished with 14 points. … Minnesota scored 26 points off 18 Utah turnovers. Jazz: Conley scored Utah’s first nine points of the third quarter. … Mitchell and Bogdanovic were a combined 9-of-39 shooting from the field. … Royce O’Neale finished with 13 rebounds. … The Jazz had a moment of silence before tipoff for Utah running back Ty Jordan, who died from an accidental gunshot wound on Friday night. BRINGING BACK THE FANS 1,500 fans piled into Vivint Smart Home Arena to watch the Jazz play their home opener. Utah is one of the few NBA teams to play games in front of fans this season. Fans were limited to seats in the lower bowl and none sat courtside near either team. The Jazz enjoyed playing before actual fans again. “It was a breath of fresh air for all of us,” Conley said. “It sounded like a lot more people than were there. Loved having the fans and our families there."" The Timberwolves also embraced seeing socially distanced faces in the crowd. “It was a dope experience,” Edwards said. GUTTING IT OUT Towns left late in the fourth quarter after falling on his left wrist. He returned to action for the final 57.7 seconds. The wrist was sore after the fall, but the Minnesota center decided to finish things out and play through the pain down the stretch. “I didn’t just want to quit the game and go get X-rays,” Towns said. “I wanted to be there in case my team needed me.” Towns fractured the same wrist in February before the NBA All-Star break.","401267188"
"James Harden sinks a filthy step-back 3-pointer to put the Rockets up 126-125, but he is outdone by CJ McCollum, who drops a game-winning 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds remaining in overtime. (1:34) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — CJ McCollum scored 44 points, including a 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds left that gave the Portland Trail Blazers a 128-126 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night. Damian Lillard had 32 points and nine assists to help Portland get its first win. McCollum also had eight assists. McCollum finished 17 for 30 from the field, including 9 for 16 on 3s. Lillard was 5 for 13 from beyond the arc. “I think besides Steph (Curry) and Klay Thompson, we’re the only backcourt in the league that empowers the other,” McCollum said of his partnership with Lillard. “I don’t try to take over the game from him. We work together.” James Harden finished with 44 points and 17 assists for Houston, and Christian Wood added 31 points and 13 rebounds. Harden also had a game-ending turnover on the final possession of overtime. Lillard’s layup pushed the Blazers ahead 125-123 with 30 seconds left in overtime, but Harden made a 3 to push the Rockets ahead with 15.3 seconds left. Then with 6.3 seconds left, the ball found McCollum again and the Blazers’ guard hit another long range shot putting Portland ahead 128-126. “We tried to do everything that it takes as a team to stop whoever has the hot hand,” Harden said of the Blazers'guards. “They both started off slow and then the rest of the game the caught fire.” McCollum’s jumper with 2:03 left in overtime pushed Portland’s lead to 123-118, forcing a Rockets timeout. After Wood cut the Blazers lead to 123-120 with a layup, Harden tied the game again at 123 with 38.6 seconds left. A layup by Wood with less than a minute left in regulation tied the score at 111. Then Lillard put the Blazers ahead at 113-111 with 52 seconds left. Harden responded with a basket of his own to tie it again at 113 with 38.9 seconds left. After a missed 3-pointer by Lillard, Houston’s PJ Tucker was called for a loose ball foul on the rebound with 32 seconds left. Houston’s challenge of the call was unsuccessful, but they were rewarded after Jusuf Nurkic missed both free-throws. Both teams exchanged empty possessions and the game went into overtime. After Portland jumped out to an early lead, Harden’s impact on the game was much more noticeable. Harden had eight assists, to go along with six points, in the first quarter alone. “I feel like my conditioning could be better obviously,” Harden said. “But I think we let it get away from us. I didn’t surprise myself at all. I know what I’m capable of.” For Portland, Lillard made good on his promise to be more aggressive after scoring only nine points in the opener, getting 21 in the first half. But despite the better start and a more aggressive Lillard, things once again went sideways for the Blazers in the second quarter. The Rockets pushed their lead to 40-30 with 8:16 left, all with Harden watching from the bench, forcing a Blazers timeout. Houston pushed its lead to 16 in the first half. Harden, who had a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists by halftime, also looked like he already had great chemistry with free agent acquisition Wood, who had 15 points in the first half, as Houston led 68-58 at the break. Houston’s grip on the game loosened in the third quarter as Portland’s defense started to string some stops together and McCollum got hot. McCollum had four 3s in the third, with three coming in a span of less than 90 seconds on his way to 14 points in the quarter. With the improved defense and McCollum’s play, the Rockets’ lead was cut to 85-84. Houston scored only 17 points in the third quarter. “We were more aggressive, we rotated a lot better,” McCollum said of Portland’s improved defense. “We’re learning, we’re learning on the fly. We have to adjust on the fly and take advantage of our time. Hopefully we will have more quarters like the third quarter tonight.” Houston has 16 players on its roster and entered Saturday with nine eligible, one more than the league minimum. The Rockets’ scheduled opener Wednesday was postponed because nine players were unavailable, including Harden after he was found to have violated league health and safety protocols. His four-day quarantine ended Friday. “It’s been difficult,’ first-year coach Stephen Silas said.” We didn’t have a shoot around on the gameday on Wednesday. “Then we didn’t play, then we didn’t have a practice that day and then we had a shootaround today. My preparation as far as film study has been fine but getting us on the same page has been a bit of a challenge.” The Rockets were still without John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon and Mason Jones on Saturday, all listed as out by the Rockets with “health and safety protocols” as the reason. Those four players, if they return negative tests, will see seven-day quarantines end Wednesday and could play as early as Houston’s home game Thursday against Sacramento. Ben McLemore and Kenyon Martin Jr. are away from the team and self-isolating, the Rockets said, and Chris Clemons is lost for the season with an Achilles injury. “We have a chance,” Harden said of the Rockets, with the hope they will have a more complete unit next week. “We just have to get things clicking faster than later. We all know the West is a very strong conference, there’s no nights off. We have to be prepared each and every game.” TIP INS Blazers: Rodney Hood scored his first points since returning from a torn Achilles he suffered over a year ago. Hood was scoreless in his first game back on Thursday, but got going with a 3-pointer in the first quarter. Hood averaged 11 points per game and shot 49% from the 3-point line in 21 games with Portland last season. Hood was also a key member of the Blazers team that went to the Western Conference Finals in 2019. Hood Rockets: With only nine active players and Harden being a late arrival to training camp, Silas was asked about what kind of workload the former MVP would have. “James will play in the 30s for sure,” Silas anticipated. “I’ll be talking to him constantly through the game. We have to look at this long-term we can’t forsake the future and having him go out play 41, 42, 43 minutes but we are going to try and win the game.” As for the four players currently in quarantine, Silas said he expects to have them back for the team’s practice scheduled for Wednesday.","401267189"
"Chris Paul nails a 3-pointer before the halftime buzzer sounds for the Suns vs. the Kings. (0:23) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — De’Aaron Fox had 24 points and seven assists, Richaun Holmes and Buddy Hield combined for five free throws in the final two minutes and the Sacramento Kings held off the Phoenix Suns 106-103 on Saturday night. Marvin Bagley III added 13 points and 11 rebounds, Harrison Barnes had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Hield finished with 14 points for Sacramento. Devin Booker scored 26 points for Phoenix. Chris Paul had 22 points and 12 assists. “We found a way to grind out a win,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “There’s lots of games throughout an NBA season that are going to require that type of mentality. Give our guys a lot of credit for the effort they played with.” Three nights after beating Denver on a last-second tip-in by Hield in overtime, the Kings had to sweat out another close one. Sacramento led 99-97 before Holmes scored on a three-point play with 1:43 remaining. Paul responded with a short jumper and free throw before Holmes made a pair from the stripe. After Booker missed a jumper with 4.7 seconds left, Hield made two free throws. Paul then made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. “I don’t know if relieved is the right word.” Barnes said. “We were just trying to maintain the edge that we had in that second half of that Denver game that really allowed us to kind of get over the hump and get that win. We were going to try to bring that into this game.” The loss ended the Suns’ nine-game winning streak dating to last season when Phoenix won its final eight games in the NBA bubble. Suns coach Monty Williams was troubled by his team’s perimeter shooting and noted that Phoenix has to regroup quickly with another game in Sacramento on Sunday. “It’s going to be a matter of will,” Williams said. “Both of us know each other. We have the fresh memory of tonight’s game. Coming out tomorrow, it’s going to be which team imposes its will on the other. We have to rise to the challenge.” The Kings got off to an 11-0 start and led most of the first half. Barnes sparked the fast start with a low bucket, a steal and a dunk. The Suns closed within 58-54 at halftime after Paul’s 3-pointer at the buzzer was waved off. The play was reviewed and overturned. TWO DOWN, 70 TO GO Sacramento is off to a 2-0 start for the first time since beating Cleveland and Philadelphia to open the 2003-04 season under then-coach Rick Adelman. The Kings last made the playoffs in 2005-06, the longest active drought in the NBA. “It’s nice but it’s mainly nice because it continues to support the journey we’re on and support the work that’s being put in by our players,” Walton said. “We’ll take it.’’ MISFIRING SUNS Phoenix shot 41.8% from the floor and was especially cold beyond the arc, going 11 of 44 on 3-pointers. Sacramento wasn’t much better at 5 for 23. “We have enough shooters to really knock those in at a higher clip,” said Jae Crowder, who had three 3s. “Looking at (the Kings) they made five 3s and beat us pretty good.” TIP-INS Suns: Booker had 11 points in the third quarter … Phoenix missed 16 of its first 3-point attempts. ... Phoenix last won 10 straight in 2010. Kings: Bagley has had a double-double in each of Sacramento’s first two games this season. The second overall pick in 2018, Bagley had only three during an injury-plagued season a year ago.","401267190"
"Luka Doncic drives down the lane and puts up the tough layup that hits the top of the backboard and falls in. (0:18) LOS ANGELES -- — Luka Doncic scored 24 points and the Dallas Mavericks led by a NBA-record 50 points at halftime in a 124-73 rout of the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday to earn their first win of the season. Josh Richardson added 21 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 18 points for the Mavs, who kept up their dominance in the second half, too. “There’s no huge secret,” Richardson said. “We just got up and played well. We played with a sense of urgency.” The Clippers trailed 77-27 at halftime, with their 50-point deficit being the largest at the break in the shot-clock era, which began in 1954-55. Paul George led the Kawhi Leonard-less Clippers with 15 points before sitting out the second half. Serge Ibaka added 13 points and nine rebounds over three quarters of the team's first loss. The Clippers began with victories over the defending NBA champion Lakers and Denver. “It's not that big of a deal,” George said. “Yes, we got our butts kicked today, but it's one game.” Los Angeles got outrebounded 32-16, had just three assists, and missed 18 of 19 3-pointers in the first half. George was the only Clipper in double figures with 13 after missing all six of his 3-point attempts. “It was a tough game, coming from Christmas. I enjoyed my Christmas Day yesterday, today just popped up on me a little too fast,” George said. “I take full responsibility. It'll be a different situation next game. We will be ready.” Doncic had 18 points, seven rebounds and four assists in the first half. He scored as many points (13) as the Clippers in the first quarter. The Mavs scored nearly every time down the court while forcing the Clippers into 9 of 37 field-goal shooting. “Everything was clicking on all cylinders,” said Hardaway Jr., adding that the team didn't realize how big the lead was until they were in the locker room at halftime. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle emphasized staying consistent in the second half. “The challenge is to maintain that level of competitiveness,” he said. “Our guys established a standard for collective toughness and will that we need to find a way to maintain.” The Clippers opened the third quarter on a 10-0 run — their biggest spurt of the game — to get within 40 points. The Mavs got right back to putting the hammer down. They connected on four consecutive 3-pointers — three by Hardaway Jr. — to restore their lead to 50. They were ahead 104-57 going into the fourth. Doncic just missed a triple-double, finishing with nine rebounds and eight assists. He has scored 83 points in his first three games of the season, the first two of which were losses. “We showed who we are. People judge us like first two games of season, it’s a long season,” Doncic said. “We got to keep going like that. We got to play defense.” The fourth quarter belonged to the teams' reserves, although the Clippers kept Luke Kennard, who started in place of Leonard, in the rotation for a bit. The Mavs' bench was on its feet and whipping towels in the air to celebrate Josh Green's one-handed fastbreak dunk that extended their lead to 53 points. Former Clipper Boban Marjanovic polished off a 12-0 run with a jumper that pushed the Mavs' lead to 120-63, their largest of the game. “We weren’t letting each other look up at the score,"" Mavs forward James Johnson said. The Mavs shot 49% from the field, made 14 3-pointers and outrebounded the Clippers 54-36 in the game. Los Angeles had 13 assists after notching 32 against Denver on Christmas. The Clippers shot 26 of 76 from the floor and made just 4 of 33 3-pointers. “You throw it away,” first-year Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Our guys didn’t have a lot of pop on either end of the floor.” Leonard sat out after needing eight stitches in his mouth after accidentally getting elbowed by the 7-foot Ibaka going for a rebound in Friday’s win at Denver. He watched the debacle from the bench. TIP-INS Mavericks: They won for the first time in three road games to start the season. Eleven of their first 16 games are being played away from home. ...

"Kyrie Irving evades the defense to score a bucket with his left hand. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Gordon Hayward gave Hornets fans a little taste of why owner Michael Jordan felt strongly about luring him to Charlotte with a four-year, $120 million contract last month. Hayward, acquired in a sign-and-trade with Boston, had 28 points, seven assists and six rebounds, and Charlotte handed the Brooklyn Nets their first loss of the season, 106-104 on Sunday night. Hayward did a little bit of everything, making 12 of 20 shots while setting up his team with good scoring opportunities and helping the Hornets out of some potentially bad possessions with solid plays before the shot clock expired. “He brings us calm and poise out there,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. “He settles us when we need a good possession, an efficient possession. He is able to create that.” The 6-foot-7 small forward said he's just starting to get comfortable with his new teammates after a limited training camp and missing two preseason games with a broken finger. “We are constantly building that chemistry,” Hayward said. “We didn’t have as much time as we wanted to get to know each other. We are starting to figure each other out. When I do, that will ultimately help me be a better playmaker.” Terry Rozier added 19 points, including two clutch free throws, and P.J. Washington finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Hornets, who limited the Nets to 42.7% shooting from the floor. Kevin Durant led the Nets with 29 points, and Kyrie Irving chipped in with 25 points. After winning their first two games by 26 and 28 points, Brooklyn as finally in a close game in the fourth quarter, which Durant said he enjoyed. He also said the Nets need to learn they'll get everyone’s best game every night because they're considered a favorite in the East. “It’s good to have that target on your backs — and it will bring out the best in all of us,” Durant said. They certainly got Charlotte’s best game. “We have to treat every team like its Brooklyn,” Hayward said. “We had this sense of urgency.” The Hornets appeared to break open the game early in the fourth quarter behind seven quick points from Hayward. But the 16-point lead nearly evaporated as Durant and Irving began to play with a sense of urgency and helped cut the lead to 101-99 with less than two minutes to play. But with a chance to tie or take the lead, Irving's driving layup was blocked and Devonte Graham knocked down a corner 3 at the other end to give Charlotte a cushion. A short while later Durant missed an open pull-up jumper with 7.4 seconds left with the Nets trailing by two. Rozier made two free throws to make it a two-possession game and seal the win. “It looked good when it was leaving my hands,"" Durant said. ""Maybe I could have shot the 3 (instead). I’m sure we will get that shot later in the season and hopefully I can capitalize.” TIP INS Nets: Spencer Dinwiddle left the game in the third quarter with a right knee strain and did not return. It's unclear if he will play Monday night. ... Brooklyn was outrebounded 54-46. Hornets: Washington appeared to roll his ankle with 5.3 seconds remaining and left the game. Borrego said the power forward sprained his ankle, but isn't sure the extent of the injury.

"Robin Lopez saves a pass from going out of bounds and throws up a wild hook shot that miraculously goes in. (0:24) WASHINGTON -- — Timing can be everything and right now the Orlando Magic have been the better team in the all important fourth quarter to start the season. Markelle Fultz and Terrence Ross each scored 26 points as the Orlando Magic mounted a big fourth quarter comeback and beat the Washington Wizards 120-113 on Sunday night to start a season 3-0 for the first time since 2009-10. Nikola Vucevic scored in the post to give Orlando the lead for good at 114-113 with 25.1 seconds left as the Magic scored the final 10 points of the game in defeating the Wizards for the sixth straight time. “We’ve played three good fourth quarters,” said Magic coach Steve Clifford. “We could easily be 0-3 right now. All three games that we’ve played, the deciding quarter’s been the fourth quarter. How you win can build confidence….I think it’s good to win this way.” Vucevic finished with 15 points and eight rebounds while Evan Fournier added 19 as the Magic outscored the Wizards 43-19 in the fourth quarter making it the third largest fourth quarter comeback in team history. Bradley Beal had 29 points and seven assists but was just 10 for 29 from the field while Russell Westbrook was held out for rest as Washington dropped to 0-3 for the first time since 2016-17. “It’s not where we wanted to be but it’s where we are,” said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. “We’ve got to get the first win first before we get anything else.” While it will become more commonplace throughout this unique season, Washington and Orlando became the first teams to play a back-to-back in the same venue since Jan. 24-25, 1988 when Washington hosted Philadelphia. “Any time you can get a win on the road, it’s big,” said Fultz, who played his high school basketball in the DC area. “To be able to go 2-0 here is a huge. I think it’s a big confidence booster for us to show us what we can do. I still think we’ve got to start out a little better.” Brooks rested Westbrook in the second game of a back-to-back.

The two-time scoring champ and nine-time all-star stood for most of the game while shouting encouragement to his new teammates and letting the referees know he was still in the building. Westbrook often greeted the players with high-fives and chest bumps during time-outs. FOOTBALL SUNDAY Vucevic was called for two fouls in the first quarter, both while guarding Bradley Beal. After the second foul, Vucevic appeared frustrated and mimicked a punting motion while holding the ball. Orlando was issued a delay of game warning.","401267193"

(0:20) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram had 28 points and 11 rebounds and the New Orleans Pelicans held on for a 98-95 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday night. The Spurs had a chance to tie after Steven Adams, whose put-back dunk had given New Orleans a 97-91 lead with two minutes left, missed a pair of free throws with 11 seconds remaining. But Eric Bledsoe blocked DeMar DeRozan's 3-point attempt from behind in the final seconds to preserve a victory that New Orleans first-year coach Stan Van Gundy found gratifying on a night when his team overcame relatively poor shooting. “As a coach, these are my favorite kinds of wins,” Van Gundy said. ""Not that I want to shoot like that every night, but to shoot 38% — and 20% from 3 — and be able to get a win against a good team, to me, is a great way to win. “The first step is we got to get to where we don’t beat ourselves, and I'm talking specifically about turnovers and fouls,"" Van Gundy added. The Pelicans had just eight turnovers to the Spurs' 15, outscored San Antonio 21-8 at the foul line and had 12 offensive rebounds to the Spurs' four. Zion Williamson had 18 points — highlighted by five dunks — to go with 11 rebounds and five steals for the Pelicans. Lonzo Ball had 16 points and five steals, and Josh Hart had 12 points and 11 rebounds off the bench.

""When one thing isn’t working for you, don’t let it affect the other parts of your game, like defense and rebounding.” Rudy Gay scored 22 points and Lonnie Walker IV had 16 for the Spurs, who lost for the first time after winning their first two regular season games. “I wish I could have knocked down a couple open 3s and kind of helped us a little bit more,” Gay said. “But the last play, obviously, they sniffed it out. We couldn’t get what we wanted out of it.” Keldon Johnson had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Dejounte Murray had 13 points, but also turned the ball over six times. New Orleans led by 15 in the third quarter when JJ Redick hit a pull-up jumper while being fouled by Gay and completed the 3-point play to make it 79-64.

Osman scored 14 points off the bench and Larry Nance Jr. had 13 points and five assists. “I still don’t think we’ve put our best four quarters together yet, but that’s our goal,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Playing agenda-less basketball, that’s what the guys have bought into.” Drummond, who has three double-doubles, netted 15 points and 10 rebounds in the first half as Cleveland carried a 64-50 advantage into the break. The Cavaliers forced 22 turnovers, six by Simmons, and turned them into 35 points. “I thought our spacing was bad,” Rivers said. “I want Ben to attack the basket, but I also want him to make plays and have a good balance. We won two games, but we just didn’t play well tonight.” Both teams completed their first back-to-back set of the season. Cleveland beat Detroit 128-119 in double overtime Saturday, while Philadelphia won 109-89 in New York. “It was a good back-to-back win because I am exhausted,” Drummond said, laughing. WAITING GAME Cavaliers G Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) has yet to dress for a game as the front office mulls whether to discipline him for an offseason arrest. The second-year pro was expected to serve as Cleveland’s sixth man. “We’re still having those conversations, still working through the plan, organizationally,” Bickerstaff said.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo tips away the pass and runs the floor for the huge one-handed dunk. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Tom Thibodeau's first victory as Knicks coach came surprisingly easy against a top opponent, as New York routed the Milwaukee Bucks 130-110 on Sunday night. Julius Randle had 29 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists, Elfrid Payton scored 27 points in his best game as a Knick, and New York led by as much as 28 against the team that had the best record in the NBA the previous two seasons. The Knicks were among the NBA's worst during that time but are hoping for a turnaround under Thibodeau, the former Coach of the Year who engineered comebacks in Chicago and Minnesota. “As long as we’re putting the work into it, we’ll get better,” Thibodeau said. The Knicks opened his tenure by hanging with Indiana and Philadelphia for a half before those teams pulled away in the final two quarters. This time, they used a 16-2 run late in the first half to open a 61-43 lead, then got 12 points apiece from Randle and Payton in the third to make it a 21-point lead heading to the fourth. The Knicks opened the final period with seven straight points for a 103-75 bulge. “We put good halves together against Indiana and last night,” Randle said. “We've just got to put the second half, full game together and that’s what we did tonight.” Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 13 rebounds for the Bucks, who were coming off a 39-point trouncing of Golden State on Christmas and looking to build momentum before playing two straight games in Miami against the team that eliminated them in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Teams are sometimes being scheduled for consecutive road games in one city this season as a way to reduce traveling during the coronavirus pandemic. But after going 20 for 37 on 3-pointers Friday, the Bucks were 7 for 38 (18%) behind the arc against the Knicks. They also allowed the Knicks to shoot 54% from the field and 59% from 3-point range. “They had a great night shooting and we've probably got be a lot better defensively,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Alec Burks scored 18 points and RJ Barrett bounced back from a poor performance against Philadelphia with 17 as the Knicks had plenty of offense even without injured rookies Obi Toppin (calf) and Immanuel Quickley (hip) for the second straight game. Frank Ntilikina had 12 points on 4-for-4 shooting from 3-point range, making New York's point guards 7 for 7 behind the arc. Payton made all three of his attempts as part of a 12-for-16 night overall. “I think we all know we have to be better,” Bucks reserve Bobby Portis said. TIP-INS Bucks: Khris Middleton scored 22 points. ... Jrue Holiday, who had 64% of his shots in his first two games with the Bucks, shot 4 for 10 for eight points. ... Portis, who played for the Knicks last season, had 17 points. Knicks: Thibodeau said G Austin Rivers, who hasn't played this season because of a sore right groin, has made progress and would go through the contact portion of practice for the first time on Monday. ... Thibodeau said he expected Quickley to be able to jump right back in when he was cleared, but thought Toppin would need more time because of the nature of his injury prevents him from doing much while he's out. PAYTON'S POINTS Payton's best game last season, his first in New York, was 20 points. He opened 2020-21 by going 3 for 13 in two games.","401267196"
"Malcolm Brogdon pokes the ball away from Marcus Smart and takes it the other way for an easy slam dunk. (0:21) INDIANAPOLIS -- — With Indiana down one in the final seconds Sunday, coach Nate Bjorkgren asked Domantis Sabontis to bail out the Pacers. The All-Star forward delivered. He put the ball on the floor, drove hard toward the basket, muscled in the go-ahead layup and drew a foul with 8.4 seconds to play. Sure he missed the free throw, but Indiana’s defense forced an errant 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left and held on for a 108-107 victory over Boston. “Coach is a genius. He has a different play for everything,” Sabonis said. “He trusts every single one of us and that makes it easier for the players. We all trust him and just try to execute as best we can.” So far, Sabonis has thrived in Bjorkgren's new system. He followed Saturday's triple-double, with 19 points, 10 rebounds and five assists — his third double-double in three games and No. 100 in his career. And Sabonis had plenty of help, too. Malcolm Brogdon scored a season-high 25 points and T.J. Warren added 17 as the Pacers improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2013-14, sweeping their first back-to-back of the season — barely. “Yes, it was designed that way,” Bjorkgren said after drawing up the play for Sabonis during Indiana's final timeout. “But I thought the other four guys really moved and shifted the defense, too, and that helped open it up for Domas.” The Celtics spent most of the second half playing catch up before finally taking a 107-106 lead when Robert Williams III stole an inbound pass and found Marcus Smart for a breakaway layup with 11.8 seconds to go. After a missed free throw Sabonis, Boston called timeout to set up a play and Jayson Tatum's long 3 was off the mark. Tatum finished with 25 points and Jaylen Brown had 18 as the Celtics lost their second straight. “We definitely beat ourselves tonight and there was still an opportunity to win the game,"" Brown said. “We gave it up at the end. We’ve got to come back and be better, be more physical and more solid on defense.” TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum also had 11 rebounds and five assists. ... Payton Pritchard added 13 points off the bench. ... Smart finished with 11 points and six assists. .... Robert Williams III had 12 points. ... Boston had 18 turnovers and got outrebounded 37-34. Pacers: Brogdon had five rebounds and five assists. ... T.J. Warren had 17 points and Doug McDermott added 16 off the bench. ... McDermott has had three straight double-figure games and went 3 of 7 on 3s. ... Myles Turner had 10 points, seven rebounds and five blocks and now has 17 blocks in three games. ... Indiana had 23 assists on 45 baskets. ... It's only the seventh time in the Pacers NBA history they've started 3-0. OLADIPO OUT The Pacers deactivated two-time All-Star guard Victor Oladipo on the second game of a back-to-back. Officially, the reason given was injury management — a reference to the ruptured quad tendon in his right knee, an injury he suffered in January 2019. Unofficially, this was something Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Prtichard wanted when he was searching for a new coach this fall. Coach Nate Bjorkgren responded by mixing and matching his rotations. HE SAID IT “I think that final play was tough,"" Brown said. “It was not all of his (Williams') fault. When Sabonis gets going with his left hand, he’s tough. He got one tonight on us.""","401267197"
"Stephen Curry dishes to James Wiseman for a powerful slam. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Although Stephen Curry is one of the best finishers in NBA history, he was more of a decoy late on Sunday night. Damion Lee hit a 3-pointer with 1.7 seconds remaining and Curry scored 36 points, sending Golden State to a 129-128 victory over the Chicago Bulls for the Warriors' first win of the season. With the Chicago defense focused on the sharp-shooting Curry, Lee inbounded the ball to Kevon Looney with 5 seconds left and then ran over to receive a handoff with Curry drawing a crowd on the left wing. Lee fired from a few feet beyond the top of the 3-point arc for the game-winner. Lee was the third option on the play behind Curry and Andrew Wiggins. “It just shows how much the coaching staff and my teammates believe in me,” Lee said. “I'm going to enjoy it. The main thing is we got the win.” Lee finished with 12 points on 4-for-5 shooting on 3s. Curry was 11 for 25 from the field, including 5 of 15 on 3-pointers — a day after making 105 straight 3s to finish practice at the Bulls’ facility. “(Lee) handled it great,” Curry said of the final play. “Him and Loon had a great connection. He was ready to shot. He made a lot of big shots tonight and that was the biggest one to keep us from an 0-3 hole.” Zach LaVine had 33 points and appeared to hit the game-winner for winless Chicago with a 10-foot pullup with 5 seconds to play. LaVine, though, thought he left too much time on the clock. “I think I shot it a little too early,” he said. “I wish I had shot the ball with two or three seconds on the clock. Even if I miss, we still have overtime.” Wendell Carter Jr. had 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Lauri Markkanen added 22 for the Bulls (0-3). Chicago committed 24 turnovers. Markkanen sat out the final few minutes with a calf contusion. With his first 3 late in the first quarter, Curry became the third NBA player to amass 2,500 career made 3-pointers. Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) are the others. Sunday's game was Curry's 702nd in the NBA. Allen played in 1,300 games and Miller 1,389. Late in the third quarter, Curry set a Warriors record for most consecutive made free throws with his 61st dating to last season. He finished 9 for 9 for the game to run his streak to 64. Rick Barry, who shot underhand from the line, held the previous record with 60 straight in 1976. Golden State led 60-56 at halftime, but Chicago started quickly in the third and grabbed an 83-73 advantage with 4 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. The Bulls led 97-93 entering the fourth. With the score tied at 100, the Bulls went on a 10-2 spurt for a 110-102 lead with under eight minutes to play. LaVine scored the final seven points, capping the run with a dunk. The Bulls maintained the multi-possession margin until Curry hit a 3 with 2:02 left to pull Golden State to 123-121. Otto Porter Jr. then made a 3 for the Bulls with 54 seconds to go, but Curry answered with a three-point play. After a miss by LaVine, Looney tied it on a putback with 16.9 seconds remaining, setting the stage for the dramatic finish. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green (right foot) missed his third straight game, but scrimmaged on Saturday and is close to returning. “Draymond got through the scrimmage really well,” coach Steve Kerr said. “We felt from a conditioning standpoint, it made sense to give him the next two games off and give him another four, five days of conditioning.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young (lower left leg infection) missed his third consecutive game. CHRISS INJURED Golden State C Marquese Chriss suffered a fibular fracture and ankle injury to his right leg during a scrimmage at practice on Saturday. He is out indefinitely and will undergo surgery later this week. The 23-year-old averaged 6.5 points and 6.5 rebounds in the Warriors' first two games. “He went up for a lob and landed awkwardly,” Kerr said. “We don’t know how long he’ll be out. We’ll know more after surgery.”","401267198"
"Buddy Hield drives to the basket and pulls up for a fadeaway bucket. (0:16) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Mikal Bridges scored 22 points, Cameron Johnson had 21 in 21 minutes and the Phoenix Suns pulled away with two big second-half runs to beat the Sacramento Kings 116-100 on Sunday night. Devin Booker added 20 points, five rebounds and five assists, and Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the Suns, a night after a 106-103 loss in the opener of the two-game set in Sacramento. That loss snapped the Suns’ winning streak at nine. Booker talked about the importance of Phoenix getting back on track. “We talked about trusting the system. We have a lot of new players out there trying to figure each other out but always with the right intention,” said Booker, a first-time All-Star a year ago. “We’re getting better. Tonight was a step forward in that on both ends. We just have to continue to grow.” Buddy Hield scored 17 points for Sacramento. First-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton added 15 points and six assists. Tied at 73 with 4:45 left in the third quarter, the Suns closed the period with a 17-5 run. Phoenix extended its lead to 107-88 on Booker’s fast-break layup during an 18-5 run in the fourth. Bridges was 9 of 15 from the field, going 4 of 8 from long range. Johnson was 7 of 9, hitting 3 of 4 3-pointers. He made all four of his free throws “When teams throw junk defenses at me and they’re blitzing a lot, we have guys that can make them pay,” Booker said. “That’s why we have the team that we do. Not surprising to me. We knew from the night before that we had a lot of open looks that we didn’t make and me myself needed to take care of the ball better. We’ll figure it out.” Kings coach Luke Walton said his team made too many mistakes. “It’s a good learning experience,” Walton said. “They’ve got guys over there, Chris Paul leading the group and an All-Star in Booker, they’ve got pride. They lost the first night, we knew it was going to be even tougher tonight. We just had some real mental breakdowns and when we did they were ready to pounce on it.” Paul had eight points and 12 assists. The Phoenix newcomer spent much of the fourth quarter cheering on his teammates while casually perched on a barrier between the bench and the court. Ayton helped the Suns to a 44-39 edge in rebounds. TIP-INS Suns: The last time Phoenix played the same team in the same city on consecutive days during the regular season was Nov. 2-3, 1990, when it opened the season with two games against the Utah Jazz in the Tokyo Dome. Kings: The Kings were attempting to go 3-0 for the first time since 2002-03. … Owner Vivek Ranadive sat near midcourt, socially distanced from five others in the organization who also watched from courtside.","401267199"
"Kyle Kuzma drives baseline and makes a fancy pass to Montrezl Harrell for an easy two-handed flush in the lane. (0:15) LOS ANGELES -- — Kyle Kuzma scored 20 points in the first half while starting in Anthony Davis' place, and LeBron James added 18 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 127-91 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. Star big men Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns sat out. Davis has a bruised calf that isn't expected to be a long-term problem, while Minnesota's Towns has a more serious dislocated left wrist. Kuzma had a phenomenal opening half in his first start since agreeing to a three-year, $40 million contract extension with the NBA champions. He hit three consecutive 3-pointers to open the scoring in a wire-to-wire win for Los Angeles, which led by 20 in the first quarter and 36 in the third. Lakers coach Frank Vogel believes Kuzma's overall game evolved last season when he moved into a supporting role with Davis' arrival. “It’s not really about scoring,” Kuzma said. “I just try to impact the game and take shots when I have them, and that’s made me a better player. ... I just try to seize the moment. In a season like this, playing back-to-backs, the coach and the organization being conservative with LeBron and AD allows me to have those nights when I can show what I work on every day.” Marc Gasol had 12 points, eight assists and seven rebounds in just 21 minutes for the Lakers, who spaced the floor and moved the ball superbly with 32 assists. “Marc sees the game very similar to how I see it,” James said. “We’ve got guys that can make the right play, make the right pass. You saw some unbelievable passes tonight from Kuz, from (Alex Caruso). The list goes on and on. Nobody should ever feel pressured to take a bad shot because we can always move the ball.” No. 1 pick Anthony Edwards had 15 points on 6-of-21 shooting in the Timberwolves' first loss of the season. Minnesota missed its first 12 3-point attempts while falling behind by 23 early in the second quarter. “I thought we didn't play our brand of basketball at all,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “There were a lot of things I didn’t like tonight, so we’ll dive into the film. We’ve got a good locker room there. We’ve got guys who want to do the right thing. They feel the same way, I’m sure.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jaden McDaniels scored his first NBA points on a pair of 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. ... Josh Okogie went to the locker room in the second quarter. The team said it was cramping. ... Towns was examined Sunday in Los Angeles. He won't require surgery, but will be evaluated weekly. Lakers: James rolled his left ankle in the first half for the second time in a week, but stayed in the game. He is questionable for Monday. ... Caruso strained a hand muscle.

"Trae Young lobs the ball to Clint Capela, who finishes the alley-oop with authority. (0:18) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 29 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic added 17 and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Detroit Pistons 128-120 in their home opener Monday night. John Collins finished with 15 points for the Hawks, who are 3-0 for the first time since 2016-17 and hit 20 3-pointers while shooting 47.6% beyond the arc. Young’s 3 from the right wing put Atlanta up 122-112 with 1:47 remaining before Jerami Grant’s 3 trimmed the lead to five with 1:05 left. Collins hit two free throws and Young sealed it with four free throws in the final minute. “Being 3-0 is great for us and for me it’s all about taking it one game at a time,"" Young said. “We're going up to Brooklyn to play a really good team and we need to bring the same energy and effort. I’m super excited about this team. Just need to get everyone healthy and it’ll be fun."" The Pistons dropped to 0-3. They were without star forward Blake Griffin and reserve guard Derrick Rose, who were given the night off to rest. Coach Dwane Casey started Josh Jackson, who scored 27 points in Griffin’s spot. Grant had 27 points, and Delon Wright chipped in 18 off the bench. “He’s shooting the ball well,"" Casey said of Jackson. “The ball seems to find him in certain situations. I love the way he's been a bright surprise for us. He’s that diamond in the rough you have to find everyone once and a while."" Wright made two free throws to pull the Pistons within five at the 3:15 mark of the third, but the Hawks went on a 29-16 run that culminated with Cam Reddish’s alley-oop dunk, Bogdanovic’s runner and Rajon Rondo’s jumper, making it 115-91 with 7:43 remaining. Detroit made another move, pulling within 115-106 on two free throws by Grant at the 4:16 mark, but Collins answered with an alley-oop dunk and Young hit two foul shots to put Atlanta up 119-108 with 2:43 to go. The Hawks made 16 of their first 25 shots before the Pistons went on a 13-2 run to pull within two in the second quarter, but Atlanta got hot again. Young scored on an acrobatic runner off the glass and converted the three-point play to make it 46-41 at the 7:04 mark of the second. Bogdanovic followed with a 3 from the right wing, De’Andre Hunter hit a 3 from the left wing, Young knocked down three free throws and Bruno Fernando hit a putback to make it 62-49. The Hawks took their first double-digit lead on Solomon Hill’s 3 at the 3:29 mark of the first. “We definitely can score,"" Hill said. “I think our offensive efficiency needs to be cleaned up.

"The Grizzlies' Ja Morant lands on a Nets player's foot after trying to block a shot and leaves the game in a wheelchair. (0:31) NEW YORK -- — Ja Morant could barely stand, needing a wheelchair to take him from the court area after spraining his left ankle. Having already lost their first two games, now the Memphis Grizzlies had lost the NBA Rookie of the Year and their best player. “A moment like that can really test you, but our guys just kept on fighting,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins. And Morant was there to watch them. The Grizzlies earned their first victory of the season, outlasting the short-handed Brooklyn Nets 116-111 in overtime Monday night. Morant was hurt late in the first half when he leaped to block a shot by Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and landed on the Nets forward's foot. Morant immediately hopped off the floor, then laid on the floor in pain before being wheeled to the back of the arena. He rejoined his teammates on the bench in the second half with his foot in a walking boot, offering energy and support to carry them through a tense finish. “He's a team player. He loves his squad,” teammate Dillon Brooks said. Morant watched Brandon Clarke score the go-ahead basket on a follow shot with 41 seconds left in overtime before the Grizzlies put it away with free throws. Morant averaged 36 points in the two losses, scoring a career-high 44 in the season opener, but the Grizzlies found enough offense without him Monday. “Unbelievable display of resiliency by our group,” Jenkins said. Kyle Anderson scored a career-high 28 points and Brooks added 24 for the Grizzlies. Clarke had 16 points and Jonas Valanciunas finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. “We kind of knew that this was a game that we had to win no matter what,” Clarke said. Caris LeVert had 28 points and 11 assists for the Nets, who rested Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving while losing for the second straight night. Brooklyn is also without Spencer Dinwiddie, who will have surgery to repair a partially torn right ACL sustained Sunday. With both stars returning this season from injury, the Nets decided Sunday night they would rest Durant after he played a season-high 36 minutes in a loss to Charlotte. They listed him on the injury report Monday morning. Irving was added a few hours later. The players forced to take on bigger roles perhaps ran out of gas in overtime, when the Nets managed five points from LeVert but nothing more, shooting 2 for 10. “Early in the season I think guys are still acclimating to back-to-backs, let alone an overtime back-to-back,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. Neither team was ahead by more than seven in the second half, when there were 16 lead changes, so it wasn’t a surprise when they needed five more minutes after LeVert missed a 3-pointer on the last possession of regulation. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis started a three-game road trip. ... Anderson's previous career high came in the last game, when he had 20 points against Atlanta. Nets: Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 21 points, but only two after halftime. ... The Nets opened a six-game homestand, their longest since playing six straight games at Barclays Center during the 2015-16 season. SPENCER'S SURGERY The Nets said Dinwiddie would have surgery scheduled for next week and further updates would be provided afterward. In an Instagram post, Dinwiddie recalled returning from a more severe knee injury in college seven months later. “Next question: Will I miss the road to a (at)brooklynnets 2021 championship? My response: As we’ve seen before. Crazier things have happened,” he wrote. BACK IN BROOKLYN The Grizzlies were the last visiting team to win in Brooklyn — nine months ago. They crushed the Nets 118-79 on March 4, a week before the season was suspended because of the coronavirus.","401267202"
"Donovan Mitchell attacks the basket and banks in a tough shot as the Jazz hang on to defeat the Thunder 110-109. (0:33) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell hit a go-ahead layup with 7 seconds left and finished with 20 points, lifting the Utah Jazz over the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-109 on Monday night. Bogan Bogdanovich scored 23 points and Mike Conley added 20 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Jazz, who ended a 17-game losing streak in regular season road games against the Thunder, including games in the NBA's Orlando bubble last season. Utah’s last win in Oklahoma City came on Oct. 31, 2010. “We tightened it up down the stretch,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “You have to get stops to win. They played hard. I don’t feel like we played our best, but that’s the challenge, to figure out how to win when you don’t have your best game. We hope we can take this and build on it and keep getting better.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who hit a game-winning shot in the Thunder’s season-opening win in Charlotte, missed a driving layup in heavy traffic at the buzzer. He had 23 points and seven assists, while Luguentz Dort led the Thunder with a career-high 26 points. “We had a shot there at the end, which is all you can ask for,” said the Thunder’s Al Horford, who scored 11 points. “There was a lot of positive. It was just too bad we couldn’t finish the game.” An 8-0 run by Oklahoma City to start the fourth quarter put the Thunder up 95-86, and they led 100-93 after a drive by Darius Bazley with 7:32 left. Utah answered with 11 straight points — the final six by Mitchell — to go ahead 102-100 with 5:10 left. Dort’s 3-pointer with 1:05 left gave Oklahoma City a 109-108 lead. Both teams traded empty possessions before Mitchell’s game-winning basket. Mitchell scored the Jazz’s final 12 points. As the game progressed, “I thought Donovan did a better of job of trying to set up and get help, using screens and pick and roll and kind of take what they give you,” Snyder said. “That’s the idea, to get better as the game goes on.” The Thunder hit their first five shots — including four 3-pointers — to go ahead 17-5 and held that lead for most of the first half, taking a 52-49 advantage into halftime. Mitchell and Bogdanovic were a combined 4 of 19 from the field in the half. After eight lead changes in the third quarter, Oklahoma City led 87-84. Utah was Oklahoma City’s scheduled opponent on March 11, when the Jazz’s Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. The game was postponed moments before tipoff and the NBA season was temporarily shut down.

""This is a growing, learning experience for all of us and we have to get better, on the defensive end especially,"" Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. ""When you have nine guys, and you are kind of doing things on the fly because you don’t have practice time, it can get ugly against a good team and that’s what happened tonight.” Harden put on a show in the second quarter, scoring 21 points and connecting on three 3-pointers, but the Rockets still trailed 70-60 at halftime. Jokic and Murray combined for 36 points in the first half to help spark the Nuggets’ offense, which had struggled during an 0-2 start. Houston pulled to 87-79 on a dunk by Jae’Sean Tate with 5:33 left in the third but the Nuggets closed the period with a 19-4 run and maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way. Paul Millsap touched off the flurry with a 3-pointer off a feed from Jokic, whose 18 assists represented a career best. “He’s a great player, a great talent,” said Millsap, who finished with 19 points. “You always know when you’re open, he’s going to hit you.” Jokic said he learned to read the floor for passing lanes early on. “I just play like that, trying to find the open guy,” he explained. “My coaches gave me the freedom to do that.” TIP-INS Rockets: On a pregame Zoom call, Silas said he was hopeful most if not all the players either quarantining or self-isolating would be able to emerge from the health protocols and rejoin the team by mid-week. “Wednesday’s practice is an important practice, getting these guys back in and getting the group on the same page,” Silas said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green, who left the Los Angeles Clippers to join the Nuggets in free agency during the offseason, remains sidelined by a left calf strain. He missed a third straight game but is getting closer to making his Denver debut, resuming practice in a limited fashion.","401267204"
"LeBron James comes up the steal and slams home a one-handed jam against the Trail Blazers. (0:20) LOS ANGELES -- — Damian Lillard scored 21 of his 31 points in the second half, and CJ McCollum had 20 points and 11 assists in the Portland Trail Blazers' 115-107 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. “Hopefully we can build on it,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said. “We realize that we can be a good team. We just beat the defending champs, and they’re a great team."" Gary Trent Jr. matched his career high with seven 3-pointers while scoring 28 points in the Blazers' second straight win over the Lakers at Staples Center. “It makes us just a little bit more confident to be coming on the road and continuing to grow, continuing to build on our effort,” Lillard said. “We’re just getting more comfortable with each other, and we’re bringing our energy.” LeBron James had 29 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the NBA champions, who finished 2-2 on their season-opening homestand. Dennis Schröder added 24 points, but the Lakers' streak of 59 straight victories when taking a lead into the fourth quarter was snapped. Trent went 10 of 14 from the field while finishing two points off his career high in an impressive response after playing less than six minutes in Portland's win over Houston last Saturday. “I would assume any young player who was coming off the kind of season he had last season would expect to be in the rotation for more than six minutes,” Lillard said. “When that happened, I was like, ‘Let’s see how he responds.’ I think it says a lot about him that he came out and had this type of performance. It speaks to how tough he is mentally and how locked in he is to this season.” Los Angeles kept it close with strong games from James and Schröder, who clearly relishes his matchups with Lillard. But their teammates largely struggled on the second night of a back-to-back. “We were kind of stuck in mud a little bit,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I don’t know (why). We just had trouble sustaining that intensity.” The Lakers made a 15-0 run early in the second half and took a one-point lead into the fourth, but Lillard and McCollum traded big shots down the stretch. Portland finished on a 12-6 surge. TIP-INS Blazers: Carmelo Anthony and Nassir Little missed the game under the NBA's health protocols. ... Zach Collins sat out with a left ankle injury. Lakers: Alex Caruso missed the game under the NBA's health protocols. ... Los Angeles got just 23 bench points, led by Montrezl Harrell's nine. AD QUIET Anthony Davis had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a tentative return from a one-game absence due to a bruised calf. He managed just two points in 17 minutes in the first half, and went 1 for 4 in the second half. “We just weren’t moving the ball that well,” Vogel said. “I’ve got to make sure I get (Davis) the ball in opportunities where he can be aggressive.”","401267205"
"Julius Randle posts a triple-double of 28 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in the Knicks second straight win. (2:13) CLEVELAND -- — Julius Randle had 28 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for his first triple-double in two years, leading the New York Knicks to a 95-86 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night. Randle, who scored 18 in the first half as New York built a 16-point lead, completed his seventh career triple-double with an assist on Elfrid Payton’s 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. It was the power forward’s first triple-double since Nov. 19, 2018, with New Orleans. “I just tried to take what the defense gave me while playing the game the right way,” Randle said. “We’ve got great spacing and when the defense collapses, I know I can make the right play. When you get wide-open shots, it makes it easier for everybody.” Reggie Bullock scored 17 points and Payton had 14 points, eight boards and seven assists for the Knicks (2-2), who won their second in a row and earned their first road victory of the season. New York made 14 of 25 3-pointers, increasing its NBA-best percentage to .459, with Randle making all four of his tries. The Knicks never allowed Cleveland to get closer than seven points in the fourth. “Julius came into camp in great shape, which is the biggest thing,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “He’s playing really well and he now knows his teammates’ strengths, which makes everyone better.” Andre Drummond notched his fourth double-double for the Cavaliers (3-1) with 18 points, 17 rebounds and a season-high six blocked shots. Cleveland started the season 3-0 for the first time since winning six in a row to begin 2016-17. The Cavaliers, who finished with the second-worst record in the NBA at 19-46 last season, missed their first 10 3-pointers and finished 7 of 32. Collin Sexton scored 20 points and Darius Garland had 17, but the starting guards were 12 of 35 from the field. “There were moments when guys tried to take it on themselves, individually,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I felt like we were desperate and tried to make the home run play, instead of just playing good defense.” Randle had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the first half, powering New York to a 53-46 advantage. Bullock made four of the Knicks’ 10 3-pointers, including a 31-footer at the buzzer in the second quarter. New York built a 29-15 lead in the first when Randle made all five of his shots in racking up 14 points, six boards and five assists. “I think we’ve got the right people in place from top to bottom in this organization now,” Randle said. “They challenged me going into the offseason and I challenged myself, as well, to come back a better player.” Larry Nance Jr. added nine points for the Cavaliers, who will be without Kevin Love (right calf strain) for at least three weeks. The five-time All-Star aggravated the lingering injury Sunday against Philadelphia. WHERE IS THE LOVE Love, who sat out the opener with the same calf strain, will not be re-evaluated until late January. He has missed 116 regular-season games since helping the Cavaliers win the 2016 NBA championship. “Predicting injuries is hard to do, but I feel bad for Kevin,” Bickerstaff said. “He’s been working his tail off, trying to get right for this season.” TIP-INS Knicks: G Alec Burks (left ankle sprain) did not play after being injured Sunday against Milwaukee. Thibodeau said Burks is day-to-day … G Dennis Smith Jr. (left quadriceps) could rejoin the team during its ongoing four-game trip. … Rookie F Obi Toppin (right calf) and G Immanuel Quickley (left hip) were inactive, along with G Austin Rivers (groin) and F Omari Spellman (right knee).

"Kelly Oubre Jr. dials in a 3-pointer for the first time this season and the Warriors' bench is beside itself. (0:26) DETROIT -- — Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Andrew Wiggins added 27 to lift the Golden State Warriors to a 116-106 victory over the winless Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night. The injury-plagued Warriors have won two in a row after dropping their first two games by a combined 65 points. The decisive stretch Tuesday came with Curry on the bench. Rookie big man James Wiseman had a dunk and Wiggins followed with a 3-pointer to cap a 12-0 run that put Golden State up 98-89 in the fourth quarter. “Just a great feeling to turn what was a mess of a road trip into a really good one,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Jerami Grant led the Pistons with 27 points. The Warriors are without stars Klay Thompson (right Achilles tendon) and Draymond Green (right foot), but now Detroit has injury problems of its own. Blake Griffin ended up in the concussion protocol and did not play in the second half, and rookie guard Killian Hayes left with a sprained right ankle. The Pistons led 89-86 in the fourth before a 3-pointer by Wiggins tied it. Wiseman's dunk came after the 7-footer blocked a shot at the other end and dribbled most of the length of the court. That put the Warriors up by six and sent several Golden State players spilling from the bench area in excitement. Curry tossed a towel in the air after Wiggins' 3 moments later. The Pistons, who led by as many as 12 points in the first half, were up 51-48 after two quarters. Golden State went on a 17-3 run early in the third, but Detroit stayed close well into the fourth. Wiggins scored 17 points in the final quarter, and three of his five 3-pointers came in the fourth. “He was phenomenal,"" Kerr said. ""He just took over the game, knocking down 3s, getting to the rim, getting to the foul line. Andrew was fantastic, just that whole fourth quarter.” Wiggins has shot better the past two games after going 10 of 34 from the field to open the season against Brooklyn and Milwaukee. “Just keep shooting, it’s going to fall,"" he said. ""You’ve just got to believe in yourself.” TIP-INS Warriors: Announced after the game they exercised the third-year contract option for next season on G Jordan Poole. ... Golden State improved to 9-22 in regular-season games without both Green and Thompson in the lineup since 2012-13. Pistons: Griffin did not play in Monday night's loss at Atlanta because of left knee issues. He finished with eight points Tuesday. Derrick Rose, who did not play either on Monday, had 15 points against the Warriors. TOUGH START The Pistons have lost all four of their games, although none by more than 10 points. “We’re playing excellent basketball through stretches, but now that next step is to continue to close the deal,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""Some good things, but again, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”","401267207"
"Malcolm Brogdon throws a slick bounce pass to a cutting Victor Oladipo, who elevates to the rim to flush a reverse dunk for the Pacers. (0:17) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens suspected history was repeating itself for the second time in three nights in his hometown. His team was “knocked all over the place” by the physical Indiana Pacers in a one-sided third quarter. But much to the satisfaction of Stevens, who played high school basketball in the Indianapolis suburb of Zionsville and coached Butler University to back-to-back NCAA championship games, his Celtics regrouped in a hurry to erase a 17-point deficit for a 116-111 road win on Tuesday. “We’re not where we want to be,” Stevens said, “but sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win. We’ve got a long way to go to get to as good as we need to be.” What changed? More defensive aggression, for starters. And Jayson Tatum stepped up with 14 of his 27 points in the final quarter, when the Celtics had a 33-18 advantage. “We knew we had to pick up the intensity,” Tatum said. “And we knew we had to get some defensive stops. We got on a roll and kept on going.” Tatum atoned for missing a 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds remaining that could have provided the Celtics with a win over the Pacers two nights ago on the same floor. In that game, the Pacers also had a huge third quarter before the Celtics rallied to take the lead. However, the Pacers won 108-107 on Domantas Sabonis’ layup with 8.4 seconds remaining. “We felt like we let the last game get away,” Jaylen Brown said. “We didn't want this one to get away, too.” Victor Oladipo, who sat out the previous game after scoring 22 points in each of his other starts, had 20 of his 24 through three quarters for the Pacers. T.J. Warren scored 15 of his 17 points in the third quarter. “Every game isn't going to be perfect,” Oladipo said. “We're still trying to figure things out. But the ceiling for this team is very scary. We can be a very good team.” The Celtics had four scorers with nine or more points for a 58-57 halftime lead. TIP-INS Celtics: Reserve guard Jeff Teague sank a 3-pointer in the second quarter to snap a streak of 15 consecutive missed shots dating back to the season opener. The Indianapolis native played one season for his hometown Pacers in 2016-17. Pacers: The last time this team started 4-0 was in 2013-14, when Indiana opened 9-0. ... Sabonis was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 1 after he averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists in three victories. THEY SAID IT “He won’t be back any time soon, certainly, you know we’re hopeful to get him back as soon as possible, but we want to make sure when we do it’s for good,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the timetable for Kemba Walker to make his season debut as he recovers from a knee injury that required a stem cell injection in October.","401267208"
"Seth Curry knocks down a 3-pointer in crunch time as the 76ers hang on to defeat the Raptors 100-93. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid had all of Philadelphia holding its breath when he grabbed the back of his right leg and needed a trip to the locker room. Coach Doc Rivers did not check on the 76ers big man because usually the health update is “bad news.” The bad news did, indeed, come — for Toronto once Embiid returned to the game. Embiid shook off the injury scare to score 29 points, grab 16 rebounds and lead Philadelphia past the winless Toronto Raptors 100-93 on Tuesday night. “He was terrific, dominant,” Rivers said. Embiid, who missed Sunday’s loss against Cleveland with back stiffness, walked gingerly to the locker room early in the third quarter with the leg injury. Team president Daryl Morey and general manager Elton Brand hopped up from their courtside seats and immediately hit the locker room to check on their All-Star center. Rivers, in his first season as coach, remained outwardly calm as he waited out Embiid. Embiid checked back into the game several minutes later with the Sixers down 11. He sank 14 of 16 free throws — as many makes as Toronto shot (12 of 14) to keep the Sixers in this one. Embiid dismissed the injury and smiled as he said “everything's fine” without elaboration. “I just did my job,” Embiid said. Tobias Harris had 26 points and 11 rebounds to help Embiid on a night the Sixers shot only 38% from the floor. Kyle Lowry scored 24 points for the Raptors. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby each had 20. “We’ve got to stretch out our good moments,” coach Nick Nurse said. “We’ve played some great moments in all the games.” Lowry, the Philly native and former Villanova standout, had said the Raptors “gotta figure this out” after an 0-2 start, and a 14-point lead in the second half should have been enough to solve their early woes. Instead, they lost the lead in one of the weirdest ways possible. Aron Baynes appeared to hit a pump-fake 3 with the shot clock about to expire for a 90-87 lead. Embiid missed a free throw when officials stopped the game and ruled the shot clock had, in fact, expired and Baynes’ points were wiped off the board. Embiid made a second free throw and the Sixers suddenly led by one. Seth Curry swished a 3 from the top of the arc that pushed the 76ers’ lead to 96-91 and helped them move to 3-1. “We didn’t play well for long stretches of the game but we stuck it out,” Curry said. Ben Simmons, who had 11 points and 13 rebounds, joked before the restart last season that he hoped boos would get piped into the bubble if the Sixers played poorly to truly reflect the Philly atmosphere. Simmons and the Sixers would have been booed off the court had fans been allowed to watch a disaster of the first half. Simmons and Embiid were awful from the floor, a combined 2 of 11 start that let Toronto grab an 11-point lead. Embiid had made all nine free throws to at least keep Philly competitive. The Sixers are loaded with one-dimensional players who struggle to get their own bucket. In year three, Simmons continues to infuriate the faithful with his massive talent overshadowed by his desire to shoot beyond 15 feet. Simmons has been floated in trade rumors — Morey has said Simmons is off the table — but another dominant shooter would surely help the 76ers. “We can't do it without our teammates,” Embiid said. “Everybody that plays, we all come in with the same purpose, we all have the same goal.” TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse said the hardest part of adjusting to life in Tampa, Florida, is finding “where the snacks are” inside the arena. But so far, so good for the Toronto-turned-Tampa Raptors. “There’s a lot of bright side,” Nurse said. “Everybody loves the weather. That seems to put a smile on everyone’s faces around the organization.” ... C Chris Boucher scored 22 points, had 10 rebounds and seven blocked shots Saturday against San Antonio. He played 5 minutes against the Sixers. 76ers: Shake Milton missed five of his six 3-point attempts. ... Curry finished with 17 points. ... The bench had just 10 points.","401267209"
"Zach LaVine gets bumped then knocks down a nice fadeaway jumper. (0:25) WASHINGTON -- — Zach LaVine scored 23 points, including nine straight in the third quarter, and Coby White added 18 to lead the Chicago Bulls to their first victory of the season, 115-107 over the winless Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. Chicago improved to 1-4 while Washington fell to 0-4, its worst start since beginning the 2012-13 season with 12 straight losses. Russell Westbrook, who sat out Sunday’s game, had his third straight triple-double with 21 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists for Washington. Bradley Beal scored 29 points and Davis Bertans added 20 for the Wizards, who shot just 10 for 37 (27%) from 3-point range. They missed 10 of 11 in the second quarter, when Chicago took the lead. “The only way we can get out of this as a team is if we stick together,” Bertans said. “Being negative about the four losses isn’t going to help us come back and win games."" Chicago players presented a game ball to coach Billy Donovan, who earned his first victory with the Bulls. He coached Oklahoma City for the previous five seasons. “I thought it was important that we showed those two guys a crowd,” Donovan said about Beal and Westbrook. “Especially Russell in transition, if he sees creases and seams he takes advantage of it.” The Bulls had seven players in double figures. Otto Porter scored 16 points, Garrett Temple and Patrick Williams had 12 apiece, and Tomas Satoransky and Wendell Carter each added 10. FAMILIAR FACES Donovan coached Beal at Florida and Westbrook with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Donovan said Beal was a pre-med major during his one year in college, and wavered before deciding to leave school after a single season. “He obviously made the right decision,” Donovan said. In his four years coaching Westbrook, Donovan said he was never disappointed. “When you have your best player when you walk in there as a coach, and you’re never worried about whether this guy is going to show up and compete, it’s an incredible luxury,” Donovan explained. Washington coach Scott Brooks preceded Donovan as coach of the Thunder, and said Westbrook is teaching important lessons with the Wizards. “We haven’t won a game,” Brooks said. “But he’s teaching these young players how important our job is and that’s priceless."" TIP-INS Bulls: F Thaddeus Young, who missed the first three games of the season with an infection of his lower left leg, said after Tuesday’s shootaround he was ready to play. But he sat out again. ... The Bulls avoided their first 0-4 start since 2007-08. … F Lauri Makkenen reinjured his left calf and played just 19 minutes. “I wanted to be available and be there for my teammates, but it’s frustrating,” he said.

"Brook Lopez heads to the line for a 4-point play after getting fouled on the triple. (0:18) MIAMI -- — On Sunday, the Milwaukee Bucks endured their worst 3-point effort in just over a year. On Tuesday, they set the NBA record for 3's in a game. Go figure. The Bucks made a record 29 3-pointers in their 144-97 romp past the reigning Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat on Tuesday night. They shot 29 for 51 from deep, two nights after going 7 for 38 in a loss to New York. “Some nights, the basketball gods are with you a little bit,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It's probably one of those nights.” Milwaukee used 13 players and 12 made at least one 3-pointer — the only exception being two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton had four 3's and scored 25 points, Jrue Holiday made six 3's in his 24-point night and Donte DiVincenzo was 5-for-6 from deep to finish with 17 points. Antetokounmpo had only nine points. But his brother, Thanasis Antetokounmpo — who was 0 for 11 from 3-point range in his career entering the night — got into the act and made one from deep. “I knew we were shooting well,” said Bucks center Brook Lopez, who made three 3's. “I didn't know we were anything close to that.” The record-breaker was made by Sam Merrill, who got the 28th 3-pointer with 6:07 remaining, giving the Bucks a 131-86 lead. The previous record for 3’s in a game was 27, set by the Houston Rockets against the Phoenix Suns on April 7, 2019. Milwaukee’s previous most was 22, against Sacramento on Nov. 4, 2018. The most previously allowed in a game by Miami was 24, on Feb. 5 against the Los Angeles Clippers. Milwaukee was up 10-0 after 78 seconds, 21-3 after about four minutes, and the tone was set in the first meeting between the teams since last season's playoffs, when the Heat eliminated the Bucks in five games. “It looked like they have been thinking about this game for 80 days,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Milwaukee led 46-26 after one quarter, 83-51 at the half. Tyler Herro scored 23 points for the Heat. Miami’s Jimmy Butler missed the game with a sprained right ankle; it's unknown if he'll play Wednesday when the Heat and Bucks meet again. “Tomorrow, we're going to have to come out with a lot more energy or we're going to get embarrassed again,” Herro said. It was the biggest road win in Bucks history, topping the 39-point margin at New York on April 10, 1987. The 47-point margin matched the second-worst loss in Heat history; they lost 138-91 to Pat Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers in the eighth game of Miami’s first season. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had 16 3’s by halftime, the most of any half in team history. ... The Bucks’ last three games have all been decided long before the final buzzer, with them beating Golden State by 39 on Christmas, then losing by 20 in New York on Sunday and leading by as many as 51 on Tuesday. Heat: The worst Heat loss was 148-80 against Cleveland in 1991. ... Tuesday's 32-point halftime deficit was second worst in team history, topped by a 33-point hole on March 8, 1989 when Riley and the Lakers led 76-43 at the break. ... Herro had 20 points by halftime, the first time he’s done that in his career. WELCOME BACK The Heat had about 100 fans at the game, all family and friends of players and employees. “I think it is a boost for the family, just to be able to have some normalcy and have a real opportunity to support their loved ones,” said Spoelstra, whose wife Nikki attended. STREAK ENDS Giannis Antetokounmpo’s streak of 108 consecutive regular-season games — and 132 overall — with at least 10 points ended. It was the first time since Feb. 13, 2017 that he played, scored less than 10 points and the Bucks won anyway.","401267211"

Orlando, 4-0 for the first time in the franchise’s 31-season history, is one of only two remaining unbeaten teams in the NBA, along with Atlanta. The Magic started 3-0 only three previous times before this season. “We’re happy where we are, to start the season 4-0, but we also at the same time are aware that there are so many things we can do better, especially on the defensive end,” Vucevic said. “The positive is knowing that we were able to win, so now we can work on those things and get better and take a step forward.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 23 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for Oklahoma City, which lost its second home game in two nights after winning its opener at Charlotte. The Thunder had won their last five games (and 15 of their last 18) against the Magic and now are 10-3 at home all-time against Orlando. Dwayne Bacon went 9 of 10 from the field and scored 18 points to go with eight rebounds for Orlando, which surpassed the 110-point mark for the fourth straight game. After the Thunder tied the score at 87-87 early in the fourth, Bacon scored six points in a 10-4 spurt that gave Orlando the lead for good. Oklahoma City made only 4 of 13 free throws in the fourth, thwarting the Thunder’s hopes to rally. Isaiah Roby, who hadn’t scored a point in a NBA game before Tuesday, had 19 points and seven rebounds for Oklahoma City, while Luguentz Dort added 15 and Mike Muscala had 14. “I thought we scrapped pretty hard tonight,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “I thought our competitiveness and engagement, in the first three quarters especially, was pretty good. There were a couple of times where the game could have gotten away from us and we made a play or made a stop. Obviously, (we) just didn’t get enough in the fourth, or throughout the game.” Orlando led 36-27 early in the second quarter before a 12-2 run — fueled by nine points from Hamidou Diallo — put the Thunder back ahead 39-38. The Magic again pushed its lead out, this time to 53-43, but Oklahoma City pulled within 60-56 by halftime. The Thunder briefly pulled even at 80-80 on a 3-pointer by Gilgeous-Alexander but Orlando led 87-85 entering the fourth quarter.

He now has 4,083 with the Magic, passing Nick Anderson (4,075) in that statistical category … Aaron Gordon started but coach Steve Clifford said Gordon remains on a minutes restriction as the player recovers from a hamstring injury he suffered last season. He scored 12 points in 22 minutes. Thunder: Center Al Horford didn’t play, resting on the second day of a back-to-back, while veteran guard George Hill missed the game with neck spasms … Roby and Justin Jackson both started for the first time this season for Oklahoma City. It was Roby’s first career start and he scored nine first-quarter points … The shooting woes continued for first-round draft pick Aleksej Pokusevski, who went 1 of 8 from the field, although he did score his first career points in the third quarter of his third NBA game. QUOTABLE: Clifford, on Vucevic setting the franchise’s record for field goals: “He’s such a professional and such a committed, conscientious player. … He gives me a lot of credit for him playing well since I got here. There’s no guy here that I’ve done less to help than him. The way he works, the amount of time he puts in, two years ago he was an All-Star and last year he was our best player. He is in a great place right now and he’s ready to have a terrific, terrific year.”","401267212"
"Devin Booker comes up with the steal and Chris Paul finishes on the other end for an easy 2. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Chris Paul played OK. Devin Booker had one of his least productive games in recent memory. The Suns' best two players didn't really do much in an intriguing matchup between two of the league's rising teams. And Phoenix still won by 25 points. Jae Crowder scored a season-high 21 points, Cameron Johnson added 18 and the Suns showed off their newfound depth by rolling to a 111-86 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. “It’s a team game, it’s not 1 v 1,"" Suns forward Mikal Bridges said. ""It’s five guys. We’re getting better every day.” The Suns broke the game open by outscoring the Pelicans 35-15 in the second quarter to take a 66-44 advantage into the break. Second-year coach Monty Williams said his team's stellar defense sparked the avalanche of points that buried New Orleans by halftime. “They missed shots tonight once we started playing with force on the defensive end,” Williams said. Phoenix turned its high-energy defense into a high-scoring offense. Even when the Suns weren't getting good looks the shots were falling. Crowder — in his first year with the Suns after helping the Heat to the NBA Finals last season — rattled home his fifth 3-pointer as the shot clock expired midway through the third quarter to push the Suns ahead 79-47. A frustrated coach Stan Van Gundy quickly called timeout for the Pelicans but the damage was already done. “The middle two quarters, I don’t even know what to tell you,” Van Gundy said. “There was nothing. Nothing good, it wasn’t one thing. We couldn’t contain them on the dribble, we couldn’t handle the ball, their pressure really got us, the pace got us. They had a much higher energy level.” Six Suns scored in double figures as they improved their record to 3-1. Deandre Ayton had 13 points and 12 rebounds, Bridges and Cameron Payne also added 13 points and Dario Saric scored 10. “If you can win a game like that and only play Booker and Chris no more than 25 minutes, it gives the other guys confidence,” Williams said. “But we know who are two best players are. There’s no mistaking that.” New Orleans fell to 2-2 this season. Zion Williamson led the Pelicans with 20 points and 9 of 13 shooting from the field. Brandon Ingram had 13 points and Steven Adams added 11. New Orleans shot just 3 of 24 from 3-point range. Phoenix made 19 3s. Johnson was credited with two points after Williamson was called for goal-tending at the third quarter buzzer, which put the Suns ahead 100-61. Both teams played mostly reserves in the fourth quarter. Phoenix earned its big halftime lead despite the backcourt of Paul and Booker combining for just seven points. Paul finished with nine points and nine assists while Booker had eight points. Crowder made all three of his 3-point attempts in the first half and led the Suns with 15 points. Bridges and Ayton both had 11. The Pelicans shot nearly 53 percent from the field in the first half but were just 1 of 11 on 3s. The Suns made nine 3s before the break. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson shot 6 of 7 from the field in the first half and had 14 points. Suns: Forward Dario Saric played in his first game this season. He missed the first three with right quad soreness. ... Rookie forward Jalen Smith missed the game because of a sprained left ankle. ... The Suns debuted their new uniforms that show ‘The Valley’ on the front and feature a bright desert sunset over a skyline on a black jersey. “I’m not going to lie, I wish we could wear these jerseys the whole season,” Ayton said.","401267213"
"Jarrett Culver spins to the basket for a layup, but Ivica Zubac meets him at the top and completely shuts down the shot attempt with a rejection. (0:16) LOS ANGELES -- — Lou Williams led seven Clippers in double figures with 20 points and Los Angeles routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-101 on Tuesday night in a game missing stars for both teams. The Clippers bounced back from a 51-point shellacking against Dallas two days earlier despite playing without Kawhi Leonard for the second straight game because of a mouth laceration. Minnesota big man Karl-Anthony Towns sat out with a dislocated left wrist. “It feels good to get a win after that atrocious loss,” said Reggie Jackson, who finished with 11 points. “We knew that wasn’t necessarily who we are.” Paul George added 18 points, Serge Ibaka had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Luke Kennard scored 15 for the Clippers. D'Angelo Russell led the Timberwolves with 22 points. Malik Beasley added 19 and Ricky Rubio had 17. Jarrett Culver equaled his career high with 10 rebounds. “We started the game the right way, but when things aren’t going our way, everybody plays selfish,"" Rubio said. ""We've got to learn.” The Timberwolves were coming off a 36-point loss to the Lakers on Sunday. “We didn’t learn nothing from the game against the Lakers,” Rubio said. “We came with the same mindset of just, go out there and hoop. That can’t continue. We are way worse than 2-2 right now.” The Clippers led by 20 at halftime and 31 in the third quarter on Williams' three-point play. That's when they made six 3-pointers, including four in a row, with George hitting two of his three in that stretch. Williams' points came off the bench to go with 12 by Ivica Zubac, helping the Clippers' backups outscore Minnesota's reserves 56-32. “Zubac was making their team kind of pay for being a smaller team,” Jackson said. “He made it easy on us.” The Wolves were quicker out of the gate, opening a nine-point lead to start the game. The teams were tied once in the second quarter, just before the Clippers' 31-11 run, including 12 in a row, that extended their lead to 70-50 at the break. “They couldn’t stop us after that,” Zubac said. “Guys were just more aggressive. Our coaching staff made a point that in the game against Dallas we had the least paint drives. Our focus was to put the ball on the floor and get into the paint.” All 12 Clippers players scored in the game. They shot 56% from the field and had a season-high 32 assists, equaling their total against Denver on Christmas. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Also missing the game were G Jaylen Nowell (left ankle) and G Josh Okogie (left hamstring strain). Clippers: Los Angeles coach Tyronn Lue said he isn't sure when Leonard will get the eight stitches out of his mouth that were needed after he accidentally got elbowed by Ibaka going for a rebound last Friday at Denver. ... The team is using prerecorded video performances of the national anthem and reruns of rap performances from previous seasons at halftime. CROATIA EARTHQUAKE Zubac grew up just east of the Croatian border and is a citizen of the country where a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck southwest of the capital of Zagreb on Tuesday. Buildings were destroyed and at least seven people were killed. “I feel like I represent the whole country, coming from a small place. People are very proud from Croatia,"" Zubac said. “It’s tough times over there. That city that was hit (Petrinja) the most was ran over during the war and the place was still in bad condition, a lot of old buildings and houses.” Zubac said he spoke to people he knows in Croatia and they weren't seriously affected by the quake.","401267214"
"Nikola Jokic scores 26 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to notch his 44th triple-double, a Denver franchise record. (1:22) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Tyrese Haliburton scored eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Sacramento Kings pulled away to beat Denver 125-115 on Tuesday, spoiling a record-setting night for Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic. The 12th pick in this year’s draft, Haliburton made several sleek plays and gave the Kings a needed lift down the stretch. Sacramento’s rookie guard hit two of his three 3-pointers in the final 9½ minutes and added a steal and fast-break layup during an 11-0 run that put the Kings ahead 120-108. “Tyrese continues to impress,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “He hit some big shots. He had some big-time playmaking for us. He was a plus-20 on the night. He’s one of those players, you feel confident when the ball’s in his hand.” Haliburton played the entire fourth quarter, when he also had five of his six assists. “I was just proud of our team being a young team playing against a team like that with experience,” Haliburton said. “We could easily have folded after a bad third quarter like that. We got a little complacent. We thought we were really going to open it up in the second half.” De’Aaron Fox had 24 points and 10 assists for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes scored 20 and Buddy Hield added 12 points and seven rebounds. Jokic had 26 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to set a Nuggets record with his 44th career triple-double. The NBA leader in assists going into the game, Jokic broke the previous mark he shared with Fat Lever while logging 38 minutes. As good as Jokic was offensively, he also was charged with 10 of Denver’s 20 turnovers. Essentially, the Denver 7-footer had a quadruple-double. “Twenty turnovers on the road for 37 points,” Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. “Nikola had 10. Unacceptable. He can’t have 10 turnovers in a game.” Jokic thought the Nuggets' offense got too stagnant. “We kind of made ourselves easy to guard,” he said. “Collectively we need to move our bodies better, then move the ball. We helped them a lot, just standing and not moving around.” Monte Morris had a career-high 24 points starting in place of Jamal Murray for Denver. Michael Porter Jr. finished with 30 points and 10 rebounds. Murray was held out of the game one day after the Nuggets guard bruised his head when he collided with Jae’Sean Tate of the Rockets in the third quarter. Murray held his hand to his head for a couple of minutes but got up and walked under his own power to the locker room for further examination. He was back on the bench midway through the fourth but did not re-enter. The Kings beat the Nuggets in Denver on Buddy Hield’s buzzer-beating tip-in in overtime in the season opener for both teams last Wednesday. QUOTABLE “I would say good teams don’t beat themselves, but that would be giving (us) a compliment we don’t deserve.” — Malone on the Nuggets. TIP-INS Nuggets: Porter had three 3s in the third quarter. … The game marked the 1,000th of Paul Millsap’s 14-year career. Millsap previously played for Utah and Atlanta. … Malone was whistled for a technical in the first quarter moments after Jokic’s dunk put Denver up 18-16. Kings: Hield has made at least one 3-pointer in 70 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA. … Harrison Barnes dished out a career-high eight assists. … The Kings were charged with a technical after Fox yelled at officials from the bench in the third quarter.","401267215"
"Jaylen Brown scores a career-high 42 points in just 29 minutes of work as the Celtics down the Grizzlies 126-107. (1:55) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown had a career-high 42 points before sitting out the fourth quarter on Wednesday night, when the Boston Celtics coasted to their 10th straight victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, 126-107. “He’s just really improved. Worked hard to improve,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the fourth-year forward, who has also been one of the leaders of the team's social justice efforts. ""Got a lot on his plate. He wants to have a lot on his plate, and that’s good.” Jayson Tatum scored 16 points and Marcus Smart had 14 before they, too, sat out the fourth quarter of the blowout. Robert Williams III had 10 rebounds for Boston, which hasn't lost to Memphis since 2016. Brown matched his career best of 34 points with three minutes left in the third. His seven 3-pointers made (on 10 attempts) tied a career high. “Since I’ve been here I’ve seen Jaylen grow every year,” forward Daniel Theis said. “He got a hot hand, hit five or six shots in a row, so we kept looking for him.” Hours after announcing they will be without leading scorer and reigning Rookie of the Year Ja Morant for three to five weeks because of a sprained ankle, the Grizzlies lost guard Grayson Allen in the first half to an ankle sprain. Jonas Valanciunas had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Memphis, and Gorgui Dieng scored 17 points. ""When we’re down players, especially when we’re down Ja, everybody has to bring their A-game or it’s not going to be good for us,"" Dieng said. “Hopefully we can hold it down until those guys get back.” Memphis opened a 4-0 lead before giving up the next 12 points of the game. The Celtics led 31-19 after one quarter and had a 17-0 run in the second — two 3-pointers from Tatum and three 3s and a putback layup from Brown — to open a 57-30 lead.

"Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant find their momentum in the second half, combing for 58 points as the Nets top the Hawks 145-141. (1:52) NEW YORK -- — In a game that was almost all about offense, Kyrie Irving just couldn't get into the act. Then in the fourth quarter, he shot the Hawks down from the unbeaten list. Irving shook off three rough quarters to score 17 of his 25 points in the fourth, Kevin Durant had 33 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and the Brooklyn Nets handed Atlanta its first loss with a 145-141 victory on Wednesday night. The opener of a two-game series was the third game in Nets franchise history where both teams had 100 points through three quarters. But Irving was just 3 for 16 from the field and getting badly outplayed by point guard counterpart Trae Young. Then he made three 3-pointers in the final period after missing all seven through three as the Nets rallied to win after dropping two straight following their 2-0 start. Irving and Durant combined for Brooklyn's final 20 points over the final 5 1/2 minutes of a game that left everyone spent. “Yeah, I definitely need a beer,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. Young had 30 points, 11 assists and six rebounds, and John Collins had 30 points and 10 rebounds. But it wasn't enough for the Hawks, who had won their first three for the first time since 2016. The Hawks were down one after Collins made two free throws with 45 seconds left, but Irving knocked down a jumper, then found Durant for a dunk that made it 141-136 with 15 seconds to go. “This is what finishing is about, execution on both sides of the basketball,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Bogdan Bogdanovic made six 3-pointers and scored 22 points and Cam Reddish had 20 for the Hawks, who led for most of the first three quarters but never by too much because the Nets — except Irving — were just as hot. Atlanta, which came into the game second in the league with 124.7 points per game, had 68 by halftime, when Irving was 1 for 10, but only led by one. “The good thing about that is even though we didn’t shoot the ball well, us two, we were still only down one point,” Durant said of he and Irving. Brooklyn put seven players in double figures, with Joe Harris adding 23 points. TIP-INS Hawks: Danilo Gallinari, who missed the last two games with a bruised left foot, came off the bench in this one but played only five minutes before leaving with a sprained right ankle. ... Pierce wasn't sure how the Hawks planned to spend New Year's Eve in New York. “We’re definitely not going anywhere. But depending on what’s allowed, we’ll have a team dinner, maybe some champagne or something in the hotel, but it won’t be anything extensive,” he said. “We’re in New York, it’s a business trip, middle of a pandemic, I think we’ll be smart and do what we continually need to do.” Nets: Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot started in place of the injured Spencer Dinwiddie and had three points. He made his first start Monday against Memphis and scored 21 points. ... Nash said F/C Nicolas Claxton, sidelined by a right knee injury, is improving, but he thought still weeks away from being ready to return. TEAMMATES TOGETHER Nash hosted Pierce on his college visit to Santa Clara, where they played together for two years and become close friends. Pierce said some of their teammates had a group text going in advance of the game and noted the slim odds of two guys from a mid-major college coaching in the NBA against each other. Nash said he was proud of all Pierce's accomplishments, praising his work on voting and civil rights initiatives in Georgia. “He’s inspired me and to get a chance to coach against him is really special,” Nash said.","401267217"

Terry Rozier, who scored 18 points, hit a pair of 3-pointers early in a 14-0 run to start the second half, giving the Hornets a 25-point lead coming off their first win — over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets — after an 0-2 start. Charlotte silenced Luka Doncic and the Mavericks, who are still without European sidekick Kristaps Porzingis as the 7-foot-3 Latvian recovers from knee surgery. Still, Dallas was coming off its first victory after dropping the first two games as well, a 51-point blowout at the Los Angeles Clippers that included an NBA-record halftime lead of 50 points (77-27). “For us it’s just about building and growing,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said. “We didn’t have the best training camp. There’s a lot of factors there, but I believe now we have found our footing.” The Hornets were up 68-57 at the break and outscored Dallas 30-12 in the third quarter. Doncic was limited to 12 points for the game and sat the fourth with the game out of reach while Tim Hardaway Jr. led Dallas with 18 points. “Their game plan was to come out as aggressively and as physically as they could and try to take any rhythm out of our game,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “They succeeded on some levels. It’s clear Luka doesn’t have his rhythm yet.” Charlotte went 5 of 10 from 3-point range in the third while the Mavericks missed their first nine after the break from long range, including three in one possession, and finished the quarter 1 of 15 from beyond the arc. Dallas was 11 of 41 for the game. Ball, the third overall pick in the draft, finished 7 of 10 from the field, including 4 of 5 from deep and made all four free throws to easily beat the high from his first three games of 13 points.

"Becky Hammon addresses what it means to become the first woman to act as head coach in the NBA, taking over when Gregg Popovich was ejected, and how the players respond to her. (0:56) SAN ANTONIO -- — Becky Hammon would have preferred a victory over history after becoming the first woman to coach an NBA team. The assistant coach took over the San Antonio Spurs in the second quarter after coach Gregg Popovich was ejected in a 121-107 loss to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. “I try not to think of the huge picture and huge aspect of it because it can be overwhelming,” Hammon said. “I really have had no time to reflect. I have not had time to look at my phone. So, I don’t know what’s going on outside the AT&amp;T Center.” Hammon and the Spurs already had a lot to contend with against the defending league champion Lakers. James celebrated his 36th birthday with 26 points, eight assists and five rebounds in the Lakers’ third double-digit victory. The teams will complete the two-game set Friday night. “(I was) trying to get the guys in the right spots,” Hammon said. “Trying to get them motivated. Obviously, it’s a learning situation for all of us, but I would have loved to have walked out there with a win with the guys.” Popovich was ejected by official Tony Brown with 3:56 remaining in the second quarter. Popovich screamed at Brown and entered the court following a non-call on DeMar DeRozan’s attempted layup and a subsequent attempted rebound by Drew Eubanks. As he exited the court to applause from several of the team’s family members in attendance, Popovich pointed a finger at Hammon and had a succinct message. “You got ‘em,” Hammon said. “See? He doesn’t treat us any differently than he does you guys.” Said LeBron James: “Obviously she’s been paying her dues over the last few years and Coach Pop has given her the opportunity. ... It’s a beautiful thing just to hear her barking out calls, barking out sets. She’s very passionate about the game. Congrats to her and congrats for our league.” Hammon took over the team’s huddles during timeouts and walked the sideline following Popovich’s ejection. Hammon was the first full-time female assistant coach in league history. “Well deserved,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I’ve talked to her before and she really knows her stuff and obviously she’s here for a reason. She’s equipped, intelligent (and the) guys have great respect for her. She’s going to be a great coach one day.” A three-time All-American at Colorado State, Hammon played for the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars in the WNBA as well as overseas before retiring to join Popovich’s staff in 2014. “Even in timeouts with Pop as head coach, she is quick on her feet,” DeRozan said. “She tells us about defensive assignments, offensive sets we should run. Seeing her in the forefront, it would have definitely been cool to have won for her.” The Lakers contributed to Popovich’s frustration and the Spurs’ fortunes didn’t get much better after the veteran coach exited. Dennis Schroder had 21 points, Anthony Davis had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Wesley Matthews was 6 for 6 on 3-pointers in scoring 18 points off the bench. The Spurs opened with a 9-2 run, including an uncontested drive through the lane by Keldon Johnson for a two-handed slam. The Lakers responded with an 11-0 run that promoted a timeout by Popovich. The Lakers took their first double-digit lead at 35-25 on Kyle Kuzma’s 3-pointer with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter. Dejounte Murray had a career-high 29 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. “At the end of the day, it don’t mean nothing, we lost,” Murray said.

It was the Clippers’ second straight blowout win to close out the year. They beat Minnesota by 23 points a night earlier after bouncing back from an ugly 51-point defeat against Dallas last weekend. Leonard wore a clear plastic mask held in place by two white straps around his head to protect his mouth, where he had eight stitches after getting elbowed by teammate Serge Ibaka a week ago. He started slowly, scoring 12 points in the first half, when the Clippers shot 58% from the floor. Leonard and George came out firing to start the second half.

"Thon Maker gets around 2 defenders and goes up and under for the layup. (0:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — All-Star center Domantas Sabonis is piling up some big numbers. Reserve forward Doug McDermott is getting on the act, too. Sabonis led the Pacers with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and McDermott provided a spark with 18 points and nine rebounds off the bench in a 119-99 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. It's the fourth time in five games that McDermott has scored in double digits. He hit three 3-pointers as the Pacers were 16 of 35 from long range. Because opponents are wary of his 3-point shooting and have adjusted defending him accordingly, that's provided more opportunities to drive to the rim. “Coming into the year, I wanted to be as aggressive as possible,” McDermott said. “I'm going to keep doing my thing and hopefully we can keep this thing rolling.” All-Star guard Victor Oladipo hit four 3-pointers. “Even though 2020 has been tough, find your triumph,” Oladipo said. “At the end of the day, we're all blessed to see 2021.” Sabonis, the 6-foot-11 center who usually does most of his work inside, made both of his 3-point tries and shot 10 of 14 overall. The NBA's first Eastern Conference Player of the Week also had 11 rebounds. Two days after blowing a 17-point, third-quarter lead in a home loss to Boston, the Pacers pulled away again after halftime to take a 20-point advantage into the fourth quarter. Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren pointed to defense. “They came out of the locker room ready to defend,” Bjorkgren said about the 31-17 third quarter. Indiana, playing seven of its first nine at home, improved to 4-1. Shooting guard Collin Sexton led the Cavaliers with 28 points, and point guard Darius Garland added 21. Cleveland was 12 of 23 on 3-pointers in the first of six straight road games. The Cavs are 3-2. Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff had an extended postgame meeting to express his displeasure in how tentative his team played at times. “Things are easy when they're good,” Bickerstaff said. “Things become more difficult when it's hard. That was the message to our guys. We have to do things decisively. You just can't be hesitant.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Sexton has scored at least 20 points in 10 consecutive games, dating to last season. Pacers: T.J. Warren missed the game with a sore foot and the Pacers announced he will have surgery to repair a small left navicular stress fracture. The team said he will be out indefinitely and updates will be provided as warranted. “They’re figuring it out,” Bjorkgren said. “T.J. wants to play so bad. He wants to be out there. That’s the kind of guy he is. That’s why I love him. ... They’re going to keep monitoring it.” ...

"Rui Hachimura overthrows his pass and it ends up stolen by Chicago as the Bulls edge the Wizards 133-130. (0:18) WASHINGTON -- — Otto Porter scored 28 points, Zach LaVine added 22 and the Chicago Bulls, playing without four players who were in the NBA health and safety protocol, beat the winless Washington Wizards 133-130 on Thursday. The Bulls played without Lauri Markkanen, their second-leading scorer and top rebounder, as well as forward Chandler Hutchison and guards Ryan Arcidiacano and Tomas Satoransky. Russell Westbrook had his fourth straight triple-double in his four games with Washington, finishing with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Thomas Bryant and Bradley Beal each had 28 points for Washington (0-5). “There’s a lot of season left,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “That first win is always going to be tough.” The Bulls, who lost their first three games and beat the Wizards twice in three days, took the lead on Coby White’s two free throws with 1:01 to play. Chicago had taken an 11-point lead in the third quarter, but couldn’t hold it. “Our defense wasn’t very good. We fouled way too much,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “Their speed and their pace is way better than ours, and we have got to change that for ourselves right now.” Chicago had seven players in double figures for the second straight game. White and Wendell Carter had 16, Daniel Gafford and Thaddeus Young added 15 and Patrick Williams had 10. “I hate that we lost the guys that we lost today,” Gafford said. “It’s a big opportunity because we had to step up, and we had to show that we were ready to play, especially in a game like this because they have two elite guards in Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. “We had to come out. We had to lock in.” Beal is upset with Washington’s start. “We don’t do moral victories,” he said. “I have to do better on the floor. I have to close the game out.” TIP-INS Bulls: Donovan said the missing players won’t be back for Friday’s game at Milwaukee. “My guess is yes, it’s going to go on here for a period of time,” he said before the game. “How long, I’m really unsure of that. I think daily testing helps bring some clarity where guys are at. I don’t know how long it will be, but I think it will be some time.” Wizards: Westbrook will sit out Friday’s game at Minnesota, the second half of a back-to-back. He also missed Sunday’s game, also the second half of a back-to-back…. F Rui Hachimura was activated after missing the season’s first four games with an eye injury. He started and played 25 minutes, scoring 17 points. “It’s been tough,” Hachimura said of being idle. “They didn’t beat us. We beat ourselves. We still have (67) games left.” NO HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE The Wizards haven’t won despite playing four of their five games at home. Brooks said that he doesn’t think there’s much of an advantage to playing at home in the fanless environment. “You get to stay home,” Brooks said. “You get to use your practice facility. At the arena, it’s all the same. What makes it challenging, you always have a boost with your home fans.” TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES Five technical fouls were assessed. Four were called against the Wizards’ Beal, Bryant, Westbrook and Davis Bertans. Gafford picked up Chicago's.","401267223"
"Ben Simmons drills a corner 3-pointer and his 76ers teammates show their excitement. (0:18) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Joel Embiid had 21 points and nine rebounds in three quarters and the Philadelphia 76ers handed the Orlando Magic their first loss with a 116-92 victory Thursday night. Off to a 4-0 start for the first time in franchise history, the Magic never had much of a shot at a fifth win because of the surprising outside shooting of the 76ers, who even got a 3-pointer from Ben Simmons. Philadelphia, which entered the game 27th in the NBA in 3-point accuracy, made eight of its first 12 attempts from beyond the arc and built a first-half lead as large as 37 points. Seth Curry added 21 points and five 3-pointers, and Tobias Harris chipped in 20 points, nine rebounds and three 3-pointers for Philadelphia (4-1), which had 38 first-quarter points and 75 by halftime. ""Tonight, we did a good job of moving that ball around and mixing it up with 3-point shots off the double teams and driving the basketball,’’ said Curry, who made seven of 12 shots and five of seven 3-point shots. The Sixers made a season-high 15 3-pointers. Simmons, who sank just the third 3-pointer of his career in the first quarter, finished with nine points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. ""We know we have a lot of potential and ways to grow, but to be 4-1 already is good,’’ Curry said. The Magic (4-1) were the NBA’s last undefeated team. Nikola Vucevic finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, while rookie guard Cole Anthony scored 16 points off the bench. ""We’re not putting enough into guarding the ball and helping. We’re not,’’ Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Things that we’ve been very good at for two years we’re not doing, and that’s the hard things.’’ Orlando was without reserve guard Terrence Ross — its leading scorer at 21 points per game — because of a right hamstring irritation. The Magic also lost starting guard Evan Fournier eight minutes into the game because of back spasms. He had three points and two assists and watched the lopsided second half from the bench. Already up 38-22 after one quarter, the Sixers made 14 of 22 shots and four of seven 3-pointers in the second period to build their lead to as large as 72-35 late in the opening half. Harris and Curry each hit three 3-pointers in the early going, while Matisse Thybulle sank two shots from beyond the arc in the first half. TIP-INS 76ers: Dwight Howard, who starred in Orlando from 2004-12, was booed when he first checked into the game and fans derisively cheered when he picked up his first foul nine seconds later. Howard drilled Philadelphia’s 14th 3-pointer of the game — and the 10th of his 17-year NBA career — in the fourth quarter. Howard had seven points and five rebounds in 14 minutes. … Thursday’s game was Philadelphia’s second of the season with fans in attendance. Sixers coach Doc Rivers said he was ""surprised’’ at the number of ""mask-less’’ citizens walking around downtown Orlando a day earlier. Asked if he felt safe, Rivers said, ""I do in the arena. You go from state to state, but you still have the same NBA protocols and that’s really important.’’ Magic: James Ennis III, who the Magic acquired last February in a trade with Philadelphia, went through drills on Thursday and Clifford said the forward is close to returning.","401267224"
"James Harden throws an alley-oop pass that Christian Wood and Danuel House throw down together. (0:25) HOUSTON -- — John Wall had 22 points and nine assists in his first game since 2018, James Harden had a big finish to score 33 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings 122-119 on Thursday night. Late in the fourth, Wall found Harden in transition for a deep 3-pointer that gave Houston a one-point lead. The two celebrated with a high-five at midcourt. “It was cool,” said Wall, who cited the 735 days since his last game in postgame interviews. “It was great to get our first win. My job is to help James as much as possible and to try and make it easier for him.” Sacramento cut Houston’s lead to 118-117 with 22.4 seconds remaining on Tyrese Haliburton’s 3-pointer, but Harden answered with two free throws. Sacramento missed two close 3s in the final seconds. Harden also had eight assists and six rebounds in the first of a two-game set with the Kings. They will meet again Saturday in Houston. “We’ve just got to keep building now,” Harden said. “It’s very difficult to beat the same team two times in a row so we know how important it is to be locked in and stay focused.” The Rockets were playing their first game with Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Eric Gordon, who missed the first two games due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Houston’s scheduled opener on Dec. 23 against Oklahoma City after COVID-19 quarantine protocols depleted the roster below the eight players required by the NBA to play a game. “We were kind of in and out of the game throughout the game,” said Rockets coach Stephen Silas, given the game ball by Wall after his first career win as head coach. “We had our highs and our lows but were keeping our composure and fighting back and dealing with adversity -- all of those things, we did tonight.” Wall, acquired from Washington for Russell Westbrook, scored his first points since Dec. 26, 2018, on a thunderous left-handed dunk in transition. Wall looked explosive on several drives to the basket and dunks in his first game back from a ruptured Achilles tendon. Cousins came off the bench and quickly drained a 3-pointer for his first basket since June 13, 2019. In 14 minutes, Cousins had eight points and three assists in his Rockets debut. Christian Wood had 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Gordon added 17 points. Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 24 points, De’Aaron Fox and Richaun Holmes each had 22, and Buddy Hield added 19. DOUBLE STUFFED Early in the third quarter, Harden threw an alley-oop in transition that appeared to be dunked through the basket simultaneously by both Wood and Danuel House Jr. The points were attributed to Wood. “He thought the points should’ve went to him,” Wood said. “If they could give them to both of us, I would’ve been happy with that, too.” TIP-INS Kings: SG DaQuan Jeffries suffered a Grade 3 left ankle sprain during 4-on-4 play Tuesday and will miss at least six weeks, the Kings said Wednesday. . PF Jabari Parker (back stiffness) remained sidelined and has yet to make his season debut. Rockets: Houston was hosting its first regular-season home game since March 10, before COVID-19 derailed last season. There were masked fans in attendance, but far below 25% capacity and only about a dozen fans sitting courtside. ...

"Brandon Ingram is ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant 2 foul while attempting a block on Isaiah Roby. (0:51) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Brandon Ingram had 20 points and seven rebounds before being ejected in the third quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-80 on Thursday night. Eric Bledsoe added 17 points and Lonzo Ball had 16 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for New Orleans, which lost all four of its games last season to the Thunder. But in their first meeting this season, the Pelicans built an 11-point halftime lead and never were seriously threatened after that. “Early in the year, we’re trying to get better,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We’ve been struggling offensively so it was good to see the ball go in the basket. It was good to score some points. I thought our defense was pretty good overall. It was just a good night and we need to keep moving forward. The games come fast and furious here.” Oklahoma City, which lost its third straight game — all at home — after winning its season opener at Charlotte, had won 10 of its 12 previous games on New Year’s Eve. Al Horford led the Thunder with 17 points and six rebounds. The Pelicans led 77-67 with 3 minutes left in the third quarter when Bledsoe’s arm caught Isaiah Roby across the face as Roby looked for a layup on a fast break. Officials ruled it a flagrant foul and ejected Ingram, but Roby missed both free throws and Oklahoma City came no closer than seven points the rest of the quarter. The Pelicans extended their lead to 85-73 entering the fourth quarter and continued pulling away, eventually leading by as many as 33 points while matching their season high in scoring. Steven Adams, in his first game against the Thunder after being traded during the offseason, had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Josh Hart added 12 points and 11 rebounds. TIP-INS: Pelicans: New Orleans posted a 58-40 rebounding advantage … Ingram entered the game averaging 10.3 points this season during the third quarter and had eight against the Thunder before his ejection … JJ Redick and Oklahoma City’s Hamidou Diallo each were slapped with a technical foul in the third quarter after jawing at each other. Thunder: George Hill returned to the starting lineup after missing Tuesday’s loss to Orlando due to neck spasms … The Thunder matched their season high with 15 3-pointers (in 48 attempts). QUOTEABLE: Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, on his team’s high volume of 3-point attempts: “(The Pelicans) are really aggressive with their on-ball defense and on help defense, and that leaves the perimeter open. I keep telling the team we’ve got to take what the defense gives us. If you have open 3s, you’ve got to take them. You’d like to have a bit more balance, and I thought there were times we tried to do too much with the ball, but overall we took good shots.” ADAMS RETURNS Adams spent seven seasons in Oklahoma City, where the New Zealand native became a fan favorite. The Thunder posted a tribute video to Adams on social media before the game and during pregame introductions, they turned up the fake crowd noise in the arena to simulate extra applause for Adams.","401267227"
"Donovan Mitchell sets up Rudy Gobert for a Jazz alley-oop vs. the Suns. (0:18) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Phoenix Suns are becoming a dangerous team on both ends of the court. The Suns beat Utah 106-95 on Thursday night for their first 4-1 start since 2009, turning up the pressure on both offense and defense. Phoenix held Utah to 41.7% shooting from the field and forced 13 turnovers. Offensively, the Suns shot a sizzling 51.5% from 3-point range and made 17 3-pointers overall. Phoenix never trailed over the final three quarters. “We played balanced the whole game,” guard Devin Booker said. Booker had 25 points and seven assists. Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder added 16 points apiece for the Suns. Phoenix had six players score in double figures. Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Mike Conley chipped in 16 points. The Jazz are 0-2 at home to start the 2020-21 season. “Teams have been coming out being aggressive and it’s taking us too long to react,” Gobert said. “We have all the weapons to counteract that, but tonight it took us too long to adjust again.” Cold shooting from the Jazz allowed the Suns to surge ahead in the second quarter. Utah missed 13 shots in the quarter and shot just 39.5% from the field overall before halftime. Phoenix used a 7-0 run capped by Chris Paul’s fadeaway jumper to seize a 30-24 lead. The Suns extended their lead to 48-33 late in the second quarter behind a flurry of baskets from Cameron Payne. “We executed, especially in the first half, defensively how we wanted to guard,” Booker said. Utah whittled a 13-point deficit down to three points early in the third quarter. Conley sparked a 16-6 run with back-to-back pullup 3-pointers. Gobert punctuated it with a running dunk that cut the Suns’ lead to 59-56. Bridges kept the Jazz at arm’s length with his outside shooting. He hit back-to-back 3-pointers to end Utah’s run and sank another two minutes later to boost Phoenix’s lead to 70-62. Phoenix scored on three straight possessions to end the quarter and kick-start a 16-2 run. Johnson made three baskets during the run, culminating in a jumper that put the Suns up 91-70 early in the fourth quarter. “That’s where we hang our hat is on the defensive end,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We feel like we’re trending in the right direction.” Utah cut a 21-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 98-93 on Conley’s 3-pointer with 2:07 left. Mitchell and Conley combined to score on five straight possessions to get the Jazz back into the game, but Utah could draw no closer. “The biggest thing is just playing through it,” Mitchell said. “Teams are going to be aggressive. We played hard but we didn’t play smart.” TIP INS Suns: Deandre Ayton finished with a team-high nine rebounds. … Paul led the Suns with eight assists. ... Phoenix scored 34 bench points over the final three quarters after the second unit went scoreless in the first quarter. Jazz: Jordan Clarkson got whistled for a technical foul in the second quarter after dribbling into a referee and shoving him following a turnover. … Bojan Bogdanovic went 0-of-5 from the field. … Utah scored 18 points off 15 turnovers. LOSING STEAM Utah has trailed over the final three quarters in both of its home losses. The Jazz have rallied from double-digit deficits in the fourth quarter on each occasion, only to fall short in the closing minutes. It’s quickly becoming a frustrating trend for Utah, which is allowing teams to take it out of its offense early. “If we are not playing to our strengths, it is going to be difficult for us,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. BRIDGES BUILDING Potent outside shooting is quickly becoming a trademark for Bridges. The third-year forward made four 3-pointers. It is the third time in five games he has made at least four 3-pointers. Bridges is averaging 15.6 points while shooting 50% from 3-point range. “He’s a guy where we value everything he does,” Williams said. “His intentions are great. It’s good to see his work paying off.”","401267228"
"Bismack Biyombo attempts an unsuccessful 3-pointer that leaves Hornets broadcaster Eric Collins in complete shock. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Dillon Brooks scored 21 points and the undermanned Memphis Grizzlies beat the Charlotte Hornets 108-93 on Friday night. Memphis, which had seven players ruled out for various health reasons and dressed just nine, closed out a three-game road trip 2-1. “Being down a few guys, it’s the next-man-up mentality,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. Kyle Anderson finished with 18 points and a career-best 11 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke 15 scored for Memphis. “Either way, I’m going to play hard off the bench or if I start,” Clarke said. “I’m able to do either one of them, and it’s fun.” Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 10 rebounds, Gogul Dieng scored 14, and Desmond Bane 10 for the Grizzlies. Tyus Jones led all players with 12 assists. “I think they’re overall aggressive and they were the aggressive team,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “In (a win on Wednesday at) Dallas, we were the aggressive team. Tonight, Memphis was the more aggressive team. Give them credit.” Bane was 2 of 7 from long distance and extended his streak of games with multiple 3-pointers to five, second-most in NBA history. Bismack Biyombo led Charlotte with 16 points and 12 rebounds, and LaMelo Ball had 15 points and a team-best six assists. The Hornets got 14 points each from Gordon Hayward and Caleb Martin. P.J. Washington finished with 10 points. “A lot of it is on the offensive end,” Borrego said of the Hornets’ struggle to score Friday. “We can’t find a rhythm offensively. We can’t get good looks or we’re turning it over. So, it’s something that we’ve got to address. There are some areas that we’ve got to refocus on and there’s not a lot of practice time here. So, we’re just going to have to do it through game reps and we’ve got another shot tomorrow night (in Philadelphia).” Charlotte was slowed by 9-of-31 shooting from 3-point range, shot just 40.7% from the floor and trailed by as many as 24 points. “That’s how you create your juice and your energy, night in and night out,” Jenkins said of the defensive effort against Charlotte, which was held to eight points in transition. “To hold a team that can score at a high level under 30 points in all four quarters. … I thought was huge.” MELO MAKING CASE FOR STARTING ROLE After a pair of impressive games, LaMelo Ball looks as if he could be a nice addition to the starting lineup for Charlotte. Coach James Borrego said he’s continuing to evaluate the team’s lineup. “I’m looking at everything right now in evaluation,” Borrego said. “We’re only five games in now. … I’ve got to continue to look and look at it hard.” Before his 15-point, six assist performance against Memphis, Ball registered 22 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in a win against Dallas. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Forward Grayson Allen, who played at Duke, missed the game with a left ankle sprain. He was one of seven Memphis players listed as out for the game. … The Grizzlies have not started the same lineup in any of their five games. … Valanciunas has posted a double-double in all five games this season. Hornets: Biyombo reached 4,000 career rebounds with seven in the first half. … Charlotte will play consecutive games in Philadelphia on Saturday and Monday to start a four-game road trip that includes stops in Atlanta and New Orleans.","401267229"

Rookie Saddiq Bey added 17 points and seven rebounds for the Pistons, who had lost four straight to start the season. Blake Griffin (concussion protocol) did not play, but Mason Plumlee filled in with 17 rebounds and eight points. “I've been a fan of Saddiq's since he was at Villanova, so I knew we had an asset when we drafted him,” Rose said. “Teams are giving him open looks and he's a shooter. When I'm on the floor with him, I'm always watching to see when I can get him the ball.” Jayson Tatum had 28 points for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown scored 25, but missed a tying 3-pointer in the final seconds. Boston didn't score in the final 4:15, missing its final 10 shots. “I thought we had a lot of open looks down the stretch, but we couldn't get anything to go down,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “But that's also a very long, hard-working, well-coached team. They aren't going to be easy to score on.” The Pistons led by as many as 21 points in the first half and had a 55-40 advantage going into the third quarter, but the Celtics' defense got them back into the game. Boston had nine points off turnovers in the quarter to cut the deficit to 79-73. “I don't know what happened at the start of the game,” Stevens said. “We just weren't running.” Bey, though, scored 12 points in the quarter to keep the Pistons ahead. “We don't know what we've got from Saddiq, because he's not a finished product, but he had another big game for us,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Brown scored the first seven points of the fourth to give Boston its first lead, and Tatum's 3-pointer made it 93-88 with 4:15 to play. The Celtics missed their next seven shots and Rose's layup put the Pistons ahead 94-93 with 1:20 left. “I was so proud of our guys because they finished that game with so much defensive energy,” Casey said. “You aren't going to shut down guys like Tatum and Brown every night, but we can make it hard for them every time.” Bey's free throw made it 95-93 with 25.5 seconds left, and Marcus Smart missed a tying shot with 5.6 seconds remaining. Plumlee missed the first of two free throws, giving the Celtics a last chance to tie the game, but Brown missed from the right wing.

ROOKIE'S IMPACT Pistons rookie Isaiah Stewart had three offensive rebounds in 18 minutes against Boston, giving him 12 in his first three games. “It's amazing what he has been able to do without playing big minutes,” Plumlee said. “He's always working to get to the glass, which is huge for us.”","401267230"
"Luka Doncic hits a crossover to get into the lane before using a Hakeem Olajuwon style ""Dream Shake"" move to make an easy lay-in. (0:30) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic had season highs of 27 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season to lead the Dallas Mavericks past the Miami Heat 93-83 on Friday night. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 18 points as the Mavericks rebounded from a 118-99 loss at home to Charlotte on Wednesday during which they trailed by 30 points in the second half. Bam Adebayo scored 19 points and Avery Bradley 15 for Miami. The Mavericks scored the final nine points of the second quarter to lead 46-31 at halftime. They padded their lead with a 10-2 run to open the third quarter and led by as many as 24 before a late Heat surge. When Doncic hit a step-back 3-pointer late in the first half, it ended a personal 12-shot drought from long range. He finished 3 for 9 behind the arc and added seven assists. The 21-year-old two-time All-Star with 29 career triple-doubles recently acknowledged he's out of shape early this season. “Luka’s going to get there,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “He’s busting his tail. He’s working hard. You saw him working out after the game (Wednesday). Everything for him now is trending in a good direction conditioning-wise.” Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler scored two points, both on free throws, and shot 0 for 6 from the floor over 27 minutes in his first appearance since playing only the first half on Christmas against New Orleans because of a sprained right ankle. Miami missed all 12 of its 3-point attempts in the first half and finished 7 for 33 behind the arc. TIP-INS Heat: Miami has used different starting lineups in all five games this season. … G Gabe Vincent, who played 15 minutes in his season debut Wednesday, was inactive with a right knee injury.

WE'RE NOT IN FLORIDA ANYMORE The Heat played their previous 35 games in the Sunshine State — 29 playoff games in the Orlando bubble, preseason games at home and in Tampa, four games this season at home and in Orlando – since playing at Washington on March 8. Because of pandemic protocols, coach Erik Spoelstra reported no highlights in coming to Dallas. “You get on a plane, you land, you take a bus, go to your hotel, order room service and that’s it,” Spoelstra said. “It’s a little bit different than our NBA experience in a typical year. That’s just the deal, and we’re grateful that we have an opportunity to continue to play.” SECOND EFFORT NEEDS WORK The Heat and Mavericks went into the game bringing up the rear in the NBA in second-chance points, averaging 7.8 and 7.5 respectively. And they couldn’t match those figures Friday. Dallas converted four offensive rebounds into seven points, Miami five offensive boards into four points.","401267231"

As does Brooklyn, which left first year coach Steve Nash lamenting both its offensive and defensive performance. “Our defense can be a lot better,” Nash said. “We have to get better offensively.” Even though Kevin Durant scored 28 points and Kyrie Irving had 18 points and 11 rebounds, the Nets have lost three of four. The Nets came back to beat the Hawks on Wednesday night in a 145-141 thriller. The Hawks ensured Brooklyn would not rally this time. Atlanta led 61-52 at halftime and extended the advantage to 89-73 at the end of the third quarter. The Hawks pushed the lead to 100-80 early in the fourth quarter. “Our attention to detail,” defensively pleased Collins. Atlanta held Brooklyn to 40.7% shooting from the field (35 for 86) and 18.9% (7 for 37) from 3-point range. “This really helps our growth to see the mistakes we made (in the last game) and play the same team, which is going to do similar things, and really learn from it,"" he said. ""I feel that was it. We locked into the small things.” That helped facilitate their offensive attack. The Hawks finished with 46.2% shooting from the field (43 for 93) and knocked down 41% of their 3s (16 for 39). “We were scrambling,” said Joe Harris, who scored 12 points for the Nets. “We know what we have to clean up.” Added Jeff Green: “We got away from our principles. ... We allowed the offense to dictate the defense.” TIP-INS Nets: Nash is concerned with his team's rebounding early in the season. The Nets are seventh in the league with 37.2 rebounds per game, but rank 13th in offensive rebounding at 10 per game. Reserve Jarrett Allen is Brooklyn's top rebounder, entering Friday with an average of 12 per game. “Gang rebounding has got to be habitual for us,” Nash said. “We’re going to struggle there until we’re really good at gang rebounding in my opinion.” Hawks: Pierce was pleased with his team's offensive efficiency despite Wednesday night's loss. “I think 92 of 99 shots last game were either in the paint or 3(s), so that’s tremendous. If we can continue to keep our turnovers low and if we can continue to play ball movement and body movement, I think we’ll stay with high-efficient shots,” Pierce said.","401267232"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets a rebound and takes it all the way down the floor, makes a move and powers home a thunderous slam. (0:24) MILWAUKEE -- — The Milwaukee Bucks believe their offseason roster overhaul made them a better 3-point shooting team. Their recent efficiency from beyond the arc bears that out. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and the Milwaukee Bucks used torrid shooting to blast the Chicago Bulls 126-96 on Friday. Milwaukee shot 22 of 45 on 3-point attempts. This came three nights after the Bucks made an NBA-record 29 3-pointers on 51 attempts in a 144-97 rout of the Miami Heat. “The guys that we have, they're ready,” Antetokounmpo said. “They're ready to shoot the ball right now. I told them to stay ready because that ball is coming.” Antetokounmpo was two assists from a second straight triple-double. The reigning two-time MVP had 26 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists Wednesday in a 119-108 loss at Miami. He only went 1 of 5 from 3-point range Friday but set up many of his teammates for open shots. “We feel like we’ve added a little more shooting depth, more guys who can make shots,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I just feel like Giannis is really doing a great job of kind of being a facilitator, a point guard, finding shooters and finding opportunities.” Three of the players the Bucks added were Jrue Holiday, Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis. That trio went a combined 9 of 14 from 3-point range Friday. Forbes had 18 points in 22 minutes and was the Bucks' second-leading scorer. “It took some time to get acclimated,” the former San Antonio Spurs guard said. “New system. New players. New coach. I think it took a lot just to kind of find my groove and where I fit in on this team. They've got confidence in me, and playing with guys like Giannis and Khris (Middleton), it makes my job easy.” The Bucks shot just 7 of 38 on 3-point attempts in a 130-110 loss at New York  on Sunday, but they’ve gone 67 of 137 in three games since. Their latest 3-point outburst helped the Bucks beat the Bulls for an 11th straight time. “We really felt like we needed to try to jam the lane up a little bit, try to keep the ball out of the paint, certainly try to take away (Antetokounmpo’s) driving angles to the rim,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “Tall order to do. We gave up a lot of 3’s because of that.” Zach LaVine scored 16 points and Denzel Valentine had 14 for the Bulls. Wendell Carter Jr. and Coby White each added 12. Middleton had 14 for the Bucks. Bobby Portis provided 13 points and 12 rebounds. Donte DiVincenzo, Pat Connaughton and Holiday added 11 points each. TIP-INS Bulls: Valentine went to the locker room midway through the fourth quarter after the right elbow of Bucks forward Thanasis Antetokounmpo hit the left side of Valentine's face as they were battling for a rebound. ... This trip to Milwaukee concluded a three-game road swing for the Bucks, who had won back-to-back games at Washington on Tuesday and Thursday. They briefly come home to face Dallas on Sunday before playing four straight road games. Bucks: The Bucks played a third straight game without reserve forward Torrey Craig, who underwent surgery Thursday after fracturing his nose Sunday in a loss to the New York Knicks. Budenholzer said he doesn’t expect Craig to be available during this five-game home stand. “I don’t know that we’ve really set a timeline,” Budenholzer said. “I think we’re just kind of seeing how he comes out of the procedure that he’s had. But my guess is it’s longer than that."" SHORT-HANDED BULLS Chicago played its second straight game without forwards Lauri Markkanen and Chandler Hutchison as well as guards Ryan Arcidiacono and Tomas Satoransky as part of the NBA’s health and safety protocols related to COVID-19. Markkanen is the Bulls’ second-leading scorer (17.3) and top rebounder (6.8). Donovan said before the game that Hutchison had tested positive and was still in Washington, where the Bulls played their last two games. Markkanen, Arcidiacono and Satoransky were back in Chicago. KEY STAT Since the start of the 2018-19 season, the Bucks have gone 28-3 against Central Division opponents. They were 13-1 against the Central last season.","401267233"
"Bradley Beal gets to the short corner and sinks a jump shot for the Wizards vs. the Timberwolves. (0:23) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Bradley Beal had 31 points and seven assists, and the Washington Wizards beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 130-109 on Friday night without Russell Westbrook for their first win of the season. Westbrook sat out for rest on the second game of a back-to-back, but the Wizards (1-5) looked like a much better team than the one that lost the night before to Chicago at home. Washington jumped to an early lead and answered every Minnesota challenge. “The energy's totally different; it's just positive,” Beal said of earning the team's first victory. “It's uplifting. It's like a weight off your shoulders in a way, but it's even better to know we played the right way and played the way we know we're capable of playing.” With Beal leading the way, the Wizards finished the third quarter on a 29-7 surge and scored 40 points in the period for a 100-79 lead. Beal had 14 in the quarter. Malik Beasley scored 21 to lead the Timberwolves (2-3), who have lost three in a row with star center Karl-Anthony Towns missing all three games because of a dislocated left wrist. D’Angelo Russell had 14 points for Minnesota. “Our energy was low,” Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said about the third quarter. “They were desperate tonight and we should have been that team, too, after our LA trip. We were not and it was evident in that third quarter."" Thomas Bryant added 18 points and seven rebounds for Washington, which had eight players score in double figures and shot a season-high 55.1% from the field. Westbrook missed his second game of the season, but Beal has grown accustomed to playing without a star backcourt mate. John Wall missed last season and played only 73 games over the past three seasons while Beal developed as one of the NBA's top scorers. Beal scored 14 points in the first quarter as the Wizards led by as many as 12 and went without a turnover. He didn’t play in the fourth. “We can have seven, eight straight losses and we still believe in ourselves,” rookie Deni Avdija said. ""Mark my words — we’re gonna be good.” Russell, the Wolves’ sidekick for Towns, couldn’t pick up the slack without him. He shot 6 of 16 from the field and had five turnovers. Without their main man in the middle, Minnesota allowed more than 120 points for the third straight game. “We don't feel like you have to add to your load just because a guy like Karl is out,” Saunders said. “It's on all of us. We need more offensively, more defensively. That's not just from an individual player, that's from a collective group. With that, individually, we need more from guys to get out of this rut."" TIP-INS Wizards: Raul Neto made his second start this season in place of Westbrook and had 12 points, including a pair of 3-pointers. … Beal has scored at least 20 points in 29 straight games, the longest current streak in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard started the day second on the list with 14 in a row. Beal is the first player in team history to score at least 25 points in the first six games of a season. … Davis Bertans was 3 of 7 from 3-point territory a day after going 0 of 8. Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without forward Josh Okogie, who missed his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. … No. 1 overall draft pick Anthony Edwards had 17 points. Naz Reid scored 17 starting in place of Towns. LEARNING ON THE FLY Avidja, the No. 9 overall draft pick, had a season-high 11 points and added seven rebounds, three assists and three steals. His best game of the season earned accolades from coach Scott Brooks. “I thought Deni took another step in a young career,” Brooks said. “I thought he was able to make a few plays that we can maybe utilize him more in the future.”","401267234"
"LeBron James goes for 26 points while Anthony Davis puts up 34 in the Lakers' 109-103 win over the Spurs. (2:28) SAN ANTONIO -- — The Los Angeles Lakers know they are not always going to feel or play like the defending league champions. Anthony Davis had 35 points and 11 rebounds and LeBron James added 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists as the Lakers rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-103 on Friday night. The Lakers closed the game with a 9-0 run for their second win against the Spurs in three days. “We persisted through our struggles,” Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. “That’s going to happen from time to time. In a 72-game season, you are going to have some wins that are uglier than others. We knew coming into this season, with the quick turnaround, there was going to be some ugly nights. The key is to find a way to win when you are not at your best.” The Lakers found a way to win by attacking the paint late against the youthful core of the Spurs. San Antonio forward Keldon Johnson blocked James’ layup attempt, but Kyle Kuzma tipped in the follow to give the Lakers a 105-103 lead with 53.9 seconds remaining. James followed with a layup and Davis closed the scoring with two free throws. “Their game plan tweaked,” Kuzma said. “They added a little bit of a different element for us. We had to adjust down the stretch.” Johnson had a career-high 26 points and added 10 rebounds for his fourth game of 20-plus points in two seasons. Only Hall of Famer Tim Duncan had more 20-point efforts through his first 25 career games with the Spurs, getting six during his rookie season. “He’s a competitor,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said of Johnson. “He’s a fine young player and he’s going to have a great career. That’s about all I can say. He’s been wonderful.” Johnson was 5 for 9 on 3-pointers, including a 26-footer with 6:30 remaining that put the Spurs up 95-94. Unlike in Wednesday’s 121-107 loss, the Spurs were able to keep pace with the Lakers early. “We played a heck of a basketball team, and we were a good basketball team tonight also,” Popovich said. “So, I was happy with their play.” The Lakers picked up their pace to start the second half, resulting in a 10-2 advantage in fast-break points and a 64-57 lead a minute into the third quarter. Los Angeles closed the game with a 12-9 advantage on fast-break points. Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope exited in the second half after mildly spraining his left ankle when he stepped awkwardly driving for a layup. Caldwell-Pope remained down for about a minute before being assisted off the court. He had 11 points before exiting with 8:31 left in the third quarter. DeMar DeRozan had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for San Antonio, which has lost three straight after opening the season with two victories. Spurs guard Derrick White had nine points in 23 minutes in his season debut after undergoing toe surgery in the offseason. TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers entered the game shooting 42 percent on 3-pointers, which is second in the league. They were 14 for 33 on Friday. … Wesley Matthews was scoreless, going 0 for 2 on 3-pointers after going 6 for 6 on 3s and scoring 18 points in Wednesday’s victory over the Spurs. … James fell to the court after taking an elbow from Drew Eubanks early in the fourth. James continually grabbed his side for a few possessions after but appeared fine afterwards. Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge missed his second straight game with an undisclosed illness as well as a sore left knee. ...

"Jamal Murray drains the 26-foot step-back jumper right over DeAndre Ayton late in the third quarter. (0:16) DENVER -- — Chris Paul presented a convincing argument in persuading his coach to challenge a late call. There was no argument necessary to convince anyone who should take a clutch shot in the closing seconds. Paul came through yet again. The point guard hit a big jumper with 7.3 seconds remaining after a successful coach's challenge on the other end and the Phoenix Suns moved to an NBA-best 5-1 by holding off the scuffling Denver Nuggets 106-103 on Friday night. They were last 5-1 in 2009-10. Moments like this are precisely why the Suns acquired Paul in a deal with Oklahoma City. Paul led the NBA in clutch scoring last season. “Him being able to knock down shots, and the ability and will to take those shots, is huge for us,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. His lobbying skills proved just as powerful. With Phoenix leading 102-100 with around 30 seconds remaining, Mikal Bridges was called for a foul that would've sent Gary Harris to the line. But on the advice of Paul, Williams decided to challenge the play. Replays appeared to show Bridges sliding underneath Harris near the basket — and with no contact — as Harris lost the ball. “Usually, fouls aren’t overturned,” Williams explained. “But he’s like, ‘Coach, why not?’ ... That's how it happened. He’s an asset to our team in many ways."" Phoenix's Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and Paul hit a jumper to help send the Suns to the victory after blowing a 16-point lead. Jamal Murray's shot at the buzzer rimmed out. Ayton had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Devin Booker added 22, and Paul 21 for Phoenix, which won the night before in Utah. That's two big wins over two playoff teams from a season ago. “It just shows our resilience,” Paul said about blowing a second-half lead against Denver and bouncing back. “We want to learn in these situations and win at the same time.” Murray returned from a bruised right elbow and found his range early, scoring 14 of his 31 points in the first quarter. Nikola Jokic finished with 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds despite foul trouble. The Denver big man is posting big numbers but his production isn’t translating into wins as the Nuggets fell to 1-4. The Nuggets are struggling to find their rhythm after making the Western Conference finals last season. “Did a lot of really good things. Gave ourselves a chance,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “But this is not Year 1 or Year 2 where that’s acceptable. We lost another game. We lost another game at home. We have to be better.” The Nuggets were missing forward Michael Porter Jr., who was held out in accordance with the league’s health and safety protocols concerning COVID-19. Gone with him were 19.5 points per game. Phoenix appeared on its way to an easy win when Booker extended the lead to to 87-71 on a 3-pointer with 2:17 left in the third. But Denver stormed back, with Monte Morris giving the Nuggets a 98-97 lead on a 3-pointer with 2:41 remaining. Paul then hit two free throws and Booker a 3-pointer to restore some separation down the stretch. TIP-INS Suns: F Dario Saric (sore right quad) sat out on the second night of a back-to-back as a precaution. ... Williams said F/C Jalen Smith (sprained left ankle) is “on a course to be back here soon."" Nuggets: F JaMychal Green scored eight points in his Nuggets debut. The free-agent pickup missed the start of the season with a strained left calf. “Just happy to be back out there,"" he said. TEACHING MOMENT Nuggets coach Michael Malone is using the situation with Porter as a way to further emphasize the importance of adhering to all of the safety protocols in regard to the virus. Porter could miss multiple games because of contact tracing. “These are real protocols. They’re in place for a reason,” Malone said. “Unfortunate, but this is the current situation we’re in.” PRAISE FOR PAUL Count Malone as a big fan of Paul. “A first-ballot Hall of Famer,” Malone said.","401267236"
"Mike Conley drains a 3-pointer from the corner late as the Jazz hang on to defeat the Clippers 106-100. (0:16) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Mike Conley endured many frustrating moments during his first season after being traded to Utah from Memphis. Everything from injuries to struggles absorbing the Jazz offensive system kept him from finding a rhythm for much of last season. Conley is not feeling that same frustration in his second season with Utah. He made seven 3-pointers and scored a season-high 33 points to lead the Jazz to a 106-100 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. Conley consistently made the right reads on offense as evidenced by his seven assists. It added up to one big play after another for the veteran point guard. “He just did a great job of controlling the whole game and just making big plays for us,” forward Derrick Favors said. Conley came into the season with a focus on building off his solid performances inside the NBA bubble. In a short time, he’s already demonstrating his growth. He credited Utah coach Quin Snyder with giving him a chance to adapt and learn. “He stuck true to me,” Conley said. “He’s given me nothing but confidence.” Donovan Mitchell added 15 points for the Jazz. Favors chipped in with 14 points and 11 rebounds off the bench as Utah earned its first home victory of the season. Paul George had 25 points, eight rebounds and six steals to lead Los Angeles. Kawhi Leonard added 20 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists. The Clippers shot just 38.8% from the field. Los Angeles trailed by as many as 20 in the second half before rallying in the fourth quarter. The Clippers cut Utah’s lead to 95-94 after George drained a 3-pointer with 3:15 left. Rudy Gobert answered with a layup and then Conley sank his seventh 3 with 1:49 remaining to keep Los Angeles from overtaking the Jazz. “This is a hard-working team,” George said. “We play hard. We never count ourselves out. We continued fighting all the way to the end and gave ourselves a chance.” The Clippers became sluggish on offense as the first quarter progressed. Los Angeles shot just 25% from the field during that 12-minute stretch and scored only two baskets after taking a 13-11 lead on a 3-pointer from Nicolas Batum midway through the quarter. That opened the door for the Jazz to surge ahead late in the quarter, and Utah had no trouble finding its shot. The Jazz shot 52% from the floor during the opening period. Utah scored baskets on seven straight possessions and nine of 10 to fuel a 24-4 run over a 5½-minute stretch spanning the first and second quarters. Conley scored five of those baskets — including Utah’s final three field goals of the first quarter — and totaled 12 points in the first quarter alone. Jordan Clarkson and Conley punctuated the run with back-to-back 3s, giving the Jazz a 37-19 lead a minute into the second quarter. “Conley was great. He was special,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “We did a great job on Donovan and (Bojan) Bogdanovic, giving different looks and coverages … but Conley’s shot-making made the difference tonight.” The Clippers nearly erased the deficit before halftime. Los Angeles scored on four straight possessions, bookended by baskets from Leonard, to trim the deficit to 43-42. Utah weathered the surge and scored three straight baskets to end the half, capped by a dunk from Favors. The Jazz then opened the second half with three unanswered baskets and extended their lead to 67-47 on a corner 3 from Conley midway through the third quarter. “It was a fun night and a night we definitely needed,” Conley said. TIP-INS Clippers: George shot 6 of 21 from the field. … Leonard totaled 10 rebounds in his first three games of the season. … Los Angeles finished with just eight turnovers. Jazz: Joe Ingles set season highs in assists (seven) and rebounds (eight) to go with 11 points. … The NBA fined Clarkson $25,000 for shoving a referee during the second quarter of Utah’s 106-95 loss to Phoenix on Thursday. … The Jazz outscored the Clippers 46-30 in the paint. EMBRACING HIS ROLE Favors notched his first double-double in his second stint with the Jazz, finishing with season highs in points and rebounds. Friday was also the first time this season the veteran forward had more than 10 rebounds in a game. He averaged 5.5 rebounds through his previous four. Favors’ defensive mindset has bolstered Utah’s second unit. Coming off the bench is a new role for him, but one he has fully embraced since his return. “Credit to him, he’s always ready to play,” Snyder said. “Whatever you ask him to do, he’s going to embrace (it).” DIFFERENT KIND OF MASK Leonard played his second straight game wearing a protective facemask. The facial apparatus has been in place since he missed two games after taking an inadvertent elbow from teammate Serge Ibaka on Christmas. The blow caused a nasty laceration. Until the stitches come out, the mask stays on. The Clippers forward has averaged 24 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.0 assists in the mask. But that doesn’t mean he’s feeling comfortable in it. “I don’t know how you get used to wearing something like that on your head,” Leonard said. “I don’t want to wear it but I need to protect myself and it’ll be off soon.”","401267237"
"Damian Lillard drops 34 points in the Trail Blazers' blowout victory over the Warriors. (2:10) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Damian Lillard joined Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler as the only Portland players to score 15,000 points for the franchise, finishing with 34 as the Trail Blazers spoiled Golden State's home opener with a 123-98 win over the Warriors on Friday night. “Fifteen thousand is a huge accomplishment, something that I’m proud of but my work is far from done,” Lillard said. CJ McCollum added 28 points for Portland, knocking down 4 of 5 3-pointers early as the Trail Blazers hit 10 of 15 from long range to start the game. McCollum became the second player in NBA history to make 25 or more over the first five games of a season. Stephen Curry did it twice. He shot just 4 for 12 from deep and had 26 points, eight rebounds and five assists for the Warriors, Andrew Wiggins scored 15 and Kelly Oubre Jr. contributed 10 points in his first home game with the team. Golden State finally got back to Chase Center for its first home game in a 297-day span. But the Warriors took another lopsided loss following a 2-2 road trip in which they were outscored by 65 points in defeats at Brooklyn and Milwaukee then won at Chicago and Detroit by a combined 11 points. ""They came out smoking hot, they were making everything,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Lillard, from the Warriors’ former city of Oakland, shot 11 for 21 with six 3-pointers and also dished out eight assists. He averaged 43.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 8.0 assists in three games against the Warriors last season — including a 61-point performance on Jan. 20, 2020. Draymond Green didn't score and had four rebounds, four assists and four fouls over nearly 18 minutes making his season debut for Golden State, his first game since Feb. 27 against the Los Angeles Lakers and a stretch of 309 days. He had been sidelined the first four games by a right foot injury after being delayed starting training camp because he had the coronavirus. “Draymond just looks like he’s getting his wind. He looked like a guy who missed training camp and has been working his way to get onto the floor,” Kerr said. “It looked like an exhibition-style game for him. That’s not a criticism, it’s just where he is physically.” No. 2 overall draft pick James Wiseman gave Golden State a scare when he went down grabbing his left ankle late before walking off on his own. It wasn't serious and he is expected to play Sunday. Images of the late Clifford Robinson wearing both Warriors and Blazers jerseys were shown on the big screen during a first-quarter break. He died Aug. 29 at age 53. NO FANS The Warriors moved their championship banners down beneath one basket, a nice touch for fans to glimpse on TV. NEW YEAR’S HOOPS The Warriors played at home on New Year’s Day for just the fourth time in franchise history and the first time since a 125-93 win against the Kansas City Kings in 1982 for the 499th career coaching victory by Warriors Hall of Famer Al Attles. Golden State hadn't played Jan. 1 since 2011 at Miami. “I’m happy the year is ending, like most people. It’s been a lousy year for everybody,” Kerr said leading into the game. “As a coach my job is to remind our players that better times are ahead, on and off the court. On the court we had the worst record in the league in 2020. ... If you look at the off-the-court stuff, there is a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines and with just a glimpse of the future and we’ve got to all continue to try to inspire others to be smart, be safe, try to protect each other, wear our masks and be really patient and understand that we’re all going to get through this eventually. It’s not going to happen overnight.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Rodney Hood was limited to five minutes because of a cramp in his left quadriceps. ... Drexler scored 18,040 points. In Lillard's 620th game played, he tied Larry Bird as 21st-fastest in NBA history to score 15,000 points and fourth among active players behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony. ... Anthony's 18 points gave him 26,499 and he passed Tim Duncan (26,496) for 14th place on the all-time NBA scoring list. Warriors: The Warriors began 3 for 12 to fall behind 22-7. ...

"De'Aaron Fox uses a spin move through the lane to avoid the defense and goes up to put down a two-handed dunk. (0:15) HOUSTON -- — John Wall scored 28 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings 102-94 on Saturday despite playing without an injured James Harden. Harden, who sat out with a sprained right ankle, was not listed on the injury report and coach Stephen Silas did not mention his injury in his pregame availability. The team announced that he wouldn’t play about 38 minutes before the game was scheduled to begin. Wall, who sat out Houston's first two games because of COVID-19 contact tracing, missed all of last season and played just 32 games two years ago because of injuries. He scored 22 points in his Rockets' debut on Thursday after a trade from Washington to make him the first player to score 50 points in his first two games after an absence of at least two years since Michael Jordan did it in 2001, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. “I just put in a lot of hard work and dedication to get to this point,"" Wall said. “I couldn’t ask for a better start to be 2-0 in my first two games."" Silas wasn't sure what to expect from Wall after being out for so long. But he has definitely been impressed. “Whatever expectations I had, he’s obviously exceeded them,"" he said. The Rockets scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter to extend their lead to 92-81 with about 8½ minutes left. Eric Gordon led the team in that stretch, making a 3-pointer and three free throws. Sacramento ended a scoring drought of more than 3½ minutes soon after that on an alley-oop dunk by Richaun Holmes. Both teams struggled to score after that as they combined to miss 10 shots in a row. Gordon finally made a shot for Houston with just less than five minutes to go, and Wall added a bucket a few seconds later to extend the lead to 96-83. Silas raved about his team's defense on Saturday and said without Harden's scoring prowess it was even more important to concentrate on that part of the game. “We really buckled down and played some defense,"" Silas said. “In order for us to be good we have to be good on defense. We can’t just outscore people."" The Kings used an 8-2 run, capped by four points from Harrison Barnes, to get within 98-91 with less than a minute to go. But Christian Wood responded with a dunk to put the game out of reach. Harden had started Houston’s first three games this season and is averaging a league-leading 37 points with 11 assists. De’Aaron Fox had 23 points for the Kings, who lost to the Rockets for the second straight game after winning three of their first four games. “The guys should feel bad about the loss just like I do, losing is painful,"" coach Luke Walton said. “But they should also feel very good about how they are playing as a group.” He said they got stagnant offensively in the second half and was particularly disappointed in their lack of assists. “We only had 11 assists tonight as a team, which is awful,"" he said. “That’s not who we are as a group.” Wood had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Gordon added 21 points for Houston. The Kings cut the lead to two points on a 3-pointer by Buddy Hield with about 7½ minutes left in the third quarter. Wall made four quick points after that to stretch the lead to 79-73. The Rockets were up by seven late in the third before Fox scored the last five points of the quarter to cut the deficit to 83-81 entering the fourth. TIP-INS Kings: Barnes added 19 points with seven rebounds. ... Hield had 17 points and made five 3-pointers. ... Sacramento made 9 of 28 3-pointers.

"Malcolm Brogdon can't miss a shot as he puts up 17 points on 6-of-6 shooting in the first quarter. (0:29) INDIANAPOLIS -- — New coach Tom Thibodeau expects the New York Knicks to play tough and physical. He also knows a veteran like Austin Rivers can help show his young team how it's done. Rivers made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:23 to play and added another clutch basket during the game-sealing run Saturday night to help the Knicks record a rare 106-102 victory over Indiana. “I think the experience is huge and it gives us another guy who can put the ball on the floor,"" Thibodeau said. “He can makes 3s, he can play defense and I think that’s the way the league is going right now. I thought he made big shots, big plays and he’s still working his way through the conditioning piece of it.” Rivers missed New York's first four games with a groin injury before returning to the lineup Thursday. Two nights later, he made an impact. Less than two weeks after the Knicks lost to Indiana for the ninth time in 10 meetings, by a 14-point margin, Rivers helped them find a way to rebound. No, he wasn't the team's top scorer. That honor belonged to RJ Barrett, who had 25 points. And, no, Rivers didn't have a second straight double-double. That was Julius Randle, who had 13 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. But Rivers was effective inside and outside, and his teammates took the cue by following their coach's calling card. New York outrebounded Indiana 51-32, with the Pacers grabbing just five offensive rebounds. “That’s the difference in the game,"" Indiana guard Malcolm Brogdon said. “Their ability to rebound the ball and be physical inside was huge."" Brogdon led the Pacers with a career-high 33 points but his 3 was blocked by Mitchell Robinson with less than a minute to go, which led to Rivers' breakaway basket during the decisive 11-0 run. Neither team earned style points in a game played with typical post-holiday sluggishness. But after trailing 51-50 at the break, the Knicks opened the second half on a 16-5 scoring flurry to retake the lead and extend it to 66-56. And after Justin Holiday tied the score at 82 with a buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the third quarter, Randle broke the tie with a 3 to start the fourth. Then after Indiana charged back to take a 96-93 lead, Robinson started the closing run with a dunk. Rivers followed with the 3, and his breakaway basket sealed it. “(Thibodeau) just tells me to go play because he knows I really don’t have any familiarity with the sets,"" Rivers said. “The easiest thing to do sometimes is just go play.” TIP-INS Knicks: Barrett apparently likes playing at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, where he was 4 of 5 on 3s in this one and is 7 of 8 from long range this season. He is 0 for 21 on 3s in every other venue. ... Robinson had 16 points and nine rebounds. Pacers: Brogdon was 6 for 6 from the field in the first quarter. The rest of his teammates made just four first-period baskets. He finished 7 of 10 on 3s. ... Domantas Sabonis had his sixth straight double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds. ... Myles Turner had 17 points and one block. ... Indiana was 19 of 50 on 3s and forced 15 turnovers. HOLIDAY START Pacers guard Aaron Holiday made his third start of the season and his second straight in place of injured forward T.J. Warren. Warren is out indefinitely after having surgery on his left foot, meaning Aaron Holiday could see significant minutes for the foreseeable future. The Pacers need him to play better than he did Saturday, though. He missed all six shots, including five 3s, and did not score. He had two rebounds and one assist. “I think T.J. is the best pure scorer on the team,"" Brogdon said. “So that hurts us a lot.”","401267240"
"Magic pressure defense results in a loose ball picked up by Terrence Ross who wins a footrace for a bucket on the other end. (0:19) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Darius Bazley had a season-high 19 points, George Hill scored 13 of his 18 points in the third quarter and the Oklahoma City Thunder dominated the second half of a 108-99 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday. The Thunder ended a three-game losing streak and bounced back nicely from a 33-point loss to New Orleans two nights earlier. Oklahoma City also avenged a 118-107 home loss against the Magic five nights ago. “I just thought it was a good, resilient game for us because we carried a lot of stuff over from the New Orleans game that we wanted to address and from the last time we played Orlando,” coach Mark Daigneault said. “Orlando is a good team that makes you play a clean game to win and I was pleased with how we did that.” Orlando (4-2) has dropped two straight after starting the season 4-0. The Magic were routed 116-92 by Philadelphia on New Year’s Eve and lost on Saturday after making just 37% of their shots. Orlando was even worse in the fourth quarter when it made just eight of 28 shots (28.5%) and missed all 10 of its tries from 3-point range. That allowed the Thunder to outscore the Magic 24-17 over the final 12 minutes to break open a close game. “It started with one-on-one defense and we weren’t getting stops,” said Magic forward Aaron Gordon, who had 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists, but made only 6 of 15 field goal attempts. “It’s just one-on-one defense and that just comes down to pride, technique and energy.” Nikola Vucevic scored a season-best 30 points by making 13 of 21 shots, including four 3-pointers. He also grabbed 13 rebounds. Terrence Ross added 26 points and four 3-pointers off the Orlando bench. Six players scored in double digits for Oklahoma City, which shot 44.2% from the floor with 13 3-pointers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 16 points, while Al Horford, Hamidou Diallo and rookie Theo Maledon each scored 12 points. Bazley converted a driving, left-handed dunk with 4:37 left to give the Thunder a 99-91 lead, their largest of the night up to that point. Horford drilled a straight-on 3-pointer with 50 seconds to play, sending the Thunder on their way to the second road victory of the season. “Our coaches really harped on what we needed to improve upon from last game and we carried it over,” Horford said. “We did much better job of setting the tone early in the game.” The Thunder trailed by three points just after halftime, but they grabbed the lead late in the third quarter and never trailed the rest of the way. They outscored the Magic 22-15 in the fourth period. Standout guard Evan Fournier missed Saturday’s game with back spasms. Michael Carter-Williams started in place of Fournier and missed nine of his 11 shots and all four tries from 3-point range. “We struggled a little offensively, especially toward the end, because we didn’t work the offense enough and we could have gotten some better shots,” said Vucevic, who missed four of his six attempts in the final quarter. TIP INS Thunder: Saturday’s game was the first stop on a five-game, 10-day road trip for the Thunder. The trip will allow the Thunder to face two teams — Orlando and New Orleans — that they have already lost to this season. ... The Thunder entered Saturday’s game ranked 30th in the league in free throw percentage (62.3%), 29th in makes (12) and 28th in attempts (19.3). They were 19 of 21 from the line on Saturday. Magic: Orlando entered Saturday last in the league in 3-point attempts (26.8) and makes (8.8) per game. They hit just 10 of 38 attempts from beyond the arc on Saturday.","401267241"
"Seth Curry fires a beautiful no-look lob up to Ben Simmons at the hoop for a nice alley-oop in transition vs. the Hornets. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Tobias Harris punctuated a drive with a dynamic dunk that should have made a packed arena quake. He had to settle for leaving the Hornets shaken. Joel Embiid had 19 points and 14 rebounds and Harris scored 24 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 127-112 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Ben Simmons had 15 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to help the Sixers beat the Hornets for the 12th straight time. Philadelphia has not lost to Charlotte since Nov. 2, 2016. “When we're shooting the ball like that, we're dangerous,” coach Doc Rivers said. “We can every night. We have great shooters.” Terry Rozier scored 35 points for the Hornets. The Sixers are rolling in Rivers’ first season on the bench and followed a 24-point win over Orlando with another victory where they led by double digits for most of the game. Maligned in Philly for a paycheck not commensurate with his production, Harris has become the catch-and-shoot 3-point ace the Sixers needed to give them another scoring threat alongside All-Stars Embiid and Simmons. Yet it was Harris' full-court drive-and-dunk down the lane that posterized — or perhaps GIF’d in the modern era — Bismack Biyombo and left the Hornets reeling. “He’s made a huge leap from the past year to now,” Simmons said. The Sixers got a little something from everyone, including 21 points from Seth Curry and 13 from Danny Green, two offseason pickups the Sixers hoped would address outside shooting woes. “The key is, we're shooting well because we're getting open shots,” Green said. Harris blossomed when he played for the Clippers (43% on 3s) under Rivers before he was traded to Philadelphia in 2019. Harris stumbled from long-range in his 1 1/2 seasons with the 76ers only to find the reunion with his old coach the spark he needed to find his stroke. He hit all 3 attempts in the first half and the Sixers hit 12 of 22 overall before halftime to lead 73-58. “They’re making my job easier when they do that,” Simmons said. The Sixers hit a lull in the third. Green’s lazy entry pass was picked off by Rozier and Rivers threw up his hands in exasperation. Rozier hit Gordon Hayward for the bucket that cut it to 94-83 and the Sixers called timeout. No worries in Philly. Simmons scored consecutive buckets late in the fourth, the second on an alley-oop from Curry that had the Sixers drummers — aka the Sixers Stixers — going wild. Hey, someone had to with fans still banned from the Wells Fargo Center. TIP-INS: HORNETS: Coach James Borrego said it was too early in the season to consider shaking up the starting lineup. “If there’s changes to be made, we’re going to make them,” he said. That meant another game off the bench for the No. 3 overall pick, LaMelo Ball. Ball scored 13 points had four steals and continued to show flashes as the best Hornet on the court. 76ERS: F Mike Scott sat out with an injured left knee suffered Thursday in Orlando. SLUMPING GRAHAM The Hornets lost 108-93 to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night and got little production from Devonte’ Graham in both games. He missed nine of 10 shots and scored five points against the Sixers. He is 2-for-20 from the floor the last two nights. “I've just go to help him,” Borrego said. “It's on me to try to help Devonte. That's on me. He's going to do his part. He's going to put his work in. I've got to find him ways to get him better looks, open looks."" BANGED UP Borrego said forward PJ Washington played limited minutes in the second half because of a thumb issue. HE SAID IT Much like predecessor Brett Brown, Rivers downplays Simmons’ struggles from 3-point range. Simmons hit his first 3 of the season -- and third ever in 222 games — Thursday against Orlando. “We didn’t have a parade or anything, I can tell you that,” Rivers said.","401267242"
"JaVale McGee drives down the lane and somehow gets a left-handed layup to fall while being fouled. (0:20) ATLANTA -- — Collin Sexton scored 27 points, Andre Drummond had 12 points and 11 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers wiped out a 15-point deficit in the third quarter and beat the Atlanta Hawks 96-91 on Saturday night. The Cavs' keys to the game defensively were to prevent Atlanta from spending the whole game shooting free throws and from firing at will from beyond the arc, two categories in which the Hawks are among NBA leaders. “In the first quarter they were having their way with some 3s,"" Larry Nance Jr. said. “Get them off the free throw line, get them off the 3-point line and anything in between that we'll live with. Andre and JaVale are way too good at the rim contesting shots. It's hard to finish over that kind of length."" JaVale McGee, who finished with 14 points, scooped in a runner to help the Cavs reclaim the lead at 84-83, and Sexton made it a three-point lead with a 17-footer on the next possession to keep Atlanta on its heels. Clint Capela had 16 points and 16 rebounds for the Hawks, who had 22 turnovers in the final three quarters but tied it at 88-all on Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3 before Sexton hit a 3 to put the Cavs up 91-88 with 27.2 seconds remaining. John Collins missed an ensuing dunk attempt before Darius Garland hit a free throw and Sexton hit four foul shots to end the scoring in the closing seconds. “It feels good just to have my teammates behind me each night,"" Sexton said. “Early on they were like, ‘Keep going, keep going, you're going to get your rhythm.' ... They pretty much have a lot of confidence in me."" Collins' alley-oop dunk on a feed from Trae Young gave the Hawks their biggest lead at 15 points with 6:28 left in the third, but the Cavs went on an 18-5 run to trim it to 72-70 on Garland's 3 in the final minute of the period. They finally took the lead early in the fourth when Cedi Osman's 3-pointer from the right wing made it 76-74 with 9:47 remaining. Atlanta took its first double-digit lead when Young’s acrobatic layup made it 30-19 at the 2:49 mark of the first. Young had other highlights in the second, stealing the ball and passing from his knees to Cam Reddish for a layup that made it 45-35, and assisting Capela from the left side for an inside basket that kept the lead at 10 at the 2:39 mark. The Hawks, coming off a win at Brooklyn on Thursday, looked sluggish throughout, but still carried a 56-44 lead into intermission. The closest Cleveland got in the second quarter was a 3 by Osman that made it 53-44, but Kevin Huerter quickly followed with a 3 from the right wing to push the lead back to 12. The Hawks began the game leading the NBA in scoring (125.8) and free throws made per game (25.2), and ranking second in 3-pointer made, second-chance points (17.0) and rebounds (49.4). “It happened tonight where they're in a rhythm and getting back into the game,"" Young said. “We've just got to lock in a little bit more.""

"Brandon Ingram goes to the free throw line and says, ""It's over"" multiple times as he knocks down both shots to ice the game for a Pelicans win over the Raptors. (0:43) NEW ORLEANS -- — Eric Bledsoe capped a 19-point, 10-assist performance with a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute, and the New Orleans Pelicans held on for a 120-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night. Brandon Ingram added 31 points, capped by four free throws in the last 13 seconds to seal the victory. Zion Williamson scored 21 points, highlighted by a pair of driving spin moves in the lane to set up left-handed leaners off the glass. The Pelicans lost a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter, briefly falling behind in the final four minutes, but were able clamp down defensively and limit the Raptors to just one point during the final 2:47. “The thing I like the best is our resilience,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “It’s not easy to give up a double-digit lead with (8:30) to go and then go behind. A lot of teams sort of fade away at that point.” Fred VanVleet scored 27 points and Chris Boucher added 24 for Toronto. Pascal Siakam scored 10 points, but fouled out with 8:30 remaining. “He struggled, there was no doubt about it,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Siakam. “He had a few decent plays and a few good drives in there, but again he obviously struggled.” The Pelicans led 101-89 when Josh Hart made a free throw just after Siakam fouled out. But Kyle Lowry quickly responded with a 3, igniting a 22-9 run that ended with 3s by OG Anunoby, Powell and VanVleet to put Toronto up 111-110 with 3:16 to go. Ingram's free throws tied it at 113 with 1:08 left. And after Toronto lost the ball out of bounds, Bledsoe hit his pivotal left-wing 3 with 41.6 seconds left. “I was kind of locked in,"" Beldsoe said, noting that he expected Toronto to double-team Ingram and leave someone open on the perimeter. ""I was just trying to stay ready and when I got the ball I was going to shoot it with confidence.” VanVleet scored 11 of his 21 first-half points during the last seven minutes of the second period to push Toronto in front late in the half. Lowery added a 3 from 30 feet away to put the Raptors up 60-50 before a 3 by Lonzo Ball and Steven Adams' putback dunk trimmed it to 60-55 at halftime. Although they've lost four of their first five games, the Raptors didn't sound inclined to start panicking yet. “Once we start winning some games and get a lot of minutes — good minutes — together as a team playing solid defense, and getting stops, and running, and things like that, you know, it’ll get back to normal,” Siakam said. ""I just think that the game is focusing on little things and continuing to get better as a team and an individual.” TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto went 26 of 27 on foul shots. ... The Raptors came in having won five straight in New Orleans and eight of the previous 10 meetings overall but have been swept this season by the Pelicans. ... Toronto got 38 points from its bench, most coming from Boucher. ... Lowry was called for a flagrant-1 foul in the second half when he fell backward while guarding Bledsoe on the dribble, and while lying on the floor, reached across Beldsoe’s legs as the Pelicans guard began to drive. Bledsoe went down flat on his front side. Pelicans: Adams and Ball each scored 13 points and Adams added nine rebounds. ... The Pelicans outrebounded Toronto 51-39. ... The Pelicans attempted 47 free throws, the second-most in franchise history, but missed 11. ... New Orleans improved to 2-0 at home. ... Second-year reserve center Jaxson Hayes grabbed eight rebounds in 16 minutes and drew praise from his coach. “We got really, really good energy and really productive minutes from Jaxson Hayes,” Van Gundy said. ""He was outstanding.” MEA CULPA Van Gundy said he couldn't play Williamson as much as he wanted to in the final few minutes because he had lost a timeout when he unsuccessfully challenged a foul called against New Orleans in the second half. “I made a huge mistake in the game that you guys should all write about and criticize me for because you'll sound like you really know what's going on,” Van Gundy said, noting that even though he thought he might win the challenge, it was too risky to jeopardize what few timeouts he had left. “We should have never challenged that."" Van Gundy explained that he felt matchups dictated removing Williamson in favor of having four perimeter players to defend in the final minutes, adding, ""We couldn't take a timeout to get (Williamson) back in on offense.”","401267244"
